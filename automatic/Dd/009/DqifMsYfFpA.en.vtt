00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:20.539
 hello today is very short and 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:22.369
 clear enough and video as before 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:26.590
 than my hands in the lens 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:29.509
 I want to tell you how you can do 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:32.660
 carriage in my opinion spray 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:33.500
 for air for aquarium and for this 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.520
 took 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:40.150
 took the old used 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.150
 dropper 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:49.340
 that this law surely know here 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:58.150
 daughter cut it laid aside air traffic 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:58.150
 the remaining part is cut off or 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:07.370
 too, too, on the side but not throwing away 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.210
 because after all this 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:10.910
 dismantling 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.850
 here they are now periodically 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:18.430
 unnecessary bonus come in handy here 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:20.210
 looks the same thing that's left 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.180
 left by myself 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:27.080
 in general, here it is a sprayer here 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:31.630
 very cute little mesh very small 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.630
 mesh left here 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:39.530
 supply medication regulator 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.420
 in this case we will have it 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.930
 air regulator 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:49.729
 by the way very nice comfortable thin 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:53.470
 feed regulator and a was put to the end 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:56.570
 there was a needle here dressed 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:59.150
 I left such a rubber 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:03.310
 rubber tip is very soft 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:05.810
 tip it is useful to us 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.020
 literally the meaning of the word with him and begin 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.000
 these are soft 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.000
 am am I connected with a compress 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:22.099
 connection provided thereby 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:29.420
 reliable connection here moved closer 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:29.420
 compressor air regulator and 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:40.110
 left here this spray principle 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:45.470
 here it is a ready system for spraying 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:49.670
 air but it can be improved 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:53.329
 for example how can you use the tubes 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:58.579
 for a cocktail you know these are the tubes 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:03:04.519
 here they bend easily 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:11.250
 these ducts to lay 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:18.410
 track in the aquarium is done very 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:23.510
 easy and simple here 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:26.180
 sealed with silicone sealant 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:31.290
 it will have to hold 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:35.100
 night here and so on that is but it is me 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:39.980
 the straw began to show you what it was like 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:43.109
 can I do for example 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:48.959
 this part over silicone sealant 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:51.780
 secured an ordinary sucker side 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:54.349
 suction cup glass 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.239
 attached very well 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:58.260
 sprays corners but you can do 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:03.530
 across the aquarium 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:05.930
 and if you take a plastic tube 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:08.569
 larger diameter let's say twice 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:13.280
 more than the diameter of what is used 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:18.430
 droppers and you cut the girls can 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:23.480
 by sticking in a few such 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:25.280
 sprayers and then along for example 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:29.120
 back walls of the aquarium or in 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:36.490
 random order at the bottom of the aquarium 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:40.610
 you can put here such sprayers 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:43.400
 can make another zucchini folded 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:46.010
 small idol how to twist 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:50.030
 so here and disguise in this graph 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:55.550
 this sprayer is great too 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:05:00.530
 do get the result well what I want 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:04.000
 say crying thanks to this one 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:11.140
 combination thanks to this combination 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:11.140
 you can get a very thin 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:17.090
 a stream of bubbles but how thin they are 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:20.150
 a row that the bubbles will be very small 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:23.660
 Well, literally with poppy size 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:27.830
 the seed may be a little bit more to 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:32.270
 beautifully these bubbles 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:35.180
 rise can do several 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:38.270
 more can boiling stream 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:39.270
 but what is characteristic contrary to what is here 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:42.450
 highly 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:46.800
 then mesh means about these bubbles 

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:52.470
 It turns out how soft they do not cause 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:55.200
 such a powerful stream of water and therefore from 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.390
 application in 20 watt glands with 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:01.110
 by sailors 

00:05:56.390 --> 00:06:03.720
 I am very framed in this way 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:06.020
 my first sprayer set in 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:10.650
 otsadnik with fry 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:13.010
 Swordsmen next video I'll show you 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:15.960
 how does it work this sprayer 

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:19.760
 directly in the aquarium I think that 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:27.900
 you will like and want to repeat my 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:30.480
 simple well, useful and necessary experience in 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:32.690
 Thank you for your attention to this question. 

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.690
