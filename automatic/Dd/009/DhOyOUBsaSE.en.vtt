00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.740 
want to help them
I<00:03:33.359> just<00:03:34.229> feel<00:03:34.620> whatever<00:03:34.829> it<00:03:35.099> is<00:03:35.250> and<00:03:35.579> yeah<00:03:36.299> yeah

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
I just feel whatever it is and yeah yeah

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.050 
I just feel whatever it is and yeah yeah
and<00:03:37.079> guilt<00:03:37.349> is<00:03:37.500> actually<00:03:37.949> the<00:03:38.159> opposite<00:03:38.819> when

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
and guilt is actually the opposite when

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.149 
and guilt is actually the opposite when
we<00:03:39.120> have<00:03:39.239> that<00:03:39.389> positive<00:03:39.810> negative<00:03:40.159> balance

00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:41.159 
we have that positive negative balance

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:43.069 
we have that positive negative balance
is<00:03:41.310> the<00:03:41.430> positive<00:03:41.879> word<00:03:42.030> for<00:03:42.269> green<00:03:42.479> but<00:03:42.810> guilt

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:43.079 
is the positive word for green but guilt

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:45.140 
is the positive word for green but guilt
is<00:03:43.379> the<00:03:43.859> negative<00:03:44.220> because<00:03:44.370> green<00:03:44.790> energy

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
is the negative because green energy

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.479 
is the negative because green energy
people<00:03:45.359> feel<00:03:45.750> tons<00:03:46.139> of<00:03:46.560> guilt<00:03:46.829> because<00:03:47.069> they

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
people feel tons of guilt because they

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.129 
people feel tons of guilt because they
want<00:03:47.699> to<00:03:47.790> serve<00:03:48.030> they<00:03:48.299> want<00:03:48.509> to<00:03:48.599> help<00:03:48.810> and<00:03:49.049> if

want to serve they want to help and if

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:51.559 
want to serve they want to help and if
they<00:03:49.290> can't<00:03:49.620> they<00:03:49.949> their<00:03:50.489> whole<00:03:50.699> body<00:03:51.000> as<00:03:51.359> you
