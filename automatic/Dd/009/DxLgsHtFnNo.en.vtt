00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
don't feel that at all I feel really

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.349 
don't feel that at all I feel really
just<00:04:18.720> clean<00:04:19.049> and

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
just clean and

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.379 
just clean and
the<00:04:22.079> conditioner<00:04:22.620> I<00:04:22.650> just<00:04:23.159> put<00:04:23.460> it<00:04:23.580> on<00:04:23.639> my<00:04:23.849> ends

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:26.029 
the conditioner I just put it on my ends
let<00:04:24.569> it<00:04:24.659> sit<00:04:24.840> there<00:04:25.020> for<00:04:25.050> a<00:04:25.229> second<00:04:25.620> washed<00:04:25.830> it

let it sit there for a second washed it
right<00:04:26.189> out<00:04:26.400> and<00:04:26.669> I<00:04:27.629> think<00:04:28.289> they're<00:04:28.439> just<00:04:28.470> as

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.820 
right out and I think they're just as
shiny<00:04:29.009> as<00:04:29.189> ever<00:04:29.669> so<00:04:30.509> I<00:04:30.840> like<00:04:31.229> the<00:04:31.379> conditioner

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.240 
shiny as ever so I like the conditioner
as<00:04:31.979> well<00:04:32.189> I<00:04:32.490> might<00:04:33.449> still<00:04:33.810> do<00:04:34.050> a<00:04:34.439> hair<00:04:34.949> mask

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
as well I might still do a hair mask

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.850 
as well I might still do a hair mask
maybe<00:04:35.669> once<00:04:35.939> a<00:04:36.090> week<00:04:36.120> just<00:04:36.569> to<00:04:36.689> give<00:04:37.409> an<00:04:37.530> extra

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
maybe once a week just to give an extra

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.580 
maybe once a week just to give an extra
boost<00:04:38.159> of<00:04:38.340> moisture<00:04:38.750> not<00:04:39.750> that<00:04:39.930> the<00:04:40.139> product

boost of moisture not that the product
is<00:04:40.710> lacking<00:04:40.949> but<00:04:41.250> just<00:04:41.430> because<00:04:41.520> my<00:04:41.729> hair<00:04:41.939> is

00:04:41.959 --> 00:04:41.969
