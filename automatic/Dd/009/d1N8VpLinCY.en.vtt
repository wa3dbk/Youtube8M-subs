00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.920
 good people welcome to my channel 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.650
 again, I 'll tell you how you are 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.360
 listening listens rather better not 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.610
 I say we much stronger and 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.070
 quite with better quality not since 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.570
 as you already know with the new helmets 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.490
 well, as you are seeing from funds 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.080
 whites two double nuclear with the 94 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.590
 pretty fast the truth is that it's 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.830
 cropped and good is a lot of equipment with 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.960
 the wizards with the you know but good 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.210
 of the air is right and is that they were 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.240
 pretty good, not if you look at the end 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.980
 of the rental item and they are 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.810
 groups of two groups of three if I do not 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.820
 wrong and good get a master 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.800
 of these people because it is not so easy either 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.940
 not because you already know the typical groups 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.160
 that there is usually in multi team that 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.290
 they are quite initiated and not good 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.520
 leave let not breathe not so in this 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.860
 case if we did that was 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.290
 playing with a trasto and you I close and 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.520
 Well, we are playing and it came out 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:04.470
 this does not 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:06.120
 many that is not talking with well and 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.390
 others and he has not told me that he had 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.610
 eggs and to see if there were eggs to do 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.030
 a 2.0 and well I have made that we follow 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.160
 600 or 500 the left 500 lay in this 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.470
 video if this video you come to the 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:25.200
 500 likes the project that can be a 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:29.640
 2.0 with my face and well it is a 2.0 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.020
 good 600 life for 2.0 and good 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.290
 also another thing to tell you that Friday 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.700
 I'll go up on Friday or on Saturday they get 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.990
 I suppose on Saturday uploading the unboxing 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.060
 of the scud and well that is also had 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.610
 I thought about making you a 2.0 but not with my 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.520
 camera or not with my face but 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.930
 with my hands it is worth to wish us as 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.710
 game I heard the first game at 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:55.649
 live with the live with the scoop with the most 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.750
 so you can see how he jumped like everything and not 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:02.009
 I know if they could fly us and good if 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:04.770
 we reach 250 laws I will do or 656 today 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.600
 forgiveness 205 such 500 law remaining 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.940
 let's continue here we understand 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.550
 the points but I do not know when I'm ready and 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.900
 Well, if you want to vote for it 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.930
 under the comments something of what 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.400
 unknown from the hand that premiere 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.440
 for youtubers it seems that I think that 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.510
 and in these it's pretty cool that 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.810
 well, you see how he reacted, not like 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.640
 reactions of rapid reaction that 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.530
 I have not when when the enemy comes and 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.410
 others do not is also quite good 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.290
 see it even if you do not see even if you do not see the 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.660
 mind not but it's pretty good to know 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.700
 what you know how fast he reacted to 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.470
 time I have ration and others I can 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.450
 tell you that it is a nuclear double as os 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.670
 I said that good as you saw 2007 in 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.069
 the time of triple more or less but 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.209
 good for reasons names that do not 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.440
 because they were pretty good 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.750
 everything has to be said they were pretty 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.250
 good and me then in these times 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.290
 is not very experienced either 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.269
 bad is shut down nuclear type like ya 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.850
 you know in barracks but good and that I 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.500
 he's got quite a lot of little things 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:04.200
 mochales I hope you can the video that 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.610
 you already know 500 the waters 2.0 that the 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.090
 techniques because the truth is not 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:12.600
 I have a webcam I've lost and if you want 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:15.120
 what to also vote about boxing 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.980
 a box and not apart from that you'll see 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.660
 me what 2.0 with my hands that could 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.100
 be pretty good as well as kids 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.510
 I hope you liked the gameplay 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.700
 that you enjoy the first half of 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.140
 good thing is the water of a fate 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.360
 just in case nothing said, although everyone already 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.420
 we know we do not know more than about 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.980
 these maps and well now I hope that you 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.600
 I liked that you voted the video that 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.340
 who will succeed to repeat me but already 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.600
 you know and I do not like to comment on 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.160
 helmets I do not know if I buy basically for 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.410
 play and not play it and scoop 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.090
 you know why now I'm engaged in something 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.490
 more competitive than probably 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.960
 bring something down the channel so I hope 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.250
 that you liked a greeting 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.830

 on my way 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.890
 orders 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.120
 to humiliated himself
