00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:06.920
 today we prepare a simple and healthy rich 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.920
 dessert with yogurt and apple 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.480
 the first thing we are going to do 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.940
 is to cut the apple in two because we're going 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.400
 to use one half for each of 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.200
 the two desserts that we are going to make is 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.600
 heart masters with the help of a lace 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.810
 it's pretty simple we eliminate 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.790
 any rest of hard or any 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.980
 nugget that we can find that 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.650
 then it would be quite unpleasant in the 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.590
 mouth 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.660
 and we went directly to peel it if you 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.910
 like apple with skin and you have it 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.000
 well washed as you can also leave 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:56.030
 and it adds a touch of color to the dessert that 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.760
 I leave it to your choice I have used 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.590
 these green apples because they are 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.230
 quite acidic and they do a control in 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.940
 pretty nice contrast with the 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.300
 yogurt but you can use any 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.870
 another type the one you like the most 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:14.240
 we give him some cuts along and then 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:17.900
 we rotate and width because the objective 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:22.370
 is to take squares a few squares 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:24.140
 cubes as regular as we can the 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.230
 rope is quite simple doing it 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:30.050
 This way we will all be left 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:32.750
 very very similar once the 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:35.540
 we have a glass that is where 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.810
 let's introduce and put a bed 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:41.060
 more or less with half the apple 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.640
 approximately we put a jet 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.730
 generous of honey that will give you a 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.430
 sweet touch a different touch and 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:51.170
 then we fill with the yogurt yo 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.000
 I have used a yogurt soya a yogurt 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.720
 very light but you can use 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.340
 any other that is sugary 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:02.540
 fill with half the yogurt and 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:04.250
 we make another layer of apple with a 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.160
 little less than half we will leave 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:11.110
 few for the surface a few 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.970
 square we put a little more honey 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.790
 as I said before to the taste of 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.280
 each one 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.310
 and we finished putting the other half of the 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.829
 yogurt on top until it covers already 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.409
 we only have to finish putting it 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:27.900
 the pieces that we have reserved for the 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:29.700
 final and this is the result is 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.840
 I highly recommend it, I hope you 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.840
 have liked until another 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.709
 you have not yet subscribed to what are you 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.709
 waiting to be part of the team
