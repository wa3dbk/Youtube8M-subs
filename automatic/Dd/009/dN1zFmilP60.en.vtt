so<00:01:50.470> let's<00:01:50.650> talk<00:01:50.740> about<00:01:50.980> those<00:01:51.160> as<00:01:51.340> well<00:01:52.080> yeah<00:01:53.080> I

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
so let's talk about those as well yeah I

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.330 
so let's talk about those as well yeah I
mean<00:01:53.740> it's<00:01:54.010> like<00:01:54.640> I<00:01:54.790> said<00:01:55.060> previously<00:01:56.340> the

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
mean it's like I said previously the

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.910 
mean it's like I said previously the
movie<00:01:57.820> kind<00:01:58.450> of<00:01:58.600> I<00:01:58.900> think<00:01:59.380> that<00:01:59.560> was<00:01:59.680> the<00:01:59.770> thing

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
movie kind of I think that was the thing

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.410 
movie kind of I think that was the thing
that<00:01:59.950> I<00:02:00.100> was<00:02:00.190> most<00:02:00.370> worried<00:02:00.700> about<00:02:00.760> was<00:02:01.180> the

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
that I was most worried about was the

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.050 
that I was most worried about was the
tone<00:02:01.630> because<00:02:02.530> I<00:02:03.220> didn't<00:02:03.610> really<00:02:03.790> know<00:02:03.940> how

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
tone because I didn't really know how

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.170 
tone because I didn't really know how
they<00:02:04.150> were<00:02:04.240> gonna<00:02:04.330> pull<00:02:04.630> off<00:02:06.420> vampire<00:02:07.420> girls

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:08.180 
they were gonna pull off vampire girls

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.330 
they were gonna pull off vampire girls

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
necessarily and it totally works because

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.000

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
think it stays really true to the story

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.180 
think it stays really true to the story
into<00:05:35.910> the<00:05:36.030> characters<00:05:36.680> the<00:05:37.680> only<00:05:37.890> difference

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
into the characters the only difference

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.460 
into the characters the only difference
is<00:05:38.310> kind<00:05:38.520> of<00:05:38.580> like<00:05:38.730> they're<00:05:38.940> more<00:05:39.270> little<00:05:40.200> like

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 
is kind of like they're more little like

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.530 
is kind of like they're more little like
one-liner<00:05:41.190> jokes<00:05:41.310> and<00:05:41.850> that's<00:05:42.030> pretty<00:05:42.300> much

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:42.540 
one-liner jokes and that's pretty much

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.480 
one-liner jokes and that's pretty much
the<00:05:43.320> furthest<00:05:43.710> thing<00:05:43.740> that<00:05:44.010> it<00:05:44.130> strays<00:05:44.340> from

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
the furthest thing that it strays from

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.610 
the furthest thing that it strays from
the<00:05:44.840> book<00:05:45.840> and<00:05:45.990> I<00:05:46.050> think<00:05:46.110> there's<00:05:46.380> many<00:05:46.440> to<00:05:46.560> be

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
the book and I think there's many to be

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:47.480 
the book and I think there's many to be
said<00:05:46.740> about<00:05:46.830> the<00:05:46.950> fact<00:05:47.100> that<00:05:47.130> Richelle<00:05:47.460> Mead

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490
