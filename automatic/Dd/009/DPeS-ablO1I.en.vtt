digging<00:00:09.150> out<00:00:09.360> roots<00:00:09.960> of<00:00:10.200> polynomials<00:00:11.099> we<00:00:11.820> have

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
digging out roots of polynomials we have

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.450 
digging out roots of polynomials we have
a<00:00:12.059> lot<00:00:12.840> of<00:00:12.870> questions<00:00:13.530> regarding<00:00:14.009> this<00:00:14.190> topic

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
a lot of questions regarding this topic

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.730 
a lot of questions regarding this topic
and<00:00:14.910> I<00:00:15.360> thought<00:00:15.570> I<00:00:15.630> want<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:15.929> make<00:00:16.080> a<00:00:16.109> two<00:00:16.470> part

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
and I thought I want to make a two part

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.269 
and I thought I want to make a two part
video<00:00:16.920> series<00:00:17.690> on<00:00:18.690> what<00:00:19.500> are<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.859> roots<00:00:20.070> of

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
video series on what are the roots of

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.519 
video series on what are the roots of
polynomial<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.210> how<00:00:21.480> do<00:00:21.539> we<00:00:21.660> really<00:00:21.990> dig<00:00:22.350> out

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
polynomial and how do we really dig out

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.820 
polynomial and how do we really dig out
whenever<00:00:23.220> I<00:00:23.460> think<00:00:24.060> of<00:00:24.269> roots<00:00:24.660> of<00:00:24.930> polynomials

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
whenever I think of roots of polynomials

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.040 
whenever I think of roots of polynomials
and<00:00:26.099> digging<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.760> roots<00:00:26.970> out<00:00:27.150> I<00:00:27.510> think<00:00:27.869> of

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
and digging the roots out I think of

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.370 
and digging the roots out I think of
truffles<00:00:28.680> no<00:00:29.640> truffles<00:00:30.119> are<00:00:30.330> among<00:00:31.140> one<00:00:31.349> of

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
truffles no truffles are among one of

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.180 
truffles no truffles are among one of
the<00:00:31.679> most<00:00:32.099> expensive<00:00:33.000> nature<00:00:33.630> of<00:00:33.750> food<00:00:34.190> cost

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
the most expensive nature of food cost

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.840 
the most expensive nature of food cost
anywhere<00:00:35.640> from<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:36.450> thousand<00:00:36.989> bucks<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.850> 2200

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
anywhere from a thousand bucks to 2200

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.910 
anywhere from a thousand bucks to 2200
per<00:00:39.120> pound<00:00:39.390> for<00:00:39.660> white<00:00:40.110> truffle<00:00:40.590> even<00:00:40.829> the

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
per pound for white truffle even the

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.610 
per pound for white truffle even the
black<00:00:41.190> ones<00:00:41.460> goes<00:00:42.329> anywhere<00:00:42.750> between<00:00:42.930> 300<00:00:43.350> to

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
black ones goes anywhere between 300 to

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.549 
black ones goes anywhere between 300 to
600<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:44.700> thought<00:00:44.969> you<00:00:45.539> know<00:00:45.570> that's<00:00:46.289> that's

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
600 and I thought you know that's that's

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.860 
600 and I thought you know that's that's
a<00:00:46.710> good<00:00:46.890> analogy<00:00:47.129> for<00:00:47.460> digging<00:00:48.239> out<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.480> roots

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
a good analogy for digging out the roots

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.779 
a good analogy for digging out the roots
you<00:00:49.530> might<00:00:49.739> be<00:00:49.860> wondering<00:00:50.070> what<00:00:50.489> are<00:00:50.670> the

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
you might be wondering what are the

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.970 
you might be wondering what are the
roots<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.270> polynomial<00:00:52.020> so<00:00:52.440> well<00:00:52.590> let's<00:00:52.770> talk

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
roots of polynomial so well let's talk

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.380 
roots of polynomial so well let's talk
about<00:00:53.039> so<00:00:53.670> we're<00:00:54.510> in<00:00:54.809> this<00:00:54.960> part<00:00:55.289> 1<00:00:55.530> series<00:00:56.039> um

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
about so we're in this part 1 series um

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.930 
about so we're in this part 1 series um
I'll<00:00:57.390> give<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:57.809> what's<00:00:58.199> up<00:00:58.670> what<00:00:59.670> other

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
I'll give you what's up what other

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.979 
I'll give you what's up what other
routes<00:01:00.920> and<00:01:02.000> that<00:01:03.000> gives<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.480> hopefully

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
routes and that gives you a hopefully

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.200 
routes and that gives you a hopefully
also<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.949> question<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.369> why<00:01:05.519> we<00:01:05.700> care<00:01:05.939> in<00:01:06.119> the

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
also the question of why we care in the

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.270 
also the question of why we care in the
first<00:01:06.390> place<00:01:06.689> and<00:01:06.990> then<00:01:07.560> we'll<00:01:07.710> talk<00:01:07.950> about<00:01:08.010> a

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
first place and then we'll talk about a

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.039 
first place and then we'll talk about a
how<00:01:08.670> we<00:01:09.299> dig<00:01:09.540> out<00:01:09.750> how<00:01:10.650> we<00:01:10.710> dig<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.460> what<00:01:12.049> how

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
how we dig out how we dig and what how

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.510 
how we dig out how we dig and what how
we<00:01:13.680> dig<00:01:14.130> out<00:01:15.290> roots

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
we dig out roots

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.469 
we dig out roots
okay<00:01:17.670> and<00:01:17.990> then<00:01:18.990> here<00:01:19.729> I'm<00:01:20.729> going<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.030> use<00:01:21.210> the

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
okay and then here I'm going to use the

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.800 
okay and then here I'm going to use the
computer<00:01:22.579> scientists<00:01:23.579> analogy<00:01:24.539> there's<00:01:24.750> a

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
computer scientists analogy there's a

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.899 
computer scientists analogy there's a
whole<00:01:24.990> buncha<00:01:25.350> loops<00:01:25.560> will<00:01:25.860> go<00:01:26.009> through<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.820> I

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
whole buncha loops will go through and I

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.880 
whole buncha loops will go through and I
go<00:01:27.090> through<00:01:27.329> it<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.750> why<00:01:27.990> we<00:01:28.289> do<00:01:28.469> and<00:01:28.649> how<00:01:28.860> we

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
go through it and why we do and how we

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.270 
go through it and why we do and how we
do<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:29.429> and<00:01:29.610> then<00:01:30.179> using<00:01:30.659> this<00:01:30.979> example<00:01:31.979> we

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
do it and then using this example we

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.490 
do it and then using this example we
were<00:01:32.369> given<00:01:32.729> here<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.270> think<00:01:33.899> it's<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.259> pretty

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
were given here I think it's a pretty

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.850 
were given here I think it's a pretty
good<00:01:34.619> illustration<00:01:35.369> of<00:01:36.060> this<00:01:36.929> typical

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
good illustration of this typical

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.069 
good illustration of this typical
problem<00:01:38.310> what<00:01:38.789> are<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.030> roots<00:01:39.209> and<00:01:39.509> why<00:01:39.810> do<00:01:39.869> we

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
problem what are the roots and why do we

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.289 
problem what are the roots and why do we
care<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.740> dig<00:01:40.920> them<00:01:41.130> out<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.579> how<00:01:41.819> do<00:01:41.880> we<00:01:42.030> dig

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
care to dig them out and how do we dig

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.389 
care to dig them out and how do we dig
it<00:01:42.450> up<00:01:42.539> so<00:01:42.929> let's<00:01:43.140> address<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.860> first<00:01:44.130> part

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
it up so let's address the first part

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.760 
it up so let's address the first part
what<00:01:44.969> are<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.179> roots<00:01:45.420> now<00:01:46.079> here<00:01:46.380> what<00:01:46.619> I<00:01:46.649> have

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
what are the roots now here what I have

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.330 
what are the roots now here what I have
is<00:01:47.399> using<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.119> wolfgram<00:01:48.929> as<00:01:49.319> a<00:01:49.380> computer<00:01:50.009> aid

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
is using the wolfgram as a computer aid

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.819 
is using the wolfgram as a computer aid
and<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.789> wonder<00:01:51.360> how<00:01:51.539> to<00:01:51.599> plot<00:01:51.989> it<00:01:52.049> out<00:01:52.409> this

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
and a wonder how to plot it out this

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.710 
and a wonder how to plot it out this
function<00:01:53.459> and<00:01:53.640> this<00:01:53.700> function<00:01:53.759> we<00:01:54.360> were<00:01:54.509> to

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
function and this function we were to

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.199 
function and this function we were to
fund<00:01:54.989> at<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.259> roots<00:01:55.470> roots<00:01:56.340> are<00:01:56.729> actually

00:01:57.199 --> 00:01:57.209 
fund at the roots roots are actually

00:01:57.209 --> 00:02:02.270 
fund at the roots roots are actually
just<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:58.189> fancy<00:01:59.189> word<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.970> see<00:02:00.649> where<00:02:01.649> is<00:02:01.979> the

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
just a fancy word to see where is the

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.490 
just a fancy word to see where is the
function<00:02:02.819> here<00:02:03.360> is<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.630> function<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:04.289> seemed

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
x-axis where does the function cross x

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.470 
x-axis where does the function cross x
axis<00:02:10.079> it<00:02:10.289> has<00:02:10.470> to<00:02:10.679> be<00:02:10.709> x<00:02:10.979> x<00:02:11.450> so<00:02:12.450> x<00:02:13.019> axis<00:02:13.920> because

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
axis it has to be x x so x axis because

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.119 
axis it has to be x x so x axis because
we're<00:02:15.480> really<00:02:15.810> looking<00:02:16.079> for<00:02:16.319> the<00:02:16.590> special

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
we're really looking for the special

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.240 
we're really looking for the special
values<00:02:17.640> such<00:02:18.329> that<00:02:18.360> as<00:02:18.750> X<00:02:19.019> where<00:02:19.860> an<00:02:19.950> across

the<00:02:20.280> x-axis<00:02:20.849> when<00:02:21.780> you<00:02:21.870> plug<00:02:22.170> into<00:02:22.410> this

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
the x-axis when you plug into this

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.949 
the x-axis when you plug into this
complex<00:02:23.160> function<00:02:23.790> you<00:02:24.239> end<00:02:24.480> up<00:02:24.600> with<00:02:24.810> the

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
complex function you end up with the

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.199 
complex function you end up with the
zero<00:02:25.350> okay<00:02:25.950> that's<00:02:26.190> where<00:02:26.489> we<00:02:26.639> call<00:02:26.850> the<00:02:27.000> roots

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
zero okay that's where we call the roots

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.520 
zero okay that's where we call the roots
so<00:02:27.569> here<00:02:27.989> are<00:02:28.139> the<00:02:28.579> roots<00:02:29.579> are<00:02:29.910> the<00:02:30.530> truffles

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
so here are the roots are the truffles

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.660 
so here are the roots are the truffles
or<00:02:32.120> we<00:02:33.120> call<00:02:33.359> it<00:02:33.510> zeroes<00:02:33.959> or<00:02:34.230> in<00:02:34.920> our<00:02:35.069> case<00:02:35.100> way

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
or we call it zeroes or in our case way

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.160 
or we call it zeroes or in our case way
we<00:02:36.030> think<00:02:36.600> it<00:02:36.810> as<00:02:37.280> truffles<00:02:38.690> okay<00:02:39.690> so<00:02:39.959> how<00:02:40.109> do

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
we think it as truffles okay so how do

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.319 
we think it as truffles okay so how do
we<00:02:40.290> dig<00:02:40.590> out<00:02:40.799> of<00:02:40.980> those<00:02:41.100> truffles<00:02:41.370> first<00:02:42.120> one

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
we dig out of those truffles first one

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.020 
we dig out of those truffles first one
you<00:02:42.450> got<00:02:42.600> to<00:02:42.720> know<00:02:42.840> why<00:02:43.109> we<00:02:43.430> what<00:02:44.430> they<00:02:44.609> are<00:02:44.760> and

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
you got to know why we what they are and

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.710 
you got to know why we what they are and
why<00:02:45.299> we<00:02:45.329> dig<00:02:45.690> them<00:02:45.900> up<00:02:45.930> now<00:02:46.849> on<00:02:47.849> a<00:02:48.030> simpler<00:02:48.480> case

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
why we dig them up now on a simpler case

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.559 
why we dig them up now on a simpler case
if<00:02:48.959> you<00:02:49.019> are<00:02:49.590> say<00:02:49.889> a<00:02:49.920> quarterback<00:02:50.670> over<00:02:51.299> here

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
if you are say a quarterback over here

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.569 
if you are say a quarterback over here
you<00:02:52.019> toss<00:02:52.290> the<00:02:52.530> football<00:02:52.680> um--<00:02:53.010> air<00:02:53.250> and<00:02:53.489> you

you toss the football um-- air and you

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:55.190 
you toss the football um-- air and you
have<00:02:53.760> a<00:02:53.790> receiver<00:02:54.269> here<00:02:54.599> or<00:02:54.690> try<00:02:54.810> to<00:02:54.900> catch<00:02:55.170> it

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
have a receiver here or try to catch it

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.789 
have a receiver here or try to catch it
the<00:02:56.010> distance<00:02:56.549> between<00:02:57.090> them<00:02:57.540> can<00:02:58.079> be<00:02:58.290> modeled

and that's the first example come to my

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:32.809 
and that's the first example come to my

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
into football right now all right

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.190 
into football right now all right
background<00:03:34.860> to<00:03:35.190> this<00:03:35.340> one<00:03:35.580> so<00:03:35.819> we<00:03:36.420> address<00:03:36.989> to

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
background to this one so we address to

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.559 
background to this one so we address to
what<00:03:37.440> the<00:03:37.590> roots<00:03:37.799> are<00:03:38.040> in<00:03:38.340> a<00:03:38.459> way<00:03:38.610> we<00:03:38.790> care<00:03:39.150> now

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
what the roots are in a way we care now

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:41.240 
what the roots are in a way we care now
let's<00:03:39.780> talk<00:03:39.959> about<00:03:40.019> how<00:03:40.500> we<00:03:40.560> dig<00:03:40.890> out<00:03:41.069> the

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
let's talk about how we dig out the

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.710 
let's talk about how we dig out the
roots<00:03:41.459> okay<00:03:42.120> so<00:03:42.180> we<00:03:42.540> have<00:03:42.810> a<00:03:44.030> function<00:03:45.030> here

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
roots okay so we have a function here

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.770 
roots okay so we have a function here
that's<00:03:45.989> a<00:03:46.140> polynomial<00:03:46.980> higher<00:03:47.370> than<00:03:48.269> second

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
that's a polynomial higher than second

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.009 
that's a polynomial higher than second
degree<00:03:48.930> so<00:03:49.380> we<00:03:49.530> cannot<00:03:50.120> use<00:03:51.120> quadratic

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
degree so we cannot use quadratic

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.220 
degree so we cannot use quadratic
formula<00:03:52.980> so<00:03:53.430> our<00:03:53.670> goal<00:03:53.970> here<00:03:54.299> as<00:03:54.510> I<00:03:54.540> alluded

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
formula so our goal here as I alluded

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.339 
formula so our goal here as I alluded
earlier<00:03:55.790> what<00:03:56.790> we<00:03:56.910> need<00:03:57.090> to<00:03:57.180> do<00:03:57.390> is<00:03:57.630> reduce

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
earlier what we need to do is reduce

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:06.280 
earlier what we need to do is reduce
this<00:03:58.920> one<00:03:59.250> by<00:03:59.730> factoring<00:04:00.329> it<00:04:04.099> so<00:04:05.099> we<00:04:05.400> have

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
this one by factoring it so we have

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.160 
this one by factoring it so we have
something<00:04:07.290> read<00:04:08.220> readiness<00:04:08.730> FX<00:04:09.209> you<00:04:09.959> could

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
something read readiness FX you could

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.559 
something read readiness FX you could
have<00:04:10.290> something<00:04:10.769> at<00:04:10.950> a<00:04:11.010> simple<00:04:11.549> one<00:04:11.730> times

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
have something at a simple one times

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:15.879 
have something at a simple one times
something<00:04:13.410> else<00:04:13.769> and<00:04:14.010> because<00:04:14.790> we<00:04:14.970> can<00:04:15.150> factor

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:15.889 
something else and because we can factor

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:19.940 
something else and because we can factor
reduce<00:04:16.889> degree<00:04:17.609> of<00:04:17.760> one<00:04:18.120> this<00:04:18.870> one<00:04:19.260> we're

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 
reduce degree of one this one we're

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.790 
reduce degree of one this one we're
going<00:04:20.070> to<00:04:20.130> degree<00:04:20.609> of<00:04:20.850> three<00:04:21.690> reduce<00:04:22.320> down<00:04:22.620> to

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
going to degree of three reduce down to

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.940 
going to degree of three reduce down to
the<00:04:22.979> quadratic<00:04:23.880> here<00:04:24.350> why<00:04:25.350> do<00:04:25.410> we<00:04:25.650> want<00:04:25.860> to

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
the quadratic here why do we want to

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.100 
the quadratic here why do we want to
reduce<00:04:26.340> to<00:04:26.610> a<00:04:26.820> quadratic<00:04:27.300> because<00:04:27.780> we<00:04:27.930> have

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
reduce to a quadratic because we have

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.800 
reduce to a quadratic because we have
quadratic<00:04:28.530> formula<00:04:29.360> then<00:04:30.360> we<00:04:30.450> can<00:04:30.630> use

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
quadratic formula then we can use

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.980 
quadratic formula then we can use
quadratic<00:04:31.110> formula<00:04:31.979> illness<00:04:32.370> okay<00:04:33.330> now<00:04:33.840> if

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
quadratic formula illness okay now if

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.200 
quadratic formula illness okay now if
you<00:04:34.169> have<00:04:34.350> a<00:04:34.380> fourth<00:04:34.860> power<00:04:35.310> here<00:04:35.760> you're

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
you have a fourth power here you're

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.969 
you have a fourth power here you're
going<00:04:36.360> to<00:04:36.419> have<00:04:36.600> to<00:04:36.750> redo<00:04:37.139> this<00:04:37.289> again<00:04:37.680> so

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 
going to have to redo this again so

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:41.000 
going to have to redo this again so
basically<00:04:38.460> going<00:04:38.729> to<00:04:38.789> have<00:04:39.030> factory<00:04:39.810> ones<00:04:40.200> get

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
basically going to have factory ones get

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.159 
basically going to have factory ones get
it<00:04:41.160> to<00:04:41.280> the<00:04:41.400> cube<00:04:41.729> let's<00:04:42.450> see<00:04:42.660> if<00:04:42.780> you<00:04:42.930> have<00:04:43.139> a

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
it to the cube let's see if you have a

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:46.370 
it to the cube let's see if you have a
fourth<00:04:43.889> power<00:04:44.190> here<00:04:44.669> then<00:04:45.240> you<00:04:45.450> factor<00:04:46.050> it

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
fourth power here then you factor it

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:50.900 
fourth power here then you factor it
once<00:04:47.270> reduce<00:04:48.270> down<00:04:48.570> to<00:04:48.810> a<00:04:49.080> cube<00:04:49.919> and<00:04:50.220> then

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
once reduce down to a cube and then

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.790 
once reduce down to a cube and then
factor<00:04:51.570> it<00:04:51.660> again<00:04:51.900> reduced<00:04:52.590> down<00:04:52.770> to

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
factor it again reduced down to

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.710 
factor it again reduced down to
quadratic<00:04:53.250> because<00:04:53.580> you<00:04:53.700> go<00:04:54.000> is<00:04:54.270> always

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
quadratic because you go is always

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.350 
quadratic because you go is always
repeat<00:04:55.169> the<00:04:55.349> process<00:04:55.530> of<00:04:56.010> factoring<00:04:56.550> until

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
repeat the process of factoring until

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.330 
repeat the process of factoring until
you<00:04:57.479> end<00:04:57.660> up<00:04:57.810> with<00:04:57.960> a<00:04:58.020> quadratic<00:04:58.500> with<00:04:59.130> some

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
you end up with a quadratic with some

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.320 
you end up with a quadratic with some
factors<00:04:59.849> and<00:05:00.120> why<00:05:00.630> do<00:05:00.690> we<00:05:00.870> use<00:05:01.200> quadratic

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
factors and why do we use quadratic

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.730 
factors and why do we use quadratic
because<00:05:03.330> we<00:05:03.510> have<00:05:03.660> a<00:05:03.690> quadratic<00:05:03.870> formula<00:05:04.620> we

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
because we have a quadratic formula we

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.430 
because we have a quadratic formula we
can<00:05:04.889> use<00:05:05.130> quadratic<00:05:05.400> formula<00:05:06.330> to<00:05:06.990> actually

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
can use quadratic formula to actually

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.950 
can use quadratic formula to actually
find<00:05:08.099> the

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
find the

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.450 
find the
it's<00:05:09.199> over<00:05:09.770> here<00:05:10.039> ok<00:05:10.610> so<00:05:11.560> the<00:05:12.560> in<00:05:12.650> the<00:05:12.740> next<00:05:13.100> few

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
it's over here ok so the in the next few

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.309 
it's over here ok so the in the next few
minutes<00:05:13.669> let's<00:05:14.030> get<00:05:14.240> started<00:05:14.690> solving<00:05:15.020> this

can<00:06:44.580> reduce<00:06:44.940> number<00:06:45.210> of<00:06:45.510> solution<00:06:46.050> you<00:06:46.110> have

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:46.260 
can reduce number of solution you have

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.350 
can reduce number of solution you have
to<00:06:46.380> look<00:06:46.530> for<00:06:46.830> into<00:06:47.520> a<00:06:47.550> set<00:06:48.420> number<00:06:48.630> of

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:50.360 
to look for into a set number of

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.450 
to look for into a set number of
solutions<00:06:51.360> okay<00:06:52.080> so<00:06:52.170> this<00:06:52.440> P<00:06:52.740> Q<00:06:52.980> theorem<00:06:53.340> is

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:53.460 
solutions okay so this P Q theorem is

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:56.150 
solutions okay so this P Q theorem is
the<00:06:53.640> first<00:06:53.880> two<00:06:54.210> we<00:06:54.420> need<00:06:54.630> the<00:06:55.170> peculiar<00:06:55.590> mez

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:56.160 
the first two we need the peculiar mez

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.330 
the first two we need the peculiar mez
basically<00:06:57.120> grab<00:06:58.080> the<00:06:58.230> coefficient<00:06:58.860> here<00:06:59.010> grab

00:06:59.330 --> 00:06:59.340 
basically grab the coefficient here grab

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.520 
basically grab the coefficient here grab
the<00:06:59.490> coefficient<00:07:00.150> here<00:07:00.420> and<00:07:00.630> through<00:07:01.260> the

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:01.530 
the coefficient here and through the

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:04.220 
the coefficient here and through the
some<00:07:02.190> manipulation<00:07:03.060> between<00:07:03.510> this<00:07:03.690> and<00:07:03.750> this

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:04.230 
some manipulation between this and this

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:06.830 
some manipulation between this and this
we<00:07:04.740> can<00:07:04.950> actually<00:07:05.130> guess<00:07:05.610> where<00:07:06.180> the<00:07:06.300> possible

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:06.840 
we can actually guess where the possible

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:08.900 
we can actually guess where the possible
routes<00:07:06.990> are<00:07:07.230> okay<00:07:07.770> this<00:07:08.070> is<00:07:08.220> where<00:07:08.460> we'll<00:07:08.670> pick

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:08.910 
routes are okay this is where we'll pick

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:11.600 
routes are okay this is where we'll pick
up<00:07:08.940> on<00:07:09.240> the<00:07:09.660> second<00:07:10.050> portion<00:07:10.260> of<00:07:10.560> this<00:07:10.770> video's

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:11.610 
up on the second portion of this video's

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:14.660 
up on the second portion of this video's
theory<00:07:11.910> all<00:07:12.480> right
