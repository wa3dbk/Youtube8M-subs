in<00:00:08.069> this<00:00:08.220> video<00:00:08.610> we'll<00:00:09.420> look<00:00:09.450> at<00:00:09.719> how<00:00:09.929> throw<00:00:10.620> a

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:10.910 
in this video we'll look at how throw a

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.180 
in this video we'll look at how throw a
straight<00:00:11.910> right<00:00:12.150> off<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.840> jab<00:00:13.080> so<00:00:14.070> in<00:00:14.130> the

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
straight right off the jab so in the

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.980 
straight right off the jab so in the
previous<00:00:14.400> video<00:00:14.730> we<00:00:14.969> looked<00:00:15.330> at<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.509> approach

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
previous video we looked at the approach

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.370 
previous video we looked at the approach
or<00:00:16.379> safety<00:00:16.680> check<00:00:17.039> I<00:00:17.539> hid<00:00:18.539> behind<00:00:18.570> my<00:00:18.930> shoulder

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
or safety check I hid behind my shoulder

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.929 
or safety check I hid behind my shoulder
and<00:00:20.039> I<00:00:20.430> I<00:00:21.410> entered<00:00:22.410> in<00:00:22.680> that<00:00:22.830> 45<00:00:23.160> degree<00:00:23.580> angle

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
and I I entered in that 45 degree angle

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.720 
and I I entered in that 45 degree angle
and<00:00:24.090> I<00:00:24.269> leave<00:00:25.019> in<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.320> same<00:00:25.529> angle<00:00:25.859> so<00:00:26.070> I<00:00:26.310> make

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
and I leave in the same angle so I make

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.160 
and I leave in the same angle so I make
it<00:00:26.760> really<00:00:27.269> hard<00:00:27.449> for<00:00:27.599> my<00:00:27.720> opponent<00:00:28.109> to

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
it really hard for my opponent to

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.089 
it really hard for my opponent to
counter<00:00:28.789> so<00:00:30.019> what<00:00:31.019> we<00:00:31.109> look<00:00:31.260> at<00:00:31.380> in<00:00:31.529> this<00:00:31.920> video

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
counter so what we look at in this video

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.610 
counter so what we look at in this video
is<00:00:32.279> how<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.700> set<00:00:33.030> up<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.480> straight<00:00:34.170> right<00:00:34.350> hand

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
is how to set up the straight right hand

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.049 
is how to set up the straight right hand
off<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.520> game<00:00:36.149> so<00:00:37.020> basically<00:00:37.850> what<00:00:38.850> my

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
off that game so basically what my

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.380 
off that game so basically what my
safety<00:00:39.840> check<00:00:40.050> does<00:00:40.320> is<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:41.520> creates<00:00:41.730> an<00:00:42.059> angle

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
safety check does is it creates an angle

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.549 
safety check does is it creates an angle
so<00:00:42.719> for<00:00:43.110> split<00:00:43.530> second<00:00:43.950> even<00:00:44.309> be<00:00:44.489> square<00:00:45.559> so

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
so for split second even be square so

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.619 
so for split second even be square so
basically<00:00:47.250> my<00:00:47.460> keyboard<00:00:47.910> takes<00:00:48.149> me<00:00:48.300> 45

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
basically my keyboard takes me 45

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.520 
basically my keyboard takes me 45
degrees<00:00:49.079> this<00:00:49.260> way<00:00:49.670> so<00:00:50.670> I'm<00:00:51.390> gonna<00:00:51.870> in<00:00:52.350> a

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
degrees this way so I'm gonna in a

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.340 
degrees this way so I'm gonna in a
position<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.940> throw<00:00:54.149> my<00:00:54.329> right<00:00:54.539> knee<00:00:54.780> right

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
position to throw my right knee right

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.000 
position to throw my right knee right
between<00:00:55.620> his<00:00:56.129> hands<00:00:57.090> so<00:00:57.960> most<00:00:58.170> people<00:00:58.379> when

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
between his hands so most people when

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.660 
between his hands so most people when
they<00:00:59.160> send<00:00:59.460> in<00:00:59.640> their<00:00:59.670> final<00:01:00.180> stand<00:01:01.670> facing

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
they send in their final stand facing

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.880 
they send in their final stand facing
their<00:01:03.030> opponent<00:01:03.510> they're<00:01:04.350> pretty<00:01:04.680> well

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
their opponent they're pretty well

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.280 
their opponent they're pretty well
closed<00:01:05.790> off<00:01:06.090> if<00:01:06.390> they<00:01:06.810> know<00:01:06.990> what<00:01:07.170> they're

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
closed off if they know what they're

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.480 
closed off if they know what they're
doing<00:01:07.590> you're<00:01:07.710> not<00:01:07.740> gonna<00:01:08.040> be<00:01:08.130> able<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.369> just

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
doing you're not gonna be able to just

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.070 
doing you're not gonna be able to just
throw<00:01:08.729> your<00:01:09.030> right<00:01:09.180> hand<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.689> connect<00:01:09.930> with

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
throw your right hand and connect with

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.530 
throw your right hand and connect with
that<00:01:10.229> head<00:01:10.640> they're<00:01:11.640> gonna<00:01:11.729> have<00:01:11.939> their<00:01:12.090> their

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
that head they're gonna have their their

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.800 
that head they're gonna have their their
gloves<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.260> way<00:01:14.030> so<00:01:15.030> what<00:01:15.360> we<00:01:15.450> want<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.689> do

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
gloves and the way so what we want to do

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.649 
gloves and the way so what we want to do
here<00:01:16.110> is<00:01:16.259> is<00:01:16.650> move<00:01:16.979> off<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.189> an<00:01:17.460> angle<00:01:17.580> so<00:01:18.450> we're

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
here is is move off to an angle so we're

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.420 
here is is move off to an angle so we're
effectively<00:01:19.229> creating<00:01:19.680> like<00:01:19.860> this<00:01:20.100> kind<00:01:20.400> of

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
effectively creating like this kind of

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.700 
effectively creating like this kind of
angle<00:01:20.759> so<00:01:21.330> there's<00:01:21.540> lots<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:21.990> space<00:01:22.140> for<00:01:22.619> the

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
angle so there's lots of space for the

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.850 
angle so there's lots of space for the
right<00:01:22.860> hand<00:01:23.100> tool<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.610> go<00:01:23.820> through<00:01:24.259> so<00:01:25.259> if<00:01:25.680> you

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
right hand tool to go through so if you

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.890 
right hand tool to go through so if you
throw<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.159> jab<00:01:26.820> like<00:01:27.090> we<00:01:27.330> did<00:01:27.720> in<00:01:27.840> the

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
throw the jab like we did in the

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.450 
throw the jab like we did in the
previous<00:01:28.020> video<00:01:28.409> it's<00:01:28.799> gonna<00:01:28.860> take<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:29.310> up<00:01:29.430> to

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
previous video it's gonna take you up to

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.420 
previous video it's gonna take you up to
this<00:01:30.180> angle<00:01:30.420> like<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.380> mentioned<00:01:31.829> before<00:01:31.860> I

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
this angle like I mentioned before I

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.429 
this angle like I mentioned before I
want<00:01:32.939> my<00:01:33.090> back<00:01:33.270> foot<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.750> be<00:01:33.900> flat<00:01:34.170> on<00:01:34.350> the

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
ground so that means I have a lot of

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.140 
ground so that means I have a lot of
power<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:37.979> lot<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.189> distance<00:01:38.670> in<00:01:38.820> my<00:01:38.939> right

to kind of pull my my jab back and with

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:45.290 
to kind of pull my my jab back and with
my

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300

my
my<00:01:45.450> hips<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.170> my<00:01:46.290> legs<00:01:46.770> I've<00:01:47.430> got<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.640> drawing

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
my hips and my legs I've got a drawing

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.150 
my hips and my legs I've got a drawing
right<00:01:48.330> hand<00:01:48.570> forward<00:01:48.810> here<00:01:49.080> to<00:01:49.530> straight<00:01:49.950> down

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 
right hand forward here to straight down

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.700 
right hand forward here to straight down
the<00:01:50.310> pipe<00:01:50.520> connecting<00:01:51.120> on<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:51.330> chin<00:01:51.710> pulling

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
the pipe connecting on the chin pulling

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.640 
the pipe connecting on the chin pulling
it<00:01:52.800> back<00:01:53.010> and<00:01:53.220> go<00:01:53.850> out<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.210> same<00:01:54.390> direction<00:01:54.720> so

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
it back and go out the same direction so

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.590 
it back and go out the same direction so
usually<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.250> set<00:01:56.490> this<00:01:56.670> up<00:01:56.850> by<00:01:57.090> throwing<00:01:57.390> a

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
usually you set this up by throwing a

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.290 
usually you set this up by throwing a
couple<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:57.960> jabs<00:01:58.200> alone<00:01:58.760> so<00:01:59.760> like<00:01:59.970> we<00:02:00.090> talked

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
couple of jabs alone so like we talked

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.180 
couple of jabs alone so like we talked
about<00:02:00.330> before<00:02:00.750> we're<00:02:01.440> gonna<00:02:01.560> get<00:02:01.830> and<00:02:02.100> I'm

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
about before we're gonna get and I'm

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.290

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
one that you do this broken rhythm thing

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.040 
one that you do this broken rhythm thing
where<00:02:32.700> you<00:02:32.760> just<00:02:32.790> kind<00:02:33.180> of<00:02:33.240> stick<00:02:33.510> the<00:02:33.660> jab<00:02:33.690> out

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
where you just kind of stick the jab out

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.960 
where you just kind of stick the jab out
there<00:02:34.260> immediately<00:02:34.860> when<00:02:35.310> this<00:02:35.490> is<00:02:35.610> full<00:02:35.760> and

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
there immediately when this is full and

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.240 
there immediately when this is full and
I'm<00:02:36.810> gonna<00:02:37.050> start<00:02:37.320> throwing<00:02:37.500> my<00:02:37.800> right<00:02:37.980> hand

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
that's gonna make it very hard to

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.710 
that's gonna make it very hard to
anticipate<00:02:41.040> what's<00:02:42.000> happening

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
anticipate what's happening

if you're going to rhythm like this it's

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.949 
if you're going to rhythm like this it's
much<00:02:49.560> easier<00:02:50.130> for<00:02:50.190> him<00:02:50.520> to<00:02:51.239> read<00:02:51.540> what<00:02:51.810> you're

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
much easier for him to read what you're

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.080 
much easier for him to read what you're
doing<00:02:52.230> if<00:02:52.530> you<00:02:52.830> effectively<00:02:53.310> Telegraph<00:02:53.910> in

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
doing if you effectively Telegraph in

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.180 
doing if you effectively Telegraph in
your<00:02:54.209> combination<00:02:54.810> so<00:02:55.590> what<00:02:55.770> you<00:02:55.860> want<00:02:56.010> to<00:02:56.040> do

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
your combination so what you want to do

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.770 
your combination so what you want to do
is<00:02:56.340> create<00:02:56.700> it's<00:02:56.880> kind<00:02:57.090> of<00:02:57.120> broken<00:02:57.300> rhythm

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
is create it's kind of broken rhythm

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.540 
is create it's kind of broken rhythm
it's<00:02:58.380> gonna<00:02:58.470> make<00:02:58.680> it<00:02:58.709> a<00:02:58.800> lot<00:02:58.920> harder<00:02:59.160> for<00:02:59.310> him

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
it's gonna make it a lot harder for him

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.820 
it's gonna make it a lot harder for him
and<00:02:59.820> maybe<00:03:00.000> easier<00:03:00.300> for<00:03:00.480> you<00:03:00.540> connect<00:03:00.900> make

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830
