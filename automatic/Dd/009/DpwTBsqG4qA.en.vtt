00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:18.550 
all right by popular demand a test of

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.300 
all right by popular demand a test of
the<00:00:18.760> KMTV

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
the KMTV

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.190 
the KMTV
7,500<00:00:21.310> got<00:00:21.700> a<00:00:21.730> GoPro<00:00:21.939> here<00:00:22.450> too<00:00:22.660> so<00:00:22.900> you<00:00:22.990> can

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:23.200 
7,500 got a GoPro here too so you can

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.530 
7,500 got a GoPro here too so you can
see<00:00:23.380> the<00:00:23.529> action<00:00:24.070> here<00:00:24.369> and<00:00:25.150> then<00:00:25.270> I've<00:00:25.390> also

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:25.540 
see the action here and then I've also

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:30.290 
see the action here and then I've also
got<00:00:25.689> the<00:00:26.020> Lumix<00:00:27.149> gh4<00:00:28.149> camera<00:00:28.989> ready<00:00:29.710> to<00:00:29.950> go

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
got the Lumix gh4 camera ready to go

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.400 
got the Lumix gh4 camera ready to go
it's<00:00:31.300> already<00:00:31.570> recording<00:00:31.989> enter<00:00:32.110> so<00:00:32.259> just

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
it's already recording enter so just

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:33.960 
it's already recording enter so just
going<00:00:32.529> to<00:00:32.590> switch<00:00:32.800> this<00:00:32.980> on<00:00:33.220> and<00:00:33.550> you<00:00:33.850> can

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:33.970 
going to switch this on and you can

00:00:33.970 --> 00:01:16.550 
going to switch this on and you can
check<00:00:34.059> it<00:00:34.210> out

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.950 

I<00:01:16.649> have<00:01:17.310> done<00:01:17.579> minor<00:01:17.939> calibration<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.840> this

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
I have done minor calibration to this

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.340 
I have done minor calibration to this
but<00:01:19.290> very<00:01:19.950> little<00:01:20.479> just<00:01:21.479> kind<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:21.899> the<00:01:22.079> the

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
but very little just kind of the the

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.469 
but very little just kind of the the
real<00:01:22.619> simple<00:01:23.040> calibration<00:01:23.490> there's<00:01:24.299> some

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
real simple calibration there's some

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.630 
real simple calibration there's some
more<00:01:24.799> in-depth<00:01:25.799> calibration<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.520> can

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
more in-depth calibration that you can

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.800 
more in-depth calibration that you can
get<00:01:26.759> into<00:01:27.000> with<00:01:27.149> the<00:01:27.210> software<00:01:27.570> as<00:01:27.869> well<00:01:28.170> as

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
get into with the software as well as

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.320 
get into with the software as well as
you<00:01:30.810> know<00:01:30.930> balancing<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.649> that's<00:01:32.220> crucial<00:01:32.789> and

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
you know balancing it that's crucial and

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:48.460 
you know balancing it that's crucial and
as<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:33.570> can<00:01:33.659> see<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.990> performs<00:01:34.770> quite<00:01:34.950> well

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.050

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
so yeah there it is

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.430 
so yeah there it is
KMTV<00:01:52.310> 7500<00:01:53.310> it's<00:01:54.000> about<00:01:54.090> 1,300<00:01:54.480> bucks<00:01:54.870> fully

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
KMTV 7500 it's about 1,300 bucks fully

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.150 
KMTV 7500 it's about 1,300 bucks fully
assembled<00:01:56.040> ready<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.820> go<00:01:57.380> you<00:01:58.380> know<00:01:58.500> minor

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.160 
assembled ready to go you know minor

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.810 
assembled ready to go you know minor
minor<00:01:59.760> assembly<00:02:00.290> minor<00:02:01.290> calibrations<00:02:02.100> so<00:02:02.460> far

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
minor assembly minor calibrations so far

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.930 
minor assembly minor calibrations so far
so<00:02:03.210> we'll<00:02:03.330> see<00:02:03.570> if<00:02:03.800> you<00:02:04.800> know<00:02:04.920> kind<00:02:05.580> of<00:02:05.670> how<00:02:05.790> it

so we'll see if you know kind of how it

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.450 
so we'll see if you know kind of how it
proves<00:02:06.180> in<00:02:06.360> a<00:02:06.450> professional<00:02:06.930> setting<00:02:07.460> thanks

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
proves in a professional setting thanks

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:20.430 
proves in a professional setting thanks
for<00:02:08.610> watching
