 happiness and good luck how often was this 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.120
 that leading on kill pretty 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.089
 decently did you notice that hero 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.070
 the enemy is 2 levels above you ready 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.320
 bet at the beginning it caused you 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.140
 bewilderment if not more for 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.869
 those who are still baffled by such 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:29.789
 situation and will this video with you fer 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:32.160
 zan and we start a little start on I wanted 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.040
 not with the inside match his experience with 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.440
 experience inside the game namely experience for 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.100
 account and experience for pumping individual 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.829
 characters 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.829
 where does this experience come from with this just 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.930
 everything is clear we play urine and by their 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.809
 the completion of the experience for the entire account 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.000
 and for the character that played how much 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.850
 we get the experience so much the same 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.719
 how many heroes did we get in the match plus 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.000
 50 thousand 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.000
 in case of victory, losing a match is not 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.460
 imposes penalties and experience come in 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.300
 full so it doesn't matter 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.700
 we won 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.070
 or lost we get the whole 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.080
 the experience earned by the team though 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.119
 the winner will get a small 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.070
 reward 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:16.439
 maximum account level 40 hero 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.170
 10 at hero level ten to us 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.290
 the opportunity to purchase 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.840
 masterful 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.030
 for ten thousand gold awards for 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.850
 account level look like 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:31.259
 way we see that one of the key 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.939
 levels is 15 reward same for level 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.579
 character let's break a little 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.130
 more when pumping character also 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.740
 there is a key level and this 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.990
 level 5 if upon receipt first 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.450
 four levels we get to know gradually 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.680
 with the character and make it full 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.439
 because only on the fourth level 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.930
 all talents and ultimatums are revealed 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:55.750
 abilities then level five gives us 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.030
 the reward is so necessary so valuable 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.280
 for us gold is further developed 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.289
 character happens only according to your 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.689
 personal desire as essentially except 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:07.000
 basic mount mount daskin colors nothing 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:09.849
 does not offer but to deflate the hero to 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.299
 Level 10 you will need a lot 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:16.900
 what time to say if abs 9 to 10 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:20.620
 level requires you to about 50 grams per 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:24.819
 one character totaling 38 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.610
 39 and 40 level account pumping a lot 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.540
 isn't it use of stimulants 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.720
 significantly speeds up 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.090
 and facilitate this process but let's 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.000
 move on to the inside urinary experience and to 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:40.209
 There are three sources of its receipt 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.190
 main and permanent sources of experience 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:46.810
 this is killing enemy heroes 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:49.239
 killing minions and exterminating denmark 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.639
 enemy fortifications as well 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.739
 additional source of camp experience 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:56.260
 mercenaries let's disassemble every 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.930
 source of separately killing heroes 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.260
 here everything is just killing the heroes we get 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.930
 the experience that goes into a common piggy bank 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.569
 the amount of experience depends on the level 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.739
 enemy hero and nothing else 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.109
 killing enemy minions 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:13.690
 although it would be more accurate to say death 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:15.940
 enemy minions near your hero 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.459
 the main thing is that they die in radius 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.340
 getting experience which is approximately equal 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:24.489
 hero review and no matter left attached 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.829
 hand to kill them or not interesting 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.690
 the fact that for a full barrel of mobs we 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:31.840
 get experience more than kill 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:34.510
 Hero up to level 4 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.030
 and the fact that the experience is going in total 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.440
 piggy bank is divided into all heroes allows 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.760
 do 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.920
 unreal for other moba games 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.109
 line-ups seeking 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.870
 significant numerical superiority 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:50.860
 for example on the map ghost mines can 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:53.090
 stand 14 on the line without losing experience 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.670
 destruction of the structure for each 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.010
 destroyed building you get experience 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.560
 over time the amount of experience per demolition 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.730
 buildings does not increase consequently 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.160
 early stages of the game 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:07.100
 kick out stand on the lines getting experience behind 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:09.830
 mobs and demolish and strengthen the enemy than 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:12.080
 lead the hunt for enemy heroes with growth 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:14.150
 level situation is changing and killing 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.880
 heroes becomes a priority 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.459
 but only in terms of earning experience because 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.370
 the goal of the game is to destroy the opponent's buildings 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:24.470
 they are killers and his team and last 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.930
 the source of experience is the bulk camps 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:29.840
 monsters for their sweep we get not 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.910
 time dependent amount of experience but 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.280
 considering the mechanics of the camps the enemies 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.500
 the enemy with their killing also get 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.000
 some experience in the end we get only 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:42.200
 temporary gain line 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.280
 which is also pretty good let's 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.470
 let's sum up 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.180
 to maximize the amount received 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.460
 experience at the beginning of the game 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.080
 preferably on all lines on 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.750
 map to at least fourth fourth 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.390
 level or until necessary 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.770
 fulfill the goals of the script your goal 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.510
 get level 10 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.090
 and at the same time ultimatum 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:05.750
 abilities before the opposing team 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:07.820
 to impose your game at the beginning of a match 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:10.730
 destruction of the structure gaining experience 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:13.460
 castle priority task closer to the final 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:15.770
 killing heroes becomes more profitable with 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.600
 In terms of experience, itâ€™s time 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.940
 cool team fights 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.410
 interactions 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:23.630
