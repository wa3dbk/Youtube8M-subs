contemplated on getting a new hair dryer

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.770 
contemplated on getting a new hair dryer
because<00:00:06.690> it<00:00:07.319> was<00:00:08.040> taking<00:00:08.429> so<00:00:08.460> long<00:00:08.910> to<00:00:09.240> dry<00:00:09.630> my

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
because it was taking so long to dry my

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.390 
because it was taking so long to dry my

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
hair and I don't even have very thick

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.480 
hair and I don't even have very thick
hair<00:00:11.750> so<00:00:12.750> for<00:00:13.380> it<00:00:13.469> to<00:00:13.530> break<00:00:13.710> it<00:00:13.950> kind<00:00:14.160> of<00:00:14.250> felt

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
hair so for it to break it kind of felt

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.640 
hair so for it to break it kind of felt
like<00:00:14.549> fate<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.330> just<00:00:15.809> basically<00:00:15.929> would<00:00:16.410> not

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
like fate and just basically would not

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.580 
like fate and just basically would not
even<00:00:16.859> turn<00:00:17.190> on<00:00:17.220> I've<00:00:17.670> had<00:00:17.940> I<00:00:18.420> think<00:00:19.140> four

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
even turn on I've had I think four

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.710 
even turn on I've had I think four
different<00:00:19.859> hair<00:00:20.010> dryers<00:00:20.279> in<00:00:20.640> like<00:00:21.510> my

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
different hair dryers in like my

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.590 
different hair dryers in like my
lifetime<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:22.650> all<00:00:23.250> of<00:00:23.460> them<00:00:23.609> have<00:00:23.640> broken<00:00:24.029> and

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
lifetime and all of them have broken and

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.029 
lifetime and all of them have broken and
I<00:00:24.779> think<00:00:24.930> it's<00:00:25.019> probably<00:00:25.170> just<00:00:25.380> because<00:00:25.439> i<00:00:25.650> buy

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
I think it's probably just because i buy

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.710 
I think it's probably just because i buy
them<00:00:26.310> from<00:00:26.670> like<00:00:26.939> I<00:00:27.060> had<00:00:27.150> always<00:00:27.300> bought<00:00:27.570> them

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
for a couple of weeks now so I'm going

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.990 
for a couple of weeks now so I'm going
to<00:01:49.350> try<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.590> pronounce<00:01:49.799> this<00:01:50.130> correctly<00:01:50.700> and

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
to try to pronounce this correctly and

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.749 
to try to pronounce this correctly and
this<00:01:51.390> is<00:01:51.600> their<00:01:51.869> volis<00:01:52.409> a<00:01:52.680> line<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.340> that's

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
this is their volis a line and that's

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.940 
this is their volis a line and that's
Italian<00:01:54.329> for<00:01:54.360> fast<00:01:54.899> so<00:01:55.170> I'm<00:01:55.409> not<00:01:55.619> taken

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950

Italian<00:01:56.369> so<00:01:56.549> I'm<00:01:56.640> hoping<00:01:56.939> that<00:01:57.000> I'm

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
Italian so I'm hoping that I'm

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.990

pronouncing<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:57.689> correctly<00:01:58.070> um<00:01:59.070> but<00:01:59.460> this

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
pronouncing that correctly um but this

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.219 
pronouncing that correctly um but this
is<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.659> turbo<00:02:01.380> line<00:02:02.040> hair<00:02:02.670> dryer<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.140> there's<00:02:04.140> a

quicker than a normal hair dryer the
aunt<00:03:23.449> ionic<00:03:23.989> on<00:03:24.109> here<00:03:24.319> it<00:03:24.409> says<00:03:24.560> it<00:03:24.769> breaks

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
aunt ionic on here it says it breaks

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.309 
aunt ionic on here it says it breaks
down<00:03:25.129> water<00:03:25.579> molecules<00:03:26.150> to<00:03:26.389> help<00:03:26.569> retain

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319 
down water molecules to help retain

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:31.119 
down water molecules to help retain
moisture<00:03:27.349> so<00:03:28.010> that<00:03:28.750> also<00:03:29.750> is<00:03:29.959> a<00:03:29.989> reason<00:03:30.290> why<00:03:30.409> so

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:31.129 
moisture so that also is a reason why so

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:33.670 
moisture so that also is a reason why so
I<00:03:31.209> knew<00:03:32.209> that<00:03:32.239> it<00:03:32.480> was<00:03:32.569> helped<00:03:33.319> to<00:03:33.349> dry<00:03:33.560> your

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
I knew that it was helped to dry your

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.050 
I knew that it was helped to dry your
hair<00:03:33.799> quicker<00:03:34.010> but<00:03:34.250> I<00:03:34.340> didn't<00:03:34.579> really<00:03:34.669> realize

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
hair quicker but I didn't really realize

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.059 
hair quicker but I didn't really realize
why<00:03:35.569> so<00:03:36.169> it<00:03:36.319> breaks<00:03:36.530> down<00:03:36.709> the<00:03:36.919> water

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 
why so it breaks down the water

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:39.099 
why so it breaks down the water
molecules<00:03:37.549> on<00:03:37.729> your<00:03:37.909> hair<00:03:38.150> and<00:03:38.359> that<00:03:38.840> kind<00:03:39.079> of

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:39.109 
molecules on your hair and that kind of

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:41.680 
molecules on your hair and that kind of
helps<00:03:39.560> to<00:03:39.829> dry<00:03:40.549> your<00:03:40.669> hair<00:03:40.849> quicker<00:03:41.090> as<00:03:41.479> well

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:43.609 
as retain moisture which is good for me

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:46.149 
as retain moisture which is good for me

00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:46.159 
because since I do have very dry like

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:50.199 
because since I do have very dry like
hair<00:03:47.319> it's<00:03:48.319> nice<00:03:48.620> to<00:03:48.889> have<00:03:49.069> a<00:03:49.129> hair<00:03:49.489> dryer<00:03:49.760> that

hair it's nice to have a hair dryer that

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:54.339 
hair it's nice to have a hair dryer that
will<00:03:50.780> help<00:03:51.199> to<00:03:51.470> keep<00:03:51.500> the<00:03:52.629> moisture<00:03:53.629> in<00:03:54.019> it<00:03:54.049> and

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:54.349 
will help to keep the moisture in it and

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:56.409 
will help to keep the moisture in it and
then<00:03:54.500> the<00:03:54.590> ceramic<00:03:54.949> helps<00:03:55.220> to<00:03:55.340> seal<00:03:55.549> the<00:03:56.239> hair

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:56.419 
then the ceramic helps to seal the hair

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:58.599 
then the ceramic helps to seal the hair
cuticle<00:03:56.599> first<00:03:57.019> shiny<00:03:57.290> and<00:03:57.500> smooth<00:03:57.829> finish<00:03:58.129> so

00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:58.609 
cuticle first shiny and smooth finish so

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:00.460 
cuticle first shiny and smooth finish so
the<00:03:58.729> other<00:03:58.849> two<00:03:59.150> like<00:03:59.569> things<00:03:59.870> about<00:04:00.290> this

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
hair dryer is it has a two-speed heat

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.860 
hair dryer is it has a two-speed heat
setting<00:04:04.639> and<00:04:05.389> it<00:04:05.540> provides<00:04:06.340> stability<00:04:07.870> and

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
setting and it provides stability and

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.839 
setting and it provides stability and
versatility<00:04:09.319> and<00:04:09.769> it<00:04:10.159> create<00:04:10.459> and<00:04:10.760> then

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849 
versatility and it create and then

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:12.729 
versatility and it create and then
there's<00:04:11.000> a<00:04:11.090> cool<00:04:11.269> shot<00:04:11.569> that<00:04:11.989> has<00:04:12.169> effective

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
there's a cool shot that has effective

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.120 
there's a cool shot that has effective
cool<00:04:13.040> styling<00:04:13.519> and<00:04:13.669> smooth

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.640 

so<00:04:16.700> long<00:04:16.910> cord<00:04:17.330> it<00:04:17.570> has<00:04:17.720> like<00:04:17.989> a<00:04:18.020> hang<00:04:18.350> thing

so long cord it has like a hang thing

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.050 
so long cord it has like a hang thing
these<00:04:18.920> are<00:04:19.070> all<00:04:19.160> like<00:04:19.370> the<00:04:19.489> little<00:04:19.700> features

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
these are all like the little features

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.210 
these are all like the little features

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:24.980 
wasn't too having in to take up too much

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.890 
wasn't too having in to take up too much
space<00:04:25.130> this<00:04:26.060> one<00:04:26.330> is<00:04:27.070> 15.2<00:04:28.070> ounces<00:04:28.510> so<00:04:29.510> it<00:04:29.750> is

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
space this one is 15.2 ounces so it is

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.450 
space this one is 15.2 ounces so it is
like<00:04:30.110> a<00:04:30.140> it<00:04:30.680> says<00:04:31.280> 4<00:04:31.610> 430<00:04:32.360> grams<00:04:32.660> ways<00:04:33.460> waste

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
like a it says 4 430 grams ways waste

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.280 
like a it says 4 430 grams ways waste
takes<00:04:34.880> the<00:04:35.060> hassle<00:04:35.240> out<00:04:35.540> of<00:04:35.600> the<00:04:35.810> hair<00:04:35.990> drying

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
routine so that's just a little bit of

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.520 
routine so that's just a little bit of
the<00:04:38.870> technology<00:04:39.530> piece<00:04:39.710> around<00:04:40.040> it<00:04:40.280> and<00:04:40.490> so

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
the technology piece around it and so

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.580 
the technology piece around it and so
after<00:04:42.530> using<00:04:43.220> it<00:04:43.430> for<00:04:43.700> a<00:04:43.730> couple<00:04:43.820> of<00:04:44.000> weeks<00:04:44.270> I

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590

which<00:04:58.220> this<00:04:58.370> one<00:04:58.430> does<00:04:58.580> not<00:04:58.880> have<00:04:59.150> the<00:04:59.390> feature

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
which this one does not have the feature

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:04.240 
which this one does not have the feature
is<00:05:00.500> that<00:05:00.560> they<00:05:01.390> like<00:05:02.620> oiled<00:05:03.620> and<00:05:03.770> retained<00:05:04.070> in

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
is that they like oiled and retained in

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:05.620

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:00.380 
like a lot of times there would be like

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.190 
like a lot of times there would be like
like<00:06:01.370> fuzziness<00:06:01.940> and<00:06:02.210> like<00:06:02.330> it<00:06:02.510> would<00:06:02.600> break<00:06:02.900> a

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:03.200

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.980 
like fuzziness and like it would break a
lot<00:06:03.710> so<00:06:04.340> this<00:06:04.820> one<00:06:05.030> I'm<00:06:05.150> notice<00:06:05.510> after<00:06:05.690> using

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990 
lot so this one I'm notice after using

lot so this one I'm notice after using
it<00:06:06.110> for<00:06:06.290> a<00:06:06.350> couple<00:06:06.440> of<00:06:06.620> weeks<00:06:06.680> my<00:06:07.040> hair<00:06:07.250> doesn't

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:07.430 
it for a couple of weeks my hair doesn't

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.250 
it for a couple of weeks my hair doesn't
seem<00:06:07.700> nearly<00:06:07.880> as<00:06:08.090> damaged<00:06:08.720> as<00:06:08.900> it<00:06:09.080> was

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:09.260 
seem nearly as damaged as it was

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.440 
seem nearly as damaged as it was
previously<00:06:09.620> so<00:06:10.370> I<00:06:10.580> definitely<00:06:11.240> would

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:11.450 
previously so I definitely would

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.300 
previously so I definitely would
recommend<00:06:11.480> it<00:06:12.020> is<00:06:12.350> a<00:06:12.380> more<00:06:12.680> expensive<00:06:12.980> hair

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:13.310 
recommend it is a more expensive hair

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:14.830 
recommend it is a more expensive hair
dryer<00:06:13.580> and<00:06:13.610> the<00:06:13.880> reason<00:06:14.090> I<00:06:14.150> did<00:06:14.330> purchase<00:06:14.540> it

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:14.840

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:18.520 
dryer and the reason I did purchase it
again<00:06:15.140> was<00:06:15.620> because<00:06:16.040> one<00:06:16.490> I<00:06:16.760> like<00:06:17.470> needed<00:06:18.470> a
