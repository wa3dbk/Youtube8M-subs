00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 Hi, how are you all good? 

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:06.990
 Welcome to your home welcome to 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.730
 android for all as I like the 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.860
 first impressions the first feeling 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.900
 It's love at first sight 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.550
 furtive look that one day will be the 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.690
 this protagonist had the opportunity to 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.690
 go to london to see a chinese 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:25.460
 first impressions 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:37.550
 well let's go there we started carlos with 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.760
 these first impressions we get to 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.230
 london we arrived at the presentation of a 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.000
 terminal that had already been presented in 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.800
 china but that was presented in society 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.050
 in europe and the first thing we saw 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.659
 It caught his attention was his physical appearance 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.339
 since at least from my opinion I have 

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:53.479
 an important leap forward regarding the 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:55.610
 11 no doubt I think we should highlight 

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:57.019
 two things on the one hand what it says is 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.670
 of 16 from here we invite you to 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:00.559
 take a look if you want to the terminal 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.809
 from which a radical change in 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:05.089
 materials in design and the second hue 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.380
 you know the huawei 1.007 it is 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.119
 practically the same but smaller 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.340
 it's really something like that, I think it has 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.960
 adopted I 'm going to tell you that I think of 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.090
 the best things we 've seen in the 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.920
 main 7 and the best things that we have 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.380
 seen in pe 8 and they have put it together in 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.210
 this honor 7 a terminal manufactured in 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.009
 aluminum that looks pretty premium 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.690
 feels very good at hand 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.550
 dimensions with measures and roads 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.440
 surprised despite the material that 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.880
 that builds it that was relatively 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.840
 maybe also your especially today 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.759
 we will talk about the size of the screen 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.530
 but I like that then of ranges that 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.909
 do not be excessively large so 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.890
 That is why we are going to highlight the 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.390
 things that he sent I liked and that I did not 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.979
 asked for depth but without the thousand 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.600
 seven has the same fingerprint reader 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.190
 located in the same place back 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.200
 we always say that what I most 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.520
 like it's the front but hey 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.259
 is testing on my site for a long time 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.850
 time and if it's the same they work very 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.500
 well I totally agree I do not 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.360
 I could test in depth reader 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.610
 traces but I saw before me in front of my 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.950
 eyes as they used it several times 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.049
 pretty fast with your finger and so on and 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.060
 it did not have any problem besides highlighting 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:04.130
 important to differentiate this sensor from 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.160
 traces in addition to having more utilities 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.450
 through the software they have added 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.459
 functionalities we can use it then 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.900
 with a mini trackpad to answer 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.370
 calls and so on 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.519
 when they follow us terminal and we can 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.630
 Try out exactly other functionalities 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:19.010
 we will tell you everything that we are going to 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.060
 also lift a little bit and it's a 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.110
 which has given you a lot of attention 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.280
 because it's not too usual 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.800
 find him 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.110
 we have a multifunction physical button 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.090
 we will be able to personalize the world and 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.310
 grams hears a pulsation that activates 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.569
 the camera two pulsations that 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.430
 turn on the flashlight 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.989
 make a screenshot seem 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.489
 little pranks but like a little the alert 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.200
 slider are not small functionalities 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.939
 who totally like it I'm 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.920
 super agree and I loved this 

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:45.139
 good function we saw that we had 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.239
 seen as things like jaume and projects 

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:49.430
 kickstarter to take advantage of a 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.620
 button using the 3 millimeter chat 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.420
 and medium but this time good 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.670
 have it directly from the factory in a 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.010
 well placed place that is pressed well 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.450
 to me I liked very much by 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.889
 of the 27 and one of the most 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.389
 coolies says our term come 

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:04.040
 let's jump a little bit already processed it 

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:05.450
 on the outside we go inside to see a 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.709
 little of the hardware it carries carries a 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.370
 kit processor and it can not be another 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:12.290
 way specifically 935 chords 64 bits 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.909
 they accompany you 3 gigas of ram flame 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.260
 we have a 16 gig version 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:17.060
 indeed we can also 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.639
 complement a little microsd cards is 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.739
 I do not remember badly up to 128 GB 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:23.480
 remember what people usually do 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.549
 or did not say there are many occasions have 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.139
 this dual sim that at the same time you can 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:29.329
 use one of the slots as a reader 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:31.280
 of micro sd that's fine but for another 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:33.409
 part that you know you can not have 26 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.389
 and the micro you see the whole battery 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:37.009
 important we have a capacity then 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:37.870
 quite hopeful we will see that being 

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:40.879
 he manages 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.709
 3100 milliamps important to highlight 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:44.510
 something that we always demand also in 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.459
 important fast load I think that to 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.349
 carlos here you consider me with a 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.390
 pretty similar value of the huawei p 8 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:52.099
 that we saw that it was a tiny bit 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.860
 battery level but growing up 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:56.480
 the 3.100 is something that I like a lot and 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.610
 a mode through which they have wanted 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.470
 take advantage of this amperage is being able 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.629
 load other terminals through a 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.400
 cable carlos de huerva you can do then 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:06.560
 using as word by sharing is 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.569
 live almost life share your gas 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.790
 can give doubt that and you will see it I think 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:13.099
 happens to you all the time give a small 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.659
 brushstroke to the software and in this case if 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:17.060
 we talk about one we get from huawei 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:21.350
 we talk about in a cool zoom in your 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:24.139
 version 3.1.1 as 5.1 not because it's the 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.479
 captures with 5.0 that convoluted to get 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:29.630
 to this joke if you've messed things up 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:31.430
 bad and 5.0 lollipop is the version that 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.410
 had installed at 17 we were 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.330
 testing with the museu there is a layer that 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:37.160
 and also we know that a good Eren 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.930
 cooked of little things in their cousins ​​of 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.689
 Huawei as I invented it in the face of 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:45.379
 camera like what the knuckle to do 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:46.789
 and well we already know we will try it on 

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:48.679
 depth has good things things 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:50.299
 bad but from here it looks like a 

00:04:48.679 --> 00:04:51.559
 what are the first ones 

00:04:50.299 --> 00:04:53.149
 impressions let's see them also a 

00:04:51.559 --> 00:04:54.229
 little of the screen logically this 

00:04:53.149 --> 00:04:55.729
 kind of presentations we can not 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:57.049
 To inquire too much about the material is what 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:59.269
 it's just that you know that we 

00:04:57.049 --> 00:05:01.610
 we found with a screen of 5.2 

00:04:59.269 --> 00:05:03.619
 inches size I like technology 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.389
 ips and the resolution that you can expect 

00:05:03.619 --> 00:05:06.829
 full hd effectively also comes with 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:08.719
 gorilla glass the first impressions 

00:05:06.829 --> 00:05:10.629
 that you can have as Carlos says they are not 

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:12.979
 the best because I do not have the best 

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:14.419
 good conditions to experiment with 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.800
 the screen but the full sensations 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:18.199
 they were pretty good I'm pretty 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.419
 hopeful with the ips panel that mounts 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:21.769
 this 17th and be able to check as already 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:23.119
 did the previous assignment and quite 

00:05:21.769 --> 00:05:25.219
 well I had a pretty screen 

00:05:23.119 --> 00:05:26.959
 decent as decent was also the 

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:30.079
 camera on this occasion we have a sensor 

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:32.409
 20 megapixel coated by is 

00:05:30.079 --> 00:05:32.409
 fine 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:42.169
 we do a little bit of reflection and in 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:43.639
 the review we will do it in a very 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:46.009
 more conscientious in the section 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:47.629
 photographic is usually pretty good 

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:48.200
 so good when we have one 

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:50.090
 we see many 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:52.340
 and for the front camera here too 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:54.830
 the Chinese put a button of attention 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:57.170
 8 megapixels in fita m de by a little something 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:59.810
 one part of the event in which only 

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:02.000
 existed before the end from the 

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:04.160
 scenario and against more people would have been 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.760
 crazy and all the Chinese the good 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.380
 works 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.240
 the ruins not santiago between much 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:09.830
 bleeding clear the people wanted and it seemed 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.630
 it looked like it had a good wide-angle 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.070
 we'll see in the analysis already good 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:16.130
 to close these first printing 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:18.590
 from 17 say that the people of honor 

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:20.180
 he also commented to us change his and 

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:22.580
 start from which you can buy 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.800
 the products of honor in europe are 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:27.440
 called I saw badly and through this one and 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:29.390
 eat you will find the 17 to 350 euros 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.340
 although today has a discount 

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:33.950
 of 50 with which it remains for 300 of 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.750
 one that I think is quite scandalous and 

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:37.610
 Quite a bargain for many products 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:40.220
 then I want to stop with this kind of 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:42.830
 stores directly the manufacturer this 

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:44.150
 is very well with a guarantee for this 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:45.380
 because you can get a lot of action from 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.670
 china we discussed a lot of 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:47.960
 stores but nothing is comparable to 

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:49.670
 service that the manufacturer can give you 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.290
 as such and with the guarantee that this is 

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:53.030
 that I think is very successful I hope that 

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:54.710
 Many manufacturers give this step as 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:56.300
 says call for 300 payments 

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.620
 we will do but suddenly we do not 

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.060
 appears nothing looks very good 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.770
 true that summarizing that way I think it's a 

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:02.300
 good product I like the materials 

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:04.640
 of construction I like a button 

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:06.320
 configurable I liked the reader of 

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.790
 footprints and in general I think it's a 

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:09.620
 very cool product as always the 

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:11.810
 software is what generates me a little bit 

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.550
 more than uncertainty the battery I think that 

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:15.200
 our occasion fulfilled enough 

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:17.050
 accompanied by fast charging and I have 

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:19.910
 really want to try it 17 sincerely 

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:21.350
 quality-price promises to be very product 

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:22.970
 so nothing has been the first 

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:26.230
 sensations as we always hope that 

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:26.230
 soon the terminal can arrive 

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:38.740
 see you very soon
