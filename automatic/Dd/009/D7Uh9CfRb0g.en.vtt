 e the previous movement as a peep 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:39.460

 etc. you 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.560
 and here is an example that you already know 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.419
 ok for those who have their computer with package 

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:56.259

 binder 

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:08.400
 this same movement simply what the only thing that changes is the presentation 

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.879
 that is, when we arrived at the research folder 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:18.199
 yedlín and we find that package we found that are 

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:22.680
 separating is separated into three folders that we have never seen by 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:29.629
 example episode hoppo to approve is common the ex síndico or something by the 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:34.559
 style I do not know exactly it seemed that they are separated should you believe 

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:39.230
 that's why those folders this pretty much the same as we have here 

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:45.469
 yes it is practically the same nothing else they are going to have to modify bed one of

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.459
 they were failing to activate all -3 and in the same way 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.980
 I do not know why they are handled like this but so work 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.029

 likewise a yes it gives as well as canacintra marita slow but this is beneficial 

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:08.419
 because some with little patience do not see it that way 

00:04:09.279 --> 00:04:12.540
