00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
knife part you actually can sometimes if

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.549 
knife part you actually can sometimes if
you<00:00:53.070> move<00:00:53.340> weird<00:00:53.879> in<00:00:54.149> there<00:00:54.360> like<00:00:54.840> move<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.530> a

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
you move weird in there like move to a

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.220 
you move weird in there like move to a
weird<00:00:55.800> position<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.430> hand<00:00:57.300> or<00:00:57.570> something<00:00:57.960> might

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
weird position a hand or something might

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.650 
weird position a hand or something might
stick<00:00:58.890> out<00:00:59.070> and<00:00:59.460> so<00:00:59.640> if<00:00:59.850> they<00:01:00.000> throw<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.420> good

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
stick out and so if they throw a good

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.389 
stick out and so if they throw a good
enough<00:01:00.930> throwing<00:01:01.260> knife<00:01:01.440> then<00:01:01.829> they<00:01:02.070> can<00:01:02.280> hit

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
enough throwing knife then they can hit

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.160 
enough throwing knife then they can hit
that<00:01:02.460> hand<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.180> that'll<00:01:03.480> kill<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.870> because

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
that hand and that'll kill you because

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.679 
that hand and that'll kill you because
apparently<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:05.189> knife<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.880> hand<00:01:06.119> kills

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
apparently a knife to the hand kills

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:07.280 
apparently a knife to the hand kills
people

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
people

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.960 
people
that's<00:01:08.070> just<00:01:08.340> Cod<00:01:08.580> logic<00:01:09.060> they<00:01:09.710> they<00:01:10.970> defied

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
that's just Cod logic they they defied

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.410 
that's just Cod logic they they defied
laws<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.840> everything<00:01:13.290> everyday<00:01:14.159> so<00:01:14.369> we<00:01:14.909> can't

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
laws of everything everyday so we can't

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.649 
laws of everything everyday so we can't
really<00:01:15.659> argue<00:01:16.200> with<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:16.970> but<00:01:17.970> what<00:01:18.540> we're

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
really argue with that but what we're

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.090 
really argue with that but what we're
gonna<00:01:18.750> do<00:01:18.930> is<00:01:19.110> we're<00:01:19.409> gonna<00:01:19.470> head<00:01:19.770> on<00:01:19.799> down

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.510 
jump and you'll kind of you'll feel
yourself<00:01:43.680> start<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.340> glitch<00:01:45.149> here<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:46.520> you'll

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
yourself start to glitch here and you'll

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.560 
yourself start to glitch here and you'll
know<00:01:47.759> you're<00:01:48.000> about<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.360> go<00:01:48.479> in<00:01:48.689> so<00:01:50.570> some

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
know you're about to go in so some

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.210 
know you're about to go in so some
people<00:01:51.720> you<00:01:51.990> can<00:01:52.110> see<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:52.500> that<00:01:52.770> can<00:01:53.040> just

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
people you can see that that can just

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.399 
people you can see that that can just
run<00:01:53.549> right<00:01:53.820> into<00:01:54.000> this<00:01:54.270> spot<00:01:54.540> too

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.080 

I'm<00:01:58.409> apparently<00:01:58.979> not<00:01:59.310> good<00:01:59.490> enough<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.909> do

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
I'm apparently not good enough to do

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.870 
I'm apparently not good enough to do
that<00:02:00.329> so<00:02:01.020> but<00:02:01.950> it<00:02:02.219> looks<00:02:02.399> like<00:02:02.490> I'm<00:02:02.670> about<00:02:02.820> to

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
that so but it looks like I'm about to

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
honestly but anyway guys this really

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:41.450 
honestly but anyway guys this really
it's<00:04:38.940> really<00:04:39.060> not<00:04:39.630> a<00:04:40.080> good<00:04:40.500> spot<00:04:40.860> for<00:04:41.130> other

people can shoot into it and you're kind
of<00:04:48.990> I<00:04:49.610> mean<00:04:51.950> you<00:04:52.950> don't<00:04:53.100> have<00:04:53.400> any<00:04:53.910> cover<00:04:54.300> at

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
of I mean you don't have any cover at

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.820 
of I mean you don't have any cover at
all<00:04:54.740> going<00:04:55.740> up<00:04:55.890> against<00:04:56.220> a<00:04:56.280> gun<00:04:57.350> so<00:04:58.350> I<00:04:58.380> wouldn't

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
all going up against a gun so I wouldn't

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.969 
all going up against a gun so I wouldn't
really<00:04:59.160> recommend<00:04:59.310> this<00:04:59.940> in<00:05:00.390> a<00:05:00.830> public<00:05:01.830> match

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 
really recommend this in a public match

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:04.490 
really recommend this in a public match
but<00:05:02.760> unless<00:05:03.450> you're<00:05:03.630> doing<00:05:03.750> hiding<00:05:04.320> or

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
but unless you're doing hiding or

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.690 
but unless you're doing hiding or
something<00:05:04.800> less<00:05:04.919> you're<00:05:05.070> just<00:05:05.220> hiding<00:05:05.400> or

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:05.700 
something less you're just hiding or

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.340 
something less you're just hiding or
something<00:05:08.450> another<00:05:09.450> thing<00:05:09.660> good<00:05:09.900> about<00:05:09.930> the

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
something another thing good about the

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:14.330 
something another thing good about the
spot<00:05:10.530> guys<00:05:11.010> is<00:05:11.900> that<00:05:13.010> whenever<00:05:14.010> you're

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
spot guys is that whenever you're

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.120 
spot guys is that whenever you're
playing<00:05:14.520> infected<00:05:15.680> most<00:05:16.680> of<00:05:16.890> the<00:05:16.979> people

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
playing infected most of the people

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.810 
playing infected most of the people
playing<00:05:17.490> infected<00:05:18.120> are<00:05:19.070> dumb<00:05:20.070> enough<00:05:20.310> to<00:05:20.370> keep

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:20.820 
playing infected are dumb enough to keep

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.670 
playing infected are dumb enough to keep
going<00:05:20.880> after<00:05:21.630> the<00:05:21.780> same<00:05:22.020> person<00:05:22.500> that's

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
going after the same person that's

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.050 
going after the same person that's
killing<00:05:23.039> them<00:05:23.160> and<00:05:23.430> they'll<00:05:23.550> set<00:05:23.789> tack

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
killing them and they'll set tack

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.150 
killing them and they'll set tack
inserts<00:05:24.570> all<00:05:24.810> around<00:05:25.140> here

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160
