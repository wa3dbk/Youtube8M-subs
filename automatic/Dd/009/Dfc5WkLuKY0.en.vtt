00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
through how to how I did these which is

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.380 
through how to how I did these which is
this<00:01:49.229> is<00:01:49.409> just<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.649> simple<00:01:49.860> corner<00:01:50.250> pocket

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
this is just a simple corner pocket

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.969 
this is just a simple corner pocket
but<00:01:52.189> I'll<00:01:53.189> also<00:01:53.549> include<00:01:54.119> with<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.290> tutorial

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
but I'll also include with the tutorial
