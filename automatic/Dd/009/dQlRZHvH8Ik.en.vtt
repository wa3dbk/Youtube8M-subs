00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
really well and I think it just looks a

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.410 
really well and I think it just looks a
little<00:02:20.040> bit<00:02:20.250> better<00:02:20.430> and<00:02:20.970> just<00:02:21.030> a<00:02:21.150> little<00:02:21.330> bit

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
little bit better and just a little bit

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.060 
little bit better and just a little bit
more<00:02:21.540> elegant<00:02:21.690> when<00:02:21.990> you<00:02:22.080> do<00:02:22.170> that<00:02:22.320> and<00:02:22.590> that

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
more elegant when you do that and that

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.400 
more elegant when you do that and that
is<00:02:23.310> it<00:02:23.670> for<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:24.060> first<00:02:24.210> hairstyle<00:02:24.420> like<00:02:25.320> I

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
is it for the first hairstyle like I

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.470 
is it for the first hairstyle like I
said<00:02:25.620> really<00:02:26.070> easy<00:02:26.370> but<00:02:26.700> I<00:02:26.730> just<00:02:27.030> really<00:02:27.300> like

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
said really easy but I just really like

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.030 
said really easy but I just really like
the<00:02:27.600> look<00:02:27.720> at<00:02:27.840> this<00:02:27.930> I<00:02:28.110> think<00:02:28.170> it<00:02:28.410> gives<00:02:28.560> off<00:02:28.830> a

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
the look at this I think it gives off a

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.820 
the look at this I think it gives off a
really<00:02:29.430> fun<00:02:29.760> vibe<00:02:30.060> and<00:02:30.540> it's<00:02:31.290> easy<00:02:31.530> it's

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
really fun vibe and it's easy it's

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.710 
really fun vibe and it's easy it's
summery<00:02:32.160> and<00:02:32.490> it's<00:02:32.880> kind<00:02:33.090> of<00:02:33.120> edgy<00:02:33.390> too<00:02:33.510> at<00:02:33.660> the

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
summery and it's kind of edgy too at the

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.410 
summery and it's kind of edgy too at the
same<00:02:33.750> time<00:02:34.080> so<00:02:37.910> also<00:02:38.910> you<00:02:39.090> don't<00:02:39.150> wanna<00:02:39.330> forget

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
same time so also you don't wanna forget

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.449 
same time so also you don't wanna forget
to<00:02:39.660> pull<00:02:39.959> some<00:02:40.230> hair<00:02:40.260> down<00:02:40.980> by<00:02:41.160> your<00:02:41.250> face

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
to pull some hair down by your face

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:42.980 
to pull some hair down by your face
because<00:02:41.760> I<00:02:41.790> feel<00:02:42.090> like<00:02:42.180> it<00:02:42.270> always<00:02:42.420> is<00:02:42.660> good<00:02:42.840> to

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
because I feel like it always is good to

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.449 
because I feel like it always is good to
kind<00:02:43.170> of<00:02:43.200> frame<00:02:43.380> your<00:02:43.590> face<00:02:43.770> with<00:02:44.040> some<00:02:44.250> pieces

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
kind of frame your face with some pieces

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:46.160 
kind of frame your face with some pieces
I<00:02:44.850> think<00:02:45.090> it<00:02:45.300> just<00:02:45.390> kind<00:02:45.570> of<00:02:45.630> gives<00:02:45.720> the<00:02:45.930> look<00:02:46.110> a

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
I think it just kind of gives the look a

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.840 
I think it just kind of gives the look a
little<00:02:46.230> bit<00:02:46.440> more<00:02:46.560> of<00:02:46.620> a<00:02:46.680> casual<00:02:47.040> vibe<00:02:47.160> it's

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
little bit more of a casual vibe it's

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.130 
little bit more of a casual vibe it's
not<00:02:47.940> like<00:02:48.090> you<00:02:48.180> were<00:02:48.270> trying<00:02:48.420> fight<00:02:48.780> so<00:02:48.930> hard

not like you were trying fight so hard

00:02:49.140 --> 00:03:01.990 
not like you were trying fight so hard
so<00:02:49.500> that<00:02:49.739> is<00:02:50.370> it<00:02:50.670> for<00:02:50.940> this<00:02:51.150> first<00:02:51.390> look

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000

is probably my favorite and one that

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:07.820 
is probably my favorite and one that
I've<00:03:06.330> actually<00:03:06.450> had<00:03:06.900> been<00:03:07.020> planning<00:03:07.350> since

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
I've actually had been planning since

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.460 
I've actually had been planning since
like<00:03:08.190> 2010<00:03:09.060> and<00:03:09.540> I<00:03:09.810> just<00:03:09.959> never<00:03:10.110> been<00:03:10.230> able<00:03:10.320> to

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470

so<00:03:11.100> what<00:03:11.670> you<00:03:11.760> do<00:03:11.880> is<00:03:12.000> you<00:03:12.060> just<00:03:12.090> put<00:03:12.269> your<00:03:12.390> hair

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
so what you do is you just put your hair

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.330 
faux hawk I guess and you're just gonna
start<00:04:16.049> off<00:04:16.109> by<00:04:16.140> doing<00:04:16.500> a<00:04:16.590> poof<00:04:16.919> with<00:04:17.190> your

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340

start off by doing a poof with your
bangs<00:04:17.579> and<00:04:17.970> this<00:04:18.090> is<00:04:18.209> gonna<00:04:18.299> kind<00:04:18.660> of<00:04:18.810> balance

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
bangs and this is gonna kind of balance

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.930 
bangs and this is gonna kind of balance
out<00:04:19.829> the<00:04:19.950> look<00:04:19.980> I<00:04:20.280> feel<00:04:20.400> like<00:04:20.459> if<00:04:20.609> you<00:04:20.700> don't<00:04:20.850> do

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
out the look I feel like if you don't do

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.400 
out the look I feel like if you don't do
that<00:04:21.060> front<00:04:21.359> poof<00:04:21.600> it<00:04:21.840> doesn't<00:04:22.109> really<00:04:22.200> bounce

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
that front poof it doesn't really bounce

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:24.140 
that front poof it doesn't really bounce
still<00:04:22.740> look<00:04:22.890> out<00:04:23.010> very<00:04:23.250> well<00:04:23.460> so<00:04:24.120> you

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
still look out very well so you

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.340 
still look out very well so you
definitely<00:04:24.330> want<00:04:24.720> to<00:04:24.750> do<00:04:24.840> that<00:04:24.960> and<00:04:25.169> then
