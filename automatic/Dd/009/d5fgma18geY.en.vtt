on hammock what do you have how many
eggs<00:00:34.720> yet<00:00:37.350> light<00:00:38.350> it<00:00:38.530> up<00:00:38.650> and<00:00:39.660> wait<00:00:40.660> for<00:00:40.870> the

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
three or four minutes to boil with a

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.620 
three or four minutes to boil with a
good<00:00:57.080> quality<00:00:57.260> pot<00:00:58.250> and<00:00:58.400> pan<00:00:58.610> or<00:00:58.910> whatever

00:00:59.620 --> 00:00:59.630 
good quality pot and pan or whatever

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.360 
good quality pot and pan or whatever
going<00:00:59.809> to<00:00:59.870> using<00:01:00.230> make<00:01:00.980> sure<00:01:01.130> it's<00:01:01.220> good

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
going to using make sure it's good

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.729 
going to using make sure it's good
quality<00:01:01.760> because<00:01:01.879> the<00:01:02.870> heat<00:01:03.050> conduction<00:01:03.410> is

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
quality because the heat conduction is

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.060 
quality because the heat conduction is
going<00:01:03.980> to<00:01:04.040> develop<00:01:05.380> and<00:01:06.380> make<00:01:06.560> things<00:01:06.770> a<00:01:06.950> lot

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
going to develop and make things a lot

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.450 
going to develop and make things a lot
lot<00:01:07.610> easier<00:01:07.910> for<00:01:08.119> you<00:01:08.240> so<00:01:09.100> straight<00:01:10.100> in<00:01:10.220> I

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
lot easier for you so straight in I

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.190 
lot easier for you so straight in I
don't<00:01:10.880> bother<00:01:11.090> about<00:01:11.240> putting<00:01:11.720> eggs<00:01:11.840> in<00:01:12.020> them

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
don't bother about putting eggs in them

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.550 
don't bother about putting eggs in them
in<00:01:12.740> a<00:01:13.250> bowl<00:01:13.670> or<00:01:13.940> whatever<00:01:14.090> just<00:01:15.050> chuck<00:01:15.470> them

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
in a bowl or whatever just chuck them

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.590 
in a bowl or whatever just chuck them
straight<00:01:15.860> in<00:01:16.040> makes<00:01:16.760> it<00:01:16.910> life<00:01:17.060> easier<00:01:17.479> and

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:17.600 
straight in makes it life easier and

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:38.219 
straight in makes it life easier and
quicker<00:01:17.720> in<00:01:17.960> India<00:01:18.729> one<00:01:19.729> in<00:01:25.090> two<00:01:26.090> in<00:01:31.750> three<00:01:32.750> in

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:44.469 

for<00:01:39.229> it<00:01:41.410> so<00:01:42.410> they're<00:01:42.649> going<00:01:42.740> to<00:01:42.800> take<00:01:43.450> three<00:01:44.450> or

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
for it so they're going to take three or

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.529 
for it so they're going to take three or
four<00:01:44.570> minutes<00:01:45.050> to<00:01:45.170> cook<00:01:45.380> as<00:01:45.560> well<00:01:46.539> depending

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:47.539 
four minutes to cook as well depending

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:51.490 
four minutes to cook as well depending
on<00:01:47.800> how<00:01:48.800> you<00:01:48.860> like<00:01:49.310> your<00:01:49.490> eggs<00:01:50.140> with<00:01:51.140> the<00:01:51.289> yolk

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
on how you like your eggs with the yolk

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.900 
on how you like your eggs with the yolk
so<00:01:52.450> if<00:01:53.450> you<00:01:53.600> like<00:01:53.840> them<00:01:54.310> running<00:01:55.310> up<00:01:55.490> you're

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
so if you like them running up you're

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.490 
so if you like them running up you're
not<00:01:56.000> going<00:01:56.149> to<00:01:56.240> cook<00:01:56.360> them<00:01:56.509> for<00:01:56.539> as<00:01:56.750> long<00:01:56.869> but

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
not going to cook them for as long but

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.520 
not going to cook them for as long but
if<00:01:57.619> you<00:01:57.649> like<00:01:57.950> them<00:01:58.220> little<00:01:58.880> harder<00:01:59.360> and<00:01:59.569> then

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
if you like them little harder and then

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.260 
if you like them little harder and then
you<00:02:00.770> cook<00:02:01.099> them<00:02:01.220> for<00:02:01.369> a<00:02:01.429> little<00:02:01.580> bit<00:02:01.759> more<00:02:01.940> and

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
you cook them for a little bit more and

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.089 
you cook them for a little bit more and
I<00:02:02.360> only<00:02:02.509> took<00:02:02.720> them<00:02:02.840> like<00:02:03.020> a<00:02:03.080> 1<00:02:03.380> to<00:02:03.560> 2<00:02:03.709> minutes

00:02:04.089 --> 00:02:04.099 
I only took them like a 1 to 2 minutes

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:07.540 
I only took them like a 1 to 2 minutes
more<00:02:04.280> or<00:02:04.520> less<00:02:05.920> you<00:02:06.920> can<00:02:07.039> see<00:02:07.190> we're<00:02:07.340> ready

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
more or less you can see we're ready

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.419 
more or less you can see we're ready
that<00:02:07.789> the<00:02:07.880> water<00:02:08.090> is<00:02:08.179> starting<00:02:08.330> to<00:02:08.479> boil<00:02:08.780> again

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
that the water is starting to boil again

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:15.730 
that the water is starting to boil again
so<00:02:11.470> we<00:02:12.470> want<00:02:12.709> to<00:02:12.800> wait<00:02:13.010> until<00:02:13.780> it's<00:02:14.780> staying<00:02:15.590> to

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
so we want to wait until it's staying to

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.660 
so we want to wait until it's staying to
froth<00:02:15.980> over<00:02:16.190> and<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.980> water<00:02:19.220> covers<00:02:19.640> the

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
froth over and the water covers the

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.089 
froth over and the water covers the
whole<00:02:20.260> whole<00:02:21.260> lot<00:02:21.470> of<00:02:21.560> the<00:02:21.620> eggs<00:02:21.800> so<00:02:22.069> it's

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
whole whole lot of the eggs so it's

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:23.890 
whole whole lot of the eggs so it's
going<00:02:22.430> to<00:02:22.490> be<00:02:22.610> cooking<00:02:22.910> the<00:02:22.970> whole<00:02:23.150> egg<00:02:23.330> so<00:02:23.870> you

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
going to be cooking the whole egg so you

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.860 
going to be cooking the whole egg so you
don't<00:02:24.140> need<00:02:24.290> to<00:02:24.349> worry<00:02:24.470> about<00:02:24.590> putting<00:02:25.040> a

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
don't need to worry about putting a

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.210 
don't need to worry about putting a
putting<00:02:26.870> any<00:02:27.140> vinegar<00:02:27.349> or<00:02:27.650> any<00:02:27.860> of<00:02:27.950> that<00:02:28.010> stuff

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
putting any vinegar or any of that stuff

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.089 
putting any vinegar or any of that stuff
in<00:02:28.459> there<00:02:28.670> there's<00:02:29.599> just<00:02:30.380> stuff<00:02:30.800> you<00:02:30.920> don't

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
in there there's just stuff you don't

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:33.070 
in there there's just stuff you don't
have<00:02:31.250> to<00:02:31.340> do<00:02:31.520> and<00:02:31.790> you<00:02:32.599> don't<00:02:32.780> have<00:02:32.840> to<00:02:32.959> worry

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
have to do and you don't have to worry
