00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.460
 Well, stay still, now the 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.460
 national father 

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:10.639
 I love 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.009
 but I really like it 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.270
 with the arrival of the year 2000 the world 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.219
 He entered a new era of politics 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.260
 international changed forever with the 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:42.760
 terrorist attack on the twin towers and 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.680
 the same thing happened with relationships 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.290
 personal thanks to the creation of 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.180
 facebook in colombia the dialogues of the 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.640
 President Andres Pastrana with the FARC 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.710
 failed and that paved the way for 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.500
 arrival to the power of álvaro uribe vélez 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.360
 also beginning that decade snail and 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.059
 rcn took their first steps as 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.519
 private strings the first big hit what 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:06.340
 They gave fernando gaitán and rcn with betty 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:08.770
 the ugly but between 2001 and 2005 the 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.440
 hegemony was for snail thanks to the 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.030
 I make novels three thematic productions 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.910
 very different but with a common 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.280
 denominator dago garcía other of the 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.990
 famous Colombian librettists are 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.840
 was of course Peter's the 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.840
 scaly saga and deadly sins 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.490
 that I love about capital sins ' is 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.100
 the ability to put together the most archaic 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.189
 with the most postmodern there is another 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:43.119
 besides courage to be optimistic is 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:45.520
 a reality format in which at the same time 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.710
 they are all playing games at 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.520
 Colombian tradition wait for some 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:55.320
 try to record one in the neighborhood 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.320
 hernaniarra while they organize her day 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.880
 with capital sins 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.710
 felipe salamanca and I managed to demonstrate 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.709
 that on television you could also 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:12.620
 experiment reminding the industry 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:15.670
 that another of the DNA elements of 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.670
 Our selection is innovation 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.140
 for me 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.770
 totally innovative either with the 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.680
 different stages that lived the same 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:35.320
 family since its inception that 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.420
 they will reach the field until the fortune that 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:39.540
 they came nation in the city ​​by the 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.640
 mafia or for the things that they 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.330
 they wanted to get those can 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.330
 from Swedish 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:52.230
 with algae showed that also 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:54.360
 I could bet on other genres in a 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.900
 context of soap operas other than 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:00.769
 melodrama that could be tried to play with 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.769
 the tragic genre 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.750
 every time writers 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:16.189
 in history we are in totality that 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.620
 He was a little womanizer and if not already with 

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:20.590
 fifteen 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:23.970
 and fell in love with one that was a little 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:29.739
 higher than he to whom every time 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:31.840
 that he had written a short story a 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.430
 monologue about a character that started 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.590
 saying, my name is Pedro and he says 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.430
 the scaly and summarized as a little the 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.430
 picaresque character 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.800
 one got on the bus and said called pedro 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.870
 we are united by the street said there 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.430
 goes pedro the scaly but the worst of 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.310
 bridge is that we said there is Pedro 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.990
 we are when we should say I have 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.590
 some Pedro the flaky but the 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:57.200
 rest was very fun 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:04:00.590
 and he had a lot of jokes he laughed at 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:03.980
 one and always with super vip but lynn 's 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:06.560
 lahore some occasion we were 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:10.069
 writing with salamanca and on a 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:12.349
 song and I got to suck cock with 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:16.420
 a danced and felipe immediately I say 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:16.420
 so Pedro has to dance the flaky 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:22.959
 and where Miguel teaches him to dance Miguel 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.959
 I add the little step of the ears 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:32.520
 and the lollipop not what I connected was with 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.069
 that inability of ours that we have of 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.539
 of self-criticism in dancing us 

00:04:35.069 --> 00:04:38.430
 Colombians we believe that there are two faces 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:40.229
 what we do spectacular we believe that 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.150
 we dance like gods which is not 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:44.550
 true and the second we think we sing 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.740
 and federer this saddle is I want a 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.690
 novel where we were betting on 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.550
 something that was already a transit that was coming 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:53.310
 making Colombian television had 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:55.979
 happened with betty had happened before 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.259
 with Padre Pio fifth had happened 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:00.539
 in other times with the novels of marten 

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:01.770
 goiter some elements of humor were 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:03.539
 present in the novels of July 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:07.289
 jiménez and what happened with our 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:09.690
 generation was that we already capitalized myself 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:11.930
 I think that from products like 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.340
 betty the ugly and like pedro the scaly 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.840
 Colombia began to appear as a 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.610
 important player in the market 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.830
 international and what was interesting was who 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.409
 he did it with a product of his own 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.180
 harvest pedro the scaly saga and 

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:26.009
 capital sins ' were three 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.289
 productions that gave snail in 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:31.440
 its beginnings as a private channel one of 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:33.690
 its best times one after another and each 

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.460
 a different one but the same as the previous one 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.380
 imposed on the rating obtained the 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.270
 industry awards and contributed 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:42.360
 to show a successful path in terms of 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:44.640
 production and at least doubtful in 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.920
 regarding the aesthetics of his proposals to 

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:49.680
 Garcia needs to be acknowledged that he has done 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.540
 a lot of narrative innovation and basically 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.630
 he is not recognized because his proposal 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:58.920
 aesthetics is very much like I do not care 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:06:00.900
 puntocom the planes the scenarios the 

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:03.450
 camera moments the second aesthetic 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:05.580
 because he never charges tobacco he never says 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:07.560
 is that I made this evolution that 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:09.030
 I was trying to think about the country design 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.800
 like industry 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:12.840
 iago industry and I want to 

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:14.400
 entertainment and then I also support 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.750
 has led people to not recognize their 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.030
 real value in Colombian television 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:21.300
 the one I remember the most was that we 

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:24.690
 we were meeting with my mom and my sister was 

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:28.970
 my niece to watch TV and then 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:31.350
 to comment that I was going to move to the next day 

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:34.020
 intrigue for the other day that was going to happen 

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:37.430
 and bet we go to the one who was telling the truth 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:42.060
 that he has not been burdened with the cold 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:47.370
 come if I'm not wrong on August 22 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:50.870
 of 1999 with 30 years behind my back and 

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:50.870
 more empty than the fuck
