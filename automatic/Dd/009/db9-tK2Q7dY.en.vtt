this<00:00:14.160> map<00:00:14.490> and<00:00:14.759> figure<00:00:15.030> it<00:00:15.150> out<00:00:15.360> so<00:00:15.540> that<00:00:15.599> I<00:00:15.690> can

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
this map and figure it out so that I can

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.939 
this map and figure it out so that I can
beat<00:00:16.170> it<00:00:16.640> by<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.699> end<00:00:18.029> of<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.390> night<00:00:18.770> so<00:00:19.770> I<00:00:19.800> can

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
gotta turn around see and a lot of the

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.479 
gotta turn around see and a lot of the
keys<00:00:51.719> are<00:00:52.140> in<00:00:52.500> places<00:00:52.949> where<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.190> have<00:00:53.340> to

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
keys are in places where you have to

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:54.680 
keys are in places where you have to
turn<00:00:53.610> around<00:00:53.760> which<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.180> really<00:00:54.390> unfortunate

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
turn around which is really unfortunate

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.689 
turn around which is really unfortunate
I<00:00:56.420> gotta<00:00:57.420> admit<00:00:57.539> I<00:00:58.010> was<00:00:59.010> hoping<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.430> was<00:00:59.489> going

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
I gotta admit I was hoping I was going

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.790 
I gotta admit I was hoping I was going
to<00:00:59.789> spawn<00:01:00.090> somewhere<00:01:00.510> else<00:01:00.660> another<00:01:01.590> thing

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
to spawn somewhere else another thing

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.920 
to spawn somewhere else another thing
with<00:01:01.949> this<00:01:02.070> map<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:02.670> spawn<00:01:03.030> in<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.480> in<00:01:03.809> a

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
with this map is you spawn in it in a

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.530 
with this map is you spawn in it in a
different<00:01:04.140> location<00:01:05.060> every<00:01:06.060> time<00:01:06.270> so<00:01:06.450> you

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
different location every time so you

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.230 
different location every time so you
never<00:01:06.630> know<00:01:06.810> where<00:01:06.960> you're<00:01:07.049> going<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.260> spawn

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
never know where you're going to spawn

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.210 
never know where you're going to spawn
which<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.450> unfortunate<00:01:10.229> for<00:01:10.260> me<00:01:10.409> because<00:01:10.530> I

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
which is unfortunate for me because I

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.440 
which is unfortunate for me because I
like<00:01:11.549> to<00:01:13.100> start<00:01:14.100> from<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.729> same<00:01:14.970> point<00:01:15.270> so

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
like to start from the same point so

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.359 
like to start from the same point so
I'll<00:01:15.570> use<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.780> as<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.930> reference<00:01:15.960> point<00:01:16.320> but<00:01:17.250> the

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
I'll use it as a reference point but the

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.280 
I'll use it as a reference point but the
reference<00:01:17.700> point<00:01:17.970> that<00:01:18.119> I<00:01:18.180> do<00:01:18.240> have<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.869> over

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
reference point that I do have is over

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.450 
reference point that I do have is over
here<00:01:21.710> usually<00:01:22.710> it'd<00:01:22.799> be<00:01:23.040> my<00:01:23.189> key<00:01:23.369> number<00:01:23.610> one

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
here usually it'd be my key number one

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.280 
here usually it'd be my key number one
then<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:26.490> de<00:01:26.640> Meyer<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:29.390> another<00:01:30.390> thing<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.840> you

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
then I de Meyer and another thing is you

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.700 
then I de Meyer and another thing is you
