00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:06.820
 Not and the powder is thin like this 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:10.240
 I will go in front of Matcha powder like this 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:13.299
 Yes, we have wound powder of yellow-green color to such Fu 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:17.800
 I think a little more expressive 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:20.090
 Yes, I also got some green powder and it might be a bit confusing 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.120
 Yes yes and to some extent 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:27.289
 Like a time powder that went before and story When you have finished Seriously 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:29.289
 We will fix to woodworking bond aqueous solution 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:29.289
 Hmm 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:38.400
 In such Fu Kedomo Yes it's such next day you have finished up the powder 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:44.370
 Bond is dry and ticking with a little bit 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:47.340
 Fine soil from which I'm also the ne green pot of who I think has become greenish liquid waste has come out very well 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.440
 So what do you do? 1 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:55.690
 I think that I want to make the grass with this Yes 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:56.170
 It feels like Mokomoko's Momo Mofu's green sponge is included and this porridge 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.649
 this 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:05.510
 Such wind that will directly put in woodworking bond 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:11.710
 I would like to attach a bond here too, so this year and this area 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:11.710
 Be recently be better to put in here that I think would like to have it in something like this 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.700
 Yes I 'm going to put in bond like this a little like this I can see the white place 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:26.259
 I'm sorry but 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:28.450
 It 's OK because it will be the back side if it hardens It 's all right to put in the leaves like this after using 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:32.590
 It is convenient to save 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:36.230
 I finished the winding of Hai Phong city . 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:40.190
 It looks like this when you look at the enemy aircraft from behind 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:45.800
 I think that I will add the Fordridge again while watching the situation from now on 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:49.760
 I wonder how this feels quite like a module 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:55.610
 Yes So tried to represent the grass with salt prime this time 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:59.330
 Next time , I would like to express the ground using this scene production set again. 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:07.130
 See you in the video again Thank you very much 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:07.130
