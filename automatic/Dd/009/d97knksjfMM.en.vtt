different color Yoshi never though um
because<00:01:15.720> your<00:01:16.229> sh<00:01:16.320> maybe<00:01:16.560> if<00:01:16.830> she<00:01:16.979> might<00:01:17.159> have

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
because your sh maybe if she might have

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.190 
because your sh maybe if she might have
because<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.390> know<00:01:18.450> she<00:01:18.509> trapped<00:01:18.930> all<00:01:19.110> the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
because you know she trapped all the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.960 
because you know she trapped all the
different<00:01:19.470> colored<00:01:19.710> Yoshi's<00:01:20.070> in<00:01:20.250> star<00:01:20.700> road

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
different colored Yoshi's in star road

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.340 
different colored Yoshi's in star road
and<00:01:21.210> they<00:01:22.140> broke<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.830> road<00:01:22.979> apart<00:01:23.369> I<00:01:24.350> think

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
and they broke the road apart I think

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.080 
and they broke the road apart I think
that<00:01:25.470> happened<00:01:25.830> what<00:01:26.460> happens<00:01:26.759> if<00:01:26.850> we<00:01:26.939> unite

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
that happened what happens if we unite

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.749 
that happened what happens if we unite
all<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.420> Yoshi's<00:01:27.869> I<00:01:28.080> don't<00:01:28.680> know<00:01:28.770> maybe
