 that the new house will not come with a 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.260
 new incursion or rate has said so 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.760
 goÃ±i has mentioned that we will have a 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.020
 new network with the content that will come 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.879

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.710
 referring to the comment forgiveness is that already 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.420

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.050
 cooperative to make players instead 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.780
 of that will come a new mode called the 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.129
 person of elders the sand that like 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.320
 that kings was the content for the 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.190
 higher level governance will be difficult and 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.420
 more varied than we are 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.890
 accustomed 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.930
 this will be for squares of three 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.270
 players if they ask about all the 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.470
 filtered images that we had before 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.270
 of the new king being the sand 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.400

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.720
 that we make our mouths water with 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.220
 sets of legendary armor that 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.440

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.540
 a video that I did explain to those in the 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.790

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.250
 following that Wednesday, May 6 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.840
 We will have the live link that will show us 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.550
 the cooperative mode of prison or 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.620
 faithfuls that we will have instead of the 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.570
 raid here have left us an image 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.400
 to give us an idea of the area that 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.200
 shows here because it's a totally 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.480
 new that did not appear any those that 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.550
 we already have so we can deduce that 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.500
 this new cooperative mission to be 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.730
 for three players will be in an area 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.190
 completely different from the one that already 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.840
 we have in the game so nothing guys 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.760

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.050

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.340
