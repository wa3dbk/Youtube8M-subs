00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.739
 I had a member this morning 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.379
 He was visited two days outside 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.289
 alarm so the praxes have in the 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:47.020
 most regions as good as matches 

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:50.530
 the carp already partly there are still 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.940
 Certainly there you are still so 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.770
 not so sure when to go 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.489
 But the week I think there again 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.590
 it is good weather 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.450
 a lot will happen then it is 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.690
 I am also pretty much around 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:04.259
 drove over to Alsace 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:08.110
 there are two more looked at and 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:09.939
 yes, then I'm in luck with the fish 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.670
 lens come I already last 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:16.210
 year he had caught anyway 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.560
 the where on the belly along too small 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.190
 adhesions has to train number 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.299
 feel bloodshot or say 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.750
 say inflammation now 

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:27.010
 I think that's right, that's one 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.470
 Fish has an immune deficiency 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.090
 perceives more to the mostly lies only 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.820
 on the belly is extremely weakened 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.409
 then he eats again and have colleague 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.880
 We now confirmed they had it now 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:38.830
 he has often seen him 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.560
 mostly always swims in the area 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.270
 and that's where it's off 34 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.100
 minutes you even speak up to ten 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.320
 minute on stomach then he swims 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.360
 but it is always up to you 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.960
 belly moving player has briefly 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.650
 energy but by this immunodeficiency 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.480
 I think 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:00.870
 good that I like it much more often then 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:05.820
 another fisherman's fish another 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:08.280
 Fish were extremely active 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:12.810
 mostly only on the belly on the 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.790
 water bottom and so I could 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.420
 well imagine this is something with one 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.610
 immunodeficiency stewart yes there wishes you 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:26.120
 Now a nice week 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.120
 It's all well and we'll see
