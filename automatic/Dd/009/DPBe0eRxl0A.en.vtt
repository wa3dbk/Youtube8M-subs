00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:14.240
 I have meat today for Peter 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:17.450
 played we want to show that that 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.320
 not great is easy to be and 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.290
 to be eaten 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:25.430
 you have everything alive are they there 

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:28.610
 to be killed for actually always 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.070
 again flesh frey lived but now 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.190
 the first time in three years 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.149
 continuously and I stay with it 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.980
 the basic decision was fundamental 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:38.960
 Actually, that's all now 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.610
 I really do not want to be healthier 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.860
 feed in that sense and that's why 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:47.180
 no meat and we prefer to pull a lot 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:49.490
 pure vegetables but thats me already 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.320
 decision for creatures nobody 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:54.440
 is his dog and his cat but yes 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.390
 one may indeed feel animals what animals 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.590
 and we think I meanwhile 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:02.570
 even to say that not her 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.980
 is sensitive and has feelings why wants 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.659
 you got any other thing 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.100
 here the earth as well as we populated 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:08.479
 why do we sometimes just kinda sorry 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.880
 and why if you flatten it 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.859
 everyone who has listened a bit 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.659
 or a little attention is the 

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:16.520
 the animals do not run outside then 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.079
 in the forest around but those are and where 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.030
 a companion will be fattened up 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:23.210
 be bred from a to b in 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.850
 Any car truck moves the tight 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.710
 as it's dirty com in the slaughterhouse 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.540
 have stress 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.900
 [Music] 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.310
 it is always a theme it's stupid 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.440
 But it is always a topic that the 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.440
 he can handle everything like that 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.870
 has put to sera no bad 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.040
 to have certain 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.480
 give the first time to the other 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.310
 we also summarize some 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.440
 meanwhile not with you or 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.970
 Something is there or why or what is 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.950
 because then you happen or you are allowed to do that 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.630
 not allergy so you're afraid 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.360
 that people actually say that was 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.600
 super great one more that you look 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.030
 always explain 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.990
 as a vegetarian or have been born 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.640
 that as a child already practiced but have 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.350
 try to eat a little meat what 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.479
 not difficult and that maybe 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.950
 someday even says you have to come 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.440
 actually still works 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.090
 differently what happens more often that the 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.730
 people then in conversation then yes I say 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.709
 it is only organic meat stronger 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.450
 Nevertheless, the animals anyway 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.840
 we have no fun slaughtered 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.840
 I believe 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:32.509
