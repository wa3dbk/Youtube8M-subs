myself<00:00:21.990> I've<00:00:22.170> been<00:00:22.350> a<00:00:22.410> Dell<00:00:22.680> user<00:00:22.949> for<00:00:23.990> many

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
myself I've been a Dell user for many

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.109 
myself I've been a Dell user for many
years<00:00:25.410> and<00:00:25.740> my<00:00:25.859> current<00:00:26.250> computer<00:00:26.609> is<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:26.760> Dell

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
years and my current computer is a Dell

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.109 
years and my current computer is a Dell
Vostro<00:00:27.660> 1410<00:00:28.470> which<00:00:29.250> I<00:00:29.400> think<00:00:29.670> is<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:29.820> little

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
Vostro 1410 which I think is a little

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.420 
Vostro 1410 which I think is a little
different<00:00:30.660> from<00:00:30.869> this<00:00:31.019> machine<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.619> know<00:00:32.130> that

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
different from this machine I know that

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.720 
different from this machine I know that
del<00:00:32.700> voto<00:00:33.210> wine<00:00:33.600> was<00:00:33.809> supposed<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.230> be<00:00:34.610> sort<00:00:35.610> of

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730

del voto wine was supposed to be sort of
a<00:00:36.050> lower<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.469> I<00:00:38.100> guess<00:00:38.399> compared<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:39.000> their

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
a lower and I guess compared to their

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.389 
a lower and I guess compared to their
latitude<00:00:39.570> as<00:00:39.989> far<00:00:40.170> as<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.379> price<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.129> then<00:00:41.219> also

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
latitude as far as a price and then also

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.040 
latitude as far as a price and then also
the<00:00:41.670> software<00:00:42.030> that<00:00:42.239> was<00:00:42.329> installed<00:00:42.719> on<00:00:42.870> it

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
the software that was installed on it

believe there might be some power in
this<00:03:18.490> because<00:03:19.000> it<00:03:19.420> was<00:03:22.350> police<00:03:23.350> started<00:03:23.800> up

this because it was police started up

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.340 
this because it was police started up
and<00:03:24.130> there's<00:03:24.280> a<00:03:24.810> password<00:03:25.810> set<00:03:26.110> on<00:03:26.290> it<00:03:28.140> this<00:03:29.140> is

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
and there's a password set on it this is

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:34.710 
and there's a password set on it this is
it<00:03:29.560> it<00:03:30.540> is<00:03:31.540> a<00:03:31.570> pretty<00:03:31.960> thin<00:03:32.560> model<00:03:33.370> I<00:03:33.720> don't

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
it it is a pretty thin model I don't

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.230 
it it is a pretty thin model I don't
believe<00:03:35.110> there<00:03:35.290> is<00:03:35.500> a<00:03:35.530> CD<00:03:36.510> or<00:03:37.510> dvd<00:03:38.050> on<00:03:38.260> it

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:39.240 
believe there is a CD or dvd on it

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:42.290 
believe there is a CD or dvd on it
this<00:03:40.240> is<00:03:40.420> probably<00:03:40.690> about<00:03:41.080> what<00:03:41.590> little<00:03:41.920> over

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
this is probably about what little over

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.570 
this is probably about what little over
1/2<00:03:43.300> inch<00:03:43.510> or<00:03:43.690> 3/4<00:03:44.200> inches<00:03:45.240> headphones<00:03:46.240> and

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:47.580 
1/2 inch or 3/4 inches headphones and

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:53.750 
1/2 inch or 3/4 inches headphones and
microphone<00:03:49.050> jack<00:03:50.050> this<00:03:50.320> looks<00:03:50.560> like<00:03:51.720> power

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
microphone jack this looks like power

00:03:53.760 --> 00:04:02.300 
microphone jack this looks like power

I'm<00:04:03.310> not<00:04:03.490> sure<00:04:03.640> these<00:04:03.760> might<00:04:04.000> be<00:04:04.120> selling<00:04:04.360> the

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
I'm not sure these might be selling the

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:11.340 
I'm not sure these might be selling the
other<00:04:04.630> high-end<00:04:04.870> video<00:04:05.230> Ethernet<00:04:10.080> so<00:04:11.080> as<00:04:11.170> far

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
other high-end video Ethernet so as far

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.650 
other high-end video Ethernet so as far
as<00:04:11.410> its<00:04:11.650> weight<00:04:11.860> it's<00:04:12.220> a<00:04:12.370> little<00:04:13.210> heavier<00:04:13.540> than

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
as its weight it's a little heavier than

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.979 
as its weight it's a little heavier than
I<00:04:14.140> then<00:04:14.830> it<00:04:14.950> looks<00:04:15.330> but<00:04:16.330> I<00:04:16.570> don't<00:04:16.750> know<00:04:16.870> the

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
I then it looks but I don't know the

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:20.340 
I then it looks but I don't know the
actual<00:04:17.140> weight<00:04:17.440> of<00:04:17.470> it<00:04:17.739> I<00:04:18.840> believe<00:04:19.840> in<00:04:19.989> here<00:04:20.200> is

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:20.350 
actual weight of it I believe in here is

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:36.200 
actual weight of it I believe in here is
just<00:04:20.380> the<00:04:21.690> power<00:04:22.690> supply

power up they're actually booting it up
let's<00:05:07.090> see<00:05:07.180> how<00:05:07.300> that<00:05:07.360> looks<00:05:07.480> on<00:05:07.780> the<00:05:07.900> screen

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:11.280 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.410 

if<00:05:12.280> this<00:05:12.490> is<00:05:12.610> just<00:05:12.820> going<00:05:12.940> to<00:05:13.000> go<00:05:13.120> through<00:05:13.150> the

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:13.420 
if this is just going to go through the

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:19.740 
if this is just going to go through the
start<00:05:13.720> of<00:05:13.840> Windows<00:05:14.200> I<00:05:14.590> am<00:05:14.740> going<00:05:15.070> to<00:05:18.750> leave

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
start of Windows I am going to leave

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.330 
start of Windows I am going to leave
this<00:05:19.900> for<00:05:20.080> another<00:05:20.140> time

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:28.020 

looks<00:05:24.340> like<00:05:24.520> built-in<00:05:26.460> webcam<00:05:27.460> in<00:05:27.880> there

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
looks like built-in webcam in there

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.860 
looks like built-in webcam in there
which<00:05:28.180> is<00:05:28.330> nice<00:05:28.740> the<00:05:29.740> Dell<00:05:30.190> rostro<00:05:30.940> 1410<00:05:31.690> that

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
which is nice the Dell rostro 1410 that

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.260 
which is nice the Dell rostro 1410 that
I<00:05:31.900> have<00:05:32.200> doesn't<00:05:33.010> have<00:05:33.220> the<00:05:33.460> webcam<00:05:33.640> built<00:05:34.120> in

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
I have doesn't have the webcam built in

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:39.210 
I have doesn't have the webcam built in
but<00:05:34.420> I<00:05:34.480> guess<00:05:34.540> it<00:05:34.810> was<00:05:34.960> an<00:05:35.140> option<00:05:37.590> so<00:05:38.590> looking

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.220 
but I guess it was an option so looking

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:44.610 
but I guess it was an option so looking
at<00:05:39.310> the<00:05:39.400> keyboard<00:05:40.350> full<00:05:41.350> keyboard<00:05:43.500> options<00:05:44.500> on

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
at the keyboard full keyboard options on

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:49.490 
at the keyboard full keyboard options on
the<00:05:44.740> function<00:05:45.160> keys<00:05:45.930> looks<00:05:46.930> like<00:05:47.110> a<00:05:47.140> good<00:05:47.410> feel

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
the function keys looks like a good feel

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:58.920 
the function keys looks like a good feel
the<00:05:50.500> pad

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:58.930 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:00.930 

so<00:05:59.500> let's<00:05:59.650> like<00:05:59.740> go<00:05:59.860> set<00:06:00.130> up<00:06:00.250> with<00:06:00.400> a<00:06:00.430> log<00:06:00.699> in

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:00.940 
so let's like go set up with a log in

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.050 
so let's like go set up with a log in
here<00:06:02.009> not<00:06:03.009> sure<00:06:03.190> what<00:06:03.310> that<00:06:03.370> is<00:06:03.520> right<00:06:03.850> now<00:06:04.030> I

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.060 
here not sure what that is right now I

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.480 
here not sure what that is right now I
have<00:06:04.540> it<00:06:04.660> written<00:06:04.780> down<00:06:04.900> someplace<00:06:05.340> but<00:06:06.340> as

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.490 
have it written down someplace but as

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.230 
have it written down someplace but as
far<00:06:06.699> as<00:06:06.850> it's<00:06:07.060> um<00:06:07.710> pretty<00:06:08.710> thin

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:10.240 
far as it's um pretty thin

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.629 
far as it's um pretty thin
probably<00:06:11.080> would<00:06:11.530> have<00:06:11.860> a<00:06:11.979> nice<00:06:12.160> little<00:06:12.340> case

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:12.639 
probably would have a nice little case

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:15.510 
probably would have a nice little case
for<00:06:12.910> this<00:06:13.060> there<00:06:13.270> is<00:06:13.449> no<00:06:13.630> CD<00:06:14.080> so<00:06:14.919> it's<00:06:15.070> probably

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:15.520 
for this there is no CD so it's probably

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:20.189 
for this there is no CD so it's probably
a<00:06:17.940> USB<00:06:18.940> Drive<00:06:19.240> that<00:06:19.419> you<00:06:19.479> could<00:06:19.660> use<00:06:19.840> but<00:06:20.050> then

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:20.199 
a USB Drive that you could use but then

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:22.800 
a USB Drive that you could use but then
again<00:06:20.410> how<00:06:20.620> many<00:06:20.680> CD<00:06:21.180> CDs<00:06:22.180> you<00:06:22.330> actually<00:06:22.630> use

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:22.810 
again how many CD CDs you actually use

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:24.360 
again how many CD CDs you actually use
during<00:06:23.229> the<00:06:23.259> day<00:06:23.320> although<00:06:23.919> it<00:06:24.009> does<00:06:24.160> come

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:24.370 
during the day although it does come

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:28.340 
during the day although it does come
with<00:06:24.400> CDs<00:06:24.820> interestingly<00:06:25.740> I<00:06:26.740> like<00:06:27.550> the<00:06:27.669> color

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:28.350 
with CDs interestingly I like the color

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:32.930 
with CDs interestingly I like the color
the<00:06:29.350> color<00:06:29.590> is<00:06:29.830> just<00:06:29.860> on<00:06:30.280> the<00:06:30.789> cover<00:06:31.210> here<00:06:31.630> and

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:32.940 
the color is just on the cover here and

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.800 
the color is just on the cover here and
not<00:06:33.940> on<00:06:33.970> the<00:06:34.240> inside

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:36.810 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:40.800 

yeah<00:06:37.810> your<00:06:38.020> standard<00:06:38.760> light<00:06:39.760> displays<00:06:40.240> here<00:06:40.630> a

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:40.810 
yeah your standard light displays here a

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:46.290 
yeah your standard light displays here a
pretty<00:06:41.560> thin<00:06:41.830> profile<00:06:44.669> I'm<00:06:45.669> looking<00:06:46.000> forward

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:46.300 
pretty thin profile I'm looking forward

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.879 
pretty thin profile I'm looking forward
