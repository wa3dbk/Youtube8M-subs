stuck<00:00:09.210> with<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.389> game<00:00:09.570> plan<00:00:09.599> that<00:00:09.960> we<00:00:10.080> had<00:00:10.260> you

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
stuck with the game plan that we had you

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.740 
stuck with the game plan that we had you
know<00:00:10.530> like<00:00:10.710> i<00:00:10.830> said<00:00:10.860> before<00:00:11.360> media<00:00:12.360> created

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
know like i said before media created

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.810 
know like i said before media created
moran<00:00:13.410> into<00:00:13.620> what<00:00:13.740> he<00:00:13.830> was<00:00:14.009> great<00:00:14.580> fighter

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
moran into what he was great fighter

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.700 
moran into what he was great fighter
obviously<00:00:15.299> could<00:00:15.480> punch<00:00:15.660> like<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:15.870> mule<00:00:16.109> but

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
obviously could punch like a mule but

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.349 
obviously could punch like a mule but
our<00:00:16.949> game<00:00:17.190> plan<00:00:17.220> was<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.730> keep<00:00:17.880> him<00:00:18.090> going

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
our game plan was to keep him going

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:19.939 
our game plan was to keep him going
backwards<00:00:18.810> because<00:00:19.380> he<00:00:19.470> can't<00:00:19.710> fight<00:00:19.920> that

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
backwards because he can't fight that

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.890 
backwards because he can't fight that
well<00:00:20.279> going<00:00:20.460> back<00:00:20.699> and<00:00:21.330> we<00:00:21.449> didn't<00:00:21.660> want<00:00:21.689> him

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
well going back and we didn't want him

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.330 
well going back and we didn't want him
to<00:00:21.960> set<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.289> pace<00:00:22.439> to<00:00:22.619> set<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:22.890> tempo<00:00:23.189> with

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
to set the pace to set the tempo with

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.099 
to set the pace to set the tempo with
them<00:00:23.460> big<00:00:23.609> right<00:00:23.820> hands<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.510> I<00:00:24.570> think<00:00:24.630> towards

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
them big right hands and I think towards

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.420 
them big right hands and I think towards
in<00:00:25.230> a<00:00:25.380> fight<00:00:25.560> we<00:00:25.769> sort<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.039> wearing<00:00:26.279> him<00:00:26.369> down

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
in a fight we sort of wearing him down

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.450 
in a fight we sort of wearing him down
and<00:00:27.090> he<00:00:27.180> died<00:00:27.359> much<00:00:27.630> left<00:00:27.900> in<00:00:28.019> them<00:00:28.109> at<00:00:28.199> all

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
and he died much left in them at all

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.220 
and he died much left in them at all
could<00:00:29.460> you<00:00:29.640> even<00:00:29.880> sense<00:00:30.330> in<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.630> first<00:00:30.900> round

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
could you even sense in the first round

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.400 
could you even sense in the first round
that<00:00:31.560> he<00:00:31.710> was<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:31.920> little<00:00:32.250> confused<00:00:32.910> by<00:00:33.899> your

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
that he was a little confused by your

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.860 
that he was a little confused by your
onslaught<00:00:35.160> I<00:00:35.430> think<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.480> hit<00:00:36.570> me<00:00:36.690> with<00:00:36.809> a

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
onslaught I think so and hit me with a

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.209 
onslaught I think so and hit me with a
couple<00:00:36.989> clean<00:00:37.290> punches<00:00:37.500> in<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.800> first<00:00:38.010> round

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
couple clean punches in the first round

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.010 
couple clean punches in the first round
I<00:00:38.460> think<00:00:39.030> we<00:00:39.120> really<00:00:39.360> surprised<00:00:39.719> him<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:39.989> I

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
I think we really surprised him that I

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.560 
I think we really surprised him that I
took<00:00:40.079> him<00:00:40.350> so<00:00:40.500> well<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:40.969> you<00:00:41.969> know<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.329> after

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
took him so well and you know and after

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.060 
took him so well and you know and after
that<00:00:42.660> I<00:00:42.719> took<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.930> cot<00:00:43.140> once<00:00:43.350> he<00:00:43.469> felt<00:00:43.680> my<00:00:43.800> power

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
that I took a cot once he felt my power

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.680 
that I took a cot once he felt my power
like<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:44.760> was<00:00:44.879> saying<00:00:44.940> before<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.390> lot<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.600> these

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
like I was saying before a lot of these

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.970 
like I was saying before a lot of these
guys<00:00:45.870> gone<00:00:46.140> my<00:00:46.260> pirate<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.680> don't<00:00:46.829> look<00:00:46.920> like

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
guys gone my pirate it don't look like

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.069 
guys gone my pirate it don't look like
much<00:00:47.309> on<00:00:47.460> TV<00:00:47.789> but<00:00:48.270> once<00:00:48.450> they<00:00:48.570> get<00:00:48.750> in<00:00:48.840> there<00:00:48.960> is

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
much on TV but once they get in there is

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.959 
much on TV but once they get in there is
like<00:00:49.230> whoa<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:49.770> know<00:00:49.800> this<00:00:50.160> guy<00:00:50.309> is<00:00:50.370> strong<00:00:50.700> I

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
like whoa you know this guy is strong I

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.729 
like whoa you know this guy is strong I
think<00:00:51.480> he<00:00:51.570> felt<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:51.960> from<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.110> first<00:00:52.320> round<00:00:52.530> on

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
think he felt it from the first round on

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.470 
think he felt it from the first round on
also<00:00:53.160> I<00:00:53.370> think<00:00:53.730> when<00:00:53.910> he<00:00:53.969> seen<00:00:54.149> he<00:00:54.239> couldn't

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
also I think when he seen he couldn't

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.910 
also I think when he seen he couldn't
hurt<00:00:54.570> me<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:54.840> he<00:00:54.930> felt<00:00:55.140> my<00:00:55.260> power<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.649> he<00:00:55.770> was

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
hurt me and he felt my power that he was

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.590 
hurt me and he felt my power that he was
really<00:00:56.160> worried<00:00:57.829> when<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:59.100> had<00:00:59.430> that<00:00:59.789> great

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
really worried when you had that great

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.590 
really worried when you had that great
sixth<00:01:01.140> round<00:01:01.430> did<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.730> think<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.270> the

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
sixth round did you think that the

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.920 
sixth round did you think that the
referee<00:01:04.019> was<00:01:04.140> taking<00:01:04.710> an<00:01:04.860> awful<00:01:05.250> long<00:01:05.280> time

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
referee was taking an awful long time

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.230 
referee was taking an awful long time
after<00:01:06.930> your<00:01:07.080> knock<00:01:07.320> at<00:01:07.560> knockdown<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.520> that
