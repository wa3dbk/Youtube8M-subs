00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
a size

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.280 
a size
and<00:02:13.370> you<00:02:13.490> would<00:02:13.640> usually<00:02:13.820> get<00:02:14.210> so<00:02:14.630> instead<00:02:14.990> of

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
and you would usually get so instead of

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.440 
and you would usually get so instead of
buying<00:02:15.830> a<00:02:16.040> corset<00:02:16.430> maybe<00:02:16.760> three<00:02:17.120> to<00:02:17.240> four

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
buying a corset maybe three to four

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.180 
buying a corset maybe three to four
inches<00:02:17.780> smaller<00:02:18.080> than<00:02:18.410> your<00:02:18.560> waist<00:02:18.740> size<00:02:18.920> it

inches smaller than your waist size it

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.220 
inches smaller than your waist size it
might<00:02:19.640> fit<00:02:19.850> better<00:02:20.090> if<00:02:20.330> you<00:02:20.510> bought<00:02:20.780> a<00:02:20.810> course

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
might fit better if you bought a course

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.930 
might fit better if you bought a course
at<00:02:21.380> two<00:02:21.590> to<00:02:21.710> three<00:02:21.950> inches<00:02:22.100> smaller<00:02:22.430> than<00:02:22.760> your

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
waist size and I know that's not very

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.590 
waist size and I know that's not very
much<00:02:24.770> reduction<00:02:25.070> at<00:02:25.340> all<00:02:25.490> but<00:02:25.910> this<00:02:26.150> is<00:02:26.360> a<00:02:26.390> type

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
much reduction at all but this is a type

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.110 
much reduction at all but this is a type
of<00:02:26.630> corset<00:02:27.230> that<00:02:27.320> I<00:02:27.350> would<00:02:27.620> probably<00:02:27.800> use<00:02:28.120> more

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
of corset that I would probably use more

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.100 
of corset that I would probably use more
for<00:02:30.160> fashion<00:02:31.160> like<00:02:31.580> a<00:02:31.610> corset<00:02:32.480> style<00:02:32.690> belt

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
longer torso then I would recommend

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.360 
longer torso then I would recommend
buying<00:02:38.450> a<00:02:38.690> longer<00:02:39.020> corset<00:02:39.530> if<00:02:39.680> you<00:02:40.010> have<00:02:40.190> any

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370

going<00:02:45.500> to<00:02:45.590> cover<00:02:45.860> it<00:02:46.100> because<00:02:46.220> it<00:02:46.550> comes<00:02:46.820> down

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
going to cover it because it comes down

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.870 
going to cover it because it comes down
maybe<00:02:47.690> about<00:02:48.500> two<00:02:48.800> inches<00:02:49.100> below<00:02:49.160> my<00:02:49.550> belly

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
pretty much the same way that they

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.550 
pretty much the same way that they
usually<00:03:03.860> have<00:03:04.850> it<00:03:05.090> in<00:03:05.300> Thomas<00:03:05.840> trends<00:03:06.110> corsets

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
usually have it in Thomas trends corsets

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.540 
usually have it in Thomas trends corsets
where<00:03:06.980> it<00:03:07.220> has<00:03:07.430> two<00:03:08.110> layers<00:03:09.110> of<00:03:09.440> this<00:03:10.130> cotton

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
where it has two layers of this cotton

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.900 
where it has two layers of this cotton
twill<00:03:11.050> the<00:03:12.050> lining<00:03:12.770> that<00:03:13.070> you<00:03:13.190> see<00:03:13.400> here<00:03:13.730> and

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
twill the lining that you see here and

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.820 
twill the lining that you see here and
then<00:03:14.330> they<00:03:14.540> have<00:03:14.660> an<00:03:14.780> interlining<00:03:15.260> that<00:03:15.620> is

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
then they have an interlining that is

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.520 
then they have an interlining that is
directly<00:03:16.580> fused<00:03:17.060> to<00:03:17.390> the<00:03:17.420> fashion<00:03:17.989> fabric<00:03:18.350> and

directly fused to the fashion fabric and

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.500 
directly fused to the fashion fabric and
that's<00:03:18.680> why<00:03:18.950> these<00:03:19.430> corsets<00:03:19.880> typically<00:03:20.239> don't

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
that's why these corsets typically don't

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.060 
that's why these corsets typically don't
have<00:03:20.780> much<00:03:21.080> wrinkling<00:03:21.560> on<00:03:21.739> the<00:03:21.890> fashion

into quite a bit of fabric I would say

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.790 
into quite a bit of fabric I would say
is<00:06:38.949> at<00:06:39.910> least<00:06:40.120> four<00:06:40.599> maybe<00:06:40.840> six<00:06:40.990> layers<00:06:41.590> of

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:45.880 
they are single face satin so they're

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:47.370 
they are single face satin so they're
not<00:06:46.120> as<00:06:46.360> strong<00:06:46.599> as<00:06:46.720> double<00:06:46.990> faced<00:06:47.169> satin

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:51.490 
that I'm only achieving in this corset

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:53.790 
that I'm only achieving in this corset
then<00:06:51.639> it's<00:06:51.819> not<00:06:52.030> much<00:06:52.240> of<00:06:52.270> a<00:06:52.509> problem<00:06:52.780> it<00:06:53.259> is

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:53.800 
then it's not much of a problem it is

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.520 
then it's not much of a problem it is
pretty<00:06:54.099> closely<00:06:54.430> matching<00:06:55.180> to<00:06:55.720> the<00:06:56.139> nude

00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:59.460 
pretty closely matching to the nude
however<00:06:57.280> their<00:06:58.000> corsets<00:06:58.630> have<00:06:59.020> different
