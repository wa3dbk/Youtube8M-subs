00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.960
 otherwise what am I going to tell you 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.360
 now because I have done 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.760
 videos so there I do not know if you have 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.200
 noticed anyway so here is where 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.970
 it was the 14th of September the first 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.800
 video I did so it was before the 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.270
 official release of the game so I took 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.040
 risks I even took a strike 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.670
 for six months I can do more 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.470
 of 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.430
 custom miniatures finally here it is 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.340
 so I did as I took 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.350
 risks for and so since the release 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.840
 So here I have that 70 saw that I like 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.159
 at 15.70 seen it's still not bad but 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.310
 I also noticed for example yesterday 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.649
 I had 75 subscribers like that and that's it 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.440
 I am found at 63 so I see that 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.970
 people are good and just for 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.070
 watch the videos gt1 how it is 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.270
 so I find that a bit of a bit 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.490
 disgusting but good day but it's 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.720
 like those who stayed but one 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.650
 who is fighting to become so here is a 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.470
 you are connected 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.900

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:09.450

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:34.019

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.459

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:38.640
 see that what me is mike red so 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.140
 it's basically in English it's gong gong 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.239
 has already done that so that's how 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.180
 that one in English so if you want some 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.950

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.690
 just to do créac'h mike red I think 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.750
 that's what I did 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.420
 so once you write your gong 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.790

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.740

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.630
 choose the name chosen abbreviated or 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.320
 choose the color that appears very 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.730
 surely in the name gta online 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.260

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.670
 everyone to join you can 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.040

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.010
 the description you choose if you 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.270
 the balance after all that is the as marck 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.760
 and what does it mean exactly 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:22.500
 you do that but I do not have 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.030
 no need so there it is with respect to 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.880
 people who are in it so I have 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.540
