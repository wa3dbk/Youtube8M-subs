basic straightforward oil burner you
ever<00:00:23.670> came<00:00:24.000> across<00:00:24.300> as<00:00:24.810> you<00:00:25.019> can<00:00:25.199> see<00:00:25.470> it's<00:00:25.769> a

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
ever came across as you can see it's a

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.640 
ever came across as you can see it's a
bit<00:00:26.340> of<00:00:26.460> old<00:00:26.609> steel<00:00:27.119> exhaust<00:00:27.660> pipe<00:00:28.080> with<00:00:28.619> a

piece of copper tube stuck in the side

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.440 
piece of copper tube stuck in the side
you<00:00:31.439> can<00:00:31.619> see<00:00:31.859> where<00:00:32.070> I've<00:00:32.219> put<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:33.090> oil

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
you can see where I've put the oil

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.260 
you can see where I've put the oil
reservoir<00:00:33.840> up<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.739> top<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.340> feed<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.820> oil<00:00:36.000> in

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
reservoir up the top to feed the oil in

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.389 
reservoir up the top to feed the oil in
and<00:00:36.510> that<00:00:37.079> old<00:00:37.230> vacuum<00:00:37.710> cleaner<00:00:38.100> was

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
and that old vacuum cleaner was

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.310 
and that old vacuum cleaner was
supplying<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.120> air<00:00:39.300> through<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.780> bit<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.110> pool

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
supplying the air through a bit of pool

supplying the air through a bit of pool
hose<00:00:40.649> now<00:00:41.579> all<00:00:41.850> this<00:00:42.180> does<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.840> just<00:00:43.469> dribble

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
hose now all this does is just dribble

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.760 
hose now all this does is just dribble
the<00:00:44.190> oil<00:00:44.489> into<00:00:45.000> that<00:00:45.480> piece<00:00:45.809> of<00:00:46.050> pipe<00:00:46.289> through

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
the oil into that piece of pipe through

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.670 
the oil into that piece of pipe through
the<00:00:46.950> small<00:00:47.340> tube<00:00:47.730> what<00:00:48.480> I<00:00:48.510> did<00:00:48.870> here<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.379> get<00:00:49.559> it

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
the small tube what I did here to get it

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.930 
the small tube what I did here to get it
going<00:00:50.390> was<00:00:51.390> like<00:00:51.629> a<00:00:51.870> wood<00:00:52.140> fire<00:00:52.469> in<00:00:52.860> my<00:00:53.340> pizza

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
going was like a wood fire in my pizza

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.600 
going was like a wood fire in my pizza
oven<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.480> initially<00:00:55.289> I<00:00:55.320> was<00:00:55.649> using<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.460> the

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
oven and initially I was using to the

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.299 
oven and initially I was using to the
air<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:57.420> blow<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:58.050> wood<00:00:58.289> along<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:59.190> know

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
air to blow the wood along and you know

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.119 
air to blow the wood along and you know
get<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.789> fire<00:01:00.090> hot<00:01:00.120> this<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.170> actually<00:01:01.890> my

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
get the fire hot this is actually my

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.450 
get the fire hot this is actually my
very<00:01:02.190> first<00:01:02.699> oil<00:01:03.390> burner<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.830> very<00:01:05.129> first

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
very first oil burner and the very first

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.840 
very first oil burner and the very first
time<00:01:05.939> I<00:01:06.210> fired<00:01:06.570> one<00:01:06.810> up<00:01:07.200> this<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:08.040> this<00:01:08.400> is<00:01:08.670> the

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
time I fired one up this is this is the

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.910 
time I fired one up this is this is the
beginning<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.479> where<00:01:09.930> all<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.380> stupidity

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
beginning of where all the stupidity

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.960 
beginning of where all the stupidity
started<00:01:12.770> the<00:01:13.770> bricks<00:01:14.040> in<00:01:14.280> there<00:01:14.520> just

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
started the bricks in there just

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.590 
started the bricks in there just
basically<00:01:15.570> form<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.650> bit<00:01:17.280> of<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.580> cage<00:01:18.119> to

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
basically form a bit of a cage to

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.990 
basically form a bit of a cage to
contain<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.380> heat<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.860> if<00:01:20.460> you<00:01:20.610> know<00:01:20.759> how<00:01:20.970> a

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
contain the heat and if you know how a

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.960 
contain the heat and if you know how a
diesel<00:01:21.600> engine<00:01:22.080> works<00:01:22.320> it's<00:01:22.920> basically<00:01:23.610> a

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
diesel engine works it's basically a

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.870 
diesel engine works it's basically a
giant<00:01:24.479> globe<00:01:24.990> plug<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:25.920> must<00:01:26.250> have<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.549> hot

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
giant globe plug you must have a hot

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.410 
giant globe plug you must have a hot
surface<00:01:27.210> for<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.200> oil<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:29.130> change<00:01:29.729> from<00:01:30.150> a

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
surface for the oil to change from a

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.410 
surface for the oil to change from a
liquid<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.170> vapor<00:01:31.320> it<00:01:32.250> won't<00:01:32.610> burn<00:01:32.909> as<00:01:33.390> a

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
liquid to a vapor it won't burn as a

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.050 
liquid to a vapor it won't burn as a
liquid<00:01:34.020> it<00:01:34.259> must<00:01:34.829> get<00:01:35.189> hot<00:01:35.520> enough<00:01:35.759> to

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
liquid it must get hot enough to

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.840 
liquid it must get hot enough to
vaporize<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.229> gas<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:37.950> then<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:38.640> can

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
vaporize to a gas and then you can

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.080 
vaporize to a gas and then you can
ignite<00:01:39.210> it<00:01:39.479> off<00:01:40.189> what's<00:01:41.189> happening<00:01:41.610> here<00:01:41.850> is

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
ignite it off what's happening here is

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.510 
ignite it off what's happening here is
I'm<00:01:42.479> using<00:01:42.720> a<00:01:43.020> brick<00:01:43.320> at<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.590> back<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.100> just

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
I'm using a brick at the back and just

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.870 
I'm using a brick at the back and just
basically<00:01:45.149> bouncing<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.259> oil<00:01:46.560> fuel<00:01:47.159> mixture

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
basically bouncing the oil fuel mixture

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.719 
basically bouncing the oil fuel mixture
off<00:01:48.030> oil<00:01:48.350> air<00:01:49.350> mixture<00:01:49.890> I<00:01:49.920> should<00:01:50.220> say<00:01:50.460> off

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
off oil air mixture I should say off

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.990 
off oil air mixture I should say off
those<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.890> allowing<00:01:52.890> it<00:01:53.009> to<00:01:53.070> escape<00:01:53.670> through

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
those and allowing it to escape through

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.270 
those and allowing it to escape through
the<00:01:54.030> holes<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:55.020> holes<00:01:55.259> in<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.680> bricks<00:01:55.950> work

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
the holes the holes in the bricks work

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.730 
the holes the holes in the bricks work
like<00:01:56.549> heat<00:01:56.790> exchangers<00:01:57.780> because<00:01:58.409> they<00:01:58.590> will

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
like heat exchangers because they will

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.609 
like heat exchangers because they will
allow<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.130> peak<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.210> go<00:02:00.420> through<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.110> then

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
allow the peak to go through and then

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.310 
allow the peak to go through and then
they<00:02:01.950> will<00:02:02.130> radiate<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:03.030> heat

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
they will radiate the heat

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.860 
they will radiate the heat
back<00:02:03.530> to<00:02:03.890> any<00:02:04.160> further<00:02:04.550> incoming<00:02:05.420> air<00:02:05.600> and

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.870 
back to any further incoming air and

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.219 
back to any further incoming air and
ignite<00:02:06.770> that<00:02:06.800> off<00:02:07.280> once<00:02:08.149> again<00:02:08.390> there<00:02:09.020> is<00:02:09.050> no

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
ignite that off once again there is no

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.650 
ignite that off once again there is no
jets<00:02:10.070> there<00:02:10.580> is<00:02:11.020> no<00:02:12.020> sort<00:02:12.590> of<00:02:13.480> valves<00:02:14.480> or

trickles<00:02:23.030> in<00:02:23.270> the<00:02:23.420> small<00:02:23.840> line<00:02:24.260> and<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:25.160> air

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
trickles in the small line and the air

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.690 
trickles in the small line and the air
forces<00:02:26.600> it<00:02:26.750> out<00:02:26.960> blows<00:02:27.500> it<00:02:27.800> out<00:02:27.950> the<00:02:28.220> end<00:02:28.400> there

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
forces it out blows it out the end there

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.380 
forces it out blows it out the end there
it<00:02:29.210> hits<00:02:29.450> the<00:02:29.750> bricks<00:02:30.050> it<00:02:30.500> vaporizes<00:02:31.390> ignites

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
it hits the bricks it vaporizes ignites

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.020 
it hits the bricks it vaporizes ignites
and<00:02:32.750> obviously<00:02:33.710> the<00:02:34.010> air<00:02:34.160> supplies<00:02:34.730> the

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
and obviously the air supplies the

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.090 
and obviously the air supplies the
oxygen<00:02:35.600> for<00:02:35.810> combustion<00:02:36.260> it's<00:02:37.070> that<00:02:37.700> simple

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
oxygen for combustion it's that simple

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.280 
oxygen for combustion it's that simple
now<00:02:40.100> wouldn't<00:02:41.000> be<00:02:41.090> one<00:02:41.240> of<00:02:41.360> my<00:02:41.480> videos<00:02:41.900> they

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
now wouldn't be one of my videos they

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.280 
now wouldn't be one of my videos they
have<00:02:42.320> a<00:02:42.470> safety<00:02:43.010> kit<00:02:43.220> to<00:02:43.610> compete<00:02:44.600> to<00:02:44.810> keep<00:02:45.050> the

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
have a safety kit to compete to keep the

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.250 
have a safety kit to compete to keep the
idiots<00:02:46.010> and<00:02:46.250> morons<00:02:46.490> alive<00:02:47.240> what<00:02:47.930> the<00:02:48.080> hell

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
idiots and morons alive what the hell

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.110 
idiots and morons alive what the hell
they're<00:02:48.470> doing<00:02:48.500> even<00:02:49.100> looking<00:02:49.459> at<00:02:49.550> this<00:02:49.730> and

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
they're doing even looking at this and

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.940 
they're doing even looking at this and
thinking<00:02:50.570> about<00:02:50.690> it<00:02:51.020> I<00:02:51.200> don't<00:02:51.260> know<00:02:51.650> but

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
thinking about it I don't know but

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.010 
thinking about it I don't know but
today's<00:02:52.520> safety<00:02:52.970> clip<00:02:53.450> is<00:02:53.630> really

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
today's safety clip is really

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.990 
today's safety clip is really
straightforward<00:02:54.590> and<00:02:55.250> you've<00:02:55.670> probably

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
straightforward and you've probably

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.360 
straightforward and you've probably
heard<00:02:56.300> your<00:02:56.570> mother<00:02:56.750> tell<00:02:57.080> you<00:02:57.290> already<00:02:57.560> don't

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
if it's an oil-fired oven because if you

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.509 
if it's an oil-fired oven because if you
do<00:03:05.180> I<00:03:05.450> don't<00:03:05.870> even<00:03:05.989> have<00:03:06.290> to<00:03:06.500> explain<00:03:06.650> wine

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519

just<00:03:15.620> don't<00:03:15.980> do<00:03:16.280> it<00:03:17.140> these<00:03:18.140> things<00:03:18.560> are<00:03:18.799> just

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
just don't do it these things are just

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.729 
just don't do it these things are just
so<00:03:19.280> easy<00:03:19.310> you<00:03:20.150> can<00:03:20.180> put<00:03:20.720> it<00:03:20.840> in<00:03:20.989> something<00:03:21.320> like

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
so easy you can put it in something like

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.460 
so easy you can put it in something like
this<00:03:22.040> is<00:03:22.340> if<00:03:22.610> you<00:03:22.760> are<00:03:22.790> doing<00:03:22.910> a<00:03:23.269> furnace<00:03:23.810> or<00:03:24.140> as

this is if you are doing a furnace or as
you<00:03:24.620> can<00:03:24.769> see<00:03:25.010> in<00:03:25.190> some<00:03:25.459> of<00:03:25.610> my<00:03:25.760> other<00:03:25.940> videos

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
you can see in some of my other videos

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.870 
you can see in some of my other videos
the<00:03:26.959> next<00:03:27.290> stage<00:03:27.560> or<00:03:27.860> use<00:03:28.100> this<00:03:28.370> thing<00:03:28.700> was

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
the next stage or use this thing was

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.880 
the next stage or use this thing was
just<00:03:28.910> the<00:03:29.360> caca<00:03:29.660> hole<00:03:29.959> in<00:03:30.260> a<00:03:30.350> metal<00:03:30.680> bucket

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
just the caca hole in a metal bucket

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.610 
just the caca hole in a metal bucket
shove<00:03:31.670> it<00:03:31.820> in<00:03:31.910> the<00:03:32.060> side<00:03:32.330> and<00:03:32.750> it<00:03:33.110> worked<00:03:33.350> just

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
shove it in the side and it worked just

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.160 
shove it in the side and it worked just
spying<00:03:34.040> from<00:03:34.459> there<00:03:34.700> I<00:03:35.000> move<00:03:35.600> this<00:03:35.930> around

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
spying from there I move this around

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.229 
spying from there I move this around
here<00:03:36.739> you<00:03:36.950> can<00:03:37.130> see<00:03:37.370> I'm<00:03:37.549> aiming<00:03:37.910> it<00:03:38.030> at<00:03:38.120> the

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
here you can see I'm aiming it at the

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.720 
here you can see I'm aiming it at the
corner<00:03:38.540> now<00:03:38.900> because<00:03:39.350> I<00:03:39.470> had<00:03:39.650> enough<00:03:39.920> heat<00:03:40.489> in

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
corner now because I had enough heat in

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.080 
corner now because I had enough heat in
there<00:03:40.970> just<00:03:41.239> to<00:03:41.480> light<00:03:41.720> it<00:03:41.959> off<00:03:42.140> and<00:03:42.730> it<00:03:43.730> really

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.090 
there just to light it off and it really

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.990 
there just to light it off and it really
did<00:03:44.420> work<00:03:45.110> well<00:03:45.440> no<00:03:45.709> matter<00:03:45.920> what<00:03:46.040> where<00:03:46.459> I<00:03:46.489> put

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
did work well no matter what where I put

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.050 
did work well no matter what where I put
it<00:03:47.120> that<00:03:47.870> is<00:03:48.110> a<00:03:48.140> real<00:03:48.500> true<00:03:48.920> indication<00:03:49.430> of<00:03:49.790> how

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
it that is a real true indication of how

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.300 
it that is a real true indication of how
hot<00:03:50.450> it<00:03:50.660> was<00:03:50.690> in<00:03:51.110> there<00:03:51.290> those<00:03:51.560> bricks<00:03:52.040> were

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
hot it was in there those bricks were

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.510 
hot it was in there those bricks were
absolutely

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 
absolutely

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.230 
absolutely
in<00:03:53.610> red<00:03:54.380> you<00:03:55.380> can<00:03:55.530> also<00:03:55.680> see<00:03:56.160> the<00:03:56.340> cold<00:03:56.610> center

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 
in red you can also see the cold center

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.900 
in red you can also see the cold center
spot<00:03:57.570> where<00:03:58.110> the<00:03:58.380> air<00:03:58.710> is<00:03:59.010> actually<00:03:59.190> cooling

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
spot where the air is actually cooling

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.210 
spot where the air is actually cooling
that<00:04:00.300> part<00:04:00.630> of<00:04:00.810> the<00:04:00.900> brick<00:04:01.170> but<00:04:01.620> as<00:04:01.740> it<00:04:01.920> blows

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
that part of the brick but as it blows

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.970 
that part of the brick but as it blows
off<00:04:02.580> and<00:04:02.880> the<00:04:03.030> oil<00:04:03.270> carries<00:04:03.780> with<00:04:04.050> it<00:04:04.080> it<00:04:04.530> just

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
off and the oil carries with it it just

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.940 
off and the oil carries with it it just
lights<00:04:05.280> up<00:04:05.610> and<00:04:05.820> that's<00:04:06.000> it<00:04:06.300> so<00:04:07.050> that's<00:04:07.680> the

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
lights up and that's it so that's the

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.390 
lights up and that's it so that's the
shutdown<00:04:08.520> of<00:04:08.550> it<00:04:09.410> gives<00:04:10.410> you<00:04:10.530> an<00:04:10.680> idea<00:04:11.160> where

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
shutdown of it gives you an idea where

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.430 
shutdown of it gives you an idea where
you<00:04:11.430> can<00:04:11.700> see<00:04:11.940> the<00:04:12.150> outside<00:04:12.330> and<00:04:13.050> the<00:04:13.410> inside

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
you can see the outside and the inside

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.970 
you can see the outside and the inside
just<00:04:14.220> how<00:04:14.700> hot<00:04:15.030> those<00:04:15.300> bricks<00:04:15.690> work<00:04:16.020> that<00:04:16.770> is

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
just how hot those bricks work that is

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.340 
just how hot those bricks work that is
my<00:04:17.220> wood<00:04:17.430> fire<00:04:17.700> pizza<00:04:17.880> oven<00:04:18.360> and<00:04:18.840> there<00:04:19.200> is

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:19.350 
my wood fire pizza oven and there is

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.680 
my wood fire pizza oven and there is
over<00:04:19.560> a<00:04:19.799> ton<00:04:20.160> of<00:04:20.190> bricks<00:04:20.580> in<00:04:20.820> there<00:04:21.030> so<00:04:21.510> you've

make an oil burn or as simple as that
you<00:04:36.690> don't<00:04:36.900> need<00:04:37.080> to<00:04:37.320> know<00:04:37.470> dimensions

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
you don't need to know dimensions

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.790 
you don't need to know dimensions
measurements<00:04:39.030> or<00:04:39.180> anything<00:04:39.450> else<00:04:39.810> feed<00:04:40.500> a<00:04:40.530> bit

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
measurements or anything else feed a bit

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.430 
measurements or anything else feed a bit
of<00:04:40.920> oil<00:04:41.070> into<00:04:41.430> a<00:04:41.550> tube<00:04:41.970> a<00:04:42.270> mat<00:04:42.810> it's<00:04:42.990> something

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
of oil into a tube a mat it's something

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.490 
of oil into a tube a mat it's something
that<00:04:43.590> will<00:04:43.710> get<00:04:43.890> real<00:04:44.190> hot<00:04:44.550> and<00:04:44.790> you<00:04:45.600> know<00:04:45.750> burn

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.500 
that will get real hot and you know burn

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.180 
that will get real hot and you know burn
away<00:04:46.830> it's<00:04:47.400> it's<00:04:47.820> that<00:04:47.960> simple<00:04:48.960> so<00:04:49.770> hopefully

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190
