00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.080 
preference that's that's what I
definitely<00:02:16.040> just<00:02:16.310> try<00:02:16.549> out<00:02:16.670> a<00:02:16.730> bunch<00:02:16.969> of

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
definitely just try out a bunch of

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.699 
definitely just try out a bunch of
brushes<00:02:17.480> you<00:02:17.719> know<00:02:17.810> I<00:02:17.840> started<00:02:18.260> out<00:02:18.409> with<00:02:18.590> the

00:02:18.699 --> 00:02:18.709 
brushes you know I started out with the

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.080 
brushes you know I started out with the
whole<00:02:18.890> bunch<00:02:19.159> of<00:02:19.280> brushes<00:02:19.519> I<00:02:19.700> had<00:02:19.819> this<00:02:19.909> whole

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
whole bunch of brushes I had this whole

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.550 
whole bunch of brushes I had this whole
set<00:02:20.390> of<00:02:20.480> brushes<00:02:20.659> and<00:02:21.730> then<00:02:22.900> after<00:02:23.900> doing<00:02:24.319> a

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
set of brushes and then after doing a

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.890 
set of brushes and then after doing a
few<00:02:24.739> pieces<00:02:24.950> after<00:02:25.730> months<00:02:26.209> of<00:02:26.299> painting<00:02:26.719> I

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
few pieces after months of painting I

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.500 
few pieces after months of painting I
realized<00:02:27.709> I<00:02:27.890> was<00:02:28.010> only<00:02:28.159> using<00:02:28.489> these<00:02:29.090> few

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
realized I was only using these few

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.380 
realized I was only using these few
brushes<00:02:30.010> so<00:02:31.010> I<00:02:31.340> just<00:02:31.670> set<00:02:31.849> the<00:02:31.970> other<00:02:32.090> ones<00:02:32.269> to

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
brushes so I just set the other ones to

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.420 
brushes so I just set the other ones to
the<00:02:32.510> side<00:02:32.720> and<00:02:33.109> just<00:02:33.590> kept<00:02:33.739> using<00:02:33.920> these<00:02:34.189> and

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
the side and just kept using these and

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.460 
the side and just kept using these and
just<00:02:34.549> narrowed<00:02:34.879> it<00:02:34.970> down<00:02:35.000> even<00:02:35.390> more<00:02:35.420> and<00:02:35.840> now

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
just narrowed it down even more and now

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.949 
just narrowed it down even more and now
that's<00:02:36.769> my<00:02:37.010> set<00:02:37.280> that<00:02:37.459> I<00:02:37.489> use<00:02:37.730> that's<00:02:38.030> it<00:02:38.299> right

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
that's my set that I use that's it right

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:40.660 
that's my set that I use that's it right
there<00:02:38.989> and<00:02:39.739> it's<00:02:40.010> just<00:02:40.129> personal<00:02:40.459> preference

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
there and it's just personal preference

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.149 
there and it's just personal preference
because<00:02:40.909> I've<00:02:41.120> read<00:02:41.329> books<00:02:42.139> by<00:02:42.349> other<00:02:42.620> artists

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:43.159 
because I've read books by other artists

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:46.420 
because I've read books by other artists
that<00:02:43.280> say<00:02:43.939> oh<00:02:43.969> we<00:02:44.359> use<00:02:44.540> these<00:02:44.810> brushes<00:02:45.129> but<00:02:46.129> I

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
that say oh we use these brushes but I

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.550 
that say oh we use these brushes but I
can<00:02:47.239> do<00:02:47.389> their<00:02:47.569> paintings<00:02:47.989> with<00:02:48.170> my<00:02:48.290> brushes

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
can do their paintings with my brushes

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.429 
can do their paintings with my brushes
so<00:02:49.040> it<00:02:49.400> doesn't<00:02:49.700> matter<00:02:49.840> the<00:02:50.840> most<00:02:51.049> important

00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:51.439 
so it doesn't matter the most important

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:54.220 
so it doesn't matter the most important
thing<00:02:51.560> is<00:02:51.739> to<00:02:51.980> be<00:02:52.129> your<00:02:52.280> own<00:02:52.459> artist<00:02:53.000> and<00:02:53.239> do

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
thing is to be your own artist and do

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.020 
thing is to be your own artist and do
what<00:02:54.409> feels<00:02:54.650> right<00:02:54.739> to<00:02:54.889> you<00:02:55.159> because<00:02:55.849> that's

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
what feels right to you because that's

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.720 
what feels right to you because that's
the<00:02:56.150> whole<00:02:56.329> point<00:02:56.689> about<00:02:56.959> being<00:02:57.319> an<00:02:57.409> artist

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
the whole point about being an artist

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.860 
the whole point about being an artist
and<00:02:58.730> I'm<00:02:58.849> going<00:02:59.030> to<00:02:59.060> make<00:02:59.359> another<00:02:59.629> video

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
and I'm going to make another video

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.170 
and I'm going to make another video

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
about this because you should be

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.470 
about this because you should be
independent<00:03:02.569> you<00:03:02.930> should<00:03:03.139> be<00:03:03.400> yourself<00:03:04.480> you

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
independent you should be yourself you

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.940

other people you know I got a lot of

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:14.740 
other people you know I got a lot of
inspiration<00:03:13.459> from<00:03:13.879> other<00:03:14.180> artists<00:03:14.599> that<00:03:14.720> I

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
inspiration from other artists that I

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.259 
inspiration from other artists that I
liked<00:03:15.109> and<00:03:15.379> I<00:03:15.919> was<00:03:16.340> painting<00:03:16.579> a<00:03:16.730> lot<00:03:16.909> like<00:03:17.090> them

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
but I've also done many pieces where it

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.780 
but I've also done many pieces where it
was<00:03:20.720> what<00:03:20.930> I<00:03:20.959> wanted<00:03:21.260> to<00:03:21.530> paint<00:03:21.739> and<00:03:21.979> I<00:03:22.519> wasn't

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
was what I wanted to paint and I wasn't

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.399 
was what I wanted to paint and I wasn't
scared<00:03:23.000> to<00:03:23.299> paint<00:03:23.540> it<00:03:23.659> and<00:03:23.810> I<00:03:23.840> didn't<00:03:24.290> care

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:24.409 
scared to paint it and I didn't care

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:26.710 
scared to paint it and I didn't care
what<00:03:24.590> anyone<00:03:24.799> else<00:03:24.889> thought<00:03:25.569> and<00:03:26.569> I<00:03:26.659> think

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
what anyone else thought and I think

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.089 
what anyone else thought and I think
it's<00:03:26.989> important<00:03:27.409> for<00:03:27.530> being<00:03:27.620> an<00:03:27.769> artist

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:28.099 
it's important for being an artist

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:30.699 
it's important for being an artist
because<00:03:28.370> a<00:03:28.669> lot<00:03:29.479> of<00:03:29.599> people<00:03:29.840> are<00:03:30.019> scared<00:03:30.440> to<00:03:30.590> do

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
because a lot of people are scared to do

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.199 
because a lot of people are scared to do
that<00:03:30.889> they're<00:03:31.010> scared<00:03:31.340> to<00:03:31.459> be<00:03:31.639> their<00:03:32.000> own

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
that they're scared to be their own
