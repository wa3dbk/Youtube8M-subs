video<00:00:21.570> I<00:00:21.660> would<00:00:21.840> be<00:00:22.310> comparing<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.550> google

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
video I would be comparing the google

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.720 
video I would be comparing the google
nexus<00:00:24.210> 7<00:00:24.840> with<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.260> samsung<00:00:25.740> galaxy<00:00:26.250> note<00:00:26.430> 2

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
nexus 7 with the samsung galaxy note 2

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.599 
nexus 7 with the samsung galaxy note 2
now<00:00:27.689> most<00:00:28.529> people<00:00:28.650> would<00:00:29.070> say<00:00:29.099> there<00:00:29.460> is<00:00:29.580> no

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
now most people would say there is no

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.620 
now most people would say there is no
point<00:00:30.090> in<00:00:30.359> comparing<00:00:30.750> these<00:00:31.080> two<00:00:31.140> because<00:00:31.769> the

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:32.630 
point in comparing these two because the

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.990 
point in comparing these two because the
Nexus<00:00:33.630> 7<00:00:34.050> is<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.260> tablet<00:00:35.010> while<00:00:35.309> that<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.790> a

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
Nexus 7 is a tablet while that is a

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.780 
Nexus 7 is a tablet while that is a
smartphone<00:00:36.660> but<00:00:36.960> then<00:00:37.350> again<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:37.860> have<00:00:38.730> a

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
smartphone but then again you have a

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.569 
smartphone but then again you have a
7-inch<00:00:39.390> screen<00:00:39.570> over<00:00:40.020> here<00:00:40.050> and<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.530> 5.5<00:00:41.280> inch

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
7-inch screen over here and a 5.5 inch

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.880 
7-inch screen over here and a 5.5 inch
screen<00:00:41.879> over<00:00:42.149> there<00:00:42.360> so<00:00:43.079> we're<00:00:43.320> not<00:00:43.590> too<00:00:43.860> far

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
screen over there so we're not too far

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.400 
screen over there so we're not too far
from<00:00:44.489> in<00:00:44.969> terms<00:00:45.629> of<00:00:45.930> screen<00:00:46.289> size<00:00:46.559> but

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
from in terms of screen size but

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.650 
from in terms of screen size but
generally<00:00:49.410> we<00:00:49.620> are<00:00:49.800> pretty<00:00:50.129> close<00:00:50.300> so<00:00:51.300> i'll

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
generally we are pretty close so i'll

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.549 
generally we are pretty close so i'll
just<00:00:51.690> quickly<00:00:52.110> do<00:00:53.809> do<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.840> comparison<00:00:55.379> between

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
just quickly do do a comparison between

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.180 
just quickly do do a comparison between

gigahertz<00:02:48.459> cortex<00:02:49.330> a9<00:02:49.780> why<00:02:50.170> this<00:02:50.230> is<00:02:51.209> 1.6

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:52.209 
gigahertz cortex a9 why this is 1.6

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.220 
gigahertz cortex a9 why this is 1.6
gigahertz<00:02:52.600> so<00:02:54.480> that<00:02:55.480> should<00:02:55.720> give<00:02:55.900> you<00:02:56.050> the

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
gigahertz so that should give you the

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.610 
gigahertz so that should give you the
idea<00:02:56.350> about<00:02:56.739> how<00:02:57.100> fast<00:02:57.459> these<00:02:57.760> devices<00:02:58.330> and

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.670 

most<00:03:02.620> of<00:03:02.860> the<00:03:03.010> thing<00:03:03.870> most<00:03:04.870> of<00:03:05.140> the<00:03:05.260> stuff<00:03:05.530> is

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
most of the thing most of the stuff is

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.300 
most of the thing most of the stuff is
pretty<00:03:05.890> much<00:03:06.190> the<00:03:06.640> same<00:03:07.030> I<00:03:07.269> mean<00:03:08.280> Samsung<00:03:09.280> has

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
pretty much the same I mean Samsung has

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.520 
pretty much the same I mean Samsung has
their<00:03:09.730> touch<00:03:10.030> with<00:03:10.239> you<00:03:10.420> I<00:03:10.450> going<00:03:10.989> on<00:03:11.140> here

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
their touch with you I going on here

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.880 
their touch with you I going on here
while<00:03:12.100> Google<00:03:12.459> has<00:03:12.819> their<00:03:13.200> native<00:03:14.200> Android<00:03:14.709> UI

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
while Google has their native Android UI

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.759 
while Google has their native Android UI
so<00:03:15.790> that<00:03:16.150> is<00:03:16.329> a<00:03:16.360> huge<00:03:16.570> difference<00:03:16.900> and<00:03:17.290> now<00:03:17.590> in

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
so that is a huge difference and now in

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.520 
so that is a huge difference and now in
terms<00:03:18.010> of<00:03:18.280> apps<00:03:18.549> all<00:03:19.540> the<00:03:19.810> apps<00:03:19.959> you<00:03:20.140> can<00:03:20.200> run

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
terms of apps all the apps you can run

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.430 
terms of apps all the apps you can run
here<00:03:20.920> at<00:03:21.310> the<00:03:21.519> same<00:03:21.760> exact<00:03:22.600> apps<00:03:22.840> you<00:03:23.079> can<00:03:23.140> run

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
here at the same exact apps you can run

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.660 
here at the same exact apps you can run
on<00:03:23.650> your<00:03:23.799> google<00:03:24.250> nexus<00:03:24.280> 7<00:03:25.709> now<00:03:26.709> the<00:03:27.430> main

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
on your google nexus 7 now the main

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.759 
on your google nexus 7 now the main
difference<00:03:27.700> i'd<00:03:28.450> say<00:03:28.720> is<00:03:28.959> the<00:03:29.170> screen<00:03:29.530> size

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
difference i'd say is the screen size

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:34.740 
difference i'd say is the screen size
because<00:03:30.630> many<00:03:31.630> people<00:03:32.850> cannot<00:03:33.850> use<00:03:34.180> this<00:03:34.390> as<00:03:34.690> a

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
because many people cannot use this as a

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.720 
because many people cannot use this as a
tablet<00:03:35.739> i<00:03:36.190> mean<00:03:36.400> it<00:03:36.640> is<00:03:36.820> pretty<00:03:37.120> big<00:03:37.420> and<00:03:38.730> pen
