00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 among Russian car owners a lot 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.390
 fans 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.770
 diesel cars 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.150
 really well tuned engine with 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.610
 compression ignition 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.870
 has a considerable advantage over its 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.630
 petrol counterparts 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.820
 but what if diesel starts with 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.970
 great difficulty what should be paid 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.970
 Attention 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.810
 feature of diesel engines is 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.880
 high enough crank turns 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.410
 shafts that are needed for sure 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.939
 launch 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.910
 if a gasoline engine for example 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.460
 just spin at 60 80 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.489
 revolutions per minute then 10 you need to rotate 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.410
 at least twice as fast, and so 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.329
 diesel starter and battery 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.670
 the car should always be full 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.289
 ok especially in winter otherwise mix 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.200
 cylinders are simply not 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.239
 ignite attach starter job 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.980
 worth paying attention to fat 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.270
 wire that connects the motor 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.250
 car body bad contact on 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.989
 mass may be caused by weakening 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.210
 fastener 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.670
 surface oxidation or ingress 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.299
 paint under the terminal when painting the body 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.040
 at the factory, stripping contacts and tightening 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.760
 fastener contributes to normal operation 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.330
 starter for sure start in the cold 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.340
 paramount importance 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.439
 cylinder-piston group with good 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.850
 compression 10 starts instantly 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.310
 literally half a turn 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.420
 and only severe cold at temperatures 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.450
 below -30 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.220
 sometimes scrolling a little longer 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.759
 if the motor is worn out then you definitely 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.689
 will suffer with a cold start in 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.150
 frosty weather 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.329
 use this threefold technique 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.149
 heating glow plugs included 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.670
 Ignition wait until the yellow light 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.009
 with a spiral goes out and then returned 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.409
 Key to its original position 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:54.869
 then immediately without pause , turn on again 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.719
 ignition and wait for shutdown 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.149
 light bulbs and only from the third time after 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:03.000
 start warming up the candles 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.969
 engine start checked more than once this 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.320
 method really helps don't be afraid 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.780
 for glow plugs 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.870
 if the time relay works fine with 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.590
 candles nothing bad will happen and yet 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.870
 easy 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.030
 descent of cold diesel in many ways 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.890
 depends on the quality of fuel poured into 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.090
 tank 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.010
 thickened diesel fuel bad 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.830
 pumped through filters either not 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.480
 go through them altogether try 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.030
 refuel only on proven 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.090
 branded with which there is no bad 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.989
 fame 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.670
 common problem with diesel 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.160
 is not fuel tightness 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.319
 only a small highway 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.989
 leaks in order to arise suction 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:46.410
 air inside the fuel system and then 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:48.420
 it is impossible to start the engine sometimes 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.459
 fuel from pipelines can drain 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.470
 back to the tank due to a malfunction 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.739
 ball valve which should 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.370
 work on the nipple principle 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:59.060
 significant role in immaculate 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:02.160
 start-up of the motor play injection nozzles 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.970
 when their sprayers are worn or 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.430
 polluted 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.329
 air and fuel will never mix in 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.150
 right proportion 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:12.120
 if the nozzles are not sprayed with fuel but how 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.200
 horrible pour motor will troit shake 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.470
 and bad news 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.329
 without spending fuel problems with 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:22.620
 starting in this situation will also be 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:24.329
 especially in the cold I listed the most 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.829
 common problems characteristic of both 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.519
 domestic so for imported 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.920
 cars 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:31.380
 to be on duty and drive without worries 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.359
 you need to take care of diesel with young 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.180
 refueling it with good fuel and 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:37.739
 timely service is important 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.579
 also choose the right brand 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.780
 car and 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:44.609
 engine model eg motor about m 646 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.130
 famous for its stamina and 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:49.650
 unpretentiousness by the way 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.389
 equipped with these engines vans and 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.430
 vans sprinter classic 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:57.900
 one of the few for now 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:59.700
 the same pre-crisis prices remain 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.040
 that 's another story 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:05.780
 I wish you perfect work motor 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.780
 backed up by a confident launch
