00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.089
 the first-time gardener who 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.839
 want to build an orchard in the yard 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.180
 From home 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.189
 or who knows how to plant a tree in the 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.800
 sidewalk that is beautiful produces a 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.080
 pleasant shade and still bear fruit in 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.590
 profusion my tip one only invest 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.590
 in the blackberry 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.270
 on today's show I'll tell you everything 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.489
 about this fruit that is 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.649
 station to teach a very 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.440
 of blackberry jam that gives 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:46.410
 such a quantity is impossible to eat 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:48.989
 all at once love is a tree of 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.800
 family of the same as the fig and 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.840
 of jaca 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.750
 it comes from china and was introduced in 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.000
 Brazil in the 17th century adapted so well 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.859
 here it grows spontaneously 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.750
 in any type of soil 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.609
 this tree here for example you can 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.010
 I can not believe it but I could not take it. 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.290
 she was born alone in the delicium orchard to 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.720
 moreira prefers well fertilized soils and 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.479
 deep but she's so shameless 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.159
 it grows even in dry soils and 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.159
 very low fertility 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.990
 fashion is on the right spot when you have 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:26.150
 black or at least dark red and 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.000
 never take the floor she already has 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.790
 It is not very tiring every hour that the 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.890
 people eat is a set of dozens of 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.759
 small fruits that we call 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.630
 truffle or fruit essence blackberry is 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.299
 more common 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.360
 but this one also this variety blackberry 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:47.720
 is more expensive that the pulp is well 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.939
 Firm is more delicious to eat natura 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.130
 from the economic point of view the 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:54.170
 importance is on the leaves that are 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:02:03.830
 widely used as food for 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:06.200
 silkworm caterpillars the ingredients 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.580
 Classics of jelly are the fruits themselves 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.200
 and sugar 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.540
 Ideally, the sugar should be of the 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.670
 crystal that thicker 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.890
 after placing the blackberries in the pan 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.500
 you add some water half 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:22.940
 cup lid and let the fire very low 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.920
 for approximately half an hour when the 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.680
 works are well-cooked 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.680
 You can love rooms a little. 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.680
 gently 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.230
 the sugar has to be placed with this 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.050
 syrup still very wet 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:42.280
 the proportion is always half of the 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.280
 amount of fruit 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:49.940
 my tip is to not let it dry too 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:52.840
 fire because after that would be the jelly 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.840
 they attend thick ' 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.230
 watching well in the refrigerator you will have 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.880
 the taste of love all year round in your house 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.650
 but let's agree 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.650
 It will be difficult to last so long.
