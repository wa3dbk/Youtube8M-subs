00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 yes but a composer and musician here 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:09.950
 live on the most important stage 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.950
 juvenile de monterrey is in itself 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:16.720
 this song 

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:19.550
 that song is called boomerang 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.840
 remember what for me 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.340
 it means 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:29.340
 you find the love of your life and then you 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.340
 you separate and return them what is always 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.400
 the mechanics of love is like that of a 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.470
 Boomerang 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.530
 when you lie on the air and you see that 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.420
 goes because even if it's the wettest afternoon 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.110
 you know that if you did it right it's going to 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.150
 to return 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.610
 the person that is for you will be though 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:50.070
 Remove the one that does not, even if it gets more 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.260
 at once it's not about you wanting 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.180
 or need it just that it's not chance 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.670
 and the days that have a month things 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.710
 they go through something and that's why they have value 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.410
 that goes up has to come down one day from the 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.390
 nothing very similar happen in love 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.280
 the day you know you found the 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.770
 right person to separate you from someone 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.200
 which is for you is suicidal because in 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.720
 your departure will leave your warmth not only 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.400
 It happens when it's the love of your life but 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.990
 also when she is the one who gives life to 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.610
 his love 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.080
 t 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:24.210
 in the same place where yesterday exists or not 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.190
 you told me 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.190
 and I see again 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.170
 Y 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.210
 and me 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.910
 If you have not understood, you can leave another 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.370
 you're going to end up in the same place 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:57.070
 your heels standing next to my 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.870
 shoes and your dressed in white in front 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.760
 of a high is to find this 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.680
 person is like taking a luxury one 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.990
 mathematical fifty and fifty go 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.330
 a hundred some believe it's a kind of 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.399
 I bewitch the ingredients the hearts 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.800
 that they understand each other well it's not about 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.290
 who but how is it changing the 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.360
 cloudy sky for one for stars and the 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.370
 only way to check it is 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.400
 when the physical is more beautiful than 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:23.800
 you see in it and I saw you like that if I bought it 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.350
 Enough you look beautiful for any 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.840
 occasion I will answer your question how 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.140
 I notice this when I saw that your mouth was 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.140
 my vocation 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.700
 do not 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.040
 single 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.650
 all right 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.900
 well if I go back and I think that 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:04.560
 I present my friend fallero 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.010
 religion and in that song it's called 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.010
 Boomerang 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.420
 with
