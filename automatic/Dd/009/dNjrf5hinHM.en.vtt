00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:05.569
 very good people here you have the last 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.210
 part of the trànsit guide in which 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:10.550
 he came to round 70 and I'm going to show you 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.110
 a couple of fragments like that in which I 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.520
 I move around the map because I really 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.890
 strategy and you know ya 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.510
 explain in the tutorial how to use 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.030
 10 wins and you can see that the 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.280
 strategy that's the state 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:26.060
 outside of farm go killing little by little and 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:28.220
 There is not much to do but good 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.350
 it was pending to raise it had there the 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.149
 video of round 70 and how I was 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:34.190
 linked with the tutorial theme and everything 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:37.399
 that I could not upload it and here the 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.930
 you have good there they killed me and I left 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.690
 I went with this transport the truth is that 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.489
 a bit risky because that went into 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.680
 Round 64 is not convenient to do 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:49.550
 but hey I did he sent me here he takes me 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:52.910
 I picked up the winter bits that I was missing and 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.649
 here endure endurance the round is worth 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.180
 was killing here you have to kill with a lot 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:58.760
 careful because there are all the answers 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.649
 sites and it has nothing to do with 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.989
 comparison with farm in farms to see 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:04.369
 you know there are only five respawn and only 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.470
 you have to have them controlled already 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:08.300
 so nothing here I had to kill very 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.400
 Little by little , I got pretty 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.750
 and quite heavy the piece of this 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.060
 because I did not want to go back without 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.690
 finish the round because it was very dangerous 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.880
 Many of you have already seen the journey of 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.100
 trànsit that I went up that we took study of 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.410
 little bit of dying but but that was the 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.500
 round 50 not the 64 that there is a great 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.300
 difference so it was good over there 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.830
 the round little by little it's worth it did not touch me 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.870
 I think that neither a snapshot nor anything 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.210
 I have to pump a carpenter one 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.310
 port and I do not know without vacuum ammunition the 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.620
 ammunition and had touched and nothing what 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.560
 you have to do is it's simple to be 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:45.710
 here you also have to go with 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.080
 very careful here there are so there that 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.810
 do it slowly the truth because the 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.270
 weapon pulls you forward and also in 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.330
 the zombies and that's a bitch then 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.970
 here little by little carefully if also 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.430
 I tell them if it is before round 60 what 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.810
 what you have to do is that with the laser 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.420
 leave half lame it's worth that already 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.250
 I explained in the weapon tutorial but 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.750
 well I'll say it again 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.400
 if it is before they reached 60 plus or minus 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.370
 you leave the lame and the others in the middle 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.110
 being able to kill quite fast in the 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.570
 round of 68 I do not recommend it because 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.310
 country leave the entire link and like a 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.590
 once managed to leave them in the middle lame 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.850
 you get an instant low and it has 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.730
 avail happened to me in 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:29.850
 several prayers so it's worth going 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.070
 so be careful with you wait a lot 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:33.930
 so they hit a shadow of water 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.100
 so what happened to me sometimes 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.350
 that he has heated a lot but it is 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.620
 because he was already tired and they hit 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:43.890
 blow and kill at least 8 989 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.320
 zombies and once you get to the round 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.880
 69 if you want to reach 70 or the round 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.440
 What do you want to get, what do you have? 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.120
 what to do is go to the bank to check that 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.180
 you have it full for when it will return to 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.620
 play cooperatively or because really 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.780
 you have nothing to do with the money 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.570
 you keep it in the bank that sure 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:04.020
 that you spend it later and nothing to look for 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.340
 a point where suicide funny or what 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.170
 that you fancy or the truth is that I 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.350
 there I did not feel like there are many people who 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:12.870
 commits suicide 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:15.600
 who commits suicide where he is in the light 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.460
 is thrown to the lava and all that I do not 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.810
 I wanted to go to light although I still have 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:23.430
 two thousand would have been a moment to arrive 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:26.459
 but nothing jumps from here and so 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:29.310
 I broke the jerc am by air and I 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:32.280
 they supported so nothing good this has been 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.170
 the pretty big traffic guide 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:38.549
 between the last part and between the part 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:40.170
 previous and this one but the reason was that 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:42.329
 they killed in the fifty-odd round by 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.980
 bus fault the face piece of that 

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:45.689
 he left the zombie divers and he did not 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.920
 have seen that video I recommend that 

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:51.359
 I see it because they give me for ass but well 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.400
 so nothing and there I was checking already 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:55.560
 the markers but you know that 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.609
 transite are bursting and ximo is worth 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.680
 the clicks that good is what there is not like that 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:03.239
 that nothing with a legal 70 I already 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.040
 I agree if I had been the other way 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.650
 to use it yesterday earn the same 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.919
 tica a little bit more or he had a 100 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:13.109
 if it is that if you were motivated but 

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:15.090
 with this form I am not attracted too 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:17.729
 to the zombies and it's a bit dangerous 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.320
 so nothing and I tell you I can not 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:21.299
 get me worry about or between 100 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.270
 first while the first ones 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:25.879
 page nothing because 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.430
 there are many people who will surely 

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:30.770
 people who will have made it legal but little 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.930
 very little so nothing good I hope that 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.530
 I liked it and nothing and you tell me a 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.530
 greeting people
