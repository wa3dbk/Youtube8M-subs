have<00:00:22.740> seen<00:00:22.859> that<00:00:22.980> too<00:00:23.490> often<00:00:23.670> some<00:00:24.359> of<00:00:24.510> us

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
have seen that too often some of us

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.630 
have seen that too often some of us
might<00:00:24.840> think<00:00:25.109> that<00:00:25.170> it's<00:00:25.380> not<00:00:26.220> controlled

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
might think that it's not controlled

might think that it's not controlled
enough<00:00:26.849> but<00:00:27.060> what<00:00:27.210> we<00:00:27.300> try<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.510> be<00:00:27.660> is

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
enough but what we try and be is

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.050 
enough but what we try and be is
produced<00:00:28.920> as<00:00:29.039> much<00:00:29.160> force<00:00:29.400> as<00:00:29.519> possible<00:00:29.970> as

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
produced as much force as possible as

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.609 
produced as much force as possible as
quickly<00:00:30.240> as<00:00:30.510> possible<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.199> Machine<00:00:31.529> oh

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
quickly as possible and the Machine oh

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:32.780 
quickly as possible and the Machine oh
yeah<00:00:31.800> we'll<00:00:32.009> measure<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.369> amount<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.579> force

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
yeah we'll measure the amount of force
