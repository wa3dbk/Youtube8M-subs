hey YouTube 30 friend life and today is

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.120 
hey YouTube 30 friend life and today is
going<00:00:03.810> to<00:00:04.020> be<00:00:04.170> a<00:00:04.350> tutorial<00:00:04.650> on<00:00:04.980> how<00:00:05.100> to

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
going to be a tutorial on how to

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.570 
going to be a tutorial on how to
auto-tune<00:00:05.819> your<00:00:06.060> 3d<00:00:06.540> printers<00:00:06.930> thermistor

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:07.580 
auto-tune your 3d printers thermistor

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.129 
auto-tune your 3d printers thermistor
this<00:00:08.580> is<00:00:08.730> something<00:00:09.120> that<00:00:09.269> you<00:00:09.450> have<00:00:09.690> to<00:00:10.019> do

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
this is something that you have to do

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.709 
this is something that you have to do
with<00:00:10.380> a<00:00:10.559> new<00:00:11.340> hot<00:00:11.580> underneath<00:00:11.880> thermistor<00:00:12.509> and

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
with a new hot underneath thermistor and

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.279 
with a new hot underneath thermistor and
is<00:00:13.530> definitely<00:00:14.250> a<00:00:15.619> advised<00:00:16.619> process<00:00:17.190> to<00:00:17.400> take

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:18.289 
is definitely a advised process to take

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:21.140 
is definitely a advised process to take
after<00:00:19.289> you<00:00:19.529> break<00:00:19.740> in<00:00:19.949> your<00:00:20.130> new<00:00:20.460> hot<00:00:20.939> end

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
after you break in your new hot end

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.880 
after you break in your new hot end
after<00:00:21.330> about<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:21.810> month<00:00:22.199> because<00:00:22.740> you'll

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
after about a month because you'll

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.460 
after about a month because you'll
probably<00:00:23.070> get<00:00:23.310> some<00:00:23.369> different<00:00:23.699> settings<00:00:24.470> so

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
probably get some different settings so

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.779 
probably get some different settings so
first<00:00:25.769> thing<00:00:25.890> you're<00:00:25.980> not<00:00:26.039> do<00:00:26.340> is<00:00:26.460> open<00:00:26.730> up

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
first thing you're not do is open up

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.700 
first thing you're not do is open up
repetier-host<00:00:27.269> or<00:00:27.660> whatever<00:00:27.900> communications

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
repetier-host or whatever communications

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.890 
repetier-host or whatever communications
software<00:00:29.400> you<00:00:29.699> use<00:00:29.730> turn<00:00:30.570> on<00:00:30.660> your<00:00:30.750> printer

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
software you use turn on your printer

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.720 
software you use turn on your printer
and<00:00:31.230> connect<00:00:31.529> with<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:31.859> now<00:00:32.340> this<00:00:32.460> process

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
and connect with it now this process

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.250 
and connect with it now this process
will<00:00:33.120> heat<00:00:33.300> up<00:00:33.329> your<00:00:33.540> hot<00:00:33.690> end<00:00:33.870> so<00:00:34.079> make<00:00:34.110> sure

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
will heat up your hot end so make sure

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.770 
will heat up your hot end so make sure
that<00:00:34.559> it<00:00:34.649> is<00:00:34.800> um<00:00:35.239> clear<00:00:36.239> from<00:00:36.420> anything<00:00:36.600> that

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
that it is um clear from anything that

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.619 
that it is um clear from anything that
could<00:00:36.960> be<00:00:37.200> damaged<00:00:37.500> by<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.649> heat<00:00:38.360> now<00:00:39.360> go<00:00:39.540> into

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
could be damaged by the heat now go into

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.030 
could be damaged by the heat now go into
your<00:00:39.690> gene<00:00:39.930> code<00:00:40.140> commands<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:40.829> you're<00:00:40.920> going

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
your gene code commands and you're going

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.660 
your gene code commands and you're going
to<00:00:41.100> type<00:00:41.280> em<00:00:41.540> 303<00:00:42.540> hit<00:00:43.230> enter<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.710> on<00:00:44.579> the

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
to type em 303 hit enter and on the

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.340 
to type em 303 hit enter and on the
bottom<00:00:44.940> it's<00:00:45.059> going<00:00:45.149> to<00:00:45.270> say<00:00:45.420> PID<00:00:45.809> auto-tune

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
bottom it's going to say PID auto-tune

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.610 
bottom it's going to say PID auto-tune
start<00:00:46.680> wherever<00:00:46.950> your<00:00:47.480> logs<00:00:48.480> are<00:00:48.780> so<00:00:49.469> as<00:00:49.530> you

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
start wherever your logs are so as you

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.170 
start wherever your logs are so as you
can<00:00:49.710> see<00:00:49.829> there<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.460> you're<00:00:51.030> going<00:00:51.120> to

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
can see there it is and you're going to

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.880 
can see there it is and you're going to
notice<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.629> temperature<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.289> thermistor<00:00:52.559> is

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
notice the temperature the thermistor is

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.189 
notice the temperature the thermistor is
going<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.340> start<00:00:53.610> heating<00:00:53.879> up<00:00:54.090> it's<00:00:55.020> going<00:00:55.140> to

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
going to start heating up it's going to

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.700 
going to start heating up it's going to
get<00:00:55.320> up<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.649> about<00:00:56.390> 150<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.629> believe<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.500> don't

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
get up to about 150 I believe so don't

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.849 
get up to about 150 I believe so don't
worry<00:00:58.859> if<00:00:59.579> for<00:01:00.239> some<00:01:00.270> reason<00:01:00.840> it<00:01:00.989> goes<00:01:01.199> above

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
worry if for some reason it goes above

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.929 
worry if for some reason it goes above
200<00:01:02.789> or<00:01:03.000> up<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.750> 20<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.890> would<00:01:05.250> cut<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.460> off<00:01:05.640> but

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
200 or up to 20 I would cut it off but

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.660 
200 or up to 20 I would cut it off but
it<00:01:06.060> shouldn't<00:01:06.479> go<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.780> high<00:01:07.049> I<00:01:07.549> don't<00:01:08.549> really

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
it shouldn't go that high I don't really

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.050 
it shouldn't go that high I don't really
think<00:01:08.850> there's<00:01:09.060> any<00:01:09.240> reason<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.659> should<00:01:11.060> but

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
think there's any reason it should but

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.030 
think there's any reason it should but
yeah<00:01:12.299> so<00:01:12.479> just<00:01:12.600> let<00:01:12.810> that<00:01:12.960> run<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.470> then<00:01:13.920> we

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
yeah so just let that run and then we

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.679 
yeah so just let that run and then we
when<00:01:14.400> you<00:01:14.430> are<00:01:14.640> done<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:15.000> will<00:01:15.119> be<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.299> love

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
when you are done you will be I love

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.120 
when you are done you will be I love
some<00:01:16.020> value<00:01:16.350> so<00:01:16.500> I'm<00:01:16.590> just<00:01:16.680> going<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.920> cut<00:01:17.100> to

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
some value so I'm just going to cut to

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.810 
some value so I'm just going to cut to
that<00:01:19.549> okay<00:01:20.549> so<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:21.119> process<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:21.900> done<00:01:22.229> here

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
that okay so the process is done here

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.760 
that okay so the process is done here
yes<00:01:23.820> okay<00:01:24.299> it's<00:01:24.479> recording<00:01:24.540> um<00:01:25.409> so<00:01:25.650> you're

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
yes okay it's recording um so you're

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.800 
yes okay it's recording um so you're
going<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:25.950> get<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.280> few<00:01:27.150> of<00:01:27.240> these<00:01:27.330> messages

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
going to get a few of these messages

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.140 
going to get a few of these messages
saying<00:01:28.110> bias<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.250> then<00:01:29.430> giving<00:01:29.729> you<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.880> range

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
saying bias and then giving you a range

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.210 
saying bias and then giving you a range
temperatures<00:01:30.689> as<00:01:31.020> basically<00:01:31.560> it's<00:01:31.710> testing

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
temperatures as basically it's testing

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.230 
temperatures as basically it's testing
results<00:01:33.049> and<00:01:34.049> then<00:01:34.560> at<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.770> very<00:01:34.799> bottom

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
results and then at the very bottom

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.240 
results and then at the very bottom
you're<00:01:36.240> going<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.479> get<00:01:36.689> an<00:01:36.900> output<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.829> sorry

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
you're going to get an output of sorry

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.090 
you're going to get an output of sorry
area<00:01:38.880> it's<00:01:39.210> going<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.479> say<00:01:39.659> classic<00:01:40.380> PID<00:01:40.770> and

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
area it's going to say classic PID and

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.100 
area it's going to say classic PID and

great<00:02:11.400> thing<00:02:11.550> to<00:02:11.640> mention<00:02:11.760> is<00:02:12.060> if<00:02:12.240> you<00:02:12.360> are

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
great thing to mention is if you are

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.260 
great thing to mention is if you are
using<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.870> new<00:02:13.020> thermistor<00:02:13.710> you<00:02:14.610> might<00:02:14.940> have<00:02:15.120> to

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
using a new thermistor you might have to

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.560 
using a new thermistor you might have to
change<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:15.600> temp<00:02:15.990> sensor<00:02:16.490> so<00:02:17.490> for<00:02:17.850> the<00:02:18.000> e3d<00:02:18.450> v6

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
change the temp sensor so for the e3d v6

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.430 
change the temp sensor so for the e3d v6
you<00:02:19.440> have<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:19.650> change<00:02:19.860> this<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.250> five<00:02:21.440> default

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
you have to change this to five default

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.930 
you have to change this to five default
it<00:02:22.650> might<00:02:22.830> be<00:02:22.950> something<00:02:23.130> else<00:02:23.430> depending<00:02:23.820> on

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
it might be something else depending on

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.360 
it might be something else depending on
your<00:02:24.000> printer<00:02:24.360> your<00:02:24.600> hot<00:02:24.780> end<00:02:25.010> but<00:02:26.010> anyway<00:02:26.310> so

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
your printer your hot end but anyway so

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.750 
your printer your hot end but anyway so
make<00:02:26.850> sure<00:02:26.880> that's<00:02:27.120> right<00:02:28.400> you<00:02:29.400> also<00:02:29.520> want<00:02:29.730> to

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
make sure that's right you also want to

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.949 
make sure that's right you also want to
make<00:02:29.880> sure<00:02:29.910> this<00:02:30.150> is<00:02:30.300> right<00:02:30.450> before<00:02:30.600> you<00:02:30.840> do

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
make sure this is right before you do

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.460 
make sure this is right before you do
the<00:02:31.140> auto-tune<00:02:31.470> I<00:02:31.770> should<00:02:31.980> mention<00:02:32.160> and<00:02:33.470> then

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
the auto-tune I should mention and then

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.210 
the auto-tune I should mention and then
you're<00:02:34.590> going<00:02:34.709> to<00:02:34.770> scroll<00:02:34.950> down<00:02:35.010> a<00:02:35.130> bit

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
you're going to scroll down a bit

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.340 
you're going to scroll down a bit

default KP ki and KD and what you're

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.020 
default KP ki and KD and what you're
just<00:02:40.560> going<00:02:40.709> to<00:02:40.800> want<00:02:40.950> to<00:02:40.980> do<00:02:41.130> is<00:02:41.340> copy<00:02:41.790> and

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
just going to want to do is copy and

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.910 
just going to want to do is copy and
paste<00:02:42.239> those<00:02:42.450> values<00:02:42.900> in<00:02:43.110> you<00:02:43.500> can<00:02:43.650> actually

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
paste those values in you can actually

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.770 
paste those values in you can actually
copy<00:02:44.070> it<00:02:44.310> but<00:02:44.459> you<00:02:44.550> can<00:02:44.670> just<00:02:44.820> type<00:02:45.030> it<00:02:45.180> in<00:02:45.300> so

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
copy it but you can just type it in so

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:46.970 
copy it but you can just type it in so
as<00:02:45.930> you<00:02:46.080> can<00:02:46.140> see<00:02:46.200> my<00:02:46.470> values<00:02:46.800> are<00:02:46.890> actually

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
as you can see my values are actually

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.440 
as you can see my values are actually
different<00:02:47.520> than<00:02:47.610> what<00:02:47.790> I<00:02:47.820> have<00:02:48.030> here<00:02:48.300> and

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
different than what I have here and

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.390 
different than what I have here and
that's<00:02:48.510> because<00:02:48.959> I<00:02:49.200> did<00:02:50.480> the<00:02:51.480> initial

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
that's because I did the initial

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.650 
that's because I did the initial
auto-tune<00:02:53.400> quit<00:02:53.880> some<00:02:54.060> time<00:02:54.209> ago<00:02:54.450> and<00:02:54.510> it's

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
auto-tune quit some time ago and it's

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.300 
auto-tune quit some time ago and it's
been<00:02:54.750> broken<00:02:55.350> in<00:02:55.560> so<00:02:55.830> the<00:02:56.010> values<00:02:56.280> are

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
been broken in so the values are

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.650 
been broken in so the values are
actually<00:02:56.489> quite<00:02:56.910> significantly<00:02:57.450> difficult

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
actually quite significantly difficult

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.090 
actually quite significantly difficult
so<00:02:58.440> what<00:02:58.560> I'm<00:02:58.620> going<00:02:58.709> to<00:02:58.769> do<00:02:58.860> is<00:02:58.950> I'm<00:02:59.070> just

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
so what I'm going to do is I'm just

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.060 
so what I'm going to do is I'm just
gonna<00:02:59.280> throw<00:02:59.459> these<00:02:59.670> in<00:02:59.970> and<00:03:00.709> also<00:03:01.709> make<00:03:01.950> sure

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
gonna throw these in and also make sure

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:04.370 
gonna throw these in and also make sure
these<00:03:02.190> are<00:03:02.370> uncommented<00:03:03.150> you<00:03:04.080> might<00:03:04.230> have

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
these are uncommented you might have

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.750 
these are uncommented you might have
some<00:03:04.500> extra<00:03:04.530> ones<00:03:04.950> that<00:03:05.160> are<00:03:05.250> commented<00:03:05.670> out

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
some extra ones that are commented out

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.610 
some extra ones that are commented out
with<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.120> two<00:03:06.540> slashes<00:03:06.840> like<00:03:07.170> these<00:03:07.350> so<00:03:07.560> you

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
with the two slashes like these so you

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.380 
with the two slashes like these so you
can<00:03:07.739> just<00:03:07.860> leave<00:03:08.040> them<00:03:08.250> and<00:03:08.459> edit<00:03:09.060> the<00:03:09.269> one

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
can just leave them and edit the one

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:10.880 
can just leave them and edit the one
that<00:03:09.540> is<00:03:09.630> uncommented<00:03:10.380> that<00:03:10.530> is<00:03:10.650> eight

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
that is uncommented that is eight

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.720 
that is uncommented that is eight

eight I don't really know why I'm

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.990

changing<00:03:17.580> these<00:03:17.730> because<00:03:19.250> I'm<00:03:20.250> not<00:03:20.459> uploading

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
changing these because I'm not uploading

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.840 
changing these because I'm not uploading
it<00:03:21.120> but<00:03:21.480> whatever<00:03:22.019> so<00:03:22.769> he<00:03:22.980> changed<00:03:23.370> those<00:03:23.549> and

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
it but whatever so he changed those and

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.650 
it but whatever so he changed those and
then<00:03:24.390> you<00:03:24.540> can<00:03:25.280> save<00:03:26.280> the<00:03:26.400> firmware<00:03:26.610> and<00:03:27.480> then

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
then you can save the firmware and then

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.430 
then you can save the firmware and then
you<00:03:27.750> can<00:03:27.930> upload<00:03:28.260> it<00:03:29.390> using<00:03:30.390> live<00:03:31.230> another

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
you can upload it using live another

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.620 
you can upload it using live another
tutorial<00:03:31.799> on<00:03:32.070> that<00:03:32.310> if<00:03:32.610> you'd<00:03:32.820> like<00:03:32.880> but

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
tutorial on that if you'd like but

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.000 
tutorial on that if you'd like but
that's<00:03:33.810> pretty<00:03:34.019> much<00:03:34.170> it<00:03:34.350> that's<00:03:34.380> all<00:03:34.860> there

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
that's pretty much it that's all there

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.440 
that's pretty much it that's all there
is<00:03:35.040> to<00:03:35.250> it<00:03:35.310> it's<00:03:35.459> really<00:03:35.489> not<00:03:35.760> that<00:03:35.820> hard<00:03:36.150> it's

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
is to it it's really not that hard it's

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.960 
is to it it's really not that hard it's
just<00:03:36.900> writing<00:03:37.500> that<00:03:37.680> one<00:03:37.860> command<00:03:38.220> and<00:03:38.400> then
