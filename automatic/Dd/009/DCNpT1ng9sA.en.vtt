00:05:13.149 --> 00:05:14.459 
code and simulation when you click on
this<00:05:13.300> you'll<00:05:13.539> see<00:05:13.599> that<00:05:13.749> it<00:05:13.959> begins<00:05:14.110> running

00:05:14.459 --> 00:05:14.469 
this you'll see that it begins running

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:16.499 
this you'll see that it begins running
down<00:05:14.770> here<00:05:15.069> and<00:05:15.249> so<00:05:15.699> it<00:05:15.849> starts<00:05:16.089> running<00:05:16.240> raw

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:16.509 
down here and so it starts running raw

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:18.480 
down here and so it starts running raw
score<00:05:16.869> and<00:05:17.110> soon<00:05:17.649> it<00:05:17.830> will<00:05:17.889> bring<00:05:18.099> up<00:05:18.279> your

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
score and soon it will bring up your

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.009 
score and soon it will bring up your
driver<00:05:18.819> state<00:05:19.119> your<00:05:19.209> fake<00:05:19.360> driver<00:05:19.599> station

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:20.019 
driver state your fake driver station

00:05:20.019 --> 00:05:23.429 
driver state your fake driver station
and<00:05:20.229> gazebo<00:05:20.800> itself<00:05:21.809> you'll<00:05:22.809> see<00:05:23.019> here<00:05:23.229> on<00:05:23.349> the

00:05:23.429 --> 00:05:23.439 
and gazebo itself you'll see here on the

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:24.749 
and gazebo itself you'll see here on the
driver<00:05:23.649> station<00:05:24.069> that<00:05:24.219> I<00:05:24.249> already<00:05:24.459> have<00:05:24.729> a

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:24.759 
driver station that I already have a

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:27.269 
driver station that I already have a
Logitech<00:05:25.300> controller<00:05:25.689> plugged<00:05:26.050> in<00:05:26.199> and<00:05:26.439> it's

00:05:27.269 --> 00:05:27.279 
Logitech controller plugged in and it's

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:31.049 
Logitech controller plugged in and it's
ready<00:05:27.459> to<00:05:27.580> do<00:05:27.699> our<00:05:27.939> tally<00:05:28.899> up<00:05:29.080> code<00:05:29.580> so<00:05:30.580> here<00:05:30.909> is

00:05:31.049 --> 00:05:31.059 
ready to do our tally up code so here is

00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:33.719 
ready to do our tally up code so here is
gazebo<00:05:31.569> you<00:05:32.050> can<00:05:32.199> see<00:05:32.379> this<00:05:32.740> is<00:05:32.949> the<00:05:33.099> packet

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:33.729 
gazebo you can see this is the packet

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:35.519 
gazebo you can see this is the packet
that<00:05:33.939> we<00:05:34.119> were<00:05:34.269> looking<00:05:34.659> at<00:05:34.749> the<00:05:34.869> RTF<00:05:35.289> file

00:05:35.519 --> 00:05:35.529 
that we were looking at the RTF file

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:37.259 
that we were looking at the RTF file
earlier<00:05:35.979> you'll<00:05:36.490> see<00:05:36.639> it<00:05:36.759> starts<00:05:37.059> a<00:05:37.149> little

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:37.269 
earlier you'll see it starts a little

00:05:37.269 --> 00:05:38.850 
earlier you'll see it starts a little
bit<00:05:37.479> off<00:05:37.599> the<00:05:37.629> ground<00:05:37.930> so<00:05:38.139> that<00:05:38.169> parameter<00:05:38.740> may

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:38.860 
bit off the ground so that parameter may

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.189 
bit off the ground so that parameter may
need<00:05:39.009> to<00:05:39.099> be<00:05:39.189> tuned<00:05:39.399> a<00:05:39.490> little<00:05:39.519> bit<00:05:39.759> more<00:05:40.199> but

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:41.199 
need to be tuned a little bit more but

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:42.359 
need to be tuned a little bit more but
we're<00:05:41.319> ready<00:05:41.469> to<00:05:41.649> try<00:05:41.830> and<00:05:41.889> drive<00:05:42.069> this<00:05:42.219> guy

00:05:42.359 --> 00:05:42.369 
we're ready to try and drive this guy

00:05:42.369 --> 00:05:44.339 
we're ready to try and drive this guy
around<00:05:42.519> so<00:05:43.269> if<00:05:43.360> you<00:05:43.449> go<00:05:43.629> in<00:05:43.779> here<00:05:43.809> and<00:05:44.110> you<00:05:44.199> hit

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:44.349 
around so if you go in here and you hit

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:46.049 
around so if you go in here and you hit
play<00:05:44.589> that'll<00:05:45.459> start<00:05:45.639> the<00:05:45.759> physics

00:05:46.049 --> 00:05:46.059 
play that'll start the physics

00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:47.790 
play that'll start the physics
simulation<00:05:46.569> so<00:05:46.930> you<00:05:47.019> can<00:05:47.139> see<00:05:47.349> that<00:05:47.529> all<00:05:47.649> the

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
simulation so you can see that all the

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.829 
simulation so you can see that all the
links<00:05:48.039> are<00:05:48.159> ready<00:05:48.309> to<00:05:48.399> move<00:05:48.550> around<00:05:48.839> you'll

00:05:49.829 --> 00:05:49.839 
links are ready to move around you'll

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:52.290 
links are ready to move around you'll
then<00:05:49.990> come<00:05:50.169> up<00:05:50.199> here<00:05:50.289> to<00:05:50.499> enable<00:05:50.860> and<00:05:51.300> then

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.300 
then come up here to enable and then

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.059 
then come up here to enable and then
there<00:05:53.079> you<00:05:53.169> go<00:05:53.289> now<00:05:53.499> you<00:05:53.559> can<00:05:53.649> see<00:05:53.860> that<00:05:53.979> I'm

00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:54.069 
there you go now you can see that I'm

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:57.839 
there you go now you can see that I'm
driving<00:05:54.459> the<00:05:54.519> robot<00:05:54.669> around<00:05:56.699> using<00:05:57.699> the

00:05:57.839 --> 00:05:57.849 
driving the robot around using the

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:02.279 
driving the robot around using the
controller<00:05:58.300> joystick<00:05:58.779> that<00:05:58.959> I<00:05:58.990> have<00:05:59.229> here<00:06:01.289> now

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:02.289 
controller joystick that I have here now

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:05.549 
controller joystick that I have here now
if<00:06:03.189> you<00:06:03.369> try<00:06:03.550> and<00:06:03.759> run<00:06:04.059> and<00:06:04.389> your<00:06:05.199> robot

00:06:05.549 --> 00:06:05.559 
if you try and run and your robot

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:07.109 
if you try and run and your robot
doesn't<00:06:05.740> seem<00:06:05.979> to<00:06:06.099> run<00:06:06.219> around<00:06:06.519> there's<00:06:06.999> a

00:06:07.109 --> 00:06:07.119 
doesn't seem to run around there's a

00:06:07.119 --> 00:06:08.279 
doesn't seem to run around there's a
chance<00:06:07.360> that<00:06:07.539> you<00:06:07.629> aren't<00:06:07.809> giving<00:06:08.110> it<00:06:08.199> the

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:08.289 
chance that you aren't giving it the

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:10.379 
chance that you aren't giving it the
right<00:06:08.439> values<00:06:08.860> to<00:06:09.039> your<00:06:09.159> motors<00:06:09.459> you<00:06:10.089> may<00:06:10.240> need

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:10.389 
right values to your motors you may need

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:12.659 
right values to your motors you may need
to<00:06:10.479> go<00:06:10.629> and<00:06:10.930> edit<00:06:11.139> the<00:06:11.439> robot<00:06:11.769> map<00:06:11.979> so<00:06:12.490> that

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:12.669 
to go and edit the robot map so that

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:14.069 
to go and edit the robot map so that
your<00:06:12.759> multiplier<00:06:13.269> is<00:06:13.419> something<00:06:13.749> other<00:06:13.930> than

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:14.079 
your multiplier is something other than

00:06:14.079 --> 00:06:17.219 
your multiplier is something other than
run<00:06:14.319> one<00:06:14.949> this<00:06:15.759> robot<00:06:16.149> is<00:06:16.329> using<00:06:16.689> ten<00:06:16.959> as<00:06:17.199> a

run one this robot is using ten as a

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:19.709 
run one this robot is using ten as a
multiplier<00:06:17.999> but<00:06:18.999> yours<00:06:19.240> may<00:06:19.419> need<00:06:19.569> to<00:06:19.659> be

00:06:19.709 --> 00:06:19.719 
multiplier but yours may need to be

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:22.339 
multiplier but yours may need to be
higher<00:06:19.930> or<00:06:20.169> lower<00:06:20.349> depending<00:06:20.589> on<00:06:20.889> your<00:06:21.039> system

00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:22.349 
higher or lower depending on your system

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:24.540 
higher or lower depending on your system
that's<00:06:23.349> a<00:06:23.469> basic<00:06:23.740> overview<00:06:24.009> of<00:06:24.159> how<00:06:24.279> to<00:06:24.369> get

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:24.550 
that's a basic overview of how to get

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:25.949 
that's a basic overview of how to get
your<00:06:24.699> code<00:06:24.909> running<00:06:25.180> here<00:06:25.449> in<00:06:25.539> gazebo

your code running here in gazebo

00:06:25.959 --> 00:06:28.049 
your code running here in gazebo
hopefully<00:06:26.889> you<00:06:26.979> can<00:06:27.099> use<00:06:27.279> this<00:06:27.490> to<00:06:27.699> test<00:06:27.879> your

00:06:28.049 --> 00:06:28.059 
hopefully you can use this to test your

00:06:28.059 --> 00:06:29.699 
hopefully you can use this to test your
code<00:06:28.180> before<00:06:28.599> even<00:06:28.899> before<00:06:29.259> the<00:06:29.349> robot<00:06:29.499> is
