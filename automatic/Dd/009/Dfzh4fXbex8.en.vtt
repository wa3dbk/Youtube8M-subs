differences with them real quick and so
they're<00:01:27.420> this<00:01:28.250> size<00:01:29.250> and<00:01:29.909> weight<00:01:30.479> they<00:01:30.840> fill

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
they're this size and weight they fill

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.020 
they're this size and weight they fill
they're<00:01:31.619> pretty<00:01:31.979> much<00:01:32.100> identical<00:01:32.280> and

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
they're pretty much identical and

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.319 
they're pretty much identical and
there's<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.530> few<00:01:34.530> small<00:01:35.430> differences<00:01:35.729> with

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
there's a few small differences with

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.890 
there's a few small differences with
just<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.720> appearance<00:01:37.049> on<00:01:38.329> you<00:01:39.329> can<00:01:39.509> probably

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
just the appearance on you can probably

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.950 
just the appearance on you can probably
see<00:01:40.259> there<00:01:40.439> some<00:01:40.650> machine<00:01:41.070> marks<00:01:41.460> on<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:42.479> fake

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
see there some machine marks on the fake

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.399 
see there some machine marks on the fake
one<00:01:43.200> not<00:01:43.530> on<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.799> real<00:01:43.950> one

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
one not on the real one

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.170 
one not on the real one
then<00:01:46.409> this<00:01:46.560> is<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:46.740> bit<00:01:47.130> shinier<00:01:47.640> on<00:01:47.850> this<00:01:48.000> one

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
then this is a bit shinier on this one

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.490 
then this is a bit shinier on this one
that<00:01:48.299> does<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.630> Phoenix<00:01:51.079> cutouts<00:01:52.079> on<00:01:52.320> the

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
that does the Phoenix cutouts on the

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.760 
that does the Phoenix cutouts on the
underside<00:01:53.250> here<00:01:53.399> they<00:01:53.520> both<00:01:53.670> have<00:01:53.909> them<00:01:54.149> a

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
underside here they both have them a

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.899 
underside here they both have them a
little<00:01:55.770> bit<00:01:55.860> more<00:01:55.890> grippy<00:01:56.340> on<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.520> Phoenix

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
little bit more grippy on the Phoenix

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.749 
little bit more grippy on the Phoenix
and<00:01:57.090> this<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.360> other<00:01:57.600> one

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:04.020 

slot<00:02:02.479> here<00:02:02.810> is<00:02:02.960> a<00:02:02.990> little<00:02:03.200> bit<00:02:03.439> narrower

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
slot here is a little bit narrower

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.160 
slot here is a little bit narrower
Phoenix<00:02:05.030> pretty<00:02:05.659> much<00:02:05.780> the<00:02:05.930> biggest

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
Phoenix pretty much the biggest

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.229 
Phoenix pretty much the biggest
difference<00:02:06.590> these<00:02:06.710> two<00:02:06.920> have<00:02:07.130> this<00:02:07.880> is<00:02:08.060> the

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
difference these two have this is the

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:11.290 
difference these two have this is the
Phoenix<00:02:08.569> everyone<00:02:09.550> see<00:02:10.550> the<00:02:10.640> activation

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
Phoenix everyone see the activation

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.150 
Phoenix everyone see the activation
switch<00:02:11.599> the<00:02:12.050> power<00:02:12.230> switch<00:02:12.470> sticks<00:02:12.950> up<00:02:13.099> a

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
switch the power switch sticks up a

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.210 
switch the power switch sticks up a
little<00:02:13.310> bit<00:02:13.519> more<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:15.410> mode<00:02:15.739> selector

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:16.220 
little bit more the mode selector

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.580 
little bit more the mode selector
switches<00:02:16.519> which<00:02:16.910> are<00:02:17.090> these<00:02:17.319> smaller<00:02:18.319> runs

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
switches which are these smaller runs

here's the battery packs now the real

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.370 
here's the battery packs now the real
Phoenix<00:03:46.550> really<00:03:46.790> the<00:03:46.940> only<00:03:47.270> difference<00:03:47.810> on

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
Phoenix really the only difference on

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.280 
Phoenix really the only difference on
besides<00:03:48.800> there's<00:03:48.980> some<00:03:49.130> little<00:03:49.990> little<00:03:50.990> holes

besides there's some little little holes
are<00:03:51.500> a<00:03:51.530> difference<00:03:51.830> bus<00:03:52.040> but<00:03:52.220> pretty<00:03:52.490> much<00:03:52.550> the

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
are a difference bus but pretty much the

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.350 
are a difference bus but pretty much the
only<00:03:52.910> difference<00:03:53.480> is<00:03:53.770> the<00:03:54.770> Phoenix<00:03:55.640> has<00:03:55.940> this

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
only difference is the Phoenix has this

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.840 
only difference is the Phoenix has this
raised<00:03:56.810> and<00:03:57.230> has<00:03:57.470> a<00:03:57.500> raised<00:03:57.740> ring<00:03:58.040> so<00:03:58.310> this<00:03:58.640> one

do<00:05:37.649> a<00:05:37.710> little<00:05:38.339> comparison<00:05:39.139> with<00:05:40.139> the

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:40.259 
do a little comparison with the

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:41.899 
do a little comparison with the
brightnesses<00:05:40.740> I'll<00:05:41.369> get<00:05:41.550> some<00:05:41.729> outside

00:05:41.899 --> 00:05:41.909 
brightnesses I'll get some outside

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:44.209 
brightnesses I'll get some outside
videos<00:05:42.509> just<00:05:43.469> comparing<00:05:43.979> the<00:05:44.099> actual

00:05:44.209 --> 00:05:44.219 
videos just comparing the actual

videos just comparing the actual
brightness<00:05:44.550> between<00:05:45.240> the<00:05:45.360> truck<00:05:45.599> sides<00:05:48.229> give

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:49.229 
brightness between the truck sides give

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:50.869 
brightness between the truck sides give
me<00:05:49.319> a<00:05:49.349> day<00:05:49.620> or<00:05:49.649> two<00:05:49.979> to<00:05:50.009> do<00:05:50.309> that<00:05:50.580> I<00:05:50.819> don't

00:05:50.869 --> 00:05:50.879 
me a day or two to do that I don't

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:52.909 
me a day or two to do that I don't
suppose<00:05:51.479> there's<00:05:51.749> a<00:05:51.839> video<00:05:52.080> response<00:05:52.289> once<00:05:52.770> I

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:52.919 
suppose there's a video response once I

00:05:52.919 --> 00:06:06.170 
suppose there's a video response once I
do<00:05:52.979> it<00:05:54.289> okay<00:05:56.089> that<00:05:57.089> goes<00:05:57.389> lights<00:06:04.610> now<00:06:05.610> the

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 
do it okay that goes lights now the

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.230 
do it okay that goes lights now the
light<00:06:06.449> I<00:06:06.870> don't<00:06:07.439> know<00:06:07.529> why<00:06:07.770> it's<00:06:08.610> flickering

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.240 
light I don't know why it's flickering

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.929 
light I don't know why it's flickering
like<00:06:09.449> that<00:06:09.689> it<00:06:10.169> is<00:06:10.349> not<00:06:10.740> done<00:06:11.039> in<00:06:11.069> real<00:06:11.550> life<00:06:11.759> at

00:06:11.929 --> 00:06:11.939 
like that it is not done in real life at

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:14.629 
like that it is not done in real life at
all<00:06:12.059> I<00:06:12.389> have<00:06:13.110> no<00:06:13.139> clue<00:06:13.889> lights<00:06:14.129> flickering

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:14.639 
all I have no clue lights flickering

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:16.779 
all I have no clue lights flickering
like<00:06:14.849> that<00:06:15.089> it's<00:06:15.300> nice<00:06:15.629> and<00:06:15.659> steady

00:06:16.779 --> 00:06:16.789 
like that it's nice and steady

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:19.100 
like that it's nice and steady
so<00:06:17.789> I'm<00:06:17.849> not<00:06:17.939> sure<00:06:18.209> what's<00:06:18.389> going<00:06:18.449> on<00:06:18.809> there

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.110 
so I'm not sure what's going on there

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:26.480 
so I'm not sure what's going on there
but<00:06:24.289> nothing<00:06:25.289> gets<00:06:25.529> up<00:06:25.680> on<00:06:25.830> high<00:06:26.009> it<00:06:26.219> stops

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.490 
but nothing gets up on high it stops

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.850 
but nothing gets up on high it stops
doing<00:06:26.729> it<00:06:26.999> I<00:06:27.209> don't<00:06:27.899> know<00:06:28.199> what's<00:06:28.469> going<00:06:28.740> on

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:28.860 
doing it I don't know what's going on

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.040 
doing it I don't know what's going on
with<00:06:28.949> my<00:06:29.069> camera<00:06:29.490> but<00:06:29.699> now<00:06:30.449> you<00:06:30.509> can<00:06:30.839> probably

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.050 
with my camera but now you can probably

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:32.809 
with my camera but now you can probably
tell<00:06:31.289> when<00:06:31.439> I<00:06:31.499> hold<00:06:31.680> up<00:06:31.769> a<00:06:32.069> table<00:06:32.430> like<00:06:32.519> this

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:32.819 
tell when I hold up a table like this

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:37.179 
tell when I hold up a table like this
here<00:06:33.240> the<00:06:33.479> Phoenix<00:06:34.490> which<00:06:35.490> is<00:06:35.669> the<00:06:35.849> one<00:06:36.089> on<00:06:36.330> the
