 sympathy and their good humor to engage 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:17.680
 a conversation 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:19.510
 and you go to moc me moreau moore a 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.830
 the two main elements of the 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.830
 move is the carton 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:54.610

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:56.020
 galley mastery tap me once 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.369
 the room was totally 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.390
 Guérés you have to admit something 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.760
 she has all the furniture 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.250
 merchant she had lost her the space of the 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.330
 it seemed a bit gigantic

 small now good actually the real 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.980
 reason is because it overlooks the 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.600
 balcony where we said Richard like our 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.310
