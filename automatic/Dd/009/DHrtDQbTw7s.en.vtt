00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
number is you will be able to roughly

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.760

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
specific to your needs and goals you can

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.889 
specific to your needs and goals you can
expect<00:02:05.739> to<00:02:05.920> lose<00:02:06.069> a<00:02:06.130> minimum<00:02:06.640> about<00:02:06.940> 1<00:02:07.390> to<00:02:07.690> 2

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
expect to lose a minimum about 1 to 2

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:09.830 
expect to lose a minimum about 1 to 2
pounds<00:02:08.170> of<00:02:08.410> body<00:02:08.560> fat<00:02:08.709> each<00:02:09.130> week<00:02:09.399> on<00:02:09.610> average

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
pounds of body fat each week on average

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.809 
pounds of body fat each week on average
so<00:02:10.840> the<00:02:10.989> closer<00:02:11.349> you<00:02:11.620> are<00:02:11.650> to<00:02:11.800> 12%<00:02:12.489> body<00:02:12.640> fat

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
so the closer you are to 12% body fat

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.030 
so the closer you are to 12% body fat
the<00:02:13.180> shorter<00:02:13.599> it<00:02:13.720> will<00:02:13.840> take<00:02:14.080> you<00:02:14.290> to<00:02:14.470> start
