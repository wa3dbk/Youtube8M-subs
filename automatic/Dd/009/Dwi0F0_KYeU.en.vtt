 you're going to find our plate deadlock on the field 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.599

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:21.199
 first battery 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:24.470
 and he is picking it up but not so much when you move on to me 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:29.970
 good news for you 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.760
 nicolas brushette meters 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.990
 to help you finally what does it serve the kidnappers 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.360
 we have associated 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.470
 for the rest 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.060
 the French song 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.060
 for agreement is sorted 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.670
 it starts to defend having the information 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.300
 decide if you are a stopping point 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.870
 it's in his interest 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.870
 but also the movies on each of winter 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.360
 we say that we feel 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.360
 these are public emilie 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.730
 two men they refused access from those there 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.270
 and it also allows 120 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.720
 by the way a few days 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:17.890
 he is coming out of losses 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.890
 the idea is that it allows to have an opinion 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:24.900
 some dead people 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.470
 we do not see any ferry 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.770
 a film thinks that it's a fact 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.870
 to have the heart net 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.870
 if that's what you want to call 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.300
 while people ask his mother 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.390
 the saq has grown from 16 00 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.390
 so at his favorite place send an email 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.870
 some questions 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.340
 if that's what you want erased 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.140
 you have to eat meals 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.210
 not stop there 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.150

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.390
 You are quite right 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.090
 thoune citadis consumes much at most 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.159
 and I do not know if anyone moved 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:13.149
 is enough 

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:16.179
 watch out i hope pretty 

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:18.869
 it's not about statistics 

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:21.869
 after a first and the only way to know whether or not 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:25.869
 to remain humble 

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:27.829
 Courroye 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:30.829
 you will see that their experience 

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:34.579
 the supports are barely 

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:37.579
