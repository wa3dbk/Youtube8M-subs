one-hour<00:03:28.069> I<00:03:28.189> would<00:03:28.400> have<00:03:28.519> to<00:03:28.609> fiddle<00:03:28.849> with<00:03:29.000> it

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
one-hour I would have to fiddle with it

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.569 
one-hour I would have to fiddle with it
to<00:03:29.840> get<00:03:29.930> it<00:03:30.079> to<00:03:30.109> charge<00:03:30.500> start<00:03:30.859> charging<00:03:31.370> and

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
it was like five minutes to get it to

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:35.890 
it was like five minutes to get it to
sit<00:03:33.920> in<00:03:34.010> the<00:03:34.069> cradle<00:03:34.280> properly<00:03:34.849> so<00:03:35.480> i<00:03:35.510> just
