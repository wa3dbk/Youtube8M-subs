00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.320
Within the pitch black darkness, that’s right, I’m your believer

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.060
Even if you forget me, I’ll always love you forever

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.700
Believing while in the darkness, that’s right, I’m your believer

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.420
I want to dance someday, forever I’m your doll

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.040
Even though I’m covered in dust, that’s right, I’m your believer

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.660
I’ll always love you forever, I’ll always be your doll

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.560
Believing while in the darkness, that’s right, I’m your believer

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.300
If I can dance someday then will my dreams come true?

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:34.420
Ah, sleeping within the darkness, the doll dreams as she waits

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:54.240
During a time when sorrow keeps on adding up, all alone, until the day she’s picked up

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:04.940
Even surrounded by the dark cloud of sadness, I dream of the day I can dance

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:14.560
Continuing to love and believe in you, waiting for the time when you come to pick me up

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:24.180
I’m not here for anyone else but you, forever and always love me!

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:34.280
Even in the lasting darkness of loneliness, waiting to someday be embraced

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.200
Even shaking in the darkness, that’s right, I’m your believer

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.880
Without forgetting me, always love me forever

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.800
Believing while in the darkness, that’s right, I’m your believer

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.440
Believing in you, forever I’m your doll!

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:17.620
Ah, being touched while I’m within this dream, even now, the warmth provides me a light

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:37.520
Sorrow gathers up within the midst of love, all alone, until the day I am picked up

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:48.140
Even surrounded by the dark cloud of sadness, I dream of the day I can dance

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:57.660
Continuing to love and believe in you, waiting for the time when you come to pick me up

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:07.260
I’m not here for anyone else but you, forever and always love me!

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:17.240
Even in the darkness of a continuing loneliness, I wait to someday be embraced

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:28.820
Finally I’ve been hugged close your chest, but there was no warmth there

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:38.340
Your eyes are never to open again, softly and lovingly I feel you

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:47.820
Even when I’m burned to ash in the hellfire, I’ll always be by your side

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.380
I’m right here, for your sake alone

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.940
I’m a doll, forever belonging to you
