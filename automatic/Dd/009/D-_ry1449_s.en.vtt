00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.859
 Hello dear friends my name is 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.490
 Valera the other day I bought such here 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.320
 headphones they are called light and pit 945 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.820
 mv 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.340
 today I would like to review these 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.680
 most headphones here in this box 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:21.600
 we had dreams written here 945 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:25.220
 well then let's get to the very 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:28.949
 review so everything will remove the box here 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:32.059
 not made from glossy plastic 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.980
 plastic as you see everything is so 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:39.930
 is calculated here with our soft 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:43.860
 rim themselves ears and embouchure ki too 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.820
 pretty soft how can you see the ears done 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.980
 so here is shitty 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.800
 in fact it is made specifically for 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.219
 The ear cushions fit well to 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.370
 our head is not yours 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:01:01.170
 long would even say very short 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:03.530
 thin as you see here is such an input 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.330
 three and a half millimeters 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:10.380
 complete and how the microphone is not so 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:13.310
 headphones the microphone itself is located on 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.340
 wire here it is here we have a button for 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.830
 Here I'll show you here is the button for 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.770
 taking a call or losing or 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.369
 pause audio recording set 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.659
 also there is an adapter here it which 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:33.630
 lets our bundled hey entrance 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:36.900
 disconnect on microphone and on yourself 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.730
 headphones but it's for desktops in 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.880
 which 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:42.890
 there are two inputs one for 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.590
 headphones another hole for the microphone 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.960
 well let's go to 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.880
 characteristics of our headphones 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:55.400
 105 decibel monitor sensitivity 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:58.750
 frequency range from 18 to 20 thousand 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:01.910
 hertz resistance 32 ohm 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:07.270
 microphone frequency range 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:10.580
 to the microphone from 30 to 16 thousand hertz and 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:14.560
 sensitivity minus 52 decibels a from 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:19.580
 myself I will say that the microphone where he's waters 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:23.050
 pretty good but there is one minus it 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:27.200
 background background 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:31.240
 the style of such a sand that's something like it 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.880
 so beeps 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.560
 you decide in principle if you will 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.420
 talk on this microphone by 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.430
 skype will do 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.380
 but if you want to record video on 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.600
 youtube it is desirable to choose 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.360
 some other microphone 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.460
 The price of these headphones is 600 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.100
 rubles but I live in a small town 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:54.940
 so in big cities they will 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:58.110
 about 900 rubles from myself I will say 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.640
 that the headphones are pretty good 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.070
 true two hours after 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.560
 uses begin to hurt the ears 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:08.790
 Thank you all for watching with you 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.790
 valera bye bye
