 flow street and we are in a new 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.170
 career with subscribers around the world 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.059
 is slow because I administer 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.490
 miniature and I have also seen that it is 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.500
 a well right floating or something like that 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.660
 let's see if we find it because 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.070
 They looked terrible but but 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.380
 also a pint in fact a ship 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.550
 so that flipas see if the meeting if 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.529
 does not have a little weird voice is that I 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.210
 I am constipated there is the king is something 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.449
 the raid come on let's do it at 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:31.080
 backwards we go yes sir okay let's go 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.430
 mother of mine 8 cast first minute but you get 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.680
 the flow point like the first one does not 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.559
 pierced is to say you have not passed it 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.450
 are you telling me to see to see please 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:42.490
 please because I did everything right but 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.570
 in the fucking damn point dude 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:47.000
 a game carefully now you have to climb 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.740
 we went up and there's the trick there was 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.970
 the trick for the seconds 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:54.620
 there is a bit that is a first pass 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:56.960
 good reality is the first but there is no 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.340
 a payment followed do to the first and the 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.650
 true that it is moving away enough to 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.540
 see if we're lucky it hits it or 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.010
 we are faster than him and he 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.990
 we can trim my mother's slow and 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.240
 this white month doing some bundles that 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.590
 they are not normal, worth, you have to return 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.560
 you have to come back here I trusted to overtake you 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.750
 in the air, okay, let's go 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.270
 come on come on let's go well flow a 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.520
 boy that went to that shit dude the 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:22.149
 lamppost the lamp post apart from giving me 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.470
 second I have advanced to the uncle that I think 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:25.570
 that takes a little distance but 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.399
 the first one I do not have nor far no longer what 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:32.640
 I have not far away, uncle, I need to catch him 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:32.640
 but already since with a whole stadium 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.770
 I wanted to comment that many of you are 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:40.630
 asking about the secondary channel and 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.890
 then also for the secondary but 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.230
 for people who also follow me in 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.240
 this channel the theme of the series that does not 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.040
 I left but they give me a thousand problems 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.630
 the recording program and I can not then 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.250
 continue it but we worry that I think 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.210
 that tomorrow has happened and I can 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.560
 solve because you already format the 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.300
 computer so good we continue 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.640
 guys I do not want to roll here with others 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.440
 issues we go second 1 or then then 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.300
 then it has exploded it has been said the 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.740
 entities there is worth seeing I do not have 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.880
 weapons has delivery of the handsome gta to 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.830
 destroy him because if he is not going to catch me 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.390
 and he's going to overtake me and we do not want that 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.070
 nobody although good if I face and 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.170
 we caught the slipstream the eye can be 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.790
 until good to catch ahead we 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.920
 will give you unclean pegs you want a bank 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.660
 I want as I go ahead and here another goal 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.850
 root of these aerial truth these 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.830
 wallride to see seem easy because 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.239
 They are very wide but afterwards you have to see 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.830
 where is the point because then it happens to you 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.270
 what happened to me that does not catch is the 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.920
 point and the shit look there goes around there goes 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.000
 to bring first, it's worth, okay, I think 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.830
 that you can catch if you screw it in the 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.510
 wall red only once I can overtake 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.980

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:50.030
 the human being that I do in all lad 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.860
 of shit is overtaking him as 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.900
 be 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.340
 is that lately it's like the 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.230
 subscribers are too seated and 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.820
 as it is in front no longer the shafts but 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.410
 no joke every time you get more time 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.320
 and more time and more time and we carry 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:06.230
 I'm going to wear it down to shit and 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.480
 to shit on a scrap that no no 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.770
 it is normal not normal or normal worth 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.139
 ok or you play the game a little bit there 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.480
 it's worth the pierre flow ramp accelerates 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:16.460
 accelerates accelerates finished vale and the 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.680
 first and the second is here in front 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.080
 mine and in the end I will win and I do not want 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.169
 that happens 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.050
 faster we go 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:29.569
 giving away with raid 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:33.569
 yes I think I think there are many guys 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:36.330
 but I shit on all uncle entered the 

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:38.699
 uncle's goal has entered the male goal 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:42.030
 or like an ally like the liver 

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:45.260
 uncle twice in a row in addition 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:48.440
 to him already twice in a row uncle 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:51.780
 Okay, I thought I had finished 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:53.639
 because it has gone down as not very 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:55.010
 you're kids and let's see if everything 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:57.650
 world knows that you are going to enter mate 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:06:00.210
 everyone knows that you are going to enter and 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:02.010
 we are in third position the truth 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.150
 which is a pretty bad result because 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:04.980
 and besides I wanted to win the 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.389
 career is that he wore the second whole 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:08.100
 the time in front and in fact and several 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:10.200
 seconds too much of the 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.490
 race but then by a stroke of 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.500
 karma because it had been played has been 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:16.860
 played by a stroke of karma flesh 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:18.450
 because the shit or there is in the walk reitman 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.190
 advanced more here the time and then already 

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:22.950
 when to overtake it again then another 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:24.510
 the ally has beaten me but good 

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:25.800
 guys are like that the races so 

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.150
 good if you liked it you can leave a 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.490

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:30.570
 guys that's good that way down there then 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:32.250
 you will also have the secondary channel 

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:34.620
 so you can go there, see it 

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:35.790
