 Lego designers today in my 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:13.650
 the program is such a set of 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:17.580
 new series of lego bionicle from second 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.050
 half of 2015 most recently they 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.300

 steel skull and it has 171 parts 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.670
 look faster screensaver and i will be it 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.670
 unpack 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.540
 this box is no because there is tricky 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:50.520
 forms like I had last time a 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:54.360
 rectangular so pretty familiar 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:58.010
 Zadie painted box functionality itself 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.470
 maker mass to steel skull mask 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:04.309
 the creation of all this we will see in the set 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.460
 here you can find out what happens when 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:10.650
 compound 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:12.810
 of this set with a set of 70 794 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.110
 you can get this cool 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.350
 combo monster then let's open 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.590
 the more so as they are places for 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.539
 opening the box 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:28.500
 hiding it from the bottom above not 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:33.810
 the bag with the details opens 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:35.490
 number one sachet number two details on 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.500
 in fact , the numbers they did not finish 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:43.830
 give numbers 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:46.320
 third instruction package and that's it 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:49.170
 Now I will collect this kit and 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.180
 I'll be back with a review of what 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.659
 It turned out the first thing that catches your eye 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.790
 at the sight of this set it is its size i 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.920
 honestly could not even imagine 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.110
 that all that comes from this box 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.150
 will be so big 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.420
 Now we take a closer look at these guys. 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.549
 but I'll start the lubrication of the universe here 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.179
 cool mask of golden color on 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:12.390
 which the 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.579
 drawn different runes on different 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.000
 perfect or places very cool 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:20.430
 looks and is on special 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.890
 because it is the fight 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.170
 in this set let's take a look at the most 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.850
 he is the creator of the masks 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.799
 special guard mask which 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.620
 still removed very easily when 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:36.600
 such a mechanism is very helpful 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:38.430
 cool mask very beautiful guard himself 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.820
 made here in such transparent ones 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:45.810
 blue and silver colors and the protection of the 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:48.209
 he is looking for gold in one hand 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.160
 with rotating blades 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.600
 blades 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:57.800
 however here you can rotate 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:03:02.570
 second hand, that is, everything here rotates 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:05.660
 on the hinge checks feet also by itself on 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:07.550
 hinges and this hand is hinged all but 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:12.230
 with this mechanism 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:14.480
 moving this joint here 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.030
 I donâ€™t know what's done here. 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.700
 there were some more gears possible 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:23.510
 for it to be tighter 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:27.200
 movement and it could have been easier to keep 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.990
 arm position so she is good 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.090
 held such principle did not fall 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:34.820
 periodically apply in general very 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.250
 movable figure can be in a bunch of different 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.350
 poses and put a second weapon about which 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.440
 I haven't said anything yet 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:46.010
 special hammer with rapid-fire 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.630
 shooters it is better to put the opposite not 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.510
 since i have it now 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:53.090
 and so because all these things here 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.700
 they shoot in general hammer machines 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:04:02.030
 Gan what could be cooler want to beat 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:05.840
 do you want to shoot a steel skull just 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:08.680
 huge very cool character too with 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:11.360
 its special mask which is also easy 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:15.040
 removed there are such here 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:18.410
 the horns are therefore a bit like 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.900
 some devilish creation but 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.510
 It looks very cool at the same time 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.150
 rib cage unique detail here 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.130
 here itself this chest plate too 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:31.550
 unique bone detail he has 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.680
 silver paws are awesome protection too 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:37.790
 such impressive sizes here these 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:39.620
 plates both on the feet and on the arms exactly 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.830
 the same hands 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.830
 orange like chest in 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.810
 overall men cool atmospheric 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.800
 made this character he move 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.160
 both hands 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.680
 through the mechanism 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.260
 except that everything is natural for all to 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:00.440
 hinges and a figure you can put 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:03.890
 in any position as you want in general 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:07.070
 absolutely I will tell you about his weapons 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:10.040
 this is such a huge sword with a hook 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:13.310
 but this thing is even cooler 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:16.040
 ax consisting of three blades in different 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:19.160
 the sides he is huge and here such 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.650
 here is an interesting detail 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.420
 thin here these 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:27.440
 plate glasses on thin septum 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:30.260
 that allow her to bend herself 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:32.060
 without any harm and here it is 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.270
 space it can expand and 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.510
 narrow down which basically allows 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.120
 steal 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:40.490
 masks, if desired, that is, you can 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:43.430
 take and and and directly pull off and not 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:46.520
 only from the stand but also straight from your 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:48.650
 the opponent is very cool i think this 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.850
 You can do many more things 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.250
 things besides 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:55.400
 tightening the masks so come on now 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:58.610
 try something harder you 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.690
 see try to cook but myself 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.420
 omelette this thing 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:04.820
 what are you friends how do you see lego sets 

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:07.100
 bionicle still please still 

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.680
 very interesting and as always have 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:12.169
 huge gaming potential and huge 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:15.860
 opportunities for various customization and 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:19.280
 homemade but build this one here 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:21.669
 cool thing is also very, very much like 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:25.040
 there are some cool ones in this set 

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:28.790
 interesting details especially for those who 

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:31.870
 loves the bionicle series with all that 

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:34.550
 associated with these series and especially me 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:37.010
 interested in small fasteners NER 

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:39.080
 which I had not seen before but which 

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:41.270
 itself has quite a lot of potential 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:44.000
 let's see how it will be used in 

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:46.310
 a series of techniques if you write of course 

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.560
