00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.550 
doing you can see in front and behind
all<00:02:00.610> directions<00:02:01.150> as<00:02:01.600> I<00:02:01.630> is<00:02:01.840> very<00:02:02.229> similar<00:02:02.440> to

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
all directions as I is very similar to

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.520 
all directions as I is very similar to
us<00:02:02.770> it<00:02:03.340> also<00:02:03.580> has<00:02:04.740> sensory<00:02:05.740> line<00:02:07.229> runs<00:02:08.229> right

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
us it also has sensory line runs right

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:14.070 
us it also has sensory line runs right
down<00:02:09.010> here<00:02:09.899> follow<00:02:10.899> the<00:02:11.020> lateral<00:02:11.740> line<00:02:13.080> so

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
down here follow the lateral line so

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.260 
down here follow the lateral line so
when<00:02:14.320> the<00:02:14.530> bear<00:02:14.800> is<00:02:15.160> in<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.370> water<00:02:15.550> splash

splash<00:02:16.720> splash<00:02:17.370> it<00:02:18.370> creates<00:02:18.760> vibrations<00:02:19.510> and

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
splash splash it creates vibrations and

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:27.960 
splash splash it creates vibrations and
feel<00:02:20.709> the<00:02:20.890> vibrations<00:02:21.550> turns<00:02:22.450> to<00:02:22.690> up<00:02:26.970> what

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
feel the vibrations turns to up what

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:35.690 
feel the vibrations turns to up what
else<00:02:30.480> mouth<00:02:31.480> what<00:02:31.750> do<00:02:31.840> we<00:02:31.900> use<00:02:32.019> our<00:02:32.110> mouth<00:02:32.260> for
