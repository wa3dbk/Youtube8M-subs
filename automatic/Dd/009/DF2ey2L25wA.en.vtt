to be uploading all of the new missions
I<00:00:13.679> did<00:00:13.920> plan<00:00:14.190> on<00:00:14.429> doing<00:00:14.730> that<00:00:14.759> back<00:00:15.150> when<00:00:15.299> I

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
I did plan on doing that back when I

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.580 
I did plan on doing that back when I
thought<00:00:15.599> that<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.900> payoffs<00:00:16.260> were<00:00:16.350> going<00:00:16.529> to

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
thought that the payoffs were going to

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.320 
thought that the payoffs were going to
be<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.710> lot<00:00:16.980> higher<00:00:17.190> than<00:00:17.250> they<00:00:17.670> are<00:00:17.699> if<00:00:18.180> you

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
be a lot higher than they are if you

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.640 
be a lot higher than they are if you
don't<00:00:18.510> know<00:00:18.660> already<00:00:18.690> none<00:00:19.260> of<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.470> new

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
don't know already none of the new

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.230 
don't know already none of the new
missions<00:00:20.039> broke<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.609> top<00:00:20.789> ten<00:00:21.060> highest

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
missions broke the top ten highest

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.090 
missions broke the top ten highest
paying<00:00:21.600> missions<00:00:22.080> none<00:00:22.410> of<00:00:22.560> them<00:00:22.680> even<00:00:22.769> broke

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
paying missions none of them even broke

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.460 
paying missions none of them even broke
the<00:00:23.279> top<00:00:23.460> 25<00:00:23.910> highest<00:00:24.539> paying<00:00:24.720> missions<00:00:25.199> and

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
the top 25 highest paying missions and

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.870 
the top 25 highest paying missions and
all<00:00:25.619> of<00:00:25.769> them<00:00:25.859> have<00:00:26.039> low<00:00:26.189> opens<00:00:26.609> at<00:00:26.699> rank

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
all of them have low opens at rank

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.490 
all of them have low opens at rank
levels<00:00:27.300> so<00:00:27.570> due<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.019> fact<00:00:28.140> that<00:00:28.289> they

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
levels so due to the fact that they

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.290 
levels so due to the fact that they
don't<00:00:28.710> pay<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:28.920> lot<00:00:29.220> I<00:00:29.400> probably<00:00:29.670> won't<00:00:30.119> be

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
don't pay a lot I probably won't be

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.150 
don't pay a lot I probably won't be
uploading<00:00:30.570> all<00:00:30.869> of<00:00:31.080> them<00:00:31.199> I<00:00:31.349> may<00:00:31.529> upload<00:00:31.800> a

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
my opinion and I base that solely on the

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.930 
my opinion and I base that solely on the
objectives<00:00:46.770> not<00:00:46.829> on<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.160> money<00:00:47.340> payout<00:00:47.730> or

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
objectives not on the money payout or

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.760 
objectives not on the money payout or
the<00:00:48.059> RP<00:00:48.390> payout<00:00:48.750> but<00:00:49.079> strictly<00:00:49.469> on<00:00:49.739> the

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
the RP payout but strictly on the

the RP payout but strictly on the
objectives<00:00:50.520> like<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:50.969> said<00:00:51.030> none<00:00:51.360> of<00:00:51.480> them<00:00:51.570> have

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
objectives like I said none of them have

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.990 
objectives like I said none of them have
good<00:00:51.930> payouts<00:00:52.440> but<00:00:52.800> couple<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.430> more<00:00:53.699> pretty

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
good payouts but couple of more pretty

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.819 
good payouts but couple of more pretty
fun<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.360> do<00:00:54.539> so<00:00:54.899> if<00:00:55.199> you're<00:00:55.350> bored<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.710> doing

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
fun to do so if you're bored of doing

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.470 
fun to do so if you're bored of doing
the<00:00:56.010> same<00:00:56.190> old<00:00:56.399> missions<00:00:56.820> over<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.210> over<00:00:57.329> I

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
the same old missions over and over I

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.000 
the same old missions over and over I
would<00:00:57.719> definitely<00:00:57.870> recommend<00:00:58.109> doing<00:00:58.710> this

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
would definitely recommend doing this

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.770 
would definitely recommend doing this
one<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.489> doesn't<00:00:59.820> take<00:00:59.910> long<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.149> do<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.660> basic

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
one it doesn't take long to do the basic

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.680 
one it doesn't take long to do the basic
objective<00:01:01.440> is<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:02.070> go<00:01:02.250> to<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.489> crime<00:01:02.879> scene<00:01:02.910> kill

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
objective is to go to a crime scene kill

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.690 
objective is to go to a crime scene kill
the<00:01:03.809> police<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.290> are<00:01:04.439> there<00:01:04.650> still<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.250> bag<00:01:05.519> of

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
the police that are there still a bag of

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.730 
the police that are there still a bag of
cash<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.450> return<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:06.990> Lester's<00:01:07.380> warehouse

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
cash and return it to Lester's warehouse

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.620 
cash and return it to Lester's warehouse
so<00:01:08.189> basically<00:01:08.610> you're<00:01:08.760> making<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.060> crime<00:01:09.330> scene

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
so basically you're making a crime scene

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.870 
so basically you're making a crime scene
at<00:01:09.930> an<00:01:10.080> existing<00:01:10.619> crime<00:01:10.950> scene<00:01:11.280> which<00:01:11.549> is<00:01:11.700> some

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
at an existing crime scene which is some

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.520 
at an existing crime scene which is some
dough<00:01:12.060> shitake<00:01:12.540> if<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:12.990> think<00:01:13.229> about<00:01:13.350> it

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
dough shitake if you think about it

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.109 
dough shitake if you think about it
another<00:01:14.010> thing<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.340> like<00:01:14.460> about<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:14.790> mission

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
another thing I like about this mission

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.420 
another thing I like about this mission
is<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.479> crime<00:01:15.840> scene<00:01:16.229> er<00:01:16.259> it's<00:01:16.710> located<00:01:17.100> in<00:01:17.310> a

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
missions now I've only played this

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.240 
missions now I've only played this
mission<00:02:19.020> a<00:02:19.080> handful<00:02:19.410> of<00:02:19.440> times<00:02:19.740> so<00:02:20.190> I'm

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
mission a handful of times so I'm

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.710 
mission a handful of times so I'm
certain<00:02:20.550> there's<00:02:20.700> other<00:02:20.820> approaches<00:02:21.240> that<00:02:21.660> I

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
certain there's other approaches that I

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.420 
certain there's other approaches that I
haven't<00:02:22.050> had<00:02:22.110> time<00:02:22.170> to<00:02:22.380> try<00:02:22.680> out<00:02:22.710> yet<00:02:23.130> when<00:02:23.340> it

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
haven't had time to try out yet when it

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.740 
haven't had time to try out yet when it
comes<00:02:23.580> to<00:02:23.700> doing<00:02:23.850> this<00:02:24.030> mission<00:02:24.420> but<00:02:24.600> I<00:02:24.630> do

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
comes to doing this mission but I do

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.270 
comes to doing this mission but I do
know<00:02:25.050> that<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.350> approach<00:02:25.650> I<00:02:25.800> used<00:02:26.010> in<00:02:26.160> this

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
know that the approach I used in this

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.340 
know that the approach I used in this
video<00:02:26.460> seems<00:02:27.060> to<00:02:27.180> be<00:02:27.300> pretty<00:02:27.510> consistent<00:02:28.200> and

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
video seems to be pretty consistent and

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.720 
video seems to be pretty consistent and
the<00:02:28.410> reason<00:02:28.650> i<00:02:28.710> like<00:02:28.890> going<00:02:29.010> this<00:02:29.250> way<00:02:29.460> is

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
the reason i like going this way is

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:30.800 
the reason i like going this way is
because<00:02:29.880> there's<00:02:30.420> a<00:02:30.480> lot<00:02:30.660> of<00:02:30.690> different

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
because there's a lot of different

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.360 
because there's a lot of different
tunnels<00:02:31.200> and<00:02:31.590> a<00:02:31.650> lot<00:02:31.860> of<00:02:31.980> different<00:02:32.250> bridges

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
tunnels and a lot of different bridges

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:33.860 
tunnels and a lot of different bridges
you<00:02:32.610> can<00:02:32.760> hide<00:02:32.940> under<00:02:32.970> that<00:02:33.510> will<00:02:33.630> help<00:02:33.750> you

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
you can hide under that will help you

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.990 
you can hide under that will help you
lose<00:02:34.050> the<00:02:34.200> cops<00:02:34.410> and<00:02:34.830> not<00:02:34.980> only<00:02:35.130> that<00:02:35.280> going<00:02:35.910> in

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
lose the cops and not only that going in

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.310 
lose the cops and not only that going in
this<00:02:36.120> direction<00:02:36.180> leads<00:02:36.750> you<00:02:36.900> straight<00:02:36.960> to

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
this direction leads you straight to

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.960 
this direction leads you straight to
Lester's<00:02:37.650> warehouse<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.370> that<00:02:38.520> allows<00:02:38.760> you

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
Lester's warehouse and that allows you

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.430 
Lester's warehouse and that allows you
to<00:02:39.000> lose<00:02:39.240> the<00:02:39.390> cops<00:02:39.570> and<00:02:39.840> go<00:02:40.050> to<00:02:40.110> Lester's

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
to lose the cops and go to Lester's

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.350 
to lose the cops and go to Lester's
warehouse<00:02:40.770> simultaneously<00:02:41.640> so<00:02:41.940> that's<00:02:42.150> one

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
warehouse simultaneously so that's one

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.550 
warehouse simultaneously so that's one
of<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:42.540> reasons<00:02:42.810> why<00:02:42.930> like<00:02:43.110> going<00:02:43.320> in<00:02:43.440> this

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
of the reasons why like going in this

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:44.660 
of the reasons why like going in this
direction<00:02:43.620> but<00:02:44.160> I'm<00:02:44.280> pretty<00:02:44.430> sure<00:02:44.550> there's

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
direction but I'm pretty sure there's

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.550 
direction but I'm pretty sure there's
lots<00:02:45.000> of<00:02:45.150> different<00:02:45.240> other<00:02:45.600> ways<00:02:45.690> as<00:02:45.840> well<00:02:46.050> did

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
lots of different other ways as well did

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.960 
lots of different other ways as well did
I<00:02:46.590> haven't<00:02:46.860> tried<00:02:47.040> yet<00:02:47.280> and<00:02:47.520> as<00:02:47.610> for<00:02:47.790> rooftop

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
I haven't tried yet and as for rooftop

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.060 
I haven't tried yet and as for rooftop
rumble<00:02:48.330> yes<00:02:48.660> it<00:02:48.840> has<00:02:48.990> been<00:02:49.140> tweaked<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:49.860> yes

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
rumble yes it has been tweaked and yes

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.170 
rumble yes it has been tweaked and yes
it's<00:02:50.310> going<00:02:50.490> to<00:02:50.550> take<00:02:50.670> you<00:02:50.790> a<00:02:50.820> little<00:02:50.970> bit

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
it's going to take you a little bit

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.760

longer<00:02:51.330> but<00:02:51.690> I<00:02:51.750> really<00:02:52.110> don't<00:02:52.290> consider<00:02:52.560> it<00:02:52.650> a

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:52.770 
longer but I really don't consider it a

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:54.440 
longer but I really don't consider it a
big<00:02:52.980> deal<00:02:53.160> instead<00:02:53.610> of<00:02:53.640> two<00:02:53.880> minutes<00:02:54.180> it<00:02:54.300> might

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
big deal instead of two minutes it might

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.030 
big deal instead of two minutes it might
take<00:02:54.630> you<00:02:54.720> 30<00:02:54.870> minutes<00:02:55.170> and<00:02:55.530> i'll<00:02:55.650> upload<00:02:55.920> a
