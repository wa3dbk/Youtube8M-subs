that I placed are gone here out of
curiosity<00:00:41.540> let's<00:00:42.540> go<00:00:42.629> ahead<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:42.870> put<00:00:43.050> some

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
curiosity let's go ahead and put some

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.180 
curiosity let's go ahead and put some
steps<00:00:43.440> down<00:00:43.620> here<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:45.469> make<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.500> line<00:00:46.829> here

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
steps down here and make a line here

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.350 
steps down here and make a line here
let's<00:00:47.370> see<00:00:47.460> where<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.670> cuts<00:00:47.910> off<00:00:48.090> because

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
let's see where it cuts off because

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.639 
let's see where it cuts off because
there<00:00:48.450> must<00:00:48.570> be<00:00:48.750> there<00:00:49.050> must<00:00:49.200> be<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.320> cut<00:00:49.559> off

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
there must be there must be a cut off

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:57.139 
there must be there must be a cut off
here<00:00:50.840> where<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.930> steps<00:00:52.199> cut<00:00:52.440> off<00:00:52.559> at<00:00:53.239> em<00:00:56.149> let's

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
here where the steps cut off at em let's

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:07.070 
here where the steps cut off at em let's
do<00:00:57.270> over<00:00:57.510> here<00:00:57.719> too<00:01:03.799> and<00:01:04.799> then<00:01:05.400> maybe<00:01:06.210> on<00:01:06.869> top

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
do over here too and then maybe on top

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.830 
do over here too and then maybe on top
of<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.320> building<00:01:07.470> as<00:01:07.680> well<00:01:09.979> like<00:01:10.979> here<00:01:11.840> there

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
of the building as well like here there

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.670 
of the building as well like here there
you<00:01:12.960> go<00:01:13.880> it<00:01:14.880> may<00:01:15.630> be<00:01:15.689> it's<00:01:15.869> chunk<00:01:16.229> based<00:01:16.500> I

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
you go it may be it's chunk based I

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.999 
you go it may be it's chunk based I
can't<00:01:16.890> quite<00:01:17.040> tell<00:01:17.689> all<00:01:18.689> right<00:01:18.960> let's<00:01:19.439> exit

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
can't quite tell all right let's exit

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.679 
can't quite tell all right let's exit
and<00:01:20.130> reenter<00:01:21.049> and<00:01:22.909> okay<00:01:23.909> so<00:01:23.970> we're<00:01:24.360> missing

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
and reenter and okay so we're missing

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.480 
and reenter and okay so we're missing
some<00:01:24.930> steps<00:01:25.200> again<00:01:26.750> looks<00:01:27.750> like<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.979> they've

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
some steps again looks like and they've

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.270 
some steps again looks like and they've
cut<00:01:29.880> off<00:01:30.060> here<00:01:30.990> okay<00:01:31.439> so<00:01:31.500> there's<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.950> border

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
cut off here okay so there's the border

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.210 
cut off here okay so there's the border
right<00:01:32.460> there<00:01:32.909> this<00:01:33.900> is<00:01:33.990> very<00:01:34.170> strange<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:35.009> don't
