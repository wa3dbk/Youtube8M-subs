you<00:00:24.359> can<00:00:24.539> breathe<00:00:25.609> well<00:00:26.609> it's<00:00:26.970> like<00:00:27.180> yesterday

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
you can breathe well it's like yesterday

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.790 
you can breathe well it's like yesterday
do<00:00:28.590> it<00:00:28.800> was<00:00:28.920> like<00:00:29.130> it's<00:00:30.119> only<00:00:30.570> December<00:00:31.410> but<00:00:31.679> it

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
do it was like it's only December but it

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.040 
do it was like it's only December but it
was<00:00:31.920> like<00:00:32.099> molasses<00:00:32.700> in<00:00:32.820> January<00:00:33.360> it<00:00:33.719> was

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
was like molasses in January it was

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.020 
was like molasses in January it was
thick<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:34.950> was<00:00:35.070> like<00:00:35.399> there<00:00:35.640> was<00:00:35.670> like<00:00:36.000> a

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
thick it was like there was like a

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.750 
thick it was like there was like a
heaviness<00:00:36.989> slowing<00:00:37.680> us<00:00:37.829> down<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.309> keeping<00:00:38.610> us

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
heaviness slowing us down and keeping us

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.150 
heaviness slowing us down and keeping us
in<00:00:38.940> motion<00:00:39.329> slowly<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.260> presenting

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
in motion slowly and presenting

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.190 
in motion slowly and presenting
obstacles<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.030> today<00:00:42.690> as<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.020> Moon<00:00:43.170> moves

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
obstacles and today as the Moon moves

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.740 
obstacles and today as the Moon moves
into<00:00:43.739> Gemini<00:00:44.190> that<00:00:44.460> does<00:00:44.700> open<00:00:45.090> up<00:00:45.210> things<00:00:45.510> on

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
into Gemini that does open up things on

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.470 
into Gemini that does open up things on
its<00:00:46.050> own<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.620> yet<00:00:47.160> we're<00:00:47.340> also<00:00:47.550> separating

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
its own and yet we're also separating

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.350 
its own and yet we're also separating
we're<00:00:48.629> moving<00:00:48.930> away<00:00:49.079> from<00:00:49.320> this<00:00:49.739> hot<00:00:50.250> cold<00:00:50.670> you

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
we're moving away from this hot cold you

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.910 
we're moving away from this hot cold you
know<00:00:51.420> Mars<00:00:51.719> Saturn<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:52.289> was<00:00:52.500> holding<00:00:52.800> us

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
know Mars Saturn that was holding us

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.619 
know Mars Saturn that was holding us
back<00:00:52.949> yesterday<00:00:53.550> so<00:00:54.030> i<00:00:54.059> think<00:00:54.180> that<00:00:54.449> there's

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
back yesterday so i think that there's

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.060 
back yesterday so i think that there's
movement<00:00:54.870> today<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.500> i<00:00:55.530> think<00:00:55.739> we<00:00:55.829> can<00:00:55.949> be

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
movement today and i think we can be

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.790 
movement today and i think we can be
clever<00:00:56.340> about<00:00:56.550> how<00:00:56.699> we<00:00:56.879> do<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:57.379> the<00:00:58.379> primary

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
clever about how we do it the primary

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.860 
clever about how we do it the primary
source<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.579> mobility<00:01:00.180> today<00:01:00.300> i<00:01:00.480> think<00:01:00.600> is<00:01:00.840> that

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
source of mobility today i think is that

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.560 
source of mobility today i think is that
moon<00:01:01.199> shifting<00:01:01.800> into<00:01:02.129> adaptable<00:01:02.940> mutable

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
moon shifting into adaptable mutable

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.380 
moon shifting into adaptable mutable
airy<00:01:03.899> gemini<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:05.250> signs<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.760> twins<00:01:06.150> a

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
airy gemini the signs of the twins a

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.210 
airy gemini the signs of the twins a
sign<00:01:06.600> of<00:01:06.750> multiplicity<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:08.040> really

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
sign of multiplicity and that really

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.359 
sign of multiplicity and that really
lightens<00:01:08.850> things<00:01:09.180> up<00:01:09.479> after<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:10.500> molasses<00:01:11.220> of

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
lightens things up after the molasses of

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.550 
lightens things up after the molasses of
the<00:01:11.490> moon<00:01:11.670> in<00:01:11.909> taurus<00:01:12.270> but<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:12.630> know<00:01:12.810> the

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
the moon in taurus but you know the

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.840 
the moon in taurus but you know the
heavy<00:01:14.549> Mars<00:01:15.150> Saturn<00:01:16.189> semi-square<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.610> we

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
heavy Mars Saturn semi-square that we

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.730 
heavy Mars Saturn semi-square that we
talked<00:01:18.150> about<00:01:18.270> yesterday<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:19.530> happened

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
talked about yesterday that happened

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.770 
talked about yesterday that happened
late<00:01:20.130> last<00:01:20.159> night<00:01:20.700> I<00:01:20.729> think<00:01:21.060> it's<00:01:21.210> still<00:01:21.479> with

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
late last night I think it's still with

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.499 
late last night I think it's still with
us<00:01:21.810> today<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.890> rules<00:01:23.250> are<00:01:23.729> there<00:01:23.970> but<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.270> think

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
us today the rules are there but I think

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.300 
us today the rules are there but I think
we<00:01:24.600> can<00:01:24.630> talk<00:01:25.020> our<00:01:25.290> way<00:01:25.350> out<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.920> ticket

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
we can talk our way out of the ticket

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.219 
we can talk our way out of the ticket
today<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:27.000> I<00:01:27.150> think<00:01:27.420> part<00:01:27.630> of<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.869> reason<00:01:27.900> why

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
today and I think part of the reason why

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.719 
today and I think part of the reason why
we<00:01:28.530> talk<00:01:28.740> our<00:01:28.920> way<00:01:28.950> out<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.369> ticket

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
we talk our way out of the ticket

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.539 
we talk our way out of the ticket
obviously<00:01:30.450> as<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.689> moon<00:01:30.840> in<00:01:31.020> Gemini<00:01:31.470> but<00:01:32.070> you

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
obviously as the moon in Gemini but you

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.789 
obviously as the moon in Gemini but you
know<00:01:32.670> yesterday<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.689> predominant<00:01:34.380> energy

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
know yesterday the predominant energy

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.749 
know yesterday the predominant energy
was<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.369> hot<00:01:35.850> cold<00:01:36.240> hot<00:01:36.600> Mars<00:01:37.560> cold<00:01:38.159> Saturn

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
was the hot cold hot Mars cold Saturn

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.230 
was the hot cold hot Mars cold Saturn
today<00:01:39.600> Mars<00:01:40.439> is<00:01:40.619> also<00:01:41.430> hooking<00:01:41.700> up<00:01:42.000> with<00:01:42.180> a

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
today Mars is also hooking up with a

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.289 
today Mars is also hooking up with a
quintile<00:01:42.810> with<00:01:43.200> motormouth<00:01:43.740> mercury<00:01:44.430> and<00:01:44.729> yet

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
quintile with motormouth mercury and yet

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.840 
quintile with motormouth mercury and yet
Mercury's<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:45.930> Sagittarius<00:01:46.680> it's<00:01:47.430> kind<00:01:47.759> of

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
Mercury's and Sagittarius it's kind of

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.120 
Mercury's and Sagittarius it's kind of
like<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.299> that<00:01:48.630> motor<00:01:49.079> mouth<00:01:49.350> looks<00:01:49.740> at<00:01:49.950> the

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
like it that motor mouth looks at the

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.100 
like it that motor mouth looks at the
good<00:01:50.369> news<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:50.880> it<00:01:50.970> can<00:01:51.149> talk<00:01:51.420> its<00:01:51.630> way<00:01:51.780> in<00:01:51.960> and

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
good news and it can talk its way in and

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.260 
good news and it can talk its way in and
out<00:01:52.229> of<00:01:52.259> anything<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:53.310> in<00:01:53.579> this<00:01:53.729> quintile

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
out of anything and in this quintile

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.580 
out of anything and in this quintile
with<00:01:54.630> Mars<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.320> think<00:01:55.920> that<00:01:56.100> we<00:01:56.219> have<00:01:56.430> more

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
with Mars I think that we have more

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.319 
with Mars I think that we have more
flexibility<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.740> use<00:01:59.130> that<00:01:59.159> word<00:01:59.549> but<00:01:59.939> it's

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
flexibility you use that word but it's

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.929 
flexibility you use that word but it's
almost<00:02:00.479> like<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.930> facile<00:02:01.740> pneus<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.399> ability

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
almost like a facile pneus and ability

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.380 
almost like a facile pneus and ability
to<00:02:03.119> move<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.719> we<00:02:03.869> didn't<00:02:04.290> have<00:02:04.369> yesterday

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
to move that we didn't have yesterday
