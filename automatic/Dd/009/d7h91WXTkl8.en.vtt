00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
they come I will go in first detect the

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.060 
they come I will go in first detect the
track<00:01:50.580> and<00:01:51.390> I<00:01:51.510> was<00:01:51.660> study<00:01:51.870> the<00:01:52.050> Rico<00:01:52.440> where<00:01:52.980> the

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
track and I was study the Rico where the

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.590 
track and I was study the Rico where the
that<00:01:53.250> track<00:01:53.490> suitable<00:01:54.060> for<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.270> vehicle

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
that track suitable for the vehicle

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:04.719 
that track suitable for the vehicle
along

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:06.850 

maybe<00:02:05.420> it's<00:02:05.570> easy<00:02:05.780> because<00:02:06.020> I'm<00:02:06.259> an<00:02:06.350> extremely

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
maybe it's easy because I'm an extremely

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.979 
maybe it's easy because I'm an extremely
good<00:02:07.219> driver<00:02:07.549> but<00:02:08.179> I<00:02:08.209> don't<00:02:08.479> think<00:02:08.690> so<00:02:08.869> I<00:02:08.899> think

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
good driver but I don't think so I think

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:10.960 
good driver but I don't think so I think
it's<00:02:09.200> got<00:02:09.319> more<00:02:09.500> to<00:02:09.649> do<00:02:09.800> with<00:02:10.039> this<00:02:10.310> car

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
it's got more to do with this car

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.619 
it's got more to do with this car
the<00:02:11.420> fact<00:02:11.629> we<00:02:12.140> have<00:02:12.170> low<00:02:12.800> gear<00:02:13.069> ratios<00:02:13.550> we<00:02:14.450> have

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:14.629 
the fact we have low gear ratios we have

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:16.119 
the fact we have low gear ratios we have
height<00:02:14.900> adjustment<00:02:15.500> for<00:02:15.650> getting<00:02:15.830> over<00:02:16.040> the
