00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:16.219
 Do you know? No matter which angle you look at Mickey, his ears are two circles. 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:17.259
 Don't believe it 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.600
 Generally we see President Mickey like this 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.130
 Not like this 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.080
 They found this way to be important 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.360
 When Mickey is in 3D, his ears won’t roll with the head 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.860
 But the ear itself will always face the audience. 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.800
 I don't know how to look at him from two angles. 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.419
 Donald Duck 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.200
 Donald Duck is a Nazi 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.160
 Well... not really 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.279
 But in the 1943 cartoon Der Fuehrer's Face (the face of the head) 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.340
 Draw a scene like this 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.240
 This is a promotional video produced by Walt Disney Company. 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.220
 In the nightmare, Donald Duck dreamed of working in his factory in Nazi, Germany. 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.080
 In this film, I even won the Oscar for Best Animated Short Film Award. 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.144
 At the time of his launch 

00:01:04.144 --> 00:01:06.880
 This is the only time Donald Duck has won this award. 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.339
 However, Disney has not let him fully issue 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.180
 Because of his controversial content 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.800
 As early as 1955, Gao Fei was a wife and a child. 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.380
 Interestingly, his wife did not show her face. 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.440
 But she should be a personal class 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.160
 Not a dog like Goofy 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:38.619
 She has five fingers instead of the characters like Disney. 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.820
 In the Go Go movie (A Goofy Movie) launched in 1995 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.583
 Gao Fei once said that she is dead. 

00:01:43.584 --> 00:01:47.460
 This explains why she suddenly disappeared in the cartoon later. 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.660
 Ms. Hannah is one of Disney’s most successful live-action shows. 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.100
 Aired in 2006, starring Miley Sheila 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.419
 But before she still has a few people to apply for this corner 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.280
 Those people include Alexis Texas. 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.840
 (Sorry, green tea really didn't hear her (๑•́ 3 •̀๑)) Sound familiar? 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:10.880
 Maybe before you see this person 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:16.700
 Alexis Texas is a young erotic actress who also debuted in the same year. 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.019
 (I don't watch European and American films, no wonder I don't know (つд⊂)) Today, Alexis Texas is one of the most well-known figures in the porn industry. 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.560
 Disney also likes to make their characters come in their movies. 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.560
 For example, in the snow 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.240
 Le Pei and Fei Lin (Magic) appear in a scene 

00:02:34.248 --> 00:02:36.248
 Mickey appears in another place 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.800
 Miss and rogue can be seen in the 101 loyal dog 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.900
 Donald Duck, Mickey, and Gao Fei appear in the Little Mermaid 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.520
 (I heard that there is also the lion king in this picture.) The magic carpet (Aladdin) and Belle (beauty and the beast) appear in the bell tower geeks. 

00:02:50.797 --> 00:02:52.797
 Stitch doll in Star Silver Island 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.020
 Magic carpet in the frog prince 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.880
 Pinocchio in the hairy 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.480
 There are many, many... 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.460
 The Disney theme park is the most talked about. 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.200
 No more than an impressive castle 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.220
 But they are actually very deceptive, which is often called forced perspective. 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.320
 This means that they are at different distances from the castle 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.239
 Give people a very tall illusion of architecture 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.100
 For example in the magical world of Cinderella Castle 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:32.019
 The bricks and patterns of their buildings are getting bigger and smaller, creating forced perspective. 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.220
 There is a well-known saying that Walt Disney was in his lifetime. 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.920
 The last note I made was about Kurt Russell 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.940
 No one knows why, including Kurt himself 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.280
 But this is true, his name was written in the notes before Walt. 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.700
 Even misspelled into Kirt 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.960
 The last line is written by CIA-Mobley. 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.640
 It should be the child star Roger Mobley. 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:02.880
 A reasonable explanation is that he listed the right actors to play. 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.460
 TV show "Way Down Cellar" 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.020
 This is also mentioned in the notes 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.580
 Another way of saying this is that he was cryopreserved after his death. 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.540
 But this is wrong. After his death, it was a cremation. 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 (this is super long) 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.940
 If you are watching online city legends 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.040
 You must have seen the abandoned Disneyland 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.380
 And... this is true, Disney has two abandoned paradise 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.260
 The first is Discovery Island, closed in 1999 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.219
 The other is the River Country, closed in 2001. 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.020
 Both parks were abandoned but not demolished 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.260
 But don't know why, they didn't close completely 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:51.099
 Some brave people dabbled after many years and took some videos and photos. 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.940
 Reveal the decay and takeover of these park facilities 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.800
 Before Discovery Island closes 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.720
 Disney had planned to team up with developers of the video game Foggy Island series. 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.480
 Building an interactive experience called Myst Island 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.740
 Visitors will explore different locations to unlock puzzles on the island 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.180
 However, this so attractive development has never left the stage of conception. 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.514
 I don't know what you think. 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.780
 But places like this look a bit.... scary 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.300
 (Jinx 吉茵珂丝?!Σ(°Д°;) Tom and Jerry are originally called Jasper &amp; Jinx 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:33.440
 When they first appeared in 1941, Tom Cat was actually called Jarsper. 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.440
 Jerry has no name in the short film. 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.840
 But according to the creator, he was called Jinx at the time. 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.520
 The Goofy dog ​​was originally called Dippy Dawg. 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.539
 Later, it was called George Geef. 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.220
 Finally, he is collectively referred to as Gao Fei. 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:57.140
 Mickey started out as Mortimer Mouse 

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.659
 Donald Duck has always been called Donald Duck 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:04.920
 But his full name is Donald Fauntleroy Duck. 

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.740
 It’s not really the same. 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:16.820
 Many Disney movies have been accused of sexually suggestive messages again and again. 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:21.680
 Most of what I show you is at best just a suspicion. 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.440
 But one is actually true 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:29.480
 In the Lion King, there is a word display of dust 

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.620
 Sex (SEX) 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.360
 Because we all know how dangerous the word sex is. 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.780
 However, according to speculation, he is actually planning to write SFX. 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:39.919
 Abbreviation for a special effects team 

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.940
 I don't know what you think, but it sounds more logical. 

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:48.760
 There is a character in the Little Mermaid that actually erects in a scene. 

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.860
 This scene is in a later version. 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:55.320
 Edited into a sharp knee 

00:06:55.428 --> 00:06:57.428
 In the rescue hero 

00:06:57.428 --> 00:07:03.808
 However, in the movie, there are two frames in a scene that flashed through the sky. 

00:07:03.808 --> 00:07:05.133
 Yes, really 

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:09.680
 But it has been 20 years since I discovered it until now. 

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.720
 It’s hard to say who made it. 

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:16.460
 Although this photo was deleted in a later version
