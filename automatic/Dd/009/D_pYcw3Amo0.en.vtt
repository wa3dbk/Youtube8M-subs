need a high high-pass filter I usually

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.139 
need a high high-pass filter I usually
put<00:01:43.049> one<00:01:43.229> about<00:01:43.500> 80<00:01:43.950> Hertz<00:01:44.960> and<00:01:46.939> then<00:01:47.939> I'm

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
put one about 80 Hertz and then I'm

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.310 
put one about 80 Hertz and then I'm
going<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.329> copy<00:01:48.630> this<00:01:48.960> down<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:50.039> this<00:01:50.189> track

actually<00:01:55.350> eliminate<00:01:55.859> some<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.429> plosives

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
actually eliminate some of the plosives

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.010

pop<00:01:59.009> peas<00:01:59.399> can<00:01:59.880> be<00:02:00.030> pretty<00:02:00.390> petulant<00:02:01.170> simply

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:01.859 
pop peas can be pretty petulant simply

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:04.010 
pop peas can be pretty petulant simply
but<00:02:02.399> in<00:02:02.490> this<00:02:02.609> case<00:02:02.880> I<00:02:03.119> actually<00:02:03.270> emphasize

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
but in this case I actually emphasize

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.620 
but in this case I actually emphasize
the<00:02:04.500> peas<00:02:04.770> so<00:02:05.039> that<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.250> can<00:02:05.399> hear<00:02:05.640> them<00:02:05.850> and

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
the peas so that you can hear them and

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.850 
the peas so that you can hear them and
here's<00:02:09.630> how<00:02:09.750> you<00:02:09.810> take<00:02:10.050> care<00:02:10.320> of<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.650> more

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
here's how you take care of the more

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.360 
here's how you take care of the more
pesky<00:02:11.160> ones

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
pesky ones

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.680

so<00:02:13.300> you<00:02:14.170> zoom<00:02:14.440> in<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:16.030> we<00:02:16.120> can<00:02:16.269> see<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.540> little

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
so you zoom in and we can see the little

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:23.910 
so you zoom in and we can see the little
waveform<00:02:19.349> doing<00:02:20.349> its<00:02:20.470> thing<00:02:21.300> and<00:02:22.530> it<00:02:23.530> starts

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
waveform doing its thing and it starts

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.390 
waveform doing its thing and it starts
about<00:02:24.040> right<00:02:24.580> here<00:02:25.030> I'm<00:02:25.269> going<00:02:25.540> to<00:02:25.629> cut<00:02:25.900> and

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
about right here I'm going to cut and

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
straight line now and I'm going to take

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.520 
straight line now and I'm going to take
this<00:02:34.900> and<00:02:35.200> drag<00:02:35.440> this<00:02:35.650> down<00:02:35.709> to<00:02:36.069> the<00:02:36.220> next

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
harder to see this one okay right right

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:38.530 
harder to see this one okay right right
there's<00:03:28.160> good<00:03:28.490> and<00:03:32.500> there's<00:03:35.350> another<00:03:36.350> one

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
there's good and there's another one

there's good and there's another one
all<00:03:39.530> right<00:03:41.230> now<00:03:42.230> I'm<00:03:42.349> kind<00:03:42.530> of<00:03:42.590> regretting

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
all right now I'm kind of regretting

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:45.369 
all right now I'm kind of regretting
haven't<00:03:43.340> I<00:03:43.810> think<00:03:44.810> so<00:03:44.959> many<00:03:45.170> of<00:03:45.290> these

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:45.379 
haven't I think so many of these

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:47.729 
haven't I think so many of these
actually<00:03:46.340> just<00:03:46.489> to<00:03:46.549> make<00:03:46.700> this<00:03:46.819> video<00:03:47.120> shorter

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
actually just to make this video shorter

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:54.550 
actually just to make this video shorter
so<00:03:48.739> I<00:03:48.769> have<00:03:49.040> four<00:03:49.700> pluses<00:03:50.409> and<00:03:53.200> now<00:03:54.200> what<00:03:54.470> I'm

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
so I have four pluses and now what I'm

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.440 
so I have four pluses and now what I'm
going<00:03:54.680> to<00:03:54.709> do<00:03:54.890> is<00:03:55.190> take<00:03:55.760> this<00:03:55.940> high-pass

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
going to do is take this high-pass

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:02.850 
going to do is take this high-pass
filter<00:03:56.959> and<00:03:57.170> put<00:03:57.200> it<00:03:57.680> up<00:03:57.830> to<00:03:58.750> mmm<00:03:59.840> about<00:04:00.200> 300

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.930 

300<00:04:03.860> Hertz<00:04:04.810> so<00:04:05.810> this<00:04:06.230> lower<00:04:06.530> track<00:04:07.010> track

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
300 Hertz so this lower track track

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.490 
300 Hertz so this lower track track
number<00:04:08.240> 2<00:04:08.800> has<00:04:09.800> a<00:04:09.830> high-pass<00:04:10.670> filter<00:04:11.180> at<00:04:11.720> 300

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
number 2 has a high-pass filter at 300

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.040 
number 2 has a high-pass filter at 300
Hertz<00:04:12.710> and<00:04:13.010> the<00:04:13.850> original<00:04:14.180> track<00:04:14.540> has<00:04:14.810> it<00:04:14.960> at

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
Hertz and the original track has it at

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.900 
Hertz and the original track has it at
80<00:04:15.260> Hertz<00:04:15.760> 80<00:04:16.760> Hertz<00:04:16.940> is<00:04:17.150> just<00:04:17.390> my<00:04:17.859> typical

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
80 Hertz 80 Hertz is just my typical

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.660 
80 Hertz 80 Hertz is just my typical
setting<00:04:19.910> for<00:04:20.180> vocals<00:04:20.780> or<00:04:21.019> voiceovers<00:04:21.739> it<00:04:22.340> just

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:22.670 
setting for vocals or voiceovers it just

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.550 
setting for vocals or voiceovers it just
gets<00:04:22.850> rid<00:04:23.180> of<00:04:23.300> a<00:04:23.360> lot<00:04:23.540> of<00:04:23.570> that<00:04:23.780> low-end<00:04:24.320> that's

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
gets rid of a lot of that low-end that's

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.370 
gets rid of a lot of that low-end that's
not<00:04:24.830> really<00:04:25.040> necessary

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
not really necessary

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.670 
not really necessary
and<00:04:27.610> what<00:04:28.610> this<00:04:28.790> does<00:04:29.090> is<00:04:29.540> it<00:04:29.900> makes<00:04:30.140> it<00:04:30.530> so

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
and what this does is it makes it so

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.250 
and what this does is it makes it so
that<00:04:30.710> your<00:04:30.890> pop<00:04:31.160> peas<00:04:31.720> don't<00:04:32.720> have<00:04:32.840> any<00:04:33.020> base

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
that your pop peas don't have any base

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.300 
that your pop peas don't have any base
information<00:04:34.870> pop<00:04:35.870> peas<00:04:36.290> can<00:04:36.770> be<00:04:36.920> pretty

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
information pop peas can be pretty

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.630 
information pop peas can be pretty
petulant<00:04:38.060> simply<00:04:38.810> put<00:04:39.110> there<00:04:39.530> are<00:04:39.560> pests<00:04:39.890> okay

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:40.640

so<00:04:41.390> I'm<00:04:41.540> actually<00:04:41.750> going<00:04:41.990> to<00:04:42.050> bump<00:04:42.260> this<00:04:42.410> up

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
so I'm actually going to bump this up

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.060 
so I'm actually going to bump this up
until<00:04:44.720> I<00:04:44.810> can<00:04:44.990> actually<00:04:45.170> talk<00:04:45.560> and<00:04:45.590> get<00:04:45.830> rid<00:04:45.980> of

okay so that's before and now here's
what<00:05:48.290> the<00:05:48.410> filter<00:05:48.910> pop<00:05:49.910> peas<00:05:50.330> can<00:05:50.810> be<00:05:50.960> pretty

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:51.350 
what the filter pop peas can be pretty

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:55.120 
what the filter pop peas can be pretty
petulant<00:05:52.100> simple<00:05:52.760> there<00:05:52.910> we<00:05:53.060> go<00:05:53.210> gone<00:05:54.130> like

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.130 
petulant simple there we go gone like

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:57.760

magic<00:05:55.160> like<00:05:55.880> I<00:05:56.870> said<00:05:57.050> you<00:05:57.170> might<00:05:57.320> want<00:05:57.530> to<00:05:57.590> bump

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
magic like I said you might want to bump

magic like I said you might want to bump
it<00:05:57.890> up<00:05:57.980> maybe<00:05:58.250> like<00:05:58.520> 2<00:05:58.700> decibels<00:05:59.090> because<00:05:59.630> when

00:05:59.770 --> 00:05:59.780 
it up maybe like 2 decibels because when

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.200 
it up maybe like 2 decibels because when
you<00:05:59.900> eliminate<00:06:00.080> the<00:06:00.350> low<00:06:00.620> end<00:06:00.830> it<00:06:01.700> does<00:06:01.940> bring

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.210 
you eliminate the low end it does bring

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.200 
you eliminate the low end it does bring
the<00:06:02.330> volume<00:06:02.540> down<00:06:02.660> for<00:06:03.080> the<00:06:03.140> second<00:06:03.440> track<00:06:04.210> pop
