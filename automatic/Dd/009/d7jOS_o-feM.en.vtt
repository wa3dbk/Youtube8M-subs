them<00:00:42.149> at<00:00:42.270> Kmart<00:00:42.719> but<00:00:43.050> there's<00:00:43.379> definitely<00:00:43.530> not

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
them at Kmart but there's definitely not

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.610 
them at Kmart but there's definitely not
as<00:00:44.070> great<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.430> variety<00:00:45.030> there<00:00:45.180> so<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:45.899> highly

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
as great a variety there so I highly

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.020 
as great a variety there so I highly
recommend<00:00:46.649> ordering<00:00:47.460> them<00:00:47.610> off<00:00:47.760> sharing

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
recommend ordering them off sharing

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.940 
recommend ordering them off sharing
culture<00:00:48.329> when<00:00:48.450> they're<00:00:48.539> on<00:00:48.629> sale<00:00:48.989> I<00:00:49.230> think

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
culture when they're on sale I think

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.040 
culture when they're on sale I think
they<00:00:50.070> end<00:00:50.190> up<00:00:50.309> being<00:00:50.550> like<00:00:50.730> two<00:00:51.329> dollars<00:00:51.510> or

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
they end up being like two dollars or

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.439 
they end up being like two dollars or
something<00:00:52.379> crazy<00:00:52.530> so<00:00:53.280> so<00:00:53.940> let's<00:00:54.180> start<00:00:54.390> off

how am I ever gonna wear that it's one
of<00:02:22.930> those<00:02:22.989> things<00:02:23.230> if<00:02:23.530> you<00:02:23.560> put<00:02:23.890> it<00:02:23.980> on<00:02:24.100> with

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
of those things if you put it on with

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.590 
of those things if you put it on with
like<00:02:24.370> a<00:02:24.400> light<00:02:24.670> hand<00:02:25.000> it<00:02:25.180> actually<00:02:25.450> looks

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
like a light hand it actually looks

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.260 
like a light hand it actually looks
really<00:02:25.660> pretty<00:02:25.989> and<00:02:26.370> it<00:02:27.370> actually<00:02:27.730> turns<00:02:28.150> into

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
really pretty and it actually turns into

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.890 
really pretty and it actually turns into
kind<00:02:28.690> of<00:02:28.780> a<00:02:28.840> neutral<00:02:30.360> so<00:02:31.360> the<00:02:31.480> next<00:02:31.630> one<00:02:31.780> is<00:02:31.870> a

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
kind of a neutral so the next one is a

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.720 
kind of a neutral so the next one is a
really<00:02:32.200> light<00:02:32.530> sheet<00:02:32.860> shade<00:02:33.370> and<00:02:33.640> I<00:02:33.700> think

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
really light sheet shade and I think

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.640 
really light sheet shade and I think
this<00:02:34.000> is<00:02:34.150> more<00:02:34.300> of<00:02:34.390> a<00:02:34.450> satin<00:02:34.750> might<00:02:35.260> be<00:02:35.380> a<00:02:35.410> matte

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
this is more of a satin might be a matte

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.710 
this is more of a satin might be a matte
