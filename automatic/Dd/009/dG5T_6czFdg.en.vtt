00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
their own and let's say that all four of

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.630 
their own and let's say that all four of
these<00:02:08.239> now<00:02:08.540> grown<00:02:08.929> children<00:02:09.259> also<00:02:10.009> die<00:02:10.250> at<00:02:10.489> the

these now grown children also die at the

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.430 
these now grown children also die at the
same<00:02:10.880> time<00:02:11.209> just<00:02:12.200> for<00:02:12.470> the<00:02:12.590> sake<00:02:12.890> of<00:02:12.920> argument

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
same time just for the sake of argument

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.870 
same time just for the sake of argument
let's<00:02:15.440> say<00:02:15.590> there's<00:02:15.950> an<00:02:16.070> explosion<00:02:16.520> at

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
let's say there's an explosion at

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:23.110 
let's say there's an explosion at
Thanksgiving<00:02:17.510> dinner<00:02:18.760> and<00:02:21.400> these<00:02:22.400> four<00:02:22.820> died

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
Thanksgiving dinner and these four died

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.870 
Thanksgiving dinner and these four died
but<00:02:23.450> their<00:02:23.690> children<00:02:24.200> survived<00:02:24.680> because<00:02:25.520> they

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
but their children survived because they

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:33.040 
but their children survived because they
were<00:02:25.940> seated<00:02:26.239> at<00:02:26.660> the<00:02:27.230> children's<00:02:27.709> table<00:02:30.040> so

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
were seated at the children's table so

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.810 

so<00:02:34.050> now<00:02:34.350> according<00:02:34.800> to<00:02:35.070> the<00:02:35.250> theory<00:02:35.520> these

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
so now according to the theory these

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.550 
so now according to the theory these
four<00:02:36.210> go<00:02:36.360> to<00:02:36.420> heaven<00:02:36.750> and<00:02:36.900> they<00:02:36.960> start<00:02:37.230> helping

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560
