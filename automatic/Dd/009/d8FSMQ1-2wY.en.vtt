I would tell us with them's a lot is

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.540 
I would tell us with them's a lot is
simply<00:00:31.509> information<00:00:32.890> and<00:00:33.890> what<00:00:34.040> lens<00:00:34.250> align

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
simply information and what lens align

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.369 
simply information and what lens align
can<00:00:34.790> do<00:00:34.940> is<00:00:35.239> give<00:00:35.450> you<00:00:35.480> information<00:00:35.870> about<00:00:36.230> the

can do is give you information about the

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:37.869 
can do is give you information about the
state<00:00:36.710> of<00:00:36.739> your<00:00:36.860> focus<00:00:37.340> system<00:00:37.699> at<00:00:37.790> a<00:00:37.820> given

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
state of your focus system at a given

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:46.630 
state of your focus system at a given

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
the focus target that were shooting if

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.610 
the focus target that were shooting if
not<00:00:52.070> the<00:00:52.309> test<00:00:52.550> description<00:00:53.229> first<00:00:54.229> thing<00:00:54.470> was

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:54.620 
not the test description first thing was

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:01.719 
not the test description first thing was
here<00:00:54.830> is<00:00:55.309> just<00:00:55.610> the<00:00:56.420> camera<00:00:56.839> lenses<00:00:58.360> so<00:01:00.729> very

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:01.729 
here is just the camera lenses so very

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:04.910 
here is just the camera lenses so very
roughly

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.639 

do<00:01:05.920> is<00:01:06.100> cold<00:01:06.399> oxide<00:01:07.149> so<00:01:07.930> I<00:01:07.960> come<00:01:08.259> to<00:01:08.290> the<00:01:08.470> wines

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:08.649 
do is cold oxide so I come to the wines

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:10.889 
do is cold oxide so I come to the wines
along<00:01:08.950> this<00:01:09.729> is<00:01:09.790> it<00:01:10.030> the<00:01:10.090> trying<00:01:10.299> to<00:01:10.360> try<00:01:10.509> many

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:10.899 
along this is it the trying to try many

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:12.630 
along this is it the trying to try many
if<00:01:11.020> it's<00:01:11.140> on<00:01:11.229> a<00:01:11.259> tabletop<00:01:11.710> you<00:01:12.250> can<00:01:12.430> still

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
if it's on a tabletop you can still

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.420 
if it's on a tabletop you can still
swinging<00:01:12.970> on<00:01:13.149> a<00:01:13.180> tabletop<00:01:13.570> you<00:01:14.409> get<00:01:14.740> one<00:01:15.070> plane

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
swinging on a tabletop you get one plane

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.100 
swinging on a tabletop you get one plane
if<00:01:15.640> it<00:01:15.700> feel<00:01:15.880> getting<00:01:15.970> closer<00:01:16.390> so<00:01:16.720> this<00:01:16.930> is<00:01:17.049> the

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
if it feel getting closer so this is the

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.350 
if it feel getting closer so this is the
first<00:01:17.380> kind<00:01:17.619> of<00:01:17.710> preset<00:01:18.280> so<00:01:18.850> I'm<00:01:18.970> just<00:01:19.180> going

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:19.360 
first kind of preset so I'm just going

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.859 
first kind of preset so I'm just going
to<00:01:19.420> aim<00:01:19.960> this<00:01:20.229> back<00:01:20.500> at<00:01:20.649> the<00:01:20.680> lens<00:01:21.869> we've

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
to aim this back at the lens we've

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.649 
to aim this back at the lens we've
established<00:01:23.049> that<00:01:24.119> this<00:01:25.119> is<00:01:25.299> perfectly

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
established that this is perfectly

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:28.919 
established that this is perfectly
parallel<00:01:25.960> to<00:01:26.289> that<00:01:26.320> and<00:01:26.740> now<00:01:26.890> we<00:01:27.929> understand

00:01:28.919 --> 00:01:28.929 
parallel to that and now we understand

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:31.020 
parallel to that and now we understand
that<00:01:29.140> we<00:01:29.380> focus<00:01:29.860> the<00:01:29.890> autofocus<00:01:30.610> system<00:01:30.729> is

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
that we focus the autofocus system is

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.370 
that we focus the autofocus system is
pointedly<00:01:31.390> right<00:01:32.020> here

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
pointedly right here

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.560 
pointedly right here
and<00:01:32.740> that's<00:01:32.920> the<00:01:33.070> only<00:01:33.189> limit<00:01:33.549> sees<00:01:33.820> now<00:01:34.509> we

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
and that's the only limit sees now we

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.179 
and that's the only limit sees now we
want<00:01:34.960> to<00:01:35.020> make<00:01:35.110> sure<00:01:35.380> that<00:01:35.590> it<00:01:35.710> doesn't<00:01:35.890> see

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:36.189 
want to make sure that it doesn't see

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:38.309 
want to make sure that it doesn't see
this<00:01:36.369> back<00:01:36.610> playing<00:01:37.030> back<00:01:37.330> here<00:01:37.659> so<00:01:37.899> we<00:01:37.929> close

00:01:38.309 --> 00:01:38.319 
this back playing back here so we close

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:40.740 
this back playing back here so we close
this<00:01:38.590> shutter<00:01:38.920> so<00:01:39.580> now<00:01:39.759> that's<00:01:40.240> brought<00:01:40.509> this

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
this shutter so now that's brought this

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.020 
this shutter so now that's brought this
whole<00:01:40.990> okay<00:01:41.799> so<00:01:42.220> we're<00:01:42.340> going<00:01:42.429> to<00:01:42.490> focus<00:01:42.700> on

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
whole okay so we're going to focus on

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.820 
whole okay so we're going to focus on
this<00:01:43.209> and<00:01:43.420> when<00:01:43.569> the<00:01:43.659> autofocus<00:01:44.049> focus<00:01:44.560> is<00:01:44.679> on

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
this and when the autofocus focus is on

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.160 
this and when the autofocus focus is on
this<00:01:44.950> it's<00:01:45.220> working<00:01:45.549> properly<00:01:45.789> it<00:01:46.600> creates<00:01:47.049> a

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
this it's working properly it creates a

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.870 
this it's working properly it creates a
plan<00:01:47.500> of<00:01:47.679> focus<00:01:48.130> that<00:01:48.310> if<00:01:48.429> stone<00:01:48.700> is

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
plan of focus that if stone is

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.090 
plan of focus that if stone is
infinitely<00:01:49.539> so<00:01:50.080> we<00:01:50.170> have<00:01:50.289> an<00:01:50.380> infinite<00:01:50.740> plane

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
infinitely so we have an infinite plane

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.520 
infinitely so we have an infinite plane
of<00:01:51.250> focus<00:01:51.429> we're<00:01:52.149> going<00:01:52.299> to<00:01:52.360> take<00:01:52.539> this<00:01:52.780> depth

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
of focus we're going to take this depth

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.199 
of focus we're going to take this depth
of<00:01:53.709> field<00:01:53.950> display<00:01:54.429> device<00:01:54.759> which<00:01:55.030> we<00:01:55.179> call

00:01:55.199 --> 00:01:55.209 
of field display device which we call

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:57.690 
of field display device which we call
the<00:01:55.539> ruler<00:01:55.899> and<00:01:56.350> take<00:01:56.649> the<00:01:56.830> zero<00:01:57.130> ball<00:01:57.429> and

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
the ruler and take the zero ball and

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.090 
the ruler and take the zero ball and
intercept<00:01:58.479> that<00:01:58.689> plane<00:01:58.959> of<00:01:58.990> focus<00:01:59.289> and

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
intercept that plane of focus and

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.429 
intercept that plane of focus and
intercept<00:02:00.880> that<00:02:01.030> letter<00:02:01.209> to<00:02:01.420> focus<00:02:01.840> and<00:02:02.049> then

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439 
intercept that letter to focus and then

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:04.380 
intercept that letter to focus and then
for<00:02:02.709> convenience<00:02:03.250> we're<00:02:03.459> going<00:02:03.640> to<00:02:03.729> tilt<00:02:04.240> it

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
for convenience we're going to tilt it

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.940 
for convenience we're going to tilt it
up<00:02:04.509> so<00:02:04.659> we<00:02:04.780> can<00:02:04.840> see<00:02:05.170> it<00:02:05.319> but<00:02:05.500> the<00:02:05.590> point<00:02:05.860> being

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
up so we can see it but the point being

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.400 
up so we can see it but the point being
whether<00:02:06.369> the<00:02:06.580> ruler<00:02:06.789> was<00:02:07.030> like<00:02:07.240> this<00:02:07.479> or<00:02:08.140> this

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
whether the ruler was like this or this

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.050 
whether the ruler was like this or this
the<00:02:08.679> zero<00:02:08.920> long<00:02:09.160> is<00:02:09.340> always<00:02:09.579> going<00:02:09.759> to<00:02:09.820> be<00:02:09.880> in

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
the zero long is always going to be in

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:16.399 
the zero long is always going to be in
focus

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:19.080 

basically<00:02:17.409> we<00:02:17.650> just<00:02:17.680> take<00:02:18.010> a<00:02:18.040> picture<00:02:18.280> okay

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
basically we just take a picture okay

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.660 
basically we just take a picture okay
mirror<00:02:19.720> mirror<00:02:20.019> lock-up<00:02:20.409> cells<00:02:20.980> timer<00:02:21.280> so<00:02:21.640> I

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
mirror mirror lock-up cells timer so I

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.899 
mirror mirror lock-up cells timer so I
don't<00:02:21.970> introduce<00:02:22.330> any<00:02:22.750> other<00:02:23.519> time<00:02:24.519> sharp

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:24.909 
don't introduce any other time sharp

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:39.350 
don't introduce any other time sharp
things<00:02:25.870> in<00:02:26.200> here<00:02:26.400> so<00:02:27.400> as<00:02:27.849> your<00:02:28.090> mom

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.710 

a<00:02:39.450> native<00:02:40.200> performance<00:02:40.490> was<00:02:41.490> this

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
a native performance was this

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.810 
a native performance was this
and<00:02:43.650> this<00:02:43.920> by<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.160> way<00:02:44.310> I've<00:02:44.430> just<00:02:44.460> put<00:02:44.760> the

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
and this by the way I've just put the
