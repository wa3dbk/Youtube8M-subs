00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
races and södra Moria would be cold but

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.490 
races and södra Moria would be cold but
i<00:00:17.369> would<00:00:17.670> recommend<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.600> mine<00:00:18.900> dragon<00:00:19.470> and

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:21.500 
i would recommend the mine dragon and

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.060 
i would recommend the mine dragon and
yeah<00:00:22.500> we<00:00:22.680> should<00:00:22.859> kick<00:00:23.490> it<00:00:23.670> off<00:00:23.820> here<00:00:24.980> if<00:00:25.980> you

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
yeah we should kick it off here if you

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.210 
yeah we should kick it off here if you
never<00:00:26.250> played<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.670> racetrack<00:00:27.090> before<00:00:27.449> you

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
never played the racetrack before you

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:34.880 
never played the racetrack before you
probably<00:00:29.220> will<00:00:31.309> yeah<00:00:32.309> you<00:00:32.669> need<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:33.230> tap<00:00:34.230> the

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
probably will yeah you need to tap the

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.040 
probably will yeah you need to tap the
screen<00:00:35.010> just<00:00:35.399> as<00:00:35.820> they<00:00:36.000> go<00:00:36.149> over<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.480> line<00:00:36.660> as

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
screen just as they go over the line as

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.260 
screen just as they go over the line as
you<00:00:37.950> can<00:00:38.100> see<00:00:38.250> there's<00:00:38.460> different<00:00:38.790> habitats

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
you can see there's different habitats

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.290 
you can see there's different habitats
this<00:00:39.510> one<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:39.840> suited<00:00:40.200> for<00:00:40.410> both<00:00:40.969> and<00:00:41.969> all<00:00:42.180> of

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
this one is suited for both and all of

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.540 
this one is suited for both and all of
them<00:00:42.450> so<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.410> makes<00:00:43.739> really<00:00:44.100> good<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.489> you

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
them so it makes really good and you

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.430 
them so it makes really good and you
most<00:00:45.000> likely<00:00:45.210> come<00:00:45.480> first<00:00:45.719> like<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.170> just<00:00:46.200> did

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
most likely come first like I just did

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.630 
most likely come first like I just did
there<00:00:48.260> I'm<00:00:49.260> just<00:00:49.469> going<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.739> skip<00:00:50.190> all<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.370> this

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
there I'm just going to skip all of this

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.819 
there I'm just going to skip all of this
I<00:00:50.969> can't<00:00:51.960> really<00:00:52.170> skip<00:00:52.440> this<00:00:52.760> yeah<00:00:54.829> sometimes

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
I can't really skip this yeah sometimes

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.260 
I can't really skip this yeah sometimes
when<00:00:56.010> you've<00:00:56.129> got<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.399> gold<00:00:56.610> oil<00:00:56.789> you'll<00:00:57.120> get

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
when you've got the gold oil you'll get

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.590 
when you've got the gold oil you'll get
jams<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.899> stuff<00:00:58.079> like<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.230> but<00:00:59.570> what<00:01:00.570> I

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
jams and stuff like that but what I

jams and stuff like that but what I
don't<00:01:01.140> want<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.530> food<00:01:01.770> because<00:01:02.219> I've<00:01:02.340> got

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.789 
don't want is food because I've got
absolutely<00:01:02.579> tons<00:01:03.739> in<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.860> corner<00:01:05.159> there<00:01:05.280> and

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
absolutely tons in the corner there and

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:15.320 
absolutely tons in the corner there and
rhyme<00:01:07.799> or<00:01:08.040> reason<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.729> in<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.630> cold<00:01:14.210> yeah<00:01:15.210> i'm

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
rhyme or reason is in the cold yeah i'm

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:27.180 
rhyme or reason is in the cold yeah i'm
just<00:01:15.420> going<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.750> do<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.930> cold<00:01:16.830> dragon

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.210 

yeah<00:01:28.090> cold<00:01:28.450> air<00:01:28.780> this<00:01:28.930> is<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.380> things<00:01:29.620> as<00:01:29.800> snow

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
yeah cold air this is the things as snow

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.990 
yeah cold air this is the things as snow
dragon<00:01:30.700> is<00:01:30.820> probably<00:01:31.120> the<00:01:31.240> best<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:33.490> select

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
dragon is probably the best to select

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.030 
dragon is probably the best to select
this<00:01:34.330> and<00:01:34.630> so<00:01:34.900> there's<00:01:35.290> no<00:01:35.440> driving<00:01:35.650> to<00:01:35.830> doing

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
this and so there's no driving to doing

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:47.020 
this and so there's no driving to doing
very<00:01:36.490> well

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.630 

you<00:01:47.600> can<00:01:47.810> soar<00:01:48.320> skip<00:01:48.680> this<00:01:48.830> by<00:01:49.070> about<00:01:49.250> 5

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
you can soar skip this by about 5

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:56.080 
you can soar skip this by about 5
seconds<00:01:50.060> 10<00:01:50.180> seconds<00:01:50.690> if<00:01:50.780> you<00:01:50.869> want<00:01:51.520> yeah<00:01:55.090> okay

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
seconds 10 seconds if you want yeah okay

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.390 
seconds 10 seconds if you want yeah okay
so<00:01:56.150> I've<00:01:56.270> got<00:01:56.420> 85,000<00:01:57.290> their<00:01:59.920> electric<00:02:00.920> skies

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
so I've got 85,000 their electric skies

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.969 
so I've got 85,000 their electric skies
is<00:02:02.060> probably<00:02:02.690> best<00:02:02.960> for<00:02:03.080> the<00:02:03.290> sonic<00:02:03.680> dragon

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
is probably best for the sonic dragon

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.600 
is probably best for the sonic dragon
which<00:02:06.979> is<00:02:07.130> just<00:02:07.460> here<00:02:08.380> because<00:02:09.380> of<00:02:09.739> it<00:02:10.220> is

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
which is just here because of it is

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.430 
which is just here because of it is
lightning<00:02:11.569> and<00:02:12.790> air<00:02:13.790> so<00:02:14.540> this<00:02:14.720> will<00:02:14.900> do<00:02:15.020> really

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
lightning and air so this will do really

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.630 
lightning and air so this will do really
well<00:02:15.590> in<00:02:15.830> this<00:02:16.130> race<00:02:17.110> you<00:02:18.110> can<00:02:18.590> get<00:02:18.830> a<00:02:18.860> hint<00:02:19.100> if
