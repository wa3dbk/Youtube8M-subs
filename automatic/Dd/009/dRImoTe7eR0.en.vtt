00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:08.400
 Welcome to another test of 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.119
 www handy.de you see that already 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.930
 what we test and although the lgb 

00:00:11.119 --> 00:00:18.930
 720 optimus 3d max or 3d max each 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.740
 after that it is in the second quarter of 2012 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.780
 appeared 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.030
 behind we have a few technical 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.950
 can see data and what can that do 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:29.610
 Above all , you can do it here 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:31.680
 see 3d here everything is 3d you have one 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.559
 genova 3d display 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.710
 you have a 3d camera so twice 5 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.469
 megapixel you can play 3d games 3d 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.409
 photos make 3d movies look and you 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.870
 You can even convert 2d to 3d 

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:47.940
 with an extra app as well the whole 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.179
 We'll see you work in progress 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.800
 the video test in more detail in the reason 

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:56.309
 we come to the end and that in the 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.149
 fifth part of multimedia shares we want 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.769
 now know what is happening on the 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.559
 packaging you can already see and 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:06.570
 this is the lg 3d max abbreviated here 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:09.960
 this is how the device looks from the outside 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:13.050
 we already see the double 5 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.240
 Megapixel camera with it's 3D photos 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.910
 could do that in the 3d effect 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.010
 basically based on that two 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.930
 pictures are placed on top of each other 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.240
 is it then two easy 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.190
 shifted pictures and yes your eyes 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.830
 put these pictures together again 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.500
 to a single picture and this picture 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.470
 is then shown in 3d to say so 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.450
 how well that works, I will 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.850
 show you in more detail but in the reason 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.730
 could that test now in this video 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.920
 do not perceive it that way because the whole thing 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.770
 yes only for me in 3d is not visible 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.720
 unfortunately for you what I already ahead 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.330
 It can be said that I am the first 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.840
 be a little bit more all day long 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:57.090
 have a little feeling of nausea and me 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.220
 guess that's only since then 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.690
 here have played a few games and 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.170
 the camera used and so on and so on 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.570
 immediately 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.180
 So a little bit takes one of these 3d 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:10.440
 effect already with yes first see something 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:13.230
 we here we have here 127 mm x 67 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.750
 millimeters x 10 millimeters 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.299
 thicket the device is already something 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.580
 wider as you can see very edgy 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:22.530
 seems a bit too clunky to me 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.310
 or I think it's a bit too chunky 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.200
 but depending on how you like it 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.849
 I mean there are some devices that 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.200
 Personally , I am so angular 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:36.450
 It's a little too big and too big for me 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.640
 a lot but that's a decision 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.110
 Witness very big display what do we have 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.060
 otherwise we have up here if we are 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.010
 look at an on and off switch 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.620
 or the sleep and away button 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.049
 to the left is a 3.5 millimeter socket 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.540
 for headphones on the right side 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:54.359
 you can only find the switch or 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:58.890
 fast start button for the camera or 3 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:03:01.319
 the camera will be there team so you see 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.470
 there is left we have the volume 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:06.930
 seesaw and bucket under this hood 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:11.010
 Input for the micro USB cable 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:13.019
 Below we have the microphone behind 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.359
 as we said, we find these double 5 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:18.720
 megapixel camera in front we have one 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:21.180
 front camera we can see and the 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.980
 take photos in vga we look 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.139
 once in the scope of delivery here once 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.269
 pull up the cardboard then we see 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:29.430
 here once the adapter for the 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:32.069
 socket so that the device can charge 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.940
 of course you need a usb 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.359
 electric wire 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.889
 we have usb to micro usb here 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:41.069
 you can load once with the adapter 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:42.030
 or at the computer so then we have here 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:45.840
 once 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.730
 the headphones with 3.5 mm jack and we 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.670
 have a battery here it acts 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:54.420
 a lithium ion 1500 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:56.340
 milli-hour battery according to lg is the 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.040
 four hours of talk time 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.319
 in standby mode up to 100 hours 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.860
 we still have something like that 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:04.080
 instructions so a junk 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:07.410
 you can read through everything 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:10.730
 uni gets her text and lg tags 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.959
 you can get it via nfc near field communication 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:16.590
 there can be read the comeau 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:18.239
 duss office mode and sleep mode like 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:22.350
 that's exactly what works in the fifth 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:24.930
 part in the multimedia video so the pack 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.950
 is empty otherwise and that was what I was 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.020
 to say about it 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.100
 I'll put the SIM card and 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.960
 the battery a 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.180
 in the back we have such a small one here 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.900
 slot can see here once 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.780
 collected 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:39.720
 then we have the battery cover here very much 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:42.240
 very soft is the concept that that 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.580
 does not break through then we have here 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:48.900
 now the inner ones, so to speak the 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:51.690
 camera again and here the input for 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:54.030
 a micro sd card as well here 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.970
 input for a normal sim card no 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:59.010
 Insert micro-sim once and then 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.620
 I use once the 1500 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:04.500
 mah battery and indeed 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:08.370
 Here are the contacts up 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:12.300
 zack and the battery cover on it again 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:17.160
 so put the whole thing over once 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:19.560
 a rest and now we can do that 

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.510
 immediately start up that one 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.180
 in the next part of the operation video still 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:26.550
 short to the memory we have an 8 here 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.620
 gb internal memory so here was 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:30.450
 already a bit taken care of it 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.640
 already some 3d games 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:34.680
 I also preinstalled you in the 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.870
 fifth part in the multimedia video once 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.850
 want to show so there you have already 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.890
 some ab work with on this device 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:42.780
 that's why eight gigabytes is already 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:44.820
 you can do it all, of course 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:48.900
 Expand as I showed him by 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:52.050
 Micro SD card up to 32 GB with battery 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.520
 the device now weighs 150 grams so that 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.780
 noted 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:55.669
 In any case, that's it 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:57.770
 a little bit more down here you see 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:59.930
 the whole thing is a bit thicker at the moment 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.879
 lower side and besides that costs 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:06.259
 Depending on where you look between 

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:09.919
 290 and 310 euros more details 

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:12.729
