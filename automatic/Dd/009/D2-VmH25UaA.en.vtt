00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:14.750
 That's what you think is the start and welcome 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:19.820
 show a small round 32 times like b4 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:21.440
 on the nvidia geforce gtx 650 on ultra 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.900
 I can show those that I run 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:30.470
 he crashed everything on ultra 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:33.250
 and yes, but it is also under chamber 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:38.960
 not play with the gcx 650 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:41.089
 I have to be exactly 26 fps at the moment 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:45.589
 record if I'm not on it 

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:47.749
 so 30 to 40 well anyway that's how it looks 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:53.469
 also immediately or at the gtx 650 though 

00:00:47.749 --> 00:00:58.460
 it also receives is actually so 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:01:01.699
 and now I'm going to medium so 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.699
 here medium and now has seen that 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:06.630
 maybe a bit different though 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:11.170
 I still have a little bit 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:17.289
 we breed something that way this is going on 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:20.549
 if you play here at the most medium 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:20.549
 get high on everyone again 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.460
 I can do it again 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.340
 I do not know how much without me 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.020
 take up 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.960
 and now we have to praise and 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.310
 then we'll see what kind of graphics 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:41.799
 which like maybe we just then 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:45.039
 we have to play as the game changes 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:55.929
 weapon for example very much and we have 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:56.470
 as much as 50 mps on each 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:01.539
 case 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:03.310
 I think I stay with the medium because 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:05.369
 that is also clear with the fork 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.369
 or 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:10.050
 Yes 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.930
 bookable 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.930
 every case in the video
