travel sense this is not really
practical<00:00:40.450> because<00:00:41.020> these<00:00:41.440> drawers<00:00:41.770> will

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
practical because these drawers will

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:43.440

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
but when I first saw this at Sephora

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.760 
but when I first saw this at Sephora
that's<00:01:34.420> where<00:01:34.600> this<00:01:34.720> is<00:01:34.869> exclusively<00:01:35.470> being

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
that's where this is exclusively being

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.030 
that's where this is exclusively being
sold<00:01:36.070> I<00:01:36.990> noticed<00:01:37.990> that<00:01:38.080> they<00:01:38.409> weren't<00:01:38.710> the

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
sold I noticed that they weren't the

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.270 
sold I noticed that they weren't the
typical<00:01:39.670> like<00:01:40.150> tart<00:01:40.720> eyeshadow<00:01:41.350> look<00:01:41.830> that

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
typical like tart eyeshadow look that

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.100 
typical like tart eyeshadow look that
most<00:01:42.610> of<00:01:42.760> the<00:01:42.850> other<00:01:42.970> tart<00:01:43.299> palettes<00:01:43.689> have<00:01:43.900> you

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
most of the other tart palettes have you

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.480 
most of the other tart palettes have you
know<00:01:44.229> where<00:01:44.380> their<00:01:44.500> little<00:01:44.740> squares<00:01:45.100> and<00:01:45.400> I

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
know where their little squares and I

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.490 
know where their little squares and I
say<00:01:45.700> tart<00:01:46.060> in<00:01:46.240> the<00:01:46.360> center<00:01:46.689> and<00:01:46.810> so<00:01:47.350> that

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
say tart in the center and so that

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.140 
say tart in the center and so that
instantly<00:01:47.950> made<00:01:48.159> me<00:01:48.340> think<00:01:48.610> maybe<00:01:48.820> these<00:01:49.090> are

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
instantly made me think maybe these are

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.510 
instantly made me think maybe these are
a<00:01:49.509> different<00:01:49.900> formulation<00:01:50.500> or<00:01:50.830> not<00:01:51.040> as<00:01:51.220> good

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
a different formulation or not as good

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.070 
a different formulation or not as good
of<00:01:51.549> a<00:01:51.759> formulation<00:01:52.270> as<00:01:52.600> most<00:01:52.840> of<00:01:52.960> their

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
of a formulation as most of their

families so if you often get palettes

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.150 
families so if you often get palettes
and<00:04:19.419> wonder<00:04:19.780> how<00:04:20.019> do<00:04:20.080> I<00:04:20.200> use<00:04:20.290> that<00:04:20.680> or<00:04:20.799> how<00:04:21.010> do<00:04:21.070> I

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
and wonder how do I use that or how do I

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.400 
and wonder how do I use that or how do I
put<00:04:21.400> together<00:04:21.519> the<00:04:21.880> color<00:04:22.090> combinations<00:04:22.930> the

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
put together the color combinations the

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.350 
put together the color combinations the
fact<00:04:23.650> that<00:04:23.770> they<00:04:23.919> are<00:04:23.950> divided<00:04:24.760> like<00:04:24.940> they<00:04:25.150> are

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
fact that they are divided like they are

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.750 
fact that they are divided like they are
I<00:04:25.390> think<00:04:25.690> allows<00:04:26.229> you<00:04:26.620> to<00:04:26.950> have<00:04:27.250> some

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
I think allows you to have some

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.850 
I think allows you to have some
action<00:04:28.120> and<00:04:28.330> have<00:04:28.990> a<00:04:29.020> sense<00:04:29.290> of<00:04:29.470> kind<00:04:29.740> of

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
action and have a sense of kind of

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.020 
action and have a sense of kind of
what's<00:04:30.070> going<00:04:30.280> on<00:04:30.490> here<00:04:30.730> but<00:04:30.760> you<00:04:31.000> can

what's going on here but you can
definitely<00:04:31.360> you<00:04:31.900> know<00:04:32.020> mix<00:04:32.290> and<00:04:32.500> match<00:04:32.650> you've

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
definitely you know mix and match you've

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.190 
definitely you know mix and match you've
got<00:04:33.040> a<00:04:33.250> couple<00:04:33.550> of<00:04:33.730> I<00:04:33.910> products<00:04:34.540> here<00:04:34.780> one<00:04:35.020> is

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
got a couple of I products here one is

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.660 
got a couple of I products here one is
the<00:04:35.410> multiply<00:04:36.100> this<00:04:36.670> is<00:04:37.180> a<00:04:37.510> white<00:04:38.670> formula

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:39.670 
the multiply this is a white formula

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.190 
the multiply this is a white formula
here<00:04:39.940> that<00:04:40.090> you<00:04:40.180> will<00:04:40.300> put<00:04:40.510> on<00:04:40.540> your<00:04:40.930> lashes

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
before you put on masks I think it

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.210 
before you put on masks I think it
provides<00:04:43.600> great<00:04:44.200> length<00:04:44.560> and<00:04:44.860> I<00:04:44.920> could<00:04:45.070> see

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
provides great length and I could see

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.070 
provides great length and I could see
this<00:04:45.310> being<00:04:45.400> a<00:04:45.850> neat<00:04:46.150> little<00:04:46.300> thing<00:04:46.450> to<00:04:46.810> use

board<00:06:46.090> I<00:06:46.210> have<00:06:46.389> a<00:06:46.419> feeling<00:06:46.990> that<00:06:47.020> if<00:06:47.229> you

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:47.410 
board I have a feeling that if you

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:50.129 
board I have a feeling that if you
wanted<00:06:47.680> too<00:06:47.860> deep<00:06:48.580> on<00:06:48.849> these<00:06:49.150> so<00:06:49.449> to<00:06:49.509> speak<00:06:49.870> you

00:06:50.129 --> 00:06:50.139 
wanted too deep on these so to speak you

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:52.290 
wanted too deep on these so to speak you
can<00:06:50.289> see<00:06:50.530> they're<00:06:50.740> just<00:06:50.770> metal<00:06:51.460> backed<00:06:52.000> on

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:52.300 
can see they're just metal backed on

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.379 
can see they're just metal backed on
there<00:06:52.629> they<00:06:53.199> are<00:06:53.250> apparently<00:06:54.250> glued<00:06:54.639> in<00:06:54.970> so

00:06:55.379 --> 00:06:55.389 
there they are apparently glued in so

00:06:55.389 --> 00:06:56.879 
there they are apparently glued in so
maybe<00:06:55.599> you<00:06:55.720> could<00:06:55.870> pry<00:06:56.110> those<00:06:56.349> out<00:06:56.620> if<00:06:56.770> you

00:06:56.879 --> 00:06:56.889 
maybe you could pry those out if you

00:06:56.889 --> 00:06:58.469 
maybe you could pry those out if you
wanted<00:06:57.159> to<00:06:57.280> put<00:06:57.430> them<00:06:57.550> in<00:06:57.669> your<00:06:57.699> Z<00:06:58.000> palette<00:06:58.210> or

00:06:58.469 --> 00:06:58.479

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:01.070 
wanted to put them in your Z palette or
