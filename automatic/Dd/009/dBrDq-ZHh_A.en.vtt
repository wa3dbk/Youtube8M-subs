00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
obvious right from the first points that

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.189 
obvious right from the first points that
they<00:00:29.849> take<00:00:30.119> that<00:00:30.420> that's<00:00:30.689> what<00:00:30.929> they're<00:00:31.050> going

to<00:00:43.440> take<00:00:43.649> points<00:00:44.190> in<00:00:45.230> those<00:00:46.230> cases<00:00:46.829> as<00:00:47.730> soon<00:00:48.660> as

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
to take points in those cases as soon as

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.439 
to take points in those cases as soon as
you<00:00:49.320> recognize<00:00:49.620> that<00:00:50.280> someone<00:00:51.030> is<00:00:51.149> shooting

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
you recognize that someone is shooting

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.779 
you recognize that someone is shooting
the<00:00:51.570> moon<00:00:51.949> you<00:00:52.949> need<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:54.090> start<00:00:55.370> throwing<00:00:56.370> low

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
the moon you need to start throwing low

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.010 
the moon you need to start throwing low
cards<00:00:57.300> if<00:00:57.510> you<00:00:58.469> can't<00:00:58.829> win<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.250> trick<00:00:59.609> or<00:01:00.020> go

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
cards if you can't win a trick or go

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.560 
cards if you can't win a trick or go
ahead<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.379> jump<00:01:01.680> on<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.859> trick<00:01:02.190> if<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.460> can<00:01:02.969> win

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.250 
ahead and jump on a trick if you can win
it<00:01:03.719> so<00:01:04.339> let's<00:01:05.339> say<00:01:05.610> that<00:01:05.640> my<00:01:06.000> hand<00:01:06.479> included

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
it so let's say that my hand included

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.330 
it so let's say that my hand included
these<00:01:07.470> cards<00:01:08.270> okay<00:01:10.130> since<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:11.250> have<00:01:11.490> an<00:01:11.610> ace<00:01:12.320> if

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
these cards okay since I have an ace if

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:20.240 
these cards okay since I have an ace if
someone<00:01:14.780> throws<00:01:15.780> out<00:01:16.049> diamonds<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:19.040> it's<00:01:20.040> the

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
someone throws out diamonds and it's the

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.520 
someone throws out diamonds and it's the
person<00:01:20.580> who<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:20.790> shooting<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.180> moon<00:01:21.530> I'm

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
person who is shooting the moon I'm

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.450 
person who is shooting the moon I'm
gonna<00:01:22.740> throw<00:01:22.950> this<00:01:23.100> ace<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:24.500> hope<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:26.100> a
