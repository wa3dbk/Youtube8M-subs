00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:13.370
 haiangriffe for tablet blog.de I am 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:13.969
 still with asus on the ces in las 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.400
 Vegas 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:20.240
 we have the asus transformer book 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.660
 duett t300 that presented here now 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.520
 has been 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.310
 and this is a 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:29.060
 notebook or ultrabook on the both 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:31.550
 android as well as windows 8.1 we are running 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.430
 have android just to watch here and 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.530
 you can then mails the operating system 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.070
 There was an extra here 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.770
 for this 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.940
 and so ever says one device 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:45.810
 a little closer 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:49.350
 So we've got one here 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:55.140
 13 3 inch large display with a 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:57.660
 resolution of 1366 x 768 pixels is so 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.460
 not the biggest highest resolution the 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.910
 possible but the resolution is yet 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.140
 By the way, these apps are by the way 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.280
 the ordinary grad a bit 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.560
 gone around 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.370
 the perspectives are pretty 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.000
 Well 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:17.190
 there's an intel core i3 in here 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.630
 i5 or i7 processor rami after what 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.450
 you want to have that is the hate 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.820
 generation so the latest thing intel 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.580
 There are four at the moment 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.100
 gigabytes of memory and then 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.360
 different ssd option of 64 gigabytes 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:36.570
 over 128 gb and in the dock you can 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.250
 another 320 500 750 or one 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.650
 terabyte big hard drive 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.790
 bradls is a real hard drive and 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.550
 no ssd 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.930
 So you have a nice one 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.420
 memory extension with the keyboard 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.850
 dock your well we just go 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.460
 let's get closer to the device around here 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.390
 the said 13 3 inch display 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:00.179
 then we have a webcam up here 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:02.399
 because with one side look so one 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:03.810
 we do not see anything below 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.750
 we have a number of connections 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.640
 this is the windows button then here 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.530
 the connections for the docking stations 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.450
 but also for the power supply 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.640
 and there is also a headset 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:20.380
 connection then we have here 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.290
 nothing is here right now 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.030
 a push but they probably have nothing 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.780
 it may be possible to mean right now 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:31.510
 not yet a prototype 48 whose fan 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.430
 Czech of course we have a core 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.730
 processor in it and accordingly 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.470
 had to be cooled as well 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:42.670
 Well these are the connections we will then 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:45.250
 no usb have no usb connection here 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.530
 but then we have in the dock here with 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.900
 the usb 3.0 connection in addition to normal 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.870
 audio or 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:55.709
 headset connection and on this page 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.959
 we still have my power 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:01.450
 connect to the power supply and then one 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.220
 ethernet-port that it is very nice usb 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.080
 3.0 and a hdmi output 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:11.140
 I suspect that you have your side only 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:14.340
 usb 2.0 and here then usb 3.0 below 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:18.370
 we have not gummed anything 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:20.650
 Feet must not slip away and then 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.049
 Here we have a classic chiclet 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.110
 keyboard that with the other 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:28.959
 devices from asus such as the 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:31.690
 current ultrabooks series the trackpad 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:34.239
 is also very similar and makes 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.579
 a good impression of the bip graz and 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.799
 a bit with the dog on me will be 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:40.439
 in final versions then not the 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:43.299
 be a case 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:45.519
 In any case, the tablet makes you 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:47.950
 of course, here is here in and out 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:50.170
 then you can do it like a notebook like that 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.799
 fold over and place it anywhere 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:56.739
 windows 8.1 and changed to change 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:59.319
 any case an interesting solution 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:01.299
 that in everyday life everything is so important 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:04.180
 that a bit questionable at a 13 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:06.909
 3 inches, I would probably gets the 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.439
 Cruises he came with the windows 8 and 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:10.870
 do not want to work with android though 

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:12.819
 Maybe you have certain 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.680
 where it then quite useful 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:16.539
 i'm good at jeff her tablet 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.940
 blog.de this is a fast hanson with 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:22.349
 the asus transformer book duet t300 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.349
 Thanks for seeing
