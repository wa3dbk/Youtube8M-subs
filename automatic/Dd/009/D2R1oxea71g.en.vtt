00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
okay so 1961 panhead we just got it in

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.499 
okay so 1961 panhead we just got it in
it's<00:00:04.410> a<00:00:04.560> really<00:00:05.009> cool<00:00:05.220> bike<00:00:05.490> this<00:00:05.730> is<00:00:05.910> a<00:00:05.940> VL

stuffed<00:00:11.250> in<00:00:11.429> it<00:00:11.610> now<00:00:12.090> most<00:00:12.360> of<00:00:12.540> ice<00:00:12.719> that<00:00:12.870> were

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
stuffed in it now most of ice that were

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.589 
stuffed in it now most of ice that were
done<00:00:13.200> back<00:00:13.380> in<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.620> day<00:00:13.920> people<00:00:14.599> put

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
done back in the day people put

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.090 
done back in the day people put
knuckleheads<00:00:16.289> in<00:00:16.440> them<00:00:16.560> a<00:00:16.680> little<00:00:16.980> bit<00:00:17.070> easier

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
knuckleheads in them a little bit easier

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.519 
knuckleheads in them a little bit easier
and<00:00:17.640> it's<00:00:18.119> taller<00:00:18.510> machine<00:00:18.960> so<00:00:19.170> you've<00:00:19.320> really

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
and it's taller machine so you've really

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.220 
and it's taller machine so you've really
got<00:00:19.770> to<00:00:19.890> curve<00:00:20.130> this<00:00:20.369> whole<00:00:20.910> backbone<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:22.199> make

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
got to curve this whole backbone to make

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.929 
got to curve this whole backbone to make
it<00:00:22.500> work<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:22.980> this<00:00:23.100> guy<00:00:23.250> did<00:00:23.460> an<00:00:23.550> excellent

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
it work and this guy did an excellent

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:24.529 
it work and this guy did an excellent
job

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
job

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.500 
job
it<00:00:24.900> almost<00:00:25.109> looks<00:00:25.470> factory<00:00:26.210> the<00:00:27.210> whole<00:00:27.359> thing

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
it almost looks factory the whole thing

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.419 
it almost looks factory the whole thing
has<00:00:27.599> got<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.750> be<00:00:27.900> raised<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:29.039> just<00:00:29.250> does<00:00:29.400> not

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
has got to be raised it just does not

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.709 
has got to be raised it just does not
fit<00:00:29.929> and<00:00:30.929> you<00:00:31.050> put<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.560> four-speed<00:00:32.009> in<00:00:32.040> it<00:00:32.369> and

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:32.719 
fit and you put the four-speed in it and

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:34.790 
fit and you put the four-speed in it and
you<00:00:33.719> can<00:00:33.840> see<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.079> angle<00:00:34.290> of<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.410> training<00:00:34.770> I

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
you can see the angle of the training I

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.250 
you can see the angle of the training I
mean<00:00:34.950> it<00:00:35.070> just<00:00:35.340> does<00:00:35.550> not<00:00:35.730> fit<00:00:36.420> stupid<00:00:37.110> easy

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
mean it just does not fit stupid easy

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.490 
mean it just does not fit stupid easy
it's<00:00:37.800> a<00:00:37.890> trick<00:00:38.420> so<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.540> very<00:00:39.750> nicely<00:00:39.960> done<00:00:40.290> it's

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
it's a trick so it very nicely done it's

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.950 
it's a trick so it very nicely done it's
got<00:00:40.590> some<00:00:40.770> real<00:00:41.040> Springer<00:00:41.460> on<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:41.790> so<00:00:42.540> we<00:00:42.750> fired

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
got some real Springer on it so we fired

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.630 
got some real Springer on it so we fired
it<00:00:43.140> up<00:00:43.200> I<00:00:43.350> haven't<00:00:43.590> really<00:00:43.800> written<00:00:44.280> it<00:00:44.460> yet

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
it up I haven't really written it yet

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.810 
it up I haven't really written it yet
it's<00:00:45.539> got<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.719> pro<00:00:45.960> one<00:00:46.200> clutch<00:00:46.469> in<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.800> so<00:00:47.730> he

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
it's got a pro one clutch in it so he

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.950 
it's got a pro one clutch in it so he
tells<00:00:48.000> me<00:00:48.149> it's<00:00:48.270> matching<00:00:48.570> numbers<00:00:48.870> the

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
tells me it's matching numbers the

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.990 
tells me it's matching numbers the
tickler<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:49.410> go<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.860> check<00:00:50.129> that<00:00:50.309> out<00:00:50.370> yet<00:00:50.700> I'm

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
tickler is go and check that out yet I'm

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.220 
tickler is go and check that out yet I'm
going<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.210> check<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.420> floorboards<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.930> see<00:00:52.140> if

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
going to check the floorboards to see if

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.920 
going to check the floorboards to see if
the<00:00:52.320> wheel<00:00:52.500> they<00:00:52.680> probably<00:00:52.920> are<00:00:53.360> so<00:00:54.360> we're

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
the wheel they probably are so we're

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.510 
the wheel they probably are so we're
going<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.199> sell<00:00:55.469> it<00:00:55.620> or<00:00:56.610> write<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:57.469> so<00:00:58.520> somebody

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
going to sell it or write it so somebody

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.520 
going to sell it or write it so somebody
pays<00:00:59.699> me<00:00:59.879> the<00:00:59.910> money<00:01:00.149> I<00:01:00.210> want<00:01:00.480> it's<00:01:01.170> all<00:01:01.320> then

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
pays me the money I want it's all then

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.460 
pays me the money I want it's all then
until<00:01:02.160> I<00:01:02.219> get<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:02.809> I'm<00:01:03.809> rewriting<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:04.409> you

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
until I get that I'm rewriting it so you

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.530 
until I get that I'm rewriting it so you
might<00:01:04.619> see<00:01:04.799> me<00:01:04.949> with<00:01:05.250> this<00:01:05.820> bike<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.180> born<00:01:06.360> free

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
might see me with this bike it born free

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.750 
might see me with this bike it born free
we'll<00:01:06.720> see<00:01:06.900> because<00:01:07.140> it's<00:01:07.380> expensive<00:01:07.760> but

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
we'll see because it's expensive but

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.030 
we'll see because it's expensive but
it's<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.180> lot<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:10.200> work<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.680> build<00:01:10.830> this

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
it's a lot of work to build this

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.469 
it's a lot of work to build this
machine<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.580> parts<00:01:11.820> are<00:01:11.909> not<00:01:11.939> cheap<00:01:12.240> anymore

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
machine the parts are not cheap anymore

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.820 
machine the parts are not cheap anymore
than<00:01:12.780> IDs<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.170> find<00:01:13.409> anymore<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:14.420> I<00:01:15.830> the

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
than IDs and find anymore and I the

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.320 
than IDs and find anymore and I the
average<00:01:17.220> builder<00:01:17.549> could<00:01:17.670> not<00:01:17.850> build<00:01:18.090> it<00:01:18.240> for

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
average builder could not build it for

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.789 
average builder could not build it for
what<00:01:18.450> I'm<00:01:18.540> going<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.780> ask<00:01:18.930> for<00:01:19.080> this<00:01:19.200> machine<00:01:19.380> I

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
what I'm going to ask for this machine I

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.880 
what I'm going to ask for this machine I
could<00:01:20.159> know<00:01:20.460> before<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:21.810> anyhow<00:01:22.439> go

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
could know before that so anyhow go

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:23.719 
could know before that so anyhow go
ahead<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.130> swing<00:01:23.280> around

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
ahead and swing around

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.130 
ahead and swing around
I'm<00:01:24.119> good<00:01:24.330> look<00:01:24.509> so<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:24.900> get<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.140> good<00:01:25.200> look

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
I'm good look so I get a good look

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.690 
I'm good look so I get a good look
that<00:01:27.140> is<00:01:27.260> annex<00:01:27.560> a<00:01:27.680> seat<00:01:27.950> from<00:01:28.220> the<00:01:28.310> war<00:01:28.490> out

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
that is annex a seat from the war out

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.260 
that is annex a seat from the war out
that's<00:01:29.600> original<00:01:29.990> it's<00:01:30.110> nothing<00:01:30.350> real<00:01:30.500> toasty

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
that's original it's nothing real toasty

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.080 
that's original it's nothing real toasty
and<00:01:32.270> we<00:01:32.810> will<00:01:32.960> check<00:01:33.110> later<00:01:33.790> for<00:01:34.790> matching

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
and we will check later for matching

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.550 
and we will check later for matching
belt<00:01:35.240> numbers<00:01:37.900> we<00:01:38.900> do<00:01:39.020> have<00:01:39.170> original

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
belt numbers we do have original

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.740 
belt numbers we do have original
cylinders<00:01:40.010> original<00:01:40.460> heads<00:01:41.380> and<00:01:43.660> appears<00:01:44.660> to

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
cylinders original heads and appears to

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.980 
cylinders original heads and appears to
be<00:01:44.900> correct<00:01:45.200> 61<00:01:45.830> heads<00:01:48.430> you<00:01:49.430> have<00:01:49.580> to<00:01:49.729> actually

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
be correct 61 heads you have to actually

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.149 
be correct 61 heads you have to actually
pull<00:01:50.990> the<00:01:51.020> tins<00:01:51.470> off<00:01:51.710> to<00:01:51.860> see<00:01:51.979> what<00:01:52.009> the

pull the tins off to see what the

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:53.740 
pull the tins off to see what the
