00:00:01.239 --> 00:00:04.230
 it was enough of a small goal 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.880
 43rd minute vaugeois's free kick was touched by baysse 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.859
 then by the poles of beauvoir douchez is beaten 

00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:14.499
 this is not the goal of the year but it sends cubic in the quarterfinals of the 

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:17.499
 French Cup 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:20.970
 if the adventurer has increased 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.970
 quarterfinals the Canadian defense 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:31.669
 otherwise it's normal is the scenario we know 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:34.030
 in the left press 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.540
 perhaps 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.840
 this ubiquitous qualification shaping it on the blackboard without shaking 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.100
 or almost 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.570
 the equation was simple 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.830
 what a failure Rennes attack that had just scored four goals to the leader 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.870
 Bordeaux mission accomplished beyond the expectations for the Bretons there is good 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.110
 had a few small bits of opportunity 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.500
 but nothing very sharp 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.260
 but it's true we do not have these things on both occasions I pay tribute 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.400
 request for two good opportunities 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.400
 my client did not score a goal 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.890
 this seventh episode 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.189
 published by associated content 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.219
 with disconcerting insurance after leave club league 2 it's reindeer on 

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:18.710
 finalist of the last edition passing by the trap 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:19.840
 it's surprising 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.610
 but that's not illogical 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.400
 I think that the communes and that to take action 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.310
 since two years ago to play practically together 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.840
 in six new media 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.540
 we are not novices in the football we train every day 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.750
 in my head I also find as his dts as if we were at the controls 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.270
 elsewhere in the world we all have the same goal 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.180
 seven hundred and fifty minutes without taking a goal 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.770
 god are little affected it's perrault because this team is decidedly 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.690
 invincible the expo is huge and something tells me 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.250
 but it may not be over 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.500
 when I think I will continue to understand it like that vinals 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.410
 in her voice as we say at home a beautiful story that she is at the stadium 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:03.320
 French we take two goals and why not win the Coupe de France and 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.090
 now 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.420
 we will have to go back down to earth 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.269
 Saturday the team will return to the CFA championship for the match 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:10.819
 against racing
