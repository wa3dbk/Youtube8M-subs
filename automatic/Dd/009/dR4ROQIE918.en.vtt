and trying to charge this device by the
computer<00:01:35.579> it's<00:01:35.820> gonna<00:01:36.030> be<00:01:36.180> roughly<00:01:36.630> about<00:01:36.750> 3

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
computer it's gonna be roughly about 3

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.010 
computer it's gonna be roughly about 3
hours<00:01:37.829> or<00:01:38.070> so<00:01:38.220> if<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.850> charge<00:01:39.299> this<00:01:39.720> device

hours or so if you charge this device
via<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.710> Sun<00:01:40.920> it's<00:01:41.670> going<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.850> take<00:01:41.939> you

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
via the Sun it's going to take you

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.660 
via the Sun it's going to take you
probably<00:01:42.329> about<00:01:42.829> easily<00:01:43.829> between<00:01:44.369> five<00:01:44.640> and

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
probably about easily between five and

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.929 
probably about easily between five and
six<00:01:45.420> hours<00:01:45.950> so<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.040> can<00:01:47.130> see<00:01:47.280> i'ma<00:01:47.670> leave<00:01:47.790> it
