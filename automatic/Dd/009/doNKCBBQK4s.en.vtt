little bit but um to my surprise man it
actually<00:02:09.610> it<00:02:10.000> actually<00:02:10.320> it's<00:02:11.320> pretty<00:02:11.530> hard<00:02:11.830> as

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
actually it actually it's pretty hard as

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:48.450 
actually it actually it's pretty hard as
well<00:02:12.760> me<00:02:13.290> because<00:02:14.290> I'd<00:02:14.380> turn<00:02:14.530> it<00:02:14.650> on

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460
