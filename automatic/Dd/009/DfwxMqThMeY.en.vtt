00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
font and we were able to then move right

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.260 
font and we were able to then move right
into<00:01:54.540> rendering<00:01:55.079> actually<00:01:55.920> with<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.399> maxima

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
into rendering actually with the maxima

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.840 
into rendering actually with the maxima
system<00:01:57.659> we<00:01:57.780> were<00:01:57.840> able<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.110> use<00:01:58.409> 3d<00:01:59.219> studio<00:01:59.399> max

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
system we were able to use 3d studio max

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.209 
system we were able to use 3d studio max
we<00:02:00.570> were<00:02:00.659> able<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.899> use<00:02:01.079> Adobe<00:02:01.619> After<00:02:01.770> Effects

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
we were able to use Adobe After Effects

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.280 
we were able to use Adobe After Effects
simultaneously<00:02:03.180> so<00:02:03.479> while<00:02:03.659> i<00:02:03.689> was<00:02:04.020> showing

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
simultaneously so while i was showing

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.709 
simultaneously so while i was showing
them<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:05.100> changes<00:02:05.549> i<00:02:05.640> was<00:02:05.790> making<00:02:06.240> in<00:02:06.509> one

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
them the changes i was making in one

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.960 
them the changes i was making in one
application<00:02:06.899> i<00:02:07.619> was<00:02:07.950> already<00:02:08.340> starting<00:02:08.670> the

application i was already starting the

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:09.639 
application i was already starting the

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
render process

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.339

and<00:02:09.920> another<00:02:10.159> application<00:02:10.670> and<00:02:11.140> that<00:02:12.140> was

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
and another application and that was

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.229 
and another application and that was
really<00:02:12.620> the<00:02:12.769> only<00:02:12.890> way<00:02:13.340> the<00:02:13.549> job<00:02:13.760> was<00:02:13.939> going<00:02:14.120> to

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
really the only way the job was going to

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.300 
really the only way the job was going to
get<00:02:14.360> done<00:02:14.510> so<00:02:14.750> not<00:02:15.379> only<00:02:15.530> did<00:02:15.739> we<00:02:15.920> take<00:02:16.099> this

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
get done so not only did we take this

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.509 
get done so not only did we take this
challenge<00:02:16.870> and<00:02:17.870> we<00:02:18.170> went<00:02:18.349> from<00:02:18.560> possibly

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
challenge and we went from possibly

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:21.699 
challenge and we went from possibly
telling<00:02:19.909> a<00:02:20.000> client<00:02:20.209> no<00:02:20.659> on<00:02:20.959> something<00:02:21.590> that

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
telling a client no on something that

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.830 
telling a client no on something that
they<00:02:21.799> really<00:02:21.980> wanted<00:02:22.459> and<00:02:22.640> and<00:02:23.180> that<00:02:23.420> honestly

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
they really wanted and and that honestly

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.809 
they really wanted and and that honestly
was<00:02:24.049> going<00:02:24.260> to<00:02:24.379> make<00:02:24.500> the<00:02:24.590> show<00:02:24.769> better<00:02:25.099> we

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
was going to make the show better we

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.380 
was going to make the show better we
went<00:02:25.970> from<00:02:26.090> that<00:02:26.420> to<00:02:27.040> no<00:02:28.040> stress<00:02:28.430> running

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
went from that to no stress running

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.360 
went from that to no stress running
through<00:02:29.510> lots<00:02:29.720> of<00:02:29.900> options<00:02:30.079> Jeff<00:02:31.010> got<00:02:31.220> to

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
through lots of options Jeff got to

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.089 
through lots of options Jeff got to
sleep<00:02:31.700> which<00:02:32.569> was<00:02:32.810> a<00:02:32.840> first<00:02:33.079> for<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.470> show<00:02:33.680> all

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:34.099 
sleep which was a first for the show all

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.039 
sleep which was a first for the show all
because<00:02:34.640> the<00:02:34.760> maximum<00:02:35.150> system<00:02:35.450> was<00:02:35.870> there

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:36.049 
because the maximum system was there

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:37.929
