 we will show you step by step and so 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.450
 detailed how to paint and decorate easy and 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.019
 fast an interior wall with templates 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.019
 decorative 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.529
 to start your project you are going to 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:31.149
 need living decorative template 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:34.559
 designs paint foam roller 4 or 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:38.909
 6 inches and brushes for templates 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:43.860
 plastic tray blue adhesive tape 

00:00:38.909 --> 00:00:46.410
 be victuals and a ladder 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.930
 first you have to prepare the area in 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.550
 zintan the entire shore to prevent 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.070
 it gets stained during the process 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.500
 we will begin to paint from above towards 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.410
 below and for that we will use the 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.329
 roof template we place our 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:05.320
 roof template and the ideal is 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:08.050
 start painting from left to right 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.430
 now we empty some paint in 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:15.120
 our plastic tray 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:18.210
 this step is very important the success of 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:21.150
 this technique is to use little paint 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.060
 please pay close attention to this 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:28.520
 we passed our roller and we impregnated it 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:31.009
 with a little paint without saturating it 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.679
 to remove the excess we pass the 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:37.190
 Bituaya laser roller until the 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:39.950
 roller look almost dry 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:44.690
 now if we start to roll 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:47.120
 without pressing for the entire area 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:50.000
 we remove the roof template and 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.010
 we continue with the big template now 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.680
 we put the big template and 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:57.560
 we use these guides that help us 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.590
 precisely to follow the pattern of 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:04.490
 our design so that it looks uniform 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:08.869
 and give the wallpaper look we passed 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:11.500
 the roller we paint and continue towards 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.470
 down with the next block 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.320
 to paint the corners simply 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.780
 we doubled our template 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.970
 we insure it with blue tape and in the 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.640
 areas where the roller does not reach 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:28.060
 We use the special brush to 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:31.510
 templates without saturating the paint and 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.820
 removing the excess in a napkin what 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.270
 let's do it by making a soft tapping 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:39.190
 and painting from the outside in 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.530
 we keep painting until we finish in the 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.570
 floor and for those areas where the 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.830
 roller does not reach to paint we use 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.280
 our brush 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:51.050
 we continue painting the next block 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.660
 starting again from above towards 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:59.320
 down to finish with our partner 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:59.320
 At the end we removed the blue ribbon and ready 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.269
 Now that you've seen how easy it is to paint and 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:10.670
 decorating with templates starts your 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:13.159
