a brief explanation in here and then I'm

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.830 
a brief explanation in here and then I'm
gonna<00:00:41.100> draw<00:00:41.430> up<00:00:41.610> some<00:00:41.879> kind<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.120> diagram<00:00:42.629> and

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
gonna draw up some kind of diagram and

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.080 
gonna draw up some kind of diagram and
computer<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.559> commentate<00:00:44.550> over<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:44.910> to

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
computer and commentate over that to

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.170 
computer and commentate over that to
show<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.300> more<00:00:45.480> clearly<00:00:46.070> so<00:00:47.070> basically<00:00:47.460> the

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
show you more clearly so basically the

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.119 
show you more clearly so basically the
wiring<00:00:48.450> loom<00:00:48.620> comes<00:00:49.620> out<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.860> back<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.039> the

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
wiring loom comes out the back of the

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.209 
wiring loom comes out the back of the
dashboard<00:00:51.199> the<00:00:52.199> rest<00:00:52.379> of<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.620> wire<00:00:52.829> in<00:00:53.010> there

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
dashboard the rest of the wire in there

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.779 
dashboard the rest of the wire in there
a<00:00:53.480> little<00:00:54.480> bit<00:00:54.780> into<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.140> three<00:00:55.610> lit<00:00:56.610> into

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
a little bit into the three lit into

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.389 
a little bit into the three lit into
three<00:00:56.969> first<00:00:57.870> ones<00:00:58.109> go<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.920> front<00:00:59.190> lights

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
three first ones go to the front lights

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.899 
three first ones go to the front lights
through<00:01:00.079> behind<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.260> radiator<00:01:02.780> the<00:01:03.780> second

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
through behind the radiator the second

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.539 
through behind the radiator the second
goes<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.210> back<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.750> back<00:01:06.930> lights<00:01:07.549> and

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
goes to the back to the back lights and

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.539 
goes to the back to the back lights and
the<00:01:08.670> third<00:01:09.140> that's<00:01:10.140> wiring<00:01:10.650> goes<00:01:10.860> into<00:01:11.430> the

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
the third that's wiring goes into the

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.140 
the third that's wiring goes into the
engine<00:01:12.799> okay<00:01:13.799> so<00:01:13.860> now<00:01:14.280> I'm<00:01:14.610> going<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.820> put<00:01:15.000> up

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
engine okay so now I'm going to put up

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.820 
engine okay so now I'm going to put up
the<00:01:16.020> diagram<00:01:16.500> I<00:01:16.830> spoke<00:01:17.369> about<00:01:17.400> earlier<00:01:20.150> so

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
the diagram I spoke about earlier so

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.380 
the diagram I spoke about earlier so
firstly<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:23.009> course<00:01:23.070> I<00:01:23.369> said<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.790> goes<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.210> the

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
firstly of course I said it goes to the

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.780 
firstly of course I said it goes to the
front<00:01:24.600> lights<00:01:25.159> comes<00:01:26.159> out<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.400> back<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.700> the

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
front lights comes out the back of the

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.109 
front lights comes out the back of the
dashboard<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.689> I'm<00:01:27.869> not<00:01:28.020> entirely<00:01:28.320> sure<00:01:28.590> how

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
dashboard and I'm not entirely sure how

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.580 
dashboard and I'm not entirely sure how
but<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.270> believe<00:01:30.689> it<00:01:30.869> goes<00:01:31.049> through<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.350> wing

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
but I believe it goes through the wing

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.679 
but I believe it goes through the wing
to<00:01:32.250> one<00:01:32.549> set<00:01:32.790> of<00:01:32.880> lights<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.299> then<00:01:33.420> through

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
to one set of lights and then through

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.109 
to one set of lights and then through
the<00:01:33.780> back<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:34.079> radiator<00:01:34.579> to<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.610> other<00:01:35.850> side

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
the back of a radiator to the other side

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.289 
the back of a radiator to the other side
of<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.329> lights<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:37.579> secondly<00:01:38.579> of<00:01:38.670> course<00:01:38.880> it

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
of the lights and secondly of course it

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.539 
of the lights and secondly of course it
goes<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.630> engine<00:01:40.079> but<00:01:40.680> first<00:01:41.070> he<00:01:41.280> goes<00:01:41.400> to

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
goes to the engine but first he goes to

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.990 
goes to the engine but first he goes to
the<00:01:41.670> battery<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.450> then<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.810> starter<00:01:43.140> motor

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
the battery and then the starter motor

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.690 
the battery and then the starter motor
and<00:01:45.000> finally<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:46.049> back<00:01:46.290> lights<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:47.040> the

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
and finally the back lights and the

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.730 
and finally the back lights and the
wires<00:01:47.909> get<00:01:48.240> there<00:01:48.450> they<00:01:48.659> go<00:01:48.869> down<00:01:49.320> through<00:01:49.619> the

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
wires get there they go down through the

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.340 
wires get there they go down through the
chassis<00:01:50.420> because<00:01:51.420> it's<00:01:51.720> hollow<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.229> then

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
chassis because it's hollow and then

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.020 
chassis because it's hollow and then
they<00:01:52.470> go<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.950> back<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.430> then<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.670> comes<00:01:53.880> up

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
they go to the back and then it comes up

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.460 
they go to the back and then it comes up
for<00:01:54.240> that<00:01:54.360> hole<00:01:54.600> that<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:54.869> showed<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.170> in<00:01:55.380> the

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
for that hole that I showed you in the

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.330 
for that hole that I showed you in the
video

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.890 

so<00:02:01.340> hopefully<00:02:01.550> that<00:02:01.820> diagram<00:02:02.210> was<00:02:02.480> useful<00:02:02.870> for

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
so hopefully that diagram was useful for

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.290 
so hopefully that diagram was useful for
you<00:02:03.170> I'm<00:02:04.040> actually<00:02:04.220> building<00:02:04.610> this<00:02:04.880> before

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
you I'm actually building this before

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.770 
you I'm actually building this before
I've<00:02:05.990> actually<00:02:06.290> made<00:02:06.560> the<00:02:06.740> diagram<00:02:07.250> so

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
I've actually made the diagram so

explaining<00:02:25.340> the<00:02:25.550> stuff<00:02:25.730> mechanically<00:02:26.270> more<00:02:26.510> I
