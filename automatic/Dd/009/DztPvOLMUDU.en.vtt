00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:11.700
 hi everyone today I you 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.019
 presents the continuation of the video held so 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.630
 I will show you my very first 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.340
 try to make a padded effect on 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.590
 the nails so I did not find that 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.330
 perfect so I tried to improve his 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.590
 sweat capsule I will all you 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.260
 explain in this video 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.199
 so I first have to lay a base and a 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.060
 pretty dark blue over this 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.040
 last of color I put a top coat 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.610
 matt only for my watercolors 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.550
 hangs well so for the tutorial I 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.320
 used watercolor paint 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.059
 only white and black for 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.579
 brushes it's watercolor brushes 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.879
 also the largest brain degraded the 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:51.210
 smaller at retail so on a varnish 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.430
 well dry well matt we will come to draw 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.989
 the first traits so for this first 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.699
 tri I also made them in watercolor 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.829
 but there you can do as you 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.699
 want watercolor or acrylic that's 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.409
 this is not very important so 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:07.590
 so it's not very important if your 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.990
 and are not very regular at the level 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.060
 of the thickness of the line actually since 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.360
 it's just benchmarks we're going to come 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.180
 go over in the end so that's 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.310
 just benchmarks on the other hand try to 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.979
 to make a fairly wide grid does not 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.570
 no tiles too small otherwise it's me 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.659
 will not look pretty for this effect 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.880
 capital is so even if you have 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.390
 short nails try to make 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.140
 tiles not too small 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.810
 then I'll take the second 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.119
 brush the one that serves for gradients 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.710
 which is a little bigger so frozen 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.799
 loaded with watercolor paint 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.899
 well pigmented well french and i'm going 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.119
 come make the shadows with so you 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.170
 see that I put the black in the corner 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:54.090
 end - diamond on the side of my diamond 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.880
 so my brush you see well loaded 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.920
 I dive into the water and I stay that 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.500
 I leave them a little bit I do not go out 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.780
 not completely so with this brush a 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.770
 little bit rinsed a little bit and would 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.229
 but not completely 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.959
 I come is shot and pigments of genius 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.849
 just now to have it degraded and 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.340
 so we will always proceed from the same 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:16.650
 way on every diamond I'm going to ask 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.049
 but reims pigments is a little bit 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.030
 but not totally my brush and and 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:24.010
 shoot all that to degrade the color 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.780
 and so you see that every time he 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.319
 must also put amber always 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.180
 same side 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.700
 you choose the left or the right 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.550
 it does not matter, but you must always put 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.450
 shadows on the same side on each 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:39.769
 diamond on each square 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.000
 and so you continue like that 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.769
 acrylic and maybe easier to 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.959
 use I do not know if you want 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.180
 see how I had done my shadows and 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.890
 lights on my video alwyn I you 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.380
 would put a little annotation you 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.970
 can go see 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.820
 it was easier I think this 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.530
 technique then that's what it gives 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.140
 we are going to do exactly the same thing 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.710
 thing now with white so 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.420
 it's white watercolor paint 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:08.180
 which I will deposit again on 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.280
 the side and that I'm going to stretched for 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.690
 degrade by cons you see that 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.800
 the watercolor white obviously I 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.170
 did not have the same side 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:19.110
 you put the black right or left 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.670
 and white on the opposite side to black 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.860
 so then it's always the same 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.790
 technical I would like to explain not everything 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.910
 it's always the same 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:29.490
 on the other hand the watercolor loose I find 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.770
 is quite difficult to work in any 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.270
 case mine I have a lot of trouble for 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.370
 working it is not the same as 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.770
 color watercolor white is 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.220
 quite particular so for the white in 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:43.110
 anyway I think it's easier 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.440
 to use acrylic paint well 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.550
 diluted in any case me next time 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.490
 I will use acrylic instead 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.470
 watercolor to close my keys 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:53.730
 white light 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.100
 that's what I did too 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.410
 on the capsule you will see at the end of 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.090
 video so again I do not you 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.660
 not all go away it's always 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.420
 the same thing 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.820
 that's what we get at the end then 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.860
 completely optional step it's me 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.690
 who prefers to do like that I put a 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.160
 clear varnish especially my angle 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.720
 for good it's the watercolor mountains 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.730
 before reworking the acrylic 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.730
 so here I take paint 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.750
 black acrylic and a retail brush 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:25.770
 for criticism and so I'll do 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:28.170
 all and all the interstices actually 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:32.160
 all the features of my 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:33.720
 padding so I that's why 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.100
 the markers at the beginning are not very 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.670
 important if they are not hyper 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.880
 regular 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:41.600
 on the other hand I'm going to make a more 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:44.880
 thick at intersections of each stroke 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:46.590
 so in fact there I do a very normal 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:49.080
 look well the picture is at 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.530
 the intersection I crush a little bit my 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.510
 brush 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.580
 then I pick it up again is another 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:54.210
 intersection so I crush a little bit 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.280
 my brush 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.900
 it's actually used to do something 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.090
 more go to intersections it's 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:03.270
 really what will give also 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:06.240
 embossed to your effect padded to your 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.070
 deco so you do that especially the nail 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.200
 I also wanted to tell you that the 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.720
 brush that I'm using right now you 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.520
 can also use it for painting 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.860
 watercolor in this video I wanted 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.510
 show you the real paintbrushes 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.880
 brushes that normally used in 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:23.790
 watercolor but you're not really 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:26.190
 obliged to invest in brushes 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:27.780
 for watercolor too I think everything 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.210
 can be done with this brush there me 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:33.330
 for a long time I also used this 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:36.960
 bread this for watercolor so I'm 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:38.520
 finishing my traits that make 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.530
 a shade a little darker at 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:42.060
 intersections 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:45.270
 I will now take the painting 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:47.490
 white acrylic and a back thing so 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.800
 this is the easiest of the fastest 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.270
 the most fun to do I'm going soaked 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.400
 mondo thing in acrylic paint 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.470
 age and I'm just going to make a 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.240
 small dot on all intersections 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.740
 on all the black parts that we 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.590
 made 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:05.160
 so over the black actually 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:08.850
 must forget no rights and in fact we 

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:11.040
 uses her favorite top coat we shall 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:13.560
 ask especially the angle for this decoration there 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:16.230
 a matt top coat can also be very 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:18.810
 pretty on the other angles I have everything 

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:20.440
 simply put rhinestones in the shape of 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:23.290
 diamond 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:25.240
 so here is the result if one of the causes 

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:27.340
 do not suit you perfectly like me 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:29.050
 here it is not worth starting again 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:30.430
 every time you can everything 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.140
 just ask yourself what's wrong 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.840
 not to improve it next time 

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:37.120
 me for example here to improve it 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.800
 I used acrylic paint to 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.500
 the place of watercolor only for 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.300
 the white I also used a color 

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:45.730
 clearer children I find that the 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:47.680
 made more fun and I used a top 

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:50.680
 coat match on the padded effect instead 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:53.080
 lacquered top coat you can also 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:55.390
 subscribe to my channel follow me on my 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:57.400
 blog or social networks or clicked 

00:06:55.390 --> 00:07:00.630
 on the bottom two images if you have 

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.630
 want to drink a little more
