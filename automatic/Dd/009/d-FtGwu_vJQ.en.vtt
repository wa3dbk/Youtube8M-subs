twist<00:06:25.500> mountain<00:06:25.980> because<00:06:27.020> cub<00:06:28.020> 2<00:06:28.230> is<00:06:28.470> a<00:06:29.570> 45

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:30.570 
twist mountain because cub 2 is a 45

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:33.790 
twist mountain because cub 2 is a 45
percent<00:06:30.780> there<00:06:31.350> I<00:06:31.680> might<00:06:32.400> go<00:06:32.520> there<00:06:32.760> to<00:06:32.910> hunt

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:33.800 
percent there I might go there to hunt

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.470 
percent there I might go there to hunt
because<00:06:34.800> I<00:06:35.220> don't<00:06:35.820> really<00:06:36.030> want<00:06:36.270> another

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:36.480 
because I don't really want another

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.320 
because I don't really want another
shiny<00:06:36.840> man<00:06:37.050> through<00:06:37.350> and<00:06:37.620> I<00:06:38.130> it's<00:06:38.850> only<00:06:39.060> ten

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:39.330 
shiny man through and I it's only ten

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:41.930 
shiny man through and I it's only ten
percent<00:06:39.720> for<00:06:39.870> BAE<00:06:40.020> r2<00:06:40.320> here<00:06:40.590> so<00:06:41.250> like<00:06:41.550> I<00:06:41.670> really

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:41.940 
percent for BAE r2 here so like I really

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:45.380 
percent for BAE r2 here so like I really
don't<00:06:42.240> think<00:06:42.330> I<00:06:43.430> should<00:06:44.430> keep<00:06:44.850> hunting<00:06:45.090> here

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:45.390 
don't think I should keep hunting here

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:47.960 
don't think I should keep hunting here
so<00:06:45.930> I<00:06:46.200> think<00:06:46.320> I'm<00:06:46.500> gonna<00:06:46.590> go<00:06:46.740> back<00:06:47.010> I<00:06:47.400> don't

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:47.970 
so I think I'm gonna go back I don't

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:50.540 
so I think I'm gonna go back I don't
really<00:06:48.180> want<00:06:48.420> to<00:06:48.480> go<00:06:48.600> to<00:06:48.740> root<00:06:49.740> seven<00:06:50.190> I<00:06:50.310> think

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:50.550 
really want to go to root seven I think

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:52.010 
really want to go to root seven I think
that's<00:06:50.730> where<00:06:50.910> it<00:06:50.970> was<00:06:51.090> because<00:06:51.510> I<00:06:51.750> already

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:52.020 
that's where it was because I already

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:55.760 
that's where it was because I already
got<00:06:52.200> two<00:06:52.260> Chinese<00:06:52.800> there<00:06:53.160> and<00:06:54.170> I<00:06:55.170> don't<00:06:55.230> want

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:55.770 
got two Chinese there and I don't want

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:57.440 
got two Chinese there and I don't want
the<00:06:55.920> other<00:06:56.040> ones<00:06:56.310> so<00:06:56.790> I<00:06:56.820> think<00:06:57.090> I'm<00:06:57.210> just<00:06:57.330> gonna

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:57.450 
the other ones so I think I'm just gonna

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:00.260 
the other ones so I think I'm just gonna
go<00:06:57.660> to<00:06:58.190> twist<00:06:59.190> mountain<00:06:59.610> and<00:06:59.760> see<00:07:00.030> what<00:07:00.150> I<00:07:00.180> can

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:00.270 
go to twist mountain and see what I can

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:02.930 
go to twist mountain and see what I can
do<00:07:00.600> I<00:07:00.780> might<00:07:01.320> progress<00:07:01.710> through<00:07:01.890> the<00:07:02.010> game<00:07:02.640> a

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:02.940 
do I might progress through the game a

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:04.250 
do I might progress through the game a
little<00:07:03.180> bit<00:07:03.450> because<00:07:03.630> that's<00:07:03.990> what<00:07:04.110> I<00:07:04.140> did

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:04.260 
little bit because that's what I did

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.340 
little bit because that's what I did
after<00:07:05.010> the<00:07:05.340> last<00:07:05.550> hunt<00:07:05.880> and<00:07:06.090> I<00:07:06.420> got<00:07:06.780> the<00:07:06.930> shiny

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:07.350 
after the last hunt and I got the shiny

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:11.720 
after the last hunt and I got the shiny
