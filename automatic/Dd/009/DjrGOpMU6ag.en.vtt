showing you flashlights and Minecraft

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.639 
showing you flashlights and Minecraft
and<00:00:57.360> as<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.660> can<00:00:57.809> see<00:00:57.989> now<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.260> have<00:00:58.350> my

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
and as you can see now I have my

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.670 
and as you can see now I have my
flashlight<00:00:58.980> activated<00:00:59.940> but<00:01:00.090> when<00:01:00.270> I<00:01:00.500> get<00:01:01.500> off

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
flashlight activated but when I get off

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.750 
flashlight activated but when I get off
of<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.399> becomes<00:01:03.120> dark<00:01:03.420> so<00:01:04.320> this<00:01:04.830> uses<00:01:05.129> a

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
of it it becomes dark so this uses a

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.000 
of it it becomes dark so this uses a
clock<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:06.780> hook<00:01:07.170> up<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.500> command<00:01:07.770> block

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
clock that hook up to command block

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.109 
clock that hook up to command block
which<00:01:08.280> does<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.909> enchantment<00:01:09.570> level<00:01:09.659> zero<00:01:10.200> so

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
which does the enchantment level zero so

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.520 
which does the enchantment level zero so
when<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.240> have<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.540> enchantment<00:01:13.140> always

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
when you have the enchantment always

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.160 
when you have the enchantment always
gives<00:01:13.799> an<00:01:13.920> output<00:01:14.070> on<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.840> comparator<00:01:15.840> but

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
gives an output on the comparator but

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.050 
gives an output on the comparator but
when<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.380> hold<00:01:16.619> an<00:01:16.950> item<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:17.460> can<00:01:17.520> have<00:01:17.880> the

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
when you hold an item that can have the

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.480 
when you hold an item that can have the
enchantment<00:01:18.570> turns<00:01:19.110> off<00:01:19.380> now<00:01:19.799> if<00:01:19.920> I<00:01:20.009> do<00:01:20.070> game

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
enchantment turns off now if I do game

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.940 
enchantment turns off now if I do game
room<00:01:21.409> game<00:01:22.409> or<00:01:23.060> command<00:01:24.530> block

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
room game or command block

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.399 
room game or command block
I'll<00:01:26.610> put<00:01:27.560> true<00:01:28.909> you<00:01:29.909> can<00:01:30.030> see<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.570> will<00:01:30.689> spam

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
I'll put true you can see it will spam

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.830 
I'll put true you can see it will spam
that<00:01:31.619> selected<00:01:32.189> enchanting<00:01:32.670> cannot<00:01:33.030> can't<00:01:33.720> be

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
that selected enchanting cannot can't be

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.450 
that selected enchanting cannot can't be
added<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.290> target<00:01:34.619> don't<00:01:34.740> always<00:01:34.950> do<00:01:35.250> that

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
added to the target don't always do that

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.359 
added to the target don't always do that
so<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:36.360> want<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.600> do<00:01:36.720> false<00:01:37.500> if<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:37.979> want<00:01:38.220> it

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
so you want to do false if you want it

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.130 
so you want to do false if you want it
don't<00:01:38.490> like<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:38.909> so<00:01:39.479> that's<00:01:39.659> whenever<00:01:39.960> you

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
don't like that so that's whenever you

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.660 
don't like that so that's whenever you
do<00:01:40.320> this<00:01:40.619> sort<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:40.979> thing<00:01:41.130> with<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.369> in<00:01:41.430> chain

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
do this sort of thing with the in chain

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.830 
do this sort of thing with the in chain
command<00:01:42.000> so<00:01:42.869> when<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.320> hold<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:44.640> turns<00:01:45.540> off

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
command so when you hold it it turns off

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.109 
command so when you hold it it turns off
which<00:01:46.229> in<00:01:46.470> vs<00:01:46.979> which<00:01:47.220> activate<00:01:47.759> this<00:01:47.880> piston

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
which in vs which activate this piston

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.039 
which in vs which activate this piston
which<00:01:48.780> acts<00:01:49.079> as<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.860> power<00:01:50.340> block<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:51.000> this<00:01:51.180> and

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
which acts as a power block to this and

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.469 
which acts as a power block to this and
this<00:01:52.320> just<00:01:52.619> gives<00:01:52.860> you<00:01:53.040> night<00:01:53.790> vision<00:01:54.210> for<00:01:54.450> a

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
this just gives you night vision for a

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.100 
this just gives you night vision for a
second<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.939> I<00:01:56.939> try<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.329> make<00:01:57.509> this<00:01:57.659> as<00:01:57.840> fast

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
second so and I try to make this as fast

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.840 
second so and I try to make this as fast
as<00:01:58.259> possible<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.979> can<00:01:59.130> use<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.280> hopper<00:01:59.579> clock

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
as possible you can use a hopper clock

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.880 
as possible you can use a hopper clock
will<00:02:00.149> go<00:02:00.180> slow<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:00.630> want<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.079> use<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.409> one-take

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
will go slow I want to use a one-take

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.959 
will go slow I want to use a one-take
polish<00:02:02.280> clock<00:02:02.579> so<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.750> makes<00:02:03.960> it<00:02:04.170> go<00:02:04.320> quicker

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:04.969 
polish clock so that makes it go quicker

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:07.789 
polish clock so that makes it go quicker
this<00:02:05.969> can<00:02:06.149> also<00:02:06.299> be<00:02:06.479> done<00:02:06.780> with<00:02:06.840> torches<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.590> a

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
this can also be done with torches and a

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.160 
this can also be done with torches and a
clear<00:02:08.069> command<00:02:08.340> but<00:02:08.640> it<00:02:08.849> creams<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:09.750> creates

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
clear command but it creams it creates

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.770 
clear command but it creams it creates
like<00:02:10.410> not<00:02:11.129> a<00:02:11.160> realistic<00:02:11.849> effect<00:02:12.239> so<00:02:12.450> I<00:02:12.480> just

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
like not a realistic effect so I just

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.880 
like not a realistic effect so I just
used<00:02:12.959> to<00:02:13.020> go<00:02:13.080> and<00:02:13.319> show

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
used to go and show

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.210 
used to go and show
so<00:02:14.549> this<00:02:14.849> is<00:02:15.000> very<00:02:15.239> simple<00:02:15.810> not<00:02:16.409> a<00:02:16.439> complicated

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
so this is very simple not a complicated

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.979 
so this is very simple not a complicated
concept<00:02:17.909> if<00:02:18.090> you<00:02:18.180> have<00:02:18.299> any<00:02:18.540> questions
