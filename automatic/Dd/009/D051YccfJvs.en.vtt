00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
one had to do with the shedding because

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.359 
one had to do with the shedding because
but<00:01:24.869> actually<00:01:24.900> look<00:01:25.320> at<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.500> end<00:01:25.710> even<00:01:26.040> where

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
but actually look at the end even where

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.130 
but actually look at the end even where
I<00:01:26.400> seal<00:01:26.790> them<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.240> was<00:01:27.360> still<00:01:27.600> shedding<00:01:27.869> or

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
I seal them it was still shedding or

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.080 
I seal them it was still shedding or
coming<00:01:28.860> out<00:01:28.950> there<00:01:29.250> so<00:01:29.700> that's<00:01:29.880> why<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.030> think

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
coming out there so that's why I think

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.600 
coming out there so that's why I think
the<00:01:30.299> shedding<00:01:30.689> was<00:01:30.840> coming<00:01:31.140> from<00:01:31.290> but<00:01:32.189> this

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610
