is is we killer tolerance and basically
this<00:01:51.540> is<00:01:51.720> so<00:01:51.899> that<00:01:52.159> Monsanto<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.340> other

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
this is so that Monsanto and other

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.020 
this is so that Monsanto and other
pesticide<00:01:54.780> manufacturers<00:01:55.439> can<00:01:55.740> sell<00:01:56.070> and

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
pesticide manufacturers can sell and

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.789 
pesticide manufacturers can sell and
have<00:01:57.240> farmers<00:01:57.570> blast<00:01:57.869> even<00:01:58.110> more<00:01:58.380> we<00:01:58.530> killer

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
have farmers blast even more we killer

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.889

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
on our food crops which is totally

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.450 
on our food crops which is totally
unsustainable<00:02:01.140> it's<00:02:01.680> creating<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.159> huge

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460

you<00:02:10.440> from<00:02:10.739> Steve<00:02:11.099> on<00:02:11.250> that<00:02:11.459> so<00:02:11.730> these<00:02:11.940> are

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
you from Steve on that so these are

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.180 
you from Steve on that so these are
genetically<00:02:12.569> modified

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
genetically modified

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.490 
genetically modified
seeds<00:02:13.400> I<00:02:13.550> think<00:02:13.760> we're<00:02:13.880> talking<00:02:14.030> about

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
seeds I think we're talking about

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.870 
seeds I think we're talking about
specifically<00:02:15.500> right<00:02:15.830> but<00:02:16.070> but<00:02:16.310> their<00:02:16.460> weed

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
specifically right but but their weed

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.840 
specifically right but but their weed
resistant<00:02:17.510> or<00:02:17.800> yeah<00:02:18.800> so<00:02:18.980> I<00:02:19.040> appreciate<00:02:19.670> the

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
resistant or yeah so I appreciate the

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.390 
resistant or yeah so I appreciate the
thing<00:02:20.360> that<00:02:20.510> has<00:02:20.630> a<00:02:21.130> ideological<00:02:22.130> opposition

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
thing that has a ideological opposition

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.940 
thing that has a ideological opposition
to<00:02:23.390> the<00:02:23.600> technology<00:02:23.960> but<00:02:24.560> I<00:02:24.590> don't<00:02:24.800> think

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
to the technology but I don't think

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.610 
to the technology but I don't think
government<00:02:25.640> should<00:02:25.700> mandate<00:02:26.410> ideology<00:02:27.410> on

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
that do you think that if we just

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.330 
that do you think that if we just
labeled<00:04:33.349> the<00:04:33.470> food<00:04:33.680> that<00:04:33.860> was<00:04:34.039> not
