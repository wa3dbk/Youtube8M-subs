 Here you see one in the background 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:50.190
 music style gameplay so let's say it so 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:53.650
 not in 69 is something else nice 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.629

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.860
 cool card because there is hardly any 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:02.050
 come on because we play racing cars here 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.049

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:18.190
 effector that's a mercedes , so to speak 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.869
 a mercedes cut of the sls has 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.430
 a bit of jaguar, too 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:24.460
 You know, I'm so small 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.830
 mercedes fan boy and yes I have 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.000
 neat money in a relatively short time 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.619
 I already have my own 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.780

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.759
 with the online game a few small ones 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:40.119
 say yes it was like this I have problems 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:42.250
 a white hat broken because white 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.200
 maybe one or the other something 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.189
 that means in any case can 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.259
 I just give you this stretch 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:50.320
 recommend to gamble with friends 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.909
 It also makes this general 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.119
 he online I can tell you so 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:57.759
 give a little resonance to the game or 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:00.130
 the mode so online gta power 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.049
 Great fun especially with friendly men 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.659
 playing with friends is the game 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.850
 really awesome there can be no call of duty 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.590
 keep up came almost no play 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.179
 keep up because you just stuff so much 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.580
 can do with his friends 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.470
 you can against each other the 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.960
 Apartments you can look at together 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:20.470
 watch tv you can of course auto 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.600
 anything and me shoot ahead 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.460
 I also want you in the next videos 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.410
 Show like you might as well 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.170
 own apartment can get 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.090
 as you just cash much faster 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.739
 there could be a few 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.110
 pretty cool missions and then stop 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.660
 also some nice tracks where you can 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.250
 can make a car race 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.260
 and then in a short time very much 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.420
 gets a lot of money if you win or 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.950
 also one of the back seats is 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.750
 he gets to keep almost always applies 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.500
 and just drop in there 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.450
 to surprise 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.580
 Well , let's get to the actual 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.620
 thing I want to address because that 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.030
 I gta pretty much like that is now 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.370
 Probably clear to everyone 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.130
 but I'm just always pretty 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.230
 interested in what you are passing over here 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.200
 online think i think most 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.300
 Playing is also pretty good and that 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.910
 best I at least right now 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.460
 when driving , of course, are the 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:13.650
 so just run through the city 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.020
 heating also made some fun and 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.000
 brave little in front of other players 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.730
 but really fat cars with 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.980
 own carts that goes off right there 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.150
 I also have a few in front of you soon 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.770
 community if to do it where you can 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.960
 I have already worked together in 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:30.240
 the last videos where we announced 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.850
 then everyone will play gta together 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:35.730
 and a bit mischievous will be there 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.690
 There are certainly some nice ideas there 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.830
 you can also put a few in the 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.420
 Write comments 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.150
 but I still think it best 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:45.630
 drive with highspeed through the area 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:48.300
 and listen to the radio 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:51.600
 I've been there for ages 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:54.750
 my first gta a huge fan of the 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.790
 radios I always think like this 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.380
 There are such brilliant radio stations 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.540
 not really in real life 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.010
 because I can tell you that when 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.660
 I would have my own car now 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.550
 Incidentally, I could do with a slow 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.630
 I'm 17 already 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.000
 from not even started 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.440
 that is really embarrassing so slow would be 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.180
 I make me clean real time 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.310
 but now i would have my own car 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.720
 I would be really fat on the highway 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.090
 I would drive everything first 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.709
 otherwise download from the gta in the radio 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.959
 and then listen 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.130
 furthermore, they are so ingenious songs 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.800
 compiled 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:30.120
 alone through gta vice city for example 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:32.370
 i was playing miami in the 80s 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.230
 a huge fan of 80s music 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.360
 I mean I'm not in 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:39.540
 born in the 80s but still 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.760
 I really think 80s just awesome 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.060
 So I would like to be in these waves 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.130
 these 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.020
 At that time, the world was born and 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.940
 would drive correctly 80s music 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.310
 You can still do that now or maybe 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.830
 I'm also a hip rap 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.389
 the taste came in part and 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.790
 also on various other songs 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:59.880
 even britney a lot i spears 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:02.370
 strangely since gta 5 really awesome 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.320
 just because on a transmitter every now and then 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.570
 and britney spears song is running or 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:08.160
 some even rihanna i mean i know 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.630
 not if you have to look at yourself 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.700
 young people stand when you rihanna cool 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.950
 so the music is now mine 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.970
 probably quite nice for years if you 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.780
 Now not money from the husband 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:18.870
 is beaten 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:21.479
 or from the friend so I always find 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.639
 when you hear the song in the gta he is 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:26.910
 really awesome maybe just lies 

00:05:23.639 --> 00:05:30.660
 just because you casually fast car 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:33.030
 drives and drive by but does gta the 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:35.160
 songs that rockstar gets here 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:36.810
 which usually harms bombs 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.850
 Of course you can not do that now 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:41.940
 internet may show so that now 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:43.979
 do not do with gta let's play with radio 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.200
 because the strike risk is quite big 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:48.210
 is because of the gema and I think so 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.270
 already a pity because I mean that 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:53.370
 radio in gta trick pretty much to that 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:56.190
 atmosphere in it is something completely different 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:58.140
 if you now with a fat his 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:00.600
 mission is done while you're driving 

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.860
 drive or stop nothing heard that 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.510
 makes in my eyes at least one 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.550
 big difference but maybe think 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:09.000
 I'm just so my favorite radio in 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:11.760
 gta 5 is in any case the nonstop 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.550
 FM radio so I am in gta at least 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:17.910
 an important popfans by the way I think 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:21.000
 even in the radios santos where you like that 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:23.820
 hip hop rap moderate also testifies quite cool 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.080
 and yet the radio miro park I know 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:28.289
 Not what I should call it 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:29.760
 So some people call this hit star 

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:33.419
 I do not want radio stations now 

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:35.610
 necessarily mine but otherwise there is still 

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:37.800
 oh yes exactly the country of 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:39.780
 Radio station for also awesome in particular 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:42.570
 when one year with a truck 

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:45.570
 driving through the area and possible for 

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:48.780
 race is britney spears some of the 

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:51.849
 hammer here is the chemistry tomorrow 

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:54.399
 that sounds pretty ridiculous to me 

00:06:51.849 --> 00:06:55.300
 perhaps one or the other what 

00:06:54.399 --> 00:06:56.830
 I mean that 

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:59.559
 my question to you is definitely 

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:01.599
 what do you have for his favorite? 

00:06:59.559 --> 00:07:03.279
 radio station in gta 5 

00:07:01.599 --> 00:07:06.039
 or maybe in the past 

00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:08.679
 share gta and when do you prefer to listen ? 

00:07:06.039 --> 00:07:11.080
 radio maybe also private so radio 

00:07:08.679 --> 00:07:12.969
 I almost do not hear at home 

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:15.159
 Actually only in the car is also logical 

00:07:12.969 --> 00:07:17.319
 and once again briefly back to gta 

00:07:15.159 --> 00:07:19.839
 Just write me your favorite 

00:07:17.319 --> 00:07:21.759
 dare and then in combination with 

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:24.159
 the radio station that loves to listen and 

00:07:21.759 --> 00:07:28.539
 then, of course, with your favorite 

00:07:24.159 --> 00:07:30.939
 song from the gta 5 radio boxer 

00:07:28.539 --> 00:07:32.469
 does really good work that with the 

00:07:30.939 --> 00:07:34.389
 video soon hardly natural again 

00:07:32.469 --> 00:07:35.949
 a few other things yes I hope so 

00:07:34.389 --> 00:07:37.360
 you liked it if you like it 

00:07:35.949 --> 00:07:38.139
 Of course you can take rating 

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.209
 let there 

00:07:38.139 --> 00:07:42.509
 See you next time and see 

00:07:40.209 --> 00:07:42.509
 adios
