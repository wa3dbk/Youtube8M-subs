00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.299
 ah 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:22.720
 how about youtube friends your friend talks to you 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:25.179
 of always is of mini today 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.660
 I come to bring a short video of a 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:31.960
 new update for this topic that 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:35.699
 a few days ago I had talked about him this 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:38.739
 new theme is about the next in wii 1 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:43.839
 true and as I showed you in the video 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:46.470
 previous because this topic comes with 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:46.470
 certain 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:54.550
 very very good configurations very 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:57.250
 easy to install true but the 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:00.850
 creator of this topic that I wrote carrot 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:04.059
 and did a new update on the day of 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:06.790
 today true and I want to take it you 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:10.900
 briefly so that they see the new thing that has 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:15.400
 brought this item because it brings a few 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:19.270
 changes in reality, because what has made me 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:23.010
 seemed pretty good these changes 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:27.660
 that has brought this creator 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:31.020
 is quite dedicated to what is the 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:33.300
 issue of whether to take out is this new 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:38.130
 update of the topic I'm going to show you 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:42.100
 why you just saw is number one and 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:46.030
 number two is this 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:49.390
 similarly as you can see this 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.970
 it looks almost the same but in reality 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:56.290
 as he explained the changes he has 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:58.990
 brought are slightly noticeable but 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.480
 pretty good as you can notice in the 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.530
 watch area 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.530
 there is a change 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.630
 simulates an appearance as if they were 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.750
 the numbers mounted very differently to 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:15.490
 how is the other shown as you can see 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:19.610
 the color is the same 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:22.670
 another thing that has brought then is the 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:26.240
 change of the rich also the icon 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:29.460
 of the internet messages has also 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:32.940
 changed as you can notice 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.260
 there is how you notice the change of 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.650
 the vehicles 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:41.310
 another thing that this creator 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:45.240
 rugby carrots has not brought that I think 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:50.160
 excellent has been the configuration of 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:53.790
 the colors whether we want to leave it 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:57.080
 by default as what comes in itself or 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:03:00.380
 we want to customize you 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:04.900
 the colors we will change the color 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.900
 so they can appreciate how it changes 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:12.379
 to look for a color that is 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.860
 which is appreciated quite well to climb 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:14.860
 the tone 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.370
 there is 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.240
 how can you see the change 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:32.000
 we left this this part here as 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.960
 you can notice has totally changed the 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.170
 color and appearance of the subject itself 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:40.410
 true 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:43.870
 I quite liked what has been 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:47.470
 this update is already 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:50.159
 much easier what the turn of the 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:53.970
 icons from one side to another truth 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:58.019
 some icons also updated them 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:04:01.930
 I think this change is excellent 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:04.740
 another thing that also this 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:08.660
 Creator, then, no 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:12.390
 added also to this topic has been 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:15.040
 because we can customize much better 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.410
 the appearance 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.090
 of who you are what you are and how you 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:22.210
 sample 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:25.720
 truth is shown totally different 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:27.970
 because in the past it showed what 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:32.530
 that was the 24- hour clock 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:35.580
 now we added what the 12 clock 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:39.550
 hours that I find excellent since 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:42.090
 many sometimes we do not understand and I tell them 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:45.630
 Why does it happen to me? 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:48.419
 those watches that sometimes put 24 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:52.320
 true hours and here we can 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:55.770
 customize if you already wish so do not 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:58.889
 like suddenly the color that you will 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:02.460
 they can touch the button that comes 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:06.449
 here that comes by default we play here 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:11.090
 and immediately return the subject to its 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:14.889
 been normal as you can see true 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.889
 if they want to change 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:21.900
 what is the color of the equal clock 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:21.900
 way we can also change it 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.729
 so that it is visualized totally 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.630
 different 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:28.630
 there is the clock 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:35.520
 true quite good how is visualized 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:37.680
 the color you want to put the good ones 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:41.430
 I put that color so you can 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:45.030
 notice the change that itself as the 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:47.970
 creator has done we played in the same way 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:51.030
 the outside lines change also from 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:54.430
 color depending on the way that 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:59.020
 you want to customize it 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:06:02.980
 Well, everything has really been everything 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:05.260
 that I brought to you today about 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:08.200
 these changes of 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:11.400
