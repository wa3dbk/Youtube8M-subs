00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.350
 I have a spectator's name is dirk 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.509
 a few very interesting recordings 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.160
 received from the 80s 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.510
 the next time a few more things 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.250
 that's unbelievably funny 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.809
 planned good old tv announcer 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.900
 they do not exist in the meantime 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.670
 more and so on what I show you 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.930
 but would like to be a very interesting 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.390
 ard guide technology from the year 1986 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.550
 back then it was like that and rtl 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.529
 sat 1 straight to the start 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.970
 of course, too , were gone 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.949
 correspondingly small flame 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.600
 There was hardly a human being there at the time 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.010
 senders and they had 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.739
 no money at all for a great 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.200
 program with big investments 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.480
 to put on the legs that were ancient 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.370
 they ran after than 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.440
 movies and so on yet it is 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.680
 interesting with what arrogance and 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.440
 The idea was very stupid at the time 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.030
 private broadcaster is above all 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.980
 it also involuntarily funny namely 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.480
 if you look at how the area 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.309
 even nowadays you look 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.860
 Good day in the ard guide technology 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.320
 yes we are still not the old ones 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.049
 just great in design or sits down 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.950
 in the presentation but continue with 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.950
 critical content 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.290
 there are our new screens 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:24.320
 competitors of sat 1 and radio 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:27.200
 tele luxembourg other talents da da begins 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.230
 every day as a start to the big show 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.920
 not exactly spectacular 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:33.020
 Of course, consumer friendly is the 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.270
 Combination of advertising and program 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.490
 There the sat 1 changes to a singer 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.250
 suddenly the theme and moderated for 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:44.090
 the detergent manufacturer ariel 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:46.490
 Lotto play something like the guide 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.800
 Technique of angry advertisers 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.050
 it does not have to take it into consideration 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.240
 the channels therefore hardly give 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.390
 or can you imagine that one 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.580
 Company sponsorships sponsored 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.860
 or even on the send business financially 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:04.330
 involved is that such a company 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.140
 yourself in the program of sat 1 or rtl plus 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.320
 would be criticized 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.570
 but our guide also costs 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.690
 about half a little bit of hers 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:17.870
 fees and all 50 guidebooks per year 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.989
 cost as much as a phone call namely 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.700
 20 pfennig well there you could too 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.500
 Shake out what this whole quito 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.330
 hometown schnauze in the ard so on 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.950
 Fees cost this whole daily 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.070
 soaps and as far as I'll sometimes 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.360
 very interesting from today's point of view 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.739
 yes it goes to walter in the show and 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.500
 then find a way how should i do it 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.600
 call a kind stone workshop the 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.950
 technical means were still there then 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.950
 not like today 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.060
 the explanation being that of the moderator 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.100
 Here from the one I also find one 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.019
 a bit strange because so behind the moon 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.930
 the ard can not have lived 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:52.459
 can you 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.830
 and so the offer looks for the 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.980
 We have it chosen 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.560
 kabelsender berlin cut on 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.560
 cassette and not always perfect though 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.900
 professional technique for the recording of 17 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.930
 we too can not leave the channel 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.690
 sleeves shake interesting the area 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.549
 So he was not capable of doing so 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.160
 tv channels simultaneously with too 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:19.160
 cut as I mean that was in 1986 ago 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.590
 22 years since I was there I was 15 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.690
 years old and far as I remember 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.489
 That should not be a big one 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.290
 have been technical challenge 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.700
 but I do not know how it was at the time 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.879
 the ard was and 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.709
 Not at all with the advice technology 

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:35.180
 mind you not 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.349
 then it starts with the very thin 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.870
 and it is a very interesting one 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:41.540
 looking back a year to 1980 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.230
 typical friday evening in february im 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:47.420
 German television they look times 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:49.310

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.349

 at the same time with mainz as it sings 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:10.099
 and laughs 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:15.440
 the zdf with the rag and in the third north 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:18.709

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:26.180
 and ddr2 a musical wind of 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:28.819
 hike additionally in the cable sat 1 with 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:33.020
 the death ranch already twice in the 

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:35.419

 yes and who will always be behind them 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.710
 now for sure understand why 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.669
 Video stores back then as mushrooms from the 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.860
