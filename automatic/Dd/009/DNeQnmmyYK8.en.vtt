 be part of the plan with cloud and most 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.340
 pretty the youthful afternoon of today you will see this 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.960
 so what is 24 is a bit hard the 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.899
 people are a bit difficult to come out but 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.460
 however , the people and the 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:44.050
 We spent a good time with all the 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.219
 reggae music lovers where are you going to 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.170

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:49.719
 family with the family you know how it is 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.480
 true with my day my wife and nuanced 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:54.489
 in the neighborhood I change my house of course 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.430

 but this day people also know their 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:09.590
 trajectory but the question of rigor the 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:09.590
 today how much kilo music already 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.320

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:16.570
 that only of the guilty that they 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.909
