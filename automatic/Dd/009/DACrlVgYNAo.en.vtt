00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:11.809 
to show you how to make my volan fusion

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:14.799 
to show you how to make my volan fusion
wheel<00:00:11.929> bo<00:00:12.290> lan<00:00:13.099> which<00:00:14.059> is<00:00:14.240> the<00:00:14.389> constellation

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:14.809 
wheel bo lan which is the constellation

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:16.780 
wheel bo lan which is the constellation
for<00:00:15.200> the<00:00:15.290> flying<00:00:15.530> fish<00:00:15.889> it<00:00:16.400> goes<00:00:16.610> with<00:00:16.759> my

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:16.790 
for the flying fish it goes with my

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:20.439 
for the flying fish it goes with my
energy<00:00:17.270> ring<00:00:17.450> Cepheus<00:00:17.930> which<00:00:18.170> is<00:00:18.320> king<00:00:19.449> it's

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:20.449 
energy ring Cepheus which is king it's

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:22.870 
energy ring Cepheus which is king it's
not<00:00:21.199> difficult<00:00:21.470> but<00:00:21.980> it's<00:00:22.430> a<00:00:22.520> really<00:00:22.640> good

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 
not difficult but it's a really good

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.599 
not difficult but it's a really good
fusion<00:00:23.210> wheel<00:00:23.330> it's<00:00:23.570> very<00:00:23.810> violent<00:00:24.380> but<00:00:24.770> when

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:25.609 
fusion wheel it's very violent but when

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:27.070 
fusion wheel it's very violent but when
it's<00:00:25.820> combined<00:00:26.119> with<00:00:26.240> its<00:00:26.480> performance<00:00:26.900> tip

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:27.080 
it's combined with its performance tip

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.189 
it's combined with its performance tip
and<00:00:27.260> track<00:00:27.500> its<00:00:27.890> kind<00:00:28.430> of<00:00:28.550> balanced<00:00:29.050> so<00:00:30.050> it

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:30.199 
and track its kind of balanced so it

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:34.150 
and track its kind of balanced so it
makes<00:00:30.349> it<00:00:30.500> a<00:00:30.619> really<00:00:30.769> good<00:00:31.269> um<00:00:32.680> lego<00:00:33.680> beyblade

going to the left and you're going to
put<00:01:27.320> them<00:01:27.470> on<00:01:28.659> next<00:01:29.659> to<00:01:29.750> them<00:01:32.439> so<00:01:33.439> let's

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
put them on next to them so let's

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:35.249 
put them on next to them so let's
lighting<00:01:33.979> are<00:01:34.159> to<00:01:34.310> see<00:01:34.460> the<00:01:34.549> light<00:01:34.729> goons

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
lighting are to see the light goons

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:38.050 
lighting are to see the light goons
you're<00:01:36.259> going<00:01:36.409> to<00:01:36.470> put<00:01:36.650> it<00:01:36.710> on<00:01:36.770> like<00:01:36.950> that<00:01:37.220> see

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
you're going to put it on like that see

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.370 
you're going to put it on like that see
how<00:01:38.240> that's<00:01:38.509> kind<00:01:38.720> of<00:01:38.960> thermodynamic<00:01:39.770> ish<00:01:41.380> and

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
how that's kind of thermodynamic ish and

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.330 
how that's kind of thermodynamic ish and
then<00:01:42.439> you're<00:01:42.920> going<00:01:43.070> to<00:01:43.159> get<00:01:43.400> to<00:01:44.680> 1<00:01:45.680> by<00:01:45.920> 3<00:01:46.189> is

on<00:02:16.819> the<00:02:17.240> park<00:02:17.890> so<00:02:20.140> looks<00:02:21.140> like<00:02:21.230> at<00:02:21.500> this<00:02:25.480> Volans

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
on the park so looks like at this Volans

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.520 
on the park so looks like at this Volans
fairly<00:02:27.080> simple<00:02:27.500> it's<00:02:27.770> just<00:02:28.150> yeah<00:02:29.150> you<00:02:30.080> see<00:02:30.319> and

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
fairly simple it's just yeah you see and

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:31.750 
fairly simple it's just yeah you see and
so<00:02:31.069> you're<00:02:31.220> going<00:02:31.340> to<00:02:31.400> have<00:02:31.459> something

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
so you're going to have something

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.040 
so you're going to have something
looking<00:02:32.030> like<00:02:32.120> this<00:02:32.420> now<00:02:32.630> you<00:02:32.660> should<00:02:33.020> have

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
looking like this now you should have

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.030 
looking like this now you should have
this<00:02:33.470> and<00:02:33.920> you're<00:02:34.459> going<00:02:34.580> to<00:02:34.670> get<00:02:34.820> to<00:02:35.709> one<00:02:36.709> by

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
this and you're going to get to one by

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.960 
this and you're going to get to one by
two<00:02:37.100> by<00:02:37.670> twos<00:02:38.060> I'm<00:02:38.810> guessing<00:02:39.350> Collins<00:02:39.970> and

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
two by twos I'm guessing Collins and

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.090 
two by twos I'm guessing Collins and
you're<00:02:41.090> just<00:02:41.240> going<00:02:41.450> to<00:02:41.540> put<00:02:41.840> them<00:02:42.080> on<00:02:42.440> top<00:02:43.040> of

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
you're just going to put them on top of

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.330 
you're just going to put them on top of
the<00:02:43.640> tooth<00:02:44.600> and<00:02:44.870> this<00:02:45.230> so<00:02:45.709> you<00:02:46.069> get<00:02:46.160> that

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
the tooth and this so you get that

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.840 
the tooth and this so you get that
corner<00:02:49.090> that<00:02:50.090> was<00:02:50.180> a<00:02:50.209> little<00:02:50.500> okay<00:02:51.700> so<00:02:52.700> you're

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
you're going to have the bowlin fusion

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.120 
you're going to have the bowlin fusion
wheel<00:03:43.150> it's<00:03:44.150> very<00:03:44.570> good<00:03:44.900> it's<00:03:45.410> got<00:03:45.590> good<00:03:45.860> stuff

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
wheel it's very good it's got good stuff

good defense it's very heavy and so its

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.400 
good defense it's very heavy and so its
default<00:03:51.200> fusion<00:03:51.769> ring<00:03:51.980> is<00:03:52.630> Cepheus<00:03:53.630> just

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
default fusion ring is Cepheus just

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:03.880 
default fusion ring is Cepheus just
going<00:03:54.590> to<00:03:54.910> put<00:03:55.910> it<00:03:55.940> on

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:10.760 

okay<00:04:04.890> so<00:04:06.260> there<00:04:07.260> and<00:04:07.620> the<00:04:07.950> traffic<00:04:08.730> tip<00:04:09.290> is<00:04:10.290> the

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
okay so there and the traffic tip is the

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:17.930 
okay so there and the traffic tip is the
three-layer<00:04:11.840> SDF<00:04:16.190> so<00:04:17.190> there's<00:04:17.370> no<00:04:17.580> once<00:04:17.790> a

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
three-layer SDF so there's no once a

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.390 
three-layer SDF so there's no once a
phase<00:04:18.150> three<00:04:18.540> lsdf<00:04:19.140> this<00:04:19.920> is<00:04:20.100> the<00:04:20.190> video

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400
