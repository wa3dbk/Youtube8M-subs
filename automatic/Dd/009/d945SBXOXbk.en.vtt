 the sounds of space chess can be 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.020
 a little risky 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.280
 if it's still like the idea of desktop 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.430

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.500
 made this game and should not be 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:52.150
 proud of their work because 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:57.100
 put your logo more a lot of game 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.100
 he could talk 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:08.570

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:10.640
 solve the problem and it's pretty cool 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:13.190
 just shah wisdom characters and 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.320
 star wars itself will not be able to play 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:19.390
 he'll just be dead on the background bye 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.390
 the hatch plays games and does not save him 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:44.590
 Chuya became much slower than I him 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:49.740

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.740

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.930
 how slow is my God 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.820
 In general , I can play games 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.820
 infinity table and please i'm not yet 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:12.760
 ready to die them damn what brutal 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.830
 nastolka here is a small battle animation 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.110
 when two figures collide on the board 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.150
 something like battle honestly leaves me 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.490
 eternal what to see and all this 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.560
 Status of your time and I think I 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:25.060
 switched to sega version because sit 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.250
 that it is really possible to play here 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.020
 included walk animation we just 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.860
 we are transferred to the place of events we look 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.630
 the best parts 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.940
 not that the graphics were very different in 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.560
 this version but the presentation is also much 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.440
 started showing which character is 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:42.060
 what figure is the hatch operator for example 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:45.060
 Caroline Alley and Darth Vader they 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.060
 queens 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.050
 you know with that gait you know what 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.930
 queen's lifestyle penetrate your 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:56.350
 life and guys look yes we have here 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:04:03.700
 seems like a real green jerk to a couple 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:08.320
 they know how wow it was amazing 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:10.570
 mine too can do about pancake graphics 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.390
 understated in this version and you do not understand 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:15.190
 what happens after all this sega sit in the same way 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.570
 he gave a couple of menus to his table you 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.120
 you can just change the board design 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.370
 especially nothing to look at the robbery 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.050
 happens on some sort of board being 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:29.980
 in space that you are very fast 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:32.140
 you crash seriously every figure on 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.540
 the board has an animation of its unique 

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:37.090
 death if you put and all close 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:40.210
 get more than half an hour of animation 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:42.120
 impressive it is so strange and i think they 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.320
 could complete the mission by themselves 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.030
 it is convenient to look for words while notice 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.880
 how loved a character is dying incredibly 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:51.120
 painful and painful death 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:57.440
 true fear 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:57.440

 I repeat but it is just a strange form 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.050
 like all these immortal characters 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:27.150
