 haye the kelter i am other and im 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.089
 moment 21 years old but let's start 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.859
 from the beginning 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.300
 I grew up in a place of 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.580
 to call yourself urban in one 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.679
 actually normal family father mother 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.389
 big sister big brother and me 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.369
 when I was in the fourth grade 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.470
 I noticed that my father was stronger 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.939
 Alcoholic was my mother always has 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.710
 try this as long as possible 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.330
 but then hide there and then 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.320
 after his brain cells from them 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.240
 have passed 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.369
 finger to his wife and his children too 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.810
 when he beat me one day 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.920
 mother had broken a few ribs 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.899
 is she with my siblings 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.000
 undressed I stayed with mine 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.680
 Father until I was 14 until he was also in me 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.570
 a whack of the house beaten 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.070
 I had it all because I had the dishes 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.440
 drawer left open 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.450
 the evil cutlery our family was from 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.520
 since pretty torn and I am then 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.230
 landed in a home there I am then 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.300
 crashed a bit I had none 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.989
 friends and my notes were also total 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.180
 in the basement 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.789
 then I sat in these I call it once 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.559
 Life is still pretty long time 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.480
 then came out of our class 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.510
 vintage about us such a sit-down 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.220
 boy that was then it started at the beginning 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.260
 we totally fuck each other 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.090
 found but at some point we have 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.740
 noticed that we are more similar than 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.549
 we thought and then we have each other 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.869
 teamed up 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.549
 through him I also learned later 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.200
 know jan and now we are 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.390
 No more friends but more like that 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.189
 I am like brothers at 17 then 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.290
 home out in my first own apartment 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.850
 school slowly went uphill again but 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.830
 I did not really know what was in me 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.090
 the city holds the only thing for me 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.430
 was important and really me 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.710
 interested was youtube and so we went 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.360
 so james and jan, we have everything 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.220
 stand and lie and are without 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.009
 training or something else 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.780
 hamburg with then 9000 subscribers 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.610
 We decided youtube very big 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.750
 expand 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.610
 actually a risky number 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.280
 i wish it then studied in 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.439
 hamburg acting and jan directing money 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.149
 was really unbelievably little there me 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.860
 must say the ten months we in 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.659
 Hamburg were something like one 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.579
 fire test to see if we can do it 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.990
 our dream really serious 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.729
 somehow, that's not all 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.439
 worked out as we imagined and 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.420
 we thought the thing with hamburg were 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.520
 Giant mistakes the studies all 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.320
 canceled 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.720
 without having anything and we have 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.720
 We always said two more weeks then 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.610
 let's drop everything yes, too, youtube 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.769
 we had already risked a lot and 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.510
 slowly we had to admit that 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.610
 The thing does not work in these two 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.010
 weeks then came calls from phil of 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.750
 white city ​​and he meant hey I have to 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.810
 meet with you we have something there 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.920
 before any of us knew that's the 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.410
 where we waited all the time 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.330
 did not care what that is much got us 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.760
 then cologne and enabled and we 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.400
 Full time youtube so it is 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.380
 pretty sure that it will continue not without 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.880
 nightmare and that's what we are for 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.010
 really grateful to the three guys 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.090
 And now we are here in Cologne 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.970
 and live our dream 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.069
 Well that was it with roma live - with all 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.870
 what happened so far is what I am 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.849
 Nothing happened to you 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.650
 without reason during that time with me all 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.450
 These bad things did not happen 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.130
 I would not sit here today and 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.650
 we probably would not 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.500
 so everything is good as it is 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.090
 happened so that 's it if you want 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.640
 Of course you can do a few more now 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.040
 Watch other drama live if you like 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.560
 left clicks you will come to the drama live 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.900
 from whitey and if you right click 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.069
 now comes to the identity card screen he 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.120
 just had just seen 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:19.120
 with the meaningful
