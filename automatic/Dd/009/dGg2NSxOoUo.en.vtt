grip he's a standard go all I'm going to

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:40.219 
grip he's a standard go all I'm going to
do<00:01:37.469> is<00:01:37.590> dip<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.479> enter<00:01:39.479> back<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.899> the<00:01:39.990> path

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
do is dip and enter back to the path

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.399 
do is dip and enter back to the path
that<00:01:41.099> doesn't<00:01:41.369> matter<00:01:41.579> where<00:01:41.880> he's<00:01:41.999> gone<00:01:42.409> look

that doesn't matter where he's gone look
at<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.709> as<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:45.560> four<00:01:46.560> point<00:01:46.829> box<00:01:47.130> as<00:01:47.819> shoulder<00:01:48.240> to

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:48.539 
at it as a four point box as shoulder to

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:50.389 
at it as a four point box as shoulder to
hear<00:01:48.779> his<00:01:48.899> hand<00:01:49.169> to<00:01:49.319> there<00:01:49.529> anyone<00:01:49.950> attempts

hear his hand to there anyone attempts
very<00:01:50.609> that<00:01:50.849> going<00:01:50.999> to<00:01:51.060> extend<00:01:51.359> the<00:01:51.509> box<00:01:51.749> and<00:01:51.990> it

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:52.109 
very that going to extend the box and it

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:54.499 
very that going to extend the box and it
becomes<00:01:52.709> a<00:01:52.829> rectangle<00:01:53.429> right<00:01:53.579> doesn't<00:01:54.060> matter

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
becomes a rectangle right doesn't matter

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.929 
becomes a rectangle right doesn't matter
so<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.169> matter<00:01:55.349> where<00:01:55.590> he<00:01:55.649> comes<00:01:55.709> in<00:01:56.039> I<00:01:56.310> tapped
