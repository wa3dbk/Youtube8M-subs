the<00:00:05.180> way<00:00:05.330> we've<00:00:05.540> been<00:00:05.569> scaling<00:00:05.990> it<00:00:06.170> is<00:00:06.319> not

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:07.069 
the way we've been scaling it is not

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:09.879 
the way we've been scaling it is not
necessarily<00:00:07.700> in<00:00:07.910> terms<00:00:08.570> of<00:00:08.750> debt<00:00:09.020> in<00:00:09.559> terms<00:00:09.830> of

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:09.889 
necessarily in terms of debt in terms of

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:12.129 
necessarily in terms of debt in terms of
breath<00:00:10.160> it's<00:00:10.910> in<00:00:11.090> terms<00:00:11.330> of<00:00:11.480> depth<00:00:11.750> so

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:12.139 
breath it's in terms of depth so

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:13.570 
breath it's in terms of depth so
creating<00:00:12.650> more<00:00:12.799> opportunities<00:00:12.860> for

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:13.580 
creating more opportunities for

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.520 
creating more opportunities for
audiences<00:00:14.209> to<00:00:14.330> get<00:00:14.449> involved<00:00:14.660> and<00:00:14.990> to<00:00:15.020> involve

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:15.530 
audiences to get involved and to involve

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:16.870 
audiences to get involved and to involve
others<00:00:15.860> and<00:00:16.070> I<00:00:16.129> think<00:00:16.160> you<00:00:16.670> know<00:00:16.760> the

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:16.880 
others and I think you know the

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.250 
others and I think you know the
community<00:00:17.060> aspects<00:00:17.750> and<00:00:17.810> we<00:00:17.900> always<00:00:18.050> talk

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:18.260 
community aspects and we always talk

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.349 
community aspects and we always talk
about<00:00:18.289> online<00:00:18.619> video<00:00:18.920> is<00:00:19.250> this<00:00:19.430> this<00:00:20.090> great

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:20.359 
about online video is this this great

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:22.840 
about online video is this this great
form<00:00:20.810> of<00:00:20.960> content<00:00:21.410> that's<00:00:21.650> less<00:00:22.280> expensive

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:22.850 
form of content that's less expensive

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.120 
form of content that's less expensive
and<00:00:22.970> easier<00:00:23.090> to<00:00:23.330> produce<00:00:23.480> but<00:00:23.870> in<00:00:24.320> reality<00:00:24.620> it

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
and easier to produce but in reality it

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.680 
and easier to produce but in reality it
provides<00:00:25.490> us<00:00:25.670> this<00:00:25.820> opportunity<00:00:25.970> that

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:26.690 
provides us this opportunity that

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.300 
provides us this opportunity that
television<00:00:26.960> just<00:00:27.260> doesn't<00:00:27.650> and<00:00:27.740> that's<00:00:27.800> this

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
television just doesn't and that's this

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.210 
television just doesn't and that's this
completely<00:00:29.060> interactive<00:00:29.800> environment<00:00:30.800> so

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:31.220 
completely interactive environment so

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.459 
completely interactive environment so
instead<00:00:31.820> of<00:00:31.880> I'm<00:00:32.689> gonna<00:00:32.809> use<00:00:32.930> the<00:00:33.020> e<00:00:33.050> word<00:00:33.289> but

00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:33.469
