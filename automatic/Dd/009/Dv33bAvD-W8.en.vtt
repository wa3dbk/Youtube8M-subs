00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 hi people from youtube I am carlos 1998 or 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:10.110
 'the and I come to analyze the possible 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.650
 return from mp to the ww after bp 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.080
 was fired in 2010 in the wwf and 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.869
 have been since 2011 in new japan 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.970
 wrestling have been making rumors 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.699
 that now that his contract with 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.529
 the Japanese company mpp could return 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:30.840
 to ww as they say in the news of the 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:33.570
 wwf he is negotiating a contract today 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.340
 October 11 that said triple h 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.550
 towards all those who have left the 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.500
 entertainment sport that is the ww that 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.660
 do not think that you can return when 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.700
 want and that his way to return will be 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.070
 easy will have to wait to see what you 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.320
 it happens to my opinion if it returns what 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.739
 they would treat worse than before he left 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.710
 of the wwf of the former superstars of the 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.930
 ww they have returned to the majority after 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.180
 of a few months they begin to treat them as 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.789
 shit fresh from the butt of a 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.040
 horse and if you want an example, I've 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.480
 said to the first two months have they 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.390
 treated well after 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.370
 in having fights like against 3 mb but I've 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.460
 said he is currently on tour with his 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:16.830
 band still has a contract with a ww 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.830
 If I had to say for how long 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.350
 would last the mbt contract would say that year 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.390
 and a half less than to be treated badly 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.150
 and want to go cry to the shell of 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.850
 his mother or not x for the moment 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.270
 would have very difficult things mpp for 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.340
 sign a contract with a ww if I had 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.980
 what to say with whom they would give rivalry 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.080
 would be against of being rbd in my opinion 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.450
 although perhaps it has rivalry with 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.820
 Fandango or someone else who is trying 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.010
 bad or perhaps fight in the tenth n t 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.290
 although they did fight in the n 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.540
 tenth that is like receiving a thousand kicks 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.670
 in the back or perhaps no balls 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.370
 I know but it would be like receiving a thousand kicks 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.920
 as I should be in the new japan 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:02.280
 wrestling or going to another company that does not 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.770
 be the ww because surely they would treat it 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.320
 wrong or at least I think I do not know what 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.420
 you will think because I can not read the 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.310
 mind at least for now maybe 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.290
 someday I fall into waste 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.269
 radioactive or take me to 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.969
 and have powers to read the mind 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:20.489
 anything can happen maybe in the 

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:22.829
 time I was inactive that happened to me 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.390
 but that story we'll leave for another 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:26.909
 day if it does not give me laziness 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.180
 write it would have to wait for the next 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:32.640
 program of the wwf or perhaps on the smart 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.680
 town of today they achieve although surely 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.989
 will know in the raw of next week or 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.480
 for sure they will say it on some page as 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:41.400
 superfights or some other something that 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.159
 I'm so sure I could bet 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.379
 until I cut the balls that will have a 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:48.689
 good return and after a certain time 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.819
 they will treat it for shit and then 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:53.220
 will have it rotting in some brand 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.680
 fighting against others who try for the 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.290
 fuck up fire them along with others 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.109
 that go badly good guys girls 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.060
 convicted drugged and degenerate me 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:05.430
 dismissal for now we'll see each other 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.500
 video that will surely be in another 30 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.489
 days because I am very short of ideas 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.489
 goodbye
