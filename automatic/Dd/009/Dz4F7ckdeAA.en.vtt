00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.600
 if we put ourselves in third person 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:10.690
 take hitter 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.690
 tomás master 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.199
 how are we and good guys are we 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:22.820
 laps with the review of the version of 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:25.010
 the wild 0.1 build 12 that has been a 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.630
 moment at the head and the links go to 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:31.520
 be in the description for both 4.0 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:34.070
 4.0.1 which is for those who have the role 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.070
 of analysis as soon as it got even 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.649
 not stable and I'll put them equally for 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.899
 2.3 as soon as I am already because they look 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:43.879
 it takes a little time to leave 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:46.879
 have equally so do not worry 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.829
 for that reason also the list of changes 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.989
 I hope I do not forget to put it on so 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.999
 they will have it in the description and good 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.339
 in the menu part basically not 

00:00:52.999 --> 00:00:57.350
 change nothing as you know it's just collection 

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:59.629
 of books and that may be the last 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.239
 return in quotes because they know that 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:05.330
 in basically there are still small 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.220
 books that we will soon see in the 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.930
 tester series so saying this 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.930
 we begin with the review 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:16.460
 plus 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.460
 Y 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:40.470
 no no no 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.909
 and good among the things he said in the 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:53.180
 channel or in the list of changes in 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.590
 basically he said that in the goals between 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.500
 the most important things is that the 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.450
 goals can no longer transfer objects or 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.420
 good blocks when playing them for 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.130
 example let's see if we get in 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.480
 third person 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.000
 and take avoid 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.500
 tomasito challenge more tomás and interpreted 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.890
 magisterial 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.830
 and good as I was saying because 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.040
 that can not go through blocks and I see 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.040
 not 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.769
 and left the world or upgrade to another 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.379
 basically I was pushed and left of 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.849
 here of the water and what I had to do is 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:29.010
 put it on the boat because if it does not 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:32.159
 I died and I threw him into these positions of 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:35.099
 life but it was one or another vessel 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:38.430
 likewise he will have to do this follows 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:41.579
 happening that is a good wing block like 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.620
 if he plays in creative he keeps going from that 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:45.750
 ship did not say they repaired it but I keep 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.760
 seeing for example I have the sights towards 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.159
 up and left my finger pressed and 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.319
 when I do so it breaks instantly 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:55.680
 when you have to be a bit of 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:57.720
 coming back and that does not happen there in 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.709
 that moment so if you have not 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.510
 prepared something that in my opinion I hope 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:07.799
 that they see it and the pictures I do not know why 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:10.040
 and are thus the goal happened to my 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:10.040
 picture 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:16.170
 I do not know why it happened to finally 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.760
 the links on the will have in the 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.360
 description never finished doing this 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.920
 construction lol so nothing links in 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.720
 the description to pass download 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.780
 the black wild 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.209
 owen the water pk and the 12 in the 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.730
 description you will find it so much 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:35.520
 2.3 as soon as you have it you are going to 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.530
 have in the description and nothing said 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.300
 I hope you liked it, but for 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.300
 the voice that has a little strange but 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:47.690
 it's because I'm sick so nothing 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:50.570
 we see in the next dance 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.240
 and they fixed the arch bus lol yes 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:55.950
 I had not noticed 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.950
 that's awesome
