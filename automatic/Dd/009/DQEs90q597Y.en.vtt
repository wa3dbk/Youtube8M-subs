00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.320
 hello that such friends welcome today to 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:14.840
 this new video tutorial and today in this 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.630
 I am going to teach you how to create a 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:21.380
 small pretty simple composition and 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.900
 simple in which many people have 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.789
 wondered how the effect of hands 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.650
 well as when you write in a 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.570
 good typewriter it is 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.609
 pretty simple we're just going to 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.340
 need the after effects program and 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:37.010
 patients although it's no no really not 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.829
 it's a lot but we're going to start 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.840
 we started creating a new composition 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:46.219
 the size that you want, I'll go 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:48.250
 to do of hb in take 2 1280 x 720 a 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:51.110
 speed of 25 frames per second 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.360
 it's normal 5 seconds nothing else the 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.520
 composition to make the example already 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.440
 creating our composition we are going to 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.550
 make our text 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.520
 in the text that we want to put 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.520
 we just write it 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.810
 and I'm going to place it in mexico of wines 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.390
 that already having in the text what we're going 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.670
 to do is going to be the trick the trick 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.020
 simplest you have ever seen in life 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.090
 let's go to effects and adjustments 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.390
 pre-established in this part of here 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.610
 from the east if you do not leave them go towards 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.680
 window and we are going to look for the part 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.840
 from here and workspace and they're 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.500
 giving and it will go exactly as it came 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.600
 here they activate the control plus 5 but 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.340
 let's find what is 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.020
 machine and they will leave this here 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.539
 short and does not put the seat not them 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.500
 will come out they have to put the accent 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:45.530
 then let's put it here 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.470
 and it seems that it disappeared by art of 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.690
 magic but it is the effect itself if we give 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:55.369
 play let's see how the effect is done 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:58.850
 and there we have it 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:01.040
 appearing that we already saw it 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.920
 it just looks a little slow and they saw 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.930
 Well, this can be modified, let's go 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.850
 to give him here 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.130
 in this part I am going to travel more or less 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.050
 only 2 seconds in this part of 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.080
 here we are going to download this panel and we are going to 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.970
 go to text and then to animation 1 after 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:21.530
 to the range selector and here we are going to 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:23.150
 leave these 15 that are of good start 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.220
 here we are going to select this one here 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.800
 of the end and we are going to move it more or less 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.770
 if the space between 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.750
 one and the other is going to be longer on 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.610
 time of appearance of the letters if 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.020
 then if we do it closer it's going to be 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.330
 faster then I'm going to leave it 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.290
 more or less here a second and thousandths 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:44.230
 d 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.230
 not so much time and let's see how it is 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.200
 you see more goes faster I'm the best 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.620
 in fact I like it more than go more 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.969
 fast because 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.689
 according to how much writing speed 

00:02:55.969 --> 00:03:02.420
 have is what you want more or less 

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:05.330
 put we can put faster faster 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.790
 that everyone decides 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.460
 and good as they saw is quite simple 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.520
 nothing else is to do that and it can be done 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:15.950
 with up to one writing totally one 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.570
 large letter with all the letters that 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.210
 have way appearing according to 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.740
 time given in the age of birth 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:22.850
 Well, that was all for study 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.430
 and tutorial I hope you have them 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.800
 workable this has liked and if you 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.890
 liked from the little hand up subscribe 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:33.250
 comment and see you until next time 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.250
 goodbye
