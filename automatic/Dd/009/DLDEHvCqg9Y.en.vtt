November<00:00:15.919> 2012<00:00:17.240> which<00:00:18.240> would<00:00:19.199> make<00:00:19.409> it<00:00:19.529> about

thank<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:51.030> thanks<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.739> 4<00:00:52.739> MP<00:00:53.070> 60s<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.820> 2

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
thank you thanks to the 4 MP 60s and 2

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.669 
thank you thanks to the 4 MP 60s and 2
MP<00:00:54.660> 40<00:00:55.109> in<00:00:55.859> tank<00:00:56.190> pumps<00:00:56.609> and<00:00:56.960> so<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:58.320> never

00:00:58.669 --> 00:00:58.679 
MP 40 in tank pumps and so I never

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:00.200 
MP 40 in tank pumps and so I never
really<00:00:59.010> have<00:00:59.159> to<00:00:59.280> clean<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.730> bottom<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.149> the

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
really have to clean the bottom of the

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.930 
really have to clean the bottom of the
tank<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.899> little<00:01:01.170> bit<00:01:01.589> of<00:01:01.710> detritus<00:01:02.190> kind<00:01:02.850> of

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
tank a little bit of detritus kind of

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.640 
tank a little bit of detritus kind of
accumulates<00:01:03.449> maybe<00:01:03.659> at<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.019> back<00:01:04.199> left<00:01:04.440> and

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
accumulates maybe at the back left and

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.500 
accumulates maybe at the back left and
back<00:01:04.830> right<00:01:05.040> corners<00:01:05.550> and<00:01:05.730> that's<00:01:06.300> easily

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
back right corners and that's easily

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.540 
back right corners and that's easily
siphoned<00:01:07.110> out<00:01:07.200> but<00:01:07.440> the<00:01:07.530> tank<00:01:07.770> actually<00:01:08.040> stays

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550 
siphoned out but the tank actually stays

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.370 
siphoned out but the tank actually stays
quite<00:01:08.880> clean

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
quite clean

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.640 
quite clean
I<00:01:10.410> think<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.540> this<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:12.660> the<00:01:12.780> second<00:01:13.140> video<00:01:13.230> Joe

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
I think the this is the second video Joe

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.650 
I think the this is the second video Joe
has<00:01:13.830> taken<00:01:14.160> at<00:01:14.280> this<00:01:14.370> tank<00:01:14.640> for<00:01:14.880> me<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.270> the

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:15.660 
has taken at this tank for me and the

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.910 
has taken at this tank for me and the
first<00:01:15.870> video<00:01:16.730> I<00:01:17.730> had<00:01:18.540> radiant<00:01:19.320> lights<00:01:19.560> over

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
first video I had radiant lights over

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.860 
first video I had radiant lights over
the<00:01:20.010> tank<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.640> radians<00:01:21.030> are<00:01:21.210> decent

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:21.870 
the tank and the radians are decent

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.710 
the tank and the radians are decent
lights<00:01:22.080> but<00:01:22.410> I<00:01:22.440> think<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:22.860> they're<00:01:22.980> actually

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
lights but I think that they're actually

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.450 
lights but I think that they're actually
better<00:01:24.720> suited<00:01:25.080> towards<00:01:25.470> LPS<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:25.860> softies

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
better suited towards LPS and softies

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.600 
better suited towards LPS and softies
and<00:01:26.730> I<00:01:26.970> switched<00:01:27.330> about<00:01:28.100> five<00:01:29.100> months<00:01:29.310> ago

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
and I switched about five months ago

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.340 
and I switched about five months ago
back<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:30.030> metal<00:01:30.270> halides<00:01:30.660> so<00:01:30.930> right<00:01:31.140> now<00:01:31.320> I

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
back to metal halides so right now I

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.210 
back to metal halides so right now I
have<00:01:31.620> this<00:01:32.220> tank<00:01:32.490> is<00:01:32.640> lit<00:01:32.880> by<00:01:33.060> four<00:01:34.010> 400<00:01:35.010> watt

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
have this tank is lit by four 400 watt

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.660 
have this tank is lit by four 400 watt

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.429 
as Joe pans up there to the to the
reflectors<00:01:50.549> so<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:50.790> have<00:01:51.210> basically<00:01:51.509> I<00:01:51.930> had<00:01:52.229> one

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
reflectors so I have basically I had one

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.020 
reflectors so I have basically I had one
metal<00:01:52.710> halide<00:01:52.799> for<00:01:53.189> every<00:01:53.340> two<00:01:53.520> feet<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:53.820> tank

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
metal halide for every two feet of tank

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.670 
metal halide for every two feet of tank
length<00:01:54.299> it's<00:01:55.229> an<00:01:55.380> 8<00:01:55.500> foot<00:01:55.680> tank<00:01:56.149> and<00:01:57.149> I'm<00:01:58.110> quite

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
length it's an 8 foot tank and I'm quite

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.770 
length it's an 8 foot tank and I'm quite
happy<00:01:58.740> with<00:01:59.189> the<00:01:59.280> way<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.580> halide<00:02:00.119> said<00:02:00.450> they

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
happy with the way the halide said they

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.960 
happy with the way the halide said they
brought<00:02:01.020> out<00:02:01.229> colors<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:01.860> just<00:02:02.070> don't<00:02:02.729> believe

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
brought out colors I just don't believe

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.969 
brought out colors I just don't believe
that<00:02:03.030> right<00:02:03.689> now<00:02:03.720> that<00:02:04.110> LED<00:02:04.439> lights<00:02:04.710> are

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
that right now that LED lights are

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.089 
that right now that LED lights are
perfectly<00:02:05.729> suited<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.119> SPS<00:02:06.600> corals<00:02:06.630> son<00:02:07.289> I've

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
perfectly suited to SPS corals son I've

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.320 
perfectly suited to SPS corals son I've
found<00:02:08.429> that<00:02:09.019> the<00:02:10.019> sera<00:02:10.890> diaspora<00:02:11.400> aqua<00:02:12.000> forest

colors just aren't quite there yet I
really<00:03:07.739> think<00:03:07.950> that<00:03:08.010> kale<00:03:09.000> IDEs<00:03:09.209> provide<00:03:09.660> a

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
really think that kale IDEs provide a

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.699 
really think that kale IDEs provide a
better<00:03:10.650> overall<00:03:11.070> general<00:03:11.810> light<00:03:12.810> for<00:03:13.170> SPS<00:03:13.680> and

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
better overall general light for SPS and

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.960 
better overall general light for SPS and
SPS<00:03:14.250> coloration<00:03:14.940> versus<00:03:15.890> versus<00:03:16.890> LEDs<00:03:17.730> right

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
SPS coloration versus versus LEDs right

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.150 
SPS coloration versus versus LEDs right
now<00:03:18.209> but<00:03:18.600> that's<00:03:18.750> just<00:03:19.079> my<00:03:19.230> own<00:03:19.260> opinion<00:03:20.359> and

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
now but that's just my own opinion and

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.770 
now but that's just my own opinion and
I've<00:03:23.160> got<00:03:23.370> probably<00:03:23.760> in<00:03:24.209> the<00:03:24.359> tank<00:03:24.569> right<00:03:24.750> now
