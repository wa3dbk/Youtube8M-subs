00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
this thing in the store and then I was

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.800 
this thing in the store and then I was
like<00:00:15.929> what<00:00:16.770> happens<00:00:17.310> when<00:00:17.520> you<00:00:17.670> bite<00:00:18.000> right

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
like what happens when you bite right

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.800 
like what happens when you bite right
and<00:00:19.500> here<00:00:20.010> it<00:00:20.130> is<00:00:20.160> this<00:00:20.609> is<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:21.029> selector

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
and here it is this is the selector

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.880 
and here it is this is the selector
biometrics<00:00:22.910> 70<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.210> I<00:00:24.810> was<00:00:25.019> thinking<00:00:25.560> maybe

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
biometrics 70 and I was thinking maybe

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.640 
biometrics 70 and I was thinking maybe
we<00:00:26.160> should<00:00:26.369> get<00:00:26.849> like<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.539> whole<00:00:27.570> Buster<00:00:28.470> or

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
we should get like the whole Buster or

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.939 
we should get like the whole Buster or
maybe<00:00:28.859> black<00:00:29.670> widow<00:00:30.060> into<00:00:30.480> next<00:00:30.810> rank<00:00:31.710> or

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
maybe black widow into next rank or

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.049

unfortunately<00:00:46.760> we're<00:00:47.760> also<00:00:47.940> working<00:00:48.239> on

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
unfortunately we're also working on

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.529 
unfortunately we're also working on
Yellow<00:00:48.780> Jacket<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.469> also<00:00:50.280> like<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.969> Red<00:00:51.300> Hulk

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
Yellow Jacket I also like the Red Hulk

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.450 
Yellow Jacket I also like the Red Hulk
so<00:00:51.840> there's<00:00:52.050> so<00:00:52.350> much<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.710> select<00:00:53.280> from

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
so there's so much to select from

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.299 
so there's so much to select from
unfortunately<00:00:54.270> it<00:00:55.260> might<00:00:55.469> take<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.739> while<00:00:55.980> and

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
unfortunately it might take a while and

what I'm thinking is maybe we should
just<00:00:58.920> get<00:00:59.100> one<00:00:59.460> for<00:00:59.760> now<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.390> we're<00:01:01.170> gonna<00:01:01.260> do

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.150 

this<00:05:39.540> week<00:05:39.870> this<00:05:40.140> is<00:05:40.200> so<00:05:40.560> weird<00:05:40.830> it<00:05:40.980> doesn't

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.160 
this week this is so weird it doesn't

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.800 
this week this is so weird it doesn't
make<00:05:41.430> sense<00:05:41.760> if<00:05:41.940> you're<00:05:42.210> somewhere<00:05:42.690> around

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810 
make sense if you're somewhere around

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.320 
make sense if you're somewhere around
there<00:05:43.200> and<00:05:43.770> you're<00:05:43.950> looking<00:05:44.100> at<00:05:44.400> this<00:05:44.670> because

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:45.330 
there and you're looking at this because

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.500 
there and you're looking at this because
I'm<00:05:45.510> kind<00:05:45.870> of<00:05:45.990> I<00:05:46.290> don't<00:05:47.280> know<00:05:47.430> I'm<00:05:47.610> lost<00:05:47.820> I'm

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:48.510 
I'm kind of I don't know I'm lost I'm

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:51.680 
I'm kind of I don't know I'm lost I'm
lost<00:05:48.990> for<00:05:49.290> words<00:05:49.500> maybe<00:05:50.150> it<00:05:51.150> doesn't<00:05:51.570> make

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
lost for words maybe it doesn't make

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.140 
lost for words maybe it doesn't make
sense<00:05:51.720> right<00:05:52.260> about<00:05:52.440> now<00:05:52.560> because<00:05:53.000> you<00:05:54.000> get

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
sense right about now because you get

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.000 
sense right about now because you get
five<00:05:54.390> chests<00:05:54.750> for<00:05:54.900> four<00:05:55.080> thousand<00:05:55.590> crystals

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.010 
five chests for four thousand crystals

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.130 
five chests for four thousand crystals
and<00:05:56.220> you<00:05:56.280> can<00:05:56.550> get<00:05:56.730> ten<00:05:57.480> chests

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:58.140 
and you can get ten chests

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.260 
and you can get ten chests
well<00:05:58.710> I<00:05:58.740> guess<00:05:58.950> the<00:05:59.100> other<00:05:59.130> one<00:05:59.430> is<00:05:59.610> a<00:05:59.640> hero

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270 
well I guess the other one is a hero

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.410 
well I guess the other one is a hero
chest<00:06:01.280> times<00:06:02.280> five<00:06:02.580> but<00:06:02.850> this<00:06:02.970> one<00:06:03.150> guarantee

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:03.420 
chest times five but this one guarantee

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.710 
chest times five but this one guarantee
one<00:06:03.930> hero<00:06:04.200> guaranteed<00:06:05.390> doesn't<00:06:06.390> make<00:06:06.480> sense

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 
one hero guaranteed doesn't make sense

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:15.800 
one hero guaranteed doesn't make sense
to<00:06:07.350> me<00:06:07.500> a<00:06:07.740> bit<00:06:09.500> yeah<00:06:11.240> I<00:06:12.240> don't<00:06:12.360> know<00:06:14.630> I'm<00:06:15.630> gonna
