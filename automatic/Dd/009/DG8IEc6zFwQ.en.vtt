 especially j stick marester criticize this 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.590
 that it was necessary to leave on it and not a 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.360
 first name 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.210
 nothing planned no thinking 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.810
 so we had left the lot of the great 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.280
 belgium price 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.050

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.880
 August oyster park did a little bit of 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.710
 physics bike beautiful physics i 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.260
 never stopped after I took some 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.360
 holiday a new coat because 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.180

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.010
 the stop with us which it rained 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.740
 another another motorcycle so I 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.480
 bought one when 53 at florida 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:05.630
 and here I am trained on his handlebars 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:07.010
 for a good month and participate in a 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.170
 little finding last week in four 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.180
 five years I'm happy 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.260
 and here she was I waiting to know 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.490
 what I was going to do in the 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.880
 next few weeks will result in a 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.070
 super post still other things and 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.420
 feel that blurred so washed it gave me 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.130
 the opportunity to know what I 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.540
 were doing for the next month then you 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.130
 will land at the grand prix with just one 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.600
 little bit of running there it is friday 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.560
 after said to test the bike it'll be 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.270
 enough water in the weekend it's true 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.530
 it feels a little light that I 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.920
 am proud I went so fast that the 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.120
 mounts today 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.380
 it went well after you find yourself 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:43.020
 the sensations of saint denis 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.670
 it should do it we remember 2008 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.110
 the kawa you knew the championship 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.479
 europe 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.830
 it's going to be not complicated you're going to 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.970
 ride this weekend open to a motorcycle on 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.399
 knows that she is capable of winning 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.350
 gp you hear it you got to roll in 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.670
 top level in your head what are you 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.689
 hopes of this grand prize and the great 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.850
 price of germany son yann to two when 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.429
 same wedge and will propose so it's for 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.080
 that the first one there was a lot of 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:05.820
 new timing scheme serve for 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.860
 progress throughout the weekend on 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.229
 will please because it is 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.530
 he had dreamed forever so that will be 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.700
 priority after this goal and come 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.050
 then two big prizes to revive 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.180
 maybe in cross we could hear everywhere 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.710
 enduro but we can imagine that the 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.720
 cross it stays that's the passion is 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.640
 what your envy ben here it is true 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.140
 that it can also serve as 30 and for 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.370
 maybe something for the year 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.840
 next it's true that I was a 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.220
 black line of points to programs 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.440
 completely different for the year 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.150
 next it's to make a season 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.780
 elite with great posts us to 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.480
 stay in France 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.819
 we will leave an office so 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.230
 without giving the opportunity to make gp 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.000
 in our good conditions and see this 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.620
 that I can do under these conditions there 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.540
 good faiza it's still going to be better 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.920
 start in order to axis had been to the irpp 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.330
 last week no yeah that's right 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.830
 that it would have been more complicated but 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.150
 I even know if I would be the revenue 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.379
 eve I made sand without 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.610
 drive I think that that would have 

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:55.560
 could not be done so that's why 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.209
 it falls well there whatsoever in 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.430
 conditions that looks like the field 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.019
 French and bat loïc we wish full 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.500
 good things you need it 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.090
 the merits 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.340
 we remember the last podium it was at 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.360
 eradicated in 2009 you had proved this 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.769
 year there who had way to do 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.420
 something we imagine that these 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.829
 sensations there you dream of the air 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.140
 live even though it may be a small 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:14.519
 little early for this very exactly it's 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.920
 true that we find ourselves in sharp rise 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.269
 after that I'm in a structure 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.530
 even better because I was in 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:20.770
 2009 or equivalent 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.750
 after 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.070
 good it's true a few moments when I 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.990
 go or go ahead on loan so I 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.910
 think to have no illusions 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:30.790
 aim too high entrance but why 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.570
 not to make good pictures that 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.760
 that's all the harm he wants 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.250
 so to change everything there is a 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.480
 second pilot who starts on a kawa 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.270
 pro circuit 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.880
 it's past Santa Claus is past 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.380
 before the hour well yah it's a great 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.890
 luck for me so I hope the 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.360
 grab and then here I am riding from this 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.730
 mansion to practice trying a 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.900
 coat it went really well I 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:55.420
 really feel good with it's 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.300
 completely different from 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.980
 pictures that I had so it's great 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:04.420
 I hope 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.709
 and then I said at once to loïc 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.670
 the bike she had proved she 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.470
 could win great prizes that one 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.730
 she proved she could win 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.470
 sleeves of europe have not done too much 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.480
 pressure anyway no question 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.519
 I have not you / vis-à-vis all 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.699
 lots of the team so that's it's great 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:20.470
 and that's how I did as I did 

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:23.470
 said and that we rehash and for me 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.510
 it's the perfect bike so I hope 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.400
 obviously serve and why not do 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:28.690
 a podium here it would be good my 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.160
 advantage is that you arrived with a little 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.660
 rolling road carpet and it's this 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.020
 motorcycle but that's even though it's been pretty 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.360
 short 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.950
 yes I tried the bike the linked to ben 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.960
 ali on the inside of ben ali and that 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.000
 went really well we feel everything from 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.040
 then at ease on and then we have 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.960
 tweaked the settings did work a 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.259
 little 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:49.889
 with bono on the guide in settings and 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:51.870
 then here is the bike mocking well I 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:52.530
 sleep well a week bah yeah I 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.180
 am a little excited 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:57.090
 I am expecting the same for them 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.349
 roll with and then we set ourselves two 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.110
 objectives in the corner of the head 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:03.510
 yeah for me yes podium that would be good 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.930
 I hope to leave for 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:08.340
 arrived at 10am is a way of getting 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.870
 maybe revive these two gp that's going 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.220
 do what it was not with the bike 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.440
 it may also be an opportunity to 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.550
 take off to find a good bond 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.060
 handlebars a good condition for the 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.130
 next season 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:20.070
 yeah I hope so I hope 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.350
 from 20 and show that I know well 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.810
 rolled 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.460
 here I can be in front I have a 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:27.710
 good speed with a good bike is ok 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.230
 very good for me so here I hope 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:33.070
 good to leave and 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:34.420
 and who better than the Spis Ben Listens 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.190
 that's all the harm we want and then 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:39.690
 you are told to both of you hi 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.690
 see you tomorrow and see you soon
