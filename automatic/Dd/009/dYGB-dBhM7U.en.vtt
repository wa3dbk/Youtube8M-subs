00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.540 
either but there's something in it that
my<00:03:49.240> skin<00:03:49.480> tone<00:03:49.660> doesn't<00:03:49.930> like<00:03:50.230> obviously<00:03:51.190> this

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:51.550 
my skin tone doesn't like obviously this

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.030 
my skin tone doesn't like obviously this
is<00:03:51.760> unlikely<00:03:52.450> to<00:03:52.630> happen<00:03:52.780> to<00:03:53.140> you<00:03:53.320> do<00:03:53.620> to<00:03:53.800> your

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
is unlikely to happen to you do to your

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.830 
is unlikely to happen to you do to your
skin<00:03:54.100> tone<00:03:54.430> so<00:03:54.670> probably<00:03:55.030> your<00:03:55.330> skin<00:03:55.570> probably

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
skin tone so probably your skin probably

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.570 
skin tone so probably your skin probably
better<00:03:56.140> than<00:03:56.320> mine<00:03:56.500> but<00:03:56.680> unfortunately<00:03:57.400> I've

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
better than mine but unfortunately I've

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:58.800 
better than mine but unfortunately I've
had<00:03:57.610> a<00:03:57.820> bad<00:03:58.060> reaction<00:03:58.240> to<00:03:58.570> it

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
had a bad reaction to it

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.560 
had a bad reaction to it
I<00:03:59.020> thought<00:03:59.890> 14<00:04:00.370> perhaps<00:04:00.640> a<00:04:00.790> reasonable<00:04:01.360> price

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570 
I thought 14 perhaps a reasonable price

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.170 
I thought 14 perhaps a reasonable price
for<00:04:01.870> this<00:04:02.050> foundation<00:04:02.950> because<00:04:03.250> it<00:04:03.400> does<00:04:03.940> work

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
for this foundation because it does work

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.090 
for this foundation because it does work
well<00:04:04.360> and<00:04:04.630> they<00:04:04.840> have<00:04:05.050> worked<00:04:05.290> hard<00:04:05.530> to<00:04:05.620> find<00:04:05.890> a

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
well and they have worked hard to find a

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.280 
well and they have worked hard to find a
skin<00:04:06.700> tone<00:04:06.880> that<00:04:07.060> suits<00:04:07.330> everybody<00:04:07.660> and<00:04:08.110> it's

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
skin tone that suits everybody and it's

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.770 
skin tone that suits everybody and it's
been<00:04:08.680> perfect<00:04:09.100> for<00:04:09.220> me<00:04:09.400> I'm<00:04:10.060> lighter<00:04:10.480> than

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
been perfect for me I'm lighter than

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.600 
been perfect for me I'm lighter than
light<00:04:10.960> and<00:04:11.320> there<00:04:11.980> was<00:04:12.070> a<00:04:12.100> foundation<00:04:12.580> that

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
light and there was a foundation that

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.580 
light and there was a foundation that
was<00:04:12.970> suitable<00:04:13.300> for<00:04:13.540> me<00:04:13.780> where<00:04:14.050> before<00:04:14.230> it

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
was suitable for me where before it

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.440 
was suitable for me where before it
would<00:04:14.740> have<00:04:14.830> been<00:04:14.920> too<00:04:15.100> yellow<00:04:15.490> to<00:04:15.520> Orange<00:04:16.270> II

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:16.450 
would have been too yellow to Orange II

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.810 
would have been too yellow to Orange II
and<00:04:16.870> wouldn't<00:04:17.650> be<00:04:17.770> great<00:04:17.920> but<00:04:18.220> that<00:04:18.400> was

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
and wouldn't be great but that was

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.840 
and wouldn't be great but that was
absolutely<00:04:19.150> perfect<00:04:19.299> but<00:04:20.220> hey<00:04:21.220> what<00:04:21.460> can<00:04:21.730> you

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
absolutely perfect but hey what can you

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:22.260

do

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 
do

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.780 
do
so<00:04:23.110> that's<00:04:23.710> my<00:04:24.010> review

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
so that's my review

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:26.850 
so that's my review

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
and I would advise you to go out and try

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.100

it<00:04:26.920> out<00:04:27.130> if<00:04:27.400> his<00:04:27.580> skin<00:04:27.670> isn't<00:04:28.150> very<00:04:28.540> sensitive

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
it out if his skin isn't very sensitive

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.160 
it out if his skin isn't very sensitive
