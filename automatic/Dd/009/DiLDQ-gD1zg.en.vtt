00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
has certainly been the most complex in

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.560 
has certainly been the most complex in
terms<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.400> organization<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.150> planning

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
but actually the most productive as well

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.340 
but actually the most productive as well
in<00:01:32.640> terms<00:01:32.760> of<00:01:32.940> the<00:01:33.000> outcomes<00:01:33.390> we've<00:01:33.600> got<00:01:33.810> when

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.420 
it's certainly been challenging to my

school<00:03:44.819> so<00:03:45.150> there<00:03:45.389> there's<00:03:46.109> other<00:03:46.440> people<00:03:46.739> who

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
school so there there's other people who

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.620 
school so there there's other people who
can<00:03:46.950> go<00:03:47.069> there<00:03:47.280> under<00:03:47.639> the<00:03:47.760> same<00:03:47.910> thing<00:03:48.120> the

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
can go there under the same thing the

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:49.849 
can go there under the same thing the
outcomes<00:03:49.139> in<00:03:49.349> terms<00:03:49.380> of<00:03:49.709> performance

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
outcomes in terms of performance

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:53.080 
outcomes in terms of performance
certainly<00:03:50.849> would<00:03:51.030> be<00:03:51.590> raised<00:03:52.590> in<00:03:52.739> attainment

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
certainly would be raised in attainment

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.360 
certainly would be raised in attainment
within<00:03:54.090> both<00:03:54.239> schools<00:03:54.599> and<00:03:55.560> importantly

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
within both schools and importantly

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.009 
within both schools and importantly
actually<00:03:56.549> raised<00:03:56.849> in<00:03:56.970> attainment<00:03:57.239> faster

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
actually raised in attainment faster

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.120 
actually raised in attainment faster
than<00:03:58.200> we<00:03:58.290> might<00:03:58.500> have<00:03:58.560> done<00:03:58.829> if<00:03:58.980> we've<00:03:59.099> been

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
than we might have done if we've been

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.819 
than we might have done if we've been
working<00:03:59.760> and<00:03:59.940> left<00:04:00.480> to<00:04:00.630> our<00:04:00.750> own<00:04:00.780> devices<00:04:00.900> I

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
working and left to our own devices I

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:03.140 
working and left to our own devices I
think<00:04:02.010> it's<00:04:02.370> a<00:04:02.400> good<00:04:02.549> thing<00:04:02.730> I've<00:04:02.880> had<00:04:03.030> the

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
think it's a good thing I've had the

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:04.759 
think it's a good thing I've had the

opportunity to apply for catified

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:06.050 
opportunity to apply for catified
because<00:04:04.980> there's<00:04:05.190> definitely<00:04:05.579> opened<00:04:05.849> a<00:04:05.910> lot

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
because there's definitely opened a lot

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.270 
because there's definitely opened a lot
of<00:04:06.180> doors<00:04:06.269> for<00:04:06.720> us<00:04:06.810> for<00:04:07.169> our<00:04:07.230> futures<00:04:07.680> and<00:04:07.889> it's

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
of doors for us for our futures and it's

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.650

I<00:04:10.670> think<00:04:11.420> it's<00:04:11.570> a<00:04:11.600> good<00:04:11.720> idea<00:04:11.870> partner<00:04:12.440> and

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
I think it's a good idea partner and

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:13.810 
I think it's a good idea partner and
we've<00:04:12.770> had<00:04:12.920> to<00:04:13.040> hire<00:04:13.190> the<00:04:13.400> pairs<00:04:13.610> they're

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
to do what yeah I think it is good

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.190 
to do what yeah I think it is good
because<00:04:18.410> they're<00:04:18.709> bonding<00:04:19.130> and<00:04:19.450> when<00:04:20.450> they<00:04:20.660> do

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
that like you could get some good ideas

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:24.970 
that like you could get some good ideas
flowing<00:04:23.060> between<00:04:23.480> schools<00:04:23.840> not<00:04:24.200> just<00:04:24.560> one<00:04:24.770> to

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:24.980

tough<00:05:00.140> not<00:05:00.290> bad<00:05:00.470> to<00:05:00.650> say<00:05:00.830> but<00:05:00.860> it's<00:05:01.400> improved

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060
