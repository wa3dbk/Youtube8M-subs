I'm<00:00:44.170> actually<00:00:44.320> using<00:00:44.620> previous<00:00:45.280> footage<00:00:45.550> from

necessary<00:00:52.149> for<00:00:52.569> me<00:00:52.629> to<00:00:52.719> reuse<00:00:53.079> it<00:00:53.260> because<00:00:53.710> I

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
necessary for me to reuse it because I

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.459 
necessary for me to reuse it because I
need<00:00:54.819> to<00:00:54.940> illustrate<00:00:55.329> the<00:00:55.420> point<00:00:55.659> so<00:00:56.140> that

current system is going to be removed

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.450 
current system is going to be removed
and<00:01:28.450> you<00:01:28.990> also<00:01:29.170> put<00:01:29.439> on<00:01:29.560> top<00:01:29.710> of<00:01:29.860> the<00:01:29.950> argument

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
and you also put on top of the argument

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.940

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829 
the game and it adds more to set

the game and it adds more to set
argument<00:01:36.399> that<00:01:36.670> our<00:01:37.000> current<00:01:37.180> system<00:01:37.450> is

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
argument that our current system is

free things away so rather than stacking
up<00:01:48.579> both<00:01:49.149> systems<00:01:49.689> it<00:01:49.960> looks<00:01:50.170> like<00:01:50.289> they're

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:50.439 
up both systems it looks like they're

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:51.810 
up both systems it looks like they're

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
new one is a method of monetization so

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.969 
new one is a method of monetization so
it's<00:01:57.219> a<00:01:57.340> big<00:01:57.520> win<00:01:57.729> win<00:01:57.939> for<00:01:58.210> gaijin<00:01:59.109> it's

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
it's a big win win for gaijin it's

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:01.919 
it's a big win win for gaijin it's
monetized<00:02:00.549> because<00:02:01.060> you<00:02:01.240> can<00:02:01.390> actually<00:02:01.539> buy

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:01.929 
monetized because you can actually buy

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:05.340 
monetized because you can actually buy
boost<00:02:02.350> for<00:02:03.340> Golden<00:02:03.999> Eagles<00:02:04.390> and<00:02:04.630> also<00:02:05.140> with

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
boost for Golden Eagles and also with

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.700 
boost for Golden Eagles and also with
battle<00:02:05.710> trophies<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:07.420> can<00:02:07.600> also<00:02:07.780> get<00:02:08.320> random

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
battle trophies you can also get random

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.390 
battle trophies you can also get random
chances<00:02:09.160> of<00:02:09.479> getting<00:02:10.479> boosts<00:02:10.810> out<00:02:10.899> of<00:02:11.110> them

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
chances of getting boosts out of them

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.500 
chances of getting boosts out of them
but<00:02:12.400> of<00:02:12.520> course<00:02:12.550> you<00:02:12.820> have<00:02:13.030> to<00:02:13.060> buy<00:02:13.270> power

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
but of course you have to buy power

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.839 
but of course you have to buy power
trophies<00:02:14.020> with<00:02:14.200> golden<00:02:14.530> eagles<00:02:14.890> so<00:02:15.550> golden

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
trophies with golden eagles so golden

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.750 
trophies with golden eagles so golden
eagles<00:02:16.209> equals<00:02:16.900> money<00:02:17.080> that's<00:02:18.040> monetization

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
eagles equals money that's monetization

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.210 
eagles equals money that's monetization
it<00:02:19.180> makes<00:02:19.629> sense<00:02:19.780> what<00:02:20.019> they've<00:02:20.230> done<00:02:20.440> I

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
it makes sense what they've done I

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.340 
it makes sense what they've done I
ever<00:02:21.340> they've<00:02:22.000> been<00:02:22.330> very<00:02:22.570> silent<00:02:23.110> about<00:02:23.290> it

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
ever they've been very silent about it

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:24.810 
ever they've been very silent about it
and<00:02:23.680> this<00:02:23.950> is<00:02:24.100> kind<00:02:24.250> of<00:02:24.310> a<00:02:24.400> bit<00:02:24.520> of<00:02:24.610> speculation

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
and this is kind of a bit of speculation

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.910 
and this is kind of a bit of speculation
maybe<00:02:25.450> they<00:02:25.660> won't<00:02:25.840> do<00:02:26.050> it<00:02:26.200> it<00:02:26.560> just<00:02:26.740> seems

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
maybe they won't do it it just seems

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.380 
maybe they won't do it it just seems
like<00:02:27.010> given<00:02:27.520> the<00:02:27.550> arguments<00:02:28.150> I've<00:02:28.240> already

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
like given the arguments I've already

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.930 
like given the arguments I've already
presented<00:02:29.050> it<00:02:29.200> seems<00:02:29.530> kind<00:02:29.830> of<00:02:29.920> likely<00:02:30.370> that

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
presented it seems kind of likely that

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.540 
presented it seems kind of likely that
this<00:02:31.120> is<00:02:31.330> going<00:02:31.510> to<00:02:31.630> happen<00:02:32.100> now<00:02:33.100> there's<00:02:33.490> a

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
this is going to happen now there's a

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.460 
this is going to happen now there's a
few<00:02:33.760> things<00:02:33.940> that<00:02:34.180> this<00:02:34.660> can<00:02:34.900> actually<00:02:35.050> mean

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
few things that this can actually mean

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.500 
few things that this can actually mean
for<00:02:35.770> the<00:02:35.830> players<00:02:36.100> firstly<00:02:36.700> is<00:02:36.910> this<00:02:37.180> a<00:02:37.210> good

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
for the players firstly is this a good

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.120 
for the players firstly is this a good
change<00:02:37.780> where<00:02:38.080> is<00:02:38.140> this<00:02:38.200> a<00:02:38.260> bad<00:02:38.470> change<00:02:38.830> I<00:02:39.070> know

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
change where is this a bad change I know

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.830 
change where is this a bad change I know
a<00:02:39.280> lot<00:02:39.610> of<00:02:39.640> you<00:02:39.880> are<00:02:40.060> going<00:02:40.270> to<00:02:40.330> be<00:02:40.390> up<00:02:40.540> in<00:02:40.720> arms

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
a lot of you are going to be up in arms

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.080 
a lot of you are going to be up in arms
about<00:02:41.080> this<00:02:41.410> straightaway<00:02:41.800> however<00:02:42.700> let's

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
about this straightaway however let's

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.750 
about this straightaway however let's
talk<00:02:43.900> about<00:02:44.080> it<00:02:44.320> reasonably<00:02:44.740> first<00:02:45.100> I'm

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
talk about it reasonably first I'm

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.250 
talk about it reasonably first I'm
actually<00:02:46.030> quite<00:02:46.240> neutral<00:02:46.690> about<00:02:46.900> this<00:02:47.080> change

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
actually quite neutral about this change

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.890 
actually quite neutral about this change
I'm<00:02:47.590> kind<00:02:48.520> of<00:02:48.580> on<00:02:48.760> the<00:02:48.790> fence<00:02:49.060> I<00:02:49.390> think<00:02:49.750> there's

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
I'm kind of on the fence I think there's

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.650 
I'm kind of on the fence I think there's
pros<00:02:50.110> and<00:02:50.140> cons<00:02:50.470> to<00:02:50.590> both<00:02:51.030> firstly<00:02:52.030> I<00:02:52.240> have<00:02:52.570> to

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
pros and cons to both firstly I have to

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.600 
pros and cons to both firstly I have to
say<00:02:52.840> that<00:02:52.870> over<00:02:53.260> the<00:02:53.350> long<00:02:53.530> term<00:02:53.590> I<00:02:54.100> believe

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
say that over the long term I believe

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:55.800 
say that over the long term I believe
that<00:02:54.850> the<00:02:54.940> current<00:02:55.240> system<00:02:55.390> that<00:02:55.660> we're

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
that the current system that we're

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.680 
that the current system that we're
working<00:02:55.959> with<00:02:56.290> having<00:02:56.950> two<00:02:57.100> times<00:02:57.340> XP<00:02:57.910> on<00:02:58.150> each

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
working with having two times XP on each

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.270 
working with having two times XP on each
nation<00:02:59.140> for<00:02:59.320> the<00:02:59.380> first<00:02:59.560> victory<00:02:59.890> each<00:03:00.070> day

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
nation for the first victory each day

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.090 
nation for the first victory each day
would<00:03:00.940> actually<00:03:01.120> make<00:03:01.450> the<00:03:01.630> game<00:03:02.320> less<00:03:02.560> grindy

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
would actually make the game less grindy

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.820 
would actually make the game less grindy
over<00:03:03.550> a<00:03:03.580> long<00:03:03.940> period<00:03:03.990> but<00:03:04.990> now<00:03:05.110> also<00:03:05.320> consider

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
over a long period but now also consider

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.940 
over a long period but now also consider
this<00:03:06.630> with<00:03:07.630> these<00:03:07.810> boosts<00:03:08.320> they<00:03:08.770> have

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
this with these boosts they have

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.640 
this with these boosts they have
different<00:03:09.280> they're<00:03:10.150> more<00:03:10.390> flexible<00:03:10.959> first

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
different they're more flexible first

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.830 
different they're more flexible first
thing<00:03:11.770> you<00:03:11.950> can<00:03:11.980> use<00:03:12.220> them<00:03:12.400> as<00:03:12.840> research

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
thing you can use them as research

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.470 
thing you can use them as research
booths<00:03:14.170> or<00:03:14.530> you<00:03:15.190> can<00:03:15.400> use<00:03:15.430> them<00:03:15.790> as<00:03:15.910> lying

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
booths or you can use them as lying

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.440 
booths or you can use them as lying
boosts<00:03:17.050> now<00:03:17.830> they<00:03:18.040> can<00:03:18.220> also<00:03:18.340> vary<00:03:18.670> depending

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
boosts now they can also vary depending

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.470 
boosts now they can also vary depending
on how<00:03:19.930> much<00:03:20.350> they<00:03:20.800> can<00:03:20.860> boost<00:03:21.280> up<00:03:21.580> whatever

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
on how much they can boost up whatever

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.810 
on how much they can boost up whatever
research<00:03:22.990> or<00:03:23.290> lines<00:03:23.530> that<00:03:23.800> you<00:03:23.830> want<00:03:24.130> they<00:03:24.670> can

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
research or lines that you want they can

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.820 
research or lines that you want they can
go<00:03:24.940> between<00:03:25.120> ten<00:03:25.690> percent<00:03:26.080> all<00:03:26.320> the<00:03:26.590> way<00:03:26.680> up<00:03:26.800> to

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
go between ten percent all the way up to

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.610 
go between ten percent all the way up to
i<00:03:27.040> believe<00:03:27.310> five<00:03:27.910> hundred<00:03:28.360> percent<00:03:28.750> now<00:03:29.560> you

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
i believe five hundred percent now you

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.140 
i believe five hundred percent now you
can<00:03:29.860> imagine<00:03:30.070> if<00:03:30.400> you<00:03:30.489> had<00:03:30.519> five<00:03:30.850> hundred

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
can imagine if you had five hundred

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.880 
can imagine if you had five hundred
percent<00:03:31.480> that<00:03:31.930> would<00:03:32.050> be<00:03:32.110> pretty<00:03:32.260> awesome<00:03:32.380> and

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
percent that would be pretty awesome and

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.100 
percent that would be pretty awesome and
also<00:03:33.580> another<00:03:33.940> thing<00:03:34.060> to<00:03:34.300> consider<00:03:34.420> is<00:03:34.870> the

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
also another thing to consider is the

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.990 
also another thing to consider is the
fact<00:03:35.470> that<00:03:35.620> these<00:03:35.890> booths<00:03:36.190> can<00:03:36.430> last<00:03:36.670> either

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
fact that these booths can last either

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.810 
fact that these booths can last either
one<00:03:37.420> game<00:03:37.660> or<00:03:37.930> even<00:03:38.200> multiple<00:03:38.890> games<00:03:39.190> now<00:03:39.790> I

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
one game or even multiple games now I

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.520 
one game or even multiple games now I
don't<00:03:39.970> know<00:03:40.209> exactly<00:03:40.690> how<00:03:40.900> many<00:03:40.959> multiple

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
don't know exactly how many multiple

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.350 
don't know exactly how many multiple
games<00:03:41.739> that<00:03:41.920> can<00:03:41.980> go<00:03:42.100> up<00:03:42.130> to<00:03:42.489> but<00:03:43.030> if<00:03:43.120> you<00:03:43.209> can

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
games that can go up to but if you can

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.240 
games that can go up to but if you can
imagine<00:03:43.450> having<00:03:43.900> like<00:03:44.320> a<00:03:44.350> five<00:03:44.620> hundred<00:03:44.830> times

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
imagine having like a five hundred times

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.880 
imagine having like a five hundred times
or<00:03:45.550> five<00:03:46.090> hundred<00:03:46.480> percent<00:03:46.810> boost<00:03:47.080> over

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
or five hundred percent boost over

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.550 
or five hundred percent boost over
multiple<00:03:48.310> games<00:03:48.580> my<00:03:49.420> god<00:03:49.660> that<00:03:50.380> would<00:03:50.500> be

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
multiple games my god that would be

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.440 
multiple games my god that would be
pretty<00:03:50.680> damn<00:03:50.950> awesome<00:03:51.130> but<00:03:51.850> chances<00:03:52.239> aren't

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
pretty damn awesome but chances aren't

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.180 
pretty damn awesome but chances aren't
getting<00:03:52.870> something<00:03:53.049> like<00:03:53.260> that<00:03:53.410> would<00:03:53.560> be

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
getting something like that would be

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.150 
getting something like that would be
kind<00:03:55.060> of<00:03:55.209> rare<00:03:55.680> likewise<00:03:56.680> you<00:03:56.709> could<00:03:57.010> get

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
kind of rare likewise you could get

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.800 
kind of rare likewise you could get
something<00:03:57.340> on<00:03:57.519> the<00:03:57.640> lower<00:03:57.820> end<00:03:57.940> scale<00:03:58.420> like

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
something on the lower end scale like

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.020 
something on the lower end scale like
ten<00:03:59.110> percent<00:03:59.500> and<00:03:59.769> that<00:04:00.489> wouldn't<00:04:00.730> give<00:04:00.940> you

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
ten percent and that wouldn't give you

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.930 
ten percent and that wouldn't give you
much<00:04:01.239> of<00:04:01.269> a<00:04:01.450> boost<00:04:01.600> at<00:04:01.900> all<00:04:02.220> so<00:04:03.220> you<00:04:03.640> can<00:04:03.790> really

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
much of a boost at all so you can really

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.520 
much of a boost at all so you can really
see<00:04:04.180> that<00:04:04.390> there's<00:04:04.600> pros<00:04:04.930> and<00:04:04.959> cons<00:04:05.290> to<00:04:05.440> each

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
see that there's pros and cons to each

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.100 
see that there's pros and cons to each
of<00:04:05.830> these<00:04:05.920> systems<00:04:06.209> however<00:04:07.209> I<00:04:07.540> think<00:04:07.930> it's

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
of these systems however I think it's

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.740 
of these systems however I think it's
likely<00:04:08.410> that<00:04:08.650> for<00:04:09.070> the<00:04:09.160> average<00:04:09.310> player<00:04:09.910> over

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
likely that for the average player over

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.050 
likely that for the average player over
the<00:04:11.049> course<00:04:11.320> of<00:04:11.530> their<00:04:11.980> career<00:04:12.489> in<00:04:12.640> this<00:04:12.820> game

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
the course of their career in this game

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.690 
the course of their career in this game
they're<00:04:13.989> likely<00:04:14.530> to<00:04:14.560> have<00:04:14.920> a<00:04:15.100> more<00:04:15.340> grinding

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
they're likely to have a more grinding

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.030 
they're likely to have a more grinding
experience<00:04:16.660> although<00:04:16.959> you<00:04:17.200> won't<00:04:17.440> feel<00:04:17.739> it<00:04:17.919> in

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
experience although you won't feel it in

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.820 
experience although you won't feel it in
the<00:04:18.280> short<00:04:18.519> term<00:04:18.729> over<00:04:19.690> the<00:04:19.780> long<00:04:19.989> term<00:04:20.019> there

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:20.830 
the short term over the long term there

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:22.770 
the short term over the long term there
might<00:04:21.100> be<00:04:21.130> a<00:04:21.430> bit<00:04:21.669> of<00:04:21.760> an<00:04:21.880> impact<00:04:22.270> where<00:04:22.660> you're

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
might be a bit of an impact where you're

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.170 
might be a bit of an impact where you're
not<00:04:22.930> actually<00:04:23.250> grinding<00:04:24.250> up<00:04:24.400> as<00:04:24.580> fast<00:04:24.880> as<00:04:25.150> you

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
not actually grinding up as fast as you

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.780 
not actually grinding up as fast as you
were<00:04:25.390> previous<00:04:25.840> now<00:04:26.050> it's<00:04:27.010> not<00:04:27.220> necessarily<00:04:27.760> a

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 
were previous now it's not necessarily a

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:29.700 
were previous now it's not necessarily a
bad<00:04:28.030> thing<00:04:28.090> because<00:04:28.660> I<00:04:29.020> think<00:04:29.320> for<00:04:29.470> a<00:04:29.500> lot<00:04:29.650> of

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
bad thing because I think for a lot of

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.050 
bad thing because I think for a lot of
players<00:04:30.010> especially<00:04:30.370> when<00:04:30.729> you're<00:04:30.849> new<00:04:30.970> or

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
players especially when you're new or

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.230 
players especially when you're new or
two

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
two

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.330 
two
the<00:04:31.300> game<00:04:31.479> and<00:04:31.870> even<00:04:32.740> if<00:04:32.830> you've<00:04:32.949> been<00:04:33.039> playing

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
the game and even if you've been playing

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.180 
the game and even if you've been playing
for<00:04:33.639> a<00:04:33.669> while<00:04:33.759> not<00:04:34.720> as<00:04:34.960> much<00:04:35.319> as<00:04:35.380> I<00:04:35.680> have<00:04:35.889> if

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
for a while not as much as I have if

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:37.650 
for a while not as much as I have if
you've<00:04:36.610> been<00:04:36.759> still<00:04:37.030> been<00:04:37.210> playing<00:04:37.449> for<00:04:37.630> a

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
you've been still been playing for a

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.529 
you've been still been playing for a
while<00:04:37.720> what<00:04:38.590> you'll<00:04:38.710> notice<00:04:38.740> is<00:04:39.190> that<00:04:39.250> a<00:04:39.610> lot

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:40.539 
while what you'll notice is that a lot

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:41.909 
while what you'll notice is that a lot
of<00:04:40.660> times<00:04:40.840> you're<00:04:40.990> kind<00:04:41.199> of<00:04:41.229> lacking<00:04:41.530> with

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
of times you're kind of lacking with

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:44.189 
of times you're kind of lacking with
lions<00:04:42.370> as<00:04:42.550> in<00:04:42.819> you'll<00:04:42.970> unlock<00:04:43.419> things<00:04:43.720> before

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:44.199 
lions as in you'll unlock things before

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:46.290 
lions as in you'll unlock things before
you're<00:04:44.319> able<00:04:44.440> to<00:04:44.680> purchase<00:04:44.889> them<00:04:45.250> so<00:04:45.970> by

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
you're able to purchase them so by

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.330 
you're able to purchase them so by
making<00:04:46.509> the<00:04:46.840> game<00:04:47.020> kind<00:04:47.620> of<00:04:47.740> more<00:04:47.949> grinding

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
making the game kind of more grinding

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.110 
making the game kind of more grinding
now<00:04:48.759> it<00:04:49.060> keeps<00:04:49.690> your<00:04:50.020> Lions<00:04:50.650> maybe<00:04:51.099> more<00:04:51.940> in

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
now it keeps your Lions maybe more in

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.020 
now it keeps your Lions maybe more in
proportion<00:04:52.270> to<00:04:52.930> your<00:04:53.050> research<00:04:53.560> so<00:04:54.069> you'll<00:04:54.910> be

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
proportion to your research so you'll be

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:57.150 
proportion to your research so you'll be
unlocking<00:04:55.840> things<00:04:56.050> when<00:04:56.500> you're<00:04:56.770> able<00:04:56.919> to

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
unlocking things when you're able to

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.100 
unlocking things when you're able to
still<00:04:57.669> be<00:04:57.759> able<00:04:57.849> to<00:04:57.970> purchase<00:04:58.240> them<00:04:58.569> rather

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
still be able to purchase them rather

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:01.110 
still be able to purchase them rather
than<00:04:59.259> unlocking<00:04:59.919> them<00:05:00.130> and<00:05:00.340> then<00:05:00.550> waiting<00:05:00.970> a

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:01.120 
than unlocking them and then waiting a

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.400 
than unlocking them and then waiting a
while<00:05:01.300> before<00:05:01.630> you<00:05:01.840> can<00:05:01.990> actually<00:05:02.110> purchase

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
while before you can actually purchase

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.710 
while before you can actually purchase
them<00:05:02.770> notice<00:05:03.699> how<00:05:03.880> I<00:05:03.909> said<00:05:04.270> it<00:05:04.300> doesn't<00:05:04.509> really

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 
them notice how I said it doesn't really

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.140 
them notice how I said it doesn't really
affect<00:05:04.810> a<00:05:05.169> person<00:05:05.530> of<00:05:05.680> like<00:05:06.039> my<00:05:06.220> my<00:05:06.849> stats

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
you've unlocked near enough everything

that you're saving up so much lions

anymore so another question to answer is

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.050 
anymore so another question to answer is
who<00:05:29.289> does<00:05:29.470> this<00:05:29.650> benefit<00:05:30.039> the<00:05:30.520> player<00:05:30.789> or

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
who does this benefit the player or

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.689 
who does this benefit the player or
gaijin<00:05:31.630> well<00:05:32.409> firstly<00:05:32.830> it<00:05:33.159> definitely

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:33.699 
gaijin well firstly it definitely

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:35.249 
gaijin well firstly it definitely
benefits<00:05:34.120> guys<00:05:34.419> in<00:05:34.720> because<00:05:35.110> they've

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:35.259 
benefits guys in because they've

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:37.800 
benefits guys in because they've
effectively<00:05:35.650> monetized<00:05:36.280> the<00:05:37.120> booth<00:05:37.360> system

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:37.810 
effectively monetized the booth system

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.360 
effectively monetized the booth system
so<00:05:37.960> that<00:05:37.990> players<00:05:38.349> can<00:05:38.469> now<00:05:38.650> spend<00:05:39.009> Golden

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.370 
so that players can now spend Golden

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:41.459 
so that players can now spend Golden
Eagles<00:05:39.699> directly<00:05:40.210> to<00:05:40.360> get<00:05:40.479> boost<00:05:40.719> or<00:05:41.050> to<00:05:41.320> get

00:05:41.459 --> 00:05:41.469 
Eagles directly to get boost or to get

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:44.700 
Eagles directly to get boost or to get
them<00:05:41.620> through<00:05:41.650> battle<00:05:42.310> trophies<00:05:43.560> for<00:05:44.560> the

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 
them through battle trophies for the

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.580 
them through battle trophies for the
ping<00:05:44.949> player<00:05:45.610> I<00:05:45.940> guess<00:05:46.659> it<00:05:47.110> could<00:05:47.229> be<00:05:47.320> a<00:05:47.349> nice

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:47.590 
ping player I guess it could be a nice

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:49.320 
ping player I guess it could be a nice
thing<00:05:47.620> because<00:05:48.190> now<00:05:48.370> they<00:05:48.520> can<00:05:48.699> get<00:05:48.789> boosts<00:05:49.240> on

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:49.330 
thing because now they can get boosts on

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.510 
thing because now they can get boosts on
demand<00:05:49.690> by<00:05:50.229> getting<00:05:50.710> them<00:05:50.800> directly<00:05:51.250> or

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
demand by getting them directly or

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.300 
demand by getting them directly or
through<00:05:52.120> battle<00:05:52.479> trophies<00:05:52.900> and<00:05:53.139> for<00:05:53.949> the<00:05:54.070> free

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:54.310 
through battle trophies and for the free

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:55.860 
through battle trophies and for the free
player<00:05:54.580> well<00:05:55.180> I<00:05:55.210> think<00:05:55.389> this<00:05:55.570> is<00:05:55.630> actually

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
player well I think this is actually

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:57.930 
player well I think this is actually
worse<00:05:56.259> for<00:05:56.560> them<00:05:56.740> because<00:05:57.130> the<00:05:57.430> only<00:05:57.580> way<00:05:57.789> they

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:57.940 
worse for them because the only way they

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.649 
worse for them because the only way they
can<00:05:58.150> get<00:05:58.360> boosts<00:05:58.780> is<00:05:59.340> by<00:06:00.340> getting<00:06:01.150> them<00:06:01.419> from

00:06:01.649 --> 00:06:01.659 
can get boosts is by getting them from

00:06:01.659 --> 00:06:03.390 
can get boosts is by getting them from
daily<00:06:01.930> rewards<00:06:02.500> you've<00:06:02.800> got<00:06:03.069> you<00:06:03.250> know<00:06:03.310> a

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 
daily rewards you've got you know a

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.580 
daily rewards you've got you know a
chance<00:06:03.699> of<00:06:03.849> getting<00:06:03.880> a<00:06:04.240> certain<00:06:05.020> boost<00:06:05.259> out<00:06:05.530> of

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:05.590 
chance of getting a certain boost out of

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:07.350 
chance of getting a certain boost out of
those<00:06:05.830> daily<00:06:06.039> rewards<00:06:06.580> now<00:06:06.849> I<00:06:06.880> find<00:06:07.120> it<00:06:07.180> kind

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
those daily rewards now I find it kind

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.670 
those daily rewards now I find it kind
of<00:06:07.389> surprising<00:06:07.930> at<00:06:08.020> the<00:06:08.110> same<00:06:08.289> time<00:06:08.469> they

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680 
of surprising at the same time they

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.320 
of surprising at the same time they
didn't<00:06:08.949> mention<00:06:09.310> it<00:06:09.370> in<00:06:09.490> the<00:06:09.580> patch<00:06:09.759> notes<00:06:09.789> but

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:10.330 
didn't mention it in the patch notes but

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:11.939 
didn't mention it in the patch notes but
then<00:06:10.479> again<00:06:10.599> i'm<00:06:10.900> also<00:06:11.020> not<00:06:11.409> surprised

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:11.949 
then again i'm also not surprised

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:14.010 
then again i'm also not surprised
because<00:06:12.250> if<00:06:12.819> they<00:06:13.120> did<00:06:13.180> then<00:06:13.569> chances<00:06:13.930> are

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:14.020 
because if they did then chances are

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:15.899 
because if they did then chances are
that<00:06:14.080> we've<00:06:14.319> got<00:06:14.530> a<00:06:14.560> big<00:06:14.800> backlash<00:06:15.310> about<00:06:15.669> it

00:06:15.899 --> 00:06:15.909 
that we've got a big backlash about it

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:18.809 
that we've got a big backlash about it
but<00:06:16.719> i'm<00:06:17.469> still<00:06:17.830> kind<00:06:18.069> of<00:06:18.130> on<00:06:18.310> the<00:06:18.370> fence<00:06:18.610> about

00:06:18.809 --> 00:06:18.819 
but i'm still kind of on the fence about

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:20.610 
but i'm still kind of on the fence about
this<00:06:19.000> I'm<00:06:19.180> quite<00:06:19.509> neutral<00:06:19.930> I<00:06:20.110> think<00:06:20.289> this<00:06:20.349> pros

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:20.620 
this I'm quite neutral I think this pros

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.290 
this I'm quite neutral I think this pros
and<00:06:20.800> cons<00:06:20.949> to<00:06:21.099> each<00:06:21.190> system<00:06:21.699> now<00:06:22.090> this

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:22.300 
and cons to each system now this

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:24.180 
and cons to each system now this
flexibility<00:06:23.020> with<00:06:23.289> these<00:06:23.440> boots<00:06:23.710> are<00:06:23.860> coming

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:24.190 
flexibility with these boots are coming

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.600 
flexibility with these boots are coming
out<00:06:24.340> you<00:06:24.969> can<00:06:25.150> select<00:06:25.620> what<00:06:26.620> nations<00:06:27.280> you<00:06:27.430> want

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:27.610 
out you can select what nations you want

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:29.399 
out you can select what nations you want
to<00:06:27.699> use<00:06:27.849> it<00:06:27.880> on<00:06:28.120> for<00:06:28.389> example<00:06:28.900> I<00:06:29.080> can<00:06:29.199> have

00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:29.409 
to use it on for example I can have

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:32.399 
to use it on for example I can have
varying<00:06:29.800> degrees<00:06:30.219> of<00:06:30.780> how<00:06:31.780> effective<00:06:32.319> the

00:06:32.399 --> 00:06:32.409 
varying degrees of how effective the

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:34.290 
varying degrees of how effective the
boosts<00:06:32.800> our<00:06:32.889> how<00:06:33.280> many<00:06:33.430> matches<00:06:33.639> it<00:06:34.030> can<00:06:34.150> last

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:34.300 
boosts our how many matches it can last

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.629 
boosts our how many matches it can last
over<00:06:34.599> so<00:06:35.020> I<00:06:35.050> guess<00:06:35.409> there's<00:06:35.710> no<00:06:35.979> pros<00:06:36.280> and<00:06:36.460> cons

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:36.639 
over so I guess there's no pros and cons

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:39.209 
over so I guess there's no pros and cons
and<00:06:36.880> I'm<00:06:37.240> quite<00:06:37.449> on<00:06:37.659> the<00:06:37.870> fence<00:06:38.050> about<00:06:38.229> it<00:06:38.560> but

00:06:39.209 --> 00:06:39.219 
and I'm quite on the fence about it but

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:40.890
