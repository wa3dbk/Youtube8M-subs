00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:14.730
 very well 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:25.640
 We are in minecraft and today I love you 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.970
 show a mod that I thought was pretty 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.939
 interesting is called how I did it in the 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.540
 big title of goldstone armor 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:36.750
 movement 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.660
 then let's say you're going to ask what 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.060
 is this that I show you what it's for 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.660
 is 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.660
 to the son 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.800
 here we continue with some champions 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:10.210
 well here usually if that does not fall 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:13.260
 height one dies but with this 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.260
 wait a second 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.340
 but with this 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:29.079
 here is a box with a glider 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:32.050
 then he puts it on us and squeezing the 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:34.000
 people always always the epe 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.640
 then here we are falling but 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.240
 we complete live and we are planning 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.479
 as 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.899
 and we want forgiveness was black water this 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.899
 wait 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:54.380
 means though 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.380
 how did you plan with that 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.230
 goes up 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.640
 well the other then to plan this 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:17.890
 it's a parachute then it just 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.510
 once pressed the buckle and the other was 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.220
 practical to plan and so the 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.269
 fast this is only to fall then 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:28.709
 no place is falling to efe not slow 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.709
 can direct where we are going here 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.820
 good 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.820
 this 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:53.750
 it's called the cap 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:59.630
 that is with the f giving is with space but 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:02.890
 is we think and we fall 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.890
 to the 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:07.040
 and we are going 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:20.330
 and I do not know year because I think yes I jump 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.330
 here and we will also leave 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.390
 let's not say it hurt 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:37.330
 the next one is in a jetpack 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:40.150
 well as the name says it's a check 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.930
 pack and we are already pushing is faster 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.930
 Qualify but mine 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.459
 that 's all in film 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.860
 and ready 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.560
 this very useful I am going to show you the 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:05.849
 that I find very useful 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:09.300
 this is a broom helmets can not be 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:11.840
 possible it can be if we are going to breathe 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.840
 underwater 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.939
 then we do like this 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.910
 and perfect 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.990
 we are not seeing and nothing 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.990
 good another 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.740
 live 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:37.110
 It serves as a lifesaver 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:41.249
 it is not here we are normal but if we are going to 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:45.379
 out you never know nor place space alone 

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:45.379
 We're going forward this will happen 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:49.889
 is what happens 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.249
 to me 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:52.249
 good 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:58.680
 those are the ones that seem like more 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:03.550
 useful this is a rapto link 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:08.470
 we have already done so that we do not throw 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:11.880
 and we will do hello hello here 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.880
 and ready this 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.620
 hamas are not us this to run 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:23.850
 all right 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.850
 And I think 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:30.350
 and we are running create 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.350
 it is also high 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:39.440
 Wow 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:44.800
 The more speed is higher, the higher 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.800
 well this does not use this mount 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:57.430
 You see, we are climbing mountains 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:00.430
 ouch good 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:03.750
 Well, that was like the most important thing 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.750
 I wanted to show you on this bike 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:12.989

00:06:09.249 --> 00:06:12.989
 and we talk to my friend 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:16.670
