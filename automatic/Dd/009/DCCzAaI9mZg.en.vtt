there<00:00:20.029> is<00:00:20.270> very<00:00:20.689> much<00:00:20.930> a<00:00:20.990> wow<00:00:21.439> factor

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.080 

really<00:00:25.560> changes<00:00:26.560> the<00:00:27.430> way<00:00:27.460> we<00:00:27.580> think<00:00:27.910> about

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.090 
really changes the way we think about

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.360 
really changes the way we think about
production<00:00:28.890> being<00:00:29.890> able<00:00:30.040> to<00:00:30.160> make<00:00:30.340> a

production being able to make a
difference<00:00:31.020> is<00:00:32.020> really<00:00:32.320> what<00:00:32.500> inspired<00:00:32.920> this

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
difference is really what inspired this

difference is really what inspired this
is<00:00:34.060> one<00:00:34.240> of<00:00:34.360> those<00:00:34.450> industries<00:00:35.140> that<00:00:35.890> matches

part and they take advantage of what 3d
printing<00:02:06.100> can<00:02:06.310> really<00:02:06.609> do<00:02:06.789> which<00:02:07.390> is<00:02:07.509> very

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
printing can really do which is very

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:09.960 
printing can really do which is very
complex<00:02:08.259> geometries<00:02:09.039> that<00:02:09.429> just<00:02:09.670> can't<00:02:09.849> be

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
complex geometries that just can't be

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.670 
complex geometries that just can't be
made<00:02:10.119> by<00:02:10.239> other<00:02:10.720> means

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.289 

we're<00:02:14.680> working<00:02:15.099> with<00:02:15.129> stratasys<00:02:15.879> what<00:02:16.180> we're

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
we're working with stratasys what we're

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:18.780 
we're working with stratasys what we're
trying<00:02:16.480> to<00:02:16.690> do<00:02:16.840> is<00:02:17.019> take<00:02:17.260> their<00:02:17.650> technology<00:02:18.459> go

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
trying to do is take their technology go

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.509 
trying to do is take their technology go
from<00:02:19.150> prototyping<00:02:20.080> to<00:02:20.349> real<00:02:20.560> manufacturing

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
from prototyping to real manufacturing

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:23.729 
from prototyping to real manufacturing
you<00:02:21.760> can<00:02:21.940> make<00:02:22.150> parts<00:02:22.629> you<00:02:22.840> can<00:02:23.019> make<00:02:23.200> systems

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
you can make parts you can make systems

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.979 
you can make parts you can make systems
that<00:02:24.010> can't<00:02:24.400> be<00:02:24.549> made<00:02:24.760> any<00:02:25.180> other<00:02:25.480> way<00:02:25.690> this

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
that can't be made any other way this

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:27.420 
that can't be made any other way this
was<00:02:26.140> a<00:02:26.170> 3d<00:02:26.500> printed<00:02:26.799> model<00:02:27.099> that<00:02:27.280> is

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
was a 3d printed model that is

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.380 
was a 3d printed model that is
absolutely<00:02:28.120> incredible<00:02:30.269> having<00:02:31.269> this

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
absolutely incredible having this

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.770 
absolutely incredible having this
technology<00:02:31.630> here<00:02:32.380> was<00:02:32.680> a<00:02:32.709> game-changer<00:02:33.780> it

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
technology here was a game-changer it

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:35.940 
technology here was a game-changer it
was<00:02:34.900> the<00:02:34.989> difference<00:02:35.290> between<00:02:35.590> killing<00:02:35.829> a

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
was the difference between killing a

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.900 
was the difference between killing a
program<00:02:36.340> and<00:02:36.519> keeping<00:02:36.790> it<00:02:36.880> moving<00:02:37.150> forward
