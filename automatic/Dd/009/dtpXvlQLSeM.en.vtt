your child now there's only really a
couple<00:00:19.500> factors<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:20.400> take<00:00:20.580> in<00:00:20.820> here<00:00:21.090> to<00:00:21.750> point

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
couple factors to take in here to point

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:23.870 
couple factors to take in here to point
her<00:00:22.560> in<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.680> right<00:00:22.740> direction<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.490> main<00:00:23.670> one

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
her in the right direction the main one

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.640 
her in the right direction the main one
is<00:00:24.060> going<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.330> be<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.510> height<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.050> their

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
is going to be the height and their

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.099 
is going to be the height and their
ability<00:00:26.189> level<00:00:26.220> now<00:00:27.150> between<00:00:27.420> those<00:00:27.720> two

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
ability level now between those two

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.589 
ability level now between those two
you're<00:00:28.529> really<00:00:28.859> gonna<00:00:29.070> get<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.640> pretty<00:00:30.210> small

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
you're really gonna get a pretty small

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.840 
you're really gonna get a pretty small
range<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:31.230> skis<00:00:31.500> that<00:00:31.769> are<00:00:31.830> gonna<00:00:31.920> suit<00:00:32.279> them

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
range of skis that are gonna suit them

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.569 
range of skis that are gonna suit them
the<00:00:33.390> best<00:00:33.690> so<00:00:34.380> some<00:00:34.620> basic<00:00:34.710> rules<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.340> thumb

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
the best so some basic rules of thumb

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.090 
the best so some basic rules of thumb
here<00:00:35.850> when<00:00:36.059> determining<00:00:36.780> what<00:00:37.260> size<00:00:37.290> ski<00:00:37.920> to

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
here when determining what size ski to

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.049 
here when determining what size ski to
have<00:00:38.309> is<00:00:38.790> if<00:00:39.570> they're<00:00:39.809> about<00:00:40.050> three<00:00:41.059> you'd

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
have is if they're about three you'd

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.229 
have is if they're about three you'd
want<00:00:42.899> something<00:00:43.260> that's<00:00:43.590> up<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.940> armpit

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
want something that's up to the armpit

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.700 
want something that's up to the armpit
since<00:00:45.660> they're<00:00:45.809> pretty<00:00:45.840> little<00:00:46.320> don't<00:00:46.559> have<00:00:46.680> a

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
since they're pretty little don't have a

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.410 
since they're pretty little don't have a
lot<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:46.950> muscle<00:00:47.250> control<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.910> need<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.059> small

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
lot of muscle control you need a small

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.540 
lot of muscle control you need a small
ski<00:00:48.690> as<00:00:48.899> they<00:00:49.440> start<00:00:49.680> growing<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:50.100> little<00:00:50.340> more

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
ski as they start growing a little more

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.119 
ski as they start growing a little more
maybe<00:00:50.879> three<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.329> five<00:00:51.360> range<00:00:52.010> something<00:00:53.010> up

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
maybe three to five range something up

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.279 
maybe three to five range something up
to<00:00:53.250> their<00:00:53.399> chin<00:00:53.789> is<00:00:54.090> gonna<00:00:54.420> work<00:00:54.629> just<00:00:55.140> fine

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
to their chin is gonna work just fine

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.529 
to their chin is gonna work just fine
and<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:56.010> also<00:00:56.160> want<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.579> keep<00:00:56.760> in<00:00:56.940> mind<00:00:57.000> here

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
and you also want to keep in mind here

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.569 
and you also want to keep in mind here
that<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.930> shorter<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.500> ski<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:59.100> more

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
that the shorter the ski the more

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.729 
that the shorter the ski the more
maneuverable<00:01:00.180> it's<00:01:00.329> gonna<00:01:00.539> be<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:01.230> opposite

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
maneuverable it's gonna be the opposite

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.200 
maneuverable it's gonna be the opposite
for<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.010> longer<00:01:02.460> skis<00:01:02.789> where<00:01:03.059> you're<00:01:03.149> gonna

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
for the longer skis where you're gonna

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.140 
for the longer skis where you're gonna
have<00:01:03.449> more<00:01:03.690> control<00:01:04.229> at<00:01:04.589> speed<00:01:05.280> but<00:01:05.640> you're

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
have more control at speed but you're

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.330 
have more control at speed but you're
not<00:01:06.330> gonna<00:01:06.510> have<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.780> maneuverability<00:01:07.340> then

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
not gonna have the maneuverability then

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.620 
not gonna have the maneuverability then
it's<00:01:08.460> gonna<00:01:08.580> be<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.760> little<00:01:09.000> more<00:01:09.119> work<00:01:09.390> for

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
it's gonna be a little more work for

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.950 
it's gonna be a little more work for
them<00:01:09.810> so<00:01:10.290> ability<00:01:11.100> will<00:01:11.549> be<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:12.000> factor<00:01:12.540> as<00:01:12.780> well

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
them so ability will be a factor as well

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.880 
them so ability will be a factor as well
for<00:01:13.409> example<00:01:13.590> here<00:01:14.310> we<00:01:14.610> have<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.850> young

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
for example here we have a young

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.249 
for example here we have a young
intermediate<00:01:16.890> beginner<00:01:17.430> here<00:01:18.090> so<00:01:18.720> we've

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
intermediate beginner here so we've

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.710 
intermediate beginner here so we've
measured<00:01:19.740> up<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.490> his<00:01:20.640> nose<00:01:20.939> which<00:01:21.330> is<00:01:21.450> about

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
measured up to his nose which is about

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.800 
measured up to his nose which is about
42<00:01:22.200> inches<00:01:22.770> which<00:01:23.100> equates<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.610> roughly<00:01:24.509> a

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
42 inches which equates to roughly a

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.590 
42 inches which equates to roughly a
hundred<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.350> seven<00:01:25.740> centimeters<00:01:26.520> so<00:01:27.180> his

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
hundred and seven centimeters so his

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.450 
hundred and seven centimeters so his
ideal<00:01:27.990> ski<00:01:28.439> at<00:01:28.590> this<00:01:28.770> point<00:01:29.070> would<00:01:29.189> be<00:01:29.340> the

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
ideal ski at this point would be the

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.590 
ideal ski at this point would be the
head<00:01:29.700> PES<00:01:30.680> 107<00:01:31.680> now<00:01:32.369> let's<00:01:32.579> say<00:01:32.790> this<00:01:33.240> was<00:01:33.450> his

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
head PES 107 now let's say this was his

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.080 
head PES 107 now let's say this was his
first<00:01:33.960> day<00:01:34.200> on<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.590> slopes<00:01:34.890> never<00:01:35.700> been<00:01:35.939> out

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
first day on the slopes never been out

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.420 
first day on the slopes never been out
before<00:01:36.479> probably<00:01:37.380> want<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.770> set<00:01:37.979> him<00:01:38.070> up<00:01:38.189> with

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
before probably want to set him up with

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.450 
before probably want to set him up with
something<00:01:39.240> like<00:01:39.450> this<00:01:39.780> which<00:01:40.380> is<00:01:40.439> roughly<00:01:41.070> up

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
something like this which is roughly up

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.380 
something like this which is roughly up
to<00:01:41.880> his<00:01:42.150> shoulder<00:01:42.780> armpit<00:01:43.740> area<00:01:43.950> if<00:01:44.430> this<00:01:45.149> had

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
to his shoulder armpit area if this had

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.370 
to his shoulder armpit area if this had
been<00:01:46.070> his<00:01:47.329> 300th<00:01:48.329> day<00:01:48.540> on<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.899> hill<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.259> he

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
been his 300th day on the hill and he

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.679 
been his 300th day on the hill and he
was<00:01:49.530> super<00:01:50.040> advanced<00:01:50.579> skier<00:01:51.030> for<00:01:51.299> his<00:01:51.479> age

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
was super advanced skier for his age

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.749 
was super advanced skier for his age
probably<00:01:52.560> go<00:01:52.710> with<00:01:52.920> something<00:01:53.340> like<00:01:53.520> this

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
probably go with something like this

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.780 
probably go with something like this
that's<00:01:54.270> about<00:01:54.479> up<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.110> forehead<00:01:55.649> or<00:01:56.040> if

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
that's about up to the forehead or if

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.219 
that's about up to the forehead or if
he's<00:01:57.000> really<00:01:57.180> advanced<00:01:57.719> you<00:01:57.780> could<00:01:57.960> start

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
he's really advanced you could start

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.130 
he's really advanced you could start
getting<00:01:58.350> into<00:01:58.710> junior<00:01:59.070> race<00:01:59.640> skis<00:02:00.060> even<00:02:00.509> but

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
getting into junior race skis even but

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.520 
getting into junior race skis even but
also<00:02:02.130> remember<00:02:02.670> that<00:02:03.090> these<00:02:03.270> are<00:02:03.450> all<00:02:03.630> just

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
also remember that these are all just

your<00:02:16.579> child<00:02:16.939> will<00:02:17.599> obviously<00:02:18.290> have<00:02:18.620> grown<00:02:19.010> and

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
your child will obviously have grown and

your child will obviously have grown and
once<00:02:20.090> they<00:02:20.239> start<00:02:20.540> exceeding<00:02:21.200> the<00:02:21.500> 5-foot

transition into a young adult ski now
the<00:02:30.920> main<00:02:31.159> difference<00:02:31.189> there<00:02:31.819> is<00:02:32.090> going<00:02:32.299> to<00:02:32.359> be

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
the main difference there is going to be

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.629 
the main difference there is going to be
the<00:02:32.659> wood<00:02:32.900> cores<00:02:33.290> as<00:02:33.739> compared<00:02:34.159> to<00:02:34.280> the<00:02:34.400> foam

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:34.639 
the wood cores as compared to the foam

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:37.959 
the wood cores as compared to the foam
cores<00:02:35.030> as<00:02:35.599> seen<00:02:35.930> in<00:02:36.109> these<00:02:36.319> which<00:02:37.189> the<00:02:37.760> wood

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:37.969 
cores as seen in these which the wood

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:40.869 
cores as seen in these which the wood
ones<00:02:38.209> are<00:02:38.659> much<00:02:39.230> stiffer<00:02:39.680> and<00:02:40.129> they're<00:02:40.730> much

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:40.879 
ones are much stiffer and they're much

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:42.490 
ones are much stiffer and they're much
more<00:02:41.030> responsive<00:02:41.629> as<00:02:41.780> compared<00:02:42.109> to<00:02:42.170> the<00:02:42.290> foam

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
more responsive as compared to the foam

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.410 
more responsive as compared to the foam
cores<00:02:42.859> are<00:02:43.129> there<00:02:43.280> basically<00:02:43.459> to<00:02:43.879> keep<00:02:44.239> the

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
cores are there basically to keep the

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.149 
cores are there basically to keep the
ski<00:02:44.689> light<00:02:44.989> and<00:02:45.260> maneuverable<00:02:45.349> for<00:02:46.069> your

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:46.159 
ski light and maneuverable for your

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:48.009 
ski light and maneuverable for your
child<00:02:46.430> so<00:02:47.000> as<00:02:47.120> they're<00:02:47.269> stronger<00:02:47.780> they'll

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
child so as they're stronger they'll

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:49.690 
child so as they're stronger they'll
just<00:02:48.230> naturally<00:02:48.739> want<00:02:48.919> to<00:02:49.040> progress<00:02:49.189> into

just naturally want to progress into

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.179 
just naturally want to progress into
those<00:02:49.879> skis<00:02:50.209> anyway<00:02:50.780> and<00:02:51.049> they'll<00:02:51.680> have<00:02:51.859> much
