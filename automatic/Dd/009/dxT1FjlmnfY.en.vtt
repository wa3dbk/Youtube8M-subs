00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
soon white smoke is going to start

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.170 
soon white smoke is going to start
billowing<00:01:34.380> out<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.830> top<00:01:35.009> hole<00:01:35.280> that's

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
billowing out of the top hole that's

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.749 
billowing out of the top hole that's
good<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.659> has<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.380> happen<00:01:37.530> that's<00:01:38.369> all<00:01:38.549> the

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.850 
good that has to happen that's all the
gases<00:01:38.970> escaping<00:01:39.509> from<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.960> cotton<00:01:40.440> becoming

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
gases escaping from the cotton becoming

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.389 
gases escaping from the cotton becoming
charred<00:01:41.190> okay<00:01:42.229> we<00:01:43.229> go<00:01:43.380> if<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:44.009> don't<00:01:44.039> put<00:01:44.369> a

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
charred okay we go if you don't put a

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.889 
charred okay we go if you don't put a
hole<00:01:44.580> in<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.729> lid<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.090> list<00:01:45.299> gonna<00:01:45.450> pop<00:01:45.690> up

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
hole in the lid the list gonna pop up

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.550 
hole in the lid the list gonna pop up
from<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.229> expanding<00:01:46.649> gases<00:01:48.320> will<00:01:49.320> get<00:01:49.439> the

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
from the expanding gases will get the

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.420 
from the expanding gases will get the
whole<00:01:49.770> it's<00:01:50.250> spewing<00:01:50.700> out<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.539> white<00:01:51.780> smoke

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
whole it's spewing out the white smoke

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.770 
whole it's spewing out the white smoke
very<00:01:53.430> very<00:01:53.580> fast<00:01:53.850> which<00:01:54.299> means<00:01:54.330> the

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
very very fast which means the

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.149 
very very fast which means the
decomposition<00:01:55.439> of<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.649> continent<00:01:56.100> is

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
decomposition of the continent is

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.090 
decomposition of the continent is
starting<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.580> occur<00:01:56.850> now<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.810> goal<00:01:58.679> here<00:01:58.710> is

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
starting to occur now the goal here is

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.980 
starting to occur now the goal here is
to<00:01:59.130> not<00:01:59.580> let<00:01:59.909> the<00:01:59.970> cotton<00:02:00.450> catch<00:02:00.630> on<00:02:00.780> fire

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
to not let the cotton catch on fire

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.840 
to not let the cotton catch on fire
that's<00:02:01.920> why<00:02:02.069> it's<00:02:02.220> in<00:02:02.310> an<00:02:02.369> airtight<00:02:02.549> container

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
that's why it's in an airtight container

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.889 
that's why it's in an airtight container
with<00:02:03.240> only<00:02:03.390> one<00:02:03.659> hole

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.440 

Tim<00:02:09.560> containers<00:02:10.099> were<00:02:10.340> definitely<00:02:11.060> the<00:02:11.269> best

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
Tim containers were definitely the best

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.960 
Tim containers were definitely the best
can<00:02:12.260> be<00:02:12.409> done<00:02:12.590> in<00:02:12.769> glass<00:02:13.010> containers<00:02:13.220> but<00:02:13.849> you

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
can be done in glass containers but you

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.369 
can be done in glass containers but you
have<00:02:14.090> to<00:02:14.239> heat<00:02:14.390> up<00:02:14.450> the<00:02:14.599> glass<00:02:14.810> very<00:02:15.140> very

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:15.379 
have to heat up the glass very very

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:19.179 
have to heat up the glass very very
slowly<00:02:15.680> otherwise<00:02:16.640> it<00:02:16.939> will<00:02:17.860> crack<00:02:18.860> and<00:02:18.890> split

00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:19.189 
slowly otherwise it will crack and split

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:21.130 
slowly otherwise it will crack and split
just<00:02:19.819> like<00:02:19.909> this<00:02:20.180> glass<00:02:20.510> spit<00:02:20.750> on<00:02:20.870> me<00:02:21.049> this

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
just like this glass spit on me this

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.979

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
of it around the vent hole there and

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.140 
of it around the vent hole there and
it's<00:02:57.859> kind<00:02:58.040> of<00:02:58.069> dripping<00:02:58.370> on<00:02:58.459> the<00:02:58.489> sides<00:02:58.849> and

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
it's kind of dripping on the sides and

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.569 
it's kind of dripping on the sides and
getting<00:02:59.510> in<00:02:59.629> there<00:02:59.810> and<00:02:59.959> I'm<00:03:00.079> worrying<00:03:00.739> that

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:01.579 
getting in there and I'm worrying that

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:04.360 
getting in there and I'm worrying that
the<00:03:01.730> heat<00:03:01.970> of<00:03:02.150> this<00:03:02.840> fire<00:03:03.290> might<00:03:03.709> be<00:03:03.859> decaying

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
the heat of this fire might be decaying

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.270 
the heat of this fire might be decaying
the<00:03:05.359> integrity<00:03:05.900> of<00:03:05.930> the<00:03:06.170> bottom<00:03:06.439> of<00:03:06.590> the<00:03:06.680> 10<00:03:06.889> so

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
the integrity of the bottom of the 10 so

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.280 
the integrity of the bottom of the 10 so
hopefully<00:03:07.489> it<00:03:08.150> won't<00:03:08.480> burn<00:03:08.689> through<00:03:09.019> because

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
hopefully it won't burn through because

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:16.420 
hopefully it won't burn through because
if<00:03:09.409> it<00:03:09.500> does<00:03:09.650> it'll<00:03:09.859> ruin<00:03:10.010> my<00:03:10.129> char<00:03:10.400> cloth<00:03:15.430> all
