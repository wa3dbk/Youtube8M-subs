00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
under sterile conditions just in the

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.130 
under sterile conditions just in the
same<00:01:06.040> way<00:01:06.220> as<00:01:06.280> we<00:01:06.490> did<00:01:06.640> when<00:01:06.940> we<00:01:06.970> sold<00:01:07.780> the<00:01:07.870> seed

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140

initially what today what we're doing
I'm<00:01:10.630> going<00:01:10.720> to<00:01:10.780> do<00:01:10.900> a<00:01:10.930> little<00:01:11.110> experiment<00:01:11.409> for

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
I'm going to do a little experiment for

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.770 
I'm going to do a little experiment for
you<00:01:11.890> and<00:01:12.159> show<00:01:12.310> you<00:01:12.340> how<00:01:12.520> to<00:01:12.580> do<00:01:12.820> it<00:01:12.909> on<00:01:13.150> a<00:01:13.210> much

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
you and show you how to do it on a much

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.210 
you and show you how to do it on a much
easier<00:01:13.960> way<00:01:15.900> here's<00:01:16.900> one<00:01:17.049> that<00:01:17.170> I<00:01:17.229> did<00:01:17.530> from

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
easier way here's one that I did from

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.300 
easier way here's one that I did from
the<00:01:18.370> same<00:01:18.549> batch<00:01:19.289> bucking<00:01:20.289> above<00:01:20.860> six<00:01:21.130> weeks

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
the same batch bucking above six weeks

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.100 
the same batch bucking above six weeks
ago<00:01:21.579> I<00:01:21.610> think<00:01:22.030> I<00:01:22.270> don't<00:01:22.390> know<00:01:22.570> if<00:01:22.630> you<00:01:22.719> can<00:01:22.869> see

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
ago I think I don't know if you can see

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.130 
ago I think I don't know if you can see
that<00:01:23.350> I'll<00:01:23.439> see<00:01:23.590> if<00:01:23.649> I<00:01:23.710> can<00:01:23.829> adjust<00:01:24.460> it

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
that I'll see if I can adjust it

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.649 
that I'll see if I can adjust it
they're<00:01:26.140> not<00:01:26.350> on<00:01:26.770> the<00:01:26.829> surface<00:01:27.659> little

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
they're not on the surface little

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.349 
they're not on the surface little
seedlings<00:01:30.119> they're<00:01:31.119> doing<00:01:31.359> really<00:01:31.539> nice<00:01:31.920> so

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:33.359 
seedlings they're doing really nice so

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:36.209 
seedlings they're doing really nice so
is<00:01:34.359> well<00:01:34.570> we<00:01:34.750> do<00:01:34.869> it<00:01:34.990> we've<00:01:35.680> got<00:01:35.859> we've<00:01:35.979> got<00:01:36.100> as

is well we do it we've got we've got as

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:41.340 
is well we do it we've got we've got as
just<00:01:36.670> cubes<00:01:38.159> with<00:01:39.159> the<00:01:39.490> blue<00:01:40.359> lids<00:01:40.600> I<00:01:40.869> get

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
just cubes with the blue lids I get

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.109

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
the filter membrane we don't really

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:46.889 
the filter membrane we don't really
necessarily<00:01:45.039> need<00:01:45.609> that<00:01:45.670> book<00:01:46.060> there<00:01:46.780> on

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
necessarily need that book there on

necessarily need that book there on
anyway<00:01:47.229> so<00:01:47.609> and<00:01:48.609> in<00:01:48.789> each<00:01:48.969> cube<00:01:49.560> I've<00:01:50.560> added

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
anyway so and in each cube I've added

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.520 
anyway so and in each cube I've added
that<00:01:52.810> much<00:01:53.609> peat<00:01:54.609> which<00:01:55.119> is<00:01:55.350> straightforward

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
that much peat which is straightforward

00:01:59.459 --> 00:01:59.469 
spag the moss Pete there's a cost

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:02.120 
spag the moss Pete there's a cost
material<00:02:00.100> and<00:02:00.460> what<00:02:01.359> I've<00:02:01.450> done<00:02:01.600> with<00:02:01.780> this

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
material and what I've done with this

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:08.340 
material and what I've done with this
this<00:02:03.130> is<00:02:03.189> a<00:02:03.789> jewel<00:02:04.090> containing<00:02:05.759> 2<00:02:06.759> litres<00:02:07.350> it

it's effectively going to sterile
is<00:02:29.840> in<00:02:29.990> so<00:02:30.740> once<00:02:30.920> that's<00:02:31.040> cooled<00:02:31.310> down<00:02:31.550> you<00:02:32.530> can

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
is in so once that's cooled down you can

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.670 
is in so once that's cooled down you can
then<00:02:33.710> put<00:02:34.040> it<00:02:34.100> into<00:02:34.310> your<00:02:34.480> tubes<00:02:35.480> now<00:02:36.470> what

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
then put it into your tubes now what

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.250 
then put it into your tubes now what
I've<00:02:36.800> done<00:02:36.830> as<00:02:37.370> well<00:02:37.580> in<00:02:37.850> order<00:02:38.810> to<00:02:38.960> get<00:02:39.110> myself

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
I've done as well in order to get myself

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.050 
I've done as well in order to get myself
a<00:02:39.500> nice<00:02:39.650> flat<00:02:39.980> surface<00:02:40.190> on<00:02:40.610> the<00:02:40.700> top<00:02:40.880> of<00:02:41.000> the

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
a nice flat surface on the top of the

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.450 
a nice flat surface on the top of the
compost<00:02:41.420> on<00:02:41.720> top<00:02:41.750> of<00:02:41.990> the<00:02:42.050> peat<00:02:42.260> I've<00:02:42.980> dribbled

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
compost on top of the peat I've dribbled

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.740 
compost on top of the peat I've dribbled
in<00:02:43.640> just<00:02:44.210> a<00:02:44.330> few<00:02:44.680> drops<00:02:45.680> of<00:02:46.160> water<00:02:47.120> onto<00:02:47.570> the

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
in just a few drops of water onto the

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.170 
in just a few drops of water onto the
surface<00:02:48.260> to<00:02:48.440> make<00:02:48.560> it<00:02:48.710> flat<00:02:48.980> nice<00:02:49.820> and<00:02:50.030> flat

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
surface to make it flat nice and flat

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.880 
surface to make it flat nice and flat
and<00:02:50.300> moist<00:02:50.510> now<00:02:51.140> they're<00:02:51.320> not<00:02:51.470> wringing<00:02:51.860> wet

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
and moist now they're not wringing wet

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.010 
and moist now they're not wringing wet
as<00:02:52.220> you<00:02:52.310> can<00:02:52.430> see<00:02:52.550> it's<00:02:52.670> through<00:02:52.900> there's<00:02:53.900> no

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
as you can see it's through there's no

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.670 
as you can see it's through there's no
water<00:02:54.260> penetrated<00:02:54.920> down<00:02:55.100> eight<00:02:55.310> yet<00:02:56.680> so

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
water penetrated down eight yet so

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.120 
water penetrated down eight yet so
that's<00:02:57.860> that<00:02:58.040> done<00:02:59.140> so<00:03:00.140> what<00:03:00.560> I've<00:03:00.650> also<00:03:00.800> got

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
that's that done so what I've also got

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.780 
that's that done so what I've also got
here<00:03:01.250> I've<00:03:01.880> got<00:03:02.150> a<00:03:02.180> little<00:03:02.890> implement<00:03:03.890> to

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
here I've got a little implement to

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.120 
here I've got a little implement to
scoop<00:03:05.300> the<00:03:05.450> seeds<00:03:05.600> of<00:03:06.110> a<00:03:06.350> protoplasts<00:03:06.890> out<00:03:06.980> of

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
scoop the seeds of a protoplasts out of

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:08.830 
scoop the seeds of a protoplasts out of
the<00:03:07.190> tube<00:03:07.430> and<00:03:07.910> another<00:03:08.300> one<00:03:08.450> at<00:03:08.540> this<00:03:08.660> end

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
the tube and another one at this end

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.440 
the tube and another one at this end
which<00:03:09.140> is<00:03:09.290> like<00:03:09.410> a<00:03:09.440> diamond<00:03:09.920> shape<00:03:10.450> spinner

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
which is like a diamond shape spinner

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:12.940 
which is like a diamond shape spinner
shape<00:03:11.720> and<00:03:12.020> that's<00:03:12.200> for<00:03:12.440> picking<00:03:12.770> up<00:03:12.860> the

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
shape and that's for picking up the

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.010 
shape and that's for picking up the
individuals<00:03:13.520> and<00:03:13.790> depositing<00:03:14.360> them<00:03:14.480> on<00:03:14.600> the

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
individuals and depositing them on the

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.850 
individuals and depositing them on the
surface<00:03:15.200> of<00:03:15.410> the<00:03:15.560> compost<00:03:16.430> now<00:03:17.300> to<00:03:17.360> do<00:03:17.630> this<00:03:17.870> so

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
surface of the compost now to do this so

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.770 
surface of the compost now to do this so
that<00:03:19.010> you<00:03:19.070> can<00:03:19.220> see<00:03:19.430> easier<00:03:19.880> got<00:03:20.450> a<00:03:20.480> sheet<00:03:20.690> of

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
that you can see easier got a sheet of

I'm going to get out these little

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:55.970 
I'm going to get out these little
protocols

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.860 

many<00:04:00.760> of<00:04:00.820> them<00:04:02.910> so<00:04:03.910> now<00:04:03.940> I'm<00:04:04.330> gonna<00:04:04.480> do<00:04:04.690> I'm

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
many of them so now I'm gonna do I'm

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.260 
many of them so now I'm gonna do I'm
gonna<00:04:04.930> use<00:04:05.140> the<00:04:05.320> other<00:04:05.350> end<00:04:05.940> and<00:04:06.940> I'm<00:04:07.120> gonna

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:07.270 
gonna use the other end and I'm gonna

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:22.879 
gonna use the other end and I'm gonna
pick<00:04:07.480> up<00:04:07.600> a<00:04:08.760> seedling<00:04:10.260> or<00:04:11.260> a<00:04:11.320> bomb

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:26.340 

and<00:04:23.889> then<00:04:24.040> I'm<00:04:24.130> gonna<00:04:24.930> hopefully<00:04:25.930> you<00:04:26.050> can<00:04:26.139> see

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
and then I'm gonna hopefully you can see

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.860 
and then I'm gonna hopefully you can see
this<00:04:26.560> deposit<00:04:27.070> this<00:04:27.250> on<00:04:28.120> the<00:04:28.300> surface<00:04:28.540> of<00:04:28.750> the

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
this deposit this on the surface of the

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:37.510 
this deposit this on the surface of the
compost<00:04:30.360> you<00:04:31.360> see<00:04:31.570> that

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:43.550 

I'm<00:04:38.520> just<00:04:39.080> pocketed<00:04:40.759> another<00:04:42.319> now<00:04:43.319> what<00:04:43.470> I'm

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
I'm just pocketed another now what I'm

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.850 
I'm just pocketed another now what I'm
aiming<00:04:43.740> to<00:04:44.039> do<00:04:44.250> with<00:04:44.880> these<00:04:45.380> it's<00:04:46.380> probably

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
aiming to do with these it's probably

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.379 
aiming to do with these it's probably
get<00:04:47.069> about<00:04:48.030> four<00:04:48.479> or<00:04:48.630> five<00:04:50.120> now<00:04:51.120> what<00:04:51.300> you

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389 
get about four or five now what you

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:53.809 
get about four or five now what you
might<00:04:51.539> find<00:04:51.810> is<00:04:52.259> that<00:04:52.289> you<00:04:52.560> might<00:04:52.740> find<00:04:53.039> that

00:04:53.809 --> 00:04:53.819 
might find is that you might find that

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:55.939 
might find is that you might find that
the<00:04:54.539> seeds<00:04:54.810> don't<00:04:55.050> want<00:04:55.259> to<00:04:55.349> go<00:04:55.470> out<00:04:55.620> as

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:55.949 
the seeds don't want to go out as

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:57.890 
the seeds don't want to go out as
individuals<00:04:56.610> ought<00:04:57.090> to<00:04:57.210> come<00:04:57.360> out<00:04:57.479> as<00:04:57.690> a<00:04:57.720> small

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
individuals ought to come out as a small

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:04.430 
individuals ought to come out as a small
form<00:05:00.349> like<00:05:01.349> that<00:05:01.590> you'll<00:05:02.370> see<00:05:02.400> that<00:05:03.440> well

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
form like that you'll see that well

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.050 
form like that you'll see that well
that's<00:05:04.530> okay<00:05:04.949> just<00:05:05.190> what<00:05:05.460> you<00:05:05.550> can<00:05:05.610> do<00:05:05.819> is<00:05:05.940> just

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
that's okay just what you can do is just

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.180 
that's okay just what you can do is just
deposit<00:05:06.990> that<00:05:07.110> on<00:05:07.199> the<00:05:07.289> surface<00:05:07.500> then<00:05:07.979> give<00:05:08.130> it

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
deposit that on the surface then give it

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.990 
deposit that on the surface then give it
a<00:05:08.310> little<00:05:08.460> press<00:05:10.009> if<00:05:11.009> you<00:05:11.190> can<00:05:11.340> see<00:05:11.520> any<00:05:11.639> white

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
a little press if you can see any white

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.570 
a little press if you can see any white
groups<00:05:12.300> exposed<00:05:13.370> just<00:05:14.810> dug<00:05:15.810> it<00:05:15.930> all<00:05:16.110> back<00:05:16.580> do

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
groups exposed just dug it all back do

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.280 
groups exposed just dug it all back do
you<00:05:17.699> think

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:21.290 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:24.640 

and<00:05:21.830> there<00:05:21.980> they<00:05:22.070> are<00:05:22.100> on<00:05:22.310> the<00:05:22.430> surface<00:05:23.650> now

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
and there they are on the surface now

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.740 
and there they are on the surface now
what<00:05:24.950> I'm<00:05:25.010> gonna<00:05:25.160> do<00:05:25.370> now<00:05:26.110> if<00:05:27.110> you<00:05:27.410> think<00:05:27.710> that

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750 
what I'm gonna do now if you think that

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.970 
what I'm gonna do now if you think that
the<00:05:29.750> rules<00:05:29.960> are<00:05:30.080> not<00:05:30.170> making<00:05:30.380> contact<00:05:30.890> with

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:30.980 
the rules are not making contact with

over<00:05:41.590> the<00:05:42.590> little<00:05:42.860> protocols<00:05:43.370> you've<00:05:43.550> just

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:43.730 
over the little protocols you've just

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:45.850 
over the little protocols you've just
planted<00:05:44.120> and<00:05:44.270> that's<00:05:44.420> gonna<00:05:44.710> embed<00:05:45.710> them

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 
planted and that's gonna embed them

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.610 
planted and that's gonna embed them
around<00:05:46.160> the<00:05:46.910> soil<00:05:47.180> the<00:05:47.600> peat<00:05:48.080> around<00:05:48.440> them

around the soil the peat around them
roots<00:05:48.860> and<00:05:49.190> then<00:05:50.060> all<00:05:50.300> we<00:05:50.480> need<00:05:50.510> to<00:05:50.660> do

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:51.580 
roots and then all we need to do

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.640 
roots and then all we need to do
put<00:05:52.580> on<00:05:52.670> the<00:05:52.760> lid<00:05:52.960> that's<00:05:53.960> gonna<00:05:54.290> allow<00:05:54.380> oxygen

to do with that now is to real Abel it

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:08.440 
to do with that now is to real Abel it

philosophy on away you go now these ones

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.670 
philosophy on away you go now these ones
the<00:06:16.640> original<00:06:17.000> test<00:06:17.240> of<00:06:17.390> it<00:06:17.540> they're<00:06:18.470> growing

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:18.680 
the original test of it they're growing

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.020 
the original test of it they're growing
really<00:06:18.860> quickly<00:06:18.950> now<00:06:19.670> you<00:06:19.730> can<00:06:19.910> see

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:20.030 
really quickly now you can see

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:22.780 
really quickly now you can see
individual<00:06:20.720> leaves<00:06:20.930> on<00:06:21.140> these<00:06:21.580> these<00:06:22.580> are

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:22.790 
individual leaves on these these are

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:24.670 
individual leaves on these these are
more<00:06:22.910> clumped<00:06:23.330> together<00:06:23.390> so<00:06:24.110> they're<00:06:24.410> going

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:24.680 
more clumped together so they're going

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.140 
more clumped together so they're going
to<00:06:24.740> take<00:06:24.920> some<00:06:24.950> time<00:06:25.190> to<00:06:25.310> settle<00:06:25.520> but<00:06:25.970> I<00:06:26.030> would

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:26.150 
to take some time to settle but I would

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:27.370 
to take some time to settle but I would
think<00:06:26.300> within<00:06:26.510> within<00:06:26.960> a<00:06:27.020> month<00:06:27.200> they're

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:27.380 
think within within a month they're

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.620 
think within within a month they're
gonna<00:06:27.470> be<00:06:27.620> up<00:06:27.710> like<00:06:27.890> this<00:06:28.300> and<00:06:29.300> these<00:06:29.450> are

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:29.630 
gonna be up like this and these are

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.840 
gonna be up like this and these are
gonna<00:06:29.720> flower<00:06:30.250> probably<00:06:31.250> in<00:06:31.370> around<00:06:31.640> three

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:31.850 
gonna flower probably in around three

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.210 
gonna flower probably in around three
years<00:06:32.060> so<00:06:32.960> you<00:06:33.020> can<00:06:33.410> leave<00:06:33.590> the<00:06:33.800> plants<00:06:34.100> in

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:34.220 
years so you can leave the plants in

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:38.260 
years so you can leave the plants in
this<00:06:34.400> chilled<00:06:35.770> for<00:06:36.770> at<00:06:36.890> least<00:06:36.980> six<00:06:37.880> months<00:06:38.180> or

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:38.270 
this chilled for at least six months or

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:40.120 
this chilled for at least six months or
so<00:06:38.420> and<00:06:38.690> then<00:06:39.290> you<00:06:39.320> should<00:06:39.590> be<00:06:39.710> able<00:06:39.800> to<00:06:39.920> pop

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.130 
so and then you should be able to pop

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:41.110 
so and then you should be able to pop
them<00:06:40.280> out<00:06:40.400> if<00:06:40.550> your<00:06:40.640> be<00:06:40.700> large<00:06:40.880> enough<00:06:40.970> to

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.120 
them out if your be large enough to

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.880 
them out if your be large enough to
bottom<00:06:41.450> out<00:06:41.570> individually<00:06:42.200> into<00:06:42.320> little<00:06:42.680> six

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:42.890 
bottom out individually into little six

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:45.640 
bottom out individually into little six
centimeter<00:06:43.280> pots<00:06:43.630> in<00:06:44.630> a<00:06:44.720> way<00:06:44.870> you<00:06:44.930> go<00:06:45.140> from

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:45.650 
centimeter pots in a way you go from

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:46.720 
centimeter pots in a way you go from
four<00:06:45.800> it'll<00:06:46.010> be<00:06:46.070> enough<00:06:46.250> three<00:06:46.430> years<00:06:46.640> from

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:46.730 
four it'll be enough three years from
