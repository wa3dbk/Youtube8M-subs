00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.410
 hello youtube if tricks 1000 and good I did 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.410
 a trick in gt5 online in the version 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.720
 1.18 to be in the first person 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:23.050
 We will be in first person in 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.640
 playstation 3 and xbox 360 with which is 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.949
 a trick that is old but still 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.019
 is worth working and this more than anything 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:30.400
 I go up for people who do not remember or 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:32.619
 People who want to try more or less 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.780
 as it is the first person it is worth not 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.880
 It is very similar to the 100 but next 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.590
 something similar so well I'm going to 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.510
 say how it is done 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.980
 and good to simply begin what 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.560
 let's do it's going to be going to the Ferris wheel 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.220
 it's worth beating the location on the map 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.380
 they set moving in our application 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.290
 which is right on the beach is worth 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.730
 then good will come to a Ferris wheel 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.559
 that we are on the Ferris wheel we are approaching 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.629
 the strong one we are going to give to the little arrow 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:59.270
 right and quickly basauri the button 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.470
 bat and we're going to commit suicide 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.030
 we will do will be to buy a 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.729
 entrance for the Ferris wheel and quickly 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.710
 committing suicide so the dirt is not 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.390
 we will automatically appear in the 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.790
 beach is worth it and what we are going to do is going to 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.229
 be and back to the roller coaster now 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.720
 no memory now you have to go to the mountain 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:17.060
 Russian and wait for it to arrive is worth it 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.320
 case that is already mount me in my case 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.880
 as you can see the roller coaster not 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.040
 It was my turn to wait a little bit for 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.210
 that put it in fast camera and you can 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.610
 see that here comes what is the mountain 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.040
 Russian then well we're just going to 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.479
 get on the roller coaster is worth again 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.280
 with the right happiness we will climb 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.200
 and you can see that we are already uploaded 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.140
 inside and automatically it's going to 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.330
 put the camera on what the ferris wheel is 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.950
 ok then with the back button we can 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.690
 change of view voucher we have a view 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.160
 to see the norias from afar and other 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.470
 view to see the ferris wheel by 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.620
 before it's worth and you can just put 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.390
 what you 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.010
 I recommend you to put the one that is 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.540
 roller coaster from afar to be able to see 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.880
 when the roller coaster reaches its 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.440
 destination that as you can see then with 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.380
 fast camera and so it goes much faster 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.760
 we do not have to wait for then 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.470
 how many minutes it takes to arrive 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.060
 then well you can see that it has already 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.280
 arrived just here and we're going to 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.020
 download automatically is going to be 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.300
 arrive and our character is going to come down 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.800
 and how can you automatically see the 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.110
 coming down from the roller coaster we will be 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.820
 First person is worth in case 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.230
 you still see what the view of the 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.550
 roller coaster or the Ferris wheel is 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.770
 simply you are going to give back to 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.810
 back button and it hides automatically 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.670
 in the first person, and now 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.490
 we will simply take a car and we can 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.830
 see what good looks a very bad thing is 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.810
 that when we walk we look like a robot 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.760
 ok we want a little bit of the camera and 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.980
 the tour as it has like three turns 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.600
 different vouchers we can not walk with a 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.000
 normal person since I want very much 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.470
 the camera is the same as a robot and as 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.880
 you can see the car is controlled a lot 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.650
 better than walking since walking 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.780
 we can take weapons worth unfortunately 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.920
 weapons can not be removed but what 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.530
 What are we going to do? 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.090
 car and drive it well there are cars 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.040
 that get very low in the camera and not 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.870
 we can see well what is the face 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.099
 as the car has just caught 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.019
 before I put it in fast camera 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:00.090
 but there are quite a few cars that look 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.579
 perfectly so good to youtube 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.560
 like to comment and subscribe and they are 500 what 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:06.750
 arranged true dipper would be perfect as well 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.280
 good goodbye a pity that has the 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.599
 trick is that if we move far away from 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.819
 here we are going to take away what is the 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.819
 first person is worth so goodbye
