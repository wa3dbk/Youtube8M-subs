00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
to the car then yes because you don't

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:41.719 
to the car then yes because you don't

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
loaded the trailer and it would tip if

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.590

it depending on where the load is you

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.600 
it depending on where the load is you

birdie<00:04:50.640> told<00:04:50.760> me<00:04:51.120> although<00:04:51.600> it's<00:04:51.780> very<00:04:52.050> simple

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
birdie told me although it's very simple

birdie told me although it's very simple
to<00:04:52.530> use<00:04:52.560> it's<00:04:53.040> actually<00:04:53.310> quite<00:04:53.490> difficult<00:04:53.880> to

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
to use it's actually quite difficult to

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.680 
to use it's actually quite difficult to
reverse<00:04:54.570> or<00:04:55.080> maneuver<00:04:55.700> saatchi<00:04:56.700> I'm<00:04:57.330> afraid

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
reverse or maneuver saatchi I'm afraid

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.960 
reverse or maneuver saatchi I'm afraid
it<00:04:57.840> is<00:04:58.080> it's<00:04:59.010> impossible<00:04:59.400> and<00:04:59.820> cannot<00:05:00.030> be<00:05:00.180> done

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
it is it's impossible and cannot be done

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.969 
it is it's impossible and cannot be done
and<00:05:02.970> it's<00:05:03.300> better<00:05:03.540> to<00:05:03.810> uncouple<00:05:04.169> and<00:05:04.530> wheel<00:05:04.830> it

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 
and it's better to uncouple and wheel it

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:07.190 
and it's better to uncouple and wheel it
to<00:05:05.160> where<00:05:05.310> you<00:05:05.340> want<00:05:05.580> it<00:05:05.700> to<00:05:05.760> be<00:05:05.880> and<00:05:06.240> then<00:05:06.870> re

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.200 
to where you want it to be and then re

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.290 
to where you want it to be and then re
couple<00:05:07.560> up<00:05:07.650> after<00:05:07.979> you've<00:05:08.130> done<00:05:08.280> that<00:05:08.340> really

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
couple up after you've done that really

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.980 
couple up after you've done that really
absolutely<00:05:10.020> because<00:05:10.650> the<00:05:11.039> trailer<00:05:11.400> will<00:05:11.700> turn
