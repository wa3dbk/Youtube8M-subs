00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.890
 in the midst of the Paulistas and now residents of victory on the anniversary of the 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.799
 ostv city first edition was to seek testimonials impressions depending on 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:12.799
 other states to work or study here 

00:00:16.749 --> 00:00:19.689
 to take 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:22.609
 the bay 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:25.550
 the weather 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.550
 the culture 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.060
 beauties composing victory 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.970
 air 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.970
 characteristics that bring more and more Brazilians 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:50.210
 with the miner he lives here for almost a year he fell in love with the city yet 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.950
 when I was on the plane 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:53.879
 the sky 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.360
 This is not what we're talking about shining. 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.700
 then there was a man arriving there near the airport and on top of it, 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.700
 arrives on the beach then you see the beach there javey 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.829
 f 

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:10.359
 some points of the city that have attracted me a lot of attention too 

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:12.690
 ana carolina miners are wrong 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.260
 confirming what seems a unanimous beach, right? 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.630
 the edge of the beach avenue to enter has nothing 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.899
 nothing to do that is for a career 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:26.700
 tamara school makes a hike many a girl was 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.020
 the speaker the foot 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.509
 be only eight months in the city long enough to decide how it is 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.740
 that he wants to stay for the rest of his life. 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.430
 wins and program producer 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.380
 many freaks this was born right here in victory 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.330
 often does not have a time to value 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.590
 everything the city has to offer 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.820
 just talk a little with these people who come from other places 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.420
 to discover the true meaning of an expression they do not get tired of 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.140
 say to look for 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.820
 and to find here the quality of life of victory but I'm only school 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.159
 then take the children home initially 

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:11.159
 is a big fan of debt 

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:16.739
 however the traffic is on account of a city of contrasts of two years 

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:22.259
 it seems that everything has changed at the same time I feel good even though the deadline 

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:25.569
 validity of large cities but at the same time members of the 

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:30.930
 the document on mobility in large capitals oo new 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.870
 in communion with the 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.370
 just before the break in a bar where people still have an act of going out to 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.749
 street to talk to the really smallest city 

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:44.119
 but it is a city that it is really developing have 

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:46.720
 it really contradicts itself however 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.230
 that materializes in economic growth gives to feel the city if 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.609
 to develop has price nor for everything that is side 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:56.419
 I want to know about that. 

00:02:56.419 --> 00:03:00.559
 a few we will import an example I am not very close yet in the questions of 

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:02.889
 its strategy of involvement with events 

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:05.939
 and here we can see this in all aspects 

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:09.229
 However 

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:12.389
 which reflects the desire to be part of all this 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.599
 and never leave again a poll 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:17.809
 but nothing 

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:21.519
 there is no meaning the intention is to continue here 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.069
 time - said 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.069
 then 75% 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:31.329
 to win
