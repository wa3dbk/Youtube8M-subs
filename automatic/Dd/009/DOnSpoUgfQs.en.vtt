00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
together right in here we have our

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.830 
together right in here we have our
gelatine<00:01:33.520> leaves<00:01:33.550> soaked<00:01:34.300> in<00:01:34.510> very<00:01:34.690> cold

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
water and we just squeeze out the water

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.540 
water and we just squeeze out the water
which<00:01:37.480> is<00:01:37.510> adding<00:01:38.020> the<00:01:38.200> gelatine<00:01:38.980> now<00:01:39.160> to<00:01:39.220> the

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
which is adding the gelatine now to the

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.810 
which is adding the gelatine now to the
heavy<00:01:40.030> cream<00:01:40.560> rum<00:01:41.560> of<00:01:41.770> course<00:01:42.130> very<00:01:42.400> important
