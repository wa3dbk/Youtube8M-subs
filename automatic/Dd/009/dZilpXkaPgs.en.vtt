00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:08.050
 good here this this explanatory video 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:11.169
 for all the people that have been good 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:15.490
 added to the page leaving us days and 

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:17.290
 classes and well let's try to of 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.680
 apoco this being little all orders 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:25.000
 including a recurring petition 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:27.120
 was I want to learn to play some samba 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.140
 some chacarera 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:32.580
 we refer to folklore and logically 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:36.120
 on the guitar, take my first steps 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:39.540
 with the instrument in that good genre 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.540
 for them we are going to design this video 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.820
 that does not really point so much to the 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.410
 left hand but to the right hand what 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.620
 what is important to know inside the 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.770
 Folkloric genre at the time of playing 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.480
 this instrument is that the rhythms are 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.680
 pretty similar for changing the 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.140
 names of the genre but are rather to 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.480
 structural level at dance level but not 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.670
 at a technical level there are not many 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.980
 too many variants although there's no 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.570
 someone out there who knows knows a lot about 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.580
 matter can say good you're not 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.340
 wrong the truth is that 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.980
 mostly there is not much difference 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:19.260
 at least technically in hand 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:22.170
 right if in each region of our 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.780
 country one can clearly notice that there 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.970
 differences when touching the 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.700
 instrument but the truth that for 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.770
 someone who just started seems to me that 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.579
 no no no notices 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.409
 that's fine with the technique, it's not 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.030
 too significant for everyone 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.979
 that we just started to instrument 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.439
 first talk about the left hand I'm going to 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.750
 play on three tones the least natural 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.640
 I know that I agree that I form the pulses 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:52.079
 very important from the fifth string 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.670
 I will use less than this and my greater than 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.079
 actually the ideal for what it is 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.990
 popular music should play a 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:01.140
 dominant that equals a major mi 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.170
 seventh that would be taking out the three finger 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:08.610
 from that of the fourth string of one of two 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:11.190
 three fingers would be there and he took from the 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.110
 sixth installment I will use those three chords 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.819
 in the song but good how hard is it going to 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.319
 be in the right hand 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.340
 what I want to do with the guitar 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:23.920
 first let's start with a samba 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:28.819
 is to emulate the blows of the percussion of 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:32.540
 bombo of the leggo bombo that has according to 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:34.280
 they have 22 blows partially a hype or 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.950
 is the patch hit that would be hit 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.799
 serious that I'm going to try to emulate 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.379
 playing the bass part of the instrument and 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:44.390
 then we have the hoop blow that 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:46.549
 it would be part of the brightness the sharp part 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.080
 of the rhythm in this case there comes the 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:51.019
 part harder because I'm going to use 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:54.790
 the click is said click that is a 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:58.130
 pretty hard percussive blow of 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.870
 start playing because we see them is a 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.579
 little technique here with the hand 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.040
 right I have to touch I have to 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:05.480
 open my fingers in the first hours 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.870
 of the guitar make the first possible 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:11.120
 the second one is something quite difficult to 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:14.150
 aim but over time it goes it goes 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.950
 accommodating this think that I expose 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.160
 my fingers on the first strings of 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.800
 instrument and with the palm with peace 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.050
 from my right hand what I do if I am 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:27.230
 left-handed is going to be the opposite logically 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:29.600
 I'm going to hit the part where the 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:32.290
 bridge of the instrument with the part 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.799
 serious then he will do this 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:40.000
 see it hit from the inside out 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:43.420
 he turned around I insist on forgiveness from outside 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.489
 inward hit on the strings almost 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.170
 on the bridge of the instrument and 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:50.140
 time to hit exactly the same 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:54.930
 moment released my fingers 1 1 2 and 3 of the 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.930
 right hand generating this 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.950
 suddenly it will replace what 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:06.040
 we know how to hit and good 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:08.620
 properly click the rhythm of 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.840
 samba mostly I'm going to play 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.430
 with the thumb first I'm going to put a 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.959
 chord I will play the minor all the 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.470
 I'll pace is consistent draw on 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:20.950
 effect and I will build the same with 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.900
 the right hand first notice them I'm going 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.400
 happening in time more variants 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.680
 rhythmic but let's start with a 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.050
 simpler in the conservatory it 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:31.389
 will teach the famous punch a punch pointed 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:35.710
 that does not go for me anymore and does not reflect 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:38.110
 nothing what can sound professionally 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:42.340
 the pace is out there is much more 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:44.650
 Look like clay 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.210
 the thumb all the strings that I 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.270
 let's play chords from the fifth one towards 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.150
 down 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:53.850
 and then I'll make the pasted blows 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:57.350
 that is going to be a thumbs up and a 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:05:01.100
 thumb down or down 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:03.850
 I wait up down, we go with that 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.850
 first sequence 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:13.219
 ok we live let's go back 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:14.749
 when I raise with the thumb only 

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:17.349
 put the first strings of 

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:17.349
 instrument 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:25.110
 when I play down there I can play 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:25.110
 more notes I told myself to play chords 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.910
 now the controversial one is going to come 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.910
 click 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:37.410
 there would not be a single time and then I'll 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:41.310
 finish my compass with a stroke of 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:42.910
 thumb down we touch 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.690
 two 

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:48.180
 another one 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:52.100
 4 more 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.100
 or not 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:06:00.009
 do not 

00:05:55.059 --> 00:06:02.749
 we started really slow when the 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:05.179
 chord for now I'll do it without 

00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:06.800
 share chords within same compass 

00:06:05.179 --> 00:06:11.539
 I'm going to play a compass or brigade where 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:16.429
 be for batman in exchange for chord I will 

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:19.669
 move now to re minor that is played 

00:06:16.429 --> 00:06:23.059
 to differentiate from the fourth string 

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:25.219
 then go to my seventh largest this 

00:06:23.059 --> 00:06:27.889
 dominant that I will touch from the 

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:30.979
 sixth string and I'm going to finish a cycle 

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:33.819
 of four measures on the minor and there 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:33.819
 we have already 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:38.990
 First 

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.990
 do not 

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:47.039
 i 

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:47.039
 I think back 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.620
 do not 

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.730
 well this is the explanatory video 

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:59.800
 we started with the weapons I hope that they 

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:01.660
 I liked it, I hope it serves you and 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:04.800
 good if you add two requests to 

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.800
 our channel many thanks
