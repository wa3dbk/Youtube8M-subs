00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:29.640 
film is concerned so it has to be viable

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.270 
film is concerned so it has to be viable
so<00:05:30.630> if<00:05:30.780> somebody<00:05:31.170> who<00:05:31.560> have<00:05:31.680> whether<00:05:31.920> it<00:05:32.070> is<00:05:32.160> in

the world gets paid a certain amount

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.500 
the world gets paid a certain amount
that<00:05:35.100> means<00:05:35.340> that<00:05:35.490> the<00:05:35.580> project<00:05:35.970> is<00:05:36.120> becoming
