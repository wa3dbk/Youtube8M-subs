right here now the reason I might want

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.460 
right here now the reason I might want
to<00:01:37.880> do<00:01:38.000> this<00:01:38.149> is<00:01:38.390> it's<00:01:38.780> easier<00:01:39.110> for<00:01:39.320> me<00:01:39.440> to

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
to do this is it's easier for me to

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.469 
to do this is it's easier for me to
reach<00:01:39.770> it<00:01:39.979> and<00:01:40.070> I<00:01:40.310> can<00:01:40.490> actually<00:01:40.640> save<00:01:41.119> this

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
reach it and I can actually save this

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.770 
reach it and I can actually save this
preset<00:01:42.110> height<00:01:42.670> by<00:01:43.670> just<00:01:43.970> pushing<00:01:44.600> and

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
preset height by just pushing and

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.150

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
you this is now set as a preset height

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.930 
you this is now set as a preset height
so<00:02:00.470> I<00:02:00.530> can<00:02:00.800> lower<00:02:01.009> it<00:02:01.190> all<00:02:01.310> the<00:02:01.340> way<00:02:01.490> by<00:02:01.670> pushing
