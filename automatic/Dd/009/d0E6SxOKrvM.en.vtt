painted but I heard that powder coating

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:46.699 
painted but I heard that powder coating
is<00:02:44.909> a<00:02:44.969> hundred<00:02:45.299> times<00:02:45.510> better<00:02:45.719> so<00:02:46.530> I'm<00:02:46.620> gonna

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
is a hundred times better so I'm gonna

is a hometown fans impatient absolutely
the<00:03:04.019> flexibility<00:03:04.650> factor<00:03:05.040> of<00:03:05.159> powder<00:03:05.400> the

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
the flexibility factor of powder the

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.550 
the flexibility factor of powder the
thickness<00:03:06.480> and<00:03:06.629> the<00:03:06.719> durability<00:03:07.079> against

thickness and the durability against

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.979 
thickness and the durability against
gravity<00:03:07.980> then<00:03:08.219> it<00:03:08.579> just<00:03:09.060> many<00:03:09.419> times<00:03:09.719> greater

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
gravity then it just many times greater

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.740 
gravity then it just many times greater

00:03:17.929 --> 00:03:17.939 
middle is out that's going to get flat

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:20.030 
middle is out that's going to get flat
okay<00:03:18.540> guys<00:03:18.780> on<00:03:19.019> the<00:03:19.169> clean<00:03:19.379> metal<00:03:19.650> well<00:03:19.949> then

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
okay guys on the clean metal well then

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.020 
okay guys on the clean metal well then
we're<00:03:20.129> going<00:03:20.250> to<00:03:20.310> prep<00:03:20.489> it<00:03:20.639> make<00:03:20.819> sure<00:03:20.849> that

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
we're going to prep it make sure that

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.899 
we're going to prep it make sure that
it's<00:03:21.329> dust<00:03:21.569> free<00:03:21.870> and<00:03:22.019> there's<00:03:22.739> no<00:03:23.040> residue<00:03:23.549> on

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:23.909 
it's dust free and there's no residue on

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:25.610 
it's dust free and there's no residue on
it<00:03:24.090> memorial<00:03:24.599> and<00:03:25.079> then<00:03:25.260> it's<00:03:25.349> going<00:03:25.439> to<00:03:25.500> get

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
it memorial and then it's going to get

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:26.869 
it memorial and then it's going to get
ready<00:03:25.769> to<00:03:25.859> cook<00:03:26.040> it's<00:03:26.370> an<00:03:26.489> electrostatic

00:03:26.869 --> 00:03:26.879 
ready to cook it's an electrostatic

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:29.089 
ready to cook it's an electrostatic
process<00:03:27.569> basically<00:03:28.260> the<00:03:28.409> powder<00:03:28.620> is<00:03:28.799> charged

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 
process basically the powder is charged

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:31.069 
process basically the powder is charged
as<00:03:29.340> you<00:03:29.459> come<00:03:29.639> down<00:03:29.669> to<00:03:29.909> the<00:03:30.000> gun<00:03:30.209> the<00:03:30.510> piece<00:03:30.900> is

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
as you come down to the gun the piece is

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.080 
as you come down to the gun the piece is
grounded<00:03:31.560> which<00:03:31.949> gives<00:03:32.159> it<00:03:32.250> a<00:03:32.310> nice<00:03:32.430> even<00:03:32.849> coat

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
grounded which gives it a nice even coat

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.050 
grounded which gives it a nice even coat
and<00:03:33.780> it's<00:03:33.930> ready<00:03:34.109> to<00:03:34.139> bake<00:03:34.319> so<00:03:34.560> it<00:03:34.650> almost<00:03:34.829> like

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
and it's ready to bake so it almost like

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.369 
and it's ready to bake so it almost like
sucked<00:03:36.060> the<00:03:36.180> powder<00:03:36.419> coating<00:03:36.780> into<00:03:36.989> the<00:03:37.079> metal

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
sucked the powder coating into the metal

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:40.339 
sucked the powder coating into the metal
absolutely<00:03:37.949> so<00:03:38.819> you<00:03:38.879> have<00:03:39.090> a<00:03:39.120> kids<00:03:39.449> design

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
absolutely so you have a kids design

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:43.159 
absolutely so you have a kids design
Pete<00:03:40.620> for<00:03:40.949> dummies<00:03:41.280> don't<00:03:41.669> paint<00:03:41.970> it<00:03:42.169> powder

Pete for dummies don't paint it powder

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:46.309 
Pete for dummies don't paint it powder
