what<00:00:12.750> it<00:00:12.780> is<00:00:12.900> is<00:00:13.259> on<00:00:13.530> your<00:00:13.650> first<00:00:13.920> turn<00:00:14.330> when

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
what it is is on your first turn when

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.650 
what it is is on your first turn when
you<00:00:16.400> do<00:00:17.400> your<00:00:17.520> combo<00:00:17.880> if<00:00:18.090> you<00:00:18.180> time<00:00:18.390> it<00:00:18.420> right

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
you do your combo if you time it right

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.320 
you do your combo if you time it right
you<00:00:19.170> can<00:00:19.320> make<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.279> second<00:00:20.730> string<00:00:20.910> of<00:00:21.029> combo

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
you can make a second string of combo

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.810 
you can make a second string of combo
within<00:00:21.570> your<00:00:21.689> first<00:00:21.930> turn<00:00:22.230> so<00:00:22.650> they<00:00:23.490> gotta<00:00:23.699> do

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
within your first turn so they gotta do

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.070 
within your first turn so they gotta do
it<00:00:23.939> pretty<00:00:24.090> quick<00:00:24.410> but<00:00:25.410> it's<00:00:26.869> double<00:00:27.869> timing

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
it pretty quick but it's double timing

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:40.090 
it pretty quick but it's double timing
 ok<00:00:30.679> ok<00:00:31.679> so<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:31.980> this<00:00:32.130> one

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.979 

sometimes<00:00:41.000> it<00:00:41.120> glitches<00:00:41.329> up<00:00:41.600> and<00:00:41.780> then<00:00:41.870> your

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:41.989 
sometimes it glitches up and then your

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:43.840 
sometimes it glitches up and then your
whole<00:00:42.079> board<00:00:42.410> just<00:00:42.649> get<00:00:42.800> screwed<00:00:43.070> over<00:00:43.309> and

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
whole board just get screwed over and

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.790 
whole board just get screwed over and
it's<00:00:44.300> pretty<00:00:44.449> hard<00:00:44.660> to<00:00:44.719> finish<00:00:44.930> the<00:00:45.640> battle

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
it's pretty hard to finish the battle

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.000 
it's pretty hard to finish the battle
okay<00:00:48.800> this<00:00:49.539> okay<00:00:50.539> see<00:00:50.600> right<00:00:51.050> here<00:00:51.260> you<00:00:51.800> can

00:00:55.599 --> 00:00:55.609 
move pieces in the dark so I can move it

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:59.829 
move pieces in the dark so I can move it
right<00:00:55.760> now<00:00:56.000> and<00:00:57.370> it<00:00:58.370> will<00:00:58.399> do<00:00:59.120> the<00:00:59.239> combos<00:00:59.659> well

00:00:59.829 --> 00:00:59.839

as well so you can still see that

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.889 
as well so you can still see that
there's<00:01:04.489> points<00:01:04.820> going<00:01:04.970> on<00:01:05.180> there<00:01:05.539> oh<00:01:07.810> hang<00:01:08.810> on

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
let me see if I can get the glitch the

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:20.840 
let me see if I can get the glitch the
other<00:01:10.970> way<00:01:12.369> okay<00:01:15.009> frak

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.469

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
people play at the finger but I'm just

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:40.290 
people play at the finger but I'm just
really<00:01:29.190> used<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.400> using<00:01:30.060> my<00:01:30.270> thumb

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.250 

frag<00:01:41.290> I<00:01:41.910> might<00:01:42.910> have<00:01:43.120> to<00:01:43.150> time<00:01:43.390> it<00:01:43.420> right<00:01:43.600> every

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 
frag I might have to time it right every

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.740 
frag I might have to time it right every
single<00:01:44.530> time<00:01:44.680> but<00:01:45.010> it<00:01:45.850> is<00:01:46.030> a<00:01:46.060> glitch<00:01:46.330> and<00:01:46.600> I'm

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
single time but it is a glitch and I'm

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.860 
single time but it is a glitch and I'm
pretty<00:01:47.440> sure<00:01:47.560> it's<00:01:47.800> not<00:01:48.750> supposed<00:01:49.750> to<00:01:49.810> be

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:49.870 
pretty sure it's not supposed to be

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.120 
pretty sure it's not supposed to be
there<00:01:50.490> so<00:01:52.050> probably<00:01:53.050> don't<00:01:53.350> use<00:01:53.530> this<00:01:53.740> but<00:01:54.100> uh

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
there so probably don't use this but uh

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.810 
there so probably don't use this but uh
hopefully<00:01:54.820> penny<00:01:55.330> fixes<00:01:55.780> it<00:01:56.550> no<00:01:57.550> there's

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
hopefully penny fixes it no there's
