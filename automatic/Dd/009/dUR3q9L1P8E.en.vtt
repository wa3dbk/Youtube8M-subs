00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 hello everybody, it's tiago sore popcorn, come on 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.660
 learn how to cook pasta start 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.840
 putting enough water in a pan 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.969
 large , preferably if you have a 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.469
 for pasta that already comes with the 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.780
 drainer inside 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.619
 make more or less the bill of a liter 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.810
 of water for every 150 grams of pasta 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:25.199
 estimated at approximately 80 grams of 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.539
 raw mass good person a pack of 500 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.560
 would give to approximately six 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.289
 people 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.160
 put a good spoon of salt and wait 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.680
 boil 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.670
 so it is already boiling spread 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.129
 well the pasta 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.920
 here I am using the payers but this 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.989
 serves any type of dough waits 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.930
 it's soft bottom to power 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.090
 accommodate the rest need not put 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.309
 oil or olive oil in water 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.110
 use tweezers to help spread the 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.110
 noodles avoiding it grid 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.149
 be aware of the cooking time in the 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.440
 Each package has its own 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.899
 I kept moving from time to time to 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.430
 prevent sticking 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.500
 We spent the time to take a thread 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.939
 approve and make sure the pasta 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.210
 It's already over 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.400
 at the point how it should be fully cooked 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.400
 but offering a light resistance 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.400
 bite the ideal is to choose the pasta and 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.920
 already put directly in the eye but case 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.930
 It's only for later to let him 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.820
 Quiet and time to serve 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.130
 dive into hot water again 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.299
 only to warm and release the 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.159
 pasta one of the ten seconds 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:36.869
 now you will have a 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.759
 perfect every time 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.900
 I hope you have learned and good 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.119
 appetite 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.040
 and then liked it because how easy it is after 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.630
 mouth water, so stop checking 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.030

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.229

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.540
 home sharing we earn more 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.159
 because it greatly encourages 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.079
 People keep making new videos for 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.509
 You may not seem to make a difference. 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.159
 but it helps us a lot if there is any 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.020
