00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:06.769
 very good everything is worth here is to ask and 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.570
 commenting how ya javier so beautiful 5 

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:10.280
 online and I come to bring you a speculation 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.960
 is that it's coming out on getafe did 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.210
 see who is going to create it about where 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.950
 is going to create and well they told me that there 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.869
 new news that some 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.060
 speculations that rockstar north 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.890
 ok it's working now join face 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.869
 to play four teams one good 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.000
 tell you that nothing is confirmed but 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:29.630
 it is a hypothesis after discovering 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.460
 it is speculated that we rockstar north already 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.980
 is working people to face to play 4 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.589
 and xbox one you know you have not left 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.559
 gta 5 for play four team one but 

00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:40.670
 they are the next generation consoles 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.199
 tell you that there is nothing confirmed worth 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.269
 but it is a hypothesis after 

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:45.499
 discover that the failure 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:48.109
 developer is looking for a 

00:00:45.499 --> 00:00:50.449
 programmer in charge of creating 

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:52.370
 a main motor worth means that the 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:53.709
 creator vale are looking for someone 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.530
 to work on the main engine 

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:59.209
 dgt makes good I can tell you that it is 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.709
 very soon still to pull out together 

00:00:59.209 --> 00:01:03.170
 since they have taken five years to remove 

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:04.040
 the gta 5 is a very well sold game already 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.170
 I know 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.480
 but I do not think that they also take gta 6 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.810
 for the playstation 3 the team 360 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:14.360
 because they are consoles because they are already 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.410
 working seem to work but I 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.910
 I think oil so they have removed it 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.020
 a little bit of graphics has taken away a 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.490
 little bit of something to go 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.920
 working well already as modern games 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.360
 in a game that the console was going well 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.430
 but it costs them a little bit of time in 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.320
 when the maps load us well and good 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.290
 I think you're going to bring it 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.970
 only for play 4 and xbox one since 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.190
 a console that are new and our 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.780
 nothing will print yet I imagine that this 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.820
 game I do not know when it will come out I need 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.000
 your opinion is what do you think if I 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.520
 I know it's an interview with a car dj 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.770
 book and one such dj who has hired him 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.259
 to work on some songs 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.820
 to work in a game from do and 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.410
 so said office or I made a 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.790
 interview and he went a little bit of the 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.970
 tongue said he was working gta 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.470
 face did not do a marketing guy 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.210
 commercial worth to try 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.800
 Promote people to face to try 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.720
 of being able to sell so that people are 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.920
 more pending to it but good is what 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.930
 that I tell you I'll leave you in the description 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.860
 the news that I am reading that is 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.810
 of February 28 and well 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.520
 hypothesis I created this oil to play 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.310
 four teams one is also said that 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.670
 will be able to develop in liberty 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.290
 city 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.550
 liberty city as you know of the 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.720
 previous call of duty of the 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.310
 of gta since it is a map that does not 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.860
 there's so much forest worth there's not much 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.780
 good travel there I leave it worth 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.060
 you think the comments say 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.980
 that what matters to us especially what 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.980
 it says rockstar what what we 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.380
 it matters especially for the requirements 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.580
 looking for the developer of this game 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.140
 you need at least to have three years of 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.390
 experience of commercial eggs and how 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.890
 minimum one egg games published on play 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.780
 3 and team this means that 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.730
 they need developers that already 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.650
 have developed key games since 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.750
 they are not going to put in anybody and good 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.970
 rockstar north is the developer of 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.700
 gta 5 and 7 to 4 so it will be surely 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.230
 the one in charge of this oil that they look for 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.160
 someone to create engines and systems 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.230
 for consoles after like 4 team one 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.840
 it could well mean that they are already in 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.550
 the next dt aimar be I hope that what 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.290
 take out for play 4 and for teams one already 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.719
 that a console 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.689
 because there is practically very little 

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:18.290
 game of a caliber like gta face vale 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:21.000
 what could be the bomb 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.100
 5 many things have already changed 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.110
 changed I do not know how 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.940
 it is possible that for you have to leave 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:29.790
 they can now put the 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.070
 timeshare is the tlc 1.6 not me 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.750
 I already imagine in ugt a face what is what 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.850
 can bring us can not enter then no 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.770
 to have a family to have type the 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.110
 five we can have children we can have 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:43.290
 a job because there are good uses rodeos 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.880
 that could do a pizza on the 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.950
 adaptation of her 5 to play four 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.560
 teams one although it 's less likely 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.020
 because rockstar north never takes care 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.120
 directly from those things it is worth saying 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:57.240
 which is very very likely that we have 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.620
 from you do to play 4 xbox one very 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.940
 very close way without anything coming out 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.380
 I hope you liked the news already 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.870
 you know that you can give him live and want 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:07.230
 efe gta iv for xbox one for play 3 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.890
 Xbox 360 or play 4 me and put it the 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.420
 comments 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.100
