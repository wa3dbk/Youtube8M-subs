00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
exciting so the title of the next DLC is

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.290 
exciting so the title of the next DLC is
rumored<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.270> be<00:00:33.390> called<00:00:33.960> Red<00:00:34.559> Guard<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.300> the

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
rumored to be called Red Guard and the

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.270 
rumored to be called Red Guard and the
reason<00:00:36.600> for<00:00:36.630> this<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:37.200> because<00:00:37.280> bethesda

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
reason for this is because bethesda

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.970 
reason for this is because bethesda
softworks<00:00:38.430> filed<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.450> trademark<00:00:39.690> for<00:00:40.290> the

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980

title Red Guard back in March 2011 now

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.000 
title Red Guard back in March 2011 now
the<00:00:44.700> reason<00:00:45.059> it's<00:00:45.510> getting<00:00:45.960> exciting<00:00:46.590> now<00:00:46.620> is

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
the reason it's getting exciting now is

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.220 
the reason it's getting exciting now is
because<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.340> trademark<00:00:47.969> expires<00:00:48.750> in

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
because that trademark expires in

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.340 
because that trademark expires in
February<00:00:49.890> 2013<00:00:50.700> if<00:00:50.940> they<00:00:51.570> don't<00:00:51.719> declare<00:00:52.110> a

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
February 2013 if they don't declare a

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.270 
February 2013 if they don't declare a
use<00:00:52.559> for<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.920> title<00:00:53.390> so<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:55.010> expectation<00:00:56.010> is

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
use for the title so the expectation is

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.490 
use for the title so the expectation is
that<00:00:56.550> shortly<00:00:57.149> they<00:00:57.480> will<00:00:57.629> announce<00:00:57.989> a

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
that shortly they will announce a

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.880 
that shortly they will announce a
purpose<00:00:59.340> for<00:00:59.370> this<00:00:59.730> trademark<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.890> it's

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
purpose for this trademark and it's

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.319 
purpose for this trademark and it's
rumored<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.520> will<00:01:02.609> be<00:01:02.699> in<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:02.879> form<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.239> a

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
rumored that it will be in the form of a

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.590 
rumored that it will be in the form of a
DLC<00:01:03.780> so<00:01:04.350> with<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:04.799> title<00:01:05.129> Red<00:01:05.309> Guard<00:01:05.580> we<00:01:06.450> can

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
DLC so with the title Red Guard we can

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.560 
DLC so with the title Red Guard we can
probably<00:01:06.780> expect<00:01:07.100> the<00:01:08.100> DLC<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.790> take<00:01:08.970> place<00:01:09.210> in

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
probably expect the DLC to take place in

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.920 
probably expect the DLC to take place in
Hammerfell<00:01:10.110> which<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.799> home<00:01:11.640> area<00:01:12.299> of<00:01:12.570> the

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
Hammerfell which is the home area of the

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.560 
Hammerfell which is the home area of the
race<00:01:13.380> Red<00:01:13.710> Guard<00:01:14.000> so<00:01:15.000> perhaps<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.450> most

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
race Red Guard so perhaps the most

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.080 
race Red Guard so perhaps the most
obvious<00:01:15.900> place<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:17.310> we<00:01:17.430> would<00:01:17.610> visit<00:01:17.759> in

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
obvious place that we would visit in

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.510 
obvious place that we would visit in
this<00:01:18.330> DLC<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:19.820> the<00:01:20.820> city<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.270> dragon<00:01:21.840> star<00:01:22.080> and

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
this DLC is the city of dragon star and

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.490 
this DLC is the city of dragon star and
that<00:01:23.520> city<00:01:23.759> is<00:01:24.119> just<00:01:24.150> off<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.960> border<00:01:25.320> from

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
that city is just off the border from

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.590 
that city is just off the border from
skyrim<00:01:26.130> into<00:01:26.490> Hammerfell<00:01:26.970> so<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.330> seems

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
skyrim into Hammerfell so that seems

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.590 
skyrim into Hammerfell so that seems
quite<00:01:27.840> likely<00:01:27.869> also<00:01:28.970> they<00:01:29.970> could<00:01:30.150> adopt<00:01:30.420> a

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
quite likely also they could adopt a

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.109 
quite likely also they could adopt a
similar<00:01:31.020> style<00:01:31.409> that<00:01:31.680> they<00:01:31.770> did<00:01:32.030> with<00:01:33.030> the

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
similar style that they did with the

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.929 
similar style that they did with the
dragonborn<00:01:33.600> dlc<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:34.520> use<00:01:35.520> one<00:01:35.759> of<00:01:35.790> the

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
dragonborn dlc and use one of the

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.390 
dragonborn dlc and use one of the
islands<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.570> Hammerfell<00:01:37.020> as<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.920> central
