00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.580 
gonna be trickshotting this line that
I'm<00:01:33.060> looking<00:01:33.150> at<00:01:33.420> right<00:01:33.570> now<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:34.110> marks

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
where you fall off the map and basically

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.050 
where you fall off the map and basically
you<00:01:37.950> can<00:01:38.040> just<00:01:38.070> go<00:01:38.280> over<00:01:38.310> shots<00:01:38.579> down<00:01:38.790> here

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
you can just go over shots down here

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.120 
you can just go over shots down here
again<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:40.110> have<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.320> shoot<00:01:40.500> into<00:01:40.740> that<00:01:40.860> little

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
again you have to shoot into that little

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.340 
again you have to shoot into that little
box<00:01:41.340> that<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.850> bots<00:01:42.030> are<00:01:42.390> standing<00:01:42.930> in<00:01:43.079> so

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
box that the bots are standing in so

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.249 
box that the bots are standing in so
like<00:01:44.040> usual<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.490> have<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.729> example<00:01:45.689> shot<00:01:45.899> at<00:01:46.110> the

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259
