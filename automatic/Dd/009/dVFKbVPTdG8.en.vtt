sounds<00:03:34.180> absolutely<00:03:34.420> fantastic<00:03:34.780> to<00:03:35.680> me<00:03:35.860> but<00:03:36.070> I

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
sounds absolutely fantastic to me but I

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.460 
sounds absolutely fantastic to me but I
guess<00:03:36.310> I'll<00:03:36.490> let<00:03:36.580> you<00:03:36.820> guys<00:03:37.030> be<00:03:37.660> the<00:03:37.870> judge<00:03:37.900> of

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
guess I'll let you guys be the judge of

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.910 
guess I'll let you guys be the judge of
that

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
that

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.770

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
also there will be dancing involved in

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.300 
also there will be dancing involved in

this microphone test something that I

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:46.860 
this microphone test something that I
probably<00:03:45.580> should<00:03:46.060> have<00:03:46.090> warned<00:03:46.510> everyone

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
probably should have warned everyone

probably should have warned everyone
about<00:03:47.230> before<00:03:47.650> it<00:03:47.740> happened

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
about before it happened

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.390

little<00:04:20.290> bit<00:04:20.380> on<00:04:20.530> the<00:04:20.620> expensive<00:04:20.799> side<00:04:21.190> but<00:04:21.400> it

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
little bit on the expensive side but it

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:24.410 
little bit on the expensive side but it
sounds<00:04:22.150> great<00:04:22.390> and<00:04:22.840> frankly<00:04:23.590> for<00:04:23.770> the<00:04:23.830> target

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:24.420
