show you how to blend our powder

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:16.160 
show you how to blend our powder
pigments<00:00:12.960> into<00:00:13.889> your<00:00:14.039> resin<00:00:14.840> our<00:00:15.840> powder

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
pigments into your resin our powder

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.920 
pigments into your resin our powder
pigments<00:00:16.410> are<00:00:16.710> very<00:00:17.010> finely<00:00:17.400> ground<00:00:17.910> so<00:00:18.779> they

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
pigments are very finely ground so they

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.109 
pigments are very finely ground so they
blend<00:00:19.170> into<00:00:19.410> resin<00:00:19.980> very<00:00:20.220> nicely<00:00:20.460> and<00:00:20.940> what

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
blend into resin very nicely and what

I'm going to show you here today is a

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:24.259 
I'm going to show you here today is a
little<00:00:22.769> different<00:00:23.070> way<00:00:23.160> of<00:00:23.189> doing<00:00:23.429> it<00:00:23.699> you'll

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
little different way of doing it you'll

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.120 
little different way of doing it you'll
see<00:00:24.509> I'm<00:00:24.599> working<00:00:24.900> on<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:25.050> wax<00:00:25.259> paper<00:00:25.589> surface

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
see I'm working on a wax paper surface

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.540 
see I'm working on a wax paper surface
and<00:00:26.400> what<00:00:27.029> I'm<00:00:27.119> going<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.359> do<00:00:27.539> is<00:00:27.810> actually

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
and what I'm going to do is actually

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.759 
and what I'm going to do is actually
pour<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.970> little<00:00:30.720> bit<00:00:30.839> of<00:00:30.960> our<00:00:31.079> resin<00:00:31.439> onto<00:00:31.619> a

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
pour a little bit of our resin onto a

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.370 
pour a little bit of our resin onto a
wax<00:00:32.040> paper<00:00:32.250> surface<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:32.940> then<00:00:33.600> add<00:00:33.900> the

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
wax paper surface and then add the

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.360 
wax paper surface and then add the
powder<00:00:34.620> onto<00:00:35.010> it<00:00:36.710> this<00:00:37.710> is<00:00:37.949> going<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.160> be<00:00:38.250> your

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
powder onto it this is going to be your

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:45.020 
powder onto it this is going to be your
stock<00:00:38.610> solution<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:43.609> little<00:00:44.609> bit<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.879> this

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
stock solution a little bit of this

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:53.939 
stock solution a little bit of this
powder<00:00:45.329> goes<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.719> long<00:00:46.109> way

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:53.949 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:57.000 

so<00:00:54.489> you'll<00:00:54.609> need<00:00:54.789> just<00:00:54.820> a<00:00:55.149> little<00:00:55.179> tiny<00:00:55.839> bit<00:00:56.079> go

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
so you'll need just a little tiny bit go

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.369 
so you'll need just a little tiny bit go
ahead<00:00:57.070> and<00:00:57.250> sprinkle<00:00:57.640> it<00:00:57.789> on<00:00:57.969> top<00:00:58.289> there<00:00:59.289> you

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
ahead and sprinkle it on top there you

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.689 
ahead and sprinkle it on top there you
go<00:00:59.530> now<00:01:00.070> mix<00:01:00.370> it<00:01:00.579> in<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.890> I<00:01:02.979> think<00:01:03.339> doing<00:01:03.519> it

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
go now mix it in and I think doing it

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:05.490 
go now mix it in and I think doing it
here<00:01:03.969> on<00:01:04.149> the<00:01:04.269> wax<00:01:04.479> paper<00:01:04.689> on<00:01:04.839> a<00:01:04.960> flat<00:01:05.290> surface

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
here on the wax paper on a flat surface

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:14.160 
here on the wax paper on a flat surface
get<00:01:05.950> to<00:01:06.100> a<00:01:06.130> much<00:01:06.670> nicer<00:01:07.630> blend<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:12.899> then<00:01:13.899> this

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
get to a much nicer blend and then this

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:27.520 
get to a much nicer blend and then this
can<00:01:15.009> be<00:01:15.159> your<00:01:15.310> stock<00:01:15.580> solution

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.590 

and<00:01:27.710> then<00:01:28.190> the<00:01:28.310> best<00:01:28.460> part<00:01:28.580> after<00:01:29.060> you've<00:01:29.420> got

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
and then the best part after you've got

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.990 
and then the best part after you've got
this<00:01:29.750> blended<00:01:30.280> you<00:01:31.280> can<00:01:31.430> just<00:01:31.580> throw<00:01:31.700> your<00:01:31.790> wax

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
this blended you can just throw your wax

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.780 
this blended you can just throw your wax
paper<00:01:32.090> away<00:01:32.740> now<00:01:33.740> I've<00:01:33.920> also<00:01:34.100> done<00:01:34.400> this<00:01:34.580> with

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
paper away now I've also done this with

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.650 
paper away now I've also done this with
cups<00:01:35.120> and<00:01:35.360> trust<00:01:35.750> me<00:01:35.900> I<00:01:35.930> think<00:01:36.140> this<00:01:37.540> doing<00:01:38.540> it

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 
cups and trust me I think this doing it

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.950 
cups and trust me I think this doing it
on<00:01:38.780> a<00:01:38.810> flat<00:01:39.350> surface<00:01:39.670> plus<00:01:40.670> I<00:01:40.970> really<00:01:41.630> love<00:01:41.930> our

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
on a flat surface plus I really love our

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:48.350 
on a flat surface plus I really love our
stir<00:01:42.290> sticks<00:01:42.590> for<00:01:42.800> this

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.620 

there<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.110> go<00:01:49.260> blend<00:01:49.800> and<00:01:50.250> now<00:01:51.240> you've<00:01:51.390> got<00:01:51.600> a

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
there you go blend and now you've got a

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.770 
there you go blend and now you've got a
very<00:01:52.230> nice<00:01:52.440> stock<00:01:52.830> solution<00:01:53.370> and<00:01:53.580> you'll<00:01:54.300> you

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
very nice stock solution and you'll you

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.840 
very nice stock solution and you'll you
can<00:01:54.990> now<00:01:55.140> add<00:01:55.380> this<00:01:55.710> directly<00:01:56.370> into<00:01:56.670> your

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
can now add this directly into your

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.060 
can now add this directly into your
resin<00:01:57.360> now<00:01:57.900> if<00:01:58.020> this<00:01:58.170> isn't<00:01:58.380> as<00:01:58.590> dark<00:01:58.830> as<00:01:58.950> you

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
resin now if this isn't as dark as you

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.350 
resin now if this isn't as dark as you
would<00:01:59.250> like<00:01:59.370> you<00:01:59.580> can<00:01:59.700> add<00:01:59.760> a<00:01:59.910> little<00:02:00.180> bit<00:02:00.330> more

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
would like you can add a little bit more

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.270 
would like you can add a little bit more
powder<00:02:00.840> but<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.290> all<00:02:01.500> has<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.770> be<00:02:02.010> kind<00:02:02.220> of

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
powder but it all has to be kind of

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.650 
powder but it all has to be kind of
relative<00:02:02.670> so<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:02.940> can<00:02:03.060> add<00:02:03.150> a<00:02:03.180> little<00:02:03.450> more

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
relative so you can add a little more

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.480 
relative so you can add a little more
powder<00:02:03.870> but<00:02:04.560> probably<00:02:04.920> a<00:02:04.979> little<00:02:05.220> bit<00:02:05.460> more

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
powder but probably a little bit more

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.160 
powder but probably a little bit more
resin<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.090> make<00:02:06.150> sure<00:02:06.390> you<00:02:06.479> don't<00:02:06.660> get<00:02:06.780> clumps

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
resin to make sure you don't get clumps

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.050 
resin to make sure you don't get clumps
so<00:02:07.830> there<00:02:07.979> you<00:02:08.100> go<00:02:08.250> if<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:08.700> have<00:02:08.880> any
