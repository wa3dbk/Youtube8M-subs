00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.310 
on this side we have what's called a
dual<00:00:38.460> action<00:00:38.730> polisher<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.540> these<00:00:40.110> have

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
dual action polisher and these have

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.350 
dual action polisher and these have
become<00:00:40.379> very<00:00:40.980> popular<00:00:41.160> because<00:00:41.790> they're<00:00:42.120> so

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
become very popular because they're so

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.900 
become very popular because they're so
easy<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.750> use<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.379> you<00:00:43.950> can't<00:00:44.280> burn<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.700> paint

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
easy to use and you can't burn the paint

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.760 
easy to use and you can't burn the paint
and<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.270> can't<00:00:45.600> put<00:00:45.840> swirls<00:00:46.140> in<00:00:46.350> with<00:00:46.530> them

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
and you can't put swirls in with them

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.889 
and you can't put swirls in with them
yeah<00:00:47.070> then<00:00:47.280> with<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.460> foam<00:00:47.850> you're<00:00:48.600> not<00:00:48.719> going

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
yeah then with a foam you're not going

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.540 
yeah then with a foam you're not going
to<00:00:48.989> anywhere<00:00:49.379> near<00:00:49.559> as<00:00:49.739> hard<00:00:50.010> to<00:00:50.100> cut<00:00:50.309> Oh

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550

to anywhere near as hard to cut Oh
nowhere<00:00:51.120> near<00:00:51.329> as<00:00:51.480> much<00:00:51.629> damage<00:00:51.960> potential

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
nowhere near as much damage potential

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.170 
nowhere near as much damage potential
and<00:00:52.949> they've<00:00:53.100> become<00:00:53.250> very<00:00:53.430> popular<00:00:53.820> because

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
and they've become very popular because

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.119

modern<00:00:55.020> clear<00:00:55.320> coats<00:00:55.530> are<00:00:55.680> actually<00:00:55.920> pretty

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
modern clear coats are actually pretty

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.709 
modern clear coats are actually pretty
hard<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.699> so<00:00:56.850> when<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.300> me<00:00:57.390> go<00:00:57.480> out<00:00:57.539> of

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
hard and so when you and me go out of

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.630 
hard and so when you and me go out of
the<00:00:57.780> garage<00:00:57.989> when<00:00:58.770> we're<00:00:58.949> working<00:00:59.219> by<00:00:59.340> hand

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
the garage when we're working by hand

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.310 
the garage when we're working by hand
it's<00:00:59.940> hard<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.180> get<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.359> swirls<00:01:00.660> out<00:01:00.899> so

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
it's hard to get the swirls out so

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.900 
it's hard to get the swirls out so
that's<00:01:01.710> why<00:01:01.920> these<00:01:01.980> tools<00:01:02.309> have<00:01:02.430> become<00:01:02.489> so

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
that's why these tools have become so

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.350 
that's why these tools have become so
it's<00:01:03.210> way<00:01:03.359> hard<00:01:04.369> no<00:01:05.369> thanks<00:01:05.760> not<00:01:05.909> interested

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
it's way hard no thanks not interested

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.450 
it's way hard no thanks not interested
now<00:01:06.720> show<00:01:06.900> me<00:01:06.930> how<00:01:07.049> this<00:01:07.290> why<00:01:07.439> why<00:01:07.860> doesn't<00:01:08.189> it

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
now show me how this why why doesn't it

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.350 
now show me how this why why doesn't it
you<00:01:08.970> know

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
you know

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.300 
you know
okay<00:01:09.750> well<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.260> dual<00:01:10.409> action<00:01:10.590> polisher<00:01:11.130> has

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
okay well the dual action polisher has

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.370 
okay well the dual action polisher has
what's<00:01:11.520> called<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.820> free<00:01:12.090> rotating<00:01:12.600> spindle

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
what's called a free rotating spindle

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.440 
what's called a free rotating spindle
assembly<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:14.340> we<00:01:14.430> have<00:01:14.640> this<00:01:14.790> one<00:01:15.030> here<00:01:15.060> torn

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
assembly and we have this one here torn

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.999 
assembly and we have this one here torn
apart<00:01:15.570> so<00:01:15.810> you<00:01:15.960> can<00:01:16.080> take<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.290> look<00:01:16.590> at<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:16.920> as

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
apart so you can take a look at it as

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.609 
apart so you can take a look at it as
this<00:01:17.580> speeds<00:01:18.000> up<00:01:18.299> this<00:01:18.600> counterweight<00:01:19.110> helps

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
this speeds up this counterweight helps

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.920 
this speeds up this counterweight helps
the<00:01:19.740> pad<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.159> rotate<00:01:20.640> but<00:01:21.030> as<00:01:21.180> soon<00:01:21.450> as<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.689> put

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
the pad to rotate but as soon as you put

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.390 
the pad to rotate but as soon as you put
too<00:01:22.140> much<00:01:22.170> weight<00:01:22.560> on<00:01:22.590> this<00:01:22.920> what's<00:01:23.189> going<00:01:23.340> to

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
too much weight on this what's going to

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.890 
too much weight on this what's going to
happen<00:01:23.729> is<00:01:23.790> it'll<00:01:23.939> stop<00:01:24.270> now<00:01:24.479> I'll<00:01:24.630> show<00:01:24.810> you

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
happen is it'll stop now I'll show you

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.000 
happen is it'll stop now I'll show you
with<00:01:25.049> this<00:01:25.200> demonstrator

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.010 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.780 

like<00:01:28.430> this<00:01:28.670> to<00:01:28.880> hair<00:01:29.120> it<00:01:29.930> just<00:01:29.990> I<00:01:30.550> know<00:01:31.550> that's

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
like this to hair it just I know that's

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.490 
like this to hair it just I know that's
just<00:01:31.850> vibrates<00:01:32.540> against<00:01:32.900> the<00:01:32.960> paint<00:01:33.200> and<00:01:33.380> that

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
just vibrates against the paint and that

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.990 
just vibrates against the paint and that
keeps<00:01:33.800> you<00:01:33.920> from<00:01:33.950> burning<00:01:34.340> the<00:01:34.550> paint<00:01:34.790> or

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
keeps you from burning the paint or

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.850 
keeps you from burning the paint or
putting<00:01:35.360> swirls<00:01:35.660> in<00:01:35.900> now<00:01:36.230> what<00:01:36.410> is<00:01:36.500> this<00:01:36.650> I

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
putting swirls in now what is this I
