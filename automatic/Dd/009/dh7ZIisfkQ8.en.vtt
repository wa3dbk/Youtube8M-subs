00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.770
 hello friends, good evening, I have my 

00:00:02.739 --> 00:00:09.339
 hands to xperia ce all I just 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:15.980
 update the compilation number of 

00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:19.870
 this version is 23 0 1 to 3 12 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:23.160
 Update arrived 2 days ago 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:25.500
 and it came out in November 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.600
 I was hearing that only this 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.640
 version will arrive for models 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:36.120
 65 03 and only in certain countries 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:39.590
 I was checking that new changes have 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.720
 and the truth is that it is 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:46.070
 It is very similar to the previous version 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:49.910
 which is that it ends at 167 the number of 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:52.489
 compilation does not have many changes 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.920
 one of the things that I have noticed is in 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:58.070
 question of the camera that now the 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:01.100
 photographs come out with less light 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.040
 that the videos that with the number of 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.990
 previous compilation that ended in 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:09.460
 167 the photos came out with a little more 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.460
 light and the videos like 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:16.700
 another small detail is here in the 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:20.390
 sound audio settings sensitivity 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.310
 microphone allows us to adjust the 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.070
 microphone sensitivity at the time of 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.010
 record videos in high is to record 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:31.160
 videos in a room where maybe 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.340
 the sound is very low and in the middle is for 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.829
 record audio 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:39.219
 where we are in a place where there is no 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:42.429
 a lot of noise very loud or very low and in 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:44.350
 bass is to record sound let's say in a 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:47.200
 concert so that the sound listens to us 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:50.320
 saturated with this setting helps us a lot 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.979
 the normal thing is that we have it in car 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:58.420
 and as I was telling you, I did not find great 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:02:01.030
 details or big differences with the 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:06.540
 previous compilation number that was 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:11.720
 the 167 keeps running what is android 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:15.850
 4.4 nothing has changed in that 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:20.069
 and hopefully soon the 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:23.459
 the update of android 5 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:28.019
 As I tell you, there are not many changes that 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:30.269
 highlight everything is apparently the same as 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:34.220
 before the forgiveness that the compilation 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:36.980
 previous there is not much difference 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.920

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:54.590
 approximately one full day and the 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.740
 truth is that I do not find much 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.740
 difference 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.820
