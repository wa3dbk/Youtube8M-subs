00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:07.700
 Yes Hi this time continue the previous 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:10.970
 Well I jumped a bit once 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.019
 kindle of kindle white paper 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.130
 It is a small skill again 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.390
 I would like to introduce you 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.390
 If you say something 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.430
 I'd have this kindle white paper cover genuine brain 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:32.150
 This time I am not genuine 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:36.680
 I am using a third-party cover 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:39.690
 Whey guy is a bit like this and has no handle 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:42.470
 It is heavy or expensive 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.030
 I think there are some good points though 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:49.629
 I need a little bit 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:52.320
 I thought it would be okay to drink made in another company and bought another company 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:56.239
 If you buy it with other companies 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.239
 I'm not sure why 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:04.150
 I can not auto power off that one 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:08.250
 The kindle genuine kindle I'm the function is lucky 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:10.430
 Third-party to the guy is to say that does not have 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.430
 In a 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:17.650
 Say or can not be the actual situation and whether it is not possible to give the function of auto power off to an absolute 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:22.840
 That's not true 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:28.870
 It is power, and I will try it for a while if it can be done by this 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:32.430
 There is a third-party drink, but this standard does not have an auto power off function . 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:32.430
 I will turn on the power once 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:43.030
 I try to close it once with human beings attached 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.030
 At that time 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.650
 And moka 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.650
 I will open it 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:59.950
 Open is directly below luck again when is once again the power supply once the power is turned off as understanding face 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.950
 By all means this is actually the case 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:06.299
 this 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.299
 It is not a plate chocolate separately 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:15.739
 Magnet Magnet is a magnet 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.250
 There's a lot of trouble here , but I think that if you actually try it, you will understand 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.620
 but 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:23.340
 When the magnet approaches here 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.340
 Here and there 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:36.940
 And although a little there are tips closer soaked about walking rainbow N to around here it is here 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.940
 As you move closer or further away 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.659
 Cars kick 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.239
 From 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.810
 Here it is here 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.810
 When you talk 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.470
 I have to work in reverse 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.950
 It was not 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.950
 Move closer 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.140
 Talk 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.360
 Count 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:30.350
 Talk 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:30.350
 Then I will turn the power on and off. 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.730
 In it 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:40.360
 Oh dear 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:46.060
 It can actually be used if this magnet repulsion comes out 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:48.010
 Its function is actually also probably entered it contains the actual case also hereabouts strangely magnet 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:52.060
 I'd think that I'm Well attached I mean say 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:55.650
 And in fact, here it is also a fellow of genuine try stuck a pair tap magnet 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.650
 Well this to fit here 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:04.819
 If you give 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:07.730
 It is with after the function Well of sound after the husband can wear, but make 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:10.970
 I can not turn off the power right away 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:15.519
 Auto power off when time is set 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.519
 Or power Nde not be in such immediately be actual guy 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:20.639
 This ah ah ah unexpectedly it is quite useful 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.480
 I can not do it 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:32.290
 Sometimes there are times when it can not be said that the magnetic force is 4 times 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.290
 I can do it soon 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:41.830
 Put here to give I bought a type of magnet to wear with that Petatsu This is why I feel 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:44.970
 Auto power off function to mention 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.970
 Well afterward 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:52.170
 I can put it on like this 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:58.120
 It is convenient with damage and this can not be done other than genuine 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:05:00.680
 I'm pretty sold Kaiserslautern at Toka such a magnet home improvement doing well this 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:04.120
 If you buy something like this 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.120
 It may be useful unexpectedly 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:11.330
 In the kitchen I think I Did you mean I only I had thought that Na or bad only in genuine Yuzure 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:15.150
 There was 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:17.740
 Here Once you close the bar magnet magnet 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:21.250
 Auto power off guard 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:25.870
 Now that we know a little about that say can I tried to actually doing this 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:29.529
 If you do something like this, it wo n't stand out as much as you say 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:31.639
 If you stick like this and close it 

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:34.389
 When the remnant runs out 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:34.389
 I have not heard 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.930
 I've been there for a long time and I feel like getting married 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:48.770
 I am doing this but I think that can be seen and want to do the actual one more time 

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:48.770
 When Paka closes 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:06:00.810
 It is not technical when we put 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:06:05.460
 Properly Nde magnetic force is not so strong magnetic force to this but I'm all right with a somewhat strong 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:08.610
 Well with such a feeling not stuck around to have close contact with 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:13.750
 I 'm sorry if I do n't stick well enough to adhere 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:16.500
 Well, if that's the case I'm sure if I put it in another one 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:19.169
 One more piece of this 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:22.310
 If you stick too much 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:22.310
 I'm going to be busy 

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:27.509
 Such as 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:33.520
 I wonder if these things will come to an end 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.910
 Let's try it 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.910
 Your apology 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:47.169
 Never close 

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:47.169
 There is a part of that band 9 I'm a little floating I'm part of this magnet 

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:52.530
 Why not a little strong magnet 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:07:02.010
 It feels like it is a ramen building, but if there is a magnetic force there, it will soon be 

00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:02.010
 ThatLookLikeThis 

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:09.060
 Put in 

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:22.169
 Reco 

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:30.750
 We try to challenge once everyone was a little in you can on and off in such a feeling 

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:35.449
 And whether to have the case other than what about genuine 

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:40.150
 Here is a Rahen please trial fried 

00:07:35.449 --> 00:07:40.150
 But this time I'm sorry for this. Goodbye
