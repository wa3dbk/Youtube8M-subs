let me go ahead and show you where this

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.770 
let me go ahead and show you where this
part<00:00:58.949> is<00:00:59.070> located<00:00:59.640> if<00:00:59.789> you<00:01:00.270> look<00:01:00.420> to<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.750> right

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
part is located if you look to the right

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.660 
part is located if you look to the right
of<00:01:01.199> your<00:01:01.440> radiator<00:01:01.770> you're<00:01:02.250> going<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.430> see<00:01:02.550> the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
of your radiator you're going to see the

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.990 
of your radiator you're going to see the
air<00:01:02.820> filter<00:01:03.239> if<00:01:03.890> you<00:01:04.890> just<00:01:05.129> kind<00:01:05.430> of<00:01:05.519> duck<00:01:05.729> down

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
air filter if you just kind of duck down

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000 
air filter if you just kind of duck down
underneath<00:01:06.390> and<00:01:06.689> look<00:01:06.869> right<00:01:07.080> down<00:01:07.530> below

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
underneath and look right down below

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.950 
underneath and look right down below
you're<00:01:08.880> going<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.090> see<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.299> little<00:01:09.540> cylinder

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
you're going to see a little cylinder

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.800 
you're going to see a little cylinder
and<00:01:10.290> that's<00:01:10.860> your<00:01:11.100> purge<00:01:11.310> valve<00:01:11.750> now<00:01:12.750> the

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
and that's your purge valve now the

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.800 
and that's your purge valve now the
question<00:01:13.170> is<00:01:13.350> how<00:01:13.590> do<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:13.740> get<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.600> well<00:01:15.600> if

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
question is how do you get to it well if

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.929 
question is how do you get to it well if
your<00:01:15.930> automotive<00:01:16.470> lis<00:01:16.740> inclined<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.790> can

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
your automotive lis inclined you can

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.280 
your automotive lis inclined you can
remove<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.360> air<00:01:18.479> filter<00:01:18.810> and<00:01:18.900> get<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.170> it

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
remove the air filter and get to it

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.870 
remove the air filter and get to it
easily<00:01:19.530> but<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:19.979> be<00:01:20.040> quite<00:01:20.159> honest<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.670> didn't

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
easily but to be quite honest I didn't

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.359 
easily but to be quite honest I didn't
know<00:01:20.909> how<00:01:21.170> but<00:01:22.170> just<00:01:22.350> above<00:01:22.560> that<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:22.979> the

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
know how but just above that is the

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.730 
know how but just above that is the
battery<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.509> if<00:01:24.960> you<00:01:25.049> remove<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.439> battery

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
battery and if you remove the battery

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.160 
battery and if you remove the battery
you<00:01:25.890> have<00:01:25.920> just<00:01:26.340> enough<00:01:26.549> room<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:27.180> reach<00:01:27.960> the

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
you have just enough room to reach the

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.499 
you have just enough room to reach the
connections<00:01:28.680> for<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.040> purge<00:01:29.250> valve<00:01:29.509> so

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
connections for the purge valve so

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.510 
connections for the purge valve so
here's<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.900> purge<00:01:31.110> valve<00:01:31.380> up<00:01:31.590> close<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.369> as

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
here's the purge valve up close and as

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.859 
here's the purge valve up close and as
you<00:01:32.640> can<00:01:32.729> see<00:01:32.790> it's<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.119> really<00:01:33.329> simple<00:01:33.750> design

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
you can see it's a really simple design

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.899 
you can see it's a really simple design
there's<00:01:34.320> only<00:01:34.470> three<00:01:34.740> parts<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.220> it<00:01:35.369> there's

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
there's only three parts to it there's

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.420

because if they're old like mine they

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.210 
because if they're old like mine they
may<00:01:51.390> crack<00:01:51.720> and<00:01:51.930> break<00:01:52.020> on<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.470> as<00:01:52.649> you<00:01:53.159> can

steps that I took first I located the

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.469 
steps that I took first I located the
evaporation<00:01:59.250> purge<00:01:59.640> valve<00:01:59.939> below<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.329> air

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
remove the air filter you'll have much

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.080 
remove the air filter you'll have much
easier<00:02:10.170> access<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.890> be<00:02:11.340> honest<00:02:11.610> I<00:02:11.730> just<00:02:11.910> didn't

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
my third step was to remove the old

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.309 
my third step was to remove the old
hoses<00:02:16.150> and<00:02:16.270> electrical<00:02:16.720> connections<00:02:16.989> from

them on the new one and finally

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:24.089 
them on the new one and finally
reinstall<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.870> battery<00:02:23.020> I'd<00:02:23.620> like<00:02:23.800> to<00:02:23.920> leave
