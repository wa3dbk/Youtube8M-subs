00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.329
 hello how about how are the directivity of 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:10.139
 the microphones is one of his 

00:00:06.329 --> 00:00:12.990
 characteristics and tells us which side 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.299
 of the microphone are taking the pressure 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.869
 sound on which side they are amplifying the 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.429
 sound here we have some microphones 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.779
 unicar today of a microphone 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:23.730
 condenser 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.830
 and each of them has a 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.470
 characteristic of a particular use 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.390
 Of course there are other features 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.730
 super important also on a beach 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.010
 in a microphone that are the sensitivity 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.600
 the fidelity that are parameters that 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.310
 it also tells us the manufacturer that they are going 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.680
 related to the use that maintaining 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.840
 according to his directivity that is to say of 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.020
 where are they taking the sound 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.460
 we have mainly the 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:51.840
 unidirectional ones that are the ones that have 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:54.550
 a single direction of sound extraction 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.370
 this for example is a microphone 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:00.460
 dynamic and you could say that it is 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:03.220
 unidirectional and where it's marked in 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.950
 general by this horizontal line that 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.170
 we have and the best partner with age is like this 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.229
 because we are giving only one address 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.810
 of intake for the diaphragm that has the 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.750
 sensitivity to translate from the 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:19.690
 microphone is to say that everything that is the 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:23.830
 catchment is going to be reduced to how 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:27.040
 go influencing to even be almost 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.350
 negative that is the back what 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.759
 which in a certain way is an advantage 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.009
 for when we are having problems 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:35.229
 of feedback and we do not want certain 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:38.649
 noises are feeding us the 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:42.170
 signal is to say that the unidirectional 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:46.030
 they have a particular use is one of their 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:49.189
 directivity is after we have the 1000 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:52.270
 directional that for your name indicates 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:55.430
 two zones are not being taken 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.860
 sound pressure catchment 20 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.080
 sectionals are sometimes used when 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.580
 we have no part where we are going to have 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.479
 problems with feedback and 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:09.069
 feedback and of course we're going to 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:11.239
 able to handle in both directions the 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:14.290
 directive you will not find sometimes 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:16.819
 in the manuals of the microphones that 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:20.000
 represent with the polar diagram that is 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.260
 a diagram is roughly on cross 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.350
 they are giving 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.209
 all that is the spectrum and the 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.040
 microphone is giving you for example the 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:31.580
 unidirectional that you will find that 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:34.010
 they have a catch on the front the 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.160
 bidirectional in a catchment by the 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.670
 front and the back in 180 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:44.090
 degrees 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:46.560
 and then you will have the UFOs 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.860
 directional that are those 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:54.020
 microphones that take the whole spectrum and 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.020
 all 360 degrees 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:00.060
 the 360 ​​degrees of what the spectrum is 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.040
 where are they placed 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.200
 of course for other uses while 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.470
 We can reach the bidirectional 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.610
 have for example in a radio where 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.739
 interviewer and interviewee are 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.420
 confronted , we can have it there and 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.670
 there are induced tables that can 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.040
 be part of the set or if not in 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.260
 choirs also where we have different 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.080
 singers and celebrities with a microphone to 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.849
 the taking of the voices in general and 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.310
 then the directional zombies by 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:29.580
 supposedly with other uses they are also going to 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.769
 encompass a larger spectrum and then 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.950
 we have according to the extinct 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:37.080
 directivity a very characteristic 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:41.370
 important in some microphones that is 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:45.629
 this is called a pattern 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:47.549
 to take directv factor that after 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:53.129
 we have the microphones that according to 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:55.680
 their activity are multipathetic ie 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:58.140
 that we can select if the 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:02.250
 we will use as unidirectional 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:04.079
 or omnidirectional or we have here one 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.360
 as to have sample this is a 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:08.280
 condenser microphone and we have a 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.079
 selector where we can choose if what 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.269
 let's use unidirectional 

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:15.780
 bidirectional or even also in 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:18.150
 omnidirectional way here we have a 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.820
 divider where the 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.289
 front and back the microphone and this 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.229
 microphone is no longer used 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:26.820
 in this way how the dynamic was used 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:30.539
 from the previous example but this one 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:33.120
 Use upright as well or by 

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:34.620
 supposed work because it would be the same and 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.330
 we have a selector 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.130
 located in the back where we 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.860
 indicates the pattern of directing since 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:43.470
 we want to give you we can use it 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:46.910
 only for the front shot 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:50.570
 also for both front and back 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:52.670
 inclusive to do the 360 ​​degrees and 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.980
 use it omnidirectional mind say 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:57.800
 that I can capture all the sounds in 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.930
 general are microphones of a certain 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.060
 sensitivity used in the study and that 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.640
 can in the case of a single vocalist 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:07.370
 put it in unidirectional way to 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.110
 this front or also in my case 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.150
 omnidirectional or bidirectional if 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:14.050
 we have to take a chorus and we have 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:17.830
 several people who are going to give us 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:20.770
 the sound that we need to capture so 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.900
 of course agree to use you 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.539
 let's go to the microphone is always 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.909
 good to meet him of course 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:30.190
 to what is sensitivity and 

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:32.909
 fidelity that are also parameters is 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:36.099
 super important for what is the 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:39.220
 microphone and of course good too 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:41.289
 there is a cost issue in everything that is 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:43.030
 the construction of a microphone the 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:45.699
 which of course unfortunately 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.770
 the price is always associated with what 

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:50.979
 are the quality of benefits and 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:54.250
 we can have it as a guide where 

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:56.199
 let's know that the most expensive ones are going to do 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.550
 as sometimes those who will give us better 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:59.379
 results 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:02.340
 directivity then in the microphones 

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:02.340
 see you next
