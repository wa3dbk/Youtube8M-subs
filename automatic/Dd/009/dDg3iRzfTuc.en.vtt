what flappy paddles on a one liter
engine<00:02:10.830> I<00:02:11.009> like<00:02:11.520> it<00:02:11.730> it's<00:02:12.060> kind<00:02:12.239> of<00:02:12.300> sporting

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720

engine I like it it's kind of sporting
yeah<00:02:12.930> that<00:02:13.080> makes<00:02:13.260> it<00:02:13.440> cool<00:02:13.650> with<00:02:14.519> a<00:02:14.550> very

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
yeah that makes it cool with a very

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.300 
yeah that makes it cool with a very
short<00:02:15.330> wheelbase<00:02:15.599> this<00:02:16.440> throws<00:02:16.800> up<00:02:16.980> some<00:02:17.130> wide

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
short wheelbase this throws up some wide

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.610 
short wheelbase this throws up some wide
negatives<00:02:17.790> if<00:02:18.390> you<00:02:18.660> hit<00:02:18.780> a<00:02:18.810> bump<00:02:18.989> you'll<00:02:19.470> be

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
negatives if you hit a bump you'll be

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.620 
negatives if you hit a bump you'll be
thrown<00:02:19.830> up<00:02:19.950> in<00:02:20.069> the<00:02:20.099> air<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:20.519> the<00:02:21.239> whole<00:02:21.420> coals

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
thrown up in the air and the whole coals

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:22.759 
thrown up in the air and the whole coals
sink<00:02:22.019> into<00:02:22.170> a<00:02:22.290> pothole

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
sink into a pothole

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.280 
sink into a pothole
so<00:02:23.280> dodging<00:02:23.610> need<00:02:23.760> is<00:02:23.940> vitally<00:02:24.450> important<00:02:24.900> if

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
so dodging need is vitally important if

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.500 
so dodging need is vitally important if
you<00:02:25.440> want<00:02:25.560> to<00:02:25.620> keep<00:02:25.709> your<00:02:25.860> spine<00:02:26.220> intact<00:02:26.670> but

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
you want to keep your spine intact but

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.089 
you want to keep your spine intact but
the<00:02:27.750> steering<00:02:28.140> is<00:02:28.230> weighted<00:02:28.560> nice<00:02:28.769> and<00:02:28.980> heavy

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
the steering is weighted nice and heavy

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:31.309 
the steering is weighted nice and heavy
so<00:02:29.760> that's<00:02:30.030> at<00:02:30.180> higher<00:02:30.360> speed<00:02:30.630> you<00:02:31.110> feel

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
so that's at higher speed you feel

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.009 
so that's at higher speed you feel
totally<00:02:31.680> in<00:02:32.010> control<00:02:32.299> and<00:02:33.299> with<00:02:33.450> speed<00:02:33.690> brings

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
totally in control and with speed brings

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.960 
totally in control and with speed brings
me<00:02:34.170> to<00:02:34.350> safety<00:02:34.560> if<00:02:35.250> you<00:02:35.310> look<00:02:35.519> at<00:02:35.610> the<00:02:35.670> smart
