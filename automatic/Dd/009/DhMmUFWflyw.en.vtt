00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
like to see it so with my last video I

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.470 
like to see it so with my last video I
had<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.210> lot<00:00:18.330> of<00:00:18.390> interest<00:00:18.779> in<00:00:19.020> these<00:00:20.480> motion

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
had a lot of interest in these motion

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.750 
had a lot of interest in these motion
control<00:00:21.840> like<00:00:22.170> slow-moving<00:00:22.800> time-lapse

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
control like slow-moving time-lapse

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.300 
control like slow-moving time-lapse
shots<00:00:23.970> that<00:00:24.240> I<00:00:24.269> did<00:00:24.480> which<00:00:24.689> was<00:00:24.720> based<00:00:24.990> on<00:00:25.310> the

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
shots that I did which was based on the

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.210 
shots that I did which was based on the
mead<00:00:26.910> DS<00:00:27.180> telescope<00:00:27.930> mount<00:00:28.199> motorized<00:00:28.949> arm

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
mead DS telescope mount motorized arm

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.820 
mead DS telescope mount motorized arm
and<00:00:29.490> so<00:00:30.390> for<00:00:30.599> this<00:00:30.689> video<00:00:31.019> I<00:00:31.080> decided<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.650> do

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
and so for this video I decided to do

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.889 
and so for this video I decided to do
some<00:00:32.700> more<00:00:32.730> of<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:32.969> but<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.270> also<00:00:33.360> wanted<00:00:33.840> to

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
some more of that but I also wanted to

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.180 
some more of that but I also wanted to
kind<00:00:34.140> of<00:00:34.200> one<00:00:34.350> up<00:00:34.469> those<00:00:34.680> with<00:00:34.860> a<00:00:34.890> different

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
kind of one up those with a different

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.440 
kind of one up those with a different
sort<00:00:35.340> of<00:00:35.399> shots<00:00:35.640> so<00:00:35.790> I<00:00:35.820> developed<00:00:36.210> this<00:00:36.270> other

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
sort of shots so I developed this other

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.330 
sort of shots so I developed this other
camera<00:00:36.780> system<00:00:37.110> which<00:00:37.890> I'm<00:00:37.980> going<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.160> show<00:00:38.280> to

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
camera system which I'm going to show to

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:44.299 
camera system which I'm going to show to
you<00:00:38.460> now<00:00:39.230> and<00:00:40.340> here<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.399> is<00:00:42.710> kind<00:00:43.710> of<00:00:43.829> like<00:00:44.010> the

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
you now and here it is kind of like the

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.029 
you now and here it is kind of like the
dolly<00:00:44.969> shots<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:45.539> had<00:00:45.780> where<00:00:46.739> I<00:00:46.800> had<00:00:46.920> this

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
dolly shots I had where I had this

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.950 
dolly shots I had where I had this
telescope<00:00:47.640> arm<00:00:47.879> this<00:00:48.120> meat<00:00:48.329> telescope<00:00:48.780> arm

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
telescope arm this meat telescope arm

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.340 
telescope arm this meat telescope arm
pulling<00:00:49.280> the<00:00:50.280> dolly<00:00:50.520> on<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.390> track<00:00:51.960> on<00:00:52.199> the

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
pulling the dolly on a track on the

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.049 
pulling the dolly on a track on the
ground<00:00:52.620> I've<00:00:52.920> kind<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.250> adapted<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.820> with<00:00:53.940> this

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
ground I've kind of adapted it with this

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.560 
ground I've kind of adapted it with this
monorail<00:00:54.539> system<00:00:55.129> here<00:00:56.129> where<00:00:56.940> you<00:00:57.360> can<00:00:57.510> see

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
monorail system here where you can see

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.200 
monorail system here where you can see
around<00:00:58.020> here<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.910> have<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.030> suspended<00:01:00.600> on<00:01:02.210> this

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
around here I have it suspended on this

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.010 
around here I have it suspended on this
one<00:01:03.570> rail<00:01:03.840> I<00:01:04.339> have<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.549> drive<00:01:06.240> wheels<00:01:06.570> here

attached to that is of course the camera
which<00:01:40.079> in<00:01:40.229> this<00:01:40.290> case<00:01:40.350> is<00:01:40.590> mounted<00:01:41.040> upside

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
which in this case is mounted upside

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.730 
which in this case is mounted upside
down<00:01:41.640> but<00:01:41.970> in<00:01:42.720> post-production<00:01:43.170> we<00:01:43.590> can

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
down but in post-production we can

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.260 
down but in post-production we can
easily<00:01:43.890> flip<00:01:44.399> that<00:01:44.610> upside<00:01:45.119> down<00:01:47.090> and<00:01:48.090> of

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
easily flip that upside down and of

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.300 
easily flip that upside down and of
course<00:01:48.299> here<00:01:48.720> we<00:01:48.810> have<00:01:48.930> dangling<00:01:49.409> the

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
course here we have dangling the

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.940 
course here we have dangling the
controls<00:01:50.820> I'll<00:01:51.299> just<00:01:51.689> show<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.140> arm<00:01:52.259> the

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
controls I'll just show you the arm the

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.899 
controls I'll just show you the arm the
the<00:01:53.490> track<00:01:53.790> right<00:01:54.030> here<00:01:55.340> goes<00:01:56.340> all<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.670> way

across i used a tubing roller to roll
one<00:02:01.530> of<00:02:01.649> these<00:02:01.770> pieces<00:02:02.159> of<00:02:02.460> again<00:02:02.700> emt<00:02:03.270> the

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
one of these pieces of again emt the

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.150 
one of these pieces of again emt the
same<00:02:03.770> rails<00:02:04.770> that<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.250> have<00:02:05.549> set<00:02:06.149> on<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.630> ground

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
same rails that I have set on the ground

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.279 
same rails that I have set on the ground
for<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.250> dolly<00:02:08.690> that<00:02:09.690> just<00:02:09.869> go<00:02:09.989> all<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.259> way

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
for the dolly that just go all the way

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.620 
for the dolly that just go all the way
out<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:11.700> end

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
out to the end

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.170 
out to the end
here<00:02:13.070> you<00:02:14.070> can<00:02:14.190> see<00:02:14.400> I<00:02:14.430> found<00:02:14.670> another<00:02:14.970> piece

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
here you can see I found another piece

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.820 
here you can see I found another piece
of<00:02:15.390> metal<00:02:15.540> tubing<00:02:15.960> which<00:02:16.110> fits<00:02:16.350> right<00:02:16.590> inside

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
of metal tubing which fits right inside

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.540 
of metal tubing which fits right inside
really<00:02:17.400> snug<00:02:17.670> there<00:02:18.290> this<00:02:19.290> this<00:02:19.980> is<00:02:20.040> a<00:02:20.160> stand

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
really snug there this this is a stand

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.550 
really snug there this this is a stand
for<00:02:20.700> a<00:02:20.940> a<00:02:22.670> photography<00:02:23.670> background<00:02:24.090> set<00:02:24.360> up

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
for a a photography background set up

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.380 
for a a photography background set up
that<00:02:25.560> I<00:02:25.590> have<00:02:25.860> that<00:02:26.250> I'm<00:02:26.430> just<00:02:26.880> using<00:02:27.030> for<00:02:27.330> this

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
that I have that I'm just using for this

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.980 
that I have that I'm just using for this
case<00:02:27.660> a<00:02:27.960> hole<00:02:28.770> was<00:02:29.010> drilled<00:02:29.220> right<00:02:29.460> here<00:02:29.990> into

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
case a hole was drilled right here into

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.560 
case a hole was drilled right here into
the<00:02:31.110> tubing<00:02:31.580> which<00:02:32.580> then<00:02:32.790> goes<00:02:32.970> through<00:02:33.030> and

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
the tubing which then goes through and

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.270 
the tubing which then goes through and
there<00:02:34.110> are<00:02:34.230> a<00:02:34.260> couple<00:02:34.470> this<00:02:34.770> is<00:02:34.920> actually

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
there are a couple this is actually

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.210 
there are a couple this is actually
three<00:02:35.520> pieces<00:02:36.020> to<00:02:37.020> 10<00:02:37.290> foot<00:02:37.530> pieces<00:02:37.740> and

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
three pieces to 10 foot pieces and

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.500 
three pieces to 10 foot pieces and
they're<00:02:38.400> joined<00:02:38.730> in<00:02:38.910> here<00:02:39.090> again<00:02:39.180> with

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
they're joined in here again with

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.640 
they're joined in here again with
another<00:02:39.740> piece<00:02:40.740> of<00:02:40.950> tubing<00:02:42.290> that<00:02:43.290> smaller

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
another piece of tubing that smaller

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.170 
another piece of tubing that smaller
tubing<00:02:44.160> fit<00:02:44.400> in<00:02:44.520> between<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:44.940> hold<00:02:45.090> it

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
tubing fit in between to hold it

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.650 
tubing fit in between to hold it
together<00:02:45.300> but<00:02:45.900> this<00:02:46.320> is<00:02:46.470> three<00:02:46.890> pieces<00:02:47.640> of<00:02:47.820> of

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
together but this is three pieces of of

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.730 
together but this is three pieces of of
the<00:02:48.870> EMT<00:02:49.320> tubing<00:02:49.860> to<00:02:50.460> 10<00:02:50.700> foot<00:02:50.970> pieces<00:02:51.180> and<00:02:51.630> I

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
the EMT tubing to 10 foot pieces and I

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.900 
the EMT tubing to 10 foot pieces and I
think<00:02:52.740> this<00:02:52.800> is<00:02:52.860> a<00:02:52.950> four<00:02:53.250> foot<00:02:53.430> piece<00:02:53.640> here<00:02:53.850> at

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
think this is a four foot piece here at

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.960 
think this is a four foot piece here at
the<00:02:54.000> very<00:02:54.180> end<00:02:54.360> to<00:02:54.480> complete<00:02:54.780> it<00:02:54.900> and<00:02:55.970> here's

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
the very end to complete it and here's

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.790 
the very end to complete it and here's
another<00:02:57.090> stand<00:02:57.570> here<00:02:57.960> I<00:02:58.110> should<00:02:58.680> probably

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
another stand here I should probably

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.620 
another stand here I should probably
have<00:02:59.160> a<00:02:59.190> couple<00:02:59.520> more<00:02:59.700> stands<00:03:00.150> for<00:03:00.510> this

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
have a couple more stands for this

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.720 
have a couple more stands for this
length<00:03:00.870> but<00:03:01.260> I<00:03:01.500> think<00:03:02.130> it'll<00:03:02.310> be<00:03:02.340> alright<00:03:04.730> this

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
length but I think it'll be alright this

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.390 
length but I think it'll be alright this
isn't<00:03:06.000> just<00:03:06.120> a<00:03:06.240> tripod<00:03:06.690> stand<00:03:07.010> which<00:03:08.010> I'm<00:03:08.190> very

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
isn't just a tripod stand which I'm very

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.090 
isn't just a tripod stand which I'm very
crudely<00:03:08.880> adapted<00:03:09.600> this<00:03:10.260> piece<00:03:10.500> of<00:03:10.650> angle<00:03:10.830> iron

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
crudely adapted this piece of angle iron

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.520 
crudely adapted this piece of angle iron
which<00:03:11.460> was<00:03:11.640> bent<00:03:11.940> there's<00:03:12.690> a<00:03:12.780> tiny<00:03:13.080> hole<00:03:13.350> just

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
which was bent there's a tiny hole just

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.410 
which was bent there's a tiny hole just
to<00:03:13.710> kind<00:03:13.920> of<00:03:13.980> keep<00:03:14.130> it<00:03:15.980> stable<00:03:16.980> there<00:03:17.390> with<00:03:18.390> a

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
to kind of keep it stable there with a

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:19.790 
to kind of keep it stable there with a
little<00:03:18.690> bit<00:03:18.810> of<00:03:18.870> a<00:03:18.990> counterweight<00:03:19.410> at<00:03:19.710> the

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
little bit of a counterweight at the

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.820 
little bit of a counterweight at the
other<00:03:19.950> end<00:03:21.320> just<00:03:22.320> to<00:03:22.410> kind<00:03:22.620> of<00:03:22.680> keep

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
other end just to kind of keep

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.670 
other end just to kind of keep
everything<00:03:23.130> balanced<00:03:24.200> if<00:03:25.200> I<00:03:25.320> go<00:03:25.440> ahead<00:03:25.530> and

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
everything balanced if I go ahead and

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:36.410 
everything balanced if I go ahead and
turn<00:03:25.950> this<00:03:26.130> one<00:03:26.280> on<00:03:34.250> you<00:03:35.250> can<00:03:35.400> see<00:03:35.640> now<00:03:35.820> this

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
turn this one on you can see now this

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.880 
turn this one on you can see now this
one<00:03:36.600> actually<00:03:36.780> it<00:03:37.080> can<00:03:37.230> go<00:03:37.350> two<00:03:37.410> ways<00:03:37.560> I

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
one actually it can go two ways I

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:50.570 
one actually it can go two ways I
haven't<00:03:38.160> used<00:03:38.250> the<00:03:38.370> second<00:03:38.760> way<00:03:38.820> yet<00:03:39.500> but

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:56.510 

of<00:03:51.420> course<00:03:51.660> this<00:03:51.840> main<00:03:52.080> way<00:03:52.290> where<00:03:52.500> this<00:03:55.520> or

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
of course this main way where this or

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:08.660 
of course this main way where this or
this<00:03:56.670> wheel<00:03:56.910> spins<00:03:57.300> here

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.530 

again<00:04:09.630> just<00:04:09.840> very<00:04:10.110> very<00:04:10.500> slowly<00:04:11.510> down<00:04:12.510> the

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
again just very very slowly down the

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.390 
again just very very slowly down the
entire<00:04:13.020> length<00:04:13.260> of<00:04:13.500> the<00:04:13.620> track<00:04:13.890> to<00:04:14.069> get<00:04:14.220> that

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
entire length of the track to get that

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.770 
entire length of the track to get that
shot

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.110 

so<00:04:20.560> yeah<00:04:21.070> it's<00:04:21.220> not<00:04:21.340> a<00:04:21.370> perfect<00:04:21.579> system<00:04:21.850> you

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
so yeah it's not a perfect system you

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.030 
so yeah it's not a perfect system you
could<00:04:22.210> say<00:04:22.389> see<00:04:22.930> it<00:04:23.020> sways<00:04:23.440> a<00:04:23.470> little<00:04:23.920> bit

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
could say see it sways a little bit

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.180 
could say see it sways a little bit
unlike<00:04:24.370> the<00:04:24.550> normal<00:04:25.710> tracking<00:04:26.710> shots<00:04:26.950> that<00:04:27.160> I

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
unlike the normal tracking shots that I

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.000 
unlike the normal tracking shots that I
do<00:04:27.310> on<00:04:27.400> the<00:04:27.550> ground<00:04:27.850> but<00:04:28.830> considering<00:04:29.830> it<00:04:29.919> was

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
do on the ground but considering it was

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.590 
do on the ground but considering it was
put<00:04:30.160> together<00:04:30.280> in<00:04:30.460> about<00:04:30.730> two<00:04:31.389> and<00:04:31.419> a<00:04:31.570> half

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
put together in about two and a half

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.350 
put together in about two and a half
hours<00:04:32.080> including<00:04:32.260> that<00:04:33.220> whole<00:04:33.430> mount

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
hours including that whole mount

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.320 
hours including that whole mount
assembly<00:04:34.660> there<00:04:35.280> I<00:04:36.280> think<00:04:37.030> it<00:04:37.090> turned<00:04:37.240> out

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
assembly there I think it turned out

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.960 
assembly there I think it turned out
pretty<00:04:37.450> good<00:04:37.660> yep<00:04:38.410> so<00:04:39.250> that's<00:04:39.460> it<00:04:39.639> the

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
pretty good yep so that's it the
