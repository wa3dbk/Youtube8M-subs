00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:19.410
 for this year simon here on Monday morning under 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.060
 afternoon we turn back out of the gym 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.640
 that means there will be a nice one again 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.990
 Exercise today was really an exercise 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.060
 in my opinion very strong 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.619
 neglected I rarely see them 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.619
 in james i find them very much 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.120
 good and as the annika it 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.230
 practically the biceps curls on 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.390
 all the time has done so 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.010
 they are often arnold kÃ¶lns or annie 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.559
 Cars are actually called 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.190
 concentration spurs where you 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.379
 practically no stock on the back 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.600
 elbows I have to do it now 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.379
 maybe first of all why do I think 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.440
 the very good 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.920
 you can with the girls with the articles 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.780
 very good the shape of her biceps 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.329
 that means we can improve a lot 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.579
 very nice to train the biceps height 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.870
 as really what anni really 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.360
 it was big when you really did 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.880
 pictures to look he has quite a 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.680
 gigantic point in the biceps and now 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.450
 many of you will say simon has 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.729
 Do not be nonsense you can biceps 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.830
 or you can not shape the biceps 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.729
 change this is genetically predetermined 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.860
 not quite right 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.530
 you can influence 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.619
 the biceps form because we are two 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.750
 biceps heads we still have 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.880
 the brute about the hammer curls 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.860
 train very well and we can 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.360
 him different degrees on the biceps 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.920
 minds you know hammer curls 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.869
 have the brute in it 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.630
 you know the whole part here 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.600
 normal bicep curls we have a lot 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.979
 strong the short biceps head with it 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.170
 he works very hard when we do the 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.360
 Poor info fixed when we got behind 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.030
 on the elbows are turn if we are 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.850
 That's why the arm is so for example 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.350
 often weird bench exercise just fine if we 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.399
 the poor bit further away from the body 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.810
 that is, if we have a bit 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.259
 have served and here we have the 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.360
 very strongly stretched the outer head the 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.640
 outer biceps head just the point 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.229
 The tip is really made here 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.479
 so the outer for that is the outer one 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.319
 biceps head responsible if we have the 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.420
 especially with pure take 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:15.849
 then we can actually influence 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.680
 take on our biceps height on the 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:21.489
 biceps tip long speech 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.889
 take a weight does not increase 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.629
 that means a lot of weight 

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:27.939
 with six to eight repetitions in July 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:31.209
 clean clean means that he is the 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:32.739
 really right up to pull up 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.719
 can and then down again 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.519
 you can kneel where you can 

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:38.650
 you can support yourself somewhere 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:41.499
 no main thing is really here 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:47.859
 brace yourself somewhere fix her 

00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:57.310
 upper arm and turns up here bit 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:59.049
 It's very important to get out of here 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.090
 Turn the exercise on this lightweight line 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:04.989
 that is, the exercise is so good 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.849
 because we at the highest weight in the 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.230
 biggest lever we have the full 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:10.209
 contraction into the part 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.500
 second point is where the very 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.790
 still does not stretch nicely 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.060
 stay energized all the time 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.889
 and you can really do that very much 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.959
 pretty handy so I wish you that 

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:21.639
 Last exercise for the biceps times 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.810
 suggest if you like my biceps 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:24.159
 train through it if you are 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.169
 especially the height 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:28.239
 wanted to work makes the exercise 

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:29.049
 isolated unbelievable so there helps 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.199
 really nothing with 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:35.650
 You have to be beautiful by the weight 

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:37.959
 suddenly stopped by the whole by 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:42.250
 you just have the attitude of movement 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:45.280
 a very different charm than with 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.720
 Exercise Tips Exercise Construction Two 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.909
 new bicep workout with a 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.709
 just subscribe to the channel 

00:03:48.909 --> 00:03:52.689
 training plan there is the exercise in it 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.489
 that's why I make it again 

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:55.930
 and then you look closely and 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:59.849
 Let her in if you really want the 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.849
 want to have relationship with it until then
