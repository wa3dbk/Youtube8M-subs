00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 all beaver dear friends today we have 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.240
 similar to the fnaf movie news day because 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.160
 that I have a prize to cook a couple more 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.080
 iron horse fotochek 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.210
 the creators of this film and these 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.880
 pictures are really very interesting 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.250
 because they are similar and a reference to fnaf 3 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.970
 well let's go become see 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.109
 The first photo here is a report about 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.240
 fire which occurred 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.060
 presumably nothing in the pizza place 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.340
 recalls in fnaf 3 there was a fire in the very 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.070
 end in this particular fire could burn 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.950
 springtrap but not burned but there is one more 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.739
 option in 3 parts fnaf there are phantoms and 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.840
 and phantoms for some reason are charred 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.760
 such an option that the authors of this film 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.829
 decided to try to answer one of 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.879
 these questions or what happens 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.649
 after fnaf 3 or why phantoms 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.960
 burned and here's another photo with 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.770
 foxy but I know what's interesting to see the 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.500
 the fire 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.899
 it looks like foxy in this picture 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.059
 trying to escape from the fire and judging because 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.210
 that fire is already around foxy 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.700
 he will not have time to escape and will burn there so 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.640
 apparently a new guard tried 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.210
 burn the pizzeria and apparently it is him 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.220
 succeeded 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.439
 considering the news I talked about in 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.409
 the beginning but they managed the woman of all 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.630
 animatronicov and springtrap managed to leave 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.430
 restaurant and now let's tell the plot 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.439
 which gave hints of the authors themselves 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.900
 film I think the plot will be 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.119
 happen already closer to fnaf 3 when in 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.810
 springtrape I already sat purple 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:33.180
 the guy and the children were already killed exactly 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.070
 so the police came to the restaurant 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.900
 which we saw in the screenshot which 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.420
 just investigated the missing case 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.979
 children in this restaurant and right here 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.140
 I suppose the filmmakers decided 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.689
 explain why fnaf 3 main character 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.210
 sees burnt animatronics can 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:51.030
 be that the filmmakers tie the events 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.950
 in the film to the events in the game again 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.259
 happens in stock only at this 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.509
 stock now stored out animatronics 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.790
 who left fnaf 2 as it was 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.560
 written in the newspaper there it was written that 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.960
 old animatronics are sent to 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.369
 warehouse until better times and plus i still have you 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.200
 when told that these 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.330
 animatronics are not the same animatronics 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.520
 what is in fnaf 1 also in this warehouse 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.390
 turned out to be springtrap I also long ago 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.280
 argued to 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.350
 cries to everyone's opinion springtrap not 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.360
 was in a secret room along with 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.610
 automata because automata in fnaf 3 already 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.920
 stood at the beginning of the game and here is the springtrap 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.670
 was not yet mean the sprint was found 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.160
 somewhere 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.990
 down the secret room for example on this 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.390
 in the warehouse where there were aldy 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:33.150
 and precisely these Altai animatronics we 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.800
 see phantoms in fnaf 3 and guard 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.050
 who worked in this place burned 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.690
 animatronics and saw them burned 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.540
 after that will go to work in some 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.420
 phaseber fride is the very place that we 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.820
 we see in fnaf 3 and he will come there then 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.420
 to finish the job and finish 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:51.600
 animatronics who left last time 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.820
 springtrap 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.830
 and burnt animatronics he sits there 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.040
 like hallucinations due to broken 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:01.290
 ventilation which causes him 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:04.739
 memories of burnt animatronics 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:08.340
 After all, he burned them and it was them that he was afraid of and 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:10.019
 he sees them as phantoms 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.239
 agree it would be enough 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.550
 interesting plot that is they 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:17.100
 bind the movie events this 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:20.030
 what is created by scott ie in us three 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.500
 making it feel like this story 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.750
 complements the main story created 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.640
 scott though you can say that all 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.250
 happens in a restaurant after family 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.769
 deiner but it is not so because in this 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.320
 the restaurant was not a foxy and we see how 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:36.660
 Foxy burns so it is not possible 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.549
 option but events after fnaf 3 are unlikely 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.190
 can happen because in fnaf 3 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:43.290
 as we know there was no foxy 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.860
 foxy was not then he could not burn in 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.079
 fire 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:48.420
 which means it is extremely unlikely that events 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:49.950
 will happen after fnaf 3 on this 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.870
 all dear friends hope you 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.870
 good bye good bye good luck
