00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.600
 speaks people beauty mouth in the area and today 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.480
 I'm here to tell you more. 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.830
 once as everyone always hopes to 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.830
 globe paid on the stick, right? 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.830
 Look, it's personal, I confess 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.630
 usually when I see something 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.140
 in this sense it is very difficult indeed 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:27.259
 I see why I do not watch more tv does 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.750
 15 years in the decade many people 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:32.239
 who live with me already know this and one is 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.360
 I use television for two purposes 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:37.129
 only one who plays video games and another 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.320
 purpose that is when the 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:42.500
 football season and I stay 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.659
 connected there on the espn there to watch 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.050
 all games in spite of 

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:52.519
 be a fan of batman unconditional rules 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:54.559
 It is worth so I use my TV for this is 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:57.890
 This is my TV activity and 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:00.019
 I ended up falling silly days and this 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.489
 matter because my wife called the 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:03.530
 Wife said 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.110
 the disk comes here to see such is the movie 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.600
 called I went there to watch but I confess 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.400
 that before this one avoided this video 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.170
 I ended up watching other videos to see 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.290
 the general opinion of the galley 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.060
 I saw the video david jones and I also saw 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.950
 the video of guilherme game by me 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.450
 People that I really like 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.310
 lately we have seen that the 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.829
 old media like david jones himself 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.259
 already spoken in the old media she makes of 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:29.719
 everything to polemize and try to bring 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.250
 the internet audience for her is not 

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:33.229
 positive or negative form that they 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.359
 can do is that business of a 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:39.320
 say bad but talk about me and I think 

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:41.450
 her face globe already has passed the time of 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.759
 understood to understand that no one else 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.329
 Buying this kind of idea is connected. 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.710
 who buys this kind of idea 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:50.420
 usually the kind of people I 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.329
 For example, I'm shitting on him. 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.789
 understood is I know when a person 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:57.859
 come to me please be an addict on this 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:00.649
 game is on and it's a chat I already 

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:02.899
 I stay with my friend celso fini and I 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:04.789
 I do not take it pejoratively despite 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.499
 of not understanding why it leads because 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:08.869
 some cases leads to just what the 

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:10.340
 media made it so I'm a more 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.370
 of old faces when someone was talking 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.319
 who was hooked years ago I was 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.210
 extremely offensive is linked as 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.100
 if you give up your life to do only 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.709
 that and then you end up falling in these 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:24.260
 in these damn extremist cases is 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.360
 on and football the guy spends 500 grand 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.670
 in a game here he has a problem of 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.140
 addiction as if he were an addict in 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.959
 alcohol as if he were an addict in 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.330
 drugs in g1 only this is not the majority and 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.159
 you have not seen a third of what the 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.049
 games can make you beneficial today 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:41.390
 universities and colleges with courses 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:44.870
 turned the games into game journalism 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:47.000
 Do you have companies that invest in 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.580
 production of differentiated content for the 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.799
 game you have people who make content 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.290
 differentiated for me and none of this was 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:58.129
 the fact that the globe has given so much 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:01.909
 emphasis the term online game makes 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:04.069
 she gets all the gamer universe that 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:05.900
 in fact a field is very vast and 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:08.150
 throw everything in the same pan with a fright 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.829
 in the same shit understood that it is totally 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.689
 different than catching a guy playing with 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:14.780
 the solo a guy playing him or a guy 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:16.970
 who plays competitive mode is the guy has 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.439
 a sports team and you 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.269
 just spoke like this ah you are 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:22.849
 all the same expensive and are all the same 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:25.040
 guys just the uninformed staff 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:27.739
 person who is not a member of that 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.000
 gay universe market for they warn that 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.709
 they will have this 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.450
 from now on the guy who plays a 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.610
 competitive is a son of a bitch addict 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.310
 understood that it will sell the priests of the mother 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.959
 He's going to sell his sister there for me. 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.360
 I took my daughter to play. 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:44.239
 anyway the globe just did not do 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.709
 absolutely nothing at all knows why 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:47.659
 because that is precisely what people 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.670
 expecting her has like us the 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:51.950
 We expect nothing other than that in the 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.920
 globe network would have this garbage 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:58.909
 that piece of media that was already 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.500
 Retrograde are already hit is human is 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:02.659
 simply for me it did not give 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.609
 she smelled the goal she only played the role of 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:05.959
 simply dead media 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:09.049
 You're in my friend's opinion. 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:11.840
 dead it may be the biggest network tv 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:13.040
 while digital inclusion was not 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.090
 complete 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.070
 y'know while digital inclusion 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.540
 was not complete in the country at all but all 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.820
 world has mouth access has but does not have 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.049
 information people are dumb 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.910
 digitally speaking 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:25.640
 sorry but this is it when the 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.380
 digital inclusion really does happen 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:31.340
 people are smart enough 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:33.020
 to use the technology in their favor and 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.940
 search information 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.090
 Yes, we will have a change 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:41.180
 starts at school it starts in the family 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:42.830
 Anyway, but I particularly like that. 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.530
 I do not have it at home, do not leave my 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.030
 daughters who on TV open or fucking 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.130
 because I know that this is an example that 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:52.130
 they a teat on they will grow 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:54.170
 frustrated human rights based on a 

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:56.810
 totally unilateral opinion that does not 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:58.520
 saw another side that generalized all that 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.120
 took everything and put it on the same level as 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.760
 switched on 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:04.280
 I as a content producer as well as 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:07.220
 I do not know how my friends like seal like 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.840
 celso fini as the cidÃ£o of the game that makes 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.930
 a time work hooker for example 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:14.000
 game location 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.530
 these guys are all addicts who 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.020
 will spend 500 thousand reais in an online game 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:19.910
 created for the majority of society 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:21.200
 but how do I fuck and walk with the 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.530
 majority of society 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:27.440
 fuck that fucking ball if you believe it 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:30.350
 game is still marginalized is still a 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.580
 thing to be careful I think 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:34.010
 which is the next guy you pick up 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:36.260
 examples are going to be seen in 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:37.550
 every place not only in online play and the network 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.820
 globe took advantage 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:43.970
 It is a time to get there to the town 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:45.350
 from the complaint about rolling money and 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.870
 I do not know what that means 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:49.070
 about mine making village 'to win alone 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.110
 stop inside the game 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:52.700
 my that there already exists a long time and 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.590
 problem in the face not necessarily 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.540
 is related to the whole community 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:59.260
 then this is the big problem of 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:01.850
 The media open to them take one thing 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:03.920
 makes an absurdity and they 

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:06.800
 simply generalize everything is 

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:09.770
 connected to the same globe network and the same 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.780
 that a long time ago made a 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:15.500
 interesting matter as incredible as it 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:17.870
 It seems that the sporting is on. 

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:20.900
