00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:07.300
 this motorcycle runs on hydrogen 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:10.050
 the simplest and most abundant element in the 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.050
 known universe 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.770
 its creators called nba this 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.930
 motorcycle the acronym of vehicle of 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.760
 neutral emissions in English can be 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.640
 prepare a cup of tea with the only 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:29.949
 element that comes out of your exhaust 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.949
 they guessed water 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:38.629
 and what makes it work is this 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:41.010
 small power plant called 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:43.379
 fuel battery 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.079
 produces enough energy to make 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.760
 that the motorcycle works not bad 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.900
 for a machine that can reach the 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.540
 80 kilometers per hour 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.700
 it's okay it's not a rocket 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.240
 but it is driven by the highest 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.240
 technology 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.860
 to the first battery system 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.140
 practical fuel was developed by 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.910
 Nasa at the beginning of the 1960s 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.630
 to generate electricity in the 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.630
 space capsules 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.000
 and a good way to understand the 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.860
 fuel batteries is to see how it 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.460
 produces hydrogen and is quite 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.460
 simple 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.880
 fill a container with water and 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.760
 go through it with a current 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.490
 electrical that this divides hydrogen and 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:35.100
 the oxygen of the water molecule 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.100
 this process is called electrolysis 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.650
 this is the science of the production of 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.320
 hydrogen 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.240
 now if that process is reversed and we see 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:49.160
 how they rejoin hydrogen and the 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:51.940
 oxygen electricity is created water and 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.940
 a little bit of heat 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.540
 but it is not yet a battery of 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.970
 gas 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.960
 they must discover how to take advantage of that 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.960
 electric power 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.750
 and to push this motorcycle you must 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:15.360
 be compact and portable 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.360
 and that's how it works 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.880
 these vents next to the 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.950
 handlebars bring air from outside to the 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.290
 fuel cell attraction 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.210
 between hydrogen and oxygen helps 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:32.280
 that the battery produces electricity 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.280
 and that's thanks to the electrons 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.880
 electricity is simply a 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.290
 electron current function 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.610
 main of a fuel battery 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.610
 is to release them 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.739
 the hydrogen enters the battery of 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.920
 fuel on the left and the 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.720
 oxygen on the right 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.000
 a layer of platinum separates 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.569
 electrons in hydrogen yellow 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.239
 leaving the protons behind 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.969
 both are attracted to oxygen 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:04.520
 other side but to the electrons the 

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:06.230
 stop this membrane 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.520
 now they must find their way 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.920
 return to protons 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.630
 the only way out is through 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.790
 the wires to an electric motor that 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.580
 rotates a drive belt in 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.010
 the rear wheel 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.630
 after going through the engine the 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.340
 electrons continue on their way to the 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.440
 other side of the fuel battery 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.560
 when they meet the protons and 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:31.450
 the oxygen form h2o a soup of 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.450
 chemicals known as water 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:37.220
 that is the only emission that is battery 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.220
 of fuel releases 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.020
 and do not say that this engine looks like 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.540
 of a sewing machine because this 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:46.569
 little one can operate at 60 of 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:50.650
 they 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:53.349
 well the nb is on as we do 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.670
 so that it continues to function as a simple 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:56.560
 fuel battery will continue 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.970
 running as long as you have a 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.520
 hydrogen source 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:04.100
 and when the battery runs out only 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:07.010
 you need a recharge and here's a big 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:11.080
 provision in the university of the fbi 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.080
 england where this prototype was born 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.900
 and fill a fuel battery is 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:23.220
 as exciting as refueling 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.220
 - the vapors 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:29.750
 and unlike motorcycles 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.750
 conventional 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:36.850
 the only sound that you will hear from this 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.850
 machine is the tire on the road 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:44.230
 there are still a few years to see vehicles 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.230
 to hydrogen in the local parking lot 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.430
 but when it happens they can have their 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:52.140
 own fuel battery for 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.140
 load whatever it is wherever 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:57.849
 also a motorcycle
