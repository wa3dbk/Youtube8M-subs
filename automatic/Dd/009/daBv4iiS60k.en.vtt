00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
closet to do this so I was looking at

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.580 
closet to do this so I was looking at

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
this and I was like I wonder what would

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.610 
this and I was like I wonder what would
happen<00:03:07.799> if<00:03:08.160> I<00:03:08.370> got<00:03:08.610> a<00:03:08.880> pressure<00:03:09.599> rod<00:03:10.019> so<00:03:10.349> these

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
happen if I got a pressure rod so these

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.309 
happen if I got a pressure rod so these
are<00:03:10.950> I<00:03:10.980> believe<00:03:11.280> like<00:03:11.760> four<00:03:12.360> dollars<00:03:12.840> or

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
are I believe like four dollars or

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:15.350 
are I believe like four dollars or
something<00:03:13.709> like<00:03:13.890> really<00:03:14.310> unexpensive<00:03:14.790> at

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
something like really unexpensive at

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.270 
something like really unexpensive at
Target<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:16.080> they<00:03:16.290> adjust<00:03:16.830> to<00:03:17.099> whatever

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
Target and they adjust to whatever

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.789 
Target and they adjust to whatever
length<00:03:17.760> you<00:03:17.910> need<00:03:18.209> them<00:03:18.420> to<00:03:18.450> be<00:03:18.630> and<00:03:18.959> then<00:03:19.440> they

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
length you need them to be and then they

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.949 
length you need them to be and then they
work<00:03:20.040> on<00:03:20.220> a<00:03:20.250> spring<00:03:20.820> so<00:03:21.180> they<00:03:21.329> are<00:03:21.390> pressured

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
work on a spring so they are pressured

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.140 
work on a spring so they are pressured
so<00:03:22.440> they're<00:03:22.709> not<00:03:22.890> going<00:03:23.130> to<00:03:23.160> fall<00:03:23.430> off<00:03:23.459> and<00:03:24.000> you

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
so they're not going to fall off and you

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.360 
so they're not going to fall off and you
can<00:03:24.299> adjust<00:03:24.420> them<00:03:24.959> wherever<00:03:25.500> you<00:03:25.829> want<00:03:25.980> them

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370
