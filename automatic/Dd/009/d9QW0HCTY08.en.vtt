00:00:04.149 --> 00:00:07.010
 hello and welcome to this new 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.290
 test today we are in 

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:10.370
 pauline purro pauline company who 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.010
 takes flying of the new renault clio 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:16.720
 iv with its petrol engine of 90 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.720
 horses we go it's gone 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.220
 so paul a fourth generation of 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.250
 clio a brand new car 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.380
 aesthetically how you find it 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:30.050
 I like a lot sell this look a 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.150
 not sporty and its color details 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.850
 and fire one actually notices that 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.840
 the new of the new projectors 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.940
 a lot of space we have small 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.920
 color inserts at the best of the 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.600
 bodywork tip of two profiles like 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.360
 we found it I like these 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.070
 details of two colors and then this 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.629
 new line its new look but 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.220
 made note also on the handle of 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.799
 door does not have the cards it's very 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:55.790
 nice confused in the rear window 

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:57.110
 that's 1 sp1 aspect cut three doors 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.750
 who finishes well behind the car 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.820
 a nice enough look also from back that 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.960
 do small little town car 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:08.180
 why take a look at the left 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:10.700
 we have 300 liters of capacity well 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.820
 enough we can put a lot of 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:19.250
 things in the back very well it's done 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:20.890
 first of all it's gone so we're on a 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.580
 intermediate level of finish 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.520
 how do you find this 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:29.119
 cockpit sporty look a steering wheel 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.080
 small enough and handy keys of 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.960
 colors found as at 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.479
 outside so it's pretty cool this 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.190
 small customizable atmosphere okay 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.750
 and from the point of view of the ergonomics of 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.130
 orders it seems clear to you 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.560
 orders seem clear very 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.470
 simplistic that this is the dashboard 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:49.009
 here where the console the central room at 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:51.440
 radio level so we're on a 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.740
 petrol engine 1 3 cylinders of 90 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.630
 horses 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.110
 how is the present a racing car 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.380
 but pretty much the steering wheel is pretty 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.610
 flexible 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.649
 so she's a little bigger 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.310
 that the old clio so a little time 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.750
 adaptation especially in the city 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.989
 compared to the size of the car 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:11.480
 but simple enough to drive is very 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.530
 nice so how do you find the 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.510
 engine response 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.670
 so she's pretty responsive and pretty 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.580
 nervous so it's still a good 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:23.300
 point for this new clio really 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.890
 this sporty aspect that feels even 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:29.690
 even in the city for short distances 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:30.500
 or small speeds then pauline 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.700
 let it finish 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.800
 what do you have the least 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.810
 enjoyed on this clio iv then the 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.400
 less it's going to be the back space yes and 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.920
 the most this new dynamic line 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.940
 alright thanks for a participation and 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.180
 to next week for a new 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.180
