00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 chosen are included in this video 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.540
 today I wanted to talk about care things that 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.919
 has not yet asked and very much 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.139
 I often do this video 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.450
 so then the crossing hello botta jiao 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.460
 without being there to spend words then 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.500
 photoricatti true to the previous one that like 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.240
 in short, he begins to study criticism in 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.220
 which we recommend a little of things 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.900
 gives you a bit of an overview of the 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.300
 however, you ask me very often 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.859
 marta what you studied I would like 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.640
 interesting to say cinema with mi 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.179
 you recommend 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.279
 I have studied at the Rome dams there are 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.460
 various ganz very often the programs of 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.399
 dams cannero based on university 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.690
 so depending on where you go you will have 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.840
 a different program for how much 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.309
 regards the dams for hours for subjects per 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.840
 so many other things here mine 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.129
 experience if you don't go to mine 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.590
 the same university will not be there much 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.120
 useful in and it is mainly above all 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.410
 that of Rome is purely theoretical 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.789
 so if you want to do good things 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.129
 montado vera because very often vi 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.039
 also writes from things like I would like various 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.620
 codes understands good thing and go lights 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.390
 I can't give you any help except 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.549
 you don't even know what exactly 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.950
 you can do in dances as you can see more 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.380
 theoretical assets for me that I want to do that 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.600
 ridia is perfect though if you want to do it in 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.869
 a shooting montage you want to become 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.729
 magazines downs is not much for you 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.979
 theoretical preparation is fundamental 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.170
 but in my opinion it is not enough for 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.170
 someone wants to make professions 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.670
 which are say more active and actions 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.009
 in short, where you have to try, try 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.280
 try and find out so there are many 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.780
 other schools are center academies 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.030
 many private individuals sincerely not 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.560
 having firsthand experiences 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.450
 because I'm not interested in those 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.860
 sectors I can't tell you which is second 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.409
 me the best because they would be 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.970
 only words from third parties we say 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.350
 I do not trust 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.850
 if someone has made a certain 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.259
 path that the bonfires you made the 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.170
 editor you did a certain 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.060
 route you did the director e 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.070
 you have to share that path you want 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.409
 advise or advise against things 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.899
 of schools for for short but without 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.000
 make insults or private 10 complain 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:06.100
 you are all free to write it here 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.720
 under very often I am asked 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.850
 I am also asked another question 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.220
 I would like to do this brands outlets 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.260
 have already say from a 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.780
 part there is air work because how 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.340
 medical avocado very often you don't find 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.840
 with a profession at the end of yours 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.700
 training course so it means 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.220
 that there was no mine part 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.410
 personal advice seems a 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.269
 path that you like because in my opinion 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.280
 it and do something you like will be 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:32.410
 better for strength because it would put us 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.540
 more kind passion will be less studying 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.250
 that particular thing for longer and 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.840
 so in my opinion you could become a 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.470
 professional, however, this is the 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.060
 my idea 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.220
 this help to do this route i have 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.959
 thought of trying to do something that 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.030
 I liked it and then finally satisfied 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.069
 nun if I can't find anything for nothing 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.019
 do something serious but it's better 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.150
 say I tried it because maybe it does 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.440
 I had a path where he just entered 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.819
 from the university the sector 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.200
 highly requested finished work 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.750
 the university that sector is not shitting 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.700
 more nobody I honestly wouldn't do it 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.980
 for every choice and I was not concerned 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.570
 I can decide for you I'm interviewed 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.130
 a little bit of help though obviously the 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.890
 my other advice is that once 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.730
 you are not finished 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.400
 perfect 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.700
 you must continue to continue 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.450
 because in my opinion it never ends 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.579
 go deeper you never get to 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.350
 core of the issue especially in 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:22.510
 determined in almost all sectors 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.700
 perhaps there is always a discovery but also 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.070
 if we talk about covers, study the discoveries 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.200
 thousand years ago there is always a discovery e 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.630
 so neither that you can say I did I am 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.470
 came to put feet on the table and 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.239
 who cares 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.100
 in short, these things if you want 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.109
 share your experience i am 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.609
 here thanks again for seeing this 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:40.840
 Video I hope to have been of help 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:43.650
 someone and see you next 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.650
