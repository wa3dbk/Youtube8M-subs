00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.090

 sibling is the red carpet 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:52.770
 rolled out and chilled ice 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.290

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.379
 avant-garde offer of hit 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.979
 line and giftware 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.610
 so individuality and and 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.990
 Something extraordinary is somehow 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.430
 always been my faible and me 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.229
 found that missing here in brÃ¼hl 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.450
 I think that many here 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.460
 gift shops are but rather 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.109
 address the audience in the law and 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.869
 Do not really stop young people between 

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:22.979
 16 and mid 20 and that stops 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.600
 thought here you really find 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.939
 the small things you on one time 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.619
 can give away to a party 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.810
 reasonable price and does not have to 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.649
 to cologne or hear or another 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.179

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:34.920

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.280
 bitten like the grandma has what she 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.350
 usually with a kukident in the evening 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.759
 tablet standing on dessert in glass 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.939

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.729
 out 

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:56.759
 the fashion show of the fashion label 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:59.290
 sibling is opened like this 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.620
 this lifestyle comes over as well 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:05.310
 german chic just every part tells 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.310
 a story of its own 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.870
 st 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:30.470
 it is the brand yesterday that is 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.470
 fantastic quality in germany 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.420
 that actually has as produced 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.040
 small designer label started and is 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.989
 Meanwhile, to a huge 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.849
 brand has become a giant 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.069
 fan base and makes very much 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:44.989
 individual things with a lot of love 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.060
 to detail and really really high 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.280
 level so mad great substances 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.540
 super processed 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.819
 that's actually mine 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.209
 filming there are still 667 baby 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:58.209
 of the beast that is also in Germany 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:58.209
 produced 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.530
 Left 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.480
 For the customers, I think more and more important 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.220
 that the products are also in germany 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.750
 be made because they are a bit 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.220
 Maybe its just at 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.510
 Children's things I think that's synonymous 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.250
 very important because they are not 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.200
 something are loaded but that is 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.959
 really cotton everything organic 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.760
 the prints are just great that it is not 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.110
 china import where you just do not know what 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:04:01.140
 for toxins are still in there and 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:04:08.459
 what can i do with my child then 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:11.069
 everything is very very qualitative 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:13.560
 high quality and that was actually 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:15.390
 deliberately not so planned but so im 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.049
 after all, I think that takes everything 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.690
 in one another 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.910
 that really stops here 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.470
 Usually they will not be so 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.400
 You can really do that on the internet 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.080
 to order 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.180
 is also available in cologne in the pallets 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.870
 but have half siblings here in the 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.870
 There's no such thing
