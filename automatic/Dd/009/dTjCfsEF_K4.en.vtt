what did come down this week was the

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.630 
what did come down this week was the

behind me I'd always kind of assumed

eternity<00:00:35.610> but<00:00:36.390> that's<00:00:36.690> clearly<00:00:36.989> not<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.320> case

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
eternity but that's clearly not the case

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.500 
eternity but that's clearly not the case
it<00:00:37.739> needs<00:00:37.920> some<00:00:38.100> care<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:38.820> maintenance<00:00:39.120> and

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
it needs some care and maintenance and

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.810 
it needs some care and maintenance and
actually<00:00:40.320> if<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.469> look<00:00:40.500> behind<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.610> boom

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
actually if you look behind the boom

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.270 
actually if you look behind the boom
just<00:00:42.719> where<00:00:42.899> it<00:00:43.620> intersects<00:00:44.070> with<00:00:44.190> the

just where it intersects with the

just where it intersects with the

horizon it's a clear day today and you

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.040 
horizon it's a clear day today and you

anyway here is Meredith talking about

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.069 
anyway here is Meredith talking about
this<00:00:55.980> particular<00:00:56.219> power<00:00:56.820> system<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.480> hope<00:00:57.960> you

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
this particular power system I hope you

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.889 
this particular power system I hope you
enjoy<00:00:58.940> on<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.180> north<00:01:00.359> end<00:01:00.539> of<00:01:00.690> Haida<00:01:00.840> Gwaii

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
enjoy on the north end of Haida Gwaii

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.810 
enjoy on the north end of Haida Gwaii
appear<00:01:01.289> we're<00:01:01.440> primarily<00:01:01.649> on<00:01:02.070> diesel<00:01:02.309> that's

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
appear we're primarily on diesel that's

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.050 
appear we're primarily on diesel that's
the<00:01:02.969> only<00:01:03.180> source<00:01:03.449> of<00:01:03.750> electricity<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.769> so<00:01:05.549> we

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
the only source of electricity and so we

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.179 
the only source of electricity and so we
are<00:01:06.390> sort<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.080> in<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.260> desperate<00:01:07.710> race<00:01:07.740> right

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
are sort of in a desperate race right

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.580 
are sort of in a desperate race right
now<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.369> feel<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:09.150> start<00:01:09.630> coming<00:01:10.140> up<00:01:10.260> with

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
now I feel to start coming up with

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.429 
now I feel to start coming up with
solutions<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.939> are<00:01:12.060> more<00:01:12.450> sustainable<00:01:12.810> and

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
solutions that are more sustainable and

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.130 
solutions that are more sustainable and
long<00:01:14.130> term<00:01:14.369> because<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.360> diesel<00:01:15.659> is<00:01:15.780> probably

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
long term because the diesel is probably

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.690 
long term because the diesel is probably
not<00:01:16.350> going<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.530> be<00:01:16.619> coming<00:01:16.920> shipped<00:01:17.189> across<00:01:17.340> on

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
not going to be coming shipped across on

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.249 
not going to be coming shipped across on
barges<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.330> heck<00:01:18.479> it's<00:01:18.659> straight<00:01:18.900> forever

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
barges the heck it's straight forever

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.410 
barges the heck it's straight forever
and<00:01:19.560> we<00:01:20.070> should<00:01:20.250> probably<00:01:20.430> be<00:01:20.640> prepared<00:01:21.240> for

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
and we should probably be prepared for

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.539 
and we should probably be prepared for
that<00:01:21.540> Nevitt<00:01:21.840> ability<00:01:22.229> I<00:01:22.409> so<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.189> couple<00:01:23.400> of

you've<00:01:46.560> got<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.770> good<00:01:46.950> balance<00:01:47.369> of<00:01:47.490> systems<00:01:47.970> and

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
you've got a good balance of systems and

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.600 
you've got a good balance of systems and

their house would have been way more

interesting things that resulted from

interesting things that resulted from
this<00:02:50.400> is<00:02:50.700> they<00:02:51.329> seem<00:02:51.510> to<00:02:51.660> have<00:02:51.780> developed<00:02:52.110> even

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
this is they seem to have developed even

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.080 
this is they seem to have developed even
more<00:02:52.500> of<00:02:52.799> an<00:02:53.040> ecological<00:02:53.340> consciousness

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
more of an ecological consciousness

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.150 
more of an ecological consciousness
which<00:02:54.540> is<00:02:54.569> extending<00:02:55.230> further<00:02:55.620> out<00:02:55.829> for<00:02:56.040> them

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
which is extending further out for them

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.559 
which is extending further out for them
in<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.370> community<00:02:56.790> and<00:02:56.910> I<00:02:57.000> think<00:02:57.030> that's<00:02:57.329> one

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
in the community and I think that's one

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.720 
in the community and I think that's one
of<00:02:57.599> the<00:02:57.890> most<00:02:58.890> important<00:02:59.310> things<00:02:59.519> that's

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
of the most important things that's

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.690 
of the most important things that's
happening<00:03:00.150> here<00:03:00.180> people<00:03:00.720> can<00:03:01.019> see<00:03:01.319> that<00:03:02.250> the

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
happening here people can see that the

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.550 
happening here people can see that the
solutions<00:03:03.180> exist<00:03:03.450> and<00:03:03.930> that<00:03:04.019> the<00:03:04.110> solutions

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
solutions exist and that the solutions

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.289

are effective and all we need to do now

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.600 
are effective and all we need to do now
is<00:03:06.720> employ<00:03:07.290> these<00:03:07.530> solutions<00:03:07.799> on<00:03:08.190> a<00:03:08.220> bigger
