underneath<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.940> boss<00:00:42.300> as<00:00:42.690> he's<00:00:42.899> being<00:00:43.079> kyden

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
underneath the boss as he's being kyden

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.119

he<00:00:44.190> has<00:00:44.399> like<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.670> little<00:00:44.820> purple<00:00:45.860> circle<00:00:46.860> I

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
he has like a little purple circle I

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.860 
he has like a little purple circle I
guess<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:48.180> don't<00:00:48.360> want<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.539> get<00:00:48.660> under

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
guess and you don't want to get under

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.660 
guess and you don't want to get under
that<00:00:48.899> because<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.440> I<00:00:49.620> think<00:00:50.370> that's<00:00:50.520> what

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
that because it I think that's what

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.060 
that because it I think that's what
causes<00:00:50.969> him<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.120> crush<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.809> that<00:00:52.440> is<00:00:52.739> not<00:00:53.010> good

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
causes him to crush and that is not good

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.889 
causes him to crush and that is not good
so<00:00:53.489> you<00:00:53.579> don't<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.850> do<00:00:53.910> that<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.270> then<00:00:54.780> you

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
so you don't to do that and then you

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.260 
so you don't to do that and then you
have<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.739> dps<00:00:56.250> those<00:00:56.520> are<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.699> ones<00:00:56.820> dropping

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
have to dps those are the ones dropping

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.639 
have to dps those are the ones dropping
the<00:00:57.390> fair<00:00:57.600> moines<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.079> fair<00:00:58.530> pheromones<00:00:59.520> mm

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
the fair moines the fair pheromones mm

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:03.709 
the fair moines the fair pheromones mm
outside<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.280> area<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.239> that's<00:01:03.420> what<00:01:03.600> the

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
outside of the area and that's what the

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.299 
outside of the area and that's what the
little<00:01:03.899> yellow<00:01:04.229> puddles<00:01:04.739> are<00:01:04.890> so<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.189> don't

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
little yellow puddles are so you don't

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.350 
little yellow puddles are so you don't
want<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.489> stand<00:01:05.580> in<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.820> puddles<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.240> you

tank<00:01:10.619> I'm<00:01:11.490> not<00:01:11.790> completely<00:01:12.119> positive<00:01:12.500> it's<00:01:13.500> a

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
tank I'm not completely positive it's a

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.350 
tank I'm not completely positive it's a
very<00:01:13.740> intense<00:01:14.100> fight<00:01:14.400> especially<00:01:14.970> for

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
very intense fight especially for

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.730 
very intense fight especially for
looking<00:01:15.600> for<00:01:15.750> eight<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.049> it's<00:01:16.200> also<00:01:16.380> already

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
looking for eight and it's also already

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.740 
looking for eight and it's also already
been<00:01:17.070> nerfed<00:01:17.340> but<00:01:17.790> even<00:01:18.090> after<00:01:18.240> being<00:01:18.390> nerve

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
been nerfed but even after being nerve

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.179 
been nerfed but even after being nerve
it's<00:01:19.020> still<00:01:19.320> pretty<00:01:20.090> pretty<00:01:21.090> insane<00:01:22.189> despite

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
it's still pretty pretty insane despite

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.969 
it's still pretty pretty insane despite
its<00:01:23.430> sped<00:01:24.210> up<00:01:24.360> as<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.630> can<00:01:24.780> tell<00:01:24.979> hopefully

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
its sped up as you can tell hopefully

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:26.780 
its sped up as you can tell hopefully
while<00:01:26.130> you're<00:01:26.220> watching<00:01:26.340> this<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:26.700> don't

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
while you're watching this you don't

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.870

think<00:01:26.939> I<00:01:27.030> play<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.360> quickly<00:01:28.220> but<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.250> took<00:01:29.700> us

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
think I play that quickly but it took us

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.670 
think I play that quickly but it took us
about<00:01:30.060> 30<00:01:30.420> minutes<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:31.250> do<00:01:32.250> three<00:01:32.850> fights<00:01:33.090> so

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
about 30 minutes to do three fights so

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.109 
about 30 minutes to do three fights so
and<00:01:34.680> on<00:01:34.799> our<00:01:34.950> third<00:01:34.979> trial<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.640> don't<00:01:35.820> like<00:01:35.970> it

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
and on our third trial you don't like it

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.179 
and on our third trial you don't like it
to<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.329> butt<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.409> even<00:01:37.560> got<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.799> chest<00:01:38.040> piece
