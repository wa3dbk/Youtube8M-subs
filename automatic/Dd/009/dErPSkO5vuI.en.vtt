00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.950
 in this video I would like to talk about something so much where at the same time so much 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.710
 undervalued ie the frequency of the correct technique at the base of the 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.480
 grimaldi productive training I trust the previous one with regards to the choice 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:22.039
 description of the best training methods to achieve results for 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:23.480
 as short as possible 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.270
 first of all I would like to dwell for a moment on the seriousness of making balotelli look 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:28.979
 for a specific wood 

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:32.830
 most of you just entered the gyms known destroyer 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.890
 will have started with the first card 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.680
 generally the same for everyone where all of them were trained in one session 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.870
 muscle districts doing classical exercises for seriousness 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.400
 duct t5 12 repetition 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.270
 resurrected gyms is recommended to be performed with the frequency all by itself 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:50.200
 the week 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.150
 novadent every other day 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.620
 open immediately noticed that in the first two weeks the blow 2 responded well ibus 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.660
 kuduro become harder marked 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.670
 the shirt of the heart we begin to become tight 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.520
 of course since it turns out that only one code arrived to stop 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.580
 instant to think why the post instructor had given him 3 series for 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.410
 exercise from 8 10 or 12 repetition 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.410
 all this turned out to be simply normal 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.730
 after the first results here you seem to have started to slow down 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.970
 the desire to go to the gym that before was great start now decrease 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.810
 ibus to whom I am no longer so think you hard and indeed started to get the feeling 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.310
 get worse instead of continuing to improve 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.860
 at this point you talk to your agreed facilities that absolutely 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.370
 need to change the card 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.110
 pass here the basket where he had done in the whole body with the frequency of 3 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.430
 days the week nature where you split the body into two districts 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.490
 muscle with the classic frequency ie Monday and Tuesday Thursday 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.280
 Friday 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.140
 work out 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.750
 and Wednesday Saturday and Sunday rest 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.370
 the body is this rome network card face generally in two sections from 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:55.790
 train 2 very hard 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.240
 in the same week 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.390
 naturally to say said that defends you the body in two sections e 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.909
 wanting to continue growing 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.340
 you will also have to increase wolf rhode exercises included in the repetitions of 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.470
 this is normal 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.860
 touran for your entire life been told that most do the texts anymore 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.660
 you will get 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.680
 so why the body should avoid this very important one 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.379
 popular maxim 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.379
 also if you started with two exercises for the pectorals 

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:23.770
 however enduro you were doing to insert 10 repetitions 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.999
 - you are holding back results and it is very clear and logical 

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:30.159
 that to continue to grow you will absolutely have to increase your exercises 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:31.059
 at least 3 

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:35.289
 the 4 series maybe change the number of repetitions per series by running 

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:36.429
 pyramidal 

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:38.809
 fine network what the problem is 

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:41.889
 I start again with calm bitch of one of the mice exposed above 

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:44.379
 it no longer seems logical to me 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:47.120
 the euro lint that starts from scratch 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.319
 starting from an exercise curuli cashier depentor mind if it does not work pass 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.569
 later 2 or 3 serial 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.019
 how can we define how many series do 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:59.949
 if we leave immediately for three or four per year 

00:02:59.949 --> 00:03:03.219
 it is clear that with this approach the only viable route if not 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:06.079
 we have results and that of continuing to have to talk 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:07.949
 concert to diminish them 

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:11.549
 do you remember when in previous articles ticino that to stimulate the 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:12.769
 muscle growth 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.849
 it was not the amount of exercise performed by the individual unit of time piero 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:17.709
 important 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.189
 but the intensity 

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:22.189
 second error the frequency for one session and the next 

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:26.109
 if we start from the scientifically proven assumption that the resources 

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.620
 the physical resources available are so many 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.399
 bed and see that before going back to training 

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:34.889
 alpen the compensation reconstruction processes must have been 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:38.789
 bring and if we want it also processes supercompensation or muscle growth 

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:41.689
 if they happen we will have to add a few extra days 

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:44.559
 then to define the training frequency 

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:48.439
 we can only use a meter that measures your faces the post i 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:51.160
 results in adaptive terms stress a place 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.679
 from training specs 

00:03:52.679 --> 00:03:56.069
 in other words, start the training before he could give more than 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.740
 repair have ended 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.440
 leads to the tube rai gradually overtraining or loosening or 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.129
 termination the second of the gravity of muscle growth 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:08.740
 so how do we know when to do the next workout 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.930
 there are two ways fiuggi pizza with my customers the first add about two 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.380
 extra recovery days 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.810
 from the moment of sex he has too much muscle pain from his last training session 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.009
 moment that we will return to train 

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:24.729
 the second one is the recording on a training diary of which actions 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:29.669
 to rise of the various types vivaldi loads and of the repetitions carried out 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:33.860
 yes you got it right if the first supercompensation compensation processes 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.490
 then they came 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.849
 we will have to be stronger from the previous time 

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:42.860
 then pulling the sums of what exposed bed and laugh that there is no 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.669
 fixed training day but must be defined from time to time in 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:48.860
 based on our resilience 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.850
 such capacities its network influences by many factors including genetics the 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:56.009
 type of power supply integration we are using 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:04:59.270
 the kind of work we do every day other sports we practice 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:02.680
 possibly yahoo use of anabolic steroids 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.749
 all these factors affecting Caribbean cronies 

00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:08.749
 on the choice of the frequency our training should have 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.550
 a question that is often asked to me is the following 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.250
 but if yesterday furnished chest shoulders ebus triceps those of the next 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:17.680
 training are the legs 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.240
 what need is there to rest many days since I will go to later 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.629
 train muscles in areas of the body distinct from the first 

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:28.370
 here too the basic error is to see the whole body by sectors 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.270
 and not as on. 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.099
 we want to simplify the value of 100 units to our capabilities 

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:35.080
 recovery 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.720
 if I have already trained chest shoulders triceps in the following days 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.159
 I don't return to train 

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:42.480
 all the 100 units I have 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.120
 will be employed by my body to carry out the processes of 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.250
 supercompensation compensation 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:50.659
 until they are finished 

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:54.479
 if instead of city, if instead we say day after, I decide to train the 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:56.889
 quadriceps hamstrings calves 

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:59.740
 because my body had not yet finished the processes of 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:03.900
 chest shoulder repair triceps will now be found where the activity of the 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.330
 initial 100 units 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:07.969
 you remember you endure me 

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:11.550
 also with the quadriceps femoral biceps and calves finished cap 

00:06:11.549 --> 00:06:12.369
 train 

00:06:12.369 --> 00:06:16.780
 thus increasing recovery times if they had been 4 days before 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.009
 now they will have to become at least d8 

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:23.169
 if then, before the end of the eight days, I decided to raise it 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:25.310
 abdomen biceps completing so 

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:26.500
 the turn of the muscles 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.540
 our tiscali 100 rita now should be further 

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:30.860
 divided 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.900
 thus extending our recovery times once again 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:38.729
 it is clear from what has been said up to here psp how easy it is to cross systems ad 

00:06:38.729 --> 00:06:40.449
 high volume 1 eng 

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:44.400
 arrive also for correlative breeding very fast arrest in 

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.559
 muscle growth 

00:06:45.559 --> 00:06:49.139
 hence the need to create the training microcycle 

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:50.979
 at low intensity 

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:54.900
 so as to allow short to recover after long periods of stress 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:56.759
 weight for training 

00:06:56.759 --> 00:06:57.849
 remember 

00:06:57.849 --> 00:07:01.900
 if you wax it enough time your body will finish around workout 

00:07:01.899 --> 00:07:04.899
 then all the compensation processes are compensated 

00:07:05.619 --> 00:07:08.990
 you will never have to show you recovery cycles 

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:11.979
 as muscle growth as a tan 

00:07:11.979 --> 00:07:16.229
 it is a continuous and constant process of physical adaptation to a stress in 

00:07:16.229 --> 00:07:17.119
 port 

00:07:17.119 --> 00:07:19.639
 this process will end when 

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:23.090
 your maximum potential for genetic development will be achieved 

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:26.210
 which of course varies from person to person 

00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:29.699
 I hope with this article to have clarified other aspects relating to the 

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:33.589
 training and the processes involved in muscle growth 

00:07:33.589 --> 00:07:37.489
 keep following me the aspects to subscribe to my boudin newspaper feed 

00:07:37.489 --> 00:07:38.289
 Sun 

00:07:38.289 --> 00:07:39.139
 I'll see you 

00:07:39.139 --> 00:07:40.070
 in the next video
