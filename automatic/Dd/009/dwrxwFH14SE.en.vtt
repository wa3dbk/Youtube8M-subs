00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:05.919 
that someone does have to be cut away it

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:08.999 
that someone does have to be cut away it
looks<00:06:06.159> like<00:06:06.509> and<00:06:07.509> a<00:06:07.930> commitment<00:06:08.259> or<00:06:08.590> promise

00:06:08.999 --> 00:06:09.009 
looks like and a commitment or promise

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:11.730 
looks like and a commitment or promise
or<00:06:09.310> something<00:06:09.789> new<00:06:10.690> has<00:06:10.960> to<00:06:10.990> come<00:06:11.319> now<00:06:11.500> some

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:11.740 
or something new has to come now some

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.950 
or something new has to come now some
people<00:06:11.889> will<00:06:12.129> read<00:06:12.370> it<00:06:12.550> this<00:06:13.060> modifies<00:06:13.659> this

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960 
people will read it this modifies this

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.869 
people will read it this modifies this
so<00:06:14.919> would<00:06:15.039> be<00:06:15.129> a<00:06:15.159> cutting<00:06:15.520> away<00:06:15.639> of<00:06:15.819> a

00:06:15.869 --> 00:06:15.879 
so would be a cutting away of a

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:18.809 
so would be a cutting away of a
commitment<00:06:16.240> I<00:06:16.960> tend<00:06:17.710> to<00:06:17.770> read<00:06:18.009> it<00:06:18.129> more<00:06:18.250> as<00:06:18.430> you

00:06:18.809 --> 00:06:18.819 
commitment I tend to read it more as you

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:20.670 
commitment I tend to read it more as you
have<00:06:18.940> to<00:06:19.060> cut<00:06:19.270> something<00:06:19.569> and<00:06:20.229> then<00:06:20.379> you<00:06:20.500> have

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:20.680 
have to cut something and then you have

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.010 
have to cut something and then you have
to<00:06:20.830> make<00:06:20.979> a<00:06:21.009> commitment<00:06:21.340> either<00:06:22.330> way<00:06:22.599> may<00:06:22.840> make

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:23.020 
to make a commitment either way may make

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.830 
to make a commitment either way may make
sense<00:06:23.289> to<00:06:23.500> you<00:06:23.620> but<00:06:23.860> this<00:06:24.819> has<00:06:25.090> to<00:06:25.240> do<00:06:25.389> is<00:06:25.599> it

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 
sense to you but this has to do is it

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.490 
sense to you but this has to do is it
kind<00:06:26.050> of<00:06:26.189> harvesting<00:06:27.189> what<00:06:27.370> you<00:06:27.520> got<00:06:28.440> making<00:06:29.440> a

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:29.500 
kind of harvesting what you got making a

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.589 
kind of harvesting what you got making a
promise<00:06:29.919> so<00:06:30.580> you<00:06:30.639> may<00:06:31.000> have<00:06:31.180> to<00:06:31.270> have<00:06:31.330> either

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:31.599 
promise so you may have to have either

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:33.510 
promise so you may have to have either
new<00:06:31.810> that<00:06:31.990> new<00:06:32.169> person<00:06:32.469> come<00:06:32.830> in<00:06:32.979> cut<00:06:33.430> out

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 
new that new person come in cut out

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.670 
new that new person come in cut out
doing<00:06:33.849> it<00:06:33.940> by<00:06:34.090> yourself<00:06:34.210> and<00:06:35.020> make<00:06:35.229> a<00:06:35.259> promise

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:35.680 
doing it by yourself and make a promise

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.600 
doing it by yourself and make a promise
or<00:06:35.800> a<00:06:35.860> commitment<00:06:36.129> or<00:06:36.460> you<00:06:37.120> may<00:06:37.270> have<00:06:37.449> to

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:38.610
