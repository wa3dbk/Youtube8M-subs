so<00:00:05.840> first<00:00:06.259> off<00:00:06.439> the<00:00:06.589> bat<00:00:06.740> for<00:00:06.950> CP<00:00:07.250> plus<00:00:07.459> the<00:00:07.790> new

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:07.990 
so first off the bat for CP plus the new

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.200 
so first off the bat for CP plus the new
x100s<00:00:08.990> from<00:00:09.350> Fuji<00:00:09.800> it<00:00:10.010> feels<00:00:10.340> pretty<00:00:11.000> much

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:11.210 
x100s from Fuji it feels pretty much

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.590 
x100s from Fuji it feels pretty much
exactly<00:00:11.480> the<00:00:11.720> same<00:00:11.990> as<00:00:12.230> the<00:00:12.260> x100<00:00:13.250> as<00:00:14.120> the<00:00:14.420> lady

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:14.600 
exactly the same as the x100 as the lady

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.209 
exactly the same as the x100 as the lady
pointed<00:00:14.960> out<00:00:15.080> the<00:00:15.200> only<00:00:15.440> thing<00:00:15.650> outwardly

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:16.219 
pointed out the only thing outwardly

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.090 
pointed out the only thing outwardly
different<00:00:16.640> is<00:00:16.789> the<00:00:17.300> S<00:00:17.449> on<00:00:17.779> the<00:00:17.840> front<00:00:18.350> they

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.100 
different is the S on the front they

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.620 
different is the S on the front they
don't<00:00:19.310> actually<00:00:19.490> have<00:00:19.790> it<00:00:19.940> on<00:00:20.060> Stan<00:00:20.420> to

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:20.630 
don't actually have it on Stan to

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.600 
don't actually have it on Stan to
compare<00:00:20.960> side-by-side<00:00:21.170> though<00:00:21.800> but<00:00:22.310> the

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:22.610 
compare side-by-side though but the

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.900 
compare side-by-side though but the
build<00:00:22.880> feels<00:00:23.150> just<00:00:23.539> as<00:00:23.720> nice<00:00:23.930> in<00:00:24.890> terms<00:00:25.789> of

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
build feels just as nice in terms of

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.730 
build feels just as nice in terms of
controls<00:00:26.360> pretty<00:00:26.750> much<00:00:26.930> the<00:00:27.140> same<00:00:27.289> as<00:00:27.530> well

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
controls pretty much the same as well

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.810 
controls pretty much the same as well
the<00:00:28.420> viewfinder<00:00:29.420> is<00:00:30.160> the<00:00:31.160> resolution<00:00:31.490> is

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
the viewfinder is the resolution is

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.509 
the viewfinder is the resolution is
higher<00:00:32.119> but<00:00:32.449> switching<00:00:32.809> from<00:00:33.339> optical<00:00:34.339> to

00:00:34.509 --> 00:00:34.519 
higher but switching from optical to

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:37.270 
higher but switching from optical to
electronic<00:00:35.059> is<00:00:35.179> certainly<00:00:35.620> extremely<00:00:36.620> fast

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
electronic is certainly extremely fast

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.180 
electronic is certainly extremely fast
and<00:00:37.550> smooth<00:00:37.879> I<00:00:38.870> would<00:00:39.289> still<00:00:39.499> much<00:00:39.710> prefer<00:00:40.039> to

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:40.190 
and smooth I would still much prefer to

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.520 
and smooth I would still much prefer to
use<00:00:40.339> the<00:00:40.579> optical<00:00:41.179> but<00:00:41.420> the<00:00:41.690> the<00:00:41.989> digital<00:00:42.379> one

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
use the optical but the the digital one

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.489 
use the optical but the the digital one
does<00:00:42.829> come<00:00:43.699> on<00:00:43.850> quickly<00:00:44.149> and<00:00:44.539> you<00:00:45.199> have<00:00:45.350> to

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:45.499 
does come on quickly and you have to

00:00:45.499 --> 00:00:47.349 
does come on quickly and you have to
move<00:00:45.649> pretty<00:00:45.920> quickly<00:00:46.219> to<00:00:46.519> get<00:00:46.699> it<00:00:46.850> to<00:00:47.030> have<00:00:47.329> a

00:00:47.349 --> 00:00:47.359 
move pretty quickly to get it to have a

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:49.719 
move pretty quickly to get it to have a
lag<00:00:47.629> showing<00:00:48.109> up<00:00:48.370> unfortunately<00:00:49.370> it's<00:00:49.519> got<00:00:49.639> to

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:49.729 
lag showing up unfortunately it's got to

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:51.729 
lag showing up unfortunately it's got to
be<00:00:49.819> sampled<00:00:50.659> stamped<00:00:51.139> on<00:00:51.229> the<00:00:51.350> base<00:00:51.530> plate

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 
be sampled stamped on the base plate

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:53.439 
be sampled stamped on the base plate
here<00:00:52.010> so<00:00:52.190> we<00:00:52.309> can't<00:00:52.519> actually<00:00:52.639> put<00:00:52.909> a<00:00:53.059> card<00:00:53.329> in

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:53.449 
here so we can't actually put a card in

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:55.329 
here so we can't actually put a card in
this<00:00:53.600> one<00:00:53.809> and<00:00:53.929> test<00:00:54.199> it<00:00:54.350> out<00:00:54.469> please<00:00:54.859> come<00:00:55.159> out

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:55.339 
this one and test it out please come out

00:00:55.339 --> 00:01:01.299 
this one and test it out please come out
end<00:00:55.609> of<00:00:55.909> febuary<00:00:58.510> okay<00:00:59.510> and<00:00:59.749> same<00:01:00.709> for<00:01:01.069> this

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309 
end of febuary okay and same for this

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.869 
end of febuary okay and same for this
one<00:01:01.370> yeah<00:01:01.819> okay<00:01:02.389> and<00:01:02.690> so<00:01:03.649> also<00:01:03.920> the<00:01:04.220> x20<00:01:04.729> so

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
one yeah okay and so also the x20 so

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.910 
one yeah okay and so also the x20 so
both<00:01:05.089> of<00:01:05.120> these<00:01:05.449> now<00:01:05.690> are<00:01:05.869> rocking<00:01:06.289> x-trans

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
both of these now are rocking x-trans

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.249 
both of these now are rocking x-trans
sensors<00:01:07.700> that<00:01:08.000> were<00:01:08.240> originally<00:01:08.509> only<00:01:08.899> in<00:01:09.170> the

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:09.259 
sensors that were originally only in the

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:13.630 
sensors that were originally only in the
X<00:01:09.289> Pro<00:01:09.619> 1<00:01:09.890> series<00:01:10.369> I<00:01:10.960> mean<00:01:11.960> this<00:01:12.280> well<00:01:13.280> we'll

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
X Pro 1 series I mean this well we'll

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.340 
X Pro 1 series I mean this well we'll
have<00:01:13.729> to<00:01:13.789> see<00:01:13.939> but<00:01:14.119> you<00:01:14.750> would<00:01:14.899> expect<00:01:15.229> that

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
have to see but you would expect that

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.170 
have to see but you would expect that
the<00:01:15.500> image<00:01:15.740> quality<00:01:15.950> coming<00:01:16.369> up<00:01:16.460> x<00:01:16.729> 20<00:01:17.090> is

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
the image quality coming up x 20 is

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.050 
the image quality coming up x 20 is
going<00:01:17.450> to<00:01:17.570> exceed<00:01:18.020> the<00:01:18.469> original<00:01:18.920> x<00:01:19.100> 100<00:01:19.759> even

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
going to exceed the original x 100 even

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.090 
going to exceed the original x 100 even
though<00:01:20.119> it's<00:01:20.270> a<00:01:20.359> smaller<00:01:20.630> sensor<00:01:21.259> and<00:01:21.500> then

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
though it's a smaller sensor and then

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.060 
though it's a smaller sensor and then
this<00:01:22.310> one<00:01:22.369> should<00:01:22.909> be<00:01:22.939> exceeding<00:01:23.719> the<00:01:24.259> x<00:01:24.680> pro

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
this one should be exceeding the x pro

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.580 
this one should be exceeding the x pro
one<00:01:25.579> in<00:01:25.909> terms<00:01:26.180> of<00:01:26.270> image<00:01:26.509> quality<00:01:26.750> both<00:01:27.109> aps-c

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
one in terms of image quality both aps-c

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.620 
one in terms of image quality both aps-c
this<00:01:28.039> one's<00:01:28.250> a<00:01:28.369> second<00:01:28.729> generation<00:01:28.820> of<00:01:29.420> x

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
this one's a second generation of x

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.200 
this one's a second generation of x
trends<00:01:30.109> technology<00:01:30.890> so<00:01:31.210> certainly

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
trends technology so certainly

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.810 
trends technology so certainly
interesting<00:01:33.039> yeah<00:01:34.039> so<00:01:34.460> very<00:01:34.640> nice

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
interesting yeah so very nice

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.669 
interesting yeah so very nice
unfortunately<00:01:35.630> kicking<00:01:36.170> it<00:01:36.259> off<00:01:36.320> with<00:01:36.380> one

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:36.679 
unfortunately kicking it off with one

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:38.950 
unfortunately kicking it off with one
that<00:01:36.799> we<00:01:36.890> can't<00:01:37.070> actually<00:01:37.280> test<00:01:38.210> and<00:01:38.630> show<00:01:38.899> you

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
that we can't actually test and show you

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.440 
that we can't actually test and show you
sample<00:01:39.380> images<00:01:39.740> but<00:01:40.429> I<00:01:40.789> know<00:01:41.000> there's<00:01:41.299> a<00:01:41.329> lot

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
sample images but I know there's a lot

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:42.580 
sample images but I know there's a lot
of<00:01:41.479> people<00:01:41.780> hanging<00:01:42.020> out<00:01:42.079> for<00:01:42.259> this<00:01:42.350> one<00:01:42.560> so

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
of people hanging out for this one so

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:43.899 
of people hanging out for this one so
you<00:01:42.740> can<00:01:42.799> at<00:01:42.950> least<00:01:42.979> rest<00:01:43.340> assured<00:01:43.640> that<00:01:43.670> the

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
you can at least rest assured that the

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.179 
you can at least rest assured that the
optical<00:01:44.270> viewfinder<00:01:44.719> is<00:01:44.749> good<00:01:45.020> and<00:01:45.229> that<00:01:45.289> the

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
optical viewfinder is good and that the

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:47.739 
optical viewfinder is good and that the
build<00:01:46.549> quality<00:01:46.670> is<00:01:46.939> just<00:01:47.179> as<00:01:47.329> good<00:01:47.479> as<00:01:47.630> the

00:01:47.739 --> 00:01:47.749 
build quality is just as good as the

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:49.359 
build quality is just as good as the
original<00:01:47.780> you'll<00:01:48.439> have<00:01:48.590> to<00:01:48.740> wait<00:01:48.859> a<00:01:48.890> month<00:01:49.130> for
