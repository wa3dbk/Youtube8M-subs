preservers<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:24.779> you<00:00:25.710> know<00:00:25.859> I<00:00:26.039> once<00:00:26.580> they<00:00:26.670> got

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
preservers and you know I once they got

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:27.920 
preservers and you know I once they got
the<00:00:27.029> edge<00:00:27.119> of<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.300> pool<00:00:27.420> would<00:00:27.689> be<00:00:27.720> very

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
the edge of the pool would be very

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.830 
the edge of the pool would be very
hesitant<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.500> jump<00:00:28.740> in<00:00:28.949> so<00:00:29.789> I<00:00:30.210> started

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
hesitant to jump in so I started

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.160 
hesitant to jump in so I started
sketching<00:00:31.230> them<00:00:31.619> once<00:00:32.189> I<00:00:32.309> had<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:33.180> sketch<00:00:33.809> I

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
sketching them once I had the sketch I

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.660 
sketching them once I had the sketch I
thought<00:00:34.500> it'd<00:00:34.590> be<00:00:34.620> funnier<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.219> change<00:00:35.430> it<00:00:35.550> to

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
thought it'd be funnier to change it to

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.630 
thought it'd be funnier to change it to
an<00:00:35.760> animal<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:36.890> define<00:00:37.890> an<00:00:38.190> animal<00:00:38.610> that

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
an animal and I define an animal that

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.780 
an animal and I define an animal that
that<00:00:39.440> in<00:00:40.440> order<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.829> be<00:00:40.860> become<00:00:41.399> part<00:00:41.670> of<00:00:41.730> the

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
that in order to be become part of the

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.459 
that in order to be become part of the
community<00:00:42.000> I<00:00:42.390> guess<00:00:42.600> had<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:43.020> learn<00:00:43.170> how<00:00:43.230> to

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
community I guess had to learn how to

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.260 
community I guess had to learn how to
swim<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:44.660> and<00:00:45.660> you<00:00:46.200> know<00:00:46.910> penguin<00:00:47.910> seemed<00:00:48.180> to

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.540 
swim and and you know penguin seemed to
be<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:49.200> funniest<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.800> most<00:00:49.829> logical

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
be the the funniest and most logical

answer to that so once I had the

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.200 
answer to that so once I had the
character<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:55.079> had<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.890> think<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:56.910> know<00:00:57.030> I<00:00:57.090> had
