00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:26.070 
and each time a new one comes out they
just<00:05:24.820> add<00:05:25.120> a<00:05:25.150> different<00:05:25.360> model<00:05:25.630> kit<00:05:25.930> to<00:05:26.050> the

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
just add a different model kit to the

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.040 
just add a different model kit to the
group<00:05:26.380> so<00:05:27.370> eventually<00:05:28.360> when<00:05:28.660> all<00:05:28.780> five<00:05:29.020> of

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
group so eventually when all five of

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.900 
group so eventually when all five of
them<00:05:29.350> are<00:05:29.680> out<00:05:29.860> they<00:05:30.100> will<00:05:30.160> probably<00:05:30.370> all<00:05:30.669> five

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:30.910 
them are out they will probably all five

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.000 
them are out they will probably all five
of<00:05:31.030> them<00:05:31.240> in<00:05:31.330> these<00:05:31.450> same<00:05:31.690> poses<00:05:32.140> but<00:05:32.380> they'll

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.010 
of them in these same poses but they'll

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.379 
of them in these same poses but they'll
all<00:05:33.130> be<00:05:33.310> on<00:05:33.430> action<00:05:33.790> bases

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:35.389 
all be on action bases

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:38.210 
all be on action bases
then<00:05:36.389> what<00:05:36.660> continuing<00:05:37.560> on<00:05:37.919> with

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
then what continuing on with

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.810 
then what continuing on with
instructions<00:05:39.470> and<00:05:40.470> then<00:05:40.860> at<00:05:41.010> the<00:05:41.100> end<00:05:41.130> we<00:05:41.669> get

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 
instructions and then at the end we get

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.170 
instructions and then at the end we get
a<00:05:41.880> diagram<00:05:42.630> for<00:05:42.870> the<00:05:42.930> decals<00:05:43.669> and<00:05:44.669> a<00:05:44.910> color

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
a diagram for the decals and a color

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.590 
a diagram for the decals and a color
guide<00:05:45.480> right<00:05:46.380> here<00:05:46.850> some<00:05:47.850> before-and-after

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 
guide right here some before-and-after

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.350 
guide right here some before-and-after
shots<00:05:48.810> for<00:05:49.200> painting<00:05:49.919> panel<00:05:50.370> awning<00:05:50.669> and<00:05:51.240> the

shots for painting panel awning and the

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.790 
shots for painting panel awning and the
color<00:05:51.570> guard<00:05:51.810> for<00:05:51.990> wolf<00:05:52.200> a<00:05:53.690> so<00:05:54.690> uh<00:05:54.720> I<00:05:55.350> think

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
color guard for wolf a so uh I think

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.980 
color guard for wolf a so uh I think
this<00:05:55.919> is<00:05:56.010> going<00:05:56.130> to<00:05:56.190> be<00:05:56.340> a<00:05:56.639> little<00:05:57.330> bit<00:05:57.540> simpler

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:57.990 
this is going to be a little bit simpler

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:00.620 
this is going to be a little bit simpler
kit<00:05:58.260> than<00:05:58.470> deathscythe<00:05:58.860> he'll<00:05:59.630> probably

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.630 
kit than deathscythe he'll probably

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.580 
kit than deathscythe he'll probably
along<00:06:00.960> the<00:06:01.139> lines<00:06:01.290> of<00:06:01.530> death<00:06:02.250> scythe<00:06:02.460> II<00:06:02.639> W<00:06:03.030> so
