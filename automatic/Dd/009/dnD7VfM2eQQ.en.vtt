00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.740
 very good people here you have a video on 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.690
 the one that we're going to learn how to escape from 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.240
 the astronauts extract vouchers after 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.310
 see the georg video that I was waiting for 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.650
 that all you knew is already valid and 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.470
 it turns out that 80 or 90 percent 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.180
 who saw the video they did not know it because I've 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.760
 been thinking has made me think that a 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.890
 the best in many things that I know and that 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.930
 I assume that you know and not the 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.910
 I say so because this is one of them 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.180
 valuable to escape from the other as you can 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.800
 see if it catches you if you turn around quickly and 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.780
 sprint is a little bit and right now 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.870
 prostitues in iron you will let us go away 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.030
 the drink bothers us for nothing 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.760
 As you can see it is very easy to do not 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.649
 you do not need much and 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.750
 when they are low rounds for example if 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.670
 as you can see if you have show 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.649
 shalit and so fired two bullets worth 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.629
 when it is minus five or less of 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.920
 seven o'clock if it hooks you up and it's not 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:07.040
 time rotates all that is two bullets d 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.170
 of mustang and will release you good here os 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.090
 I put it since I was so that you see 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.470
 that they do not do anything is worth what is the 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.509
 Special weapon is the only special weapon 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.880
 that is the only weapon that does not make 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:20.330
 damage is worth the special weapon of munt the 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.369
 the popcorn are the popcorn and 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.930
 although we combine it is not worth it now 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.250
 with wine also for you to see with the 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.720
 Carry has a lot of chargers 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.820
 although the best is a little the pomegranate 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.289
 made is the only one that does not do it 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.479
 rest of the weapons because they are killing it 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:34.610
 they weaken little by little and all that and 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:37.490
 the the black hole 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.409
 makes run worth where they are low 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.140
 it does not affect him but better from a few 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.119
 10 or so if the hole absorbs it 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.970
 black then you come running that we 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.310
 I will show it 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.010
 well here you have the piece in which 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.810
 the bastard comes running out there I have a 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.370
 failure spear with hole area 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.170
 I wanted to piss I wanted to do it 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.530
 run and chance I did it and at 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.270
 hack that post since it got away 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:04.060
 so nothing there I have it there is 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.860
 when he starts to run but as he had 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.530
 a zombie not that he did not want to teach or he 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.230
 I had to be careful because if you see 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.270
 to fast camera because the zombie is 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.190
 giving for ass and I did not want to let me 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.810
 take with the zombie because if it gives you a 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.780
 hit if it hits you, it cuts you 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.970
 sprint okay so I did not want to do it 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.650
 so you can see even run though 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.390
 run the astronaut what can you do 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.520
 equal you go to your ball if there is no 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.840
 zombies at that time there will be no 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:31.560
 problems if you have two my close 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.870
 they can count quite 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.819
 and also a way that when you 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.910
 hitch you see him doing nothing 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.709
 neither run anything and also a 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.440
 so if you have a doctor 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.569
 it does not matter if you are round five or 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.880
 seven of the 14 until the 20 until the 20 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.620
 there you can burst 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.650
 Well, look there, catch me, slashing 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.420
 ions and I can escape and I blow them 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.930
 It's worth it if I caught you and you have a doctor 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.130
 crappy then the resales that is that is 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.800
 it's easy lifting and a couple of 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.600
 loaders or whatever it takes and wanted 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.910
 take advantage since I was to show you 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.380
 how to buy the bobo knife and for not 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.690
 make another video is precisely this 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:12.420
 Well, you can take advantage of it here 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.440
 buy the bowie knife very easy voucher 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.120
 because you know that he is in a place that 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.319
 it's hard to get good if you 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.260
 you fix there there is still gravity 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.849
 I mean there's still no artificial gravity 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.470
 it comes out because we have not activated the light 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:24.660
 then before activating the light we 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.880
 we come here and if there had been a couple 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.200
 of steps and jump you will have the 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.090
 enough height to buy 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.910
 buy back is the first the second 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.769
 It will be very very easy if you notice no 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.620
 there is nothing serious and that is to climb a 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.720
 little bit to be high and jump and 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.160
 let's get there there is always even without 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.280
 climb the steps also get there is 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.870
 pretty easy, it's worth as you can see there 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.030
 then he activated the gravity so you can see 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.850
 how difficult it is once it is activated 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.799
 add again I put the speed 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.600
 quick so you can see that the only 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:57.200
 difference is good there hooks me and what 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:59.609
 I bust with him with the two shots of 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.250
 mustang is worth you follow 3 you will die there 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:04.049
 go with a lot of eye you just have to give two and 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.970
 there you can see that there is seriousness 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:08.400
 the artificial grandstand will be activated 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:11.970
 then the jumps are not so high nor 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.500
 or fleets then you will have it younger 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.420
 you can buy the same, but it's more 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.280
 fucked i always recommend buying it 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.299
 before from there it's going to be impossible 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.919
 as the show from there is going to be 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.329
 impossible and from there you have to put 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:26.100
 the camera so high as you can see 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:27.300
 there and notice how this is what happens 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.880
 Now I do not go out to buy but 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.200
 come on, that's how nothing else would be named 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.110
 people I think that there is enough 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.880
 Of course the truth is that what I said as I saw 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.510
 that the georges did not know almost anything 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.880
 good 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.310
 I decided to put them on this too so that 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.290
 you see an easy way to 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.090
 to escape the astronaut to buy the 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.560
 bobo and all that so nothing kids 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.420
 I imagine that you will all be giving him cane 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.190
 to move on the dead who just got out I 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.170
 let's see if he's this weekend 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.030
 something and for next week you have 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:56.370
 some high round or something I'm not going to 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.320
 burst the map in plan cent and peak 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.210
 but good we will try the best one 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.300
 cooperative record or something like that 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:06.099
 so nothing more people 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.099
 greetings hope you like ciao
