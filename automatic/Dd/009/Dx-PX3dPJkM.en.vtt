00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:05.000
 I am the relationship and I am happy to have been given several times on the internet 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:07.999
 Force Foods Technique IAT to declare dead 

00:00:07.999 --> 00:00:11.940
 I want Sell and FDP on drums and have been using NATO technology for a long time 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.029
 a year 

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:16.689
 and before it starts to deal with all first world economy technology 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:22.599
 Basically, there is no precise definition of how to capitalize on his bed 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:23.519
 plays 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.159
 Nevertheless, there are four very common foot techniques 

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:28.519
 enforced 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:30.519
 there is the technique 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:33.519
 Here, the fair is played as above 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.040
 Thumbs as the name implies, the verses below are played here 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.400
 When we have a lot of technology you literally slip over in right-left motion 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.820
 Salvador pbe 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.290
 and finally those with drugs GA 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.410
 for this technique i also think it's good to play 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.800
 This also has the advantage that you will not hit the bottom plate too fast if 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.740
 but you certainly 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.100
 can already get the problem today to play the technique 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.270
 and the second advantage is quite clear, you get more dynamic 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.050
 Control over your opponent 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.760
 and how does the time work? 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.530
 here too there are four different versions 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.049
 I prefer hacking both ways, but I use this 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.940
 a few times a shortcoming brewing holding does not matter with beautiful light sun 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.790
 rotten lay 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.900
 I first play the pedal with the hoe 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.180
 you use the pedal a second time with the ball to play with the ball 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.180
 Pull rebounding noose 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.040
 m 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.580
 politically no longer realize the Prinzipalmarkt gave more time 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.450
 Also here are common Solingens with so-called top level 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.450
 Domains played 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.399
 the same will be sticking out then come to the world 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.700
 and we first both feet together before combining both feet 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.810
 at 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.820
 He once considered the foot movement Hola Pedals 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.119
 You will notice that the foot makes a kind of rolling movement 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:13.489
 if you do that then it's best to post 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.489
 right right left right right Muslims 

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:19.999
 Gelsenkirchen a few exercises and a few right-left combination 

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:24.789
 Play this exercise slowly at first, and cast the following link faster 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.529
 they start slightly to the right on the left 

00:02:29.529 --> 00:02:32.969
 left left right 

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:35.969
 at 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.969
 Next, Eintracht wants her characters to be on the right side on the right 

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:16.689
 left left right right 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:19.689
 Well 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:42.420
 however, another exercise in combination 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.420
 the Foreign Office 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.729
 should it go back the fast arrival 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:27.580
 I'll tell you something 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:28.979
 that was a lot of fun listening
