00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:15.580 
starting out with the dimensions they do

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.160 
starting out with the dimensions they do
give<00:00:15.820> you<00:00:15.910> straight<00:00:16.150> sidewalls<00:00:16.660> with<00:00:16.840> rounded

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.170 
give you straight sidewalls with rounded

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.570 
give you straight sidewalls with rounded
corners<00:00:17.470> so<00:00:17.980> it's<00:00:18.070> going<00:00:18.160> to<00:00:18.220> give<00:00:18.400> you<00:00:18.460> that

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:18.580 
corners so it's going to give you that

corners so it's going to give you that
traditional<00:00:19.120> feel<00:00:19.360> and<00:00:19.600> then<00:00:20.170> for<00:00:20.350> the

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:20.410 
traditional feel and then for the

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.740 
traditional feel and then for the
construction<00:00:21.040> this<00:00:21.730> is<00:00:21.790> a<00:00:22.000> true<00:00:22.270> one-piece

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:22.750 
construction this is a true one-piece

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:24.360 
construction this is a true one-piece
construction<00:00:22.930> and<00:00:23.620> they<00:00:23.890> wrapped<00:00:24.130> it<00:00:24.340> with

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:24.370 
construction and they wrapped it with

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.570 
construction and they wrapped it with
their<00:00:25.000> carbon<00:00:25.510> elite<00:00:25.930> carbon<00:00:26.350> fiber<00:00:26.590> so<00:00:27.369> this

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:27.580 
their carbon elite carbon fiber so this

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:28.380 
their carbon elite carbon fiber so this
is<00:00:27.640> going<00:00:27.760> to<00:00:27.820> give<00:00:27.940> you<00:00:28.030> that<00:00:28.150> great

they<00:00:33.280> did<00:00:33.520> do<00:00:33.700> their<00:00:33.850> diamond<00:00:34.360> print<00:00:34.690> so<00:00:34.989> it<00:00:35.020> is

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
they did do their diamond print so it is

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:36.660 
they did do their diamond print so it is
going<00:00:35.260> to<00:00:35.350> give<00:00:35.500> you<00:00:35.560> that<00:00:35.680> good<00:00:35.920> feel<00:00:36.280> through

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.910 
the glove to the shaft and then moving
down<00:00:39.790> here<00:00:39.820> moving<00:00:40.750> into<00:00:41.050> the<00:00:41.170> dagger<00:00:41.560> taper

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
down here moving into the dagger taper

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.550 
down here moving into the dagger taper
and<00:00:42.460> this<00:00:42.700> is<00:00:42.820> what<00:00:43.030> warrior<00:00:43.300> does<00:00:43.600> on<00:00:43.899> all<00:00:44.260> of

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
this line so you'll see it thin out

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.510 
this line so you'll see it thin out
towards<00:00:46.660> the<00:00:46.780> end<00:00:46.960> here<00:00:47.260> so<00:00:48.040> that's<00:00:48.280> going<00:00:48.430> to

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:48.520

then that's also going to allow the
bottom<00:00:52.180> portion<00:00:52.360> and<00:00:52.809> the<00:00:53.680> top<00:00:53.860> portion<00:00:54.160> to

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:54.520 
bottom portion and the top portion to

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.970 
bottom portion and the top portion to
really<00:00:54.760> bow<00:00:55.000> out<00:00:55.210> giving<00:00:55.809> you<00:00:55.960> that<00:00:56.350> extremely

00:00:58.799 --> 00:00:58.809 
quick release so now I'm moving down

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:00.119 
quick release so now I'm moving down
into<00:00:59.170> the<00:00:59.260> blade<00:00:59.410> starting<00:00:59.860> out<00:00:59.950> with<00:01:00.010> the

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
into the blade starting out with the

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:01.920 
into the blade starting out with the
blade<00:01:00.340> court<00:01:00.640> they<00:01:01.120> gave<00:01:01.300> it<00:01:01.420> the<00:01:01.570> D<00:01:01.719> Lite

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 
blade court they gave it the D Lite

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.869 
blade court they gave it the D Lite
blade<00:01:02.170> core<00:01:02.410> it<00:01:02.920> is<00:01:02.980> an<00:01:03.219> evolution<00:01:03.670> of<00:01:03.820> the

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:03.879 
blade core it is an evolution of the

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:05.789 
blade core it is an evolution of the
double<00:01:04.390> D<00:01:04.509> blade<00:01:04.780> that<00:01:04.960> you<00:01:05.049> guys<00:01:05.199> did<00:01:05.409> see<00:01:05.619> in

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:05.799 
double D blade that you guys did see in

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:07.770 
double D blade that you guys did see in
the<00:01:06.130> Dolomites<00:01:06.609> series<00:01:07.030> so<00:01:07.450> you're<00:01:07.539> gonna<00:01:07.630> get

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
the Dolomites series so you're gonna get

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.270 
the Dolomites series so you're gonna get
a<00:01:07.840> good<00:01:08.020> lightweight<00:01:08.380> responsive<00:01:08.920> feel<00:01:09.100> out

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
a good lightweight responsive feel out

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.249 
a good lightweight responsive feel out
of<00:01:09.310> it<00:01:09.520> and<00:01:09.700> then<00:01:10.179> for<00:01:10.359> the<00:01:10.450> foams<00:01:10.719> they<00:01:11.139> gave

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
of it and then for the foams they gave

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:12.779 
of it and then for the foams they gave
you<00:01:11.380> denser<00:01:11.709> foams<00:01:11.920> in<00:01:12.069> the<00:01:12.100> heel<00:01:12.340> area<00:01:12.490> to

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:12.789 
you denser foams in the heel area to

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:14.910 
you denser foams in the heel area to
give<00:01:12.909> you<00:01:12.999> that<00:01:13.119> stable<00:01:13.569> feel<00:01:13.840> and<00:01:14.109> then<00:01:14.590> as

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
give you that stable feel and then as

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.949 
give you that stable feel and then as
you<00:01:15.130> get<00:01:15.219> further<00:01:15.459> into<00:01:15.850> the<00:01:16.270> blade<00:01:16.630> in<00:01:16.899> the

00:01:16.949 --> 00:01:16.959 
you get further into the blade in the

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:18.870 
you get further into the blade in the
middle<00:01:17.350> and<00:01:17.529> in<00:01:17.649> the<00:01:17.770> toe<00:01:17.979> they<00:01:18.670> give<00:01:18.789> you

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
middle and in the toe they give you

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.209 
middle and in the toe they give you
softer<00:01:19.270> foams<00:01:19.509> to<00:01:19.810> act<00:01:20.139> more<00:01:20.469> springing<00:01:21.039> off

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:21.219 
softer foams to act more springing off

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:23.669 
softer foams to act more springing off
your<00:01:21.459> releases<00:01:21.759> and<00:01:22.179> then<00:01:22.719> they<00:01:22.869> also<00:01:23.020> did<00:01:23.350> do

00:01:23.669 --> 00:01:23.679 
your releases and then they also did do

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:25.590 
your releases and then they also did do
a<00:01:23.709> Eunice<00:01:24.219> bar<00:01:24.459> carbon<00:01:24.880> fiber<00:01:25.060> stringer

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
a Eunice bar carbon fiber stringer

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.199 
a Eunice bar carbon fiber stringer
running<00:01:26.139> all<00:01:26.319> the<00:01:26.469> way<00:01:26.590> through<00:01:26.950> to<00:01:27.549> add<00:01:27.729> that

00:01:28.199 --> 00:01:28.209 
running all the way through to add that

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:31.199 
running all the way through to add that
to<00:01:28.869> add<00:01:29.020> to<00:01:29.229> the<00:01:29.350> core<00:01:29.560> strength<00:01:29.920> and<00:01:30.159> add<00:01:30.939> to

00:01:31.199 --> 00:01:31.209 
to add to the core strength and add to

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:33.209 
to add to the core strength and add to
the<00:01:31.359> bench<00:01:31.749> strength<00:01:32.139> so<00:01:32.409> you<00:01:32.679> won't<00:01:32.859> get<00:01:33.099> the

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:33.219 
the bench strength so you won't get the

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:35.429 
the bench strength so you won't get the
blade<00:01:33.399> torquing<00:01:33.939> as<00:01:34.149> much<00:01:34.509> giving<00:01:35.109> you<00:01:35.200> a<00:01:35.259> more

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:35.439 
blade torquing as much giving you a more

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:37.649 
blade torquing as much giving you a more
accurate<00:01:35.649> shot<00:01:35.889> and<00:01:36.429> then<00:01:36.849> they<00:01:36.969> also<00:01:37.149> wrapped

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
accurate shot and then they also wrapped
