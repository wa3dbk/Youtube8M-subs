00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello have you ever asked 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.539
 how can you control the power of 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.580
 any kind of sound that comes through 

00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:10.709
 the speaker of your phone with 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.230
 android well then in this video we are going to 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:14.910
 see an application that allows us that 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.519
 allows us to control allows us 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.830
 increase the power of any type 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:21.929
 of sound whether it's music that comes out or 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.240
 by the rear speaker or by the 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:27.630
 headphones good then this application 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.339
 it's called volume more will you be able to 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.500
 download it from the link you have 

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:33.630
 down here in the description and the only 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.790
 sticks in quotes is that it costs a 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.320
 euro is a payment application I 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.270
 I personally recommend that you 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.010
 buy not only for the fact of supporting 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.990
 to the developer and all this that 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.370
 normally they say it, but because 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.920
 it really is an application that I 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.500
 I usually use and that is pretty 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.570
 useful the only glitch in quotation marks is that 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.010
 it is not compatible at the moment it is not 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:58.740
 available on android 4.1 and 4.2 ie 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.170
 it would only work for Android 2.3 and 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.180
 for android 4.0 which is right now the 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.589
 rom that I have but well let's 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.689
 open the application and let's explain 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.350
 a little how it works here as you can 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.299
 see the interface 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.670
 quite simple and on the part of 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.680
 up we have three options the settings 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.920
 of the main speaker let's say it would be 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.930
 the rear the helmets adjustments 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.090
 that we connect and the settings of 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.369
 bluetooth that would be then in case 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.190
 we have some bluetooth device to 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.200
 being which we're transferring a 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.220
 sound because we could control it from 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.320
 this option 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.850
 well down here we have more things 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.250
 interesting as for example the 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.039
 root tools that good is not something 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.259
 mandatory to use it would be options 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:41.880
 more advanced and that require 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.940
 superuser permissions but what is 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.069
 the application in particular works very 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.860
 well without having to rock so 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:51.929
 a point in your favor good we are going to 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.990
 start with the first option that is the 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:56.490
 to control the main speaker we're going 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.520
 to activate first of all and here 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.149
 well we have several things to see what 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.850
 First 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.890
 we could control it from a 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.140
 a small simple panel like who says 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.470
 we have several numbers here as you see 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.500
 until the 20th and well this is basically 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.230
 to be able to increase as levels the 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.640
 volume of our speaker yo 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.730
 I usually recommend that you leave it 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.730
 for the samsung galaxy eyes between 2 and 3 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.590
 because because we can increase and we can 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.150
 do tests but you can get a 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.420
 moment in which as you see here 10 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:32.160
 maximum for the most phones 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.620
 speakers reaches a point where it 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.780
 damage and eye me this is what I mention this 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.830
 in principle I am showing you this 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.160
 application but I'm not responsible 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.930
 much less that you test and 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.910
 you see that suddenly the speaker stops 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.319
 work this is an application that is 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.840
 very useful but you have to use it with 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:51.930
 careful so I recommend that what 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.060
 leave between two and four as much 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.459
 because for the galaxy eyes it is not 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.780
 have a very resistant speaker and I 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.610
 I think you can tell the difference 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.260
 personally I have tried it and yes it is 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.110
 good note some other options 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.630
 interesting the bass boost that also 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.250
 is an option that personally in the 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.300
 galaxy eyes does not work as you see 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.540
 here 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:16.050
 down here may not work in some 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.060
 devices and the delay fact I do not know how 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.980
 pronounced in English but that also 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.830
 allows us to control the sound 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.140
 stereo that personally in the galaxy 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.720
 I have not tried this option and it's good 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.050
 for the most advanced users let's say 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.340
 that we have an equalizer 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.620
 customizable from here we can 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.690
 control frequencies for 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.570
 people who understand a little here as 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:43.890
 and we see the hertz is changing by 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:47.670
 here this small number and good the 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.590
 truth is that it is an application that if 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.570
 you know how to handle the subject of 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.690
 sequencers works pretty well 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.670
 well let's keep seeing here 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.070
 down that says press menu for more 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.950
 options here is another interesting thing and 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:04.470
 is that if we want we can create 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.750
 different profiles and save them here 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.270
 how do you see save load or delete the 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.560
 different profiles good in the rest of 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:14.070
 options is basically the same 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.870
 we could control the volume of 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.239
 headphones or the volume of 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.470
 bluetooth speakers so the truth is 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.750
 that this is an application that I have 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.760
 trying and I really like the 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:27.060
 truth is that you can notice a lot 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:30.360
 the power that increases and the truth is 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.070
 which is useful for a lot of phones 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.530
 like for example the samsung galaxy nexus 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.820
 that do not have a speaker excessively 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.560
 powerful but thanks to this 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.260
 application and without having 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:42.090
 superuser permissions as we can 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.180
 control it and we can increase the 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.650
 speed and power so good 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.090
 that's been all in this video I hope 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.950
 that you liked it if it's like that 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.570
 forget to hit like if you want to see 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:55.070
 more videos subscribe here in the part 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.070
 from below and see you a greeting
