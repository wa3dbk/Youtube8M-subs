the back but don't worry about that for
now<00:00:43.829> because<00:00:44.070> we'll<00:00:44.340> just<00:00:44.550> bobby<00:00:44.730> pin<00:00:45.000> out

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090

later<00:00:46.820> now<00:00:47.820> taking<00:00:48.180> both<00:00:48.360> those<00:00:48.629> sections<00:00:49.110> I'm

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
later now taking both those sections I'm

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.889 
later now taking both those sections I'm
going<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.129> interlock<00:00:50.640> them<00:00:50.789> together<00:00:51.210> so<00:00:51.719> this

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
going to interlock them together so this

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.299 
going to interlock them together so this
means<00:00:52.079> insert<00:00:52.440> twisting<00:00:52.770> eight<00:00:52.920> words<00:00:53.100> and

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
means insert twisting eight words and

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.090 
means insert twisting eight words and
going<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.820> be<00:00:53.910> twisting<00:00:54.239> in<00:00:54.390> words<00:00:54.660> instead<00:00:55.100> so

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
going to be twisting in words instead so

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.330 
going to be twisting in words instead so
the<00:00:56.460> key<00:00:56.640> is<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:57.180> twist<00:00:57.780> nice<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.530> tight<00:00:59.039> and

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
the key is to twist nice and tight and

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.060 
the key is to twist nice and tight and
as<00:01:00.000> much<00:01:00.239> as<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.539> can<00:01:00.780> really<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.379> I'm<00:01:01.920> going

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
to talk about two-thirds wait I'm so

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.710 
to talk about two-thirds wait I'm so
then<00:01:05.189> I'm<00:01:05.400> going<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.700> split<00:01:06.060> these<00:01:06.330> two

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
then I'm going to split these two

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.289 
then I'm going to split these two
sections<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.260> hair<00:01:07.290> into<00:01:07.740> three<00:01:08.159> sections<00:01:08.880> my

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
sections of hair into three sections my

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.230 
sections of hair into three sections my
and<00:01:09.600> i'm<00:01:10.020> just<00:01:10.140> going<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.470> break<00:01:10.740> deny<00:01:11.159> so<00:01:11.790> this

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
and i'm just going to break deny so this

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.539 
and i'm just going to break deny so this
should<00:01:12.570> make<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.290> hair<00:01:13.530> some<00:01:13.740> more<00:01:13.979> unique<00:01:14.400> it

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
should make the hair some more unique it

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.210 
should make the hair some more unique it
is<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:15.090> twist<00:01:15.570> rope<00:01:15.780> but<00:01:16.350> as<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.860> reaches
