00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
especially early in the spring because

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.260 
especially early in the spring because
the<00:01:27.450> warm<00:01:28.409> air<00:01:28.650> blows<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.369> ice<00:01:29.490> back<00:01:29.850> up<00:01:30.090> into

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
the warm air blows the ice back up into

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.740 
the warm air blows the ice back up into
the<00:01:30.360> cooler<00:01:31.100> atmosphere<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.509> it<00:01:33.509> kind<00:01:33.720> of

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
the cooler atmosphere and it kind of

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.649 
the cooler atmosphere and it kind of
just<00:01:33.930> coats<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.560> rain<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:35.970> starts<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.540> get

bigger<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.350> bigger<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.619> bigger<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.040> bigger

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189

and finally it's too heavy for the win

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.660 
and finally it's too heavy for the win
the<00:01:39.930> hold<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.380> becomes<00:01:40.680> hail<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:41.490> there's

it'll dilute the sample and it won't be
able<00:04:25.729> to<00:04:25.880> actually<00:04:26.030> test

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930

tape<00:05:32.360> on<00:05:32.599> it<00:05:32.630> and<00:05:32.960> then<00:05:33.080> you<00:05:33.229> have<00:05:33.409> to<00:05:33.500> put<00:05:33.650> it

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 
tape on it and then you have to put it

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:35.950 
tape on it and then you have to put it
in<00:05:33.770> the<00:05:33.830> bag<00:05:34.039> and<00:05:34.220> seal<00:05:34.490> it<00:05:34.520> I<00:05:34.849> guess<00:05:35.750> that's

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
in the bag and seal it I guess that's

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.409 
in the bag and seal it I guess that's
the<00:05:36.050> show<00:05:36.710> that<00:05:36.979> it<00:05:37.099> she<00:05:37.639> didn't<00:05:37.909> tamper<00:05:38.150> with

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:38.419 
the show that it she didn't tamper with

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:39.939 
the show that it she didn't tamper with
the<00:05:38.479> results<00:05:38.960> that<00:05:39.080> way<00:05:39.199> you<00:05:39.260> can't<00:05:39.530> blame<00:05:39.770> her

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:39.949 
the results that way you can't blame her

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:42.460 
the results that way you can't blame her
later<00:05:40.250> when<00:05:40.490> something<00:05:40.820> goes<00:05:40.909> wrong<00:05:41.210> which<00:05:42.080> I

this big briefcase exchange kind of

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:02.529 
this big briefcase exchange kind of
thing<00:06:01.159> except<00:06:01.490> it<00:06:01.610> was<00:06:01.729> with<00:06:01.909> a<00:06:01.940> urine<00:06:02.360> sample

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:02.539 
thing except it was with a urine sample

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:05.260 
thing except it was with a urine sample
as<00:06:03.530> gross<00:06:03.830> as<00:06:03.860> that<00:06:04.039> may<00:06:04.310> sound<00:06:04.550> but<00:06:05.000> the<00:06:05.090> funny

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270 
as gross as that may sound but the funny

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.080 
as gross as that may sound but the funny
thing<00:06:05.360> about<00:06:05.509> the<00:06:05.930> whole<00:06:06.080> thing<00:06:06.110> is<00:06:06.470> is<00:06:06.680> like

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.090 
thing about the whole thing is is like

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:09.580 
thing about the whole thing is is like
they<00:06:08.090> the<00:06:08.479> bathroom<00:06:08.900> I<00:06:08.930> had<00:06:09.050> to<00:06:09.110> do<00:06:09.229> the<00:06:09.349> test

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:09.590 
they the bathroom I had to do the test

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:12.760 
they the bathroom I had to do the test
and<00:06:09.770> had<00:06:10.460> no<00:06:10.610> running<00:06:10.940> water<00:06:11.030> in<00:06:11.389> there<00:06:11.770> that's

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:12.770 
and had no running water in there that's

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:14.110 
and had no running water in there that's
because<00:06:13.070> they<00:06:13.190> don't<00:06:13.220> want<00:06:13.610> you<00:06:13.759> to<00:06:13.909> I<00:06:13.940> guess

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.120 
because they don't want you to I guess

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.939 
because they don't want you to I guess
put<00:06:14.509> water<00:06:14.750> in<00:06:14.960> your<00:06:15.050> solution<00:06:15.590> and<00:06:15.740> kind<00:06:15.889> of

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:15.949 
put water in your solution and kind of

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:18.279 
put water in your solution and kind of
dilute<00:06:16.220> it<00:06:16.340> and<00:06:16.550> the<00:06:17.150> toilet<00:06:17.539> in<00:06:17.630> there<00:06:17.840> had

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:18.289 
dilute it and the toilet in there had

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:19.990 
dilute it and the toilet in there had
like<00:06:18.590> it<00:06:18.740> was<00:06:18.860> filled<00:06:19.099> up<00:06:19.220> to<00:06:19.400> like<00:06:19.610> the<00:06:19.759> brim

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:20.000 
like it was filled up to like the brim

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.999 
like it was filled up to like the brim
and<00:06:20.300> it<00:06:20.449> had<00:06:20.599> blue<00:06:20.870> solution<00:06:21.259> in<00:06:21.560> it<00:06:21.680> so<00:06:21.889> the

00:06:21.999 --> 00:06:22.009 
and it had blue solution in it so the

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:23.770 
and it had blue solution in it so the
toilet<00:06:22.310> didn't<00:06:22.490> flush<00:06:22.699> either<00:06:22.940> so<00:06:23.630> I<00:06:23.659> think

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:23.780 
toilet didn't flush either so I think

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.240 
toilet didn't flush either so I think
the<00:06:23.990> reason<00:06:24.169> the<00:06:24.409> reason<00:06:24.530> why<00:06:24.770> they<00:06:25.039> had<00:06:25.159> the

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:25.250 
the reason the reason why they had the

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:26.649 
the reason the reason why they had the
blue<00:06:25.400> solution<00:06:25.699> is<00:06:25.970> so<00:06:26.090> you<00:06:26.150> didn't<00:06:26.449> try<00:06:26.599> to

00:06:26.649 --> 00:06:26.659 
blue solution is so you didn't try to

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:28.600 
blue solution is so you didn't try to
like<00:06:26.960> dip<00:06:27.409> into<00:06:27.560> the<00:06:27.770> toilet<00:06:27.949> and<00:06:28.250> put<00:06:28.430> some

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:28.610 
like dip into the toilet and put some

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:29.920 
like dip into the toilet and put some
water<00:06:28.789> in<00:06:28.940> it<00:06:29.090> which<00:06:29.270> I<00:06:29.389> thought<00:06:29.509> was<00:06:29.659> kind<00:06:29.810> of

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:29.930 
water in it which I thought was kind of

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.990 
water in it which I thought was kind of
funny<00:06:30.139> so<00:06:30.470> I<00:06:30.770> mean<00:06:31.220> obviously<00:06:31.370> if<00:06:31.729> you<00:06:31.789> put

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.000 
funny so I mean obviously if you put

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.129 
funny so I mean obviously if you put
that<00:06:32.150> new<00:06:32.360> year<00:06:32.479> thing<00:06:32.690> it<00:06:32.870> would<00:06:32.960> turn

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:33.139 
that new year thing it would turn

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:35.110 
that new year thing it would turn
everything<00:06:33.500> blue<00:06:33.889> or<00:06:34.220> green<00:06:34.490> I<00:06:34.550> guess<00:06:34.880> yellow

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 
everything blue or green I guess yellow

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.600 
everything blue or green I guess yellow
+<00:06:35.389> blue<00:06:35.419> equals<00:06:36.050> like<00:06:36.260> a<00:06:36.289> green<00:06:36.650> so<00:06:37.340> I<00:06:37.400> guess<00:06:37.490> I

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:37.610 
+ blue equals like a green so I guess I

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.350 
+ blue equals like a green so I guess I
would<00:06:37.760> turn<00:06:38.120> it<00:06:38.270> green<00:06:38.900> its<00:06:39.380> gross<00:06:39.740> is<00:06:39.919> this

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:40.360 
would turn it green its gross is this

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.330 
would turn it green its gross is this
commentary<00:06:41.360> might<00:06:41.540> be<00:06:41.750> but<00:06:42.590> luckily<00:06:43.010> I<00:06:43.190> was
