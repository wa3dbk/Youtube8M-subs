00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.869 
knocking out guys a lot with power and
as<00:00:59.049> I<00:00:59.199> began<00:00:59.470> to<00:00:59.530> fight<00:00:59.799> a<00:00:59.830> better<00:01:00.159> level<00:01:00.790> of

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
as I began to fight a better level of

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:03.450 
as I began to fight a better level of
fighters<00:01:01.470> recently<00:01:02.470> I<00:01:02.500> was<00:01:02.739> having<00:01:02.920> problems

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
fighters recently I was having problems

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.429 
fighters recently I was having problems
because<00:01:03.549> I<00:01:03.879> was<00:01:04.030> dependent<00:01:04.420> on<00:01:04.510> my<00:01:04.750> strength

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:05.439 
because I was dependent on my strength

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:08.820 
because I was dependent on my strength
and<00:01:05.619> power<00:01:05.799> and<00:01:06.100> so<00:01:06.790> what<00:01:07.330> he<00:01:07.870> did<00:01:08.320> was<00:01:08.590> to<00:01:08.710> go

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:08.830 
and power and so what he did was to go

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.920 
and power and so what he did was to go
back<00:01:08.860> to<00:01:09.700> doing<00:01:09.940> what<00:01:10.120> he<00:01:10.150> did<00:01:10.360> a<00:01:10.390> lot<00:01:10.630> in<00:01:10.810> his

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
back to doing what he did a lot in his

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.410 
back to doing what he did a lot in his
em'ly<00:01:11.110> days<00:01:11.380> being<00:01:11.710> a<00:01:11.800> boxer<00:01:12.040> and<00:01:12.460> that's<00:01:13.180> been

em'ly days being a boxer and that's been

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.480 
em'ly days being a boxer and that's been
the<00:01:13.510> biggest<00:01:13.690> difference<00:01:14.020> it's<00:01:14.590> not<00:01:14.980> so<00:01:15.250> much

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
the biggest difference it's not so much

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.780

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.210 
used to do in his amateur days and
that's<00:01:46.570> why<00:01:46.750> it's<00:01:46.930> so<00:01:47.050> easy<00:01:47.290> for<00:01:47.500> him<00:01:47.680> to<00:01:47.890> adapt

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
that's why it's so easy for him to adapt

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.710 
that's why it's so easy for him to adapt
to<00:01:48.250> the<00:01:48.550> methods<00:01:48.909> that<00:01:48.970> I'm<00:01:49.120> trying<00:01:49.390> to<00:01:49.510> teach

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
to the methods that I'm trying to teach

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.690 
to the methods that I'm trying to teach
him<00:01:49.900> because<00:01:50.500> it's<00:01:50.710> really<00:01:50.979> not<00:01:51.130> teaching<00:01:51.610> new

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
him because it's really not teaching new

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.360 
him because it's really not teaching new
things<00:01:51.970> that<00:01:52.120> just<00:01:52.300> reminded<00:01:52.840> him<00:01:53.050> and<00:01:53.370> what

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:54.370 
things that just reminded him and what

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.760 
things that just reminded him and what
he<00:01:54.460> does<00:01:54.700> after<00:01:55.450> the<00:01:55.570> gym<00:01:55.810> is<00:01:56.080> over

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
he does after the gym is over

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.219 
he does after the gym is over
Miguel<00:01:57.340> goes<00:01:57.610> home<00:01:57.909> and<00:01:58.090> practices<00:01:58.659> on<00:01:58.930> his

keeping his balance and jabbing and

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.570 
keeping his balance and jabbing and
that's<00:02:04.870> what<00:02:05.080> makes<00:02:05.290> my<00:02:05.470> job<00:02:05.740> easy<00:02:06.040> it's<00:02:06.310> not
