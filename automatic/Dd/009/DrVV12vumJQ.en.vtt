you around my slime chunk farm today as
you<00:00:18.510> can<00:00:18.779> see<00:00:19.050> my<00:00:19.650> slam<00:00:20.070> a<00:00:20.279> chunk<00:00:20.310> farm<00:00:20.730> is

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.260 
you can see my slam a chunk farm is

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.609 
you can see my slam a chunk farm is
decorated<00:00:22.260> as<00:00:22.350> a<00:00:22.680> slight<00:00:22.980> so<00:00:24.350> not<00:00:25.350> much<00:00:25.439> to

and a bit of a way to get down into the
slime<00:00:34.890> chunk<00:00:35.160> room<00:00:35.370> area<00:00:35.969> obviously<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.780> daggit

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
slime chunk room area obviously a daggit

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.970 
slime chunk room area obviously a daggit
dug<00:00:37.530> out<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.739> slime<00:00:38.399> area<00:00:38.790> first<00:00:39.680> so<00:00:40.680> I<00:00:40.710> could

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
dug out the slime area first so I could

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.869 
dug out the slime area first so I could
decide<00:00:42.170> where<00:00:43.170> it<00:00:43.320> was<00:00:43.440> going<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.649> go<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:44.760> way

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
decide where it was going to go the way

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.200 
decide where it was going to go the way
I<00:00:44.910> did<00:00:45.059> that<00:00:45.390> was<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:45.809> worked<00:00:46.289> out<00:00:46.440> where<00:00:46.590> my

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
I did that was I worked out where my

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.760 
I did that was I worked out where my
slime<00:00:48.210> chunk<00:00:48.660> area<00:00:48.989> was<00:00:49.170> going<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.410> be<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.710> it

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
slime chunk area was going to be and it

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.220 
slime chunk area was going to be and it
was<00:00:49.890> just<00:00:50.039> over<00:00:50.280> this<00:00:50.370> way<00:00:50.719> at<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.809> moment<00:00:51.870> now

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
was just over this way at the moment now

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
I've just got some see through blocks

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.939 
I've just got some see through blocks
you<00:00:53.760> can<00:00:53.910> see<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.390> slime<00:00:54.780> trunk<00:00:55.140> area<00:00:55.350> as<00:00:55.710> you

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
you can see the slime trunk area as you

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.860 
you can see the slime trunk area as you
can<00:00:56.070> see<00:00:56.250> there<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:56.520> already<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.910> slam<00:00:57.570> down

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
can see there is already a slam down

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.260 
can see there is already a slam down
there<00:00:58.190> but<00:00:59.190> I<00:00:59.219> made<00:00:59.370> sure<00:00:59.399> there<00:00:59.670> was<00:00:59.699> so<00:01:00.030> very

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
lava before I dug down on this one I

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.580 
lava before I dug down on this one I
made<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.339> lot<00:01:05.580> easier<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:06.299> honest<00:01:07.260> in<00:01:07.350> my<00:01:07.439> little

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
made a lot easier I honest in my little

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.469 
made a lot easier I honest in my little
room<00:01:07.799> there's<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.189> ladder<00:01:08.610> all<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.880> way<00:01:08.970> down

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
room there's a ladder all the way down

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.160 
room there's a ladder all the way down
but<00:01:10.229> if<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.470> want<00:01:10.680> quick<00:01:11.070> access<00:01:11.100> there<00:01:11.790> is<00:01:11.939> a

but if you want quick access there is a
a<00:01:13.170> jump<00:01:13.830> point<00:01:13.860> with<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:15.259> yeah<00:01:16.259> water<00:01:16.560> trapped

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
a jump point with a yeah water trapped

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.429 
a jump point with a yeah water trapped
down<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.670> bottom<00:01:17.909> just<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.270> fall<00:01:18.900> into<00:01:19.080> to

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
down the bottom just to fall into to

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.039 
down the bottom just to fall into to
soften<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.070> ball<00:01:20.490> which<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.540> will<00:01:21.689> take<00:01:21.840> right

now yeah what's the tale about this

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.039 
now yeah what's the tale about this
slime<00:01:27.330> farm<00:01:27.540> basically<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:29.780> well<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:30.810> used

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
slime farm basically it is well I used

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.530 
slime farm basically it is well I used
chunk<00:01:31.500> base<00:01:31.860> comm<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:33.000> work<00:01:33.270> out<00:01:33.420> the

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
chunk base comm to work out the

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.560 
chunk base comm to work out the
coordinates<00:01:33.869> for<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.380> farm<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:35.360> found<00:01:36.360> there

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
coordinates for the farm I found there

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.850 
coordinates for the farm I found there
it<00:01:36.659> was<00:01:36.780> nice<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.110> close<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.290> where<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:37.560> wanted

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
it was nice and close to where I wanted

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.960 
it was nice and close to where I wanted
to<00:01:37.920> go<00:01:38.040> this<00:01:38.850> one<00:01:39.060> is<00:01:39.170> two<00:01:40.170> chunks<00:01:40.590> wide<00:01:40.829> so<00:01:41.610> the

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
to go this one is two chunks wide so the

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.929 
to go this one is two chunks wide so the
chunks<00:01:42.360> are<00:01:42.479> typically<00:01:42.840> 6<00:01:43.140> x<00:01:43.259> 16<00:01:43.829> x<00:01:43.860> 16<00:01:44.100> this

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
chunks are typically 6 x 16 x 16 this

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.639 
chunks are typically 6 x 16 x 16 this
one<00:01:45.180> room<00:01:45.659> here<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:46.430> so<00:01:47.430> it's<00:01:47.579> 32<00:01:48.090> x<00:01:48.299> 16<00:01:48.960> play

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
one room here is so it's 32 x 16 play

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:55.630 
one room here is so it's 32 x 16 play
too<00:01:49.710> long<00:01:50.070> 16<00:01:50.610> wide<00:01:50.880> it's<00:01:51.270> uh<00:01:51.509> this<00:01:51.869> one<00:01:52.049> is<00:01:52.430> or
