when you're playing a four-way game that

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:15.400 
when you're playing a four-way game that
requires<00:07:13.910> the<00:07:14.270> joystick<00:07:14.660> to<00:07:14.690> go<00:07:14.900> up<00:07:15.140> down<00:07:15.350> left

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:24.430 

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:27.280 

that's<00:07:25.430> four-way<00:07:25.910> mode<00:07:26.150> and<00:07:26.420> this<00:07:26.930> is<00:07:27.110> going

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:27.290 
that's four-way mode and this is going

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:29.890 
that's four-way mode and this is going

back to eight-way mode and this enables

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:31.780 
back to eight-way mode and this enables
you<00:07:30.020> to<00:07:30.050> activate<00:07:30.560> two<00:07:30.830> switches<00:07:31.160> at<00:07:31.490> the<00:07:31.580> same

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:31.790 
you to activate two switches at the same

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:35.080 
you to activate two switches at the same
time<00:07:32.030> in<00:07:32.300> order<00:07:32.390> to<00:07:32.540> hit<00:07:32.660> the<00:07:32.810> corners<00:07:33.200> now<00:07:34.090> all

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:35.090 
time in order to hit the corners now all

time in order to hit the corners now all
four<00:07:35.360> joysticks<00:07:35.840> r.j<00:07:36.500> sticks<00:07:36.830> from<00:07:37.550> ulta

marcom<00:07:38.780> I<00:07:39.020> think<00:07:40.010> that's<00:07:40.220> the<00:07:40.430> best<00:07:40.670> option<00:07:41.060> in

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:41.450 
marcom I think that's the best option in

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:43.930 
marcom I think that's the best option in
this<00:07:41.990> case<00:07:42.230> if<00:07:42.500> you<00:07:42.590> want<00:07:42.620> to<00:07:42.830> have<00:07:43.010> the

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:43.940 
this case if you want to have the

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:45.760 
this case if you want to have the
ability<00:07:44.030> to<00:07:44.300> play<00:07:44.540> eight<00:07:44.750> Way<00:07:44.930> games<00:07:45.230> as<00:07:45.560> well

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:45.770 
ability to play eight Way games as well

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:49.240 

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.480 

with<00:07:50.050> this<00:07:50.229> you<00:07:50.470> do<00:07:50.590> not<00:07:50.710> need<00:07:50.979> a<00:07:51.009> dedicated

with this you do not need a dedicated
