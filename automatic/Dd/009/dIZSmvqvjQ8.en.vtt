get<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.780> little<00:01:37.080> bit<00:01:37.200> over<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.620> over<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.310> top

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
get a little bit over the over the top

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.660 
get a little bit over the over the top
with<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.230> liquid<00:01:40.230> but<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:40.980> can<00:01:41.130> see<00:01:41.340> how<00:01:41.520> it's

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
with the liquid but you can see how it's

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:48.800 
with the liquid but you can see how it's
going<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:41.970> little<00:01:42.210> bit<00:01:42.300> dry<00:01:42.570> in<00:01:42.840> places<00:01:47.660> you<00:01:48.660> can

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
going a little bit dry in places you can

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:59.340 
going a little bit dry in places you can
see<00:01:49.050> that<00:01:49.260> right<00:01:49.470> here

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.780 

so<00:02:00.350> if<00:02:00.410> I<00:02:00.560> left<00:02:00.830> that<00:02:01.040> for<00:02:01.280> a<00:02:01.310> while<00:02:01.430> that<00:02:01.640> would

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
so if I left that for a while that would

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.920 
so if I left that for a while that would
probably<00:02:02.000> be<00:02:03.340> kind<00:02:04.340> of<00:02:04.520> dry<00:02:04.880> like<00:02:05.360> if<00:02:05.540> I<00:02:05.660> left

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
probably be kind of dry like if I left

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:14.080 
probably be kind of dry like if I left
that<00:02:06.080> all<00:02:06.320> go<00:02:06.760> up<00:02:07.760> or<00:02:08.000> then<00:02:12.370> die<00:02:13.370> probably<00:02:13.640> be

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
that all go up or then die probably be

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.470 
that all go up or then die probably be
try<00:02:14.330> so<00:02:14.870> I<00:02:15.430> really<00:02:16.430> like<00:02:16.520> that<00:02:16.730> hold<00:02:16.970> absorbs<00:02:17.390> a

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
try so I really like that hold absorbs a

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.800 
try so I really like that hold absorbs a
left<00:02:18.700> again<00:02:19.700> it's<00:02:19.910> really<00:02:20.120> comfortable

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
left again it's really comfortable

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.930 
left again it's really comfortable
and<00:02:21.770> I<00:02:21.860> just<00:02:22.040> really<00:02:22.250> like<00:02:22.400> the<00:02:22.520> padding<00:02:22.820> down
