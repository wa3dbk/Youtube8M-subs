 song liv cereals vf I am of course a realist and 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:44.060

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.570
 fair question but you have to understand 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.300
 it takes time to do something well 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.090
 the old adage says hurry people 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.380
 make you laugh 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.630
 we do not position ourselves as 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.850
 the professional is all done on clean 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.770
 the enthusiasm for money for work we do not 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.200
 we get accordingly and never 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.030
 set deadlines not just conscience not 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.280

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.690
 do as best we can 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.710
 between the big releases we will 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.650
 try to do something small and 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.690
 interesting so for example we launched 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.300
 small series of battered wings 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.420

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:03.460
 separate kind of extreme sports 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:07.800
 actually this mini-series itself goes like 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.800
 preparing for a big movie in the future 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.010
 if you were not waiting for the viewer you probably 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.030
 already noticed that all our videos 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.790
 interconnected 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.240
 heroes from one show may appear in 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.760
 a friend 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:23.250

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:30.810
 video 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:33.150
 imagine the damage itself well for the first 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.280
 I think the diary is enough to 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.850
 The following issues were interesting for 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.800
