00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
as possible so for the succession like I

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.719 
as possible so for the succession like I
said<00:05:20.510> before<00:05:20.660> I<00:05:20.960> think<00:05:21.110> you<00:05:21.950> breathe<00:05:22.280> then<00:05:22.550> you

let's say you could hold your breath for
one<00:05:47.599> minute<00:05:47.930> but<00:05:48.500> when<00:05:48.680> you<00:05:48.800> keep<00:05:49.010> on<00:05:49.460> doing

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
breath for two minutes so this this was

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.180 
breath for two minutes so this this was
doubles<00:05:56.810> of<00:05:56.990> your<00:05:57.139> time<00:05:57.380> once<00:05:57.860> you<00:05:57.979> practice
