00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:04.450
 Hello, Iâ€™ll tell you all taxes 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:05.820
 to replace 

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.600
 indicator lamp 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.559
 him 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:12.559
 as stated in the statement 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:16.099
 to replace both of these bulbs any of 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:18.720
 they must be removed 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.060
 it fastens on 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.470
 two tapes 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.099
 on 6 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:27.099
 and body clips 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.570
 Moscow these holes in one 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.590
 the borrower 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.590
 rub one goal 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:46.700
 here 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.290
 Klitschko herself 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.780
 here have 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.200
 4 points 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.940
 and further 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.060
 where to go 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.429
 respectively 

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:02.420
 mostly flashlight 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.420
 such here 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.310
 there are two ways this discovery 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.700
 these two screws 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.420
 and then timofeev himself 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.870
 storm your thoughts out 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.630
 I think that there is a big risk of breaking 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.050
 wherein 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.300
 self-contribution to the strengthening of these birds 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.920
 because it is very tough 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.030
 pulling out 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.870
 and here from there pliers 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.679
 it was very hard to phone attention 

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:35.860
 so I do not advise 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.360
 I suggest 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.680
 disassemble 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.620
 inner lining and not much time 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.290
 occupies 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.380
 the main thing is to remove this error here and 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:45.870
 get to 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.550
 here these faces and watch 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.980
 here they are glowing with happiness 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.670
 where can I find them 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.100
 via 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.100
 a simple tool in the perth hammer 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.620
 and vodka services such 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.539
 eg 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:04.539
 in Ukraine 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.830
 this date may be no problem 

00:02:12.669 --> 00:02:14.959
 big ballet show under yes says 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.589
 small about and books 

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:20.699
 That is why Moscow was more so 

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:23.319
 turn signals with gorilla 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.189
 in dimensions horizontally 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:28.189
