already has some conditioner in it so

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.540 
already has some conditioner in it so
I'm<00:01:40.000> just<00:01:40.240> going<00:01:40.420> to<00:01:40.479> use<00:01:40.780> my<00:01:41.170> shea<00:01:41.830> butter<00:01:42.160> mix

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 
I'm just going to use my shea butter mix

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.859 
I'm just going to use my shea butter mix
and<00:01:44.250> if<00:01:45.250> I<00:01:45.400> wanted<00:01:45.610> to<00:01:45.850> really<00:01:46.150> really<00:01:46.390> hold<00:01:46.690> I

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
and if I wanted to really really hold I

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:48.990 
and if I wanted to really really hold I
would<00:01:47.020> probably<00:01:47.170> add<00:01:47.470> some<00:01:47.740> gel<00:01:47.950> too<00:01:48.220> but<00:01:48.520> that

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
would probably add some gel too but that

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.430 
would probably add some gel too but that
wasn't<00:01:49.180> necessary<00:01:49.660> because<00:01:49.840> the<00:01:49.930> conditioner

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
wasn't necessary because the conditioner

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.600 
wasn't necessary because the conditioner
was<00:01:50.590> going<00:01:50.740> to<00:01:50.830> hold<00:01:50.979> and<00:01:51.250> the<00:01:51.399> shea<00:01:51.580> butter

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
mix just going to hold to and of course
