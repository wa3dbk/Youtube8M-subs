making phone calls with the pantech link

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:53.670 
making phone calls with the pantech link
we<00:04:52.600> were<00:04:52.690> a<00:04:52.720> little<00:04:52.810> bit<00:04:52.990> disappointed<00:04:53.080> by<00:04:53.620> the

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
we were a little bit disappointed by the

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.800 
we were a little bit disappointed by the
experience<00:04:54.370> well<00:04:55.030> first<00:04:55.240> of<00:04:55.330> all<00:04:55.450> we<00:04:55.630> did

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
experience well first of all we did

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.390 
experience well first of all we did
notice<00:04:56.050> that<00:04:56.170> there<00:04:56.320> was<00:04:56.440> a<00:04:56.500> static<00:04:57.010> and<00:04:57.190> also

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
notice that there was a static and also

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.040 
notice that there was a static and also
back<00:04:57.610> on<00:04:57.640> noise<00:04:58.060> on<00:04:58.270> both<00:04:58.480> ends<00:04:58.810> of<00:04:58.930> our

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
back on noise on both ends of our

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.290 
back on noise on both ends of our
governmental<00:04:59.710> lines<00:05:00.040> so<00:05:00.700> it<00:05:00.910> made<00:05:01.030> a<00:05:01.060> real

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
governmental lines so it made a real

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.630 
governmental lines so it made a real
difficulty<00:05:01.840> our<00:05:01.930> conversations<00:05:02.740> at<00:05:03.280> the<00:05:03.490> same

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:03.640 
difficulty our conversations at the same

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.430 
difficulty our conversations at the same
time<00:05:03.910> the<00:05:04.450> speaker<00:05:04.930> was<00:05:05.080> a<00:05:05.110> little<00:05:05.350> bit

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
time the speaker was a little bit

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.190 
time the speaker was a little bit
lacking<00:05:05.650> in<00:05:05.950> power<00:05:06.220> so<00:05:06.700> it<00:05:06.760> also<00:05:07.200> contributed

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.200 
lacking in power so it also contributed

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.020 
lacking in power so it also contributed
to<00:05:08.290> that<00:05:08.440> when<00:05:09.280> we<00:05:09.430> switched<00:05:09.670> out<00:05:09.820> to<00:05:09.940> the

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 
to that when we switched out to the

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.760 
to that when we switched out to the
speakerphone<00:05:10.450> however<00:05:10.990> we<00:05:11.470> didn't<00:05:11.650> notice

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
speakerphone however we didn't notice

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.260 
speakerphone however we didn't notice
that<00:05:11.920> our<00:05:12.160> voices<00:05:12.460> sound<00:05:12.760> a<00:05:12.910> little<00:05:13.000> bit<00:05:13.240> more

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
that our voices sound a little bit more

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.450 
that our voices sound a little bit more
hollow<00:05:13.780> at<00:05:14.170> the<00:05:14.590> same<00:05:14.710> time<00:05:14.950> if<00:05:15.040> we<00:05:15.160> set<00:05:15.340> the

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
hollow at the same time if we set the

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.160 
hollow at the same time if we set the

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:17.170 
bond to its high setting it kind of

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:19.620 
bond to its high setting it kind of
strayed<00:05:17.500> a<00:05:17.530> little<00:05:17.800> bit<00:05:18.240> signal<00:05:19.240> strength<00:05:19.480> we
