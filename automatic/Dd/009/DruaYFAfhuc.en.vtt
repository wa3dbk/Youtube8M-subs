00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
and video on the one cable one thing I

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.450 
and video on the one cable one thing I
found<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.840> be<00:02:00.930> both<00:02:01.140> good<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.680> bad<00:02:01.770> is<00:02:02.189> that<00:02:02.369> it

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
found to be both good and bad is that it

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.429 
found to be both good and bad is that it
has<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.640> newer<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.210> faster<00:02:03.360> firewire<00:02:04.110> 800

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
has the newer and faster firewire 800

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.679 
has the newer and faster firewire 800
port<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.579> good<00:02:05.729> part<00:02:05.759> as<00:02:06.060> I<00:02:06.149> mentioned<00:02:06.570> is

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
port the good part as I mentioned is

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.330 
port the good part as I mentioned is
that<00:02:06.840> it's<00:02:06.960> faster<00:02:07.350> than<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.590> older<00:02:07.860> firewire

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
that it's faster than the older firewire

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.699 
that it's faster than the older firewire
400<00:02:08.910> port<00:02:09.149> but<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.780> bad<00:02:09.929> part<00:02:09.959> is<00:02:10.259> that<00:02:10.319> the<00:02:10.530> to

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
400 port but the bad part is that the to

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:11.330 
400 port but the bad part is that the to
use<00:02:10.950> different

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
use different

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.650 
use different
connections<00:02:11.790> so<00:02:12.180> I've<00:02:12.300> got<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.480> buy<00:02:12.629> a

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660
