you<00:02:06.940> know<00:02:07.060> it<00:02:07.240> females<00:02:07.660> in<00:02:08.170> Mertes<00:02:08.619> bar<00:02:08.860> I

you know it females in Mertes bar I

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:10.920 
you know it females in Mertes bar I
think<00:02:09.100> that's<00:02:09.280> a<00:02:09.369> huge<00:02:09.640> step<00:02:09.850> if<00:02:10.030> you<00:02:10.150> don't<00:02:10.330> do

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:10.930 
think that's a huge step if you don't do

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.000 
think that's a huge step if you don't do
things<00:02:11.140> or<00:02:11.410> you<00:02:11.470> don't<00:02:11.590> dares<00:02:11.830> to<00:02:11.920> be

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
things or you don't dares to be

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.080 
things or you don't dares to be
different<00:02:12.040> then<00:02:12.400> nothing's<00:02:12.700> gonna<00:02:12.820> change

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
different then nothing's gonna change

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.050 
different then nothing's gonna change
and<00:02:13.330> it's<00:02:13.450> not<00:02:13.570> gonna<00:02:13.690> stay<00:02:13.900> the<00:02:13.960> same<00:02:14.970> so<00:02:15.970> we

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
and it's not gonna stay the same so we

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.280 
and it's not gonna stay the same so we
started<00:02:16.390> off<00:02:16.510> on<00:02:17.080> a<00:02:17.790> 10<00:02:18.790> second<00:02:19.060> lap<00:02:19.180> and<00:02:19.750> we'd

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
started off on a 10 second lap and we'd

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.290
