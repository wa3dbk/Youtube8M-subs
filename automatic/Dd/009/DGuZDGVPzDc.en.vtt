the<00:00:45.370> reason<00:00:45.699> we<00:00:45.819> like<00:00:46.030> this<00:00:46.210> area<00:00:46.569> of<00:00:46.809> the

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
the reason we like this area of the

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.750 
the reason we like this area of the
court<00:00:47.440> along<00:00:47.710> the<00:00:47.859> baseline<00:00:48.190> when<00:00:48.460> you<00:00:48.550> serve

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
court along the baseline when you serve

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.939 
court along the baseline when you serve
is<00:00:48.999> that<00:00:49.030> gives<00:00:49.690> you<00:00:49.809> the<00:00:49.929> best<00:00:49.960> angle<00:00:50.589> for<00:00:50.620> all

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:50.949 
is that gives you the best angle for all

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:53.069 
is that gives you the best angle for all
of<00:00:51.249> the<00:00:51.370> three<00:00:51.550> major<00:00:51.819> target<00:00:52.389> areas<00:00:52.690> which<00:00:52.870> is

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
of the three major target areas which is

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.489 
of the three major target areas which is

disguises all three serves the returner
has<00:01:07.330> a<00:01:07.360> hard<00:01:07.720> time<00:01:07.990> recognizing<00:01:08.350> which<00:01:09.040> serve

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
has a hard time recognizing which serve

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.700 
has a hard time recognizing which serve
placement<00:01:09.940> ashley<00:01:10.330> is<00:01:10.420> going<00:01:10.540> to<00:01:10.600> hit<00:01:10.870> but

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
placement ashley is going to hit but

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.700 
placement ashley is going to hit but
also<00:01:12.130> understand<00:01:13.120> that<00:01:13.500> standing<00:01:14.500> here

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
also understand that standing here

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.650 
also understand that standing here
disguises<00:01:15.280> the<00:01:15.310> serve<00:01:15.640> but<00:01:16.180> you<00:01:16.360> want<00:01:16.570> to

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:16.660 
disguises the serve but you want to

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.900 
disguises the serve but you want to
recognize<00:01:17.140> as<00:01:17.470> a<00:01:17.530> server<00:01:17.920> what<00:01:18.280> your<00:01:18.490> strength

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:18.910 
recognize as a server what your strength

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.510 
recognize as a server what your strength
is<00:01:19.150> and<00:01:19.450> what<00:01:19.870> the<00:01:20.200> returners<00:01:20.710> weaknesses<00:01:21.310> are

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
is and what the returners weaknesses are

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.120 
is and what the returners weaknesses are
so<00:01:22.120> you<00:01:22.180> base<00:01:22.630> your<00:01:22.660> positioning<00:01:23.380> on<00:01:23.560> that<00:01:23.950> as

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
so you base your positioning on that as

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.360 
so you base your positioning on that as
well<00:01:24.400> so<00:01:25.060> let's<00:01:25.360> say<00:01:25.540> Ashley<00:01:25.750> served<00:01:26.260> out<00:01:27.010> wide

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:27.370 
well so let's say Ashley served out wide

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.400 
well so let's say Ashley served out wide
is<00:01:27.760> one<00:01:27.940> of<00:01:28.030> her<00:01:28.150> strengths<00:01:28.510> you'll<00:01:29.020> see<00:01:29.230> her

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
is one of her strengths you'll see her

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:31.650 
is one of her strengths you'll see her
typically<00:01:29.980> stand<00:01:30.280> a<00:01:30.550> little<00:01:30.880> bit<00:01:31.030> more<00:01:31.330> to<00:01:31.480> her

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
typically stand a little bit more to her

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.550 
typically stand a little bit more to her
right<00:01:31.900> on<00:01:32.140> the<00:01:32.170> out<00:01:32.410> wide<00:01:32.740> on<00:01:33.010> the<00:01:33.040> deuce<00:01:33.310> side

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
right on the out wide on the deuce side

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.290 
right on the out wide on the deuce side
by<00:01:35.560> serving<00:01:36.100> here<00:01:36.250> you<00:01:36.400> get<00:01:36.520> a<00:01:36.580> better<00:01:36.850> angle

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
by serving here you get a better angle

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.540 
by serving here you get a better angle
to<00:01:37.360> the<00:01:37.570> placement<00:01:37.870> but<00:01:38.650> you<00:01:38.830> also<00:01:39.010> want<00:01:39.340> to<00:01:39.400> be

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
to the placement but you also want to be

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.250 
to the placement but you also want to be
aware<00:01:39.580> that<00:01:39.910> you're<00:01:40.300> giving<00:01:40.600> up<00:01:40.720> the<00:01:40.900> disguise

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 
aware that you're giving up the disguise

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.690 
aware that you're giving up the disguise
factor<00:01:41.800> the<00:01:41.950> returner<00:01:42.280> is<00:01:42.430> going<00:01:42.640> to

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
factor the returner is going to

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.820 
factor the returner is going to
recognize<00:01:43.180> that<00:01:43.750> you're<00:01:43.930> more<00:01:44.140> likely<00:01:44.440> to<00:01:44.710> go

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
recognize that you're more likely to go

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.880 
recognize that you're more likely to go
out<00:01:44.860> wide<00:01:45.250> on<00:01:45.520> the<00:01:45.550> serve<00:01:45.910> as<00:01:46.210> well<00:01:46.990> as<00:01:47.050> it

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
out wide on the serve as well as it

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:49.440 
out wide on the serve as well as it
gives<00:01:48.070> them<00:01:48.340> an<00:01:48.490> opening<00:01:48.940> to<00:01:49.090> hit<00:01:49.270> their
