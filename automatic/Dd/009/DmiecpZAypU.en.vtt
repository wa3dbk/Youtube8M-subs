fixed<00:00:23.070> so<00:00:23.130> I<00:00:23.189> didn't<00:00:23.460> want<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.670> put<00:00:23.789> it<00:00:23.880> on<00:00:23.970> the

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
fixed so I didn't want to put it on the

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.759 
fixed so I didn't want to put it on the
YouTube<00:00:24.359> channel<00:00:24.390> but<00:00:25.080> even<00:00:25.320> without<00:00:25.410> putting

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
YouTube channel but even without putting

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.259 
YouTube channel but even without putting
it<00:00:25.949> on<00:00:26.039> my<00:00:26.160> youtube<00:00:26.430> channel<00:00:26.460> it<00:00:26.939> is<00:00:27.060> already

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
it on my youtube channel it is already

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.689 
it on my youtube channel it is already
like<00:00:27.570> half<00:00:27.810> full<00:00:28.080> and<00:00:28.230> we<00:00:29.130> did<00:00:29.279> upgrade<00:00:29.429> the

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
like half full and we did upgrade the

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.490 
like half full and we did upgrade the
server<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:30.179> four<00:00:30.480> gigabytes<00:00:30.900> of<00:00:30.990> RAM<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.380> it's

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
server to four gigabytes of RAM and it's

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.990 
server to four gigabytes of RAM and it's
actually<00:00:31.560> pretty<00:00:31.859> noticeable<00:00:32.430> upgrade

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
actually pretty noticeable upgrade

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.870 
actually pretty noticeable upgrade
because<00:00:33.120> before<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.809> was<00:00:34.020> um<00:00:34.520> 2.5<00:00:35.520> gigabytes

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
because before it was um 2.5 gigabytes

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.600 
because before it was um 2.5 gigabytes
so<00:00:36.270> we<00:00:36.570> upgrade<00:00:37.290> it's<00:00:37.500> almost<00:00:37.739> it's<00:00:38.070> like<00:00:38.190> you

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
so we upgrade it's almost it's like you

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.290 
so we upgrade it's almost it's like you
know<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:39.200> forty<00:00:40.200> percent<00:00:40.530> increase<00:00:41.040> in<00:00:41.070> RAM<00:00:42.059> so

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
know a forty percent increase in RAM so

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.479 
know a forty percent increase in RAM so
that's<00:00:42.420> pretty<00:00:42.570> good<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.010> I'm<00:00:44.010> excited<00:00:44.070> for

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489

also in there if you have lost pixelmon

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.639 
also in there if you have lost pixelmon
basically<00:01:54.869> how<00:01:54.990> we're<00:01:55.110> going<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.259> handle<00:01:55.320> this

if you lose a pixelmon because i know
that<00:01:59.820> was<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.060> huge<00:02:00.329> problem<00:02:00.659> before<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.140> this

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.420 
actually lose a pixelmon what i'm going
to<00:02:05.070> do<00:02:05.310> is

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430

to do is
you<00:02:06.490> can<00:02:06.850> basically<00:02:07.450> create<00:02:07.870> a<00:02:08.020> thread<00:02:08.320> and

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
you can basically create a thread and

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.710 
you can basically create a thread and
say<00:02:08.950> I<00:02:08.979> if<00:02:09.610> you<00:02:09.640> have<00:02:09.850> pictures<00:02:10.270> of<00:02:10.300> the

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
say I if you have pictures of the

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.200 
say I if you have pictures of the
pixelmon<00:02:11.140> say<00:02:11.710> I<00:02:11.920> lost<00:02:12.340> this<00:02:12.520> pixel<00:02:12.880> on<00:02:13.030> and

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
pixelmon say I lost this pixel on and

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.140 
pixelmon say I lost this pixel on and
then<00:02:13.570> post<00:02:13.870> pictures<00:02:14.140> of<00:02:14.320> all<00:02:14.770> of<00:02:14.800> your<00:02:15.190> your

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
then post pictures of all of your your

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.930 
then post pictures of all of your your
computer<00:02:16.690> slots<00:02:16.990> like<00:02:17.410> all<00:02:17.590> the<00:02:17.710> PC<00:02:18.070> slots<00:02:18.370> so

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
computer slots like all the PC slots so

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.820 
computer slots like all the PC slots so
we<00:02:19.390> could<00:02:19.540> check<00:02:19.780> those<00:02:19.930> pc<00:02:20.320> slots<00:02:20.620> if

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
we could check those pc slots if

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.949 
we could check those pc slots if
obviously<00:02:21.070> if<00:02:21.490> it's<00:02:21.610> not<00:02:21.760> there<00:02:21.970> we<00:02:22.180> can<00:02:22.360> go

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
obviously if it's not there we can go

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.360 
obviously if it's not there we can go
and<00:02:23.350> then<00:02:24.450> forget<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:25.630> pixel<00:02:25.930> on<00:02:26.080> and<00:02:26.290> go<00:02:27.190> from

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
and then forget the pixel on and go from

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.460 
and then forget the pixel on and go from
there<00:02:27.550> so<00:02:28.030> basically<00:02:28.360> yeah<00:02:28.660> I'm<00:02:28.870> really

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470

there so basically yeah I'm really
excited<00:02:29.650> for<00:02:29.830> this<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.190> server<00:02:30.520> is<00:02:30.640> finally

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
excited for this the server is finally

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.540 
excited for this the server is finally
up<00:02:31.630> I<00:02:31.900> think<00:02:32.590> I'm<00:02:32.650> gonna<00:02:32.740> be<00:02:32.860> doing<00:02:32.980> a<00:02:33.190> live

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
up I think I'm gonna be doing a live

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.870 
up I think I'm gonna be doing a live
stream<00:02:33.940> to<00:02:34.510> probably<00:02:35.350> two<00:02:35.830> later<00:02:36.370> today<00:02:36.640> so

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
stream to probably two later today so

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.060

I could go take the custom map and like

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.330 
I could go take the custom map and like
put<00:03:46.690> it<00:03:46.720> on<00:03:46.930> that<00:03:47.320> world<00:03:47.530> and<00:03:47.769> it'll<00:03:47.980> just<00:03:48.190> be

put it on that world and it'll just be

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.680 
put it on that world and it'll just be
that<00:03:48.549> and<00:03:48.730> then<00:03:48.820> obviously<00:03:48.940> week<00:03:49.329> everyone

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
that and then obviously week everyone

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.509 
that I don't know I thought that might
be<00:03:52.720> a<00:03:52.840> cool<00:03:53.049> idea<00:03:53.200> I'll<00:03:53.829> discuss<00:03:54.220> it<00:03:54.250> with<00:03:54.370> the
