key have to be on the power up that
socket<00:00:30.279> this<00:00:30.669> does<00:00:30.939> not<00:00:31.210> have<00:00:31.450> to<00:00:31.599> be<00:00:31.720> on<00:00:31.869> okay

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:32.410 
socket this does not have to be on okay

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:33.810 
socket this does not have to be on okay
I'm<00:00:32.619> gonna<00:00:32.770> ask<00:00:32.890> how<00:00:33.070> were<00:00:33.220> there<00:00:33.370> all<00:00:33.520> times

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
I'm gonna ask how were there all times

coming on it's not coming on so where

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.850 
coming on it's not coming on so where
would<00:00:42.370> we<00:00:42.489> go<00:00:42.640> to<00:00:42.700> check<00:00:42.970> the<00:00:43.120> fuse<00:00:43.329> for<00:00:43.360> that

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
would we go to check the fuse for that

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.549 
would we go to check the fuse for that
under<00:00:44.860> the<00:00:44.980> hood<00:00:45.210> nice<00:00:46.210> take<00:00:46.480> a<00:00:46.510> look<00:00:46.719> we're<00:00:47.469> on

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
under the hood nice take a look we're on

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:50.849 
under the hood nice take a look we're on
the<00:00:47.800> driver<00:00:48.250> side<00:00:48.429> under<00:00:49.059> the<00:00:49.090> hood<00:00:49.420> and<00:00:49.870> we

00:00:50.849 --> 00:00:50.859 
the driver side under the hood and we

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:54.299 
the driver side under the hood and we
got<00:00:50.980> a<00:00:51.010> box<00:00:51.280> right<00:00:51.550> here<00:00:52.379> this<00:00:53.379> would<00:00:53.589> be<00:00:53.829> your

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
got a box right here this would be your

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.139 
got a box right here this would be your
fuse<00:00:54.789> access<00:00:55.600> okay<00:00:56.440> so<00:00:57.370> what<00:00:57.519> fuse<00:00:57.789> would<00:00:57.940> I<00:00:57.969> be

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
fuse access okay so what fuse would I be

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:00.509 
fuse access okay so what fuse would I be
looking<00:00:58.300> for<00:00:58.480> if<00:00:58.780> I<00:00:58.929> need<00:00:59.109> to<00:00:59.410> replace<00:01:00.190> the

00:01:00.509 --> 00:01:00.519 
looking for if I need to replace the

look at our display here and we look
under<00:01:09.490> see<00:01:09.700> for<00:01:09.940> cigarette<00:01:10.420> lighter<00:01:10.630> and<00:01:10.810> we

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
under see for cigarette lighter and we

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.290 
under see for cigarette lighter and we
see<00:01:11.350> that<00:01:11.680> we're<00:01:11.860> looking<00:01:12.040> for<00:01:12.220> fuse<00:01:13.000> number

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 
see that we're looking for fuse number

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.080 
see that we're looking for fuse number
32<00:01:13.960> okay<00:01:14.470> in<00:01:14.710> our<00:01:14.800> location<00:01:15.370> of<00:01:15.730> that

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.300 

what<00:01:19.090> are<00:01:19.180> you<00:01:19.270> right<00:01:19.479> here<00:01:19.930> yep<00:01:20.290> so<00:01:21.009> there's

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
what are you right here yep so there's

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.280 
what are you right here yep so there's
the<00:01:21.520> shape<00:01:21.700> of<00:01:21.909> the<00:01:22.030> box<00:01:22.270> okay<00:01:22.780> so<00:01:22.840> let's<00:01:23.170> see

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
the shape of the box okay so let's see

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.240 
the shape of the box okay so let's see
if<00:01:23.350> we<00:01:23.409> can<00:01:23.560> find<00:01:23.740> that<00:01:23.860> fuse<00:01:25.170> okay<00:01:26.170> so<00:01:26.680> going

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
if we can find that fuse okay so going

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.810 
if we can find that fuse okay so going
by<00:01:27.549> 31<00:01:28.299> to<00:01:28.450> 46<00:01:29.020> this<00:01:29.229> will<00:01:29.409> be<00:01:29.590> fuse<00:01:30.040> number<00:01:30.369> 31

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
by 31 to 46 this will be fuse number 31

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.850 
by 31 to 46 this will be fuse number 31
and<00:01:31.030> well<00:01:31.420> look<00:01:31.689> there's<00:01:32.049> no<00:01:32.229> fuse<00:01:32.560> there

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
and well look there's no fuse there

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.069 
and well look there's no fuse there
that's<00:01:33.700> because<00:01:33.909> I<00:01:34.000> stole<00:01:34.240> it<00:01:34.450> sorry

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:35.079 
that's because I stole it sorry

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:37.859 
that's because I stole it sorry
Oh<00:01:35.200> he<00:01:35.950> stole<00:01:36.310> my<00:01:36.670> 30<00:01:37.030> amp<00:01:37.240> fuse<00:01:37.509> for<00:01:37.750> my

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
Oh he stole my 30 amp fuse for my

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:40.560 
Oh he stole my 30 amp fuse for my
cigarette<00:01:38.170> lighter<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:39.700> if<00:01:39.909> we<00:01:40.060> reinstall

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
cigarette lighter so if we reinstall

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.100 
cigarette lighter so if we reinstall
that<00:01:40.600> chances<00:01:41.350> are<00:01:41.560> it'll<00:01:42.009> probably<00:01:42.280> work<00:01:43.110> now

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
that chances are it'll probably work now

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:46.609 
that chances are it'll probably work now
it<00:01:44.320> is<00:01:44.439> common<00:01:44.890> to<00:01:45.070> plug<00:01:45.789> something<00:01:46.060> into<00:01:46.329> that

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
it is common to plug something into that

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.380 
it is common to plug something into that
socket<00:01:47.619> and<00:01:48.039> accidentally<00:01:48.579> arc<00:01:48.789> it<00:01:48.939> out<00:01:49.090> or

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
socket and accidentally arc it out or

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.569 
socket and accidentally arc it out or
ever<00:01:49.750> even<00:01:49.899> seen<00:01:50.289> penny<00:01:50.530> stuck<00:01:50.950> on<00:01:51.130> the<00:01:51.250> bottom

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:51.579 
ever even seen penny stuck on the bottom

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:53.490 
ever even seen penny stuck on the bottom
of<00:01:51.729> them<00:01:51.850> which<00:01:52.360> would<00:01:52.539> definitely<00:01:52.719> pop<00:01:53.229> that

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
of them which would definitely pop that

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.830 
of them which would definitely pop that
fuse<00:01:53.829> and<00:01:54.340> so<00:01:54.759> this<00:01:55.000> is<00:01:55.149> where<00:01:55.299> you<00:01:55.420> would<00:01:55.539> go

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
fuse and so this is where you would go

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.719 
fuse and so this is where you would go
obviously<00:01:56.619> we're<00:01:56.799> simulating<00:01:57.100> a<00:01:57.490> blown<00:01:57.700> fuse

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
obviously we're simulating a blown fuse

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.319 
obviously we're simulating a blown fuse
just<00:01:58.299> by<00:01:58.899> removing<00:01:59.439> it<00:01:59.590> to<00:02:00.520> really<00:02:00.850> check<00:02:01.149> it

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329 
just by removing it to really check it

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:02.910 
just by removing it to really check it
you<00:02:01.420> could<00:02:01.570> look<00:02:01.689> across<00:02:01.960> that<00:02:02.079> element<00:02:02.740> and

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
you could look across that element and

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.069 
you could look across that element and
if<00:02:03.490> you<00:02:03.609> have<00:02:03.729> this<00:02:03.880> style<00:02:04.090> fuse<00:02:04.570> usually

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:05.079 
if you have this style fuse usually

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:06.090 
if you have this style fuse usually
you'll<00:02:05.229> see<00:02:05.530> it's<00:02:05.649> burnt

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
you'll see it's burnt

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.950 
you'll see it's burnt
it'll<00:02:06.700> be<00:02:06.909> burnt<00:02:07.240> right<00:02:07.450> in<00:02:07.570> the<00:02:07.659> center

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
it'll be burnt right in the center

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.630 
it'll be burnt right in the center
although<00:02:08.259> sometimes<00:02:08.530> it's<00:02:08.950> deceiving<00:02:09.490> and

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
although sometimes it's deceiving and

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.210 
although sometimes it's deceiving and
the<00:02:10.210> burn<00:02:10.450> might<00:02:11.050> not<00:02:11.290> be<00:02:11.440> a<00:02:11.470> full<00:02:11.770> burn<00:02:12.010> all

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
the burn might not be a full burn all

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.680 
the burn might not be a full burn all
the<00:02:12.340> way<00:02:12.370> through<00:02:12.790> even<00:02:13.000> though<00:02:13.330> you<00:02:13.390> have<00:02:13.660> a

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
the way through even though you have a

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.810 
the way through even though you have a
voltage<00:02:13.990> drop<00:02:14.350> across<00:02:14.620> it<00:02:14.740> and<00:02:15.130> it's<00:02:15.670> not

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
voltage drop across it and it's not

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:16.980 
voltage drop across it and it's not
enough<00:02:16.060> to<00:02:16.210> power<00:02:16.390> up<00:02:16.600> that<00:02:16.780> cigarette

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
enough to power up that cigarette

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.780 
enough to power up that cigarette
lighter<00:02:17.350> so<00:02:17.650> when<00:02:17.860> in<00:02:18.010> doubt<00:02:18.160> go<00:02:18.430> ahead<00:02:18.640> and

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
lighter so when in doubt go ahead and

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.700 
lighter so when in doubt go ahead and
replace<00:02:19.000> that<00:02:19.270> with<00:02:19.480> the<00:02:19.600> same<00:02:19.810> size<00:02:20.140> amperage

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
replace that with the same size amperage

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.920 
replace that with the same size amperage
fuse<00:02:21.640> which<00:02:21.940> I<00:02:22.150> don't<00:02:22.210> know<00:02:22.420> what<00:02:22.600> what

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
fuse which I don't know what what

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.410 
fuse which I don't know what what
amperage<00:02:23.260> was<00:02:23.440> that<00:02:23.620> fuse<00:02:23.860> that<00:02:24.400> is<00:02:24.700> a<00:02:24.910> 30<00:02:25.240> amp

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
amperage was that fuse that is a 30 amp

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.300 
amperage was that fuse that is a 30 amp
fuse<00:02:25.810> okay

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
fuse okay

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.740 
fuse okay
would<00:02:26.520> make<00:02:26.670> some<00:02:26.850> sense<00:02:27.030> let's<00:02:27.360> go<00:02:27.480> check<00:02:27.690> it

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
would make some sense let's go check it

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.480 
would make some sense let's go check it
out<00:02:27.900> and<00:02:28.050> see<00:02:28.200> if<00:02:28.290> it's<00:02:28.410> lighting<00:02:28.800> up<00:02:28.890> now<00:02:29.100> you

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
out and see if it's lighting up now you

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.160 
out and see if it's lighting up now you
have<00:02:29.610> that<00:02:29.790> device<00:02:30.150> to<00:02:30.180> plug<00:02:30.569> in<00:02:30.750> and<00:02:30.870> see<00:02:31.020> what

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
have that device to plug in and see what

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.760 
have that device to plug in and see what
happens

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
happens

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:38.690 
happens
yep<00:02:32.450> absolutely<00:02:33.450> oh<00:02:36.590> yeah<00:02:37.590> look<00:02:37.920> at<00:02:37.980> that<00:02:38.040> that

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
yep absolutely oh yeah look at that that

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.880 
yep absolutely oh yeah look at that that
LED<00:02:39.180> lit<00:02:39.390> up<00:02:39.540> right<00:02:39.780> there<00:02:40.020> you<00:02:40.319> can<00:02:40.470> hear<00:02:40.709> the

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
LED lit up right there you can hear the

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.309 
LED lit up right there you can hear the
fan<00:02:41.130> going<00:02:41.430> on<00:02:41.700> that<00:02:41.940> that's<00:02:42.780> pretty<00:02:43.050> fancy

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
fan going on that that's pretty fancy

right there yep that's what you need if
you<00:02:46.770> have<00:02:46.860> multiple<00:02:47.400> electric<00:02:47.850> devices<00:02:48.180> you

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
you have multiple electric devices you

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.199 
you have multiple electric devices you
need<00:02:48.600> to<00:02:48.690> charge<00:02:48.870> jeez<00:02:49.880> surprised<00:02:50.880> you<00:02:51.030> don't

need to charge jeez surprised you don't
blow<00:02:51.360> your<00:02:51.510> fuse
