 It is English Today is on the pastel side 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:20.780
 With heart pastel 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:24.900
 It is great if you want to see even the level about the difference of soft pastels 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:27.990
 Well then, this is the hard pastel of N ブ ー ル buru 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:33.540
 I want to also see sacrifice and say I should try doing what Fu 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:35.010
 Here it was the 's mountain hundred average of making fun taken out 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.480
 Well this is it 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.200
 Wind up the pastel on 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.090
 I'm shaving 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.630
 Say Then 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.930
 It became the same 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:48.970
 Same 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.970
 Soft Path Let's also know this 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.640
 As much 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:59.700
 It's a little bit different 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.700
 I will say what will happen with this 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.080
 I have always use 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.670
 Let's stretch on 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.060
 Then 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.460
 In this way 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.030
 Has grown 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.030
 Well then 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.210
 Speaking of 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.690
 What difference is it? 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:37.460
 I pretty 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:43.610
 The way of growth recovers very beautifully. 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:44.450
 Compared to soft pastels, hard pastels have a strong sense of dryness and a little rough feeling 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.520
 is 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.799
 Rubbing with your finger 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.799
 It looks like this, but with another finger 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.930
 Then another at all 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.500
 The rate of growth is 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.500
 That's right 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:04.450
 The fixing is also really is more of a rush of here soft soft'm Day 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:12.560
 Such a feeling is totally different 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.560
 Soft lanes are easy to stretch evenly 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.750
 Feel 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:24.450
 Something a little naughty perfect 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:29.000
 It looks like only me or everyone, so the next review
