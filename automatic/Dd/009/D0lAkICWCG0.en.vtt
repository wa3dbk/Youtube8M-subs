00:00:01.409 --> 00:00:06.670
 hello everyone my name is drain Dima and I'm kind of like a company knife specialist 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.920
 photos today we have on the test one interesting novelty from the company spider to 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:20.710
 here it is called this knife spyderco caly 3 and 5 where respectively 35 is 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:26.039
 the length of the product in. Well, let's go 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:40.610
 it is exceptionally pleasant to hold this knife in your hand, it feels natural 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.780
 the continuation of your hands and believe me I do not exaggerate 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.710
 look at the form it is extremely ergonomic and calculated to the millimeter 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.060
 there is an emphasis under the thumb under the index finger on the back 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.410
 there is a clip that is easily removed and indeed the whole knife is taken apart 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.580
 literally double counting 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.200
 as you see less often a spider to exceptionally well it is a merit of direct 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.240
 low angle sharpening and of course 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:17.210
 exceptional in its characteristics of materials because powdered steel of HPP 189 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.940
 at the moment perhaps one of the hardest steels in the world such 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.500
 exceptional steel stiffness characteristics make our knife's cutting edge 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.450
 surprisingly resilient speaking human language can be used 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.530
 This knife spider for a long time before he needs it. 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.270
 it may be a month or two and even more depending on how intense 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.090
 you will use your blade until our test I used a knife 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.369
 spyderco about a week like an ordinary everyday wearing knife i 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:59.840
 cut the shelves tied up the laces opened the cows and cut the cardboard paper vegetables in general 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.110
 a lot of things, that is, a knife is idle 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.369
 and now we will do a little test to see how good 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:12.319
 blade material is how solid our steel is and how well it keeps sharpening and 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:18.970
 so the faint of heart please move away from the screen we start 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.579
 as you can see the spyderco caly knife really shaves after a week of work 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:38.260
 from my own experience I will tell you that this is the only penknife on my 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.510
 memory which would remain as acute after intensive use and 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.900
 merit in the material the blade is covered on both sides with carbon lining thickness 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.829
 about 2 millimeters carbon of exceptional quality plays beautifully 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:57.730
 in the sun and in general it is pleasant to touch the thickness of the butt of our knife 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.250
 three and a half millimeters and it narrows to almost zero end of the blade 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.659
 again along the blade itself there is a weld between two types of steel 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:12.909
 here we can see when the run-over goes over the blade core produced in 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:19.090
 japan here please marking japan liners steel knife blades practically 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.280
 It doesnâ€™t flare, and in which case it can be easily 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:28.329
 pull up a spider cocoa exceptionally well in the pocket because it 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:34.930
 flat I generally said that this is one of the most convenient knives for everyday 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:42.870
 wearing 1 and 2 opens the knife elementary we see the classic 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:49.739
 the spider's hole is among other things patented, or we do it like this 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:57.580
 or for more sophisticated users, you can effectively open the knife like this 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.810
 please it closes by pressing this recess on this let's lock 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:13.209
 lever-type o opens the knife naturally closes with one hand to give 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.019
 as for me, the only minus of the penknife spider as alize baby 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:24.790
 189 its price but it is a payment for materials of the highest level 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:30.820
 acquiring a similar product you buy a reliable and loyal friend for long 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.030
 years so don't skimp on the good thing 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.630
 to tell the truth spider cocoa one of the most interesting penknives 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.740
 midsize i've dealt with he is amazing 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:48.190
 beautiful ergonomic and perhaps the most technologically advanced pen 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:54.520
 I liked the knife in the line of the company so much that most likely I will not return 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:01.290
 buy it back and buy it and leave it to yourself and wish you
