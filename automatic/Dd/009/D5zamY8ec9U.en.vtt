00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.950
 here 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.699
 i 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.279
 hello female friends present I am cole 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.619
 of sepi foundation and today we have a 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.320
 invitation who did not have an afternoon 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:29.130
 boring with children in the good house 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.259
 today we are going to make key rings 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.190
 magnets for the refrigerator and all that 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:35.559
 with salt dough 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:39.489
 to be able to make it the materials that 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:43.829
 we need are a cup of medium flour 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:46.710
 cup of salt half a cup of hot water 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.049
 container and mixing palette 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.379
 food coloring and different 

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:56.440
 objects to make entrepreneurs rings 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:58.809
 refrigerator magnets keychains or 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.140
 what you can think of is going to take the 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:01.140
 flour 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.770
 and we are going to put in the container 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.580
 you are going to put salt 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:18.170
 and you will be adding hot water 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.360
 little by little and you're going to stir 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.240
 when the water has already mixed with the 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.400
 flour the palette will no longer serve you and 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.930
 you're going to have to start using the 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:33.600
 hands the consistency is more or less like this 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:35.549
 there to take the hands and masses 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.180
 so that it becomes a good mix 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.759
 homogeneous you continue kneading until 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.280
 the consistency of the dough is smooth 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.890
 Do not stick in your hands and if they stick 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.680
 be a little bit of flour and continue 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.860
 kneading and then we divide it into three 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.770
 deposits 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.630
 and we will add color the amount 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.560
 of droplets will depend on the intensity 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.240
 that you want to give to the dough once 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.730
 that you added the color to the mass 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.620
 You have to keep kneading until you achieve 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.899
 homogenous colors like the ones that take me 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.720
 if you mix the masses of colors 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:15.410
 primary will achieve new colors 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.690
 and then sit down to enjoy together 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.540
 your son or daughter let fly the 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:24.260
 imagination and believe all those 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.930
 shapes figures that come to mind and 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:30.620
 they could spend an afternoon together when creating 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.930
 the mass and also when creating new shapes 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.000
 once you have them ready 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.490
 take them to the sun so that they harden 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.730
 here we have figures that are ready 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:43.000
 we put them in the sun and they are already dry and 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.470
 We transform them into different 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.810
 accessories 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:53.020
 fish we did it and more for the 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:53.020
 refrigerator here we made a ring 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:59.150
 and this is a keychain house remember that 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.300
 playing with your children is a very good 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:04.940
 gift for them and for you I am also
