00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
like everyone else taking a class and I

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.759 
like everyone else taking a class and I
saw<00:00:12.839> this<00:00:13.080> guy<00:00:13.349> up<00:00:13.559> there<00:00:13.740> talk

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:14.769

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:16.380 
saw this guy up there talk
incredibly<00:00:15.249> interesting<00:00:15.820> stuff<00:00:16.090> about

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:16.390 
incredibly interesting stuff about

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.779 
incredibly interesting stuff about
animal<00:00:16.779> behavior<00:00:16.900> and<00:00:17.590> then<00:00:17.710> later<00:00:18.460> about

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:18.789 
animal behavior and then later about

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:21.029 
animal behavior and then later about
child<00:00:19.180> behavior<00:00:19.660> and<00:00:19.869> it<00:00:20.529> just<00:00:20.740> occurred<00:00:21.009> to

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:21.039 
child behavior and it just occurred to

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:23.130 
child behavior and it just occurred to
me<00:00:21.160> wow<00:00:21.490> they're<00:00:21.849> paying<00:00:22.119> him<00:00:22.300> to<00:00:22.480> do<00:00:22.599> this<00:00:22.779> and

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.140 
me wow they're paying him to do this and

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.929 
me wow they're paying him to do this and
I<00:00:23.199> thought<00:00:23.439> that's<00:00:23.860> a<00:00:24.009> good<00:00:24.160> job<00:00:24.369> I<00:00:24.640> think<00:00:24.849> I

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:24.939 
I thought that's a good job I think I

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:28.960 
I thought that's a good job I think I
want<00:00:25.090> to<00:00:25.150> do<00:00:25.270> that

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.850 

one<00:00:29.970> of<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.120> things<00:00:30.240> that<00:00:30.360> care

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:30.860 
one of the things that care

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.650 
one of the things that care
Piaget<00:00:31.160> is<00:00:31.490> he<00:00:31.640> kind<00:00:31.760> of<00:00:31.910> looks<00:00:32.090> at<00:00:32.240> children

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
Piaget is he kind of looks at children

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.540 
Piaget is he kind of looks at children
like<00:00:32.990> they're<00:00:33.200> another<00:00:33.470> species<00:00:33.980> you're

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
like they're another species you're

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.420 
like they're another species you're
looking<00:00:34.850> at<00:00:34.940> them<00:00:35.090> from<00:00:35.270> a<00:00:35.330> distance<00:00:35.510> and<00:00:36.430> and

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:37.430 
looking at them from a distance and and

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:38.740 
looking at them from a distance and and
when<00:00:37.640> you<00:00:37.730> start<00:00:38.030> looking<00:00:38.240> at<00:00:38.300> children<00:00:38.450> like

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
when you start looking at children like

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.530 
when you start looking at children like
that<00:00:38.960> and<00:00:39.200> you<00:00:39.260> make<00:00:39.380> the<00:00:39.500> comparison<00:00:40.070> to

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
that and you make the comparison to

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.510 
that and you make the comparison to
animals<00:00:41.540> well<00:00:42.350> it's<00:00:42.680> just<00:00:42.800> I<00:00:43.130> think<00:00:43.250> it's

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
animals well it's just I think it's

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.250 
animals well it's just I think it's
naturally<00:00:43.940> fascinating<00:00:44.510> to<00:00:44.600> everyone<00:00:44.960> I'm<00:00:45.110> no

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
naturally fascinating to everyone I'm no

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:53.410 
naturally fascinating to everyone I'm no
different

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.580 

in<00:00:54.420> our<00:00:54.570> most<00:00:54.720> recent<00:00:54.840> work<00:00:55.290> we've<00:00:55.560> been

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
in our most recent work we've been

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.150 
in our most recent work we've been
focused<00:00:56.460> on<00:00:56.600> cooperation<00:00:57.600> so<00:00:58.290> in<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.920> past

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
focused on cooperation so in the past

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.860 
focused on cooperation so in the past
we've<00:00:59.400> looked<00:00:59.610> at<00:00:59.790> social<00:01:00.240> cognition<00:01:00.570> in

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
we've looked at social cognition in

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.780 
we've looked at social cognition in
general<00:01:01.260> how<00:01:01.500> individuals<00:01:02.070> understand<00:01:02.580> one

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 
general how individuals understand one

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.320 
general how individuals understand one
another<00:01:03.559> but<00:01:04.559> now<00:01:05.010> what<00:01:05.850> we<00:01:05.970> think<00:01:06.210> really

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
another but now what we think really

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.000 
another but now what we think really
makes<00:01:06.630> humans<00:01:06.990> different<00:01:07.050> compared<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:07.890> our

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
makes humans different compared to our

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.250 
makes humans different compared to our
nearest<00:01:08.610> primate<00:01:08.820> relatives<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:10.170> way

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
nearest primate relatives is the way

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.380 
nearest primate relatives is the way
they<00:01:10.380> put<00:01:10.590> their<00:01:10.710> heads<00:01:10.920> together<00:01:11.100> so<00:01:11.670> we're

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
they put their heads together so we're

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.230 
they put their heads together so we're
looking<00:01:12.990> at<00:01:13.050> how<00:01:13.110> children<00:01:13.640> form<00:01:14.640> joint<00:01:14.970> goals

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
looking at how children form joint goals

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.030 
looking at how children form joint goals
and<00:01:15.540> decide<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.840> do<00:01:16.229> something<00:01:16.470> together

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
and decide to do something together

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.310 
and decide to do something together
how<00:01:17.460> they<00:01:17.640> plan<00:01:17.970> together<00:01:18.300> to<00:01:18.570> make<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.110> happen

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
how they plan together to make it happen

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.800 
how they plan together to make it happen
how<00:01:20.220> they<00:01:20.340> divide<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.880> spoils<00:01:21.360> at<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.630> end

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
how they divide the spoils at the end

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.749 
how they divide the spoils at the end
this<00:01:22.530> is<00:01:22.680> something<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.009> chimpanzees<00:01:23.640> have

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
this is something that chimpanzees have

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.780 
this is something that chimpanzees have
a<00:01:23.820> lot<00:01:24.000> of<00:01:24.030> trouble<00:01:24.450> with<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:25.550> they<00:01:26.550> may<00:01:26.729> do

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
a lot of trouble with that they may do

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.310 
a lot of trouble with that they may do
something<00:01:26.970> collaborative<00:01:27.900> but<00:01:28.050> then<00:01:28.200> they

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
something collaborative but then they

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.719 
something collaborative but then they
fight<00:01:28.530> over<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.890> food<00:01:29.040> at<00:01:29.190> the<00:01:29.310> end<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:29.610> so

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
fight over the food at the end and so

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.249 
fight over the food at the end and so
they<00:01:29.850> can't<00:01:30.119> maintain<00:01:30.300> the<00:01:30.630> collaboration

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
they can't maintain the collaboration

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.890 
they can't maintain the collaboration
over<00:01:31.500> time<00:01:31.820> and<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:33.240> we're<00:01:33.479> looking<00:01:33.600> at<00:01:33.810> a

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
over time and so we're looking at a

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.280 
over time and so we're looking at a
whole<00:01:34.110> variety<00:01:34.320> of<00:01:34.740> aspects<00:01:35.610> of

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
whole variety of aspects of

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:52.840 
whole variety of aspects of
collaboration

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.410 

about<00:01:53.570> a<00:01:53.810> decade<00:01:54.230> ago

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
about a decade ago

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.200 
about a decade ago
everyone<00:01:55.840> sort<00:01:56.110> of<00:01:56.200> believed<00:01:56.590> that<00:01:57.210> great

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
everyone sort of believed that great

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.719 
everyone sort of believed that great
apes<00:01:58.420> really<00:01:59.259> didn't<00:01:59.590> understand<00:02:00.159> the<00:02:00.400> mental

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
apes really didn't understand the mental

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.700 
apes really didn't understand the mental
states<00:02:00.970> or<00:02:01.240> the<00:02:01.330> minds<00:02:01.540> of<00:02:01.750> others<00:02:01.990> at<00:02:02.530> all

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
states or the minds of others at all

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.080 
states or the minds of others at all
that<00:02:03.009> was<00:02:03.130> probably<00:02:03.369> the<00:02:03.549> majority<00:02:03.670> opinion

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
that was probably the majority opinion

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.960 
that was probably the majority opinion
and<00:02:04.600> then<00:02:05.290> in<00:02:05.530> the<00:02:05.680> last<00:02:05.890> decade<00:02:06.340> a<00:02:06.610> lot<00:02:06.880> of

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
and then in the last decade a lot of

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.490 
and then in the last decade a lot of
research<00:02:07.240> has<00:02:07.390> come<00:02:07.570> out<00:02:07.750> that<00:02:07.960> indeed<00:02:08.170> they

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
research has come out that indeed they

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.460 
research has come out that indeed they
do<00:02:08.560> but<00:02:09.489> our<00:02:09.759> working<00:02:10.539> hypothesis<00:02:11.260> has<00:02:11.440> been

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
do but our working hypothesis has been

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.440 
do but our working hypothesis has been
that<00:02:11.860> they<00:02:12.010> are<00:02:12.250> doing<00:02:12.580> that<00:02:12.730> in<00:02:13.000> order<00:02:13.270> to

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
that they are doing that in order to

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.270 
that they are doing that in order to
compete<00:02:13.750> with<00:02:13.930> one<00:02:14.110> another<00:02:14.140> so<00:02:14.950> they're

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
compete with one another so they're

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.530 
compete with one another so they're
trying<00:02:15.610> to<00:02:15.640> figure<00:02:15.819> out<00:02:16.000> what<00:02:16.120> the<00:02:16.239> other<00:02:16.360> one

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
trying to figure out what the other one

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.199 
trying to figure out what the other one

this tool here's the right way to play
this<00:03:05.760> game<00:03:06.000> and<00:03:06.380> we've<00:03:07.380> seen<00:03:07.650> some<00:03:07.830> absolutely

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
this game and we've seen some absolutely

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.850 
this game and we've seen some absolutely
fascinating<00:03:09.500> studies<00:03:10.500> with<00:03:10.650> young<00:03:10.830> children

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
fascinating studies with young children

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.699 
fascinating studies with young children
where<00:03:11.790> they<00:03:12.330> see<00:03:12.390> someone<00:03:13.020> else<00:03:13.230> doing

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
where they see someone else doing

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.970 
where they see someone else doing
something<00:03:13.739> in<00:03:14.420> the<00:03:15.420> wrong<00:03:15.569> way<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:16.260> they<00:03:16.739> come

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
something in the wrong way and they come

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.860 
something in the wrong way and they come
in<00:03:17.070> they<00:03:17.220> say<00:03:17.370> no<00:03:17.580> no<00:03:17.970> not<00:03:18.239> like<00:03:18.480> that<00:03:18.510> it

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
in they say no no not like that it

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.240 
in they say no no not like that it
doesn't<00:03:19.019> work<00:03:19.230> like<00:03:19.500> that<00:03:19.530> you<00:03:19.709> have<00:03:19.920> to<00:03:20.040> do<00:03:20.130> it

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
doesn't work like that you have to do it

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.430 
doesn't work like that you have to do it
like<00:03:20.370> this<00:03:20.640> so<00:03:20.910> there's<00:03:21.720> this<00:03:21.989> sense<00:03:22.410> of

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
like this so there's this sense of

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.780 
like this so there's this sense of
objective<00:03:25.440> right<00:03:25.830> and<00:03:26.070> wrong<00:03:26.220> ways<00:03:26.430> of<00:03:26.640> doing

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
objective right and wrong ways of doing

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.910 
objective right and wrong ways of doing
things<00:03:27.150> that<00:03:27.390> there's<00:03:27.630> a<00:03:27.690> norm<00:03:28.200> that<00:03:28.560> needs<00:03:28.739> to

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
things that there's a norm that needs to

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.970 
things that there's a norm that needs to
be<00:03:29.030> that<00:03:30.030> needs<00:03:30.209> to<00:03:30.360> be<00:03:30.390> met<00:03:30.690> and<00:03:30.870> and<00:03:31.560> it's

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
be that needs to be met and and it's

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.309 
be that needs to be met and and it's
easy<00:03:32.310> to<00:03:32.459> understand<00:03:32.940> why<00:03:33.000> children<00:03:33.319> follow

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
easy to understand why children follow

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.290 
easy to understand why children follow
norms<00:03:34.830> you<00:03:35.010> follow<00:03:35.250> norms<00:03:35.670> to<00:03:35.819> conform<00:03:36.239> to

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
norms you follow norms to conform to

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.240 
norms you follow norms to conform to
people<00:03:36.630> and<00:03:36.810> to<00:03:36.959> fit<00:03:37.530> in<00:03:37.650> and<00:03:37.830> whatnot

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
people and to fit in and whatnot

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.100 
people and to fit in and whatnot
but<00:03:38.489> why<00:03:38.700> do<00:03:38.760> you<00:03:38.910> enforce<00:03:39.450> them<00:03:39.720> that's<00:03:39.989> a

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
but why do you enforce them that's a

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.990 
but why do you enforce them that's a
little<00:03:40.290> harder<00:03:40.620> to<00:03:40.709> understand<00:03:41.190> but<00:03:41.790> there's

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
little harder to understand but there's

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.140 
little harder to understand but there's
something<00:03:42.540> about<00:03:43.670> representing<00:03:44.670> the<00:03:44.819> group

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
something about representing the group

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.540 
something about representing the group
and<00:03:45.480> it's<00:03:45.660> ways<00:03:45.930> of<00:03:46.200> doing<00:03:46.350> things<00:03:46.769> and<00:03:47.160> if<00:03:47.430> you

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
and it's ways of doing things and if you

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.310 
and it's ways of doing things and if you
want<00:03:47.730> to<00:03:47.819> be<00:03:47.910> one<00:03:48.090> of<00:03:48.180> us<00:03:48.330> this<00:03:48.600> is<00:03:48.660> the<00:03:48.900> way<00:03:48.989> we

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
want to be one of us this is the way we

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.310 
want to be one of us this is the way we
do<00:03:49.500> it<00:03:49.650> we<00:03:49.920> do<00:03:50.130> it<00:03:50.160> like<00:03:50.370> this<00:03:50.690> those<00:03:51.690> guys<00:03:51.720> over

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
do it we do it like this those guys over

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.020 
do it we do it like this those guys over
across<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:52.680> river<00:03:53.010> they<00:03:53.310> do<00:03:53.370> it<00:03:53.610> completely

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
across the river they do it completely

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.789 
across the river they do it completely
different<00:03:54.420> they<00:03:54.570> eat<00:03:54.810> disgusting<00:03:55.560> things

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799

they dress funny they talk funny we do

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.530 
they dress funny they talk funny we do
it<00:03:58.470> like<00:03:58.650> this<00:03:58.860> if<00:03:59.130> you<00:03:59.940> want<00:04:00.090> to<00:04:00.150> be<00:04:00.239> with<00:04:00.390> one
