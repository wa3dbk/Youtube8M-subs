we're<00:02:06.960> just<00:02:06.990> gonna<00:02:07.170> drill<00:02:07.469> and<00:02:07.649> tap<00:02:07.679> those

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
we're just gonna drill and tap those

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.830 
we're just gonna drill and tap those
holes<00:02:08.369> right<00:02:09.119> here<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.450> then<00:02:09.539> we<00:02:09.629> should<00:02:09.690> be

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
holes right here and then we should be

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.229 
holes right here and then we should be
done<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.319> ready<00:02:10.349> to<00:02:10.590> go<00:02:10.739> okay<00:02:11.730> what<00:02:12.120> we're

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
doing here is I just jumped back in just

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.960 
doing here is I just jumped back in just
to<00:02:14.700> show<00:02:14.880> you<00:02:14.970> the<00:02:15.090> tapping<00:02:15.450> operation<00:02:15.769> I<00:02:16.970> know

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
to show you the tapping operation I know

I<00:02:18.030> just<00:02:18.150> get<00:02:18.329> a<00:02:18.360> kick<00:02:18.569> out<00:02:18.780> of<00:02:18.810> this<00:02:19.019> it<00:02:19.260> cracks

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
I just get a kick out of this it cracks

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.089 
I just get a kick out of this it cracks
me<00:02:19.650> up<00:02:19.769> to<00:02:19.980> see<00:02:21.230> CNC<00:02:22.230> machine<00:02:22.530> tap<00:02:22.829> and

me up to see CNC machine tap and

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.190 
me up to see CNC machine tap and
actually<00:02:23.519> this<00:02:24.060> is<00:02:24.120> very<00:02:24.269> very<00:02:24.690> conservative

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
actually this is very very conservative

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.930 
actually this is very very conservative
I<00:02:25.500> got<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.739> speeds<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.190> feeds<00:02:26.250> turned<00:02:26.730> down

I got the speeds and feeds turned down

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.509 
I got the speeds and feeds turned down
and<00:02:27.209> it's<00:02:27.329> a<00:02:27.390> soft<00:02:27.630> material<00:02:28.200> like<00:02:28.230> grind<00:02:28.680> but

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
and it's a soft material like grind but

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.330 
and it's a soft material like grind but

rib structure the majority of the rib

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.620 
rib structure the majority of the rib
structure<00:04:26.110> originally<00:04:26.380> was<00:04:26.800> intended<00:04:26.830> to<00:04:27.280> be

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
structure originally was intended to be

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.230 
structure originally was intended to be
the<00:04:28.630> energy<00:04:29.530> director<00:04:30.250> between<00:04:31.000> the<00:04:31.090> two

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
the energy director between the two

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.670 
the energy director between the two
parts<00:04:31.630> and<00:04:32.490> through<00:04:33.490> developing<00:04:34.290> the<00:04:35.290> pilot

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
parts and through developing the pilot

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.740 
parts and through developing the pilot
and<00:04:35.830> pre-production<00:04:36.340> runs<00:04:36.940> we're<00:04:37.480> learning

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
and pre-production runs we're learning

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.430 
and pre-production runs we're learning
that<00:04:39.120> there's<00:04:40.120> too<00:04:40.390> much<00:04:40.570> surface<00:04:40.990> area<00:04:41.230> for

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
that there's too much surface area for

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.770 
that there's too much surface area for
the<00:04:41.560> rib<00:04:42.550> structure<00:04:42.970> contacting<00:04:43.600> so

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
the rib structure contacting so

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.540 
the rib structure contacting so
basically<00:04:44.110> what<00:04:44.350> we're<00:04:44.500> doing<00:04:44.740> here<00:04:45.100> is<00:04:45.280> we're

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
basically what we're doing here is we're

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.110 
basically what we're doing here is we're
machining<00:04:45.970> away<00:04:46.210> portions<00:04:46.630> of<00:04:47.430> the<00:04:48.430> ribs<00:04:48.669> and

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
machining away portions of the ribs and

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.000 
machining away portions of the ribs and
we<00:04:49.660> keep<00:04:49.810> machining<00:04:50.350> more<00:04:50.500> and<00:04:50.620> more<00:04:50.770> away

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
we keep machining more and more away

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.310 
we keep machining more and more away
until<00:04:51.400> then<00:04:52.300> and<00:04:52.450> then<00:04:52.570> go<00:04:52.720> and<00:04:52.870> try<00:04:53.020> to<00:04:53.080> weld

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
until then and then go and try to weld

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.830 
until then and then go and try to weld
it<00:04:53.500> and<00:04:53.740> then<00:04:53.890> once<00:04:54.550> we<00:04:54.760> find<00:04:55.030> the<00:04:55.330> optimum

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
it and then once we find the optimum

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.460 
it and then once we find the optimum
amount<00:04:56.610> we<00:04:57.610> will<00:04:57.820> have<00:04:58.030> the<00:04:59.020> knowledge<00:04:59.200> we

00:04:59.460 --> 00:04:59.470 
amount we will have the knowledge we

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.380 
amount we will have the knowledge we
need<00:04:59.560> to<00:04:59.650> go<00:04:59.800> in<00:04:59.919> and<00:05:00.070> change<00:05:00.370> the<00:05:00.490> tool<00:05:01.150> the

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:01.390 
need to go in and change the tool the

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.930 
need to go in and change the tool the
injection<00:05:01.840> mold<00:05:02.220> to<00:05:03.220> adjust<00:05:03.610> the<00:05:03.730> part

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
injection mold to adjust the part

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.270 
injection mold to adjust the part
accordingly<00:05:04.360> for<00:05:04.570> production<00:05:05.080> and<00:05:05.800> basically

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
accordingly for production and basically

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.680 
accordingly for production and basically
what<00:05:06.370> you're<00:05:06.490> seeing<00:05:06.730> here<00:05:07.090> is<00:05:07.150> you're<00:05:07.450> seeing

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
what you're seeing here is you're seeing

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:09.210 
what you're seeing here is you're seeing
the<00:05:07.900> same<00:05:08.169> thing<00:05:08.500> as<00:05:08.620> you<00:05:08.740> saw<00:05:08.950> in<00:05:09.070> the<00:05:09.190> other

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:09.220 
the same thing as you saw in the other

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:11.100 
the same thing as you saw in the other
part<00:05:09.640> it<00:05:09.850> is<00:05:09.970> actually<00:05:10.360> a<00:05:10.419> different<00:05:10.720> fixture

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
part it is actually a different fixture

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.230 
part it is actually a different fixture
but<00:05:11.380> you<00:05:12.040> know<00:05:12.160> I<00:05:12.190> used<00:05:12.690> one<00:05:13.690> one<00:05:13.990> 1/8<00:05:14.290> inch<00:05:14.560> MDF

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
but you know I used one one 1/8 inch MDF

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.000 
but you know I used one one 1/8 inch MDF
we<00:05:16.240> have<00:05:16.450> Wren<00:05:16.840> board<00:05:17.200> blocks<00:05:17.590> that<00:05:17.890> we

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 
we have Wren board blocks that we

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:22.190 
we have Wren board blocks that we
machined<00:05:18.400> down<00:05:18.640> to<00:05:19.950> provide<00:05:20.950> specific

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.200 
machined down to provide specific

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.080 
machined down to provide specific
reference<00:05:23.200> for<00:05:23.530> the<00:05:23.620> part<00:05:23.890> and<00:05:24.669> what<00:05:24.940> I've

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
reference for the part and what I've

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:26.969 
reference for the part and what I've
done<00:05:25.270> is<00:05:25.479> I've<00:05:25.630> crudely<00:05:25.930> added<00:05:26.500> some<00:05:26.740> blocks

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:26.979 
done is I've crudely added some blocks

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:29.700 
done is I've crudely added some blocks
of<00:05:27.220> MDF<00:05:27.669> onto<00:05:28.090> the<00:05:28.210> rim<00:05:28.419> to<00:05:29.080> make<00:05:29.260> mounting

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
of MDF onto the rim to make mounting

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.150 
of MDF onto the rim to make mounting
points<00:05:30.130> for<00:05:30.460> the<00:05:31.410> steak<00:05:32.410> au<00:05:32.440> clamps<00:05:32.919> that<00:05:33.010> we

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:33.160 
points for the steak au clamps that we

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.480 
points for the steak au clamps that we
used<00:05:33.400> on<00:05:33.640> the<00:05:34.080> fixture<00:05:35.080> yesterday<00:05:35.680> which

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
used on the fixture yesterday which

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.580 
used on the fixture yesterday which
works<00:05:36.760> so<00:05:37.270> so<00:05:37.630> nice<00:05:37.810> it<00:05:38.080> makes<00:05:38.169> it<00:05:38.350> so<00:05:38.470> much

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
works so so nice it makes it so much

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:39.840 
works so so nice it makes it so much
faster<00:05:38.800> because<00:05:39.040> what<00:05:39.310> I<00:05:39.340> had<00:05:39.550> been<00:05:39.700> using

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:39.850 
faster because what I had been using

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:42.659 
faster because what I had been using
before<00:05:40.060> was<00:05:40.630> if<00:05:40.900> you<00:05:40.990> look<00:05:41.169> closely<00:05:41.500> here<00:05:42.010> you

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:42.669 
before was if you look closely here you

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:45.450 
before was if you look closely here you
can<00:05:42.850> see<00:05:43.120> those<00:05:43.750> tapped<00:05:44.080> holes<00:05:44.380> in<00:05:44.650> the<00:05:44.740> top<00:05:44.979> so

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
can see those tapped holes in the top so

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.540 
can see those tapped holes in the top so
I'd<00:05:46.210> screw<00:05:46.630> in<00:05:46.870> a<00:05:47.380> fastener<00:05:47.950> and<00:05:48.070> screw<00:05:48.310> it<00:05:48.430> out

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
I'd screw in a fastener and screw it out

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.450 
I'd screw in a fastener and screw it out
every<00:05:49.090> time<00:05:49.360> well<00:05:49.870> this<00:05:50.260> works<00:05:50.530> just<00:05:50.830> fine<00:05:51.130> for

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:51.460 
every time well this works just fine for

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.219 
every time well this works just fine for
when<00:05:52.000> you're<00:05:52.150> only<00:05:52.270> doing<00:05:52.660> you<00:05:52.870> know<00:05:52.960> half<00:05:53.200> a

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:53.229 
when you're only doing you know half a

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:55.170 
when you're only doing you know half a
dozen<00:05:53.530> or<00:05:53.800> a<00:05:53.830> dozen<00:05:53.890> but<00:05:54.370> I'm<00:05:54.550> gonna<00:05:54.940> have<00:05:55.150> to

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
dozen or a dozen but I'm gonna have to

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.810 
dozen or a dozen but I'm gonna have to
do<00:05:55.360> quite<00:05:55.570> a<00:05:55.690> few<00:05:56.020> here<00:05:56.380> and<00:05:56.560> this<00:05:57.340> will<00:05:57.520> save<00:05:57.790> a

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:57.820 
do quite a few here and this will save a

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.490 
do quite a few here and this will save a
lot<00:05:58.090> of<00:05:58.120> time<00:05:58.390> in<00:05:58.570> addition<00:05:58.990> I've<00:05:59.110> learned<00:05:59.380> a

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500 
lot of time in addition I've learned a

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.770 
lot of time in addition I've learned a
lot<00:05:59.530> with<00:06:00.040> what<00:06:00.760> I<00:06:00.790> can<00:06:01.120> and<00:06:01.270> can't<00:06:01.479> get<00:06:01.630> away

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:01.780 
lot with what I can and can't get away

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.530 
lot with what I can and can't get away
with<00:06:02.190> as<00:06:03.190> far<00:06:03.430> as<00:06:03.580> the<00:06:03.700> actual<00:06:03.880> machining<00:06:04.479> in

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:04.540 
with as far as the actual machining in

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.180 
with as far as the actual machining in
the<00:06:04.630> parts<00:06:04.870> so<00:06:04.960> I'm<00:06:05.050> gonna<00:06:05.200> speed<00:06:05.650> up<00:06:05.680> my

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.190 
the parts so I'm gonna speed up my

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:08.680 
the parts so I'm gonna speed up my
speeds<00:06:07.000> and<00:06:07.120> feeds<00:06:07.180> to<00:06:07.540> see<00:06:07.720> if<00:06:07.810> I<00:06:07.930> can<00:06:08.110> get

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:08.690 
speeds and feeds to see if I can get

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:11.170 
speeds and feeds to see if I can get
cut<00:06:09.380> my<00:06:09.500> time<00:06:09.710> in<00:06:09.890> half<00:06:10.070> so<00:06:10.460> that's<00:06:10.880> about<00:06:11.030> it

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:11.180 
cut my time in half so that's about it
