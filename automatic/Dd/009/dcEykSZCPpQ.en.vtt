 I am the living and as you can see in 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.420
 screen we are in clíver bots 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.190
 Good for not knowing that 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.470
 I think there will be few people who do not know what 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.869
 what is this but well this is not a 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:18.820
 video game this is a bot with which 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:21.759
 can you chat ballet you can keep 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.659
 a conversation with him and good the 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:24.519
 truth is that you asked me 

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:26.169
 There was a lot of comments 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:27.880
 a long time ago but the clear me 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:30.339
 I'm saving the games minus point and 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.170
 when I see the moment then I play them 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:34.300
 I really wanted to talk to kléber bot 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:36.100
 because I have a goal and that I am going to 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.050
 count now actually before I wanted to 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.850
 tell you that if you like this type of 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.770
 videos and you like to make videos with 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.660
 kléber bot well you know that you have to 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.250
 hit like if I see many more likes 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.590
 forward I will do more and this works like this 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.180

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:57.490
 no videos or that game or whatever in 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:00.130
