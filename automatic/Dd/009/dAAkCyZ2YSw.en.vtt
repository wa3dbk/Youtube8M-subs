00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.210
 hello dear friends today 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:17.380
 our agenda is so small 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:20.630
 strange but no less important question 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:23.050
 the question is related to the children and ask 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:26.119
 how true is the us and in canada 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.230
 advocates a law that talks about 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:32.860
 that up to a certain 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:36.020
 ages children don't get any names and 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:40.040
 they are considered it until they grow up and 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.989
 they themselves do not determine who they are in their own way 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.570
 semi there and so on all the sensations 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.040
 how true or false it is 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:50.179
 so legitimate do they talk about it 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:53.390
 can I say anything at all 

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:56.050
 this never heard anything that is 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:00.440
 here's an introduction to this issue 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:03.379
 it was said about what they say in Canada 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.239
 and in the us it is very, very strong 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.520
 pedal with great emotions with 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.560
 great moods there so on but 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.730
 I can say that here I am a man who 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:19.310
 I 've been constantly listening for the past four years 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:20.960
 watching all the news that 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.960
 generally in Canada go out and concern 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.960
 canada can say anything to this 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:30.049
 the topic we do not say anything to this 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.840
 the topic we have not pedal spring all that 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:33.880
 what do you say 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.659
 about this you can safely share 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:40.560
 at 15 in canada as i have said before 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:44.590
 in one of seen in canada very 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:47.079
 Anxious about developing tolerance 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.060
 in children in canada 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:53.409
 there are a bunch of programs that 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:59.500
 directed against bullying when people 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:02:01.750
 there children tease for something players for 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.959
 overweight for some kind of inadequate 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.579
 behavior there is something else but in 

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:10.479
 Canada, again, there are a lot of programs 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:12.280
 which are aimed at 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.530
 talk about what if you have there 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.560
 other sexual orientation that i 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:21.720
 principle, too, nothing fatal that 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:24.120
 All these fashionable with this can live and 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.450
 about this regularly come there 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.550
 on party flyer 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:32.080
 minorities they are stories of their lives 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:35.080
 there are all sorts of different 5 same parades 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.330
 which usually doesn't really have 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.590
 nothing to do with propaganda at home 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:43.440
 sexual filthy 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:46.070
 often issued in mass media 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.350
 information country to shade 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:51.900
 it's just holidays it's a reason for people 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.010
 once again get together once again 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.830
 go mad there 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.710
 have fun it is really easy 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:01.050
 correctly another thing that the main 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.150
 protagonist there is sexual 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:07.020
 minority 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:10.850
 but again in canada specifically in canada 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.850
 I took it very calmly 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.790
 by and large nobody is 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.700
 draw attention people live them 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.819
 Quarters quietly deal with their 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.849
 affairs 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:26.450
 fingers are shown on the handle 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:27.310
 there kissing still doing it another 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.600
 story 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:34.920
 going back to the question of what 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:36.440
 In Canada and the United States, the law is still 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.190
 time 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:42.770
 there are very strong family values 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:45.470
 be that as it may, though 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:48.410
 said our propagandize start 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:51.370
 promoted and popularized to 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.370
 producing 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:58.670
 if joyful attitude why is it there 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:01.079
 and the Carpathians despite all this Canada 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.870
 very very very family country plan 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:04.860
 family goal and accordingly no 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.250
 normal parent 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:09.769
 a normal person can allow 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.519
 child a certain amount of time 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:14.090
 will be without a name 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:16.680
 the more there is a law that 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:22.860
 prescribes to give the child them for 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:24.930
 helped many there either 30-60 days 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.060
 watch the civil code but when not 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.850
 there was before there was a clear law which 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.160
 says that right after birth 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:33.930
 the child must get exactly 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.060
 accordingly if parents cannot 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:39.570
 decide on a name 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:42.930
 when to give birth and make it a cake organ with 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:45.020
 salute ward then testik 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.650
 there is a direct contradiction between 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.289
 existing acting 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:52.470
 legislation and topics that he was 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:54.260
 very familiar adjustable forge 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.470
 west 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.060
 respectively 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.010
 do not pay attention to it all 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.880
 normal especially if we are talking about 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:06.640
 quebec choice looking at what it is 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:09.940
 province is catholic but to only here 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:12.880
 most non-practitioners 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:15.520
 there rites of hand questions such as 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.560
 give the child as quickly as possible gay and 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:20.380
 as soon as possible baby baptize there 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:22.390
 so on here it is respected quaranta 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:24.100
 that they no one gets into the soul does not speak 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:28.030
 that you should go to church 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:30.310
 artists what to do then again 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.290
 repeated that canada is this country of family 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.720
 values ​​in canada i have many times 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:36.910
 talked about svon categories 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.860
 live flashy super in my opinion and 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:41.290
 states to do everything to 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:45.680
 this category was now very good 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:49.430
 are they kids or is this a review 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:52.729
 they have the green light everywhere and from the girl 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:56.570
 intently good relationship and 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:59.169
 all the conditions for formal and 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:02.770
 comfortable and normal life 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:06.680

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:10.970
