00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
 hello to all the pilots and welcome 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:04.710
 in it dangerous for a video that 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.480
 is called five minutes to understand 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.980
 why my reputation is falling then 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.250
 since version 1.3 elite in the 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.630
 back 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.330
 there are enough of you to ask 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.769
 why your reputation 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.570
 while you have done nothing wrong 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.130
 automatically drops 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.529
 a few minutes after starting 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.990
 your party this is the case here we see that 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.670
 reputation within the empire is 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.230
 going down but she's 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.580
 also falling within 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.890
 all the breath actions that have 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.029
 lent allegiance to the year worse and well 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.070
 it's normal since frontier 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.290
 development decided from version 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.590
 1.3 elite in the day this game for 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.890
 the reputation very bad and very 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.510
 good 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.430
 there was going to be a slip 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.890
 natural and automatic of the 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.660
 reputation for reminder you know that 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.789
 in the ide in the red there are five 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.820
 levels of neutral reputation that is the 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:53.579
 level with which we start friendly and 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.840
 allies that is the best rate of the 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.719
 better reputation we can have 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.890
 and unfriendly and hostile who is the stone 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.420
 reputation we can have 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.430
 and good to prevent players 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.710
 remain stuck with a reputation at 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.930
 style with the main factions and 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.180
 effect of consequences on 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.549
 subsections that have lent allegiance 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.020
 and well borders decided that of 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.360
 natural and automatic way 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.680
 we went with the time spent from hostile 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.740
 to a friendly which is still 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.470
 less impacting is the same when we 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.750
 is allied with a main faction 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.200
 little by little we will go down 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.420
 to become simply friendly 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.710
 so it only concerns the factions 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.030
 main 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.079
 it's a very important notion to 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.600
 understand that is to say that it does not 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.540
 concerns that the Federation lempire and 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.659
 the alliance in this case I suffered a 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:47.040
 ally in my example with all 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:49.710
 blows actions of this station this is 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.990
 marked against I am friendly with the 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.970
 empire that is to say we understand that we 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.399
 can be alloyed with sub faction 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.189
 it's a notion of local hero who 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:02.579
 was integrated but remained friendly 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:05.159
 with the dominant faction if I become 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.350
 allied with the dominant faction and well 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.450
 for a time to become friendly again 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.099
 I will be allied with all the sub 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.480
 faction dependent on this faction 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:16.190
 main 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.270
 I hope this little explanation is going 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.990
 to help you understand why 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:23.480
 you are with down arrows 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.980
 then you did not do anything wrong in 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.830
 the elite in the red game since the 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:31.040
 version 1.3 know that to finish if I 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.360
 wants to counteract this drop in my 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.560
 reputation with the faction 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.940
 principal who is the empire 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.250
 well I have to fill 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.380
 resignation or that I 'm trading I 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.540
 resells exploration data or that 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.450
 I sell premium hunting bonuses 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:49.090
 1 on this I tell you very soon 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.090
 have fun there be careful
