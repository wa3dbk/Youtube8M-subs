 this video is sponsored by rose barry 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.279
 the robe the reviews 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:16.179
 but please favor that makes you so mean 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:54.070
 there facebook twitter and youtube looks 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.290
 They recommended that I do not go so much 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.870
 to the guataca type show because it's more 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.570
 comedy I am other things not but it is 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.839
 inevitable that I a comedian 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.910
 frustrated have to go to what he likes 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:11.110
 that is our passion and that kind of 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:12.970
 video blog are you all funny today 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.670
 I want to talk to you about something that I thought 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:21.400
 really very interesting that is about 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:25.930
 the good moon exactly would be the the 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:27.550
 trip the supposed trip that was made to 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.210
 Moon 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:34.500
 in the last century good indeed from 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.970
 and he has long been considered this 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.830
 possibility of a trip to the student 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:43.190
 even july verne 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.680
 presented in his work of the moon land 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.700
 of 1875 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.700
 a possible trip 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:55.329
 good also in those old movies 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:58.299
 a representation of georges was put 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:02:01.110
 méliès the famous moon that has nailed 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:03.720
 in the right eye of the rocket 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.490
 that he was sitting in 1902 on the 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.500
 man's arrival to the satellite the 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.830
 satellite that is the light in your movie 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:14.130
 trip to the moon good and it turns out very 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:17.660
 curious that july verne and these others are 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.660
 called have I been able to 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:25.530
 prophesy in some way what does 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:27.060
 to produce in the following years with 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.600
 a big difference of time with this 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:34.770
 when you did not even think about things 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:37.560
 like the air force and those things 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.630
 that are now very normal, not like them 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.640
 they could think clearly it's normal that 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:45.660
 july verne for example he did many 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:48.000
 novels about mysteries and things that 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.910
 now I know that in that time if the 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.459
 more science fiction are now possible and 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:57.030
 It is very curious how he could know 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:59.270
 that's good some say some are 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.870
 rumors that spread by which 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:06.240
 could or have come from the future or have 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.070
 had contact with extraterrestrials the 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.770
 two possibilities are really very 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:13.480
 interesting because it would mean that 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:16.269
 July and green was not common 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.129
 and not based on your imagination the 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:22.019
 novels that he made but he had 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:25.360
 evidence that it was good 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:28.810
 we focused more on the trip that occurred 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.760
 to the moon they have run in many things 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.180
 a lot of mysticism that's why it's a 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:37.060
 mount good I want to introduce you 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:41.890
 well I read a book called the earth 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:44.500
 it is hollow where it is explained that this 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.849
 trip to the moon if it was made but the 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.829
 statesmen were not the ones who arrived 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:49.720
 first but the Russians were the 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:51.340
 soviets to the moon race the 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:52.780
 Soviets came first 10 too 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.879
 you can show the web there is a 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.470
 information when the game is loaded 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:58.299
 about these conspiracy things in 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.239
 the crystal this conspiracy that maybe 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:03.970
 to the greatest that can be presented about 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:05.829
 the lunar and good race in this book 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.109
 I also said that the said can 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:09.879
 find that the Soviets were the 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:12.160
 first that arrived well but that 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:13.550
 they found the error that the 

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.580
 Soviet was that 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:18.889
 arrived, let's give an example in the 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:21.019
 new york of the moon 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:23.689
 the place where the elders are produced 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:26.719
 phenomena serious error because clearly 

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:29.479
 if here it was inhabited there were beings 

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:33.129
 inhabiting the moon they were going to intervene and what 

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:36.340
 they did in the book he explained that he 

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:40.069
 made a transmission in the 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:43.069
 Russian astronauts invited to see 

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:45.409
 robots as well as you hear a kind 

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:48.349
 of robotic spider that attacked them and died 

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:50.120
 one of them the Soviets in their 

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:53.000
 secrecy that both characterizes them and 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.889
 they preferred to close today they said they have 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.930
 produced many accidents and that 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:59.180
 they were going to continue with the race no area 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:02.810
 the Americans for their part were 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:04.969
 something more astute decided to arrive in 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.289
 a kind of lunar desert as well 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:07.969
 say it a place where the deletion 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:10.200
 many phenomena was somewhat calmer 

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:13.380
 that's why they could record it 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:15.510
 and many problems nothing happened in the 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:18.690
 good case that this was taken as 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:21.960
 true and not that if it were a montage but 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:24.390
 you have to remember something because after the 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:27.870
 lunar journey of that time we have 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:30.920
 continued to investigate by sending people to the 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:33.500
 moon and only probes 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:35.540
 going to other sides when the moon is what 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.010
 that matters because it is the most 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:40.310
 close that we have new the body 

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:41.630
 celestial closest mars venus and the 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:42.950
 others are too far away to 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:46.700
 conversing the student to the land that his 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:51.440
 own satellite good about this from that 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:54.340
 has life in 1835 in a newspaper in the 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.830
 that are enough for us 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:59.620
 English astronomer named jon cryer the 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:02.120
 which ensured that with a telescope there was 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.430
 seen beings on the moon 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.040
 it was a montage a big farce but the 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:07.990
 newspaper sold 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:11.890
 that means that people really 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:13.400
 you want there to be life on the moon good not 

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:17.449
 It can 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:20.780
 and signed on this in antiquity already 

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:24.050
 it has been seen that the astronomers of these 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:26.090
 ancient civilizations already believed that the 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:29.680
 moon was something very special and hid 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:32.900
 many mysteries good 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:35.389
 we know that the student is produced a 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.880
 a lot of phenomena that do not have 

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:39.710
 explanation as are lights as they are 

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:42.500
 structures that have nothing what 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:44.479
 natural and that in a moment you observe and 

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.850
 then when they return to look for 

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:48.199
 they are no longer there as they are 

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:52.729
 can explain this have also seen 

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:56.050
 even vehicles that move around 

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:58.990
 the lunar surface but what 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:01.360
 they are not easy to find good at 

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:02.919
 true all that is a great mystery and it 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:06.610
 you can find a lot of information 

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:10.420
 about this either the real one or not 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:16.000
 which is at your discretion 

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:19.510
 There has been talk of good 

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.100
 is what I can say now you as 

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:23.140
 I always say this channel for you so 

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:26.380
 that you have the last word to 

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:29.950
 you have left to decide how real 

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:35.080
 can this be the moon can hide 

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:37.249
 phenomena or not and I think it 's the mystery 

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:41.599
 what is it with a moon 

00:07:37.249 --> 00:07:46.239
 pinging where the webmaster response 

00:07:41.599 --> 00:07:46.239
 is described now
