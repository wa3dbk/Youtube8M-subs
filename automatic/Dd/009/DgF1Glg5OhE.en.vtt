actually get to the pattern there's two
notes<00:03:14.790> that<00:03:14.939> start<00:03:15.390> it<00:03:15.540> so<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.500> two<00:03:16.650> notes

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
notes that start it so the two notes

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.839 
notes that start it so the two notes
that<00:03:16.980> start<00:03:17.220> it<00:03:17.340> or<00:03:17.459> 8<00:03:17.700> and<00:03:17.970> 10<00:03:18.269> on<00:03:18.510> the<00:03:18.629> low<00:03:18.780> E

00:03:19.839 --> 00:03:19.849 
that start it or 8 and 10 on the low E

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:22.190 
that start it or 8 and 10 on the low E
alright<00:03:20.849> so<00:03:21.450> those<00:03:21.569> are<00:03:21.750> just<00:03:21.780> out<00:03:21.989> of<00:03:22.019> nowhere

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
alright so those are just out of nowhere

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.500 
alright so those are just out of nowhere
just<00:03:22.500> down<00:03:22.680> up<00:03:22.859> and<00:03:23.069> now<00:03:23.670> we<00:03:23.730> have<00:03:24.090> a<00:03:24.120> pattern

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
just down up and now we have a pattern

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.720 
just down up and now we have a pattern
that<00:03:24.870> starts<00:03:25.319> which<00:03:25.950> the<00:03:26.250> first<00:03:26.459> one<00:03:26.609> is<00:03:26.730> this

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
that starts which the first one is this

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.660 
that starts which the first one is this
alright<00:03:29.730> so<00:03:29.790> what<00:03:30.120> that<00:03:30.239> is<00:03:30.480> is<00:03:30.510> 12<00:03:31.079> on<00:03:31.260> the

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
alright so what that is is 12 on the

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.530 
alright so what that is is 12 on the
straight<00:03:32.670> alpha<00:03:32.819> picking<00:03:33.150> start<00:03:33.359> with<00:03:33.480> the

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
straight alpha picking start with the

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.339 
straight alpha picking start with the
down<00:03:33.689> stroke<00:03:33.989> of<00:03:34.049> 12<00:03:34.379> on<00:03:34.560> the<00:03:34.620> low<00:03:34.739> E<00:03:34.769> to<00:03:35.730> 10

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:36.349 
down stroke of 12 on the low E to 10

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:39.129 
down stroke of 12 on the low E to 10
back<00:03:37.349> to<00:03:37.470> 12

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:39.139 
back to 12

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:41.869 
back to 12
Paul<00:03:40.139> muted<00:03:40.500> by<00:03:40.560> the<00:03:40.620> way<00:03:40.829> and<00:03:41.099> then<00:03:41.280> to<00:03:41.609> 9th

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:41.879 
Paul muted by the way and then to 9th

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:51.390 
Paul muted by the way and then to 9th
fret<00:03:43.579> 9<00:03:44.579> 10<00:03:45.239> 12<00:03:45.629> on<00:03:46.049> that<00:03:46.230> way<00:03:46.919> this

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.420 

so<00:03:52.400> what<00:03:52.610> I<00:03:52.640> mean<00:03:52.700> that<00:03:52.850> this<00:03:53.060> is<00:03:53.209> a<00:03:53.240> pattern<00:03:53.750> is

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
so what I mean that this is a pattern is

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.370 
so what I mean that this is a pattern is
those<00:03:55.430> exact<00:03:55.850> same<00:03:55.880> two<00:03:56.360> basically<00:03:57.110> three

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
those exact same two basically three

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.940 
those exact same two basically three
notes<00:03:57.620> here<00:03:58.330> one<00:03:59.330> descending<00:04:00.110> back<00:04:00.470> up<00:04:00.650> and

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
notes here one descending back up and

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.860 
notes here one descending back up and
then<00:04:01.250> playing<00:04:02.060> three<00:04:02.270> notes<00:04:02.300> on<00:04:02.569> the<00:04:02.630> next

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
then playing three notes on the next

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.530 
then playing three notes on the next
string<00:04:03.050> that's<00:04:03.650> the<00:04:03.920> pattern<00:04:04.310> so<00:04:05.000> down<00:04:05.270> up

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
string that's the pattern so down up

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.380 
string that's the pattern so down up
down<00:04:05.900> up<00:04:06.200> down<00:04:06.260> up<00:04:06.800> and<00:04:07.130> now<00:04:08.090> we're<00:04:08.239> going<00:04:08.330> to

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
down up down up and now we're going to

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.090 
down up down up and now we're going to
do<00:04:08.480> that<00:04:08.600> exact<00:04:08.900> same<00:04:09.080> pattern<00:04:09.380> except<00:04:09.950> we're

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.100 
do that exact same pattern except we're

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:11.740 
do that exact same pattern except we're
going<00:04:10.220> to<00:04:10.280> do<00:04:10.400> it<00:04:10.580> we're<00:04:10.970> going<00:04:11.090> to<00:04:11.150> move<00:04:11.300> up<00:04:11.480> to

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
going to do it we're going to move up to

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.140 
going to do it we're going to move up to
the<00:04:12.140> fourteenth<00:04:12.650> fret<00:04:12.800> on<00:04:12.890> the<00:04:12.980> a<00:04:13.069> so<00:04:13.910> the

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
the fourteenth fret on the a so the

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.910 
the fourteenth fret on the a so the
first<00:04:14.180> three<00:04:14.569> notes<00:04:14.780> that<00:04:14.930> are<00:04:15.080> on<00:04:15.230> the<00:04:15.440> first

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
first three notes that are on the first

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.830 
first three notes that are on the first
string<00:04:16.220> are<00:04:16.400> going<00:04:16.519> to<00:04:16.579> be<00:04:16.700> fourteen<00:04:17.419> twelve

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
string are going to be fourteen twelve

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.319 
string are going to be fourteen twelve
fourteen<00:04:18.440> and<00:04:18.680> the<00:04:19.190> three<00:04:19.370> notes<00:04:19.549> on<00:04:19.669> the<00:04:19.760> next

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
fourteen and the three notes on the next

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:24.600 
fourteen and the three notes on the next
string<00:04:20.510> up<00:04:20.630> we're<00:04:20.780> going<00:04:20.870> to<00:04:20.930> be<00:04:21.049> 10<00:04:21.470> 12<00:04:22.160> and<00:04:22.690> 14

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
string up we're going to be 10 12 and 14

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.830 
string up we're going to be 10 12 and 14
so<00:04:25.610> you<00:04:25.700> see<00:04:25.820> how<00:04:25.910> it's<00:04:26.150> different<00:04:26.510> fingers

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
so you see how it's different fingers

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.550 
so you see how it's different fingers
any<00:04:27.260> different<00:04:27.650> notes<00:04:28.550> but<00:04:28.940> the<00:04:29.030> same<00:04:29.240> pattern

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.440 

and<00:04:33.560> then<00:04:33.650> we'll<00:04:33.770> continue<00:04:33.950> it<00:04:34.280> one<00:04:34.520> more<00:04:34.760> move

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
and then we'll continue it one more move

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.510 
and then we'll continue it one more move
that<00:04:35.720> now<00:04:35.930> up<00:04:36.169> you<00:04:36.410> have<00:04:36.500> to<00:04:36.590> 14th<00:04:36.950> fret<00:04:37.130> with

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
that now up you have to 14th fret with

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.730 
that now up you have to 14th fret with
your<00:04:37.640> little<00:04:38.030> finger<00:04:38.360> on<00:04:38.390> the<00:04:38.660> D<00:04:39.260> string<00:04:39.290> move

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
your little finger on the D string move

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.300 
your little finger on the D string move
it<00:04:39.830> up<00:04:39.919> to<00:04:39.950> the<00:04:40.100> 16th<00:04:40.520> fret<00:04:41.740> and<00:04:42.740> it's<00:04:42.890> exactly

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
it up to the 16th fret and it's exactly

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:45.250 
it up to the 16th fret and it's exactly
like

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
like

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.240 
like
exactly<00:04:46.260> like<00:04:46.380> you<00:04:46.470> did<00:04:46.620> before<00:04:46.680> same

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
exactly like you did before same

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.440 
exactly like you did before same
fingerings<00:04:47.700> and<00:04:47.850> everything<00:04:48.890> 16<00:04:49.890> 14<00:04:50.310> 16<00:04:50.850> to<00:04:51.090> 12

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
fingerings and everything 16 14 16 to 12

00:04:51.450 --> 00:05:03.140 
fingerings and everything 16 14 16 to 12
14<00:04:52.110> 16<00:04:52.440> on<00:04:53.130> G<00:04:53.870> you<00:04:54.870> can<00:04:54.930> see<00:04:58.640> it<00:04:59.640> all<00:04:59.730> together
