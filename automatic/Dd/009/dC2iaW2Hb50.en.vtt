 Look at the goal, this is swapping. 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.230
 experiences with strong brand names 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.280

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:38.290

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.030
 day to day are the success stories of 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.600

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:55.659
 success is a meeting of this segment 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:01:00.159
 I think this is very important and the focus is 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:01:04.089
 this is information is update know is 

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:07.119
 show how these brands today are 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.680
 positioning in the current scenario as 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:09.340
 that the idea came to bring Pedro 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.770
 Lorena 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.470
 Look, Pedro Lourenço is a great name. 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:18.330
 that we have today and recognized 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:21.720

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:25.040
 of rabbit glory and reinaldo lourenço 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:30.000
 So we wanted to bring the new 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:33.480

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.550
 all this generation of young people from Brazil 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:39.000
 young people with a desire to make fashion 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:44.700
 Brazil that we have more is to tell the 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:47.250
 his experience he was stylist 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.360
 of Brazilian visibility in the 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.880
 outdoor 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.000
 Pedro started early at age 12 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.760
 already has 10 only of career in the iso pedro if 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.050
 I actually started at 12 years old São Paulo 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.880
 fashion week in the first parade to 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.400
 second row in my mother glory rabbit 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.240
 the brand was called carlota flame joaquina 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.950
 exist 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.950
 soon after I started a series of 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:11.070
 exercises of my own brand between 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.050
 15 and 17 years old, some of your 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.870
 parents grandson the mother glory with him has a 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.750
 The pain panel talks a little about the influence 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.990
 them in his later career is organic 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.480
 something in the beginning you will find limiting 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:27.150
 the points that were actually the most 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.060
 inclusion in a world can not require 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:33.300
 in the 1990s while many students who 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.610
 they graduated did not live long ago 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.140
 this fashion technique I lived 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.940
 intensely with my parents and the 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.519
 paris paris 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.290
 Japanese designers who do not 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:44.910
 influenced the fashion in the time I did not have 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.910
 much contact with 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.010
 this universe of this greater influence 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.570
 Did you even tell us about your 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.000
 career abroad, how was the 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:57.000
 construction was something that came naturally or 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.460
 you always looked for is actually in the 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.980
 true since I'm 10 years old. 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:05.550
 age when someone mug so here it is 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:09.360
 all that charisma 19 and was what 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:12.780
 It happened that I did not even speak anymore 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:17.490
 You do not have to leave because it happened. 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.330
 It's organically I moved in 2008 to 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.420
 Paris 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.800
 I started to want contacts and a 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:26.600
 networking and with the help of my friend 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:29.670
 I ended up joining this guy. 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.900
 process on the standing balls and how it was 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.610
 How long have you been participating? 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.360
 paris fashion week two years ago 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:38.280
 and a half and with that universe how 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.140
 as it leads to a little of the culture at 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.370
 culture you have here in your 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.650
 essence there 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:47.010
 in fact something abstract to us talking 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.480
 of a globalized world where I think 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.950
 you no longer have a point of view 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.010
 regional service in fact a universal service 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:56.840
 and paris the fashion capital then watched 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:59.690
 to abstract blackmail and it is actually 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.370
 inherent a point of view 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.580
 Brazil is linked to the influences 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.110
 of my job but it is not something that is glaring 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.850
 after once who wins Brazil and another 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.730
 of Patagonia if it does not have a 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.860
 rule that you intend to go back to 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.020
 fashion week that freedom is true 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.180
 makes presentations here focused 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:20.360
 to the press from time to time some 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:22.970
 towards the consumer 

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:24.560
 in fact an idea that is and never 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.670
 will be far from here a market so 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.620
 important 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:30.470
 even because my country but actually the 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.870
 idea is that these presentations in January 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.610
 in contact with this and that market 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.920
 but the main ones are international 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.110
 even more so inspires you asked 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.240
 when you think of a collection what 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.130
 first on what you think 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.720
 I do not think there is a rule that the 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:48.200
 grace to have a creative head you 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:50.180
 never stick to a pattern then 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.700
 but inspires me, there is no rule that was 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:56.570
 the more unusual you said our this 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:58.700
 It inspired me to so many things, it's already I think 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:01.310
 that is not unusual in fact is also 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.960
 you do not have a probe and marche I 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.360
 had to come there personally to be 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:07.820
 visited , I think there are 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.130
 true breaks in the aesthetic pattern that 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:12.080
 you have on your burden and knowledge 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:15.169
 so I think it depends on a trip to 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:19.220
 travel can be very liberating 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:21.620
 and bring new visions like you. 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:23.150
 sets your note to memory and truth 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.340
 a contemporary woman 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:27.560
 the luxurious like classic but like 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.470
 a classic with a new vision is very 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:33.080
 digital she is a global woman 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:35.030
 Thank you for your participation here at 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:39.020
 hype we were very happy in 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:40.040
 make the third blocks of super radio 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:42.260
 look that 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:44.900
 I love the 9 shirt but not those times. 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:46.850
 a lot is too deep, lady is very 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:49.220
 I do not like it very much. 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:52.390
 dick but calmer but ball 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.390
 of them quite cloudy
