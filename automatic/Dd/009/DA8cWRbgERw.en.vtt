 Hello and welcome to yours 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.529
 steel perfect sharpness perfect light 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.810
 perfect magnification that is 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.060
 room conditions for every dentist though 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.529
 then do not see her in her job 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.110
 you in the truest sense of the word in the 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.270

 rand the homeless glasses are in there 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.480
 two variants as tl with fixed 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.670
 built-in eyepiece or as flip off at 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.220
 The flip can have the eyepieces 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.720
 be changed so that several 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.690
 Doctors use the same glasses 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.820
 the ttl can be personalized on the 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.799
 Eye distance has been adjusted in 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.360
 practice proves your toothbrush 

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:56.729
 I do not want to lend them either 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.519
 We have weight in the design of the glasses 

00:00:56.729 --> 00:01:01.710
 and size of the victim minimizes them 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:04.619

 can wear for many hours for the 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.219
 has daily work with magnification 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:17.219
 the 27-fold magnification proved itself 

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:19.829
 the magnification is just as big as that 

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:22.320
 the complete field of vision the jaw 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:25.530
 covering the depth of field is so good 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:30.840
 that can be seen from the front to the 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:33.630
 molar all teeth sharp see that 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.700
 Quality of the lens is crucial to us 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.829
 use as fresh lentils highest 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.590
 optical quality they are not 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.820
 spherical but shaped as a fetish 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.640
 this creates the highest 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.960
 Picture quality and maximum rent 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.549
 r 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.560
 so she relaxes in a loupe 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.729
 and work ergonomically 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.080
 you have the right working distance 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.930
 choose 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.540
 at a normal title glasses can 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.480
 they will never change that again when 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.120
 optics of orange dental you can over 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.250
 the vario gives the working distance 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:08.240
 subsequently enlarge by 5 cm or 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:11.280

 noticed 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.890
 The eyepieces are flattened when they are 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.230
 So do not have to look up 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.300

 glasses are of course his weight 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.730
 decisively weigh our eyepieces 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:34.560
 only eleven grams 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:36.540

 sympathetic ergo fantastic good
