edged on all sides over particleboard

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.670 
edged on all sides over particleboard
actually<00:01:50.230> they're<00:01:50.380> using<00:01:50.410> a<00:01:50.770> MTF<00:01:51.220> a<00:01:51.580> slightly

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
actually they're using a MTF a slightly

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.620 
actually they're using a MTF a slightly
harder<00:01:53.680> version<00:01:54.250> of<00:01:54.340> particle<00:01:54.760> board<00:01:54.940> it<00:01:55.360> just

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
harder version of particle board it just

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.240 
harder version of particle board it just
means<00:01:55.840> the<00:01:55.990> particle<00:01:56.410> boards<00:01:56.680> are<00:01:56.830> the

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
means the particle boards are the

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.370 
means the particle boards are the
particles<00:01:57.790> are<00:01:57.910> smaller<00:01:58.210> and<00:01:58.480> is<00:01:58.960> a<00:01:58.990> bit<00:01:59.200> more

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
particles are smaller and is a bit more
