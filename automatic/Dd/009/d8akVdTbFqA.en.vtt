00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
got this book here a lot of good

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.300 
got this book here a lot of good
information<00:00:13.769> but<00:00:18.380> I<00:00:19.380> want<00:00:19.619> to<00:00:19.710> try<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:19.949> do<00:00:20.160> the

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
information but I want to try to do the

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:27.510 
information but I want to try to do the
Rose

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:27.520 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.350 

it<00:00:28.520> was<00:00:28.640> pretty<00:00:28.910> good<00:00:29.120> detail<00:00:30.910> next<00:00:31.910> page<00:00:32.090> also

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
it was pretty good detail next page also

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:42.700 
it was pretty good detail next page also
shows<00:00:32.930> this<00:00:33.890> is<00:00:34.160> the<00:00:34.550> types<00:00:35.090> of<00:00:35.300> wood

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.800 

so<00:00:43.310> these<00:00:43.640> will<00:00:43.820> be<00:00:43.940> different<00:00:44.060> types<00:00:44.450> of<00:00:44.600> wood

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:44.810 
so these will be different types of wood

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.310 
so these will be different types of wood
or<00:00:45.170> darker<00:00:45.680> I<00:00:45.830> should<00:00:46.070> say<00:00:46.220> darker<00:00:47.320> Western

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
or darker I should say darker Western

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.590 
or darker I should say darker Western

your<00:00:58.970> darkest<00:00:59.480> is<00:00:59.720> your<00:00:59.989> highest<00:01:00.230> in<00:01:00.790> this

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:01.790 
your darkest is your highest in this

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.369 
your darkest is your highest in this
case<00:01:02.059> I<00:01:02.330> believe<00:01:02.390> that's<00:01:03.080> raising

case I believe that's raising

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:09.340 
case I believe that's raising
three-eighths<00:01:04.100> off<00:01:05.710> the<00:01:07.570> normal<00:01:08.570> drop<00:01:09.170> an

eighth drop another eighth these will be
dropped<00:01:13.119> quarter<00:01:17.770> and<00:01:18.770> that's<00:01:19.190> what<00:01:19.399> I<00:01:19.430> have

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
dropped quarter and that's what I have

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.660 
dropped quarter and that's what I have
here<00:01:21.640> trying<00:01:22.640> to<00:01:22.670> look<00:01:22.820> straight<00:01:23.090> down<00:01:23.149> on<00:01:23.600> it

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
here trying to look straight down on it

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:31.180 
here trying to look straight down on it
see<00:01:25.670> if<00:01:25.790> we<00:01:25.910> can<00:01:26.030> see<00:01:26.210> the<00:01:26.360> gaps<00:01:27.009> very<00:01:28.009> few<00:01:30.190> very

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
see if we can see the gaps very few very

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:38.529 
see if we can see the gaps very few very
few<00:01:31.369> gaps

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:38.539 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:40.719 

look<00:01:39.110> at<00:01:39.229> the<00:01:39.350> elevation<00:01:39.829> you'll<00:01:40.399> be<00:01:40.520> able<00:01:40.579> to

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:40.729 
look at the elevation you'll be able to

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.020 
look at the elevation you'll be able to
see<00:01:40.850> the<00:01:41.000> elevation<00:01:41.570> I<00:01:41.689> would<00:01:41.840> imagine<00:01:43.030> I'm

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
see the elevation I would imagine I'm

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.330 
see the elevation I would imagine I'm
getting<00:01:44.360> to<00:01:44.450> within<00:01:44.750> like<00:01:44.990> 3/8<00:01:45.590> at<00:01:46.130> the

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
getting to within like 3/8 at the

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:54.880 
getting to within like 3/8 at the
outside<00:01:46.939> edge<00:01:47.270> and<00:01:52.780> the<00:01:53.780> center<00:01:53.810> is<00:01:54.439> probably

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
outside edge and the center is probably

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.289 
outside edge and the center is probably
a<00:01:54.950> good<00:01:56.409> half<00:01:57.409> inch<00:01:57.710> 5/8<00:01:58.399> higher<00:01:58.700> than<00:01:59.179> the

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
a good half inch 5/8 higher than the

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:11.820 
a good half inch 5/8 higher than the
outside<00:01:59.750> edge

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.330 

I<00:02:11.920> started<00:02:12.850> I<00:02:13.030> drew<00:02:13.420> it<00:02:13.630> I<00:02:13.810> drew<00:02:14.380> it<00:02:14.410> out<00:02:14.650> first

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
I started I drew it I drew it out first

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:25.440 
I started I drew it I drew it out first

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
and then I use tracing paper try to get

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:34.330 
and then I use tracing paper try to get
all<00:02:25.570> the<00:02:25.720> grains<00:02:27.270> different<00:02:28.270> grains

in<00:04:31.590> real<00:04:31.800> handy<00:04:31.830> for<00:04:32.460> rolling<00:04:33.470> turn<00:04:34.470> that<00:04:34.680> on<00:04:34.920> I

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
in real handy for rolling turn that on I

00:04:34.950 --> 00:05:08.050 
in real handy for rolling turn that on I
just<00:04:35.310> roll

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.880
