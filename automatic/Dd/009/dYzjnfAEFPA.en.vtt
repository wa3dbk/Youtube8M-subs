that you can fully round with in the

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:04.770 
that you can fully round with in the
tool<00:01:03.219> properties<00:01:03.699> panel<00:01:03.940> for<00:01:04.330> the<00:01:04.420> pencil

tool properties panel for the pencil

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.870 
tool properties panel for the pencil
tool<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:07.210> first<00:01:07.480> being<00:01:07.720> the<00:01:08.050> default<00:01:08.880> pencil

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
tool the first being the default pencil

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.030 
tool the first being the default pencil
styles<00:01:10.330> so<00:01:10.870> there<00:01:11.020> are<00:01:11.080> six<00:01:11.290> default<00:01:11.680> styles

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
styles so there are six default styles

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.240 
styles so there are six default styles
here<00:01:12.250> I'm<00:01:13.150> going<00:01:13.330> to<00:01:13.390> choose<00:01:13.570> number<00:01:13.690> six<00:01:14.250> and

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
here I'm going to choose number six and

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.070 
here I'm going to choose number six and
with<00:01:15.460> each<00:01:15.670> of<00:01:15.820> these<00:01:15.940> styles<00:01:16.450> there's<00:01:16.750> you

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
with each of these styles there's you

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.930 
with each of these styles there's you
have<00:01:17.230> the<00:01:17.410> ability<00:01:17.920> to<00:01:17.950> change<00:01:18.340> the<00:01:18.640> width<00:01:18.820> of

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
have the ability to change the width of

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.230 
have the ability to change the width of
the<00:01:19.090> pencil<00:01:19.510> and<00:01:19.720> it's<00:01:20.110> smoothing<00:01:21.030> unlike<00:01:22.030> the

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
the pencil and it's smoothing unlike the

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.670 
the pencil and it's smoothing unlike the
brush<00:01:22.450> in<00:01:22.600> the<00:01:22.630> eraser<00:01:22.960> where<00:01:23.320> you<00:01:23.410> have<00:01:23.560> a

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
brush in the eraser where you have a

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.070 
brush in the eraser where you have a
minimum<00:01:23.980> and<00:01:24.280> maximum<00:01:24.610> value<00:01:25.120> you<00:01:25.330> just<00:01:25.870> have

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
minimum and maximum value you just have

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.840 
minimum and maximum value you just have
a<00:01:26.260> maximum<00:01:26.770> width<00:01:26.950> value<00:01:27.510> because<00:01:28.510> the<00:01:28.780> pencil

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
a maximum width value because the pencil

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.240 
a maximum width value because the pencil
line<00:01:30.850> is<00:01:31.240> it<00:01:31.870> has<00:01:31.990> a<00:01:32.020> consistent<00:01:32.680> width<00:01:32.950> all

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
line is it has a consistent width all

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.400 
line is it has a consistent width all
the<00:01:33.790> way<00:01:33.910> through<00:01:36.480> once<00:01:37.480> again<00:01:37.600> if<00:01:38.020> you<00:01:38.170> have<00:01:38.200> a

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:38.410 
the way through once again if you have a

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.880 
the way through once again if you have a
fairly<00:01:39.100> low<00:01:39.310> value<00:01:39.670> for<00:01:39.850> the<00:01:39.910> smoothing<00:01:40.890> your

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
fairly low value for the smoothing your

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.650 
fairly low value for the smoothing your
line<00:01:42.070> will<00:01:42.310> stay<00:01:42.460> fairly<00:01:42.670> faithful<00:01:43.030> whereas

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:43.660 
line will stay fairly faithful whereas

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.370 
line will stay fairly faithful whereas
if<00:01:43.780> you<00:01:44.430> increase<00:01:45.430> the<00:01:45.820> smoothing<00:01:46.480> quite<00:01:47.350> a

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
if you increase the smoothing quite a

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:53.280 
if you increase the smoothing quite a
bit<00:01:50.520> your<00:01:51.520> line<00:01:51.700> will<00:01:51.850> get<00:01:52.000> some<00:01:52.180> about<00:01:52.450> quite

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
bit your line will get some about quite

00:01:53.290 --> 00:02:02.490 
bit your line will get some about quite
a<00:01:53.350> bit<00:01:53.440> as<00:01:53.650> well

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.570 

so<00:02:03.500> I'm<00:02:03.590> going<00:02:03.770> to<00:02:03.830> start<00:02:04.070> to<00:02:04.160> trace<00:02:04.400> the

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
so I'm going to start to trace the

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:31.120 
so I'm going to start to trace the
rabbit

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.440 

you'll<00:02:32.130> notice<00:02:32.370> that<00:02:32.430> I'm<00:02:32.610> overshooting<00:02:33.270> my

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
you'll notice that I'm overshooting my

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.750 
you'll notice that I'm overshooting my
lines<00:02:33.720> quite<00:02:34.020> a<00:02:34.080> bit<00:02:34.319> here<00:02:34.530> with<00:02:34.709> the<00:02:34.860> ears<00:02:35.100> but

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
lines quite a bit here with the ears but

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.920 
lines quite a bit here with the ears but
don't<00:02:35.940> worry<00:02:36.090> about<00:02:36.209> that<00:02:36.480> we're<00:02:36.750> going<00:02:36.870> to

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
don't worry about that we're going to

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:53.300 
don't worry about that we're going to
clean<00:02:37.140> that<00:02:37.230> up<00:02:37.290> later<00:02:37.410> in<00:02:38.400> another<00:02:39.000> tutorial

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.150 

so<00:02:54.310> as<00:02:54.400> you<00:02:54.520> notice<00:02:54.670> here<00:02:54.790> all<00:02:55.120> of<00:02:55.330> my<00:02:55.480> lines

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
so as you notice here all of my lines

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.350 
so as you notice here all of my lines
are<00:02:57.300> currently<00:02:58.300> individual<00:02:59.230> strokes<00:02:59.640> I<00:03:00.640> can

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
are currently individual strokes I can

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.920 
are currently individual strokes I can
move<00:03:01.540> them<00:03:01.720> around<00:03:01.840> and<00:03:02.500> manipulate<00:03:03.070> them<00:03:03.930> as

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
move them around and manipulate them as

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.420 
move them around and manipulate them as
such<00:03:06.840> but<00:03:07.840> when<00:03:08.020> you<00:03:08.110> draw<00:03:08.380> a<00:03:08.680> cut<00:03:09.340> of

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430 
such but when you draw a cut of

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.760 
such but when you draw a cut of
character<00:03:09.880> you<00:03:10.810> don't<00:03:10.840> really<00:03:11.200> want<00:03:11.470> a<00:03:11.530> bunch

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
character you don't really want a bunch

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.850 
character you don't really want a bunch
of<00:03:12.040> separate<00:03:13.030> lines<00:03:13.390> floating<00:03:13.930> around<00:03:14.170> what

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:14.860 
of separate lines floating around what

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.380 
of separate lines floating around what
you<00:03:14.950> probably<00:03:15.160> want<00:03:15.370> is<00:03:15.700> all<00:03:15.910> of<00:03:16.030> your<00:03:16.150> lines

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
you probably want is all of your lines

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.200 
you probably want is all of your lines
to<00:03:16.600> be<00:03:16.660> merged<00:03:16.900> together<00:03:17.170> as<00:03:17.710> one<00:03:18.580> shape<00:03:18.940> so

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.210 
to be merged together as one shape so

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:20.510 
to be merged together as one shape so
that<00:03:19.240> you<00:03:19.420> can<00:03:19.570> move<00:03:19.720> them<00:03:19.840> around<00:03:19.930> together

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:20.520 
that you can move them around together

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.200 
that you can move them around together
so<00:03:21.520> to<00:03:21.580> do<00:03:21.790> this<00:03:23.310> you<00:03:24.310> just<00:03:24.340> have<00:03:24.550> to<00:03:24.760> click<00:03:25.060> on

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:25.210 
so to do this you just have to click on

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.950 
so to do this you just have to click on
the<00:03:25.780> auto<00:03:26.140> flatten<00:03:27.100> option<00:03:27.550> in<00:03:27.940> the<00:03:28.510> pencil

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:28.960 
the auto flatten option in the pencil

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.700 
the auto flatten option in the pencil
tools<00:03:29.500> tool<00:03:29.800> properties<00:03:30.660> and<00:03:31.660> watch<00:03:32.440> what<00:03:32.620> the

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:32.710 
tools tool properties and watch what the

00:03:32.710 --> 00:04:00.140 
tools tool properties and watch what the
difference<00:03:33.040> is<00:03:33.220> as<00:03:33.460> I<00:03:33.640> draw<00:03:33.820> the<00:03:33.880> second<00:03:34.270> ear

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.390 

so<00:04:00.750> now<00:04:00.900> my<00:04:01.110> slick<00:04:01.409> lines<00:04:01.709> with<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:02.069> rabbit

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
so now my slick lines with the rabbit

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.330 
so now my slick lines with the rabbit
ear<00:04:02.670> you'll<00:04:03.299> see<00:04:03.599> that<00:04:03.900> all<00:04:04.530> the<00:04:04.980> lines<00:04:05.159> were

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
ear you'll see that all the lines were

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.949 
ear you'll see that all the lines were
selected<00:04:05.849> except<00:04:06.150> for<00:04:06.330> this<00:04:06.510> line<00:04:06.720> right<00:04:06.900> here

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
selected except for this line right here

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:08.479 
selected except for this line right here
and<00:04:07.379> that's<00:04:07.530> because<00:04:07.830> this<00:04:08.040> line<00:04:08.250> doesn't

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
and that's because this line doesn't

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:13.009 
and that's because this line doesn't
actually<00:04:09.049> overlap<00:04:10.049> or<00:04:10.349> cross<00:04:10.650> over<00:04:12.019> the

beside it but all the other lines are

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.520 
beside it but all the other lines are
selected<00:04:17.760> so<00:04:17.970> what<00:04:18.660> happens<00:04:18.989> with<00:04:19.260> the<00:04:19.380> Auto

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
selected so what happens with the Auto

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.379 
selected so what happens with the Auto
flat<00:04:19.949> and<00:04:20.130> with<00:04:20.220> central<00:04:20.609> vector<00:04:20.970> lines<00:04:21.150> is

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
flat and with central vector lines is

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:22.730 
flat and with central vector lines is
that<00:04:21.540> they<00:04:21.630> actually<00:04:21.989> get<00:04:22.139> grouped<00:04:22.440> together

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
that they actually get grouped together

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.520 
that they actually get grouped together
and<00:04:23.340> are<00:04:23.699> considered<00:04:24.180> one<00:04:24.360> shape<00:04:24.720> even<00:04:25.260> though

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
and are considered one shape even though

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.620 
and are considered one shape even though
they<00:04:25.770> look<00:04:26.010> like<00:04:26.160> they<00:04:26.340> still<00:04:26.550> retain<00:04:26.699> their

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
they look like they still retain their

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.000 
they look like they still retain their
central<00:04:28.110> vector<00:04:28.440> and<00:04:30.590> just<00:04:31.590> like<00:04:31.740> the<00:04:31.830> other

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
central vector and just like the other

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:45.140 
central vector and just like the other
line<00:04:32.250> can<00:04:32.490> be<00:04:32.610> manipulated<00:04:33.300> as<00:04:33.510> such<00:04:44.150> I'm

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
line can be manipulated as such I'm

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.400 
line can be manipulated as such I'm
going<00:04:45.330> to<00:04:45.389> continue<00:04:45.600> drawing<00:04:45.960> here<00:04:46.199> for<00:04:46.380> a

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
going to continue drawing here for a

00:04:46.410 --> 00:05:00.730 
going to continue drawing here for a
minute<00:04:50.900> and<00:04:51.949> then<00:04:52.949> add<00:04:53.220> a<00:04:53.250> swatch

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.340 

so<00:05:01.640> what<00:05:01.790> I'm<00:05:01.880> doing<00:05:01.910> here<00:05:02.150> is<00:05:02.630> creating<00:05:02.870> a<00:05:03.140> new

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
so what I'm doing here is creating a new

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.790 
so what I'm doing here is creating a new
swatch<00:05:04.220> for<00:05:04.550> the<00:05:04.670> teeth<00:05:05.030> outline<00:05:05.680> and<00:05:06.680> I'll

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:06.800 
swatch for the teeth outline and I'll

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:07.960 
swatch for the teeth outline and I'll
show<00:05:07.010> you<00:05:07.040> why<00:05:07.340> in<00:05:07.400> a<00:05:07.520> minute

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
show you why in a minute

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.520 
show you why in a minute
so<00:05:08.900> say<00:05:09.800> I<00:05:09.830> decide<00:05:10.250> that<00:05:10.430> I<00:05:10.640> want<00:05:11.330> to<00:05:11.630> give<00:05:11.840> the

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
so say I decide that I want to give the

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.650 
so say I decide that I want to give the
teeth<00:05:12.830> of<00:05:13.070> this<00:05:13.280> rabbit<00:05:13.520> a<00:05:13.880> different<00:05:14.480> colored

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 
teeth of this rabbit a different colored

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.240 
teeth of this rabbit a different colored
outline<00:05:14.960> I<00:05:14.990> don't<00:05:15.260> want<00:05:15.440> to<00:05:15.530> give<00:05:15.650> the<00:05:15.830> teeth<00:05:16.040> a

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
outline I don't want to give the teeth a

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.280 
outline I don't want to give the teeth a
black<00:05:16.520> outline<00:05:16.820> I<00:05:17.330> don't<00:05:17.900> want<00:05:18.020> to<00:05:18.080> give<00:05:18.200> it

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:18.290 
black outline I don't want to give it

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.800 
black outline I don't want to give it
this<00:05:18.410> gray<00:05:18.680> outline<00:05:18.950> here<00:05:19.370> but<00:05:20.030> I<00:05:20.060> also<00:05:20.390> want

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
this gray outline here but I also want

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.710 
this gray outline here but I also want
to<00:05:20.900> have<00:05:21.620> this<00:05:21.800> outline<00:05:22.280> set<00:05:22.790> underneath<00:05:23.240> the

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
to have this outline set underneath the

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.140 
to have this outline set underneath the
mouth<00:05:24.020> of<00:05:24.380> the<00:05:24.500> rabbit<00:05:24.950> to<00:05:25.670> do<00:05:25.790> this<00:05:25.940> easily

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
mouth of the rabbit to do this easily

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.170 
mouth of the rabbit to do this easily
you<00:05:26.570> just<00:05:27.050> need<00:05:27.260> to<00:05:27.380> select<00:05:27.620> the<00:05:28.340> draw<00:05:28.700> behind

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
you just need to select the draw behind

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.200 
you just need to select the draw behind
option<00:05:29.750> here<00:05:30.050> in<00:05:30.200> the<00:05:30.830> tools<00:05:31.040> property<00:05:31.460> I'm

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
option here in the tools property I'm

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:44.360 
option here in the tools property I'm
going<00:05:32.390> to<00:05:33.460> unclick<00:05:34.460> the<00:05:34.610> auto<00:05:34.790> flag

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.450 

so<00:05:44.910> as<00:05:45.000> you<00:05:45.150> notice<00:05:45.330> the<00:05:45.750> gray<00:05:45.990> lines<00:05:46.460> instead

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
so as you notice the gray lines instead

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:51.080 
so as you notice the gray lines instead
of<00:05:47.580> being<00:05:47.790> drawn<00:05:48.060> on<00:05:48.449> top<00:05:49.290> of<00:05:49.470> the<00:05:49.560> mouth<00:05:50.090> now

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
of being drawn on top of the mouth now

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.540 
of being drawn on top of the mouth now
actually<00:05:51.449> sit<00:05:51.660> behind<00:05:51.960> the<00:05:52.320> mouth<00:05:52.500> but<00:05:53.460> the

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:53.550 
actually sit behind the mouth but the

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:56.540 
actually sit behind the mouth but the
only<00:05:53.699> problem<00:05:54.120> is<00:05:54.270> they<00:05:54.540> also<00:05:54.780> sit<00:05:55.350> behind<00:05:55.550> the

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:56.550 
only problem is they also sit behind the

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.510 
only problem is they also sit behind the
black<00:05:56.820> outline<00:05:57.120> of<00:05:57.540> the<00:05:57.810> face<00:05:58.080> so<00:05:58.860> if<00:05:59.130> I<00:05:59.280> want

00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 
black outline of the face so if I want

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.480 
black outline of the face so if I want
to<00:05:59.639> now<00:05:59.970> bring<00:06:00.650> these<00:06:01.650> teeth<00:06:01.860> forward<00:06:02.310> or

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
to now bring these teeth forward or

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.510 
to now bring these teeth forward or
rather<00:06:02.669> bring<00:06:03.180> the<00:06:03.510> outline<00:06:03.900> of<00:06:03.930> the<00:06:04.229> face

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520 
rather bring the outline of the face

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.460 
rather bring the outline of the face
backward<00:06:05.520> or<00:06:05.699> behind<00:06:06.060> the<00:06:06.270> gray<00:06:06.419> line<00:06:06.660> I<00:06:06.900> just

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:07.470 
backward or behind the gray line I just

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.730 
backward or behind the gray line I just
need<00:06:07.560> to<00:06:07.680> select<00:06:07.979> them<00:06:09.199> hold<00:06:10.199> down<00:06:10.320> shift<00:06:10.650> to

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740 
need to select them hold down shift to

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:15.680 
need to select them hold down shift to
select<00:06:10.889> both<00:06:11.930> and<00:06:13.760> then<00:06:14.760> go<00:06:14.940> to<00:06:15.000> the<00:06:15.240> top<00:06:15.419> menu

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:15.690 
select both and then go to the top menu

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:19.510 
select both and then go to the top menu
it's<00:06:15.900> like<00:06:16.020> drawing<00:06:16.310> arrange<00:06:17.780> sent<00:06:18.780> it<00:06:18.930> back

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.520 
it's like drawing arrange sent it back

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.420 
it's like drawing arrange sent it back
so<00:06:20.520> now<00:06:20.729> the<00:06:21.680> outline<00:06:22.680> of<00:06:22.710> the<00:06:22.919> face<00:06:23.100> that's

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:23.430 
so now the outline of the face that's

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.460 
so now the outline of the face that's
behind<00:06:23.880> the<00:06:24.030> teeth<00:06:24.270> and<00:06:24.510> the<00:06:24.720> teeth<00:06:24.930> outlines

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:25.470 
behind the teeth and the teeth outlines

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:32.480 
behind the teeth and the teeth outlines
sit<00:06:26.250> behind<00:06:26.400> the<00:06:26.669> line<00:06:26.850> of<00:06:27.030> the<00:06:27.090> mouth<00:06:31.490> the

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:32.490 
sit behind the line of the mouth the

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:33.500 
sit behind the line of the mouth the
last<00:06:32.669> thing<00:06:32.790> I'd<00:06:32.910> like<00:06:32.940> to<00:06:33.090> show<00:06:33.330> you<00:06:33.419> is<00:06:33.479> how

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:33.510 
last thing I'd like to show you is how

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:36.710 
last thing I'd like to show you is how
to<00:06:33.750> use<00:06:34.050> the<00:06:34.080> auto<00:06:34.470> close<00:06:35.100> gap<00:06:35.520> option<00:06:36.120> let's

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 
to use the auto close gap option let's

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.100 
to use the auto close gap option let's
click<00:06:36.930> on<00:06:37.080> that<00:06:37.110> and<00:06:38.090> to<00:06:39.090> see<00:06:39.300> how<00:06:39.419> this<00:06:39.600> option

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:40.110 
click on that and to see how this option

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:45.080 
click on that and to see how this option
works<00:06:40.850> you<00:06:41.850> should<00:06:42.060> enable<00:06:43.460> the<00:06:44.460> show<00:06:44.760> all

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:45.090 
works you should enable the show all

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:46.969 
works you should enable the show all
strokes<00:06:45.510> feature<00:06:45.780> so<00:06:45.990> you<00:06:46.080> can<00:06:46.229> go<00:06:46.380> to<00:06:46.440> view

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:46.979 
strokes feature so you can go to view

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:50.779 
strokes feature so you can go to view
show<00:06:48.770> show<00:06:49.770> strokes<00:06:50.130> or<00:06:50.370> use<00:06:50.520> the<00:06:50.639> keyboard

00:06:50.779 --> 00:06:50.789 
show show strokes or use the keyboard

00:06:50.789 --> 00:06:53.390 
show show strokes or use the keyboard
shortcut<00:06:51.419> D<00:06:51.919> so<00:06:52.919> what<00:06:53.070> this<00:06:53.160> feature

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:53.400 
shortcut D so what this feature

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.900 
shortcut D so what this feature
basically<00:06:53.850> does<00:06:54.180> is<00:06:54.510> it<00:06:54.870> ensures<00:06:55.080> that<00:06:55.910> every

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:56.910 
basically does is it ensures that every

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:58.969 
basically does is it ensures that every
stroke<00:06:57.120> you<00:06:57.300> draw<00:06:57.539> will<00:06:58.050> make<00:06:58.260> a<00:06:58.440> closed<00:06:58.800> zone

00:06:58.969 --> 00:06:58.979 
stroke you draw will make a closed zone

00:06:58.979 --> 00:07:01.820 
stroke you draw will make a closed zone
and<00:06:59.400> this<00:06:59.789> is<00:06:59.940> good<00:07:00.150> for<00:07:00.330> when<00:07:00.599> need<00:07:01.139> to<00:07:01.380> paint

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:01.830 
and this is good for when need to paint

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:03.560 
and this is good for when need to paint
your<00:07:02.160> object<00:07:02.639> because<00:07:02.880> obviously<00:07:03.360> you<00:07:03.450> can

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:03.570 
your object because obviously you can

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:05.540 
your object because obviously you can
only<00:07:03.690> paint<00:07:04.110> the<00:07:04.710> zones<00:07:04.950> that<00:07:05.220> are<00:07:05.340> fully

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:05.550 
only paint the zones that are fully

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:14.300 
only paint the zones that are fully
closed<00:07:05.910> so<00:07:06.539> I'll<00:07:06.630> show<00:07:06.750> you<00:07:06.780> what<00:07:06.990> I<00:07:07.080> mean<00:07:13.310> so

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:14.310 
closed so I'll show you what I mean so

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:19.790 
closed so I'll show you what I mean so
this<00:07:14.639> stroke<00:07:15.300> is<00:07:15.780> not<00:07:15.840> actually<00:07:16.650> touching<00:07:18.800> the

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:19.800 
this stroke is not actually touching the

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.440 
this stroke is not actually touching the
black<00:07:20.010> stroke<00:07:20.400> here<00:07:20.610> or<00:07:20.820> it<00:07:21.000> may<00:07:21.180> be<00:07:21.240> it's<00:07:21.419> like

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:21.450 
black stroke here or it may be it's like

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:22.909 
black stroke here or it may be it's like
barely<00:07:21.810> touching<00:07:22.289> but<00:07:22.410> it<00:07:22.440> doesn't<00:07:22.770> cross

00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:22.919 
barely touching but it doesn't cross

00:07:22.919 --> 00:07:26.029 
barely touching but it doesn't cross
over<00:07:23.220> but<00:07:23.370> to<00:07:23.520> make<00:07:23.760> sure<00:07:24.030> that<00:07:24.210> this<00:07:24.650> zone<00:07:25.650> is

00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:26.039 
over but to make sure that this zone is

00:07:26.039 --> 00:07:28.790 
over but to make sure that this zone is
closed<00:07:26.820> off<00:07:27.120> this<00:07:27.930> central<00:07:28.349> vector<00:07:28.650> line

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:28.800 
closed off this central vector line

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.440 
closed off this central vector line
snapped<00:07:29.250> from<00:07:29.520> being<00:07:29.760> at<00:07:29.849> the<00:07:29.940> end<00:07:30.060> of<00:07:30.330> the

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:30.450 
snapped from being at the end of the

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:33.589 
snapped from being at the end of the
stroke<00:07:30.870> to<00:07:31.680> actually<00:07:32.190> jumping<00:07:33.060> over<00:07:33.240> this<00:07:33.330> gap

00:07:33.589 --> 00:07:33.599 
stroke to actually jumping over this gap

00:07:33.599 --> 00:07:36.760 
stroke to actually jumping over this gap
and<00:07:33.870> touching<00:07:34.500> the<00:07:35.460> central<00:07:35.820> vector<00:07:36.150> line

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:36.770 
and touching the central vector line

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:39.740 
and touching the central vector line
right<00:07:37.770> in<00:07:37.800> front<00:07:38.280> and<00:07:38.550> so<00:07:38.880> what<00:07:39.180> what<00:07:39.599> that's

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:39.750 
right in front and so what what that's

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:41.750 
right in front and so what what that's
basically<00:07:40.200> doing<00:07:40.710> is<00:07:40.860> just<00:07:41.039> letting<00:07:41.550> you<00:07:41.729> know

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:41.760 
basically doing is just letting you know

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.100 
basically doing is just letting you know
it's<00:07:42.060> giving<00:07:42.300> a<00:07:42.360> piece<00:07:42.539> of<00:07:42.690> mind<00:07:42.870> that<00:07:42.960> no

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:43.110 
it's giving a piece of mind that no

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:44.629 
it's giving a piece of mind that no
matter<00:07:43.200> what<00:07:43.410> you<00:07:43.530> do<00:07:43.710> even<00:07:44.370> if<00:07:44.550> you're

00:07:44.629 --> 00:07:44.639 
matter what you do even if you're

00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:45.980 
matter what you do even if you're
drawing<00:07:44.820> really<00:07:45.060> quickly<00:07:45.389> and<00:07:45.539> maybe<00:07:45.720> not

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:45.990 
drawing really quickly and maybe not

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:48.770

completely connecting lines the soft

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:50.420 
completely connecting lines the soft
will<00:07:48.960> connect<00:07:49.289> those<00:07:49.440> lines<00:07:49.560> for<00:07:49.979> you<00:07:50.220> and

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:50.430 
will connect those lines for you and

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:52.790 
will connect those lines for you and
show<00:07:50.849> that<00:07:50.970> you<00:07:51.090> have<00:07:51.300> closed<00:07:51.720> zones<00:07:51.990> that<00:07:52.680> you

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:52.800 
show that you have closed zones that you

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:56.300 
show that you have closed zones that you
can<00:07:52.979> paint<00:07:53.219> later<00:07:53.909> on<00:07:54.260> so<00:07:55.260> you<00:07:55.349> can<00:07:55.560> disable

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:56.310 
can paint later on so you can disable

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:58.190 
can paint later on so you can disable
