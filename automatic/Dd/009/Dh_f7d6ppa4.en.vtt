00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
for I'm writing about 600 pound range

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.050 
for I'm writing about 600 pound range
which<00:00:27.449> should<00:00:27.630> probably<00:00:28.199> be<00:00:28.490> about<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.699> hundred

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
which should probably be about a hundred

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.229 
which should probably be about a hundred
dollars<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:31.019> if<00:00:31.500> you're<00:00:31.710> in<00:00:31.800> America<00:00:32.009> so<00:00:32.460> I

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
dollars and if you're in America so I

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
got mine from a website called SLR hut I

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.850 
got mine from a website called SLR hut I
will<00:00:36.960> link<00:00:37.140> them<00:00:37.320> down<00:00:37.380> in<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.739> description

which<00:00:38.480> seemed<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.570> be<00:00:39.750> about<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:40.020> hundred

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
which seemed to be about a hundred

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.530 
which seemed to be about a hundred
pounds<00:00:40.620> cheaper<00:00:41.219> than<00:00:41.370> everywhere<00:00:41.730> else<00:00:41.790> even

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
pounds cheaper than everywhere else even

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.869 
pounds cheaper than everywhere else even
armisen<00:00:43.200> which<00:00:43.710> I<00:00:43.890> thought<00:00:44.129> was<00:00:44.250> pretty<00:00:44.309> good

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
armisen which I thought was pretty good

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.500 
armisen which I thought was pretty good
so<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.510> have<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.170> specs<00:00:46.559> up<00:00:46.890> on<00:00:47.280> my<00:00:47.700> ipod<00:00:48.149> here

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
so I have the specs up on my ipod here

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.229 
so I have the specs up on my ipod here
and<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:49.350> they<00:00:49.770> are<00:00:49.920> pretty<00:00:50.160> good<00:00:50.520> this<00:00:50.700> camera

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
and and they are pretty good this camera

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.900 
and and they are pretty good this camera
is<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:52.199> highest<00:00:52.739> pretty<00:00:53.160> much<00:00:53.399> the<00:00:53.520> highest

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
is the highest pretty much the highest

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.369 
is the highest pretty much the highest

specs entry-level camera the nikon makes
it's<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.920> bit<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.250> mix<00:01:02.520> between<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:03.030> d<00:01:03.290> 5200

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
it's a bit of a mix between the d 5200

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.660 
it's a bit of a mix between the d 5200
and<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:05.000> 3200<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.320> it<00:01:07.320> has<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:07.740> huge<00:01:08.159> mega

pixel range that I'm going to love to

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.490 
pixel range that I'm going to love to
play<00:01:11.280> about<00:01:11.460> with<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.939> so<00:01:12.810> I'll<00:01:13.020> just<00:01:13.049> read

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
play about with and so I'll just read

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.020 
play about with and so I'll just read
out<00:01:13.619> some<00:01:13.680> of<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.010> specs<00:01:14.310> so<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.610> has<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.790> new

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
out some of the specs so it has a new

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.670 
out some of the specs so it has a new
CMOS<00:01:15.540> sensor<00:01:16.140> in<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:17.450> it<00:01:18.450> has<00:01:18.680> 24

high<00:01:24.180> i<00:01:24.210> associate<00:01:24.960> I<00:01:25.110> think<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.560> goes<00:01:25.680> up<00:01:25.830> to

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
high i associate I think it goes up to

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:33.020 
high i associate I think it goes up to
25,000<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.439> has<00:01:28.590> sensor<00:01:29.220> cleaning<00:01:31.009> LLC<00:01:32.030> 3-inch

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
25,000 it has sensor cleaning LLC 3-inch

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.569 
25,000 it has sensor cleaning LLC 3-inch
LCD<00:01:33.329> screen<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.470> flips<00:01:34.829> out<00:01:35.040> so<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.400> course

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
LCD screen and it flips out so of course

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.460 
LCD screen and it flips out so of course
you<00:01:35.790> got<00:01:35.939> some<00:01:36.150> really<00:01:36.299> viewing<00:01:36.810> angles<00:01:37.259> there

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
you got some really viewing angles there

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.420 
you got some really viewing angles there
and<00:01:38.240> normal<00:01:39.240> Nikon<00:01:39.630> lenses<00:01:40.290> fell<00:01:40.560> on<00:01:40.680> here<00:01:40.979> I'm

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
and normal Nikon lenses fell on here I'm

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.490 
and normal Nikon lenses fell on here I'm
sorry<00:01:42.740> it<00:01:43.740> shoots<00:01:44.220> in<00:01:44.460> 1080p<00:01:45.119> at<00:01:45.570> 30<00:01:45.960> frames<00:01:46.259> a

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
sorry it shoots in 1080p at 30 frames a

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.899 
sorry it shoots in 1080p at 30 frames a
second<00:01:46.920> so<00:01:47.100> you'll<00:01:47.220> be<00:01:47.340> able<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.579> get<00:01:47.729> some

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
second so you'll be able to get some

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:54.160 
second so you'll be able to get some
nice<00:01:48.090> slow-mo<00:01:48.570> going<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:50.149> it<00:01:51.560> does<00:01:52.560> HDR<00:01:53.490> and

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
nice slow-mo going and it does HDR and

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.139 
nice slow-mo going and it does HDR and
obviously<00:01:55.170> supports<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.740> raw<00:01:55.860> files<00:01:56.189> it<00:01:56.969> can

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
obviously supports and raw files it can

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.810 
obviously supports and raw files it can
shoot<00:01:57.420> five<00:01:57.810> frames<00:01:58.350> per<00:01:58.649> second<00:01:59.189> so<00:01:59.460> if

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
shoot five frames per second so if

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.870 
shoot five frames per second so if
you're<00:02:00.149> trying<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.479> capture<00:02:00.979> say<00:02:01.979> some<00:02:02.579> guy<00:02:02.820> do

you're trying to capture say some guy do
the<00:02:03.060> cool<00:02:03.420> backflip<00:02:03.930> you<00:02:04.079> can<00:02:04.229> shoot<00:02:04.439> five

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
the cool backflip you can shoot five

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.570 
the cool backflip you can shoot five
times<00:02:05.310> in<00:02:05.490> one<00:02:05.700> second<00:02:06.270> which<00:02:06.930> is<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:07.580> fairly

times in one second which is a fairly

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.010 
times in one second which is a fairly
good<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:10.200> maximum<00:02:10.830> shutter<00:02:11.160> speed<00:02:11.550> is<00:02:12.020> 14

of<00:02:13.709> a<00:02:13.890> second<00:02:14.400> and<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:15.000> minimum<00:02:15.390> is<00:02:15.750> 30

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
of a second and the minimum is 30

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.410 
of a second and the minimum is 30
seconds<00:02:16.830> so<00:02:17.130> that's<00:02:17.489> a<00:02:17.640> fairly<00:02:17.940> good<00:02:18.180> range

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
seconds so that's a fairly good range

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.740 
seconds so that's a fairly good range
you<00:02:18.660> have<00:02:18.840> there<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:19.680> it<00:02:20.090> supports<00:02:21.090> normal<00:02:21.540> SD

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
you have there and it supports normal SD

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.500 
you have there and it supports normal SD

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
from myth on so this is a hugely

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.800 
from myth on so this is a hugely
powerful<00:02:28.260> camera<00:02:28.830> with<00:02:29.550> that<00:02:29.849> and<00:02:30.300> it<00:02:30.569> has

powerful camera with that and it has

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.750 
powerful camera with that and it has
tons<00:02:31.230> of<00:02:31.560> brilliant<00:02:32.040> modes<00:02:32.310> you<00:02:32.550> have

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
tons of brilliant modes you have

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.300 
tons of brilliant modes you have
miniature<00:02:33.180> mode<00:02:33.569> which<00:02:34.410> toggles<00:02:34.830> like<00:02:35.190> to

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
miniature mode which toggles like to

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.339 
miniature mode which toggles like to
focus<00:02:35.640> and<00:02:36.209> I<00:02:36.480> don't<00:02:36.660> know<00:02:36.720> quite<00:02:36.900> how<00:02:37.019> it<00:02:37.140> does

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
focus and I don't know quite how it does

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:38.809 
focus and I don't know quite how it does
it<00:02:37.500> and<00:02:37.620> just<00:02:37.709> makes<00:02:38.010> things<00:02:38.160> look<00:02:38.550> really

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
it and just makes things look really

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.320 
it and just makes things look really
cool<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:40.130> color<00:02:41.130> select<00:02:41.640> which<00:02:41.880> basically

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
cool and color select which basically

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.259 
cool and color select which basically
means<00:02:42.599> and<00:02:42.930> if<00:02:43.890> you<00:02:44.040> have<00:02:44.220> one<00:02:44.580> bright<00:02:44.940> color

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
means and if you have one bright color

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.030 
means and if you have one bright color
in<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.510> photo<00:02:45.780> it<00:02:46.140> will<00:02:46.290> turn<00:02:46.470> everything

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
in the photo it will turn everything

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.699 
in the photo it will turn everything
black<00:02:47.430> white<00:02:47.790> apart<00:02:48.209> from<00:02:48.330> that<00:02:48.420> one<00:02:48.810> color<00:02:49.110> so

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
black white apart from that one color so

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.009 
black white apart from that one color so
