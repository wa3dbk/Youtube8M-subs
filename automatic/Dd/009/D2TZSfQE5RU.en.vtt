00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.080
 niro being diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:12.960
 bpco as they say with an acronym a disease that is very common now what it is 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.490
 It is possible to make what news there is Professor Leonardo Fabbri teaches 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.970
 respiratory diseases at the University of Modena Air Reggio Emilia 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.130
 what is this bpco 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.070
 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a chronic disease of the bronchi 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.960
 ringing in the lungs is not a man 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.770
 this is ronic in the sense that it develops slowly and is above all part of the 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.020
 T'avanza that 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.530
 that I must strestrarse because it is associated with a baby obstruction 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.530
 of the tubes of the bronchi that carry the air 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.650
 to the lung and to the lung today it is much more frequent than in the past because the 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.690
 causes first we pay the price of smoking in past years is 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.930
 a disease that develops after 20 30 years but also 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.930
 of benefit of instead of the population that survives of and 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.060
 survive acute events 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.390
 and therefore develops chronic conditions such as bronchopneumopathy and diseases 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:14.780
 chronic to it 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.990
 associated they are patrimony of the most advanced age and with her like pneumologist 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.800
 how to treat these patients 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.350
 be still smoke I try to 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.390
 to make them stop smoking 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.140
 there are new tools for this 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.120
 and then 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.400
 once you are symptomatic with portrait drugs 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.720
 which are hobro nco dilators go anti-inflammatory drugs that in more severe cases 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.890
 inability to cope with a rehabilitative approach what is new? 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.120
 this direction 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.240
 there are new drugs 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.710
 new anti-inflammatory drugs 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.150
 which allow to increase the effectiveness of those available to the key of 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.140
 enhance the effects 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.409
 of rehabilitation
