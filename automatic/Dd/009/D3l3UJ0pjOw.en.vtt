00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
 so means to unscrew further 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:14.660
 trapezoid as we see trapezium attachment 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:19.730
 and asterisks mean any set 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.730
 cars have become asterisks 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:27.140
 gloss and 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:01:00.070
 not clamped 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:05.949
 so everything is fine unscrewed 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:05.949
 after all, half 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:30.860
 so further inside skull 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:56.600
 goes on so seemingly nothing more 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:59.990
 do not interfere in my opinion so as to pull out 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:07.700
 motor not seen from rickets could not 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:20.480
 pull out does not interfere with the mount does not need it 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:22.190
 using take out take out here you see 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.570
 old nut does not need to unscrew 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:31.760
 we can fully deliver 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:39.100
 Well , just pull out after this 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:39.100
 traffic just wave aha normal above 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.820
 Further 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:03:05.040
 then you need to remove 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:12.390
 disconnect the wiring we do it not 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:15.630
 every day so we continue nafig we shoot 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:20.700
 we define a chip completely 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:23.390
 trapezoid wiring and all here it is 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.390
 we stupid
