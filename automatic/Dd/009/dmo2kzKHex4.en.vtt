00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.930
 the director and producer of pizza

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.570
 outside the composer of his productions

 on this occasion he returns michael giacchino

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.130
 star trek tapes 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:15.580
 according to pete docter every emotion is based 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.460
 in a way the joy is based on a 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:22.030
 star in sadness in a tear 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:24.970
 anger is a fear fire brick 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:28.570
 it is a sensitive point and the dislike of 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:32.010
 subgroups where he pointed out that he used this 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:35.620
 vegetable since he never liked 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.950
 at the beginning the emotions of our 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:42.280
 protagonist were going to do so many 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:45.340
 reaching up to 27 that included surprise 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:48.580
 and pride and confidence but the 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.890
 screenwriters quickly noticed that they were 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:54.850
 too many characters and a spectator 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:59.850
 small could get confused like this 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.850
 that reduced them to only 5 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:06.780
 This is the fifteenth feature film by 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:10.379
 the pixar animation studios that 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:13.980
 he counted a small team of only 45 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:16.350
 animators that is approximately the 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.810
 half the size of collaborators that has 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.760
 intervened in previous films of 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.580

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:29.940
 Previous pixar movies except 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:32.700
 the toy story 2 and cars 2 there is also 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.940
 a sequence where emotions 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:38.970
 freeze similar to the scene where the 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:43.180

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:46.060
