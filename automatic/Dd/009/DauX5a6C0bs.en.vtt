it's<00:00:42.770> something<00:00:42.890> unique<00:00:43.160> to<00:00:43.310> the<00:00:43.430> to<00:00:44.420> the

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
it's something unique to the to the

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.540 
it's something unique to the to the
eclipse<00:00:44.960> amplifiers<00:00:45.560> and<00:00:46.070> we<00:00:46.190> want<00:00:46.340> to<00:00:46.400> take<00:00:46.520> a

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
eclipse amplifiers and we want to take a

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.660 
eclipse amplifiers and we want to take a
closer<00:00:46.850> look<00:00:46.970> at<00:00:47.270> this<00:00:47.570> so<00:00:48.320> you<00:00:48.410> can<00:00:48.590> see<00:00:48.920> the

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
closer look at this so you can see the

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.069 
closer look at this so you can see the
sides<00:00:51.160> and<00:00:52.160> we<00:00:52.670> want<00:00:52.850> to<00:00:52.910> start<00:00:53.180> here<00:00:53.210> with<00:00:53.989> the

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
sides and we want to start here with the

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:56.290 
sides and we want to start here with the
bottom<00:00:54.620> and<00:00:54.800> the<00:00:54.980> top<00:00:55.190> of<00:00:55.489> the<00:00:55.820> amplifier

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
bottom and the top of the amplifier

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.330 
bottom and the top of the amplifier
where<00:00:56.570> you<00:00:56.630> can<00:00:56.750> see<00:00:56.899> the<00:00:57.020> heat<00:00:57.200> sinks<00:00:57.530> they

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
where you can see the heat sinks they

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.680 
where you can see the heat sinks they
have<00:00:58.460> aluminum<00:00:58.850> heat<00:00:59.000> sinks<00:00:59.239> as<00:00:59.329> well<00:00:59.510> as<00:00:59.600> the

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
have aluminum heat sinks as well as the

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.020 
have aluminum heat sinks as well as the
sides<00:00:59.930> here<00:01:00.200> are<00:01:00.230> all<00:01:00.440> aluminum<00:01:00.950> so<00:01:01.130> it<00:01:01.880> keeps

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
sides here are all aluminum so it keeps

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.119 
sides here are all aluminum so it keeps
