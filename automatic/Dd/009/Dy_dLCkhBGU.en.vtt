00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.160
 Hello everyone today for your android 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.310
 we want to show this device 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.560
 try here is a g2 is the brand 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.960
 china jiayu and good as you can see 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.880
 it has an outside paint really 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.820
 Attractive comes with this metal frame 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.980
 that we can see all the surface 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.900
 front is smooth completely smooth with the 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.480
 buttons also included in the own 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:38.280
 crystal at the top we see that 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.980
 has has we have the power off button 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.900
 and the headphone jack and a 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.480
 rear 8 - megapixel camera on the 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:48.660
 back part has 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.829
 led flash and a single speaker on the other 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.920
 side we have the volume controls 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:56.120
 they are physical and in the bottom 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.120
 we have the microusb connector 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.080
 the outer appearance of the terminal 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.570
 as I say it's really attractive it's 4 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.180
 inches here we can see the lid 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.370
 Rear comes with a good rubbery finish 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.290
 which makes it sit very well in the hand 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.960
 the terminal is fine very well 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.750
 built we did not notice crunches or things 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.520
 and inside we can see that it has 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:23.940
 the slot for microsd micro sd and the two 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.400
 the two slots for sim cards and one 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.530
 2200 milliamp battery that gives a 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.860
 quite good autonomy taking in 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.330
 account the market average is 2200 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.630
 milliamperes that is more than what they usually 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.970
 have 4-inch terminals the 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.250
 screen is a battery as I say 4 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.140
 inch ips has a resolution of 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.380
 similar aspect good equal to that of 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:50.640
 iPhone 5 of 16 ninth and has a 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.050
 resolution of 960 x 540 pixels the 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.119
 screen is one of the strengths and 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.830
 strong terminal looks very good 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.740
 in all conditions 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:02.160
 as version of the operating system comes 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.990
 with living 412 and good moves 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.380
 in a totally fluid way in all 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.119
 the menus and in all situations a 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.690
 box in what the operating system is 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.740
 refers comes with google play because it is already 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.140
 habitual 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.960
 we have as I always say total 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.630
 facility to install applications in 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.340
 our device and it comes with all 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.520
 pre-installed google apps 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.200
 like gmail google maps youtube if you do not 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.260
 we can easily install from google 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.210
 play in the multimedia section the 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.270
 screen as I say it is very good 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:39.010
 quality the 4 inches for some if 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.720
 will be scarce but for another it is for 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.320
 others is the ideal size in a 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.300
 smartphone to me it really seems to me that 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.070
 it's very good the battle yes for me 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.290
 personally it is a pleasure to me it seems a 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.420
 little bit but that's how I say 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.350
 it depends on each one and the use of each 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.350
 one to your incentive 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.990
 we can see what 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:05.970
 we can see that the quality 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.880
 it is good the angle of vision is good 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.490
 both horizontally and vertically not 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.870
 we appreciate color losses as in 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.350
 other screen devices 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.560
 quality 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.240
 and good the sound is also pretty 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.940
 Stable comes with a single speaker like 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.250
 normal that it feels good and not getting 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.160
 to distort even if we put a 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.080
 high volume 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.380
 the volume of notifications also 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.150
 entry in the mean 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.940
 we are seeing a problem in this aspect 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.170
 you can hear the sound of the 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.060
 phone when we receive a call 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.140
 we get a notification from some 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:42.780
 application 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:44.850
 as for the good camera the terminal 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.690
 has two cameras the back of 8 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:50.880
 megapixels and the front of 3 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.830
 the back offers quite good quality 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:57.120
 in optimal lighting conditions 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:58.680
 but you notice a lack of quality 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.820
 quite important in conditions of 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.540
 darkness the led flash that it carries is 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:06.750
 It looks like it's just decorative 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:08.760
 because it does absolutely nothing to the 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.850
 take pictures in the dark you do not notice anything 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.080
 to have it activated turned off as 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.910
 you can see it in light conditions is 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:18.780
 pretty good we're going to see this 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:21.630
 photograph taken outside you can 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:24.570
 see that although we greatly expand the image 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.670
 It has a very good definition and good 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:29.550
 Well, the camera is one of the points 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:31.050
 that I liked the most, I say only in 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.350
 optimal light conditions 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:36.180
 if you are from the xi your two photographs 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.920
 usual photographs are also taken 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.810
 in dark environments because this is 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:43.090
 camera may be a bit scarce 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:45.730
 the internet browsing it is 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.919
 totally fluid resolution of the 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:50.470
 screen for me I say again is a 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:53.290
 subject totally subjective because maybe not 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.580
 is the most suitable to navigate to me 

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:56.800
 like it to be a little wider 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.560
 also if we put it in a landscape 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.210
 for a screen a little more square 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.360
 makes us see more amount of 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:06.040
 content but good that's something 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.480
 personal as I say the navigator moves 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.919
 perfectly fine and we can load 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.400
 any type of pages without any 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:12.080
 type of problem 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.270
 one of the weakest points of the 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.860
 terminal is without a doubt the gps so much for 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.949
 our tests as for things that 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.630
 We have read in various forums and others 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:23.210
 we have verified that the gps does not work 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:25.160
 nothing right and yes there is some tutorial and 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.410
 others to improve this but good is not 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.289
 of receipt that the terminal does not work 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:32.169
 well nothing else to acquire it as for the 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:34.150
 power 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:36.909
 this android terminal carries a 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:39.930
 cortex processor 7 to 1.2 dual core 

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:43.289
 with a gpu powervr 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:45.180
 It has a gig of ram 4gb RAM 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:47.520
 which 2 can be used to 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:50.370
 applications as you see of all the 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.750
 not all games for example we have noticed 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.810
 some hits in nova 3 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:58.940
 but hey move a game this last one 

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:58.940
 last generation quite fluently 

00:05:59.689 --> 00:06:04.159
 and good little more to say about the 

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:06.499
 Outside paragraph as I say to me 

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:11.119
 part that has quite good quality 

00:06:06.499 --> 00:06:14.629
 It measures 125 x 61 tall and wide with a 

00:06:11.119 --> 00:06:17.370
 with a thickness of 9.9 millimeters and weighs 

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:19.350
 around 145 grams 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:21.510
 it feels a bit heavy on the hand but 

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:23.729
 the quality a feeling of quite 

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:25.919
 robustness and not these cheap plastics 

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:29.370
 that seems to creak when 

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:30.630
 we hold is an attractive terminal like 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:32.760
 I say with a reasonable price 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:35.520
 You can see it in the article in prato 

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:38.750
 android and nothing more to say hello to 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.750
 all from for is dotcom android
