through the lips and let it dangle but

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.100 
through the lips and let it dangle but
when<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.340> fishing<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.670> tough<00:01:17.909> my<00:01:18.479> go-to<00:01:18.750> bait

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
when the fishing is tough my go-to bait

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.440 
when the fishing is tough my go-to bait
is<00:01:19.380> always<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.490> peanut<00:01:20.760> butter<00:01:20.850> cracker<00:01:21.180> now

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
is always the peanut butter cracker now

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.270 
is always the peanut butter cracker now
this<00:01:21.660> is<00:01:21.870> a<00:01:22.110> rig<00:01:22.410> that<00:01:22.440> takes<00:01:22.800> a<00:01:22.920> little<00:01:23.070> more

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
this is a rig that takes a little more

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.460 
this is a rig that takes a little more
time<00:01:23.580> but<00:01:23.940> it's<00:01:24.420> worth<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.810> because<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.290> fish

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
time but it's worth it because the fish

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.310 
time but it's worth it because the fish
bite<00:01:25.680> at<00:01:25.860> every<00:01:26.070> turn

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
bite at every turn

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.480 
bite at every turn
basically<00:01:28.320> what<00:01:28.530> you'll<00:01:28.650> do<00:01:28.800> is<00:01:28.920> you<00:01:29.010> take<00:01:29.190> a

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
basically what you'll do is you take a

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.360 
basically what you'll do is you take a
cracker<00:01:29.910> and<00:01:30.480> you'll<00:01:31.170> slather<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.770> with<00:01:32.040> some

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.370 
cracker and you'll slather it with some

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.180 
cracker and you'll slather it with some
peanut<00:01:32.790> butter<00:01:32.910> and<00:01:33.270> then<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.380> use<00:01:34.680> the

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
peanut butter and then you use the

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.540 
peanut butter and then you use the
Mustad<00:01:35.730> cat6<00:01:36.690> triple-a<00:01:37.290> hook<00:01:37.710> what<00:01:38.400> you're

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
Mustad cat6 triple-a hook what you're

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.100 
Mustad cat6 triple-a hook what you're
going<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.700> do<00:01:38.910> is<00:01:39.120> you're<00:01:39.330> going<00:01:39.360> to<00:01:39.570> bury<00:01:39.870> this

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
going to do is you're going to bury this

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.380 
going to do is you're going to bury this
hook<00:01:40.440> into<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.890> cracker<00:01:41.160> thereby<00:01:41.880> making<00:01:42.150> it

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
hook into the cracker thereby making it

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.510 
hook into the cracker thereby making it
a<00:01:42.510> stealth<00:01:42.840> rig<00:01:43.110> when<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.590> add<00:01:43.770> that<00:01:43.800> second

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
a stealth rig when you add that second

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.970 
a stealth rig when you add that second
cracker<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.150> so<00:01:45.480> that's<00:01:45.750> my<00:01:45.900> go-to<00:01:46.080> bait<00:01:46.470> you

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:46.980 
cracker and so that's my go-to bait you

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.190 
cracker and so that's my go-to bait you
can<00:01:47.130> see<00:01:47.280> it's<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.490> stealth<00:01:47.790> rig<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.990> fish

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
can see it's a stealth rig and the fish

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:56.870 
can see it's a stealth rig and the fish
find<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.530> irresistible

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.950 

never<00:01:57.880> in<00:01:58.150> my<00:01:58.180> life

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
never in my life

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.130 
never in my life
million<00:01:59.920> mana<00:02:00.450> so<00:02:01.450> it's<00:02:01.570> always<00:02:01.690> good<00:02:01.900> to<00:02:02.020> have
