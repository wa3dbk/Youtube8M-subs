microplane<00:02:12.610> here<00:02:13.610> are<00:02:13.760> the<00:02:14.000> remaining<00:02:14.450> sliced

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
microplane here are the remaining sliced

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.990 
microplane here are the remaining sliced
up<00:02:15.740> button<00:02:16.270> they're<00:02:17.270> going<00:02:17.630> to<00:02:17.720> go<00:02:17.900> in<00:02:18.819> we<00:02:19.819> want

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
up button they're going to go in we want

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.850 
up button they're going to go in we want
to<00:02:20.090> get<00:02:20.270> these<00:02:20.510> soft<00:02:21.050> I'm<00:02:21.350> gonna<00:02:21.500> raise<00:02:21.650> the

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
to get these soft I'm gonna raise the

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.880 
to get these soft I'm gonna raise the
heat<00:02:22.069> now<00:02:22.280> on<00:02:22.580> this<00:02:22.880> and<00:02:23.360> just<00:02:24.080> start<00:02:24.410> to<00:02:24.680> move

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
heat now on this and just start to move

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.510 
heat now on this and just start to move
those<00:02:25.220> around<00:02:26.230> until<00:02:27.230> they're<00:02:27.560> soft<00:02:27.980> and<00:02:28.400> when

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
those around until they're soft and when

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.790 
those around until they're soft and when
they're<00:02:28.730> soft<00:02:29.090> I'm<00:02:29.420> going<00:02:30.020> to<00:02:30.110> give<00:02:30.230> them<00:02:30.500> a

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
they're soft I'm going to give them a

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.720 
they're soft I'm going to give them a
little<00:02:31.310> bit<00:02:31.459> of<00:02:31.750> wine<00:02:33.100> so<00:02:34.100> you<00:02:34.160> see<00:02:34.520> what's

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
little bit of wine so you see what's

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.020 
little bit of wine so you see what's
happening<00:02:35.270> here<00:02:35.630> these<00:02:35.930> are<00:02:36.110> cooking<00:02:36.410> down

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
happening here these are cooking down

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.100 
happening here these are cooking down
nicely<00:02:38.030> but<00:02:38.150> I<00:02:38.209> want<00:02:38.480> to<00:02:38.570> get<00:02:38.630> them<00:02:38.810> soft

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
nicely but I want to get them soft

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.460 
nicely but I want to get them soft
enough<00:02:39.440> so<00:02:39.709> that<00:02:40.489> I<00:02:40.519> can<00:02:41.030> puree<00:02:41.510> them<00:02:41.989> because

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
enough so that I can puree them because

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.870 
enough so that I can puree them because
then<00:02:42.620> they're<00:02:42.769> going<00:02:42.800> to<00:02:42.950> be<00:02:43.010> added<00:02:43.430> to<00:02:43.790> the

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
then they're going to be added to the

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.080 
then they're going to be added to the
mushrooms<00:02:44.269> that<00:02:44.390> I<00:02:44.450> have<00:02:44.690> in<00:02:44.959> the<00:02:45.200> pan<00:02:45.730> so<00:02:46.730> a

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
mushrooms that I have in the pan so a

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:52.530 
mushrooms that I have in the pan so a
few<00:02:48.080> more<00:02:48.290> minutes<00:02:48.880> and<00:02:49.880> that<00:02:50.090> sauce<00:02:50.420> is<00:02:50.450> ready

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
few more minutes and that sauce is ready

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.910 
few more minutes and that sauce is ready
and<00:02:53.540> we're<00:02:54.500> gonna<00:02:54.590> transfer<00:02:55.340> this<00:02:55.519> to<00:02:55.790> a<00:02:55.820> bowl

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
and we're gonna transfer this to a bowl

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.540 
and we're gonna transfer this to a bowl
put<00:02:57.920> it<00:02:58.010> right<00:02:58.400> in<00:02:58.730> there<00:02:59.330> you<00:03:00.370> could<00:03:01.370> actually

put it right in there you could actually

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.309 
put it right in there you could actually
use<00:03:01.910> it<00:03:02.090> just<00:03:02.239> like<00:03:02.360> this<00:03:02.600> if<00:03:02.840> you<00:03:02.930> wanted<00:03:03.200> to
