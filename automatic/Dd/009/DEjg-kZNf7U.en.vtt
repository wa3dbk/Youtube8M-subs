00:01:03.779 --> 00:01:03.789 
about and basically do the stuff that

first day arrived with us and with well

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.880 
first day arrived with us and with well
then<00:01:07.360> it's<00:01:07.510> more<00:01:07.720> perhaps<00:01:08.260> thinking<00:01:08.560> about

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
then it's more perhaps thinking about

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.770 
then it's more perhaps thinking about
the<00:01:09.040> long<00:01:09.250> term<00:01:09.310> rather<00:01:09.880> than<00:01:10.150> the<00:01:10.300> short<00:01:10.540> term

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
the long term rather than the short term

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.830 
the long term rather than the short term
yeah<00:01:11.170> I<00:01:11.200> think<00:01:11.320> so<00:01:11.650> I<00:01:11.680> mean<00:01:11.800> II<00:01:11.980> it<00:01:12.310> was<00:01:12.550> a

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
yeah I think so I mean II it was a

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.760 
yeah I think so I mean II it was a
different<00:01:13.840> thing<00:01:13.900> that<00:01:14.200> it<00:01:14.290> picked<00:01:14.470> up<00:01:14.590> last

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
different thing that it picked up last

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.710 
different thing that it picked up last
week<00:01:15.070> to<00:01:15.220> the<00:01:15.310> injury<00:01:15.640> before<00:01:15.790> but<00:01:16.270> we<00:01:16.600> just

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 
week to the injury before but we just

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.000 
week to the injury before but we just
don't<00:01:16.900> want<00:01:17.080> to<00:01:17.140> take<00:01:17.320> a<00:01:17.350> chance<00:01:17.470> you<00:01:17.830> know<00:01:17.860> he

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.010 
don't want to take a chance you know he

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.130 
don't want to take a chance you know he
trained<00:01:18.490> on<00:01:18.670> Thursday<00:01:19.090> and<00:01:19.210> Friday<00:01:19.330> but<00:01:19.750> the

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
that's the only thing that we're

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.059 
that's the only thing that we're
concentrating<00:02:07.570> on<00:02:08.019> and<00:02:08.440> we<00:02:08.560> believe<00:02:08.860> if<00:02:09.039> we

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
concentrating on and we believe if we

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.979 
concentrating on and we believe if we
get<00:02:09.340> the<00:02:09.459> performance<00:02:09.759> right<00:02:10.239> and<00:02:10.509> we<00:02:10.840> think

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
get the performance right and we think

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.430 
get the performance right and we think
that<00:02:11.109> the<00:02:11.319> results<00:02:11.709> are<00:02:11.829> start<00:02:12.099> to<00:02:12.219> follow
