00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.550
 to 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.019
 well let's try to see the 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.750
 influence that has the height at which 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:13.330
 we hit our ball we're going to hit 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:17.080
 I'm going to make 33 different hits 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:19.300
 hitting the opposing ball always on 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.279
 the same place but varying the height to 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.200
 the one that I'm going to hit my ball in the 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:26.169
 first shot I'm going to hit the ball 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.029
 up to the opposite cage we're going to 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:30.470
 hit full and our ball will 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.629
 let's give up 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.760
 then what is produced is a small 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:38.039
 stop and then the two balls come out 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.969
 forward is what we call 

00:00:38.039 --> 00:00:40.969
 stroke of run 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:50.440
 now instead of hitting my ball 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:53.010
 I'm going to hit her at the equator or 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.240
 maybe a tad further down we're going to hit 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.100
 equally full to the opposite ball 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.780
 but instead of giving up as before 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.400
 let's lower the attack point and go 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.530
 to hit at the equator or maybe a 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.080
 little more down doing what 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.660
 We call a matte ball with matte 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.400
 what we get is to stop our 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.090
 ball completely and transmit all the 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.090
 force in the opposite 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.450
 and finally 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.850
 let's give the same amount of ball to 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.870
 ball full but instead of hitting it in the 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.479
 Ecuador I will give you below if 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.970
 we do the blow well we will achieve that 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.270
 our ball challenges in diets can 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.750
 chalk 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:38.660
 in competition we practically give chalk 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.270
 to see if I sell practically all 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.070
 Sometimes we hit the ball below the 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.160
 Ecuador then when our ball 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.840
 collides with the opposite let's say leads 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.670
 rotation backwards when finding a 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.600
 obstacle in front separates a moment and 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.600
 then go back
