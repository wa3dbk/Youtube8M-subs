00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.719 
estate to watch movies or YouTube and
depending<00:01:15.530> on<00:01:15.590> your<00:01:15.680> hand<00:01:15.890> size<00:01:16.130> your<00:01:16.430> thumb

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 
may not get all the way across so it

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:19.660 
may not get all the way across so it
might<00:01:18.530> be<00:01:18.590> difficult<00:01:18.890> for<00:01:19.130> one-handed

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
operation and that may not necessarily

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.929 
operation and that may not necessarily
be<00:01:21.590> a<00:01:21.680> bad<00:01:21.979> thing<00:01:22.009> because<00:01:22.520> the<00:01:22.640> phone<00:01:22.820> is

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
be a bad thing because the phone is

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:24.819 
be a bad thing because the phone is
actually<00:01:23.180> really<00:01:23.390> easy<00:01:23.509> to<00:01:23.899> hold<00:01:24.079> now<00:01:24.619> more

once I got the Nexus 6 I ended up

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.319 
once I got the Nexus 6 I ended up
dumping<00:01:48.710> both<00:01:49.070> of<00:01:49.219> those<00:01:49.369> phones<00:01:49.700> for<00:01:50.180> just

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
this one in my pocket now obviously it's

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.399 
this one in my pocket now obviously it's
bigger<00:01:52.909> so<00:01:53.390> if<00:01:53.509> I<00:01:53.570> couldn't<00:01:53.810> fit<00:01:54.020> that<00:01:54.229> many

great battery life

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.850 
great battery life
which<00:01:58.210> was<00:01:58.360> kind<00:01:58.540> of<00:01:58.720> my<00:01:58.870> anxiety<00:01:59.410> of<00:01:59.530> carrying

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
gonna drain this thing to zero and

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.130 
gonna drain this thing to zero and
that's<00:02:21.910> a<00:02:22.060> really<00:02:22.240> good<00:02:22.450> thing<00:02:22.690> because<00:02:22.720> it's

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
that's a really good thing because it's

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.240 
that's a really good thing because it's
lighter<00:02:23.290> than<00:02:23.470> the<00:02:23.530> size<00:02:23.860> of<00:02:24.040> the<00:02:24.100> battery

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
lighter than the size of the battery

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.580 
lighter than the size of the battery
it's<00:02:24.760> about<00:02:25.000> how<00:02:25.210> the<00:02:25.270> phone<00:02:25.600> actually<00:02:26.080> uses

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
it's about how the phone actually uses

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.770 
it's about how the phone actually uses
it<00:02:26.740> so<00:02:26.920> the<00:02:27.250> Nexus<00:02:27.550> 6<00:02:27.730> is<00:02:27.850> pretty<00:02:28.090> much<00:02:28.210> vanilla

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
it so the Nexus 6 is pretty much vanilla

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.300 
it so the Nexus 6 is pretty much vanilla
Android<00:02:29.140> anyway<00:02:29.560> so<00:02:29.620> there's<00:02:29.860> not<00:02:29.980> much<00:02:30.160> to<00:02:30.280> go

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
Android anyway so there's not much to go

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.730 
Android anyway so there's not much to go
into<00:02:30.459> when<00:02:31.209> it<00:02:31.240> comes<00:02:31.510> to<00:02:31.660> the<00:02:31.750> interface<00:02:32.230> one

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
into when it comes to the interface one

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.380 
into when it comes to the interface one
of<00:02:32.830> the<00:02:32.920> standout<00:02:33.340> things<00:02:33.580> I<00:02:33.730> actually<00:02:33.850> really

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
of the standout things I actually really

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.000 
of the standout things I actually really
love<00:02:34.600> about<00:02:34.690> this<00:02:34.870> phone<00:02:35.050> though<00:02:35.260> is<00:02:35.440> the

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
love about this phone though is the

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.250 
love about this phone though is the
camera<00:02:36.580> now<00:02:37.060> the<00:02:37.150> front-facing<00:02:37.510> camera<00:02:38.080> has<00:02:38.230> a

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
camera now the front-facing camera has a

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.350 
camera now the front-facing camera has a
little<00:02:38.590> bit<00:02:38.680> to<00:02:38.800> be<00:02:38.920> desired<00:02:38.950> but<00:02:39.880> the<00:02:40.030> camera

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
little bit to be desired but the camera

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.300 
little bit to be desired but the camera
on<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:40.630> back<00:02:40.900> is<00:02:41.350> actually<00:02:41.590> really<00:02:42.130> really

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
on the back is actually really really

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.860 
on the back is actually really really
good<00:02:42.610> now<00:02:43.209> the<00:02:43.270> one<00:02:43.510> thing<00:02:43.630> I<00:02:43.720> found

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
good now the one thing I found

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.030 
good now the one thing I found
frustrating<00:02:44.440> especially<00:02:44.500> coming<00:02:44.950> from

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
frustrating especially coming from

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.970 
frustrating especially coming from
devices<00:02:45.430> like<00:02:46.150> the<00:02:46.300> HTC<00:02:46.450> One<00:02:47.080> is<00:02:47.440> the<00:02:47.709> gallery

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
devices like the HTC One is the gallery

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.830 
devices like the HTC One is the gallery
up<00:02:48.280> on<00:02:48.430> here<00:02:48.670> which<00:02:48.880> is<00:02:49.030> not<00:02:49.150> existent<00:02:49.690> so

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
up on here which is not existent so

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.120 
up on here which is not existent so
you're<00:02:49.990> forced<00:02:50.260> to<00:02:50.320> use<00:02:50.440> the<00:02:50.590> Photos<00:02:50.920> app

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
you're forced to use the Photos app

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.490 
you're forced to use the Photos app
which<00:02:51.610> is<00:02:51.910> a<00:02:51.940> little<00:02:52.240> finicky<00:02:52.570> and<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:53.260> photo

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
which is a little finicky and the photo

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.160 
which is a little finicky and the photo
editing<00:02:53.860> features<00:02:54.220> on<00:02:54.340> here<00:02:54.580> are<00:02:54.930> not<00:02:55.930> that

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
editing features on here are not that

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.600 
editing features on here are not that
great<00:02:56.380> so<00:02:56.620> I<00:02:56.709> probably<00:02:56.950> recommend<00:02:57.280> using

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.610 
great so I probably recommend using

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.820 
great so I probably recommend using
Snapseed<00:02:58.300> which<00:02:58.840> has<00:02:59.020> been<00:02:59.200> really<00:02:59.590> really

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
Snapseed which has been really really

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.590 
Snapseed which has been really really
improved<00:03:00.310> recently<00:03:00.730> if<00:03:00.820> you<00:03:00.880> haven't<00:03:01.240> used<00:03:01.390> it

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
improved recently if you haven't used it

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.150 
improved recently if you haven't used it
and<00:03:01.930> again<00:03:02.320> while<00:03:02.500> I<00:03:02.530> can<00:03:02.709> rave<00:03:02.860> about<00:03:02.980> the

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
and again while I can rave about the

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.250 
and again while I can rave about the
camera<00:03:03.430> on<00:03:03.489> the<00:03:03.580> back<00:03:03.610> all<00:03:04.030> day<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.750> camera<00:03:04.989> on

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
camera on the back all day the camera on

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.560 
camera on the back all day the camera on
the<00:03:05.440> front<00:03:05.650> facing<00:03:06.280> you<00:03:06.400> isn't<00:03:07.180> that<00:03:07.330> great

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
the front facing you isn't that great

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.660 
the front facing you isn't that great
the<00:03:07.870> selfie<00:03:08.380> cam<00:03:08.590> over<00:03:08.739> here<00:03:09.130> is<00:03:09.340> just<00:03:09.580> a

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
the selfie cam over here is just a

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.220 
the selfie cam over here is just a
little<00:03:09.880> grainy<00:03:10.180> and<00:03:10.480> it<00:03:10.540> doesn't<00:03:10.810> do<00:03:10.900> well<00:03:11.050> in

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
little grainy and it doesn't do well in

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.050 
little grainy and it doesn't do well in
low<00:03:11.380> light<00:03:11.410> at<00:03:11.739> all<00:03:11.950> so<00:03:12.610> if<00:03:12.670> you're<00:03:12.730> more<00:03:12.850> about

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
low light at all so if you're more about

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.520 
low light at all so if you're more about
taking<00:03:13.360> photos<00:03:13.600> of<00:03:13.690> yourself<00:03:13.780> rather<00:03:14.350> than

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
taking photos of yourself rather than

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.800 
taking photos of yourself rather than
other<00:03:14.739> things<00:03:15.160> I<00:03:15.400> probably<00:03:16.090> recommend<00:03:16.390> a

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
other things I probably recommend a

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:18.960 
other things I probably recommend a
different<00:03:17.440> phone<00:03:17.739> but<00:03:18.280> if<00:03:18.489> you're<00:03:18.610> an<00:03:18.700> amateur

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
different phone but if you're an amateur

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:20.580 
different phone but if you're an amateur
photographer<00:03:19.180> and<00:03:19.930> want<00:03:20.140> something<00:03:20.410> in<00:03:20.500> your

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
photographer and want something in your

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.050 
photographer and want something in your
pocket<00:03:20.920> that<00:03:20.950> can<00:03:21.130> take<00:03:21.280> some<00:03:21.430> great<00:03:21.760> shots

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
pocket that can take some great shots

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.720 
pocket that can take some great shots
this<00:03:22.660> thing<00:03:22.989> takes<00:03:23.500> some<00:03:23.709> awesome<00:03:24.160> ones<00:03:24.340> so

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
this thing takes some awesome ones so

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:25.800 
this thing takes some awesome ones so
the<00:03:24.820> camera<00:03:25.120> on<00:03:25.180> the<00:03:25.269> back<00:03:25.390> will<00:03:25.600> get<00:03:25.690> you

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
the camera on the back will get you

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.080 
the camera on the back will get you
about<00:03:25.930> 13<00:03:26.380> megapixels<00:03:26.980> which<00:03:27.400> is<00:03:27.549> great<00:03:27.880> for

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
about 13 megapixels which is great for

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.400 
about 13 megapixels which is great for
editing<00:03:28.450> photos<00:03:28.810> and<00:03:28.959> getting<00:03:29.140> a<00:03:29.200> lot<00:03:29.350> of

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
editing photos and getting a lot of

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.680 
editing photos and getting a lot of
detail<00:03:29.890> and<00:03:30.130> that<00:03:30.519> 13<00:03:30.910> megapixels<00:03:31.480> is

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
detail and that 13 megapixels is

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:32.740 
detail and that 13 megapixels is
actually<00:03:32.080> a<00:03:32.110> fourth

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
actually a fourth

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.320 
actually a fourth
image<00:03:33.080> so<00:03:33.530> if<00:03:33.680> you<00:03:33.800> see<00:03:33.980> a<00:03:34.010> square<00:03:34.430> photo<00:03:34.760> don't

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
image so if you see a square photo don't

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:36.850 
image so if you see a square photo don't
get<00:03:35.480> too<00:03:35.630> hung<00:03:35.840> up<00:03:35.930> on<00:03:36.110> it<00:03:36.170> now<00:03:36.590> one<00:03:36.710> of<00:03:36.800> the

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
get too hung up on it now one of the

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.590 
get too hung up on it now one of the
surprising<00:03:37.370> features<00:03:37.700> of<00:03:37.850> the<00:03:37.910> Nexus<00:03:38.210> 6<00:03:38.420> is

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
surprising features of the Nexus 6 is

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.690 
surprising features of the Nexus 6 is
the<00:03:38.960> sound<00:03:39.230> system<00:03:39.590> on<00:03:39.680> the<00:03:39.770> front<00:03:39.800> the<00:03:40.370> Nexus

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
the sound system on the front the Nexus

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.310 
the sound system on the front the Nexus
6<00:03:40.880> gives<00:03:41.090> you<00:03:41.180> these<00:03:41.300> two<00:03:41.630> front<00:03:41.960> speakers

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:42.320 
6 gives you these two front speakers

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.170 
6 gives you these two front speakers
here<00:03:42.590> left<00:03:43.040> and<00:03:43.220> right<00:03:43.520> so<00:03:43.670> you<00:03:43.760> get<00:03:43.880> that<00:03:43.970> nice

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
here left and right so you get that nice

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.640 
here left and right so you get that nice
stereo<00:03:44.600> sound<00:03:45.020> when<00:03:45.200> you're<00:03:45.290> watching<00:03:45.440> videos

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
stereo sound when you're watching videos

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.980 
stereo sound when you're watching videos
or<00:03:46.280> movies<00:03:46.670> but<00:03:47.030> the<00:03:47.180> downside<00:03:47.390> is<00:03:47.660> that<00:03:47.810> it's

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:47.990 
or movies but the downside is that it's

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:49.750 
or movies but the downside is that it's
not<00:03:48.200> that<00:03:48.470> loud<00:03:48.740> either<00:03:49.130> in<00:03:49.310> the<00:03:49.370> headphones

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
not that loud either in the headphones

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.760 
not that loud either in the headphones
or<00:03:50.060> on<00:03:50.210> the<00:03:50.300> speakers<00:03:50.690> so<00:03:51.140> if<00:03:51.380> you're<00:03:51.560> really

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:51.770 
or on the speakers so if you're really

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.000 
or on the speakers so if you're really
into<00:03:52.100> loud<00:03:52.430> music<00:03:52.760> or<00:03:53.150> loud<00:03:53.360> audio<00:03:53.830> maybe<00:03:54.830> this

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
into loud music or loud audio maybe this

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.770 
into loud music or loud audio maybe this

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890 
and it is now my daily driver phone so

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.250 
and it is now my daily driver phone so
that<00:04:10.070> says<00:04:10.280> a<00:04:10.310> lot<00:04:10.430> about<00:04:10.940> what<00:04:11.570> I<00:04:11.630> like<00:04:12.020> out<00:04:12.230> of

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
that says a lot about what I like out of

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.440 
that says a lot about what I like out of
a<00:04:12.440> phone<00:04:12.680> but<00:04:13.070> as<00:04:13.160> I<00:04:13.280> mentioned<00:04:13.400> it's<00:04:13.640> not<00:04:13.760> 100%

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
a phone but as I mentioned it's not 100%

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.000 
a phone but as I mentioned it's not 100%
perfect<00:04:14.570> and<00:04:15.050> it<00:04:15.170> has<00:04:15.350> some<00:04:15.650> room<00:04:15.830> for

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
perfect and it has some room for

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.740 
perfect and it has some room for
improvement<00:04:16.070> now<00:04:16.880> as<00:04:17.030> I<00:04:17.180> mentioned<00:04:17.540> this

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
improvement now as I mentioned this

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.509 
improvement now as I mentioned this
phone<00:04:17.900> is<00:04:18.019> new<00:04:18.170> to<00:04:18.290> Verizon<00:04:18.560> and<00:04:19.010> the<00:04:19.250> only

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
phone is new to Verizon and the only

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.490 
phone is new to Verizon and the only
downside<00:04:19.970> I<00:04:20.000> have<00:04:20.269> with<00:04:20.450> that<00:04:20.720> is<00:04:20.989> the<00:04:21.290> fact

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
downside I have with that is the fact

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.740 
downside I have with that is the fact
that<00:04:21.620> it<00:04:21.769> only<00:04:22.010> comes<00:04:22.460> in<00:04:22.730> this<00:04:22.880> one<00:04:23.270> color

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
that it only comes in this one color

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.990 
that it only comes in this one color
which<00:04:24.290> is<00:04:24.470> kind<00:04:24.710> of<00:04:24.740> a<00:04:24.860> dark<00:04:25.070> blue<00:04:25.460> so<00:04:25.910> if

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
which is kind of a dark blue so if

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.500 
which is kind of a dark blue so if
you're<00:04:26.090> not<00:04:26.360> into<00:04:26.720> the<00:04:26.810> darker<00:04:27.140> color<00:04:27.320> phones

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
you're not into the darker color phones
