more undaunted
I<00:01:37.569> decided<00:01:38.289> to<00:01:38.529> try<00:01:38.770> the<00:01:38.829> exact<00:01:39.459> opposite

approach cutting back on my food without

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.169 
approach cutting back on my food without
running<00:01:43.749> my<00:01:44.499> knee<00:01:44.560> hurt<00:01:44.919> anyway<00:01:45.369> so<00:01:45.999> I<00:01:46.029> had

00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:46.179 
running my knee hurt anyway so I had

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:50.069 
running my knee hurt anyway so I had
nothing<00:01:46.329> to<00:01:46.599> lose<00:01:47.549> I'd<00:01:48.549> heard<00:01:48.999> and<00:01:49.270> feared<00:01:49.779> I

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:50.079 
nothing to lose I'd heard and feared I

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:53.159 
nothing to lose I'd heard and feared I
would<00:01:50.649> lose<00:01:50.829> muscle<00:01:51.099> mass<00:01:51.310> not<00:01:52.060> fat<00:01:52.119> if<00:01:52.779> I<00:01:52.929> cut

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:53.169 
would lose muscle mass not fat if I cut

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:55.260 
would lose muscle mass not fat if I cut
back<00:01:53.380> on<00:01:53.619> my<00:01:53.649> food<00:01:53.979> intake<00:01:54.369> and<00:01:54.669> didn't
