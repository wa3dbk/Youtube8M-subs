00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
six grams approaching mechanism module

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.529 
six grams approaching mechanism module
which<00:00:17.220> can<00:00:17.430> be<00:00:17.550> added<00:00:17.789> on<00:00:17.940> any<00:00:18.150> flying

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
which can be added on any flying

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.620 
which can be added on any flying
platform<00:00:18.750> and<00:00:19.320> it<00:00:19.890> enables<00:00:20.369> it<00:00:20.550> to<00:00:20.580> attach<00:00:21.420> two

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
platform and it enables it to attach two

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.660 
platform and it enables it to attach two
different<00:00:21.990> surfaces<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:22.710> detach<00:00:23.160> on<00:00:23.340> command

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
different surfaces and detach on command

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.200 
different surfaces and detach on command
to<00:00:23.910> retake<00:00:24.300> flight<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:25.019> has<00:00:25.320> small<00:00:26.189> arms<00:00:26.640> with

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
to retake flight it has small arms with

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.179 
to retake flight it has small arms with
needles<00:00:27.660> attached<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.529> principle<00:00:29.039> is

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
needles attached and the principle is

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.120 
needles attached and the principle is
that<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.730> platform<00:00:30.630> can<00:00:31.260> fly<00:00:31.560> head<00:00:31.859> first

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
that the platform can fly head first

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.889 
that the platform can fly head first
into<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.550> wall<00:00:32.669> so<00:00:33.059> it<00:00:33.120> does<00:00:33.270> not<00:00:33.300> need<00:00:33.630> to

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
into the wall so it does not need to

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.260 
into the wall so it does not need to
perform<00:00:34.260> any<00:00:34.530> kind<00:00:34.829> of<00:00:34.980> air<00:00:35.550> dynamical

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
perform any kind of air dynamical

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.530 
perform any kind of air dynamical

forest fires which emerge in some places

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.789 
forest fires which emerge in some places
well<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.479> advantage<00:01:18.869> of<00:01:18.990> these<00:01:19.080> mechanism<00:01:19.680> is

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
well the advantage of these mechanism is

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.920 
well the advantage of these mechanism is
that<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.159> is<00:01:20.280> scalable<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:21.240> any<00:01:21.540> kind<00:01:21.720> of

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
that it is scalable so any kind of

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.570 
that it is scalable so any kind of
flying<00:01:22.140> platform<00:01:22.409> could<00:01:22.979> use<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.400> same

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
flying platform could use the same

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.910 
flying platform could use the same
principles<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.390> we<00:01:24.509> implemented<00:01:24.990> here<00:01:25.020> so

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
principles that we implemented here so

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.160 
principles that we implemented here so
bigger<00:01:26.250> one<00:01:26.520> smaller<00:01:26.939> one<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.869> difference

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
bigger one smaller one the difference

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.810 
bigger one smaller one the difference
just<00:01:28.409> using<00:01:28.799> different<00:01:29.189> weights<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.670> the

just using different weights of the

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.340 
just using different weights of the
needles<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.450> different<00:01:30.840> weights<00:01:31.079> of<00:01:31.229> the
