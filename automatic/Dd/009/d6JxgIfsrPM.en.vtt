taillight down you notice that there's a

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.800 
taillight down you notice that there's a
little<00:01:10.729> electrical<00:01:11.210> connector<00:01:11.509> all<00:01:11.630> you<00:01:11.719> have

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
taillight because it's actually shaped

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:22.990 
taillight because it's actually shaped
to<00:01:21.799> only<00:01:21.979> work<00:01:22.250> with<00:01:22.399> this<00:01:22.549> taillight<00:01:22.880> so

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
to only work with this taillight so

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.100 
to only work with this taillight so
that's<00:01:23.149> what<00:01:23.270> those<00:01:23.390> two<00:01:23.600> screws<00:01:23.810> they're

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
that's what those two screws they're

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.959 
that's what those two screws they're
pretty<00:01:24.710> simple<00:01:24.950> pretty<00:01:25.159> straightforward<00:01:25.310> and

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:25.969 
pretty simple pretty straightforward and

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:28.870 
pretty simple pretty straightforward and
then<00:01:26.530> you'll<00:01:27.530> take<00:01:27.710> your<00:01:27.890> new<00:01:28.039> taillight

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
then you'll take your new taillight

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.029 
then you'll take your new taillight
notice<00:01:29.719> it's<00:01:29.869> got<00:01:30.020> the<00:01:30.200> same<00:01:30.380> connect<00:01:30.740> style

00:01:31.029 --> 00:01:31.039 
notice it's got the same connect style

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:32.649 
notice it's got the same connect style
connector<00:01:31.399> on<00:01:31.520> there<00:01:31.729> it<00:01:32.299> basically<00:01:32.539> just

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
connector on there it basically just

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:44.090 
connector on there it basically just
plugs<00:01:33.020> right<00:01:33.170> in<00:01:33.469> place

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.000 

and<00:01:45.100> that<00:01:45.840> that's<00:01:46.840> keyed<00:01:47.230> in<00:01:47.410> one<00:01:47.560> Direction's

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010 
and that that's keyed in one Direction's

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.320 
and that that's keyed in one Direction's
will<00:01:48.160> only<00:01:48.310> go<00:01:48.520> one<00:01:48.700> way<00:01:48.730> but<00:01:48.910> there<00:01:49.210> you<00:01:49.300> go

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
will only go one way but there you go

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:50.970 
will only go one way but there you go
you<00:01:49.480> can<00:01:49.720> kind<00:01:49.900> of<00:01:49.930> see<00:01:50.080> the<00:01:50.230> taillights<00:01:50.470> super

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:50.980 
you can kind of see the taillights super

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:54.150 
you can kind of see the taillights super
bright<00:01:51.160> and<00:01:51.400> then<00:01:51.880> the<00:01:52.000> brake<00:01:52.210> light<00:01:52.420> you<00:01:53.350> set

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 
bright and then the brake light you set
