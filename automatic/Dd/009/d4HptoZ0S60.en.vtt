00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:17.049 
might be the reason this is a little

know and that happened way way too often
that<00:03:40.650> in<00:03:41.650> my<00:03:41.829> opinion<00:03:41.979> is<00:03:42.519> just<00:03:42.879> too<00:03:43.209> much<00:03:43.510> is

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
that in my opinion is just too much is

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.330 
that in my opinion is just too much is
it's<00:03:44.829> too<00:03:45.159> repetitive<00:03:45.609> like<00:03:46.569> I<00:03:47.109> would<00:03:48.069> just

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340

would<00:03:51.310> have<00:03:51.489> a<00:03:51.729> different<00:03:52.500> concept<00:03:53.500> of<00:03:54.629> you

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:55.629 
would have a different concept of you

like the fact you can upgrade upgrading
is<00:04:25.539> really<00:04:25.810> cool<00:04:25.990> your<00:04:26.229> armory<00:04:26.650> your<00:04:26.949> weapons

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.760 

and<00:04:30.740> you<00:04:31.730> know<00:04:31.850> after<00:04:32.030> trying<00:04:32.810> this<00:04:33.020> thrust

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
and you know after trying this thrust

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.890 
and you know after trying this thrust
jumping<00:04:34.280> if<00:04:34.490> maybe<00:04:34.940> it<00:04:35.210> is<00:04:35.390> with<00:04:35.600> what's

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
jumping if maybe it is with what's

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.810 
jumping if maybe it is with what's
called<00:04:36.170> in<00:04:36.410> there<00:04:36.590> in<00:04:36.770> this<00:04:36.920> game<00:04:37.160> boost

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
called in there in this game boost

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.360 
called in there in this game boost
jumping<00:04:38.590> which<00:04:39.590> I<00:04:39.710> think<00:04:39.920> this<00:04:40.010> is<00:04:40.070> going<00:04:40.280> to

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
jumping which I think this is going to

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:41.920 
jumping which I think this is going to
be<00:04:40.490> very<00:04:40.610> similar<00:04:40.940> what's<00:04:41.240> gonna<00:04:41.360> be<00:04:41.570> in<00:04:41.600> black

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
be very similar what's gonna be in black

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.310 
be very similar what's gonna be in black
ops<00:04:42.110> 3<00:04:42.230> I<00:04:42.790> mean<00:04:43.790> it's<00:04:44.060> a<00:04:44.180> cool<00:04:44.390> it's<00:04:44.900> cool<00:04:44.990> to

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
ops 3 I mean it's a cool it's cool to

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.350 
ops 3 I mean it's a cool it's cool to
have<00:04:45.350> it<00:04:45.650> but<00:04:46.010> I<00:04:46.040> think<00:04:46.100> there's<00:04:46.460> one<00:04:46.520> mechanic

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
have it but I think there's one mechanic

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.930 
have it but I think there's one mechanic
missing<00:04:47.810> in<00:04:47.960> this<00:04:48.080> game<00:04:48.350> and<00:04:48.620> it's<00:04:49.550> like<00:04:49.760> when

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
missing in this game and it's like when

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.420 
missing in this game and it's like when
you're<00:04:50.090> fighting<00:04:50.390> against<00:04:51.230> enemies<00:04:51.650> a<00:04:51.920> lot<00:04:52.310> of

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
you're fighting against enemies a lot of

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.730 
you're fighting against enemies a lot of
times<00:04:52.640> you<00:04:52.760> want<00:04:52.910> to<00:04:53.030> dodge<00:04:53.210> those<00:04:53.930> lasers<00:04:54.500> or

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
times you want to dodge those lasers or

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.920 
times you want to dodge those lasers or
whatever<00:04:55.130> they're<00:04:55.310> shooting<00:04:55.640> at<00:04:55.730> you<00:04:55.850> and<00:04:56.330> I

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
whatever they're shooting at you and I

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.310 
whatever they're shooting at you and I
think<00:04:58.030> strafing<00:04:59.030> if<00:04:59.540> that's<00:04:59.840> what's<00:05:00.080> called

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
think strafing if that's what's called

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.770 
think strafing if that's what's called
from<00:05:00.640> advanced<00:05:01.640> warfare<00:05:01.760> like<00:05:02.270> where<00:05:02.450> you<00:05:02.600> can

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
from advanced warfare like where you can

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.830 
from advanced warfare like where you can
boost<00:05:03.050> side<00:05:03.500> to<00:05:03.710> side<00:05:03.920> I<00:05:04.390> think<00:05:05.390> that<00:05:05.630> is

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
boost side to side I think that is

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.300 
boost side to side I think that is
missing<00:05:06.200> in<00:05:06.290> this<00:05:06.410> game<00:05:06.650> I<00:05:06.680> think<00:05:06.830> if<00:05:07.100> they

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 
missing in this game I think if they

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:09.370 
missing in this game I think if they
would<00:05:07.490> have<00:05:07.520> that<00:05:07.940> it<00:05:08.390> would<00:05:08.540> be<00:05:08.690> way<00:05:08.990> way<00:05:09.350> more

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
would have that it would be way way more

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.710 
would have that it would be way way more
fun<00:05:09.980> and<00:05:10.250> more<00:05:10.280> maybe<00:05:11.150> a<00:05:11.240> little<00:05:11.420> bit<00:05:11.570> more

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 
fun and more maybe a little bit more

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.560 
fun and more maybe a little bit more
easier<00:05:12.140> but<00:05:12.680> it<00:05:12.980> would<00:05:13.130> be<00:05:13.280> better<00:05:13.940> in<00:05:14.270> my

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
easier but it would be better in my

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.690 
easier but it would be better in my
opinion<00:05:14.740> but<00:05:15.740> so<00:05:15.920> far<00:05:16.160> I'm<00:05:16.280> enjoying<00:05:16.370> this

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:16.700 
opinion but so far I'm enjoying this

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.630 
opinion but so far I'm enjoying this
game<00:05:17.000> and<00:05:17.840> if<00:05:18.710> you<00:05:18.860> guys<00:05:18.980> are<00:05:19.160> a<00:05:19.190> destiny
