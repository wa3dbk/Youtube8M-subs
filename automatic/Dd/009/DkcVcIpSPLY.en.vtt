00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.649
 Nine people today I'll show you the 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:09.649
 fans ifans and use file storage mode 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.550
 so as we start it out with the 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.680
 crash crafting recipe for the fans 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.890
 fans and that's just even six 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.020
 blocks are not different 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.149
 blocks but from the individual eg 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.930
 six breaks in a row and then 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.579
 you get as offensive as you can 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.320
 looks here you see how such a 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.379
 small wall 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:47.489
 that's the first time a pillar is connected 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.859
 it becomes a wall and I think 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.749
 This really cool and like me 

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:53.550
 that got in the last photos 

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:57.539
 I think they are synonymous in the version 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.329
 1.4 can be introduced and with it you can 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.679
 then so small columns what then already 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.239
 kind of cool looks to his homes 

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:05.309
 attach as I have done here 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.260
 or simply somehow so one 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.740
 build fence around a field like mine now 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:17.510
 have done here and yes the 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:19.860
 of course also connect with each other and 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.450
 and then you can do it easily 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.190
 beautify his houses was such a 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.930
 pillar looks cool anyway somehow 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:29.220
 build a sand temple and so and yes 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.890
 that the rest is up to you then 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.860
 what to do with these fans fans it hires 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.130
 the second is the second mod 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.070
 useful storage offered the jusos storage mod 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.730
 and the mods are the same 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.400
 manufacturer and this mod 53 new blocks 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:50.340
 actually added four new blocks and 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:53.430
 though the wheat blog the kohleblock and 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:57.050
 the red to the blog I have of course 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.050
 quite well prepared here 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:08.130
 these are gone now 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:11.970
 that can not be done so the alcohol 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:15.870
 and the wheat blog yes how to look 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.840
 So coal blocks can think so 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:22.500
 charcoal carbon blocks are just charcoal 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.510
 blocks and the normal coal block 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.440
 Seen a bit different from I have 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.440
 just a pickaxe 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.349
 because then if you then strikes again 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:45.150
 we need this for a long time 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:47.250
 the wood walls / if that with an okay 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.810
 that does have the wood sound but will 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:54.180
 I do not think any calls are broken and 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.860
 somehow get well if you then 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.269
 again, of course, then you get the 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:02.190
 block again to see the white blocks 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:04.620
 as I think this is really cool 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.150
 of course they just come that way 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.420
 you do not need anything special 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.120
 for and that looks pretty resourceful though 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.159
 it is so behind his wheat field 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.799
 or as wrong as I am here 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:20.040
 and then there's the 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:22.620
 redstone block and this one stops 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.220
 also cool and enlightened when he is 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.599
 With redstone activated where is there 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.569
 Enlightened be activated with redstone 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:34.019
 So the leader is the leader 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.730
 I do not think so but that shines and 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:39.510
 what is this here yes that is one 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:42.540
 scarecrow there and this one is out 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.560
 wheat blocks and a pumpkin fortified 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.389
 and that we are so horny 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.329
 scarecrow that looks really cool 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:53.370
 and what is the feature of the 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:57.120
 Scarecrow will not be anymore 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.799
 They run to their fields because they run 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.129
 Look at scarecrow plant like this 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:01.129
 can 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:08.120
 we change very fast in all directions 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:12.790
 away from the scarecrow and bio that 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:15.080
 It was from the new shoes storage and 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:18.220
 TV fans brave now shows fast 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.220
 how to install these 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.850
 on the north side you can see that 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.210
 modder also provide many others 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:28.370
 mozart among other things the blogs murder and 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:31.220
 the mythical kay I will put tomorrow 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:34.220
 or the day before tomorrow and here first on 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.169
 chelsea fans are down here and up 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.880
 useful storage is down here 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:40.970
 you need the risotto for that 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:43.490
 or had the files but then from 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:47.060
 desktop you go first in percent from there 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:56.990
 Since percent is missing the percent sign 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:58.669
 and percent from tata percent so then goes 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.349
 on minecraft and then you are 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:08.530
 already at minecraft folder then goes on 

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:12.020
 So I'm minecraft with winrar and 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.330
 opens first in the motto or pulls all 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.970
 files of the 1 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:19.220
 then he leaves the tenant in folder and 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:26.289
 then you open, for example, useful 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:26.289
 storage and pulls all the files in there 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:33.509
 so then if there are fans and here 

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:36.240
 for example, compatibility pack for 

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:37.590
 better blogs and items so one of them 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.840
 place of the mug's blogs 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:41.759
 old there had to be when the leaves blogs 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.680
 are ailtons installed that too 

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:44.910
 Add but that explains too 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.520
 probably during the installation of 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:49.860
 better box set items so if you have the 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.050
 weather box with old swatch installed 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.840
 simply pulls her that these files 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:57.960
 still with pure and otherwise simply the 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:01.259
 files and you have the two 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.039
 mods installed yes and that was it now 

00:06:01.259 --> 00:06:04.979
 actually already 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:07.759
 I hope you enjoyed it a lot 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:07.759
 with it and ciao
