00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
rosewood you see in this wood before on

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.179 
rosewood you see in this wood before on
my<00:01:23.939> channel<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.420> used<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.840> before<00:01:24.979> with<00:01:25.979> those

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
my channel I used it before with those

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.219 
my channel I used it before with those
natural<00:01:26.400> bolsters<00:01:27.119> it<00:01:27.240> was<00:01:27.360> cross<00:01:27.659> grain<00:01:27.869> cut

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
natural bolsters it was cross grain cut

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.539 
natural bolsters it was cross grain cut
different<00:01:28.619> way<00:01:28.740> you<00:01:28.799> know<00:01:28.920> grandma's<00:01:29.400> going

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
different way you know grandma's going

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.969 
different way you know grandma's going
this<00:01:29.790> way<00:01:30.000> on<00:01:30.210> angle<00:01:30.630> so<00:01:31.439> this<00:01:31.650> is<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.799> regular

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
this way on angle so this is the regular

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.060 
this way on angle so this is the regular
grain<00:01:32.579> when<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.299> comes<00:01:33.540> this<00:01:33.750> way<00:01:33.990> like<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:35.009> a

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
grain when it comes this way like it a

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.819 
grain when it comes this way like it a
lot<00:01:35.479> actually<00:01:36.479> if<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:36.750> if<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:37.470> would<00:01:37.590> look

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
lot actually if you if you would look

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.219 
lot actually if you if you would look
this<00:01:38.130> way<00:01:38.430> for<00:01:39.030> some<00:01:39.299> reason<00:01:39.869> I<00:01:39.960> don't<00:01:40.020> know

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
this way for some reason I don't know

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.620 
this way for some reason I don't know
why<00:01:40.439> is<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.740> actually<00:01:41.340> it<00:01:41.909> looks<00:01:42.299> like<00:01:42.450> it's

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
why is that actually it looks like it's

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.569 
why is that actually it looks like it's
kind<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:42.840> like<00:01:42.930> book<00:01:43.200> matched<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:44.220> grain<00:01:44.549> of

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
kind of like book matched the grain of

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.630 
kind of like book matched the grain of
the<00:01:44.850> wood<00:01:45.030> goes<00:01:45.810> also<00:01:46.079> on<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.409> angle<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:46.920> it's

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
the wood goes also on the angle and it's

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.850 
the wood goes also on the angle and it's
it's<00:01:48.030> pretty<00:01:48.299> much<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.450> same<00:01:48.869> on<00:01:49.140> both<00:01:49.229> sides

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
it's pretty much the same on both sides

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.350 
it's pretty much the same on both sides
it's<00:01:50.100> probably<00:01:50.520> hard<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.790> see<00:01:51.030> on<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.240> video

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
it's probably hard to see on the video

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.840 
it's probably hard to see on the video
but<00:01:52.200> actually<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.619> lines<00:01:52.829> here<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.579> way<00:01:53.700> they

without cooling it kind of burns the

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.200 
without cooling it kind of burns the

perfectly clean yet you see this little
flat<00:03:45.120> fled<00:03:45.840> here<00:03:46.110> but<00:03:46.740> I'm<00:03:46.830> thinking<00:03:47.220> about

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
doing that maybe I think it would work

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.949 
doing that maybe I think it would work
well<00:03:49.250> not<00:03:50.250> sure<00:03:50.490> how<00:03:50.730> it's<00:03:51.270> going<00:03:51.450> to<00:03:51.510> be<00:03:51.630> to<00:03:51.810> do

well not sure how it's going to be to do
that<00:03:52.140> in<00:03:52.290> that<00:03:52.440> would<00:03:52.709> because<00:03:53.340> that's<00:03:53.550> what<00:03:53.670> I

that in that would because that's what I

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.310 
that in that would because that's what I

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
to be the last buoy for a while I did

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.409 
to be the last buoy for a while I did
three<00:05:04.620> of<00:05:04.740> them<00:05:04.889> already<00:05:05.070> which<00:05:05.850> is<00:05:05.970> planning

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:07.949 
so I'm going to go back to the different

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:09.800 
so I'm going to go back to the different
shapes<00:05:08.190> this<00:05:08.639> doesn't<00:05:08.850> have<00:05:09.000> an<00:05:09.210> edge<00:05:09.330> on<00:05:09.570> I

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
shapes this doesn't have an edge on I

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.170 
shapes this doesn't have an edge on I
think<00:05:10.169> I<00:05:10.260> put<00:05:10.470> the<00:05:10.620> edge<00:05:10.800> on<00:05:11.039> when<00:05:11.669> when<00:05:12.000> it's

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
think I put the edge on when when it's

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.610 
think I put the edge on when when it's
all<00:05:12.510> done<00:05:12.620> after<00:05:13.620> the<00:05:13.979> shit<00:05:14.870> I'm<00:05:15.870> thinking
