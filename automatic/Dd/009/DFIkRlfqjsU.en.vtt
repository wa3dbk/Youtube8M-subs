00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.140 
how to make the lamp all right to make
the<00:02:12.330> lamp<00:02:12.540> I<00:02:12.840> used<00:02:13.349> a<00:02:13.650> 2<00:02:13.980> by<00:02:14.129> 2<00:02:14.160> for<00:02:14.610> a<00:02:14.640> base<00:02:14.879> but

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
the lamp I used a 2 by 2 for a base but

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.240 
the lamp I used a 2 by 2 for a base but
you<00:02:15.269> can<00:02:15.450> use<00:02:15.599> anything<00:02:15.900> you<00:02:16.080> want<00:02:16.349> and<00:02:16.590> then<00:02:16.680> I

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
you can use anything you want and then I

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.220 
you can use anything you want and then I
took<00:02:17.400> four<00:02:18.030> of<00:02:18.060> these<00:02:18.569> cone<00:02:19.430> Lego<00:02:20.430> elements

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230 
took four of these cone Lego elements

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:27.110 
took four of these cone Lego elements
like<00:02:22.230> that<00:02:22.440> and<00:02:23.030> then<00:02:24.030> I<00:02:24.269> took<00:02:24.920> this<00:02:25.920> flat<00:02:26.640> or

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
like that and then I took this flat or

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.910 
like that and then I took this flat or
flat<00:02:27.989> round<00:02:28.380> two<00:02:29.190> by<00:02:29.370> two<00:02:30.319> set<00:02:31.319> it<00:02:31.470> there<00:02:31.530> and

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
flat round two by two set it there and

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.120 
flat round two by two set it there and
then<00:02:32.000> I<00:02:33.000> took<00:02:33.060> three<00:02:33.569> studs<00:02:34.019> I<00:02:34.380> used<00:02:34.799> yellow

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
then I took three studs I used yellow

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.100 
then I took three studs I used yellow
ones<00:02:35.400> to<00:02:35.670> make<00:02:35.790> it<00:02:35.910> look<00:02:35.970> like<00:02:36.030> an<00:02:36.329> out<00:02:36.599> lamp

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
ones to make it look like an out lamp

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.490 
ones to make it look like an out lamp
and<00:02:37.410> then<00:02:38.370> you<00:02:38.579> just<00:02:38.760> take<00:02:38.970> this<00:02:39.090> round

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
and then you just take this round

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.259 
and then you just take this round
elements<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:40.799> put<00:02:41.069> it<00:02:41.160> on<00:02:41.280> top<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:41.790> that's

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
elements and put it on top and that's

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.690 
elements and put it on top and that's
how<00:02:42.510> you<00:02:42.569> make<00:02:42.840> her<00:02:43.260> lamp<00:02:43.530> so<00:02:44.190> this<00:02:44.400> is<00:02:44.430> how<00:02:44.670> you
