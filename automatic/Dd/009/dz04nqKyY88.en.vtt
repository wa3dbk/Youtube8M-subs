00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:12.330
 the girl today the neighbor is going to be about 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.429
 free and thats my last purchases 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.920
 I do not know if you have already realized by my 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.920
 Last video but I'm out of control 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.080
 When they are books, I went for a walk in the 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.720
 Bookstore I love the back in the book I guess 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.000
 which is so relaxing and I went to give a 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.740
 looked at the books I had and my 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.850
 Ready to see if you find the books 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.809
 that I had placed did not exist and I 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.880
 I was crazy 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.860
 On that day I leave with five books from 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.700
 bookstore and I got home I bought 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.559
 a few more 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.300
 I searched the store there myself and I 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.309
 I realized that there were several books I 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.710
 I wish that on the internet they were with 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.020
 discount then when I got home I 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.700
 I finished to buy what I wanted 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.440
 I'll show you now I'm not going 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.239
 talk a lot I think I will not talk 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.420
 nothing of his history I 'm just going to show 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.210
 the letters because there is a lot of books I go 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.430
 do the same as the other 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.910
 I'll put all the eggs one by one in 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.910
 on top of the other 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:19.979
 You have a lot of books here. 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:23.369
 I think it's two days of shopping. 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:26.369
 Good. Let's start that day at the bookstore. 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:30.420
 the ones I bought on that day that I went 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:35.220
 There were five books as I said that 5 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:38.490
 and I bought the second and third books 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.590
 of series 6 ana euler in the second 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.939
 are three books is a technology already gave 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.130
 The first one I think I do not know for you 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.659
 in the latest book shopping video 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.090
 So I bought second and third 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.619
 because he had already released the two and gave 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.840
 I bought it at one time because as soon as 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.740
 finish the second already starts the third 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.600
 I also bought the second book and if 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.630
 the pandemonium that is the second book of 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.280
 according to legend of the series delirium that already 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.079
 gave the first is the second has a 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.429
 third, the third only has 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:10.560
 hard cover and I'll wait to be able to 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.500
 buy it with the soft cover so the 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:17.070
 paper beck to stay the same three 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.620
 is to cover to confess I already nor the third 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.560
 in book but I do not understand the book 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.940
 I'll buy a physical one year from now. 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.280
 I'll make a separate video later. 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.010
 telling what I found from the series 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.290
 another book that I bought is the 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:37.530
 it's the series 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:41.459
 so sick I think just having the Sixers and this 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.680
 here is the same writer 12 mortals who 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.180
 I also made you a video for you the 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.670
 my last books that I had more 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.209
 I liked it in 2012 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:56.400
 was in 2012 and I also bought the book 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:03:00.510
 selection is the selection that is a 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:03.630
 technology and soon after it also 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.459
 one day i devoured this book i loved this 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.900
 book and then I'm going to make a video 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.540
 also talking about it 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.980
 As soon as I got this book I went 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.170
 look on the internet had not yet 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.900
 released the second book but I do not think 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.450
 I'm a week later I do not know and I went 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.970
 running the day he released the book I 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.840
 I bought the second book I 've read and he 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.049
 also 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.510
 now the other two are boxes that I've already 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:30.239
 I read the first book of each of them but 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.910
 I had read one of them this year in book 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.340
 and another already had the first book but 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:38.489
 I found the internet on sale 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.019
 first of them is the house of night 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.420
 I already showed the first book that the 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:45.030
 marketing had already shown you 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.769
 I already read he did a research and I realized 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.959
 that if I counted on boxing with the 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.730
 four first books in the series and this 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.829
 It's cheaper for me than if I 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.660
 buy the other three separate 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:57.060
 so I ended up buying boxing now I have 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.459
 two of the first but I do not know if I 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.290
 I'll give it away though I 'll sell it now. 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.420
 also because of the magnificent 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.650
 cute little boxing and I think the 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.880
 other books 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:11.160
 I do not know if it 's from the belt until the eighth five 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:12.930
 until the ninth but I think there are ten books 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.760
 so one of them is not part of the box 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.950
 When you finish reading, this is your kiss. 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.079
 if a new boston comes out, otherwise I will not have 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.880
 who buy one of them and stop 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:23.700
 I already gave the first one already told you 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.900
 I think about it from here besides seeing in 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:29.970
 a box 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:32.190
 cutie has no post not only ever 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.289
 I was a poster fan I did not put it in my 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:42.960
 home in my room 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:46.020
 It's not very beautiful, but it's fulfilled. 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.810
 will be saved in boxing a goal 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:52.889
 nowhere even 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:55.560
 and the other is a series that I also loved 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:58.710
 I read the first book I fell in love 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:01.260
 by the limbo series that this first book 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:03.630
 hence I bought boxing still in the bookstore 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.430
 to buy the book 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:08.610
 The first book I have in my book. 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:10.770
 So I saw boxing there hidden. 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.110
 I saw arrested at the time I joined the cell phone. 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.850
 I even went to their website and I saw that 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:17.370
 It was much cheaper so I came in 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.919
 home I bought boxing on the internet what? 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:22.830
 when good is called the instruments 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:24.870
 mortals that if I do not mistake I will leave 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.660
 the first free movie that year 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.610
 now I do not remember if it's five six 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:32.310
 books but I have a boxer with 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:35.220
 the first four that we have had 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:40.229
 good and it 's the first one I've read is serious 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:41.639
 ash only fillet is son or fallen angels 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:44.430
 those were my last campaigns 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:46.830
 from the book as you realized I am 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:49.080
 kind of crazy when it comes to buying books if 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:52.440
 there's one thing I awry me is 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:55.050
 book is a bookstore girl I get 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.400
 2010 the hand begins to be in doubt must 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:58.800
 be for the two of them after 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:01.639
 choice I'll walk while more 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:04.800
 books arrive on time I can not decide 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:07.380
 so on Sunday when you leave with five 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:11.220
 bookstore books - this is difficult 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:14.639
 This day I bought the elite that is the 

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:16.800
 second book in the selection series is me 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:18.539
 be there only with this one because I was lacking 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.620
 with me and I also had 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:21.419
 consciousness that I had just 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:30.510
 buy a lot of books on the 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:36.570
 confused forum 12345678 with precatórios 

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:37.529
 books and the 14 books I jolie 34 and 41 

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:40.439
 10 missing 

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:42.299
 the age at forum 4 is not because it has the 

00:06:40.439 --> 00:06:45.149
 the first two of the box I've already mentioned 

00:06:42.299 --> 00:06:47.669
 so in fact there were 648 books 

00:06:45.149 --> 00:06:49.829
 problem then that's it then I make one 

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:53.099
 video prepared telling what I found 

00:06:49.829 --> 00:06:54.659
 of the other books and who had only 

00:06:53.099 --> 00:06:56.669
 books do not forget to leave a 

00:06:54.659 --> 00:06:58.859
 comment here on youtube or blog 

00:06:56.669 --> 00:07:03.169
 odor when looking for books that reads 

00:06:58.859 --> 00:07:03.169
 Until the test, bye, bye.
