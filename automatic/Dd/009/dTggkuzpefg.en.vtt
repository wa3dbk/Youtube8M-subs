going to be more lively and talk with a
little<00:00:31.380> more<00:00:31.529> tests<00:00:33.649> so<00:00:34.649> my<00:00:34.920> code<00:00:35.460> name<00:00:35.670> this

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
little more tests so my code name this

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.470 
little more tests so my code name this
time<00:00:36.000> will<00:00:36.570> be<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:37.520> guess<00:00:38.520> I'm<00:00:38.910> going<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.270> stick

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
time will be I guess I'm going to stick

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.139 
time will be I guess I'm going to stick
with<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:40.190> let<00:00:41.190> me<00:00:41.309> turn<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.640> sound<00:00:41.850> down<00:00:42.000> a

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
with the let me turn the sound down a

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.279 
with the let me turn the sound down a
little<00:00:42.360> bit<00:00:44.239> before<00:00:45.239> we<00:00:45.270> start<00:00:45.690> this<00:00:45.870> kidding

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
little bit before we start this kidding

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.110 
little bit before we start this kidding
yeah<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:46.739> keep<00:00:47.039> doing<00:00:47.250> this<00:00:47.550> thinking<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:48.030> the

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
yeah I keep doing this thinking that the

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.910 
yeah I keep doing this thinking that the
sound<00:00:48.390> needs<00:00:48.600> turning<00:00:49.020> down<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.500> doesn't

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
sound needs turning down and it doesn't

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.209 
sound needs turning down and it doesn't

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
um but no yes oh my code this time is

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.619
