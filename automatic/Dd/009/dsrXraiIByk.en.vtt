00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:11.230

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:16.900

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.539
 garlic and a full set of five which 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:26.009
 usually used for cooking 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:29.050
 Asian food meaning sesame seeds 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:30.220
 ginger with the right to go out and chinese 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.040
 seasoning a little 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:36.730
 ground coriander black ground pepper 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.550
 sesame oil soy sauce and vinegar i 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:42.999
 I will use natural apple 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.739
 some vegetable oil and sugar 

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:49.010
 let's start with a little bit of starch 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:51.949
 noodles we will boil water and better cut 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:01:02.180
 immediately so that later it was convenient to eat on 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:01:05.269
 small pieces of chopped noodles 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:08.860
 pour boiling water and leave it for minutes 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.860
 by five for swelling 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.899
 until we cut the onions and rub the carrots 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:20.270
 here such slices need to cut onions 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.439
 carrot need to rub straw noodles 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.540
 already worn out 

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:25.670
 and water from it must be drained through a colander 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.630
 now we make onions and carrots 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.630
 salad dressing 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:35.300
 fry slightly in vegetable oil 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:41.330
 onions even fry and therefore we his 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:43.740
 just become softer add carrots 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:50.640
 turn off the fire and carrots too lightly 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:53.690
 pass it all you do not need to fry 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.690
 rollback quotes 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.870
 you can shoot a diving course volume in 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.420

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.100
 all products are prepared again 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.400
 I repeat that I had already cabbage 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.830

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:21.140

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.270

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.520
 asian is added all by eye give 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:54.890
 We add to our taste first 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:57.670
 all by a little bit and then bring the taste to 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.870
 taste that you like exactly 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.440

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.480
 someone sweeter 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.959
 All that seasoning is added 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.520

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:13.250

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.959

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.740
 love it seasoning it 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:21.200
 flavor enhancer can do without it 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:27.400
 add a little seasoning 7 itself is not enough 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:27.400
