00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:19.460
 the Gabonese republic extends 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.080
 about 270 thousand square kilometers and 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.109
 has many resources 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.830
 natural it bears the nickname of country 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:26.830
 from their glass 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.250
 port-nice second oil city 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.000
 largest city of Gabon has the 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.000
 largest port of the country 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.010
 the Atlantic Ocean embraces the city of 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.900
 nice port to the north and west to the east 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.600
 is the nature reserve area 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.880
 wonga wongu you south east is 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.410
 the estuary of the ogooué river whose 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.150
 swampy land and if you 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.160
 span hundreds of 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.379
 kilometers preventing the connection between 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:01.360
 nice port and the road network of 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:03.519
 the interior of the country because of its layout 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.510
 ambitious and features of the 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:06.400
 under ground 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.170
 the construction of the nice harbor road 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.450
 in the end and is a real challenge 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.130
 technical and should eventually allow 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.420
 connect the city to the road network 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:18.220
 national for a long time the boat and 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.220
 the plane were the only ways to 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.140
 transport for the inhabitants 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.210
 the construction of the nice harbor road 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.810
 in the end and so is a regional issue 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.810
 major 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.280
 the road will follow the west coast of Gabon 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.119
 it will cross the swamps of 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.710
 the estuary of the ogooué river and the 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.710
 mouth of the lagoon n committed 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.430
 two impressive decks of a length 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:52.790
 cumulative of about 9000 300 meters are at 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.500
 build once realized they will 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.880
 respectively the third and 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.770
 fourth largest bridge in africa 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.600
 the work is difficult because the 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.850
 construction site and located in a 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.710
 sedimentation area if they shut up and 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:11.360
 that the length of foundations on piles 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:13.400
 dupont exceeds 60 meters in order to leave 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.500
 the free passage to ships the spans 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.360
 main bridge will be built 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.080
 using concrete box girders 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:24.530
 prestressed 65 cents 20 and 65 meters 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.180
 long the other works will 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.250
 made by means of concrete beams 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.790
 prestressed 30 meters long 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.790
 each 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.230
 the road runs parallel to the coast 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.640
 atlantic and the work is done 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.550
 basically in swampy area and 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.650
 sandy the conditions of 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:47.000
 construction are so much more 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.180
 complicated than that of a road 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.180
 ordinary 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.230
 wiser of advanced technologies will be 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.650
 necessary on certain parts of the 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.650
 course 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:05.499
 depending on the nature of the soil 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:11.909
 swampy meet technologies 

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:11.909
 following will be used stone lost 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.349
 and piles of cement and mixed earth 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:29.960
 piles of gravel will be used 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.640
 in areas of spongy sand it 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.470
 there is no place of land loan 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.860
 and no career on the whole 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.630
 trace 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.700
 building materials 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:42.530
 necessary to be transported on 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:44.510
 more than 350 km the sylt being the 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.070
 along the road will be used to 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:50.050
 fill the solid ground which both 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.050
 sides will be protected with clay 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.870
 the starting point of the new road 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.320
 is located in brega 22 km south of port 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.420
 nice 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.640
 it will be connected to this place at the 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.910
 port-gentil road mandorové by aaron 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.910
 points 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:13.560
 the road is heading south and 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.040
 through a mangrove area and 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.040
 swampy land 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.760
 it then crosses the estuary of 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.550
 the ogooué the largest river of Gabon 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.620
 by means of a big bridge of 4700 meters 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.919
 long crossing the different arms 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.919
 of the river 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.720
 at 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:39.970
 by its simple lines and generous the 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.270
 bridge spans logo is like a bow in 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.270
 sky 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.610
 the road continues through an area 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:56.580
 if he spongy you along the region 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.680
 coast and once again crosses 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.520
 mangroves and wetlands in 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.520
 south direction 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:11.410
 the mouth of the lagoon n as there is 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:14.080
 crossed by using another very big 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:19.750
 bridge whose total length is 4500 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:21.670
 70 m once completed the bridge on 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:23.440
 Ogooué and bridge over the lagoon n 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:27.480
 clerk will become two books 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.480
 emblematic of the west coast of Gabon 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.920
 continuing south the road 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:38.060
 crosses the area if you and the field 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.060
 oil of bremen 

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:46.150
 she finds her point of arrival at two 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.010
 kilometers to the south we were playing under the 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.260
 form of a roundabout connecting it to the 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:53.460
 road leading to the city of hamburg as well 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:56.770
 than at the future road leading to yong said 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:59.530
 the total length of the road and 93 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:01.450
 km an extension phase towards 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:05.640
 the east should then allow the 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:05.640
 connection to the national road number one 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.440
 this project will allow the realization of 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.510
 dream that feeds for 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.470
 decades the Gabonese people and the 

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:37.750
 local businesses 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:40.120
 to see the conditions improve 

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:41.470
 nice port transport the new 

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.060
 road will allow better 

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:43.660
 movement of people and 

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.669
 merchandise 

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:48.100
 giving a considerable boost 

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:50.160
 economic and social development of 

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.160
 country 

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:56.880
 his Excellency the President of 

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:59.160
 the Gabonese Republic ali bongo 

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:01.710
 ondimba has personally committed 

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:05.490
 for a quick realization of this 

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:09.620
 ambitious project mobility is one 

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:09.620
 foundations of the emergence of Gabon
