hey<00:00:17.970> that<00:00:18.660> looks<00:00:18.840> absolutely<00:00:19.289> playable<00:00:20.100> even

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
hey that looks absolutely playable even

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:27.589 
hey that looks absolutely playable even
if<00:00:20.730> it<00:00:20.820> does<00:00:21.000> have<00:00:21.180> no<00:00:21.359> creatures<00:00:26.210> so<00:00:27.210> he<00:00:27.330> plays

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
if it does have no creatures so he plays

a<00:00:27.630> swamp<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.529> we're<00:00:29.099> off<00:00:29.250> ok<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.240> guess<00:00:30.810> will

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
a swamp and we're off ok I guess will

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.630 
a swamp and we're off ok I guess will
lead<00:00:31.230> off<00:00:31.410> with<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.800> Shinka<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.730> say<00:00:33.450> go

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
lead off with the Shinka and say go

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.960 
lead off with the Shinka and say go

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
at this point we're probably looking for

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.340 
at this point we're probably looking for
dropping<00:00:38.970> the<00:00:39.000> guildmage<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:40.020> then<00:00:40.140> either

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
dropping the guildmage and then either

whatever they're dropping and scary or

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.180 
whatever they're dropping and scary or
using<00:00:45.059> phyrexian<00:00:45.329> arena<00:00:46.010> obviously<00:00:47.010> they're

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
using phyrexian arena obviously they're

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.639 
using phyrexian arena obviously they're
going<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.640> burn<00:00:47.790> round<00:00:48.180> so<00:00:49.020> we<00:00:49.050> get<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.470> deal

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
going to burn round so we get to deal

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.970 
going to burn round so we get to deal
with<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:50.510> but<00:00:51.510> let's<00:00:51.839> just<00:00:51.960> draw<00:00:52.350> out<00:00:52.530> said

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
with that but let's just draw out said

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.060 
with that but let's just draw out said
burn<00:00:54.019> and<00:00:55.019> I<00:00:55.079> just<00:00:55.290> realized<00:00:55.650> it<00:00:55.800> in<00:00:55.920> Nam

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
burn and I just realized it in Nam

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.200 
burn and I just realized it in Nam
enough<00:00:56.280> metaphor<00:00:56.760> for<00:00:56.910> X<00:00:57.150> in<00:00:57.269> arena<00:00:59.120> but<00:01:00.120> I

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
enough metaphor for X in arena but I

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.430 
enough metaphor for X in arena but I
will<00:01:00.420> have<00:01:00.570> enough<00:01:00.750> mana<00:01:00.960> for<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.199> crop

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440
