first time you launch the app if it's

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.350 
first time you launch the app if it's
not<00:00:47.039> already<00:00:47.250> running<00:00:47.579> in<00:00:47.730> memory<00:00:48.030> it's<00:00:48.210> going

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
not already running in memory it's going

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.330 
not already running in memory it's going
to<00:00:48.420> take<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.660> few<00:00:48.960> seconds<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.530> load<00:00:49.680> up<00:00:49.890> it's

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
to take a few seconds to load up it's

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.310 
to take a few seconds to load up it's
not<00:00:50.550> horrible<00:00:51.090> but<00:00:51.149> it's<00:00:51.539> not<00:00:51.719> quick<00:00:52.020> either

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
not horrible but it's not quick either

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.529 
not horrible but it's not quick either
so<00:00:52.680> again<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.550> point<00:00:53.789> of<00:00:53.850> all<00:00:54.000> this<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.390> it

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
so again the point of all this is it

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.779 
so again the point of all this is it
needs<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.870> be<00:00:54.960> really<00:00:55.350> really<00:00:55.379> fast<00:00:55.860> this<00:00:56.610> is

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
needs to be really really fast this is

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.080 
needs to be really really fast this is
not<00:00:56.910> really<00:00:57.210> really<00:00:57.420> fast<00:00:57.890> so<00:00:58.890> here<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.879> gives

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
not really really fast so here it gives

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.020 
not really really fast so here it gives
us<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.420> list<00:01:00.600> of<00:01:00.750> things<00:01:00.870> we<00:01:01.020> can<00:01:01.230> say<00:01:01.789> so<00:01:02.789> let's
