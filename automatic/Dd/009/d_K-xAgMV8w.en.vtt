hitting units you can press f1 to do

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:15.140 
hitting units you can press f1 to do
that<00:00:08.040> and<00:00:08.450> spawning<00:00:09.450> our<00:00:09.809> player<00:00:13.790> next<00:00:14.790> we'll

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
that and spawning our player next we'll

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.870 
that and spawning our player next we'll
go<00:00:15.299> into<00:00:15.450> modules<00:00:15.960> and<00:00:16.199> select<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.190> UAV

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
go into modules and select the UAV

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.990 
go into modules and select the UAV
module<00:00:18.439> you'll<00:00:19.439> find<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.830> UAV<00:00:20.189> module<00:00:20.670> down

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
module you'll find the UAV module down

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.870 
module you'll find the UAV module down
the<00:00:21.180> bottom<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:21.750> it's<00:00:22.619> simply<00:00:22.949> called<00:00:23.160> UAV

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.570 

now<00:00:26.880> we'll<00:00:27.570> go<00:00:27.779> back<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:28.170> unit<00:00:28.470> so<00:00:28.769> press<00:00:29.130> f1

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
now we'll go back to unit so press f1

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.780 
now we'll go back to unit so press f1
again<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:30.000> go<00:00:30.119> there<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:31.040> we'll<00:00:32.040> spawn<00:00:32.430> the

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
again to go there and we'll spawn the

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.569 
again to go there and we'll spawn the
UAV<00:00:33.210> terminal<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.930> do<00:00:34.050> this<00:00:34.290> you<00:00:35.040> change<00:00:35.070> the

you spawn the mq-9 too close to any

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.160 
you spawn the mq-9 too close to any
other<00:01:52.890> unit<00:01:53.369> it'll<00:01:53.640> probably<00:01:53.880> latch<00:01:54.570> onto<00:01:54.869> it

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
and make it part of its group so hit f2

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.899 
and make it part of its group so hit f2
and<00:01:58.130> ungroup<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.250> from<00:01:59.460> anything<00:01:59.820> nearby<00:02:01.909> now

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
and ungroup it from anything nearby now

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.089 
and ungroup it from anything nearby now
we<00:02:03.479> have<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:04.219> synchronize<00:02:06.020> the<00:02:07.020> drone<00:02:07.409> the

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
and the terminal to the module so hit f5

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.900 
and the terminal to the module so hit f5
and<00:02:14.940> synchronize<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:16.290> drone<00:02:16.590> to<00:02:17.459> the<00:02:17.550> module

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
and synchronize the drone to the module

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.860 
and synchronize the drone to the module
then<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.020> player<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:20.069> the<00:02:20.970> terminal<00:02:21.450> now
