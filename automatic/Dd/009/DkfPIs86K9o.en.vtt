this is and the rewards from or events
bit<00:01:02.960> like<00:01:03.110> probably<00:01:03.409> like<00:01:03.559> karma<00:01:04.159> but<00:01:04.339> what

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
bit like probably like karma but what

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.840 
bit like probably like karma but what
happens<00:01:05.269> is<00:01:05.420> when<00:01:05.600> you<00:01:05.780> do<00:01:06.619> the<00:01:06.890> or<00:01:07.130> dynamic

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
happens is when you do the or dynamic

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.940 
happens is when you do the or dynamic
events<00:01:07.970> you<00:01:08.360> get<00:01:08.570> these<00:01:09.080> kind<00:01:09.350> of<00:01:09.439> rewards<00:01:09.799> you
