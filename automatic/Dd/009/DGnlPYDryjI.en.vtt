several advantages over standard hard

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.920 
several advantages over standard hard

times lower temperature are much more

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.870 
times lower temperature are much more
reliable<00:01:10.260> because<00:01:10.619> they<00:01:11.100> have<00:01:11.340> no<00:01:11.610> moving

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
reliable because they have no moving

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.679 
reliable because they have no moving
