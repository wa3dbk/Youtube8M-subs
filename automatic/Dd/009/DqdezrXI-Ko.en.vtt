okay<00:01:47.320> so<00:01:47.380> we<00:01:47.859> added<00:01:48.039> tampermonkey<00:01:48.579> to<00:01:49.060> crawl

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
okay so we added tampermonkey to crawl

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:55.709 
okay so we added tampermonkey to crawl
there<00:01:50.409> you<00:01:50.500> have<00:01:50.649> it<00:01:52.469> now<00:01:54.090> or<00:01:55.090> the<00:01:55.299> simulator

this<00:03:05.620> little<00:03:06.400> green<00:03:06.940> bubble<00:03:07.359> over<00:03:07.569> here

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
this little green bubble over here

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.640 
this little green bubble over here
should<00:03:09.160> be<00:03:09.430> read<00:03:10.150> when<00:03:10.720> you<00:03:10.840> first<00:03:11.109> installed

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
should be read when you first installed

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.699 
should be read when you first installed
mind<00:03:12.639> green<00:03:13.000> because<00:03:13.420> I<00:03:14.069> already<00:03:15.069> had<00:03:15.670> it<00:03:15.849> on

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
mind green because I already had it on

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.190 
mind green because I already had it on
so<00:03:17.709> when<00:03:18.220> you<00:03:18.310> press<00:03:18.519> start<00:03:18.849> it<00:03:19.540> should<00:03:19.900> turn

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
so when you press start it should turn

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.220 
so when you press start it should turn
green

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:29.520 

after<00:03:23.860> that<00:03:25.140> you<00:03:26.140> have<00:03:26.379> to

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:46.690 

refresh<00:03:30.530> your<00:03:31.190> page<00:03:33.460> simply<00:03:34.460> refresh<00:03:34.760> it

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:55.120 

establishing<00:03:47.700> battlefield<00:03:48.300> control<00:03:48.630> standby

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:00.460 

go<00:03:56.130> attack<00:03:57.470> anything<00:03:58.470> you<00:03:58.740> want<00:03:58.950> just<00:03:59.160> big<00:03:59.850> one

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
go attack anything you want just big one

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.310 
go attack anything you want just big one
attack<00:04:01.470> there<00:04:02.370> it<00:04:02.460> is

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
attack there it is

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:09.890 
attack there it is
so<00:04:04.610> this<00:04:06.380> simulation<00:04:07.380> speed<00:04:08.130> just<00:04:08.610> like<00:04:08.900> the

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
so this simulation speed just like the

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.700 
so this simulation speed just like the
real<00:04:10.050> attack<00:04:10.440> and<00:04:11.000> this<00:04:12.000> is<00:04:12.300> for<00:04:13.050> accelerate

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:13.710 
real attack and this is for accelerate

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.500 
real attack and this is for accelerate
playback<00:04:14.190> so<00:04:14.610> you<00:04:15.120> can<00:04:15.360> see<00:04:15.630> faster<00:04:17.209> so<00:04:18.209> I'm

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
playback so you can see faster so I'm

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.979 
playback so you can see faster so I'm
gonna<00:04:18.840> show<00:04:19.650> you<00:04:20.120> one<00:04:21.120> more<00:04:21.299> one<00:04:21.630> more<00:04:21.660> thing

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
gonna show you one more one more thing

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.940 
gonna show you one more one more thing
don't<00:04:22.290> forget<00:04:22.940> don't<00:04:23.940> put<00:04:24.180> it<00:04:24.330> more<00:04:24.540> than<00:04:24.950> 2.0

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
don't forget don't put it more than 2.0

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:29.540 
don't forget don't put it more than 2.0
because<00:04:26.340> it<00:04:26.880> may<00:04:27.090> crash<00:04:27.800> so<00:04:28.800> there<00:04:29.430> you<00:04:29.490> have

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
because it may crash so there you have

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:36.280 
because it may crash so there you have
it
