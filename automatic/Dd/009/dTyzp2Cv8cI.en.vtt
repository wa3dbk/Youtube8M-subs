amount of buildings and then you can

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.510 
amount of buildings and then you can
feed<00:02:09.060> decorations<00:02:09.800> like<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.979> statue<00:02:11.220> of<00:02:11.400> a

you can place them on this map that you

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.800 
you can place them on this map that you
can<00:02:16.740> see<00:02:17.040> right<00:02:17.190> here<00:02:17.430> I<00:02:17.610> can<00:02:18.000> also<00:02:18.120> zoom<00:02:18.270> in<00:02:18.510> so

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
for me as you can see the currency is at

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.260 
for me as you can see the currency is at
the<00:02:35.280> top<00:02:35.460> we<00:02:35.640> got<00:02:35.760> coins

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
the top we got coins

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.780 
the top we got coins
we<00:02:36.450> got<00:02:36.660> gems<00:02:36.990> and<00:02:37.320> we<00:02:38.070> got<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.640> other

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
we got gems and we got the other

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.790 
we got gems and we got the other
resources<00:02:39.390> as<00:02:39.570> I<00:02:39.600> said<00:02:39.900> carrots<00:02:40.380> and<00:02:40.650> stuff

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
resources as I said carrots and stuff

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.880 
resources as I said carrots and stuff
like<00:02:41.010> that<00:02:41.190> so<00:02:42.150> this<00:02:42.480> is<00:02:42.540> my<00:02:42.690> main<00:02:43.050> base<00:02:43.320> this

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
like that so this is my main base this

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.370 
like that so this is my main base this
one<00:02:44.160> right<00:02:44.490> here<00:02:44.850> and<00:02:45.030> here<00:02:45.720> were<00:02:45.900> into<00:02:46.260> the

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
one right here and here were into the

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.020 
one right here and here were into the
wild<00:02:46.770> where<00:02:47.130> you<00:02:47.220> can<00:02:47.370> actually<00:02:47.760> capture

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
wild where you can actually capture

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.420 
wild where you can actually capture
creatures<00:02:48.660> so<00:02:48.960> I<00:02:49.050> can<00:02:49.200> set<00:02:49.410> it<00:02:49.440> up<00:02:49.620> trap<00:02:50.010> here

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
creatures so I can set it up trap here

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.300 
creatures so I can set it up trap here
and<00:02:50.760> these<00:02:51.270> little<00:02:51.540> critters<00:02:51.900> would<00:02:52.230> come<00:02:52.500> eat

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
and these little critters would come eat

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.130 
and these little critters would come eat
the<00:02:53.550> bait<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:54.090> would<00:02:54.300> be<00:02:54.420> captured<00:02:54.780> by<00:02:54.930> me

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
the bait and would be captured by me

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.040 
the bait and would be captured by me
then<00:02:55.650> I<00:02:55.800> will<00:02:55.950> take<00:02:56.160> them<00:02:56.540> right<00:02:57.540> here<00:02:57.780> in<00:02:57.930> this

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
then I will take them right here in this

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.470 
then I will take them right here in this
pan<00:02:58.440> like<00:02:59.070> this<00:02:59.220> little<00:02:59.430> ball<00:02:59.700> where<00:03:00.300> I<00:03:00.330> have

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
pan like this little ball where I have

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.630 
pan like this little ball where I have
to<00:03:00.630> fit<00:03:00.870> them<00:03:01.080> stuff<00:03:01.380> in<00:03:01.620> order<00:03:01.770> to<00:03:01.890> tame<00:03:02.190> them

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
to fit them stuff in order to tame them

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.060 
to fit them stuff in order to tame them
once<00:03:03.150> I<00:03:03.300> tame<00:03:03.540> them<00:03:03.840> I<00:03:03.960> have<00:03:04.170> to<00:03:04.320> build<00:03:04.590> a<00:03:04.830> lair

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
once I tame them I have to build a lair

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.250 
once I tame them I have to build a lair
for<00:03:05.370> them<00:03:05.550> like<00:03:05.880> this<00:03:06.090> ones<00:03:06.360> and<00:03:06.660> they<00:03:07.080> will

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
for them like this ones and they will

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.020 
for them like this ones and they will
start<00:03:07.500> making<00:03:07.920> resources<00:03:08.520> for<00:03:08.700> me

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
start making resources for me

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.470 
start making resources for me
so<00:03:09.480> basically<00:03:09.810> trap<00:03:10.350> them<00:03:11.060> supposedly<00:03:12.060> this

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
so basically trap them supposedly this

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.140 
so basically trap them supposedly this
is<00:03:12.540> a<00:03:12.690> hunt<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:13.710> gather<00:03:13.860> game<00:03:14.250> not<00:03:14.760> exactly

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
is a hunt and gather game not exactly

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.900 
is a hunt and gather game not exactly
it's<00:03:15.660> a<00:03:15.810> trap<00:03:16.050> tame<00:03:16.530> and<00:03:16.830> gather<00:03:17.520> resources

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
it's a trap tame and gather resources

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.540 
it's a trap tame and gather resources
title<00:03:18.450> it<00:03:18.959> has<00:03:19.020> a<00:03:19.200> lot<00:03:19.410> of<00:03:19.440> in-app<00:03:19.860> purchases

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
title it has a lot of in-app purchases

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:21.860 
title it has a lot of in-app purchases
because<00:03:20.790> you're<00:03:21.120> easily<00:03:21.300> run<00:03:21.660> out<00:03:21.840> of

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
because you're easily run out of

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.380 
because you're easily run out of
resources<00:03:22.280> and<00:03:23.280> they're<00:03:23.610> quite<00:03:23.790> expensive<00:03:23.910> if

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
resources and they're quite expensive if

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:26.750 
resources and they're quite expensive if
as<00:03:24.540> me<00:03:24.840> it's<00:03:25.470> a<00:03:25.560> boring<00:03:25.920> game<00:03:26.100> as<00:03:26.340> you<00:03:26.430> can<00:03:26.490> see

to build stuff I depend on these

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.410 
to build stuff I depend on these
resources<00:03:37.830> so<00:03:38.670> it<00:03:38.760> can<00:03:39.000> try<00:03:39.180> to<00:03:39.240> increase

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
resources so it can try to increase

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.650 
resources so it can try to increase
storage<00:03:39.750> but<00:03:40.200> there<00:03:40.890> has<00:03:41.280> to<00:03:41.310> be<00:03:41.490> a<00:03:41.820> lot<00:03:42.450> more

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660

the soups will allow you to upgrade the

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.170 
the soups will allow you to upgrade the
creatures<00:03:49.080> and<00:03:49.440> make<00:03:49.560> them<00:03:49.800> work<00:03:50.010> faster<00:03:50.490> so

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
creatures and make them work faster so

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.720 
creatures and make them work faster so
for<00:03:51.360> example<00:03:51.810> this<00:03:52.770> is<00:03:52.950> the<00:03:53.070> eve<00:03:53.190> of<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.520> molar

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
for example this is the eve of the molar

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.940 
for example this is the eve of the molar
bear<00:03:54.000> I<00:03:54.209> can<00:03:54.630> boost<00:03:54.840> him<00:03:55.080> with<00:03:55.260> some<00:03:55.470> soup<00:03:55.770> and

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
bear I can boost him with some soup and

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.900 
bear I can boost him with some soup and
make<00:03:56.730> him<00:03:56.940> produce<00:03:57.150> more<00:03:57.510> carrots<00:03:58.459> and<00:03:59.459> I<00:03:59.700> can

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
make him produce more carrots and I can

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.590 
make him produce more carrots and I can
also<00:04:00.090> upgrade<00:04:00.540> the<00:04:00.900> layer<00:04:01.110> if<00:04:01.590> I<00:04:01.800> want<00:04:02.010> to<00:04:02.190> I

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
also upgrade the layer if I want to I

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.120 
also upgrade the layer if I want to I
can<00:04:03.600> involve<00:04:03.930> his<00:04:04.110> home<00:04:04.350> in<00:04:04.620> order<00:04:04.800> to<00:04:04.920> produce

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
can involve his home in order to produce

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.340 
can involve his home in order to produce
more<00:04:05.430> carrots<00:04:05.850> so<00:04:06.600> the<00:04:06.780> basic<00:04:07.050> idea

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
more carrots so the basic idea

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.770 
more carrots so the basic idea
just<00:04:07.650> like<00:04:07.800> in<00:04:07.950> far<00:04:08.190> will<00:04:08.430> produce<00:04:08.850> a<00:04:09.330> lot<00:04:09.570> of

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
just like in far will produce a lot of

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.840 
just like in far will produce a lot of
vegetables<00:04:10.650> a<00:04:10.920> lot<00:04:11.040> of<00:04:11.160> carrots<00:04:11.520> a<00:04:11.610> lot<00:04:11.700> of

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
vegetables a lot of carrots a lot of

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.880 
vegetables a lot of carrots a lot of
berries<00:04:12.239> which<00:04:12.959> frankly<00:04:13.260> is<00:04:13.470> a<00:04:13.500> bit<00:04:13.709> boring

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
berries which frankly is a bit boring

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:16.190 
berries which frankly is a bit boring
and<00:04:14.430> it's<00:04:14.970> a<00:04:15.090> bit<00:04:15.239> annoying<00:04:15.480> that<00:04:15.810> you<00:04:15.930> have<00:04:16.049> to

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
and it's a bit annoying that you have to

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.740 
and it's a bit annoying that you have to
wait<00:04:16.410> for<00:04:16.830> so<00:04:17.190> long<00:04:17.400> for<00:04:17.669> stuff<00:04:18.180> to<00:04:18.330> happen<00:04:18.450> in

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
wait for so long for stuff to happen in

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.349 
wait for so long for stuff to happen in
the<00:04:18.870> game<00:04:19.049> so<00:04:20.040> let's<00:04:20.340> say<00:04:20.549> I<00:04:20.790> want<00:04:21.000> to<00:04:21.060> create<00:04:21.239> a

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
the game so let's say I want to create a

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.330 
the game so let's say I want to create a
trap<00:04:21.800> for<00:04:22.800> a<00:04:22.860> molar<00:04:23.160> bear

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
trap for a molar bear

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.210 
trap for a molar bear
press<00:04:24.669> build<00:04:25.300> and<00:04:25.660> then<00:04:26.500> I<00:04:26.530> have<00:04:26.740> to<00:04:26.860> move<00:04:27.070> it

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
press build and then I have to move it

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.800 
press build and then I have to move it
around<00:04:27.370> the<00:04:27.669> map<00:04:27.850> I<00:04:29.340> place<00:04:30.340> it<00:04:30.520> here<00:04:30.550> I<00:04:31.030> wait

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
around the map I place it here I wait

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.270 
around the map I place it here I wait
for<00:04:32.020> a<00:04:32.080> model<00:04:32.440> birth<00:04:32.650> to<00:04:32.830> thumb

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
for a model birth to thumb

for a model birth to thumb
this<00:04:34.090> is<00:04:34.270> Grogg<00:04:34.540> and<00:04:35.530> then<00:04:35.860> I<00:04:36.040> can<00:04:36.280> operate<00:04:36.610> my

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
this is Grogg and then I can operate my

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.430 
this is Grogg and then I can operate my
trap<00:04:37.030> to<00:04:37.240> increase<00:04:37.540> the<00:04:37.690> chances<00:04:37.990> as<00:04:38.169> you<00:04:38.290> can

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440

see we have clover fields indicating the
lock<00:04:41.669> percentage<00:04:42.669> that<00:04:42.850> I<00:04:42.880> have<00:04:43.150> in<00:04:43.479> capturing

the creature increased my luck increased

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.290 
the creature increased my luck increased
it<00:04:46.270> again<00:04:46.570> and<00:04:46.840> now<00:04:47.800> the<00:04:47.860> molar<00:04:48.280> burn<00:04:48.610> has<00:04:48.970> come

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
it again and now the molar burn has come

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:56.850 
it again and now the molar burn has come
and<00:04:50.010> he's<00:04:51.010> trapped<00:04:55.169> the<00:04:56.169> music<00:04:56.470> is<00:04:56.560> kind<00:04:56.770> of

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
and he's trapped the music is kind of

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:08.129 
and he's trapped the music is kind of
cute<00:05:05.190> and<00:05:06.190> now<00:05:07.000> the<00:05:07.060> molar<00:05:07.510> bear<00:05:07.720> will<00:05:07.930> have<00:05:08.020> to

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:08.139 
cute and now the molar bear will have to

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:09.990 
cute and now the molar bear will have to
be<00:05:08.229> taken<00:05:08.560> to<00:05:08.590> my<00:05:08.800> pants<00:05:09.100> however<00:05:09.550> I<00:05:09.639> already

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.000 
be taken to my pants however I already

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.840 
be taken to my pants however I already
have<00:05:10.210> an<00:05:10.330> animal<00:05:10.660> in<00:05:10.750> the<00:05:10.840> pan<00:05:11.310> who<00:05:12.310> is<00:05:12.490> eating

have an animal in the pan who is eating

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:16.020 
have an animal in the pan who is eating
some<00:05:13.120> resources<00:05:13.720> so<00:05:14.680> that's<00:05:14.889> about<00:05:15.070> it<00:05:15.430> the

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030 
some resources so that's about it the

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.570 
some resources so that's about it the
idea<00:05:16.300> is<00:05:16.419> to<00:05:16.450> tap<00:05:16.840> the<00:05:17.020> screen<00:05:17.220> based<00:05:18.220> on

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
idea is to tap the screen based on

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.300 
idea is to tap the screen based on
collect<00:05:19.060> stuff<00:05:19.530> to<00:05:20.530> make<00:05:20.650> your<00:05:20.860> creatures
