00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
literally like two seconds right after

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.569 
literally like two seconds right after
me<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.809> that<00:00:57.809> was<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:58.079> game<00:00:58.739> over<00:00:59.070> that's<00:00:59.340> how

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
me and that was it game over that's how

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.900 
me and that was it game over that's how
fast<00:00:59.820> that<00:01:00.059> ended<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.480> was<00:01:00.570> just<00:01:00.840> so<00:01:01.050> like

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
fast that ended it was just so like

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
fast that ended it was just so like
aggravating<00:01:02.910> because<00:01:03.059> we<00:01:03.359> were<00:01:03.449> only<00:01:03.570> three

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
aggravating because we were only three

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.630 
aggravating because we were only three
rounds<00:01:04.229> away<00:01:04.409> from<00:01:04.589> 200<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.189> that's<00:01:05.309> what<00:01:05.519> we

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
rounds away from 200 and that's what we

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.830 
rounds away from 200 and that's what we
were<00:01:05.760> trying<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.090> do<00:01:06.210> we<00:01:06.390> were<00:01:06.479> trying<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.750> get

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
were trying to do we were trying to get

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.859 
were trying to do we were trying to get
to<00:01:06.930> 200<00:01:07.640> so<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.790> strategy<00:01:09.180> we<00:01:09.299> use<00:01:09.450> this<00:01:09.600> game

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
to 200 so the strategy we use this game

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.109 
to 200 so the strategy we use this game
was<00:01:10.200> pretty<00:01:10.680> good<00:01:10.799> I<00:01:10.950> thought<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:11.820> think

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
was pretty good I thought and I think

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.240 
was pretty good I thought and I think
this<00:01:12.270> is<00:01:12.420> one<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.780> best<00:01:12.960> spots<00:01:13.860> where<00:01:14.130> you

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
this is one of the best spots where you

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.920 
this is one of the best spots where you
can<00:01:14.400> hold<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.670> down<00:01:14.790> on<00:01:15.000> this<00:01:15.119> map<00:01:15.330> we<00:01:15.540> did<00:01:15.720> try

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
can hold it down on this map we did try

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.260 
can hold it down on this map we did try
a<00:01:15.960> couple<00:01:16.290> different<00:01:16.560> things<00:01:16.590> but<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.700> think

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
a couple different things but I think

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.140 
a couple different things but I think
this<00:01:18.600> spot<00:01:18.840> is<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.110> best<00:01:19.290> spot<00:01:19.500> because<00:01:20.150> it's

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
really quick and then you're pretty much

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.810 
really quick and then you're pretty much
all<00:02:18.840> set<00:02:19.050> from<00:02:19.260> there<00:02:19.440> but<00:02:19.680> it's<00:02:20.580> a<00:02:20.670> really

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
all set from there but it's a really

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.460 
all set from there but it's a really
easy<00:02:20.940> strategy<00:02:22.430> great<00:02:23.430> little<00:02:23.670> spot<00:02:23.910> I<00:02:24.350> did<00:02:25.350> do

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
easy strategy great little spot I did do

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.320 
easy strategy great little spot I did do
a<00:02:25.500> search<00:02:25.800> on<00:02:26.010> YouTube<00:02:26.400> and<00:02:26.640> I<00:02:26.700> noticed<00:02:27.150> that

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
a search on YouTube and I noticed that

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.850 
a search on YouTube and I noticed that
there<00:02:27.510> was<00:02:27.600> one<00:02:27.870> other<00:02:28.050> person<00:02:28.440> that<00:02:28.470> found

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
there was one other person that found

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.880 
there was one other person that found
this<00:02:29.400> spot<00:02:29.730> also<00:02:30.030> so<00:02:30.600> and<00:02:31.200> he<00:02:31.620> ended<00:02:31.800> up

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
this spot also so and he ended up

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.580 
this spot also so and he ended up
getting<00:02:32.040> to<00:02:32.430> like<00:02:33.000> around<00:02:33.300> 170<00:02:34.020> something<00:02:34.200> so

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
getting to like around 170 something so

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.650 
getting to like around 170 something so
it<00:02:35.070> is<00:02:35.280> a<00:02:35.310> really<00:02:35.550> good<00:02:35.820> spot<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.240> hold<00:02:36.330> it<00:02:36.510> down

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
it is a really good spot to hold it down

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.680 
it is a really good spot to hold it down
so<00:02:37.490> this<00:02:38.490> game<00:02:38.670> I<00:02:38.790> ended<00:02:39.030> up<00:02:39.120> choosing<00:02:39.330> the

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
so this game I ended up choosing the

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.720 
so this game I ended up choosing the
light<00:02:40.050> EXO<00:02:40.440> character<00:02:40.890> and<00:02:41.010> my<00:02:41.130> partner<00:02:41.520> chose

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
light EXO character and my partner chose

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.880 
light EXO character and my partner chose
the<00:02:41.940> specialist<00:02:42.450> EXO<00:02:42.780> character<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:43.709> the

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
the specialist EXO character and the

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.199 
the specialist EXO character and the
reason<00:02:44.130> why<00:02:44.220> I<00:02:44.250> chose<00:02:44.489> the<00:02:44.670> light<00:02:44.850> EXO

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
reason why I chose the light EXO

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.090 
reason why I chose the light EXO
characters<00:02:45.660> because<00:02:46.050> you<00:02:46.260> have<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:46.620> UAV

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
characters because you have the UAV

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.190 
characters because you have the UAV
scorestreak<00:02:47.790> and<00:02:48.060> if<00:02:48.390> you<00:02:48.510> have<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:48.810> hardline

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
scorestreak and if you have the hardline

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.860 
scorestreak and if you have the hardline
perk<00:02:49.530> and<00:02:49.800> your<00:02:50.459> UAV<00:02:50.970> is<00:02:51.090> upgraded<00:02:51.630> all<00:02:51.750> the

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
perk and your UAV is upgraded all the

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.560 
perk and your UAV is upgraded all the
way<00:02:51.989> you<00:02:52.590> can<00:02:52.709> pretty<00:02:52.890> much<00:02:52.980> have<00:02:53.160> a<00:02:53.400> UAV<00:02:53.790> every

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
way you can pretty much have a UAV every

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.330 
way you can pretty much have a UAV every
single<00:02:54.930> round<00:02:55.200> at<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.830> beginning<00:02:56.190> of<00:02:56.250> the

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
single round at the beginning of the

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.910 
single round at the beginning of the
round<00:02:56.489> so<00:02:56.850> I<00:02:56.880> always<00:02:57.180> know<00:02:57.540> where<00:02:57.780> the<00:02:57.989> AI<00:02:58.500> is

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
round so I always know where the AI is

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.820 
round so I always know where the AI is
spawning<00:02:59.220> in<00:02:59.459> from<00:02:59.760> so<00:03:00.120> it's<00:03:01.020> a<00:03:01.170> great<00:03:01.410> little

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
spawning in from so it's a great little

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.500 
spawning in from so it's a great little
scorestreak<00:03:02.580> to<00:03:02.730> have<00:03:02.940> and<00:03:03.209> that's<00:03:03.330> why<00:03:03.480> I

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
scorestreak to have and that's why I

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.320 
scorestreak to have and that's why I
chose<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:04.020> light<00:03:04.170> EXO<00:03:04.620> my<00:03:05.370> partner<00:03:05.790> chose<00:03:06.060> the

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.420 
chose the light EXO my partner chose the
specialist<00:03:07.200> EXO<00:03:07.560> because<00:03:07.830> you<00:03:07.920> get<00:03:08.070> a<00:03:08.100> remote

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
almost every single round and remote

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.350 
almost every single round and remote
turrets<00:03:13.709> are<00:03:13.920> great<00:03:14.340> against<00:03:14.910> those<00:03:15.030> little

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
turrets are great against those little

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.780 
turrets are great against those little
mechanical<00:03:15.510> bosses<00:03:16.260> that<00:03:16.410> come<00:03:16.709> every<00:03:16.950> couple

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
mechanical bosses that come every couple

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.820 
mechanical bosses that come every couple
rounds<00:03:17.970> it<00:03:18.510> takes<00:03:18.750> those<00:03:18.930> things<00:03:18.989> out<00:03:19.470> in<00:03:19.650> like

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
rounds it takes those things out in like

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.729 
rounds it takes those things out in like
one<00:03:20.220> or<00:03:20.340> two<00:03:20.370> shots<00:03:20.850> and<00:03:21.290> that's<00:03:22.290> pretty<00:03:22.620> much

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
one or two shots and that's pretty much

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.699 
one or two shots and that's pretty much
it<00:03:22.920> and<00:03:23.190> that's<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.430> reason<00:03:23.459> why<00:03:23.820> we<00:03:23.970> chose<00:03:24.000> a

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
down does so many times but we found out

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.130 
down does so many times but we found out
a<00:03:53.070> little<00:03:53.220> trick<00:03:53.640> on<00:03:54.510> how<00:03:54.690> to<00:03:54.750> get<00:03:54.959> rid<00:03:55.110> of

a little trick on how to get rid of

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.319 
a little trick on how to get rid of
those<00:03:55.290> pretty<00:03:55.709> easily<00:03:56.060> so<00:03:57.060> there's<00:03:57.239> two

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
those pretty easily so there's two

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.660 
those pretty easily so there's two
different<00:03:57.600> things<00:03:57.720> you<00:03:57.870> can<00:03:57.989> do<00:03:58.489> the<00:03:59.489> obvious

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
different things you can do the obvious

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.430 
different things you can do the obvious
is<00:04:00.180> the<00:04:00.360> trophy<00:04:00.690> system<00:04:01.019> you<00:04:01.170> can<00:04:01.290> put<00:04:01.410> a

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
is the trophy system you can put a

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.960 
is the trophy system you can put a
trophy<00:04:01.799> system<00:04:01.950> on<00:04:02.220> your<00:04:02.340> back<00:04:02.459> but<00:04:02.670> I<00:04:02.730> don't

just in case of those micro drones come

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.030 
just in case of those micro drones come
we<00:04:51.910> make<00:04:52.600> sure<00:04:52.750> we<00:04:52.900> always<00:04:53.260> have<00:04:53.440> grenades<00:04:53.830> on

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
we make sure we always have grenades on

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.890 
we make sure we always have grenades on
us<00:04:54.220> so<00:04:54.940> we<00:04:54.970> can<00:04:55.180> get<00:04:55.270> rid<00:04:55.420> of<00:04:55.480> those<00:04:55.600> pretty

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
us so we can get rid of those pretty

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.980 
us so we can get rid of those pretty
quickly<00:04:56.200> so<00:04:57.270> the<00:04:58.270> next<00:04:58.450> thing<00:04:58.570> I<00:04:58.630> want<00:04:58.810> to<00:04:58.840> talk

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
quickly so the next thing I want to talk

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.510 
quickly so the next thing I want to talk
about<00:04:59.170> is<00:04:59.410> the<00:04:59.500> cloak<00:04:59.710> ability<00:04:59.950> I<00:05:00.160> think

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:00.520 
about is the cloak ability I think

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:02.490 
about is the cloak ability I think
that's<00:05:00.700> the<00:05:00.880> best<00:05:01.060> ability<00:05:01.300> to<00:05:01.630> use<00:05:01.840> on<00:05:02.140> EXO

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
that's the best ability to use on EXO

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.560 
that's the best ability to use on EXO
survival<00:05:02.680> and<00:05:03.280> there's<00:05:03.670> a<00:05:03.730> few<00:05:03.910> reasons<00:05:04.120> why<00:05:04.540> I

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
survival and there's a few reasons why I

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.860 
survival and there's a few reasons why I
think<00:05:04.870> that<00:05:05.280> for<00:05:06.280> example<00:05:06.760> if<00:05:07.240> you<00:05:07.480> need<00:05:07.660> to<00:05:07.720> go

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
think that for example if you need to go

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.900 
think that for example if you need to go
and<00:05:08.110> complete<00:05:08.890> an<00:05:09.010> objective<00:05:09.130> let's<00:05:09.730> say

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
and complete an objective let's say

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.480 
and complete an objective let's say
dogtags<00:05:10.630> for<00:05:10.900> example<00:05:11.380> if<00:05:11.860> you<00:05:12.070> need<00:05:12.220> to<00:05:12.250> run

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
dogtags for example if you need to run

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.150 
dogtags for example if you need to run
out<00:05:12.640> in<00:05:12.820> the<00:05:12.910> middle<00:05:12.970> of<00:05:13.390> a<00:05:13.810> round<00:05:14.200> you<00:05:14.920> can<00:05:15.070> go

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:15.160 
out in the middle of a round you can go

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.800 
out in the middle of a round you can go
ahead<00:05:15.310> and<00:05:15.400> put<00:05:15.490> your<00:05:15.610> cloak<00:05:15.850> on<00:05:16.060> run<00:05:16.540> out<00:05:16.660> in

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
ahead and put your cloak on run out in

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.090 
ahead and put your cloak on run out in
the<00:05:16.870> middle<00:05:17.050> of<00:05:17.110> a<00:05:17.200> round<00:05:17.410> start<00:05:17.710> collecting

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
the middle of a round start collecting

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.570 
the middle of a round start collecting
dog<00:05:18.310> tags<00:05:18.900> without<00:05:19.900> getting<00:05:20.320> shot<00:05:20.350> so<00:05:21.040> that's

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
dog tags without getting shot so that's

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.250 
dog tags without getting shot so that's
one<00:05:21.790> reason<00:05:22.150> why<00:05:22.270> I<00:05:22.300> like<00:05:22.600> that<00:05:22.840> and<00:05:23.050> then<00:05:23.170> the

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.260 
one reason why I like that and then the

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.660 
one reason why I like that and then the
second<00:05:23.620> reason<00:05:23.740> why<00:05:24.010> I<00:05:24.040> like<00:05:24.310> the<00:05:24.460> cloak

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:24.670 
second reason why I like the cloak

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.270 
second reason why I like the cloak
ability<00:05:24.880> is<00:05:25.270> because<00:05:26.170> let's<00:05:26.440> say<00:05:26.530> if<00:05:26.830> you<00:05:27.100> go

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 
ability is because let's say if you go

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.840 
ability is because let's say if you go
down<00:05:27.490> or<00:05:27.850> if<00:05:28.270> your<00:05:28.510> partner<00:05:28.930> goes<00:05:29.110> down<00:05:29.850> you

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:53.960

that's<00:06:58.969> the<00:06:59.120> reason<00:06:59.330> why<00:06:59.449> my<00:06:59.599> partner<00:06:59.780> jumped

00:07:00.309 --> 00:07:00.319 
that's the reason why my partner jumped

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:02.230 
that's the reason why my partner jumped
out<00:07:00.409> the<00:07:00.560> window<00:07:00.830> when<00:07:00.979> I<00:07:01.039> went<00:07:01.340> down<00:07:01.580> because

00:07:05.679 --> 00:07:05.689 
the AI saw him turn his cloak on so he

00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:07.059 
the AI saw him turn his cloak on so he
jumped<00:07:05.990> out<00:07:06.080> the<00:07:06.139> window<00:07:06.289> so<00:07:06.740> that<00:07:06.889> way<00:07:07.039> he

00:07:07.059 --> 00:07:07.069 
jumped out the window so that way he

00:07:07.069 --> 00:07:08.980 
jumped out the window so that way he
could<00:07:07.400> lose<00:07:07.580> the<00:07:07.639> AI<00:07:07.939> they<00:07:08.479> didn't<00:07:08.750> know<00:07:08.810> where

could lose the AI they didn't know where
he<00:07:09.110> was<00:07:09.319> and<00:07:09.620> he<00:07:10.580> would<00:07:10.699> jump<00:07:10.939> back<00:07:11.180> in<00:07:11.389> the
