00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.230 

so<00:00:06.190> the<00:00:06.310> first<00:00:06.550> thing<00:00:06.730> we're<00:00:06.880> going<00:00:07.000> to<00:00:07.060> look

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:07.240 
so the first thing we're going to look

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.289 
so the first thing we're going to look
at<00:00:07.450> is<00:00:08.190> comparing<00:00:09.190> the<00:00:09.219> difference<00:00:09.700> in<00:00:10.030> sort

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:10.299 
at is comparing the difference in sort

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:12.870 
at is comparing the difference in sort
of<00:00:10.360> what<00:00:10.540> a<00:00:10.570> default<00:00:10.840> reaction<00:00:11.710> is<00:00:11.860> to<00:00:12.490> force

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:12.880 
of what a default reaction is to force

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.530 
of what a default reaction is to force
coming<00:00:13.210> into<00:00:13.450> the<00:00:13.690> body<00:00:13.900> and<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:15.849> first<00:00:16.150> two

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:16.540 
coming into the body and the first two

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.050 
coming into the body and the first two
I'm<00:00:17.110> gonna<00:00:17.349> show<00:00:17.590> you<00:00:17.650> are<00:00:18.220> sort<00:00:18.460> of<00:00:18.550> typical

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.060 
I'm gonna show you are sort of typical

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.850 
I'm gonna show you are sort of typical
responses<00:00:19.599> if<00:00:19.750> we're<00:00:19.900> not<00:00:20.050> thinking<00:00:20.259> about<00:00:20.529> it

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:20.860 
responses if we're not thinking about it

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.429 
responses if we're not thinking about it
and<00:00:21.040> not<00:00:21.369> trying<00:00:21.669> to<00:00:21.759> engage<00:00:22.149> and<00:00:22.689> be<00:00:22.960> present

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:23.439 
and not trying to engage and be present

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:25.260 
and not trying to engage and be present
to<00:00:23.529> what's<00:00:23.680> going<00:00:23.950> on<00:00:24.130> and<00:00:24.460> sort<00:00:24.970> of<00:00:25.000> doing

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.270 
to what's going on and sort of doing

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.269 
to what's going on and sort of doing
these<00:00:25.570> kind<00:00:25.899> of<00:00:25.989> training<00:00:26.320> methods<00:00:26.680> you'll

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:27.279 
these kind of training methods you'll

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:29.519 
these kind of training methods you'll
get<00:00:27.460> one<00:00:27.790> or<00:00:27.939> two<00:00:28.119> of<00:00:28.509> these<00:00:28.960> first<00:00:29.349> two

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:29.529 
get one or two of these first two

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.190 
get one or two of these first two
responses<00:00:30.250> and<00:00:30.570> then<00:00:31.570> we'll<00:00:31.779> talk<00:00:31.899> a<00:00:31.960> little

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:32.200 
responses and then we'll talk a little

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.170 
responses and then we'll talk a little
bit<00:00:32.349> about<00:00:32.470> the<00:00:32.800> third<00:00:33.040> response<00:00:33.489> which

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
bit about the third response which

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.610 
bit about the third response which
actually<00:00:34.750> is<00:00:34.870> the<00:00:34.989> beginning<00:00:35.440> of

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620 
actually is the beginning of

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.310 
actually is the beginning of
neutralizing<00:00:36.550> that<00:00:36.790> incoming<00:00:37.390> incoming

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:38.320 
neutralizing that incoming incoming

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.820 
neutralizing that incoming incoming
force<00:00:38.980> and<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:40.420> beginnings<00:00:41.020> of<00:00:41.350> how<00:00:41.500> to<00:00:41.560> work

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:41.830 
force and the beginnings of how to work

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.070 
force and the beginnings of how to work
out<00:00:42.070> a<00:00:42.100> solution<00:00:42.540> so<00:00:43.540> let's<00:00:43.690> start<00:00:43.870> with<00:00:43.960> the

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:44.080 
out a solution so let's start with the

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.950 
out a solution so let's start with the
first<00:00:44.320> one<00:00:44.730> if<00:00:45.730> Chuck<00:00:46.060> and<00:00:46.210> I<00:00:46.240> square<00:00:46.600> up<00:00:46.750> like

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
first one if Chuck and I square up like

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.680 
first one if Chuck and I square up like
this<00:00:47.230> and<00:00:47.670> we<00:00:48.670> connect<00:00:49.000> to<00:00:49.120> each<00:00:49.210> other<00:00:49.360> here

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
this and we connect to each other here

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.400 
this and we connect to each other here
he's<00:00:50.500> gonna<00:00:50.680> feed<00:00:51.070> some<00:00:51.310> pressure<00:00:51.550> in<00:00:51.880> and<00:00:52.410> if

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
he's gonna feed some pressure in and if

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.700 
he's gonna feed some pressure in and if
I<00:00:53.620> just<00:00:53.860> react<00:00:54.250> by<00:00:55.050> feeling<00:00:56.050> the<00:00:56.140> pressure<00:00:56.410> and

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
I just react by feeling the pressure and

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.580 
I just react by feeling the pressure and
feeling<00:00:57.489> him<00:00:57.640> coming<00:00:58.000> on<00:00:58.150> to<00:00:58.329> me<00:00:58.450> and<00:00:58.660> I<00:00:59.170> tense

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
feeling him coming on to me and I tense

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.670 
feeling him coming on to me and I tense
up<00:00:59.860> around<00:01:00.370> those<00:01:00.670> contact<00:01:01.270> points<00:01:01.750> if<00:01:02.380> he's

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
up around those contact points if he's

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.330 
up around those contact points if he's
bigger<00:01:03.100> or<00:01:03.520> stronger<00:01:04.770> I'm<00:01:05.770> gonna<00:01:05.950> get<00:01:06.100> pushed

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
bigger or stronger I'm gonna get pushed

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.520 
bigger or stronger I'm gonna get pushed
out<00:01:06.490> of<00:01:06.520> the<00:01:06.700> way<00:01:06.869> so<00:01:07.869> that's<00:01:07.990> the<00:01:08.170> first<00:01:08.380> one

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
out of the way so that's the first one

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.440 
out of the way so that's the first one
let's<00:01:08.770> look<00:01:08.860> at<00:01:08.979> that<00:01:09.070> again<00:01:09.310> or<00:01:09.880> say<00:01:10.330> his

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
let's look at that again or say his

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.630 
let's look at that again or say his
hands<00:01:10.659> are<00:01:10.780> up<00:01:10.870> on<00:01:10.960> my<00:01:11.080> shoulders<00:01:11.500> he<00:01:12.100> comes<00:01:12.400> in

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
hands are up on my shoulders he comes in

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.590 
hands are up on my shoulders he comes in
and<00:01:12.790> I<00:01:13.240> brace<00:01:13.720> for<00:01:14.140> it<00:01:14.320> then<00:01:15.010> I<00:01:15.310> become<00:01:15.670> really

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
and I brace for it then I become really

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.260 
and I brace for it then I become really
easy<00:01:16.870> to<00:01:17.110> move<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:18.700> that's<00:01:18.880> the<00:01:18.970> first<00:01:19.180> thing

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
easy to move so that's the first thing

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.060 
easy to move so that's the first thing
we<00:01:19.360> want<00:01:19.630> to<00:01:19.720> avoid<00:01:19.930> you<00:01:20.229> get<00:01:20.409> one<00:01:20.530> more<00:01:20.620> time

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
we want to avoid you get one more time

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.820 
we want to avoid you get one more time
wherever<00:01:21.850> the<00:01:21.970> hands<00:01:22.210> are<00:01:22.360> if<00:01:22.720> that<00:01:23.200> comes<00:01:23.680> in

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
wherever the hands are if that comes in

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.130 
wherever the hands are if that comes in
and<00:01:24.130> I<00:01:24.280> push<00:01:24.850> it<00:01:25.000> back<00:01:25.270> into<00:01:25.540> him

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
and I push it back into him

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.800 
and I push it back into him
I<00:01:26.170> move<00:01:26.830> it<00:01:26.920> back<00:01:26.950> into<00:01:27.340> him<00:01:27.540> I'm<00:01:28.540> gonna<00:01:28.659> go

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
I move it back into him I'm gonna go

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:35.340 
I move it back into him I'm gonna go
find<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:33.310> second<00:01:33.729> one<00:01:33.880> we<00:01:34.869> think<00:01:35.049> okay

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
find the second one we think okay

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.230 
find the second one we think okay
instead<00:01:36.070> of<00:01:36.190> being<00:01:36.400> let's<00:01:36.790> do<00:01:36.880> this<00:01:36.970> again

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
instead of being let's do this again

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.870 
instead of being let's do this again
right<00:01:37.600> instead<00:01:38.290> of<00:01:38.350> being<00:01:38.590> too<00:01:38.920> stiff<00:01:39.430> here

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
right instead of being too stiff here

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.090 
right instead of being too stiff here
and<00:01:40.060> holding<00:01:40.690> on<00:01:40.810> so<00:01:40.990> he<00:01:41.110> comes<00:01:41.350> in<00:01:41.590> and<00:01:41.950> I

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
and holding on so he comes in and I

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.100 
and holding on so he comes in and I
stiffen<00:01:42.490> up

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
stiffen up

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.680 
stiffen up
you<00:01:44.110> only<00:01:44.320> gets<00:01:44.530> away<00:01:44.680> with<00:01:44.710> that<00:01:44.920> two<00:01:45.400> times

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
you only gets away with that two times

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.830 
you only gets away with that two times
so<00:01:46.690> now<00:01:46.840> I<00:01:46.869> think<00:01:47.020> okay<00:01:47.380> I'm<00:01:47.470> gonna<00:01:47.560> relax<00:01:48.840> and

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
so now I think okay I'm gonna relax and

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.950 
so now I think okay I'm gonna relax and
that<00:01:50.710> turns<00:01:50.979> out<00:01:51.159> to<00:01:51.310> be<00:01:51.340> just<00:01:51.430> as<00:01:51.850> bad<00:01:52.060> right

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
that turns out to be just as bad right

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.590 
that turns out to be just as bad right
so<00:01:53.229> again<00:01:53.920> if<00:01:54.070> it's<00:01:54.220> here<00:01:54.580> the<00:01:55.060> hands<00:01:55.360> are<00:01:55.479> up

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
so again if it's here the hands are up

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.020 
so again if it's here the hands are up
on<00:01:55.780> the<00:01:55.900> shoulders<00:01:56.350> and<00:01:56.560> I<00:01:56.770> think<00:01:57.010> oh<00:01:57.189> I<00:01:57.610> want

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
on the shoulders and I think oh I want

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.850 
on the shoulders and I think oh I want
to<00:01:58.090> relax

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
to relax

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.390 
to relax
and<00:01:59.130> collapse<00:02:00.290> he<00:02:01.290> can<00:02:01.500> basically<00:02:01.740> just

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
and collapse he can basically just

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.660 
and collapse he can basically just
follow<00:02:02.730> that<00:02:03.060> right<00:02:03.270> in<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:04.280> feel<00:02:05.280> it<00:02:05.490> it's

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
follow that right in and feel it it's

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.880 
follow that right in and feel it it's
like<00:02:05.940> if<00:02:06.570> it's<00:02:06.720> here<00:02:06.960> on<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.110> show<00:02:07.320> just<00:02:07.770> do

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
like if it's here on the show just do

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.370 
like if it's here on the show just do
like<00:02:08.280> one<00:02:08.460> hand<00:02:08.670> on<00:02:08.790> the<00:02:08.850> shoulder<00:02:09.030> if<00:02:09.360> I<00:02:09.869> think

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
like one hand on the shoulder if I think

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.110 
like one hand on the shoulder if I think
okay<00:02:10.680> it<00:02:10.770> can't<00:02:10.979> be<00:02:11.100> strong<00:02:11.430> in<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.730> shoulder

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
okay it can't be strong in the shoulder

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.600 
okay it can't be strong in the shoulder
so<00:02:12.510> I'm<00:02:12.630> gonna<00:02:12.720> be<00:02:12.930> weak<00:02:13.260> in<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.650> shoulder<00:02:14.100> he

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
so I'm gonna be weak in the shoulder he

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.220 
so I'm gonna be weak in the shoulder he
goes<00:02:14.790> right<00:02:15.090> through<00:02:15.120> that<00:02:15.480> weakness<00:02:15.750> and

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
goes right through that weakness and

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.070 
goes right through that weakness and
finds<00:02:16.760> another<00:02:17.760> stuck<00:02:18.120> spot<00:02:18.390> somewhere<00:02:18.840> in<00:02:18.960> my

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
finds another stuck spot somewhere in my

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.120 
finds another stuck spot somewhere in my
body<00:02:19.670> so<00:02:20.670> you<00:02:21.600> can't<00:02:21.870> tense<00:02:22.200> up<00:02:22.410> into<00:02:23.040> the

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
body so you can't tense up into the

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.670 
body so you can't tense up into the
oncoming<00:02:23.430> force<00:02:23.850> and<00:02:24.120> you<00:02:24.660> can't<00:02:24.930> collapse

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
oncoming force and you can't collapse

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.250 
oncoming force and you can't collapse
into<00:02:25.980> it<00:02:26.570> you've<00:02:27.570> got<00:02:27.720> to<00:02:27.840> find<00:02:27.960> a<00:02:28.080> third

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
into it you've got to find a third

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.490 
into it you've got to find a third
solution<00:02:28.830> and<00:02:29.790> so<00:02:30.450> let's<00:02:30.990> start<00:02:31.230> to<00:02:31.320> talk

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
solution and so let's start to talk

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.920 
solution and so let's start to talk
about<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.860> beginning<00:02:31.980> of<00:02:32.280> that<00:02:32.400> third<00:02:32.700> one<00:02:32.930> so

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
about the beginning of that third one so

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.800 
about the beginning of that third one so
we're<00:02:34.110> here<00:02:34.320> again<00:02:34.620> and<00:02:34.950> if<00:02:35.790> I<00:02:36.180> know<00:02:36.240> I<00:02:36.420> can't

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
we're here again and if I know I can't

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.699 
we're here again and if I know I can't
come<00:02:37.050> this<00:02:37.290> way<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:37.830> I<00:02:38.280> can't<00:02:38.550> go<00:02:38.670> that<00:02:38.880> way

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
come this way and I can't go that way

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.800 
come this way and I can't go that way
the<00:02:40.709> next<00:02:40.950> best<00:02:41.160> thing<00:02:41.310> I<00:02:41.520> want<00:02:41.670> to<00:02:41.730> try<00:02:41.880> is<00:02:42.630> to

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
the next best thing I want to try is to

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.470 
the next best thing I want to try is to
go<00:02:42.959> this<00:02:43.230> way<00:02:43.470> to<00:02:44.130> go<00:02:44.250> down<00:02:44.550> and<00:02:44.970> retie<00:02:45.330> there

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
go this way to go down and retie there

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.730 
go this way to go down and retie there
are<00:02:45.540> a<00:02:45.570> lot<00:02:45.750> of<00:02:45.870> different<00:02:46.140> dimensions<00:02:46.620> to

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
are a lot of different dimensions to

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.220 
are a lot of different dimensions to
sinking<00:02:47.400> and<00:02:47.850> dropping<00:02:48.150> but<00:02:48.870> here's<00:02:49.050> the

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
sinking and dropping but here's the

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.590 
sinking and dropping but here's the
first<00:02:49.380> one<00:02:49.740> so<00:02:50.520> as<00:02:50.640> soon<00:02:50.970> as<00:02:51.180> he<00:02:51.330> comes<00:02:51.600> in<00:02:51.930> I

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
first one so as soon as he comes in I

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.120 
first one so as soon as he comes in I
get<00:02:54.600> down<00:02:54.810> in<00:02:54.990> my<00:02:55.110> legs<00:02:55.350> a<00:02:55.530> little<00:02:55.650> bit<00:02:55.920> more

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
get down in my legs a little bit more

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.490 
get down in my legs a little bit more
now<00:02:57.120> he's<00:02:57.330> good<00:02:57.600> he's<00:02:57.870> gonna<00:02:57.990> figure<00:02:58.290> out<00:02:58.410> a

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
now he's good he's gonna figure out a

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.650 
now he's good he's gonna figure out a
way<00:02:58.680> to<00:02:58.740> do<00:02:58.950> it<00:02:59.100> so<00:02:59.130> usually<00:03:00.090> don't<00:03:00.270> end<00:03:00.450> up<00:03:00.540> in

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
way to do it so usually don't end up in

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.979 
way to do it so usually don't end up in
a<00:03:00.780> situation<00:03:00.990> where<00:03:02.000> you<00:03:03.000> have<00:03:03.150> a<00:03:03.209> completely

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
a situation where you have a completely

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.830 
a situation where you have a completely
static<00:03:04.530> response<00:03:04.730> but<00:03:05.730> watch<00:03:06.060> again<00:03:06.090> we'll<00:03:06.660> go

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
static response but watch again we'll go

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.479 
static response but watch again we'll go
through<00:03:07.050> the<00:03:07.170> three<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.950> difference<00:03:08.070> between

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
through the three the difference between

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.660 
through the three the difference between
trying<00:03:09.030> to<00:03:09.090> go<00:03:09.209> forward<00:03:09.570> in<00:03:09.810> to<00:03:09.900> him<00:03:10.280> back<00:03:11.280> away

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
trying to go forward in to him back away

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.500 
trying to go forward in to him back away
from<00:03:11.940> him<00:03:12.150> and<00:03:12.440> in<00:03:13.440> contrast<00:03:14.030> how<00:03:15.030> it<00:03:15.180> begins

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
from him and in contrast how it begins

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.990 
from him and in contrast how it begins
to<00:03:15.720> neutralize<00:03:16.140> the<00:03:16.380> force<00:03:16.620> if<00:03:17.010> I<00:03:17.130> can<00:03:17.310> go<00:03:17.430> down

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
to neutralize the force if I can go down

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.080 
to neutralize the force if I can go down
so<00:03:18.480> again<00:03:18.830> my<00:03:19.830> reaction<00:03:20.280> is<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.489> go<00:03:20.610> right<00:03:20.820> back

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
so again my reaction is to go right back

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.420 
so again my reaction is to go right back
to<00:03:21.120> it<00:03:21.360> you<00:03:22.290> just<00:03:22.320> picked<00:03:22.680> me<00:03:22.860> up<00:03:22.890> in<00:03:23.190> a<00:03:23.250> way<00:03:23.400> I

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
to it you just picked me up in a way I

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:29.420 
to it you just picked me up in a way I
go<00:03:23.780> if<00:03:24.780> I<00:03:25.459> run<00:03:26.459> away<00:03:27.140> by<00:03:28.140> collapsing<00:03:28.830> he<00:03:29.220> just

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
go if I run away by collapsing he just

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.420 
go if I run away by collapsing he just
follows<00:03:29.820> it<00:03:29.970> right<00:03:30.150> in<00:03:30.680> but<00:03:31.680> if<00:03:31.769> I<00:03:31.920> meet<00:03:32.160> his

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
follows it right in but if I meet his

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.850 
follows it right in but if I meet his
force<00:03:32.850> still<00:03:33.780> give<00:03:33.930> him<00:03:34.050> these<00:03:34.230> contact

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
force still give him these contact

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.580 
force still give him these contact
points<00:03:35.370> but<00:03:36.090> say<00:03:36.390> no<00:03:36.870> I'm<00:03:36.989> gonna<00:03:37.110> take<00:03:37.380> it<00:03:37.560> down

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
points but say no I'm gonna take it down

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.960 
points but say no I'm gonna take it down
and<00:03:38.310> i<00:03:39.120> neutralize<00:03:39.660> as<00:03:40.170> he<00:03:40.320> goes<00:03:40.500> down<00:03:40.530> I<00:03:41.220> have

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
and i neutralize as he goes down I have

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.509 
and i neutralize as he goes down I have
a<00:03:42.000> little<00:03:42.330> bit<00:03:42.540> different<00:03:43.019> chance<00:03:43.320> to<00:03:43.739> resolve

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
a little bit different chance to resolve

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.710 
a little bit different chance to resolve
the<00:03:44.700> situation<00:03:45.470> so<00:03:46.910> it<00:03:47.910> opens<00:03:48.239> the<00:03:48.390> window

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
the situation so it opens the window

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.050 
the situation so it opens the window
right<00:03:49.200> it's<00:03:49.380> not<00:03:49.530> the<00:03:49.590> complete<00:03:49.950> solution<00:03:50.250> but

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
right it's not the complete solution but

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.790 
right it's not the complete solution but
instead<00:03:51.390> of<00:03:51.450> again<00:03:52.019> one<00:03:52.200> more<00:03:52.290> time<00:03:52.350> so<00:03:52.769> you

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
instead of again one more time so you

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.740 
instead of again one more time so you
see<00:03:53.040> it<00:03:53.130> from<00:03:53.400> several<00:03:54.180> different<00:03:54.450> points<00:03:54.570> of

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
see it from several different points of

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.110 
see it from several different points of
view<00:03:54.930> even<00:03:55.739> if<00:03:55.860> it's<00:03:56.010> more<00:03:56.190> subtle<00:03:56.489> right<00:03:56.850> even

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
view even if it's more subtle right even

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.030 
view even if it's more subtle right even
if<00:03:57.209> I<00:03:57.330> stiff<00:03:57.810> in<00:03:58.019> a<00:03:58.110> little<00:03:58.470> bit<00:03:58.590> as<00:03:58.709> he<00:03:58.739> comes

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
if I stiff in a little bit as he comes
