Lighting's<00:01:47.579> exactly<00:01:48.030> same<00:01:48.210> as<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.390> was<00:01:48.479> before

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
Lighting's exactly same as it was before

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.410 
Lighting's exactly same as it was before
I<00:01:49.020> may<00:01:49.710> need<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.430> make<00:01:50.579> some<00:01:50.729> changes<00:01:50.970> there

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
I may need to make some changes there

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.880 
I may need to make some changes there
but<00:01:51.930> we<00:01:52.020> think<00:01:52.170> about<00:01:52.380> that<00:01:52.560> in<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.799> minute

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
but we think about that in a minute

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.240 
but we think about that in a minute
let's<00:01:53.700> try<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.000> shot<00:01:54.290> with<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.560> camera<00:01:55.920> right

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
let's try a shot with the camera right

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.660 
let's try a shot with the camera right
down<00:01:56.520> here<00:01:56.790> looking<00:01:57.149> up<00:01:57.390> at<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.630> car<00:01:58.460> well<00:01:59.460> the

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
down here looking up at the car well the

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.310 
down here looking up at the car well the
first<00:01:59.700> thing<00:02:00.000> we<00:02:00.210> notice<00:02:00.600> apart<00:02:00.990> for<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.170> much

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
first thing we notice apart for the much

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.260 
first thing we notice apart for the much
more<00:02:01.500> dramatic<00:02:01.950> effect<00:02:02.310> is<00:02:02.579> that<00:02:03.090> the

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
more dramatic effect is that the

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.359 
more dramatic effect is that the
reflection<00:02:04.110> of<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.259> car<00:02:04.500> is<00:02:04.770> much<00:02:05.100> much

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
reflection of the car is much much

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.950 
reflection of the car is much much
stronger<00:02:05.640> than<00:02:05.790> it<00:02:05.909> was<00:02:06.090> this<00:02:06.540> is<00:02:06.659> all<00:02:06.780> just

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
stronger than it was this is all just

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.100 
stronger than it was this is all just
down<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.259> camera<00:02:07.530> angle<00:02:08.450> okay<00:02:09.450> we're<00:02:09.869> now

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
down to camera angle okay we're now

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.830 
down to camera angle okay we're now
getting<00:02:10.410> I<00:02:10.830> think<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.489> beginnings<00:02:11.940> of<00:02:12.120> a

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
getting I think the beginnings of a

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.710 
getting I think the beginnings of a
usable<00:02:13.260> shot<00:02:13.910> the<00:02:14.910> lots<00:02:15.120> of<00:02:15.239> other<00:02:15.330> things<00:02:15.420> we

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
usable shot the lots of other things we

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.740 
usable shot the lots of other things we
can<00:02:15.840> do<00:02:16.019> of<00:02:16.140> course<00:02:16.730> we<00:02:17.730> could<00:02:18.060> change<00:02:18.510> the

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
can do of course we could change the

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.330 
can do of course we could change the
background<00:02:18.900> totally<00:02:19.650> we<00:02:19.769> don't<00:02:19.920> have<00:02:20.099> to<00:02:20.220> have

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
background totally we don't have to have

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.850 
background totally we don't have to have
a<00:02:20.370> reflective<00:02:20.849> background<00:02:21.239> at<00:02:21.390> all<00:02:21.680> you<00:02:22.680> don't

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
a reflective background at all you don't

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.650 
a reflective background at all you don't
come<00:02:23.250> to<00:02:23.370> that<00:02:23.519> you<00:02:23.700> don't<00:02:23.879> actually<00:02:24.060> need<00:02:24.269> to

come to that you don't actually need to

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.170 
come to that you don't actually need to
have<00:02:24.840> a<00:02:25.470> plain<00:02:25.890> background<00:02:26.160> you<00:02:26.879> could<00:02:27.000> build

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
have a plain background you could build

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.240 
have a plain background you could build
a<00:02:27.360> road<00:02:27.599> if<00:02:28.140> you<00:02:28.379> do<00:02:28.560> you've<00:02:28.800> got<00:02:28.830> to<00:02:29.099> be<00:02:29.220> very

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
a road if you do you've got to be very

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.750 
a road if you do you've got to be very
very<00:02:29.519> careful<00:02:29.879> to<00:02:30.269> use<00:02:30.299> a<00:02:30.480> road<00:02:30.840> that<00:02:31.459> is<00:02:32.459> made

very careful to use a road that is made

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
use pebbles or something because they

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.210 
use pebbles or something because they
look<00:02:36.360> like<00:02:36.510> boulders<00:02:37.049> and<00:02:37.200> in<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.799> shot<00:02:38.040> this

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
look like boulders and in the shot this

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.210 
look like boulders and in the shot this
size<00:02:38.540> you<00:02:39.540> could<00:02:39.660> also<00:02:39.840> use<00:02:40.080> sand<00:02:40.709> you<00:02:40.950> know<00:02:41.069> if

we can introduce light from different

directions one thing we can do is we can

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.199 
directions one thing we can do is we can
place<00:03:18.180> a<00:03:18.209> light<00:03:18.540> underneath<00:03:19.019> the<00:03:19.319> table

shining up through its now ok is

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.009 
shining up through its now ok is
probably<00:03:23.459> not<00:03:23.790> appropriate<00:03:24.030> for<00:03:24.540> this<00:03:24.750> type

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
probably not appropriate for this type

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:28.039 
probably not appropriate for this type
of<00:03:25.049> shot<00:03:25.459> but<00:03:26.459> it<00:03:27.060> is<00:03:27.239> a<00:03:27.269> good<00:03:27.480> idea<00:03:27.510> to<00:03:27.900> show

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
of shot but it is a good idea to show

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.199 
of shot but it is a good idea to show
you<00:03:28.139> what<00:03:28.260> we<00:03:28.380> can<00:03:28.560> achieve<00:03:28.650> I've<00:03:29.130> now<00:03:29.849> placed

shooting table before we go any further
at<00:03:38.849> all<00:03:39.030> I'm<00:03:39.540> going<00:03:39.780> to<00:03:39.840> place<00:03:40.049> a<00:03:40.290> very<00:03:40.500> heavy

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
at all I'm going to place a very heavy

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:44.409 
at all I'm going to place a very heavy
cast<00:03:41.340> iron<00:03:41.579> weight<00:03:41.940> on<00:03:42.750> the<00:03:43.049> stand<00:03:43.349> because

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:44.419 
cast iron weight on the stand because

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:47.440 
cast iron weight on the stand because
otherwise<00:03:45.419> you'll<00:03:46.079> probably<00:03:46.380> fall<00:03:46.739> over<00:03:47.130> and

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
otherwise you'll probably fall over and

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.670 
otherwise you'll probably fall over and
these<00:03:48.450> things<00:03:48.660> aren't<00:03:48.900> cheap<00:03:49.019> and<00:03:49.440> if<00:03:49.530> all

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
these things aren't cheap and if all

00:03:49.680 --> 00:04:00.110 
these things aren't cheap and if all
over<00:03:57.889> well<00:03:58.889> as<00:03:59.069> you<00:03:59.250> can<00:03:59.310> see<00:03:59.519> that<00:03:59.700> seriously

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
over well as you can see that seriously

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.289 
over well as you can see that seriously
ever<00:04:00.359> done<00:04:00.599> but<00:04:01.169> you<00:04:01.230> get<00:04:01.410> the<00:04:01.470> idea<00:04:02.090> let's<00:04:03.090> put

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
ever done but you get the idea let's put

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.539 
ever done but you get the idea let's put
a<00:04:03.329> neutral<00:04:03.720> density<00:04:03.810> jet<00:04:04.290> over<00:04:04.440> it<00:04:04.709> to<00:04:05.130> reduce

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
a neutral density jet over it to reduce

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:07.909 
a neutral density jet over it to reduce
the<00:04:05.730> light<00:04:05.880> power<00:04:06.209> at<00:04:07.200> the<00:04:07.319> same<00:04:07.590> time<00:04:07.799> I'm

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:07.919 
the light power at the same time I'm

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:09.680 
the light power at the same time I'm
going<00:04:08.069> to<00:04:08.160> turn<00:04:08.370> off<00:04:08.609> the<00:04:08.849> modeling<00:04:09.150> light<00:04:09.329> so

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
going to turn off the modeling light so

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.830 
going to turn off the modeling light so
the<00:04:09.959> gel<00:04:10.440> doesn't<00:04:10.799> get<00:04:10.919> over<00:04:11.130> hot<00:04:11.310> I've<00:04:12.120> never

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
the gel doesn't get over hot I've never

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.279 
the gel doesn't get over hot I've never
juiced<00:04:13.260> the<00:04:13.730> night<00:04:14.730> empower<00:04:15.209> by<00:04:15.900> one<00:04:16.139> and<00:04:16.229> a

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
juiced the night empower by one and a

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.520 
juiced the night empower by one and a
half<00:04:16.320> stops<00:04:16.769> using<00:04:16.979> neutral<00:04:17.430> density<00:04:17.519> gel<00:04:17.970> as

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
half stops using neutral density gel as

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.099 
half stops using neutral density gel as
you<00:04:19.530> can<00:04:19.650> see<00:04:19.859> it's<00:04:20.070> near<00:04:20.659> lessen<00:04:21.659> the<00:04:21.780> effect

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
you can see it's near lessen the effect

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:25.340 
you can see it's near lessen the effect
it<00:04:22.530> still<00:04:23.039> is<00:04:23.250> a<00:04:23.280> bit<00:04:23.460> white<00:04:23.729> underneath

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350 
it still is a bit white underneath

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:27.320 
it still is a bit white underneath
now<00:04:25.560> you<00:04:25.980> use<00:04:26.250> this<00:04:26.430> effect<00:04:26.790> if<00:04:26.970> you're<00:04:27.120> going

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
now you use this effect if you're going

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.880 
now you use this effect if you're going
to<00:04:27.390> crop<00:04:27.690> it<00:04:27.720> so<00:04:28.110> that<00:04:28.260> you<00:04:28.320> didn't<00:04:28.560> show<00:04:28.710> any

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
to crop it so that you didn't show any

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.500 
to crop it so that you didn't show any
reflections<00:04:29.400> at<00:04:29.550> all<00:04:29.730> or<00:04:29.910> you<00:04:29.970> might<00:04:30.120> turn<00:04:30.420> the

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
reflections at all or you might turn the

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.630 
reflections at all or you might turn the
lighting<00:04:31.020> power<00:04:31.200> up<00:04:31.320> slightly<00:04:31.620> what<00:04:32.550> I'm

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
lighting power up slightly what I'm

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.400 
lighting power up slightly what I'm
going<00:04:32.820> to<00:04:32.850> do<00:04:33.000> now<00:04:33.240> isn't<00:04:33.780> going<00:04:33.900> to<00:04:33.960> put<00:04:34.170> a

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
going to do now isn't going to put a

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.640 
going to do now isn't going to put a
blue<00:04:35.250> gel<00:04:35.820> over<00:04:36.480> that<00:04:36.630> underneath<00:04:37.320> light

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
blue gel over that underneath light

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.230 
blue gel over that underneath light
which<00:04:38.100> will<00:04:38.280> give<00:04:38.430> us<00:04:38.460> quite<00:04:38.910> an<00:04:39.000> interesting

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
which will give us quite an interesting

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.270 
which will give us quite an interesting
lighting<00:04:39.780> effect<00:04:40.050> bit<00:04:40.770> weird<00:04:41.010> and<00:04:41.160> wonderful

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
lighting effect bit weird and wonderful

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.030 
lighting effect bit weird and wonderful
and<00:04:41.790> say<00:04:42.600> I'm<00:04:42.900> not<00:04:42.930> saying<00:04:43.320> you<00:04:43.440> should<00:04:43.680> use

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
and say I'm not saying you should use

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:45.710 
and say I'm not saying you should use
this<00:04:44.220> type<00:04:44.430> of<00:04:44.460> effect<00:04:44.820> but<00:04:45.420> it's<00:04:45.570> something

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
this type of effect but it's something

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.150 
this type of effect but it's something
worth<00:04:46.170> considering<00:04:46.530> and<00:04:48.770> here's<00:04:49.770> that<00:04:49.950> blue

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
worth considering and here's that blue

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.400 
worth considering and here's that blue
gel<00:04:50.490> now<00:04:50.820> if<00:04:51.090> you<00:04:51.240> want<00:04:51.420> to<00:04:51.480> increase<00:04:51.780> that

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
gel now if you want to increase that

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.600 
gel now if you want to increase that
effect<00:04:53.510> we<00:04:54.510> simply<00:04:54.750> give<00:04:55.110> less<00:04:55.380> exposure<00:04:55.830> to

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
effect we simply give less exposure to

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.500 
effect we simply give less exposure to
the<00:04:56.850> light<00:04:57.570> coming<00:04:57.870> from<00:04:57.960> beneath<00:04:58.350> as<00:04:59.510> with

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
the light coming from beneath as with

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.050 
the light coming from beneath as with
this<00:05:00.720> one<00:05:01.490> okay<00:05:02.490> there<00:05:02.700> are<00:05:02.730> lots<00:05:02.880> of<00:05:02.940> other

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
this one okay there are lots of other

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.340 
this one okay there are lots of other
things<00:05:03.150> we<00:05:03.450> can<00:05:03.540> do<00:05:03.690> as<00:05:03.810> well<00:05:03.960> let's<00:05:04.170> try

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
things we can do as well let's try

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:08.390 
things we can do as well let's try
something<00:05:04.890> else<00:05:05.100> now<00:05:05.870> well<00:05:06.870> you<00:05:07.050> can<00:05:07.400> create

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
something else now well you can create

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.460 
something else now well you can create
special<00:05:08.820> effects<00:05:09.060> of<00:05:09.210> your<00:05:09.330> own<00:05:09.480> if<00:05:10.110> you<00:05:10.320> have

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:10.470 
special effects of your own if you have

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:11.990 
special effects of your own if you have
an<00:05:10.590> assistant<00:05:10.800> who<00:05:11.070> can<00:05:11.340> blow<00:05:11.490> some<00:05:11.670> cigarette

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
an assistant who can blow some cigarette

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.660 
an assistant who can blow some cigarette
smoke<00:05:12.330> around<00:05:12.600> the<00:05:13.530> car<00:05:13.800> you've<00:05:14.400> got<00:05:14.550> this

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:14.670 
smoke around the car you've got this

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.570 
smoke around the car you've got this
little<00:05:14.880> misty<00:05:15.300> effect<00:05:15.600> or<00:05:16.590> you<00:05:16.890> can<00:05:17.070> use<00:05:17.100> steam

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
little misty effect or you can use steam

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.900 
little misty effect or you can use steam
I<00:05:18.080> use<00:05:19.080> a<00:05:19.110> little<00:05:19.500> steam<00:05:20.160> cleaner<00:05:20.490> for<00:05:20.790> this

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
I use a little steam cleaner for this

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.970 
I use a little steam cleaner for this
which<00:05:21.120> is<00:05:21.300> quite<00:05:21.480> effective<00:05:21.630> and<00:05:22.170> now<00:05:22.830> I've

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:22.980 
which is quite effective and now I've

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.410 
which is quite effective and now I've
moved<00:05:23.250> a<00:05:23.340> car<00:05:23.550> two<00:05:23.730> different<00:05:24.060> angled

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:24.420 
moved a car two different angled

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.690 
moved a car two different angled
entirely<00:05:25.080> so<00:05:25.890> the<00:05:25.980> car<00:05:26.220> is<00:05:26.250> now<00:05:26.460> coming

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:26.700 
entirely so the car is now coming

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.360 
entirely so the car is now coming
straight<00:05:27.210> at<00:05:27.270> us<00:05:27.420> or<00:05:27.720> pretty<00:05:27.930> much<00:05:28.100> of<00:05:29.100> course

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
straight at us or pretty much of course

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:30.980 
straight at us or pretty much of course
I've<00:05:29.550> had<00:05:29.730> to<00:05:29.850> move<00:05:30.030> the<00:05:30.330> honey<00:05:30.690> comb<00:05:30.930> grid

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
I've had to move the honey comb grid

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.580 
I've had to move the honey comb grid
light<00:05:31.920> as<00:05:32.130> well<00:05:32.840> because<00:05:33.840> the<00:05:34.080> position<00:05:34.470> of

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
light as well because the position of

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:37.580 
light as well because the position of
the<00:05:34.800> light<00:05:35.220> controls<00:05:35.970> the<00:05:36.300> effect<00:05:36.570> very<00:05:37.440> very

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:37.590 
the light controls the effect very very

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:39.200 
the light controls the effect very very
precisely<00:05:38.010> so<00:05:38.430> it<00:05:38.550> got<00:05:38.730> to<00:05:38.850> be<00:05:38.910> in<00:05:39.000> the<00:05:39.090> right

precisely so it got to be in the right
place<00:05:39.390> I<00:05:39.810> still<00:05:40.800> got<00:05:40.980> the<00:05:41.070> camera<00:05:41.460> square<00:05:41.970> or

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
place I still got the camera square or

place I still got the camera square or
no<00:05:42.450> more<00:05:42.660> or<00:05:42.720> less<00:05:42.840> square<00:05:43.110> on<00:05:43.230> two<00:05:43.410> subjects

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
no more or less square on two subjects

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.200 
no more or less square on two subjects
of<00:05:43.980> course<00:05:44.160> we<00:05:44.340> want<00:05:44.490> to<00:05:44.610> give<00:05:44.730> an<00:05:44.820> illusion

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
of course we want to give an illusion

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.330 
of course we want to give an illusion
speed<00:05:45.510> we<00:05:46.260> can<00:05:46.410> change<00:05:46.620> the<00:05:46.860> angle<00:05:47.130> of<00:05:47.220> the

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
speed we can change the angle of the

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:49.070 
speed we can change the angle of the
camera<00:05:47.520> as<00:05:47.760> well<00:05:47.790> let's<00:05:48.450> do<00:05:48.630> that<00:05:48.780> in<00:05:48.960> the<00:05:49.050> next

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
camera as well let's do that in the next

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.470 
camera as well let's do that in the next
shot
