00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
come to interactive render region and it

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.219 
come to interactive render region and it
comes<00:01:02.969> up<00:01:03.059> this<00:01:03.210> little<00:01:03.420> box<00:01:03.629> now<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.019> can

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
screen but I don't I tend to have it

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.710 
screen but I don't I tend to have it
kind<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:12.090> like<00:01:12.530> in<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.590> middle<00:01:14.479> so<00:01:15.479> then<00:01:15.600> what

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
kind of like in the middle so then what

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.640 
kind of like in the middle so then what
you<00:01:15.810> could<00:01:15.930> do<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.080> you<00:01:16.170> can<00:01:16.229> start<00:01:16.530> making

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
you could do is you can start making

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.149 
you could do is you can start making
adjustments<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.930> and<00:01:18.930> then<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.860> will<00:01:19.979> render

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
adjustments and and then it will render

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.240 
adjustments and and then it will render
out<00:01:20.540> whatever<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.780> camera<00:01:22.110> sees<00:01:22.400> here<00:01:25.250> now

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
out whatever the camera sees here now

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.950 
out whatever the camera sees here now
see<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.759> scene<00:01:27.030> needs<00:01:27.210> global<00:01:27.750> illumination

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
see the scene needs global illumination

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.450 
see the scene needs global illumination
and<00:01:29.000> but<00:01:30.000> I've<00:01:30.329> taken<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:30.780> off<00:01:30.869> just<00:01:31.140> for<00:01:31.320> the

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
and but I've taken it off just for the

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.460 
and but I've taken it off just for the
purpose<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.729> tutorial<00:01:32.909> I<00:01:33.390> would<00:01:34.020> take<00:01:34.350> too

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
purpose of the tutorial I would take too

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.940 
purpose of the tutorial I would take too
much<00:01:34.530> time<00:01:34.829> up<00:01:36.229> it<00:01:37.229> still<00:01:37.470> takes<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.770> bit<00:01:37.920> of

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
much time up it still takes a bit of

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.480 
much time up it still takes a bit of
time<00:01:38.159> because<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.450> item<00:01:39.799> so<00:01:40.799> yeah<00:01:40.950> that's<00:01:41.189> as

time because the item so yeah that's as
you<00:01:41.700> can<00:01:41.850> see<00:01:44.329> is<00:01:45.329> that<00:01:45.390> done<00:01:45.689> no<00:01:45.930> this<00:01:46.170> modern
