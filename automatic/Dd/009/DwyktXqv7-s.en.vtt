00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
effective as it is a one example that I

from<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.590> DB<00:00:50.399> that's<00:00:50.640> playing<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.030> flat<00:00:51.270> I

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
from that DB that's playing the flat I

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.600 
from that DB that's playing the flat I
can<00:00:51.899> lead<00:00:52.079> them<00:00:52.170> towards<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.649> sidelines<00:00:53.219> and

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
can lead them towards the sidelines and

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.810 
can lead them towards the sidelines and
the<00:00:54.300> safety<00:00:55.289> can<00:00:55.649> never<00:00:55.860> get<00:00:56.100> over<00:00:56.219> their<00:00:56.520> time

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820

the safety can never get over their time
this<00:00:57.480> year<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:58.109> can't<00:00:58.620> lead<00:00:58.859> them<00:00:59.039> close<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.670> the

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
this year I can't lead them close to the

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.240 
this year I can't lead them close to the
sidelines<00:01:00.239> again<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.440> tight<00:01:01.680> end<00:01:01.859> streak

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
sidelines again and the tight end streak

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.850 
sidelines again and the tight end streak
of<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.520> middle<00:01:02.820> is<00:01:03.260> less<00:01:04.260> effective<00:01:04.619> than

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
of the middle is less effective than

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.690 
of the middle is less effective than
I've<00:01:05.250> ever<00:01:05.280> seen<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:06.380> in<00:01:07.380> madden<00:01:07.770> NFL<00:01:08.130> 13<00:01:08.159> so

franchise<00:01:19.259> whether<00:01:19.860> we<00:01:20.040> would<00:01:20.100> implement<00:01:20.400> the

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
franchise whether we would implement the

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.980 
franchise whether we would implement the
feature<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.090> then<00:01:21.180> we<00:01:21.270> move<00:01:21.450> on<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.659> something

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
feature and then we move on to something

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.570 
feature and then we move on to something
else<00:01:22.229> we<00:01:22.740> don't<00:01:22.799> want<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.070> do<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.189> anymore

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
the total control passing feature but it

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.730 
the total control passing feature but it
was<00:01:50.640> overpowered<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.509> our<00:01:51.960> d-backs<00:01:52.380> didn't

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
was overpowered and our d-backs didn't

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.590 
was overpowered and our d-backs didn't
really<00:01:53.040> have<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.250> right<00:01:53.520> nai<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:53.909> react<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.360> it

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
really have the right nai to react to it

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.870 
really have the right nai to react to it
appropriately<00:01:55.320> so<00:01:56.009> what<00:01:56.130> we<00:01:56.250> did<00:01:56.399> is<00:01:56.460> we<00:01:56.579> sort

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
appropriately so what we did is we sort

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.730 
appropriately so what we did is we sort
of<00:01:56.939> turned<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.420> back<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.630> little<00:01:57.810> bit<00:01:58.140> so<00:01:58.619> it

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
of turned it back a little bit so it

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.080 
of turned it back a little bit so it
wasn't<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.130> kind<00:01:59.280> of<00:01:59.430> thing<00:01:59.640> that<00:01:59.670> you<00:01:59.909> could

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
wasn't the kind of thing that you could

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.060 
wasn't the kind of thing that you could
never<00:02:00.360> defend<00:02:00.869> it<00:02:01.380> was<00:02:01.530> still<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.799> kind<00:02:01.979> of

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
never defend it was still the kind of

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.660 
never defend it was still the kind of
thing<00:02:02.189> that<00:02:02.219> you

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
thing that you

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.249 
thing that you
used<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:02.970> get<00:02:03.030> more<00:02:03.180> powerful<00:02:03.689> passing<00:02:04.110> more

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
used to get more powerful passing more

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.990 
used to get more powerful passing more
control<00:02:04.619> for<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.830> user<00:02:05.040> but<00:02:05.610> at<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.790> same

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
control for the user but at the same

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.789 
control for the user but at the same
time<00:02:06.270> we<00:02:06.780> didn't<00:02:06.990> want<00:02:07.140> it<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.290> be<00:02:07.409> this<00:02:07.530> thing

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
time we didn't want it to be this thing

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.469 
time we didn't want it to be this thing
that<00:02:07.979> ruined<00:02:08.280> competitive<00:02:08.819> or<00:02:08.910> online<00:02:09.179> play

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
that ruined competitive or online play

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.420 
that ruined competitive or online play
essentially<00:02:10.470> becoming<00:02:10.800> an<00:02:10.979> indefensible

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
essentially becoming an indefensible

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.970 
essentially becoming an indefensible
offensive<00:02:12.239> weapon<00:02:12.569> so<00:02:13.170> we've<00:02:13.349> done<00:02:13.560> and<00:02:13.890> it

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
offensive weapon so we've done and it

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.770 
offensive weapon so we've done and it
was<00:02:14.010> mostly<00:02:14.459> based<00:02:14.670> on<00:02:14.819> you<00:02:15.000> guys<00:02:15.120> input<00:02:15.599> is

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
was mostly based on you guys input is

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.449 
was mostly based on you guys input is
tone<00:02:16.260> some<00:02:16.530> of<00:02:16.620> those<00:02:16.680> things<00:02:16.890> back<00:02:17.130> a<00:02:17.190> little

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
tone some of those things back a little

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.760 
tone some of those things back a little
bit<00:02:17.610> so<00:02:17.790> it's<00:02:17.940> not<00:02:18.090> so<00:02:18.330> overpowered<00:02:19.020> nice

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
bit so it's not so overpowered nice

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.130 
bit so it's not so overpowered nice
knows<00:02:20.100> how<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.670> other<00:02:21.030> thing<00:02:21.270> I<00:02:21.390> noticed<00:02:21.840> was

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
knows how the other thing I noticed was

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.620 
knows how the other thing I noticed was
well<00:02:23.069> I<00:02:23.100> want<00:02:23.310> such<00:02:23.489> more<00:02:23.670> interceptions<00:02:24.150> I

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
well I want such more interceptions I

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.960 
well I want such more interceptions I
noticed<00:02:25.290> that<00:02:25.440> I<00:02:25.650> can't<00:02:26.130> quite<00:02:26.310> figure<00:02:26.610> it<00:02:26.760> out

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
noticed that I can't quite figure it out

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.490 
noticed that I can't quite figure it out
but<00:02:27.209> interceptions<00:02:27.870> are<00:02:28.020> a<00:02:28.050> little<00:02:28.290> bit

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
but interceptions are a little bit

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.770 
but interceptions are a little bit
different<00:02:28.950> than<00:02:29.400> they<00:02:29.580> were<00:02:29.760> last<00:02:29.790> year<00:02:30.480> can

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
different than they were last year can

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.320 
different than they were last year can
you<00:02:30.900> explain<00:02:31.230> what<00:02:31.440> yeah<00:02:32.310> well<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:33.120> first

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
you explain what yeah well the first

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.059 
you explain what yeah well the first
thing<00:02:33.420> is<00:02:33.569> and<00:02:33.959> it<00:02:34.050> was<00:02:34.110> again<00:02:34.500> based<00:02:34.860> on

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
thing is and it was again based on

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.590 
thing is and it was again based on
feedback<00:02:35.280> from<00:02:35.519> the<00:02:35.760> community<00:02:35.910> and<00:02:36.330> the<00:02:36.390> game

feedback from the community and the game

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.449 
feedback from the community and the game
changes<00:02:37.110> and<00:02:37.620> it's<00:02:37.739> an<00:02:37.830> important<00:02:38.250> point

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
changes and it's an important point

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
told us was ball Hawks too powerful and

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.259 
told us was ball Hawks too powerful and
what<00:02:52.380> you<00:02:52.500> said<00:02:52.709> was<00:02:52.950> people<00:02:53.610> are<00:02:53.730> holding<00:02:53.910> Y

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
what you said was people are holding Y

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.059 
what you said was people are holding Y
from<00:02:54.600> the<00:02:54.690> snap<00:02:54.989> and<00:02:55.350> we're<00:02:55.739> like<00:02:55.860> wow<00:02:55.920> that's

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
from the snap and we're like wow that's

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:57.170 
from the snap and we're like wow that's
not<00:02:56.160> even<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.459> way<00:02:56.549> it's<00:02:56.700> supposed<00:02:56.970> to<00:02:57.090> work

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
not even the way it's supposed to work

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.699 
not even the way it's supposed to work
you're<00:02:57.810> supposed<00:02:58.049> to<00:02:58.170> hold<00:02:58.380> it<00:02:58.530> when<00:02:58.650> the

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
you're supposed to hold it when the

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.650 
you're supposed to hold it when the
balls<00:02:58.890> in<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.160> air<00:02:59.299> essentially<00:03:00.299> being<00:03:00.450> able

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
balls in the air essentially being able

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.840 
balls in the air essentially being able
to<00:03:00.720> hold<00:03:00.870> it<00:03:01.019> from<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.290> snap<00:03:01.560> was<00:03:01.769> a<00:03:01.799> bug<00:03:02.130> so<00:03:02.760> we

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
to hold it from the snap was a bug so we

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.309 
to hold it from the snap was a bug so we
went<00:03:02.970> in<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:03.180> fix<00:03:03.480> that<00:03:03.660> and<00:03:03.690> now<00:03:03.989> you<00:03:04.049> can

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
went in and fix that and now you can

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.320 
went in and fix that and now you can
only<00:03:04.530> activate<00:03:05.280> it<00:03:05.549> once<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:05.880> pass<00:03:06.060> has<00:03:06.299> been

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
only activate it once the pass has been

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.380 
only activate it once the pass has been
thrown<00:03:06.810> which<00:03:07.320> fundamentally<00:03:08.269> takes<00:03:09.269> an

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
thrown which fundamentally takes an

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.090 
thrown which fundamentally takes an
overpowered<00:03:10.019> defensive<00:03:10.530> feature<00:03:10.680> that<00:03:10.950> a<00:03:10.980> lot

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
overpowered defensive feature that a lot

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.430 
overpowered defensive feature that a lot
of<00:03:11.130> people<00:03:11.220> didn't<00:03:11.670> like<00:03:11.700> and<00:03:12.239> tones<00:03:13.109> it<00:03:13.290> back

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
of people didn't like and tones it back

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.380 
of people didn't like and tones it back
to<00:03:13.590> something<00:03:13.739> that's<00:03:13.859> more<00:03:14.040> manageable<00:03:14.390> the

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
to something that's more manageable the

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.270 
to something that's more manageable the
other<00:03:15.570> thing<00:03:15.840> we<00:03:15.959> did<00:03:16.140> this<00:03:16.260> year<00:03:16.560> and<00:03:16.799> I<00:03:16.859> think

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
other thing we did this year and I think

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.340 
other thing we did this year and I think
in<00:03:17.910> order<00:03:18.120> to<00:03:18.329> be<00:03:18.450> a<00:03:18.720> little<00:03:19.049> bit<00:03:19.200> more

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
in order to be a little bit more

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:20.840 
in order to be a little bit more
effective<00:03:19.859> and<00:03:20.010> sort<00:03:20.400> of<00:03:20.459> give<00:03:20.609> you<00:03:20.700> different

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
effective and sort of give you different

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.990 
effective and sort of give you different
options<00:03:21.799> the<00:03:22.799> aggressive<00:03:23.280> like<00:03:23.489> driving<00:03:23.910> you

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
options the aggressive like driving you

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.120 
options the aggressive like driving you
aggressively<00:03:24.450> to<00:03:24.600> the<00:03:24.660> catch<00:03:24.930> point<00:03:25.260> what

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
aggressively to the catch point what

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.430 
aggressively to the catch point what
you'll<00:03:26.280> find<00:03:26.519> this<00:03:26.700> year<00:03:27.060> is<00:03:27.239> that<00:03:27.269> if<00:03:27.900> you<00:03:28.200> go

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
you'll find this year is that if you go

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.319 
you'll find this year is that if you go
into<00:03:28.620> ball<00:03:28.859> hawk<00:03:29.100> and<00:03:29.370> you<00:03:29.459> you<00:03:29.820> sort<00:03:30.060> of<00:03:30.120> make

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
into ball hawk and you you sort of make

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.330 
into ball hawk and you you sort of make
a<00:03:30.359> spatial<00:03:30.989> judgment<00:03:31.560> that<00:03:31.859> you're<00:03:32.010> not<00:03:32.190> going

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
a spatial judgment that you're not going

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.340 
a spatial judgment that you're not going
to<00:03:32.430> get<00:03:32.549> there<00:03:32.760> in<00:03:32.880> time<00:03:32.940> to<00:03:33.239> pick<00:03:33.390> up<00:03:33.570> the<00:03:34.079> past

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
to get there in time to pick up the past

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.680 
to get there in time to pick up the past
what<00:03:35.040> you<00:03:35.190> do<00:03:35.370> is<00:03:35.549> release<00:03:35.910> the<00:03:36.120> live<00:03:36.299> button

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
what you do is release the live button

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.990 
what you do is release the live button
immediately<00:03:36.810> switch<00:03:37.470> to<00:03:37.650> hit<00:03:37.829> stick<00:03:38.130> you<00:03:38.820> get

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
immediately switch to hit stick you get

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.729 
immediately switch to hit stick you get
a<00:03:39.030> cat<00:03:39.390> shackle<00:03:39.810> like<00:03:39.930> the<00:03:40.079> guy<00:03:40.200> catches<00:03:40.620> it

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
a cat shackle like the guy catches it

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.229 
a cat shackle like the guy catches it
but<00:03:40.859> then<00:03:40.950> you<00:03:41.040> hit<00:03:41.190> them<00:03:41.250> really<00:03:41.400> hard<00:03:41.519> knock

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
but then you hit them really hard knock

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.150 
but then you hit them really hard knock
the<00:03:42.420> ball<00:03:42.570> out<00:03:42.630> in<00:03:43.079> fact<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:43.709> pass<00:03:43.890> that's

the ball out in fact the pass that's

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.800 
the ball out in fact the pass that's
sort<00:03:44.370> of<00:03:44.430> like<00:03:44.489> a<00:03:44.609> new<00:03:44.850> mechanic<00:03:45.030> a<00:03:45.450> new<00:03:45.630> way<00:03:45.780> to

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
sort of like a new mechanic a new way to

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.750 
sort of like a new mechanic a new way to
defend<00:03:46.170> the<00:03:46.350> pass<00:03:46.530> if<00:03:46.859> you<00:03:47.190> realize<00:03:47.579> you're

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
defend the pass if you realize you're

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
time lay them out with the hit stick

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:52.670 
time lay them out with the hit stick
will<00:03:50.640> drop<00:03:50.850> the<00:03:50.970> ball<00:03:51.150> nice<00:03:51.750> now<00:03:52.200> can<00:03:52.410> you<00:03:52.440> talk

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
a little bit about sideline

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.030 
a little bit about sideline
interceptions<00:03:54.720> I<00:03:54.840> felt<00:03:55.290> like<00:03:55.440> that<00:03:55.590> was<00:03:55.709> a<00:03:55.739> big

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
interceptions I felt like that was a big

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.340 
interceptions I felt like that was a big
thing<00:03:56.069> this<00:03:56.459> year<00:03:56.519> it<00:03:56.940> was<00:03:57.660> frustrating<00:03:57.810> last

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
thing this year it was frustrating last

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.530

sort<00:04:01.019> of<00:04:01.079> catch<00:04:01.260> the<00:04:01.440> ball<00:04:01.620> near<00:04:01.920> the

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
sort of catch the ball near the

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.009 
sort of catch the ball near the
sidelines<00:04:02.519> how<00:04:02.970> have<00:04:03.090> you<00:04:03.209> guys<00:04:03.359> fixed<00:04:03.870> that

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
sidelines how have you guys fixed that

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:04.710 
sidelines how have you guys fixed that
and

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
and

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.050 
and
as<00:04:04.780> far<00:04:05.020> as<00:04:05.050> the<00:04:05.350> camera<00:04:05.620> turning<00:04:06.160> I<00:04:06.310> notice<00:04:06.880> is

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
as far as the camera turning I notice is

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.970 
as far as the camera turning I notice is
different<00:04:07.540> as<00:04:07.900> well<00:04:08.230> so<00:04:08.470> can<00:04:08.680> you<00:04:08.770> talk<00:04:08.920> about

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
different as well so can you talk about

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.100 
different as well so can you talk about
that<00:04:09.340> yeah<00:04:09.790> I<00:04:09.820> mean<00:04:10.180> the<00:04:10.420> main<00:04:10.600> thing<00:04:10.630> was<00:04:10.960> that

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
that yeah I mean the main thing was that

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:12.930 
that yeah I mean the main thing was that
when<00:04:11.230> that<00:04:11.290> camera<00:04:11.830> flipped<00:04:12.190> people<00:04:12.760> get

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
when that camera flipped people get

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.340 
when that camera flipped people get
disoriented<00:04:13.600> and<00:04:13.720> start<00:04:13.930> running<00:04:14.050> the<00:04:14.230> wrong

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
disoriented and start running the wrong

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:16.410 
disoriented and start running the wrong
way<00:04:14.410> so<00:04:15.130> we<00:04:15.250> did<00:04:15.400> some<00:04:15.430> changes<00:04:15.940> to<00:04:15.970> that<00:04:16.090> to

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:16.420 
way so we did some changes to that to

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:17.880 
way so we did some changes to that to
improve<00:04:16.780> it<00:04:16.900> make<00:04:17.079> a<00:04:17.109> little<00:04:17.350> bit<00:04:17.440> smoother

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
improve it make a little bit smoother

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.830 
improve it make a little bit smoother
less<00:04:18.670> likely<00:04:19.090> for<00:04:19.120> you<00:04:19.329> to<00:04:19.420> run<00:04:19.570> the<00:04:19.690> wrong

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
less likely for you to run the wrong

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.500 
less likely for you to run the wrong
direction<00:04:20.820> I'm<00:04:21.820> sorry<00:04:22.090> what<00:04:22.240> was<00:04:22.360> the<00:04:22.420> other

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
that was a system we implemented last

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.130 
that was a system we implemented last
year<00:04:27.760> the<00:04:27.880> sideline<00:04:28.270> catches<00:04:28.660> with<00:04:28.810> our<00:04:28.960> which

year the sideline catches with our which
are<00:04:29.260> catches<00:04:29.620> in<00:04:29.770> 13<00:04:30.160> but<00:04:30.910> it<00:04:31.000> wasn't<00:04:31.270> tuned

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 
are catches in 13 but it wasn't tuned

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.150 
are catches in 13 but it wasn't tuned
properly<00:04:31.660> there<00:04:32.440> were<00:04:32.530> some<00:04:32.710> bugs<00:04:32.890> in<00:04:33.040> the

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
properly there were some bugs in the

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.100 
properly there were some bugs in the
system<00:04:33.340> and<00:04:33.640> sometimes<00:04:34.030> that'll<00:04:34.240> happen<00:04:34.510> and

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
system and sometimes that'll happen and

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.300 
system and sometimes that'll happen and
what<00:04:35.260> we<00:04:35.350> did<00:04:35.500> is<00:04:35.590> we<00:04:35.620> went<00:04:35.680> and<00:04:35.920> fix<00:04:36.130> those

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
what we did is we went and fix those

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
bugs what you'll find is a lot higher
