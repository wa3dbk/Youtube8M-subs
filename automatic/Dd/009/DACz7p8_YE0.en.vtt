00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.220 
you know we we had that issue in the in
the<00:02:04.090> first<00:02:04.390> session<00:02:04.540> when<00:02:04.720> I<00:02:04.750> found<00:02:04.960> the<00:02:05.050> wall

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:05.230 
the first session when I found the wall

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.990 
the first session when I found the wall
and<00:02:05.500> evidently<00:02:06.190> the<00:02:06.340> turn<00:02:06.520> to<00:02:06.670> wall<00:02:06.820> doesn't

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
and evidently the turn to wall doesn't

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.900 
and evidently the turn to wall doesn't
like<00:02:07.180> moving<00:02:07.450> for<00:02:07.600> you<00:02:07.690> and<00:02:08.490> even<00:02:09.490> the<00:02:09.580> second

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
like moving for you and even the second

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.220 
like moving for you and even the second
practice<00:02:10.030> we<00:02:10.330> were<00:02:10.450> chasing<00:02:10.690> something<00:02:11.050> in

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
practice we were chasing something in
