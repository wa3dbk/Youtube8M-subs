Daniel and he's asking what is the
mindset<00:00:10.120> you<00:00:10.360> should<00:00:10.540> have<00:00:10.719> when<00:00:11.019> volleying

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:11.469 
mindset you should have when volleying

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:15.119 
mindset you should have when volleying
in<00:00:11.620> a<00:00:11.709> match<00:00:11.950> compared<00:00:12.519> to<00:00:12.580> practice<00:00:14.129> the

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:15.129 
in a match compared to practice the

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:17.490 
in a match compared to practice the
first<00:00:15.400> thing<00:00:15.610> is<00:00:15.759> in<00:00:15.999> practice<00:00:16.840> what<00:00:17.170> it<00:00:17.320> how

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:17.500 
first thing is in practice what it how

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.290 
first thing is in practice what it how
are<00:00:17.530> you<00:00:17.740> practicing<00:00:18.130> your<00:00:18.160> body<00:00:18.460> if<00:00:18.940> you're

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:19.300 
are you practicing your body if you're

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.580 
are you practicing your body if you're
just<00:00:19.570> hitting<00:00:19.750> bullies<00:00:20.110> down<00:00:20.290> the<00:00:20.410> middle

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:20.590 
just hitting bullies down the middle

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.470 
just hitting bullies down the middle
then<00:00:21.580> obviously<00:00:21.970> when<00:00:22.090> you're<00:00:22.180> playing<00:00:22.390> a

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:22.480 
then obviously when you're playing a

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
then obviously when you're playing a
match<00:00:22.630> you<00:00:22.810> definitely<00:00:23.170> don't<00:00:23.290> want<00:00:23.410> to<00:00:23.440> be

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:23.500 
match you definitely don't want to be

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.890 
match you definitely don't want to be
doing<00:00:23.680> that<00:00:23.770> however<00:00:24.760> if<00:00:24.970> you<00:00:25.120> build<00:00:25.420> drills

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:25.900 
doing that however if you build drills

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.740 
doing that however if you build drills
around<00:00:26.610> winning<00:00:27.610> points<00:00:28.030> with<00:00:28.180> volleys<00:00:28.510> in

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:28.750 
around winning points with volleys in

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.690 
around winning points with volleys in
training<00:00:29.350> you<00:00:29.920> got<00:00:30.070> a<00:00:30.100> count<00:00:30.400> that<00:00:30.580> you're

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:30.700 
training you got a count that you're

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:31.890 
training you got a count that you're
going<00:00:30.820> to<00:00:30.880> come<00:00:31.060> to<00:00:31.180> the<00:00:31.270> match<00:00:31.420> with<00:00:31.600> the<00:00:31.690> same

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:31.900 
going to come to the match with the same

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:34.229 
going to come to the match with the same
mindset<00:00:32.290> so<00:00:33.129> just<00:00:33.399> hitting<00:00:33.670> volleys<00:00:33.940> down<00:00:34.120> the

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
mindset so just hitting volleys down the

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:36.119 
mindset so just hitting volleys down the
middle<00:00:34.420> of<00:00:34.539> the<00:00:34.719> court<00:00:34.989> back<00:00:35.649> to<00:00:35.679> your<00:00:36.010> hitting

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:36.129 
middle of the court back to your hitting

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:38.189 
middle of the court back to your hitting
partner<00:00:36.609> you<00:00:37.329> definitely<00:00:37.719> don't<00:00:37.780> to<00:00:37.960> be<00:00:38.019> doing

00:00:38.189 --> 00:00:38.199 
partner you definitely don't to be doing

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:39.029 
partner you definitely don't to be doing
that<00:00:38.289> a<00:00:38.350> match

00:00:39.029 --> 00:00:39.039 
that a match

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:41.819 
that a match
that's<00:00:39.999> what<00:00:40.329> if<00:00:40.719> you<00:00:40.960> go<00:00:41.079> to<00:00:41.140> Tom<00:00:41.409> and<00:00:41.589> you<00:00:41.649> see

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:41.829 
that's what if you go to Tom and you see

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:43.590 
that's what if you go to Tom and you see
most<00:00:42.010> people<00:00:42.219> warming<00:00:42.699> up<00:00:42.820> they're<00:00:43.300> falling

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
most people warming up they're falling

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.329 
most people warming up they're falling
down<00:00:43.809> the<00:00:43.929> middle<00:00:44.109> they're<00:00:44.739> just<00:00:44.920> working<00:00:45.129> on

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:45.339 
down the middle they're just working on

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:47.369 
down the middle they're just working on
the<00:00:45.429> volleys<00:00:45.670> to<00:00:45.940> warm<00:00:46.120> them<00:00:46.300> up<00:00:46.359> however<00:00:46.989> in

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:47.379 
the volleys to warm them up however in

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:49.130 
the volleys to warm them up however in
training<00:00:47.800> sessions<00:00:48.010> when<00:00:48.370> you<00:00:48.460> have<00:00:48.579> time

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
training sessions when you have time

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.470 
training sessions when you have time
definitely<00:00:50.140> work<00:00:50.350> on<00:00:50.530> maybe<00:00:51.399> a<00:00:51.730> drill<00:00:52.329> where

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
definitely work on maybe a drill where

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.299 
definitely work on maybe a drill where
you<00:00:52.629> hit<00:00:52.839> the<00:00:52.870> first<00:00:53.230> one<00:00:53.319> deep<00:00:53.679> the<00:00:53.920> second

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
you hit the first one deep the second

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:56.309 
you hit the first one deep the second
one<00:00:54.399> an<00:00:54.550> angle<00:00:54.940> stuff<00:00:55.600> like<00:00:55.809> this<00:00:55.960> at<00:00:56.079> the<00:00:56.170> net

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:56.319 
one an angle stuff like this at the net

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:58.259 
one an angle stuff like this at the net
or<00:00:56.769> the<00:00:56.949> first<00:00:57.159> one<00:00:57.429> back<00:00:57.609> to<00:00:57.789> your<00:00:57.909> opponent

00:00:58.259 --> 00:00:58.269

and the second one away from your

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.739 
and the second one away from your
opponent<00:01:00.159> so<00:01:00.249> you're<00:01:00.399> working<00:01:00.550> on<00:01:00.729> first<00:01:01.479> ball

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:01.749 
opponent so you're working on first ball

00:01:01.749 --> 00:01:03.840 
opponent so you're working on first ball
deep<00:01:02.129> closing<00:01:03.129> down<00:01:03.249> on<00:01:03.429> the<00:01:03.519> net<00:01:03.670> and

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
deep closing down on the net and

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.870 
deep closing down on the net and
finishing<00:01:04.330> when<00:01:05.290> you're<00:01:05.440> playing<00:01:05.680> a<00:01:05.800> point<00:01:06.640> or

finishing when you're playing a point or

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.810 
finishing when you're playing a point or
your<00:01:07.030> when<00:01:07.780> you're<00:01:07.930> playing<00:01:08.079> a<00:01:08.200> match<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:09.610> you

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
your when you're playing a match and you

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.420 
your when you're playing a match and you
had<00:01:09.939> a<00:01:09.969> net<00:01:10.210> if<00:01:11.200> you<00:01:11.560> can't<00:01:11.829> hit<00:01:11.979> a<00:01:12.009> winner<00:01:12.250> on

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
had a net if you can't hit a winner on

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.609 
had a net if you can't hit a winner on
the<00:01:12.549> first<00:01:12.790> volley<00:01:13.090> let's<00:01:13.750> say<00:01:13.899> it's<00:01:14.350> a<00:01:14.409> hard

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:14.619 
the first volley let's say it's a hard

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:16.350 
the first volley let's say it's a hard
volley<00:01:14.829> that<00:01:14.890> says<00:01:15.159> down<00:01:15.430> here<00:01:15.460> or<00:01:15.790> it's<00:01:16.210> a

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
volley that says down here or it's a

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.929 
volley that says down here or it's a
long<00:01:16.540> one<00:01:16.689> then<00:01:17.500> you<00:01:17.740> use<00:01:18.039> that<00:01:18.250> like<00:01:18.430> a<00:01:18.460> second

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:18.939 
long one then you use that like a second

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:20.850 
long one then you use that like a second
approach<00:01:19.180> shot<00:01:19.450> you<00:01:20.140> hit<00:01:20.259> that<00:01:20.439> like<00:01:20.619> it's<00:01:20.799> a

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
approach shot you hit that like it's a

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.980 
approach shot you hit that like it's a
second<00:01:21.219> approach<00:01:21.460> shot<00:01:21.700> you<00:01:22.299> go<00:01:22.450> deep<00:01:22.750> down

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
second approach shot you go deep down

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.380 
second approach shot you go deep down
the<00:01:23.140> line<00:01:23.289> most<00:01:23.560> of<00:01:23.710> the<00:01:23.770> time<00:01:23.979> you<00:01:24.820> close<00:01:25.149> down

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
the line most of the time you close down

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.510 
the line most of the time you close down
on<00:01:25.600> the<00:01:25.689> net<00:01:25.869> and<00:01:26.079> then<00:01:26.680> if<00:01:26.799> you<00:01:26.920> have<00:01:27.070> a<00:01:27.100> second

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
on the net and then if you have a second

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.279 
on the net and then if you have a second
volley<00:01:27.700> that's<00:01:27.939> easier<00:01:28.360> then<00:01:28.990> you're<00:01:29.140> going

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:29.289 
volley that's easier then you're going

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:31.200 
volley that's easier then you're going
for<00:01:29.560> the<00:01:29.619> angle<00:01:30.009> for<00:01:30.490> the<00:01:30.579> winner<00:01:30.789> down<00:01:31.060> the

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
for the angle for the winner down the

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.410 
for the angle for the winner down the
line<00:01:31.359> away<00:01:32.049> from<00:01:32.289> the<00:01:32.380> opponent<00:01:33.060> so<00:01:34.060> the<00:01:34.149> first

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
line away from the opponent so the first

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.120 
line away from the opponent so the first
volley<00:01:34.689> if<00:01:35.020> you<00:01:35.409> can<00:01:35.590> finish<00:01:35.799> it<00:01:36.039> off

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
volley if you can finish it off

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.520 
volley if you can finish it off
definitely<00:01:37.000> you<00:01:37.479> go<00:01:37.630> for<00:01:37.840> an<00:01:37.930> angle<00:01:38.200> you<00:01:38.380> go

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
definitely you go for an angle you go
