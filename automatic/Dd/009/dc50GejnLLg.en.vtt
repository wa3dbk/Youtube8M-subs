00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:07.120
 let's see the presentation process 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:09.299
 of an antigen by the mtc type 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.299
 two 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:16.890
 a pathogen is phagocytized by the cell 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.970
 in this case the leishmania that enters 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.970
 the cell by endocytosis 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.540
 the macrophage has lysosomes that 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.570
 they contain an acidic medium the lysosome 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:31.119
 joins the in two or more 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.250
 in another part of the cell we 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.340
 we find the endoplasmic reticulum 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:39.489
 where it is synthesized molecule mcd 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:43.059
 type 2 consisting of two alpha domains 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:45.489
 and two beta once the site is synthesized 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:49.030
 binding is blocked by a protein 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:51.820
 called l and also known as string 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.550
 invariable that consists basically of two 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.610
 parts and blocks the union groove of the 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:59.500
 cee so that the own peptides do not 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.539
 can join 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.300
 once this union is produced the endorsement 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:07.390
 does not leave the endoplasmic reticulum anymore 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:10.060
 cause of the acid medium of this 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.190
 the protein and it breaks breaking 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.810
 only a short fragment in the 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.810
 union site called clip 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:30.340
 meanwhile we have to the lysosome 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.400
 has left the proteins of the pathogen to 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.830
 small peptides this vesicle joins 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:41.300
 with the endorsement of the 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:46.240
 another protein called hl to dm binds to 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:46.240
 mhp and the clip is released 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.800
 now the peptides of the pathogen can 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:55.950
 enter the union groove then 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.970
 the hc of type 2 attached to the order 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.880
 specific salt to the cell surface 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.130
 thus observing the complex in my htc 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.740
 dress 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.349
 in this case on the surface of the 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.340
 macrophage that presents it to cells 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.340
 of people 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:19.190
 as we will see later the mhp of 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.880
 type 2 consisting of the alpha domains 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.600
 1 and 2 and beta 1 and 2 presents the peptide a 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.160
 the th cell 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:31.710
 the cd4 corrector of the cell te 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.819
 recognizes the mhp molecule and other 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.329
 receiver 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:38.819
 the th cell receptor recognizes the 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:41.579
 specific antigen and recognition 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:44.099
 of both receptors triggers a 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:46.819
 cellular response that we will see in topics 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.819
 later
