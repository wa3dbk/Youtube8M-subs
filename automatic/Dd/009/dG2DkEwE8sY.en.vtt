00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.690 
take a second and as you can see it was
supposed<00:03:33.670> to<00:03:33.760> be<00:03:35.010> 370<00:03:36.010> I<00:03:36.040> missed<00:03:36.310> it<00:03:36.519> it's

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
supposed to be 370 I missed it it's

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.360 
supposed to be 370 I missed it it's
supposed<00:03:36.910> to<00:03:36.940> be<00:03:37.030> 317<00:03:37.600> and<00:03:37.810> we're<00:03:37.930> at<00:03:38.070> 333<00:03:39.070> 20

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
supposed to be 317 and we're at 333 20

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.000 
supposed to be 317 and we're at 333 20
so<00:03:40.120> the<00:03:40.330> song<00:03:40.510> is<00:03:40.540> too<00:03:40.959> long<00:03:41.320> by<00:03:41.620> just<00:03:41.830> that

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
so the song is too long by just that

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.930 
so the song is too long by just that
much<00:03:42.280> and<00:03:42.549> it<00:03:42.970> depends<00:03:43.510> on<00:03:43.630> you<00:03:43.870> know<00:03:44.820> it's<00:03:45.820> not

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
much and it depends on you know it's not

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.340 
much and it depends on you know it's not
an<00:03:46.060> exact<00:03:46.360> science<00:03:46.450> so<00:03:46.720> when<00:03:46.870> you<00:03:46.930> pick<00:03:47.140> songs

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
an exact science so when you pick songs

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:48.630 
an exact science so when you pick songs
try<00:03:47.620> to<00:03:47.680> pick<00:03:47.890> them<00:03:48.010> that<00:03:48.160> you<00:03:48.310> know<00:03:48.459> so<00:03:48.610> that

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
try to pick them that you know so that

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.550 
try to pick them that you know so that
they're<00:03:48.850> a<00:03:48.880> few<00:03:49.060> seconds<00:03:49.480> shorter<00:03:49.780> so<00:03:50.440> it

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
they're a few seconds shorter so it

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.110 
they're a few seconds shorter so it
fixes<00:03:50.980> itself<00:03:51.130> you<00:03:51.610> know<00:03:51.700> picking<00:03:51.940> an

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
fixes itself you know picking an

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.960 
fixes itself you know picking an
entirely<00:03:52.360> new<00:03:52.600> song<00:03:52.950> man<00:03:53.950> up<00:03:54.160> use<00:03:54.670> audacity

go<00:04:06.489> ahead<00:04:06.730> and<00:04:06.940> cut<00:04:07.120> off<00:04:07.239> a<00:04:07.269> couple<00:04:07.600> seconds

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
go ahead and cut off a couple seconds

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.210 
go ahead and cut off a couple seconds
from<00:04:08.019> here<00:04:08.200> so<00:04:08.410> you<00:04:08.500> just<00:04:08.680> click<00:04:09.010> and<00:04:09.160> drag

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
from here so you just click and drag

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.190 
from here so you just click and drag
just<00:04:09.640> like<00:04:09.820> that<00:04:10.030> press<00:04:10.810> the<00:04:10.930> Delete<00:04:11.170> key

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
that's it

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.800 
that's it
and<00:04:13.340> you<00:04:13.820> know<00:04:13.910> let's<00:04:14.150> just<00:04:14.180> be<00:04:14.390> safe<00:04:14.600> with

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
and you know let's just be safe with

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.420 
and you know let's just be safe with
this<00:04:14.930> and<00:04:15.290> just<00:04:15.590> do<00:04:15.770> a<00:04:15.950> couple<00:04:16.040> more<00:04:16.310> cause<00:04:16.370> I

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430 
this and just do a couple more cause I

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.310 
this and just do a couple more cause I
don't<00:04:16.520> want<00:04:16.700> to<00:04:16.790> keep<00:04:16.850> doing<00:04:17.000> this<00:04:17.209> so<00:04:18.080> this<00:04:18.230> is

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
don't want to keep doing this so this is

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.750 
don't want to keep doing this so this is
ideal<00:04:18.590> for<00:04:18.650> songs<00:04:19.100> that<00:04:19.250> have<00:04:19.340> like<00:04:19.430> a<00:04:19.489> fade<00:04:19.730> in

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
ideal for songs that have like a fade in

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.040 
ideal for songs that have like a fade in
stuff<00:04:20.120> but<00:04:20.239> this<00:04:20.300> is<00:04:20.360> why<00:04:20.510> you<00:04:20.570> choose<00:04:20.810> songs

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:21.050 
stuff but this is why you choose songs

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:23.260 
stuff but this is why you choose songs
they're<00:04:21.230> a<00:04:21.260> couple<00:04:21.410> seconds<00:04:21.830> shorter<00:04:22.270> export

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
they're a couple seconds shorter export

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.120 
they're a couple seconds shorter export
it<00:04:23.330> to<00:04:23.390> an<00:04:23.540> mp3<00:04:23.660> we'll<00:04:24.350> call<00:04:24.530> it<00:04:24.650> -<00:04:24.830> five

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
it to an mp3 we'll call it - five

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.560 
it to an mp3 we'll call it - five
because<00:04:25.550> I<00:04:25.580> don't<00:04:25.700> know<00:04:25.760> how<00:04:25.850> many<00:04:25.910> -<00:04:26.150> the<00:04:26.300> idea

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
because I don't know how many - the idea

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.820 
because I don't know how many - the idea
just<00:04:26.720> so<00:04:26.870> doesn't<00:04:27.110> overwrite<00:04:27.500> that's<00:04:28.370> fine

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:29.830 
just so doesn't overwrite that's fine

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.830 
just so doesn't overwrite that's fine
let<00:04:30.830> it<00:04:30.920> encode<00:04:31.280> now<00:04:31.670> audacity<00:04:32.300> I<00:04:32.330> forget<00:04:32.720> if

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
let it encode now audacity I forget if

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.050 
let it encode now audacity I forget if
it<00:04:32.900> actually<00:04:33.080> lets<00:04:33.380> you<00:04:33.530> do<00:04:33.710> mp3s<00:04:34.340> by<00:04:34.700> default

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
it actually lets you do mp3s by default

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.590 
it actually lets you do mp3s by default
you<00:04:35.180> might<00:04:35.330> need<00:04:35.450> the<00:04:35.570> lame<00:04:37.390> plug-in<00:04:38.390> but

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
you might need the lame plug-in but

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.000 
you might need the lame plug-in but
that's<00:04:38.720> really<00:04:38.930> easy<00:04:39.050> to<00:04:39.290> figure<00:04:39.470> out<00:04:39.590> and

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
that's really easy to figure out and

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:42.510 
that's really easy to figure out and
just<00:04:40.250> type<00:04:40.460> it<00:04:40.580> in<00:04:40.640> Google<00:04:40.940> you'll<00:04:41.060> be<00:04:41.180> all<00:04:41.300> set

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
just type it in Google you'll be all set

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.860 
just type it in Google you'll be all set
so<00:04:43.520> we'll<00:04:43.670> take<00:04:43.820> 12<00:04:44.120> -<00:04:44.330> five<00:04:45.310> let<00:04:46.310> it<00:04:46.430> convert

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
so we'll take 12 - five let it convert

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.230 
so we'll take 12 - five let it convert
and<00:04:48.430> all<00:04:49.430> of<00:04:49.490> a<00:04:49.520> sudden<00:04:49.550> twelve<00:04:49.910> shows<00:04:50.090> up

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
and all of a sudden twelve shows up

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.920 
and all of a sudden twelve shows up
again<00:04:51.010> hit<00:04:52.010> apply<00:04:52.220> song<00:04:52.970> replaced<00:04:53.360> you're<00:04:53.750> all
