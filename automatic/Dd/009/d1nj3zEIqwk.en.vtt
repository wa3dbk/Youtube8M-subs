00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.940
 and today I'm going to be talking about art that 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.309
 endorsed tried to the different fast 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.139
 food that try photo 5 online 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.179
 basically samples referring to this 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.549
 guy called sleeves that he made like 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.800
 the your own concept of what this would be like 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.320
 use it try to people before photo 5 if 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.330
 they were working and I do not know why 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.189
 is what has not yet opened because 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.619
 something very simple is basically 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.449
 old steam the teleclub this put 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.160
 your own menu of how it would be that when 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.040
 it is in the window devote like 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.450
 for the water to the arrow this installs 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.219
 and the menu of the things you want 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.140
 buy and put of only five 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.790
 things are going to be seeing the last one put 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.920
 even his own name in the food is 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.750
 tersa 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.760
 and there is not even anyone in the window 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.559
 and keep on picking up any of 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.690
 those things it up your life that you have the 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.539
 short life is normal yes that can go 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.859
 as if nothing to see something very simple 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:53.989
 it is indicated that it is open by the 

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:55.760
 people the fast food 6 nobody in the 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.010
 stop all imagine if what 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.719
 would this put people in there that you 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.030
 it looks like that bag of food and 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.289
 you get something and you eat it there they do not have 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.909
 to be even in your invention and 

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:06.860
 just like to go through there 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.270
 to eat on long lips when 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.920
 they have to be like falling while being 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.810
 buying snacks 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.789
 it's literally a bill passed by 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.800
 with him what he needs and you go fisherman 

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:18.860
 date where you want to get off the car 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.600
 good example formally peace this and 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.580
 then be like this maybe it's not 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.770
 so much so a concept plus a 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.350
 possibility because the rockstar this is 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.750
 a Baptist carded without having to do 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.310
 his voice of duck the world as he explained 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.289
 without having to announce that you are being 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.240
 optics like you do it like that hiding 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:36.770
 as well as that patch the clips this 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.229
 infinite money and many things 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.390
 basically they took new means 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.030
 they had and they changed their minds 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.040
 it is because of the problem decides how it paints 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.140
 and why is he going to say he had 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.690
 on this side you have the big mac and the 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.190
 steak I do not know what the fuck this day like 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:54.680
 that several names that are known to be 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.360
 of mcdonald and different fast food and 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.390
 I change them to the menu that is also the 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.300
 right with the green who does not like 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.490
 that's true and if I change that for the 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.729
 2 name and that of the different password 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.950
 that there is this being the menu and 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.840
 well maybe game connector if they go to 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.820
 be giving with the steps of something well 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.880
 simple that I understand it because I do not 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:20.000
 have still done this one that I think is 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.490
 a casino like this one 63 mission 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.410
 something literally put a person 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.330
 apart from a food order and already 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.640
 I think this can be done a lot 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.920
 easy as in stores that you can 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.900
 go that you buy snacks are here you 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.550
 they give food and you really take it 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.050
 pretty simple for is basically 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.239

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.489

 photo 5 I know it's not the big thing it's not 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.250
 something that is going to change the game but something 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.010

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.810
