 black ops 2 today we will play with 

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:14.450
 a machine gun that is rather 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:15.559
 hard to play who she is not 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.550
 weak we will say because there is no 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:17.660
 true she is not weak but she is 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.270
 really very difficult to play especially 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.740
 on pc because on pc that but not finally 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:23.090

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.380
 moment if we want to shoot gusts at the 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.180

 see nobody you move a little chest of 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.780
 stays for 30 seconds at the same 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.700
 place aimed at a single point 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.700
 it's not too late, it's done 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.939

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:35.170

 Mr. few months ago that it can 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.660

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.390

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.530
 little dodge and then it's not like 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.790

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.819
 cicad grenades everywhere and no but 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.780

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.200
 corridor 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:22.450

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:24.040

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.510
 with little sway 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:43.150
 she did not marry the ops I take my 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:47.360

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.090
 I would have liked to have the 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.050
 drone of lightning I do not know I 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.170
 think me that I still had a dunk 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:04:00.220
 in this snack corner for that I think 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:00.220
 they all have to play against by snake 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:21.830
 no to the islands at full down ok another 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:23.920
 trick and now you're at theirs 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:25.790
 put a year old woman I was lucky 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.600
 the chance they know not referred I 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.700
 do not know if it's lucky or if 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:40.360
 it's just that I came across the right 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:40.360
 to go where that hurts 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.720
 launched at the front there I do not know too much 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:49.490
 how to swing them on this map the 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:51.850
 high school echoes really not very good I 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.850
 am bad 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:05:01.199
 I am really bad what is it 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.009
 as it went I'm the same blow that 

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:02.970
 I make them to each other just now 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:09.000
 finally that the other made me everything to 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:10.860
 the time we are going to make the con jostle 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.240
 said then that it 's okay to stay on 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.259
 do I think I have a shit words I 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.900
 saw them on the map I knew they 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:17.220
 were theirs but hey it's true that 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.449
 it's not very fair-play either 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.449
 stay correct 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:29.810
 yes, that's not very correct of my 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.810
 part of not killing them no but oh 

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:39.930
 no no i'm in shit i'm 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.340
 in shit I'm in the grave the 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.780
 sea ​​but I agree oh the cow 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:48.569
 had 2 in front of me he still had 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:51.780
 nothing of course the side where they really are 

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:53.759
 everywhere it's wow they are really 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:57.139
 really everywhere in these areas I have 

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:57.139
 not bad started yet this but hey 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:05.520
 I do not like these things the burst of 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:05.520
 1000 yards 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:13.840
 or how did I survive this 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.860
 we had one on the side 1 in front of 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.390
 my post who were fucking with his 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:20.410
 gun not much he did not shoot me 

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:21.490
 I really had a bowl of the bowl or 

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:23.560
 there is a little blind but I do not know 

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.600
 anyway so here I hope this 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.820
 little video you liked it was not 

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.590

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.550
 left that I do not know I had finally short 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.600
 I hope you enjoyed it 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:33.460
 a small ratio of 4 in it's not no 

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.750
 the more death and then we end up at the 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.820
