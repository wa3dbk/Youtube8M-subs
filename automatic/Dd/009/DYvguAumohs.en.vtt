is great
so<00:02:13.240> I<00:02:13.630> mold<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:14.770> hair<00:02:15.040> with<00:02:15.220> the

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
so I mold the hair with the

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.650 
so I mold the hair with the
I<00:02:15.890> have<00:02:16.280> to<00:02:16.430> make<00:02:16.610> sure<00:02:16.849> that<00:02:17.030> it's<00:02:17.180> really

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
I have to make sure that it's really

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.890 
I have to make sure that it's really
really<00:02:18.080> molded<00:02:18.650> down<00:02:18.920> good<00:02:19.459> because<00:02:20.450> my<00:02:20.599> hair

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
really molded down good because my hair

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.680 
really molded down good because my hair
is<00:02:21.140> natural<00:02:21.860> and<00:02:22.099> when<00:02:22.730> it<00:02:22.879> dries<00:02:23.060> we<00:02:23.480> know

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
is natural and when it dries we know

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.559 
is natural and when it dries we know
with<00:02:24.230> the<00:02:24.940> stocking<00:02:25.940> cap<00:02:26.120> underneath

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
with the stocking cap underneath

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.110 
with the stocking cap underneath
it'll<00:02:26.870> just<00:02:27.050> poof<00:02:27.319> right<00:02:28.069> up<00:02:28.280> and<00:02:28.519> then<00:02:28.640> this

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
it'll just poof right up and then this

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.300 
it'll just poof right up and then this
will<00:02:29.330> poof<00:02:29.629> as<00:02:29.930> well<00:02:30.560> and<00:02:30.830> just<00:02:30.980> doesn't<00:02:31.129> look

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
will poof as well and just doesn't look

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.720 
will poof as well and just doesn't look
right

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
right

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.619 
right
so<00:02:32.379> after<00:02:33.379> I<00:02:33.410> mold<00:02:33.709> it<00:02:33.920> and<00:02:34.099> I'll<00:02:35.030> put<00:02:35.299> some

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:35.629 
so after I mold it and I'll put some

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:38.800 
so after I mold it and I'll put some
paper<00:02:35.900> wraps<00:02:36.500> around<00:02:36.799> to<00:02:37.400> protect<00:02:38.269> my<00:02:38.629> own

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
paper wraps around to protect my own

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.229 
paper wraps around to protect my own
hair<00:02:39.170> and<00:02:39.470> then<00:02:39.980> I'll<00:02:40.190> put<00:02:40.459> the<00:02:40.489> stocking<00:02:41.030> cap

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
hair and then I'll put the stocking cap

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.440 
hair and then I'll put the stocking cap
on<00:02:41.450> I<00:02:41.720> keep<00:02:42.620> my<00:02:43.010> stocking<00:02:43.610> cap<00:02:43.819> on<00:02:44.060> I<00:02:44.269> don't

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:21.610 
this or whatever I do my hair every week
like<00:04:16.700> I<00:04:17.030> said<00:04:17.299> and<00:04:17.539> not<00:04:17.810> once<00:04:18.739> have<00:04:19.310> I<00:04:19.459> ever<00:04:20.620> had

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
like I said and not once have I ever had

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.370 
like I said and not once have I ever had
the<00:04:21.769> same<00:04:22.010> look<00:04:22.310> I<00:04:22.610> can't<00:04:23.120> do<00:04:23.330> it<00:04:23.510> every<00:04:24.169> time

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
the same look I can't do it every time

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.920 
the same look I can't do it every time
it's<00:04:24.650> something<00:04:25.580> that's<00:04:25.880> different<00:04:26.240> about<00:04:26.719> it

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.750 
it's something that's different about it
I<00:04:27.050> mean<00:04:27.500> it<00:04:27.650> could<00:04:27.770> be<00:04:27.919> the<00:04:28.070> side<00:04:28.310> like<00:04:28.580> this

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
I mean it could be the side like this

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:29.080 
I mean it could be the side like this
time

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090
