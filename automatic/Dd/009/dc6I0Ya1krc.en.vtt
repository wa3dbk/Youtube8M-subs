00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.710 
saw me running grab the Implanon
straight<00:03:38.020> away<00:03:38.230> that<00:03:38.260> is<00:03:38.970> my<00:03:39.970> favorite<00:03:40.150> tactic

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:40.720 
straight away that is my favorite tactic

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.260 
straight away that is my favorite tactic
for<00:03:40.870> this<00:03:41.020> this<00:03:41.410> particular<00:03:42.100> map<00:03:42.550> because<00:03:43.030> the

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:43.270 
for this this particular map because the

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.630 
for this this particular map because the
MPE<00:03:43.600> the<00:03:44.170> empyreans<00:03:44.740> are<00:03:44.860> good<00:03:45.070> you<00:03:45.250> get<00:03:45.400> a

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
MPE the empyreans are good you get a

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.420 
MPE the empyreans are good you get a
decent<00:03:46.060> amount<00:03:46.300> of<00:03:46.510> a<00:03:46.630> momentum<00:03:47.080> and<00:03:47.290> you<00:03:48.250> can

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
decent amount of a momentum and you can

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.760 
decent amount of a momentum and you can
just<00:03:48.580> literally<00:03:48.910> run<00:03:49.720> grab<00:03:50.080> an<00:03:50.170> ACR<00:03:50.500> when

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:50.770 
just literally run grab an ACR when

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.100 
just literally run grab an ACR when
you're<00:03:50.890> out<00:03:51.010> that<00:03:51.190> mo<00:03:51.370> and<00:03:51.730> just<00:03:52.660> keep<00:03:52.840> doing

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
you're out that mo and just keep doing

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.510 
you're out that mo and just keep doing
that<00:03:53.230> rinse<00:03:54.040> and<00:03:54.250> repeat<00:03:55.380> the<00:03:56.380> only<00:03:56.710> thing<00:03:57.370> I

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:57.520 
that rinse and repeat the only thing I

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
enzyme before it's probably going to

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.390

genius

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:21.400 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.790 

and<00:06:21.880> I<00:06:21.940> think<00:06:22.000> on<00:06:22.360> the<00:06:22.449> hardest<00:06:22.810> hardest<00:06:23.290> retro

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:23.800 
and I think on the hardest hardest retro

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.070 
and I think on the hardest hardest retro
missions<00:06:24.270> party<00:06:25.270> such<00:06:25.419> a<00:06:25.449> mission<00:06:25.750> rather

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:26.080 
missions party such a mission rather

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.980 
missions party such a mission rather
that<00:06:26.229> we<00:06:26.290> had<00:06:26.560> so<00:06:26.800> far<00:06:27.040> was<00:06:27.690> what<00:06:28.690> was<00:06:28.810> it<00:06:28.840> I

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:28.990 
that we had so far was what was it I

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.400 
that we had so far was what was it I
think<00:06:29.199> it<00:06:29.350> was<00:06:29.470> very<00:06:29.970> go<00:06:30.970> no<00:06:31.539> no<00:06:31.750> they<00:06:31.900> go<00:06:32.169> it

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:32.410 
think it was very go no no they go it

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:33.689 
think it was very go no no they go it
was<00:06:32.530> the<00:06:32.620> one<00:06:32.740> with<00:06:32.860> the<00:06:32.889> hostages<00:06:33.310> I<00:06:33.490> can't

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:33.699 
was the one with the hostages I can't

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:36.629 
was the one with the hostages I can't
remember<00:06:33.820> the<00:06:34.000> name<00:06:34.180> of<00:06:34.210> it<00:06:34.449> both<00:06:34.690> here<00:06:34.990> and<00:06:35.639> I

remember the name of it both here and I

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:38.939
