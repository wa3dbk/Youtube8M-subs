00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:44.560 
barrel but it worked

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.060

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
so just I'll show you how easy it is

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.680 
so just I'll show you how easy it is
just<00:00:48.370> stick<00:00:48.670> that<00:00:48.700> back<00:00:48.970> down

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
just stick that back down

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.700 
just stick that back down
all<00:00:51.260> right<00:00:51.350> you<00:00:51.829> got<00:00:52.010> your<00:00:52.190> a<00:00:52.219> tree<00:00:52.489> right<00:00:52.760> here

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.300 

your<00:00:56.309> rear<00:00:56.820> sight

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:58.310 
your rear sight

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.530 
your rear sight
which<00:00:58.760> is<00:00:58.940> really<00:00:59.210> accurate

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:00.540 
which is really accurate

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:03.210 
which is really accurate
your<00:01:01.540> extendable<00:01:02.170> blow<00:01:02.380> tube<00:01:02.680> which<00:01:02.950> also

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.220 
your extendable blow tube which also

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.600 
your extendable blow tube which also
acts<00:01:03.550> as<00:01:03.850> a<00:01:04.060> safety<00:01:04.780> device<00:01:05.280> because<00:01:06.280> if<00:01:06.430> it's

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
acts as a safety device because if it's

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.810 
acts as a safety device because if it's
pushed<00:01:06.910> in<00:01:07.120> and<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:08.860> got<00:01:09.040> your<00:01:09.220> reloading

pushed in and you got your reloading

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.060 
pushed in and you got your reloading
mechanism<00:01:09.940> here<00:01:10.510> if<00:01:11.140> it's<00:01:11.320> pushed<00:01:11.560> in<00:01:11.770> and<00:01:11.980> you

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
mechanism here if it's pushed in and you

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.610 
mechanism here if it's pushed in and you
pull<00:01:12.310> back<00:01:12.460> the<00:01:12.670> reloading<00:01:13.300> mechanism<00:01:13.620> you

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:14.620 
pull back the reloading mechanism you

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.950 
pull back the reloading mechanism you
see<00:01:14.830> that's<00:01:15.340> the<00:01:15.580> a<00:01:15.610> blow<00:01:15.850> to<00:01:15.910> hear<00:01:16.300> it<00:01:16.660> blocks

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
here with my rear sight I'm going to go

00:02:51.470 --> 00:03:02.050

back<00:02:51.500> to<00:02:51.680> my<00:02:51.980> door

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:09.880 

all<00:03:02.540> right<00:03:02.750> love<00:03:03.680> it

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:34.710 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.310 

all<00:03:35.220> right<00:03:35.340> now<00:03:36.270> I<00:03:36.510> was<00:03:36.750> know<00:03:36.870> if<00:03:36.960> you<00:03:37.050> can<00:03:37.200> see

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
all right now I was know if you can see

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.100 
all right now I was know if you can see
that<00:03:37.500> clearly<00:03:37.650> but<00:03:38.160> I<00:03:38.340> was<00:03:38.550> aiming<00:03:38.910> here<00:03:39.240> and

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
that clearly but I was aiming here and

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.700 
that clearly but I was aiming here and
it<00:03:40.350> shot<00:03:40.620> up<00:03:40.860> in<00:03:41.130> here<00:03:41.600> so<00:03:42.600> it's<00:03:43.020> really

in<00:04:18.100> engineering<00:04:19.100> I<00:04:19.220> guess<00:04:19.370> you'd<00:04:19.549> call<00:04:19.579> it<00:04:19.789> by

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
in engineering I guess you'd call it by

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.900 
in engineering I guess you'd call it by
the<00:04:20.440> firing<00:04:21.440> mechanism<00:04:21.470> here<00:04:22.220> it's<00:04:22.520> my<00:04:22.699> best

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
the firing mechanism here it's my best

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.110 
the firing mechanism here it's my best
one<00:04:23.150> but<00:04:23.960> by<00:04:24.169> looks<00:04:24.500> what<00:04:25.160> for<00:04:25.430> i<00:04:25.460> have<00:04:25.580> to<00:04:25.880> say

on<00:04:44.660> a<00:04:44.830> pump-action<00:04:45.830> shotgun<00:04:47.289> where<00:04:48.289> you<00:04:49.190> stick

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:50.289 
on a pump-action shotgun where you stick

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:53.959 
on a pump-action shotgun where you stick
like<00:04:51.289> up<00:04:51.470> to<00:04:51.650> 10<00:04:51.860> volts<00:04:52.039> at<00:04:52.340> a<00:04:52.370> time<00:04:52.639> and

00:04:53.959 --> 00:04:53.969 
like up to 10 volts at a time and

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:56.659 
like up to 10 volts at a time and
each<00:04:54.959> time<00:04:55.319> you<00:04:55.499> reload<00:04:55.889> a<00:04:55.919> new<00:04:56.189> bullet<00:04:56.369> a

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:56.669 
each time you reload a new bullet a

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:00.350 
each time you reload a new bullet a
bullet<00:04:56.789> falls<00:04:57.449> in<00:04:57.689> and<00:04:57.899> you<00:04:58.679> shoot<00:04:58.919> it<00:04:59.039> and<00:04:59.360> so

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
bullet falls in and you shoot it and so

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.629 
bullet falls in and you shoot it and so
you<00:05:00.419> don't<00:05:00.479> have<00:05:00.689> to<00:05:00.839> manually<00:05:01.319> reload<00:05:02.039> every

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 
you don't have to manually reload every

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.589 
you don't have to manually reload every
ten<00:05:02.879> bullets<00:05:03.499> so<00:05:04.499> on<00:05:04.709> that's<00:05:05.179> I'm<00:05:06.179> really

00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:06.599 
ten bullets so on that's I'm really

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:07.850 
ten bullets so on that's I'm really
excited<00:05:06.869> to<00:05:07.139> show<00:05:07.289> that<00:05:07.469> to<00:05:07.529> all<00:05:07.739> my
