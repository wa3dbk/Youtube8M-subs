00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.119 
eventually hides for you to find in the
other<00:00:56.699> two<00:00:56.910> games<00:00:57.530> it's<00:00:58.530> got<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.680> picture<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:59.100> a

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
other two games it's got a picture of a

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.240 
other two games it's got a picture of a
nice<00:00:59.340> hoochie<00:00:59.699> on<00:00:59.820> the<00:00:59.940> wall<00:01:00.120> there<00:01:01.010> if<00:01:02.010> you

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
nice hoochie on the wall there if you

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.979 
nice hoochie on the wall there if you
come<00:01:02.430> over<00:01:02.460> here<00:01:02.969> you'll<00:01:03.149> see<00:01:03.210> that<00:01:03.539> this<00:01:03.719> wall

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
come over here you'll see that this wall

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.700 
come over here you'll see that this wall
is<00:01:04.290> breakable<00:01:04.949> it's<00:01:05.790> got<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.710> Enigma

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
is breakable it's got the Enigma

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.770 
is breakable it's got the Enigma
question<00:01:08.130> mark<00:01:08.340> on<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:08.880> he<00:01:09.510> breaks

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
question mark on it and he breaks

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.690 
question mark on it and he breaks
through<00:01:09.990> it<00:01:10.110> much<00:01:10.290> in<00:01:10.439> his<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:11.040> same<00:01:11.250> way<00:01:11.490> he

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
through it much in his the same way he

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.060 
through it much in his the same way he
breaks<00:01:11.970> into<00:01:12.210> his<00:01:12.600> hideouts<00:01:13.049> in<00:01:13.320> Arkham<00:01:13.799> City

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
breaks into his hideouts in Arkham City

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.039 
breaks into his hideouts in Arkham City
and<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:14.790> I<00:01:14.820> think<00:01:15.000> that's<00:01:15.240> pretty<00:01:15.509> cool<00:01:15.750> there

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
and so I think that's pretty cool there

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.770 
and so I think that's pretty cool there
and<00:01:16.290> you'll<00:01:16.979> also<00:01:17.220> see<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.640> in<00:01:17.970> here<00:01:18.390> there

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
and you'll also see that in here there

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.690 
and you'll also see that in here there
is<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.580> Riddler<00:01:20.580> trophy<00:01:21.060> now<00:01:22.020> this<00:01:22.590> is<00:01:22.860> when

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
is a Riddler trophy now this is when

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.609 
is a Riddler trophy now this is when
when<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.060> pick<00:01:24.330> this<00:01:24.479> up<00:01:24.689> it<00:01:24.900> activated<00:01:25.380> an

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
when I pick this up it activated an

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.890 
when I pick this up it activated an
achievement<00:01:25.979> for<00:01:26.189> me<00:01:26.490> on<00:01:26.610> Steam<00:01:27.000> so<00:01:27.659> I'd

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
achievement for me on Steam so I'd

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.440 
achievement for me on Steam so I'd
assume<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:28.619> there<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.700> an<00:01:29.820> achievement<00:01:29.939> for

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
assume that there is an achievement for

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.469 
assume that there is an achievement for
that<00:01:30.600> on<00:01:30.780> Xbox<00:01:31.229> 360<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:32.159> PlayStation<00:01:33.000> 3<00:01:33.030> as

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
that on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 as

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.120 
that on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 as
well<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:34.470> can<00:01:34.560> see<00:01:34.710> has<00:01:34.860> some<00:01:35.009> more

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
well you can see has some more

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.249 
well you can see has some more
blueprints<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:35.880> prototype<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:37.140> know

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
blueprints and prototype you know

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.380 
blueprints and prototype you know
devices<00:01:37.799> in<00:01:37.979> here<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:38.700> little<00:01:38.970> bear<00:01:39.119> trap

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
devices in here that little bear trap

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.539 
devices in here that little bear trap
looking<00:01:39.720> thing<00:01:39.950> holds<00:01:40.950> plenty<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.430> the

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
looking thing holds plenty of the

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.670 
looking thing holds plenty of the
Riddler<00:01:41.850> trophies<00:01:42.299> in<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.600> other<00:01:42.990> in<00:01:43.320> the

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
Riddler trophies in the other in the

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.440 
Riddler trophies in the other in the
other<00:01:43.710> games<00:01:44.130> so<00:01:44.610> that's<00:01:44.790> pretty<00:01:45.000> cool<00:01:45.210> there

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
other games so that's pretty cool there

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.420 
other games so that's pretty cool there
and<00:01:47.119> also<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.360> should<00:01:48.420> note<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:49.170> one<00:01:49.799> once<00:01:50.280> you

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
and also I should note that one once you
