look at it right you can you can look
around<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:32.850> everything<00:00:33.210> physics<00:00:33.719> exists<00:00:34.050> in

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
around and everything physics exists in

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.139 
around and everything physics exists in
real<00:00:34.320> time<00:00:34.530> over<00:00:34.559> there<00:00:35.010> it's<00:00:35.670> done<00:00:35.969> by

anyway right
come<00:01:40.380> on<00:01:40.500> spawn<00:01:40.799> in<00:01:41.060> there<00:01:42.060> we<00:01:42.150> go<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:42.630> spawned

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
come on spawn in there we go I spawned

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.990 
come on spawn in there we go I spawned
too<00:01:43.350> many<00:01:43.530> there<00:01:43.710> we<00:01:43.770> go<00:01:43.890> look<00:01:44.549> alright<00:01:44.790> in

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
too many there we go look alright in

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.350 
too many there we go look alright in
this<00:01:45.180> one<00:01:45.450> you<00:01:46.200> actually<00:01:46.229> are<00:01:46.740> going<00:01:47.070> in<00:01:47.729> 2009

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
this one you actually are going in 2009

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.480 
this one you actually are going in 2009
she<00:01:48.509> open<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.780> doors<00:01:49.020> where's<00:01:50.009> this<00:01:50.159> one<00:01:50.340> you

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
she open the doors where's this one you

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.819 
she open the doors where's this one you
can<00:01:50.610> just<00:01:50.640> walk<00:01:50.909> in<00:01:51.090> it's<00:01:51.360> beautiful<00:01:51.780> like<00:01:52.560> if

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
can just walk in it's beautiful like if

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.730 
can just walk in it's beautiful like if
we<00:01:52.950> just<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.880> is<00:01:54.540> done<00:01:54.750> by<00:01:54.930> portal<00:01:55.320> so<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:55.590> means

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
we just it is done by portal so it means

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.109 
we just it is done by portal so it means
it<00:01:55.890> is<00:01:56.009> quite<00:01:56.280> performance<00:01:56.700> heavy<00:01:56.880> if<00:01:57.060> you

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
it is quite performance heavy if you

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.969 
it is quite performance heavy if you
don't<00:01:57.270> go<00:01:57.360> very<00:01:57.570> good<00:01:57.600> buta<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.560> will<00:01:58.710> notice

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.819 
amazing if we just um I don't know if it
will<00:02:04.710> work<00:02:04.950> like<00:02:04.979> this<00:02:06.500> we<00:02:07.500> put<00:02:07.680> something

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
will work like this we put something

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.010 
will work like this we put something
there

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
there

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.580 
there
and<00:02:10.660> now<00:02:11.660> we<00:02:11.720> have<00:02:11.840> to<00:02:11.930> actually<00:02:12.200> be<00:02:12.290> in<00:02:12.350> it<00:02:12.470> but

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
and now we have to actually be in it but

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.890 
and now we have to actually be in it but
if<00:02:12.650> we<00:02:12.740> just<00:02:12.770> go<00:02:12.980> like<00:02:13.250> that<00:02:13.720> physics<00:02:14.720> are

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
if we just go like that physics are

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:21.280 
if we just go like that physics are
existing<00:02:15.500> in<00:02:15.620> real<00:02:15.830> time<00:02:16.070> like<00:02:16.310> you<00:02:16.700> can<00:02:20.290> like

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
existing in real time like you can like

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.880 
existing in real time like you can like
that<00:02:21.680> and<00:02:22.150> see<00:02:23.150> like<00:02:23.450> oh<00:02:26.080> I<00:02:27.080> need<00:02:27.440> to<00:02:27.650> get<00:02:27.770> in

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
that and see like oh I need to get in

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.630 
that and see like oh I need to get in
their<00:02:27.980> way<00:02:28.010> position<00:02:30.310> that's<00:02:31.310> just<00:02:31.460> getting

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
their way position that's just getting

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.230 
their way position that's just getting
you<00:02:31.730> one<00:02:32.890> run<00:02:33.890> out<00:02:34.070> that's<00:02:34.670> kind<00:02:35.000> of<00:02:35.060> that's

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
you one run out that's kind of that's

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.210 
you one run out that's kind of that's
existing<00:02:35.780> in<00:02:35.960> real<00:02:36.230> time<00:02:36.440> everything<00:02:37.010> in<00:02:37.130> the

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
existing in real time everything in the

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.900 
existing in real time everything in the
star<00:02:37.430> list<00:02:37.640> is<00:02:38.000> pretty<00:02:39.340> well<00:02:40.340> made<00:02:40.370> it's

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
star list is pretty well made it's

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.390 
star list is pretty well made it's
amazing<00:02:41.540> isn't<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.500> real<00:02:42.740> one<00:02:42.980> the<00:02:43.100> real<00:02:43.250> one

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
amazing isn't the real one the real one

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:47.240 
is terrible but look it's a real TARDIS

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.210 
is terrible but look it's a real TARDIS
is<00:02:47.390> fantastic<00:02:48.290> I'll<00:02:48.710> leave<00:02:48.860> a<00:02:48.890> link<00:02:49.040> at<00:02:49.130> the
