spawn<00:02:00.719> ten<00:02:01.140> pound<00:02:01.439> sign<00:02:01.770> so<00:02:02.369> SVS<00:02:03.210> add<00:02:03.479> slash

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
spawn ten pound sign so SVS add slash

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.160 
spawn ten pound sign so SVS add slash
born<00:02:05.060> so<00:02:06.060> now<00:02:06.210> this<00:02:06.390> sign<00:02:06.630> will<00:02:06.810> go<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:06.960> the

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
born so now this sign will go to the

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.070 
born so now this sign will go to the
spawn<00:02:07.469> same<00:02:08.340> as<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.640> other<00:02:08.759> one<00:02:08.910> but<00:02:09.810> then<00:02:09.959> I

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
spawn same as the other one but then I

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.690 
spawn same as the other one but then I
could<00:02:10.259> also<00:02:10.289> add<00:02:10.619> a<00:02:10.649> cost<00:02:11.009> for<00:02:11.280> using<00:02:11.610> the

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
could also add a cost for using the

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.060 
could also add a cost for using the
command

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.260 

so<00:02:18.070> tie<00:02:18.340> the<00:02:18.400> cost<00:02:18.760> you<00:02:19.000> do<00:02:19.150> slash<00:02:19.710> SVS<00:02:21.270> set

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
so tie the cost you do slash SVS set

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.350 
so tie the cost you do slash SVS set
price<00:02:22.570> and<00:02:22.930> then<00:02:23.380> the<00:02:23.470> price<00:02:24.090> see<00:02:25.090> you<00:02:25.150> right

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
price and then the price see you right

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:33.120 
price and then the price see you right
click<00:02:25.570> so<00:02:26.080> now<00:02:26.200> this<00:02:26.380> spawn<00:02:26.680> sign<00:02:26.980> cost<00:02:27.310> $10<00:02:32.130> so

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
click so now this spawn sign cost $10 so

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.730 
click so now this spawn sign cost $10 so
the<00:02:33.250> price<00:02:33.490> has<00:02:33.700> been<00:02:33.730> added<00:02:34.180> successfully

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
the price has been added successfully

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:41.460 
the price has been added successfully
then<00:02:35.740> SVS<00:02:38.340> confirmation<00:02:39.340> true<00:02:40.260> this<00:02:41.260> means

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
then SVS confirmation true this means

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.050 
then SVS confirmation true this means
that<00:02:41.710> when<00:02:41.860> you<00:02:41.950> right-click<00:02:42.160> on<00:02:42.490> the<00:02:42.610> sign<00:02:42.850> it

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
that when you right-click on the sign it

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.240 
that when you right-click on the sign it
will<00:02:43.150> actually<00:02:43.480> get<00:02:43.630> you<00:02:43.750> to<00:02:43.780> say<00:02:44.110> s<00:02:44.380> vs<00:02:44.710> yes<00:02:44.980> or

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
will actually get you to say s vs yes or

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.160 
will actually get you to say s vs yes or
click<00:02:46.030> again<00:02:46.270> to<00:02:46.330> cancel<00:02:46.900> it

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
click again to cancel it

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.830 
click again to cancel it
so<00:02:48.010> Ashley<00:02:48.190> asks<00:02:48.910> you<00:02:49.030> before<00:02:49.390> you<00:02:49.480> use<00:02:49.630> the

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
so Ashley asks you before you use the

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.170 
so Ashley asks you before you use the
sign<00:02:50.050> if<00:02:50.230> you<00:02:50.350> want<00:02:50.530> to<00:02:50.770> so<00:02:51.700> I<00:02:51.760> think<00:02:51.820> this<00:02:52.060> is

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
sign if you want to so I think this is

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.080 
sign if you want to so I think this is
quite<00:02:52.330> a<00:02:52.420> useful<00:02:52.570> feature<00:02:53.020> as<00:02:53.290> well<00:02:53.470> to<00:02:53.680> add

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
quite a useful feature as well to add

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.820 
quite a useful feature as well to add
it's<00:02:55.090> obviously<00:02:55.420> the<00:02:55.600> Builder<00:02:55.990> sign<00:02:56.230> will

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:56.830 
it's obviously the Builder sign will

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.680 
it's obviously the Builder sign will
just<00:02:57.160> cover<00:02:57.340> that<00:02:57.460> again<00:02:57.670> you<00:02:58.390> can<00:02:58.540> actually

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
just cover that again you can actually

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:06.470 
just cover that again you can actually
add<00:02:59.020> groups<00:02:59.440> you<00:02:59.890> do<00:03:00.040> SVS<00:03:02.850> set<00:03:03.850> permissions

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.090 

and<00:03:07.480> then<00:03:07.570> whatever<00:03:07.810> permission<00:03:08.410> you<00:03:08.500> want<00:03:08.650> so

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
and then whatever permission you want so

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.860 
and then whatever permission you want so
for<00:03:09.340> this<00:03:09.430> example<00:03:09.610> I'd<00:03:10.030> use<00:03:10.240> builder<00:03:10.660> and

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
for this example I'd use builder and

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.440 
for this example I'd use builder and
then<00:03:11.860> it<00:03:11.980> basically<00:03:12.340> creates<00:03:12.640> a<00:03:13.120> permission

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
then it basically creates a permission

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.570 
then it basically creates a permission
note<00:03:13.780> to<00:03:14.140> use<00:03:14.290> this<00:03:14.530> one<00:03:14.860> sign<00:03:17.250> so<00:03:18.250> you<00:03:18.310> can

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
note to use this one sign so you can

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.550 
note to use this one sign so you can
obviously<00:03:18.790> use<00:03:18.940> it<00:03:19.090> again<00:03:19.450> and<00:03:19.600> again<00:03:19.840> but<00:03:20.260> the

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
obviously use it again and again but the

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.800 
obviously use it again and again but the
basic<00:03:21.400> node<00:03:21.610> for<00:03:21.880> this<00:03:21.970> would<00:03:22.270> be<00:03:22.300> server

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
basic node for this would be server

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.700 
basic node for this would be server
signs<00:03:23.610> dot<00:03:24.610> use<00:03:24.910> and<00:03:25.240> then<00:03:26.110> dot<00:03:26.410> whatever

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:26.710 
signs dot use and then dot whatever

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.280 
signs dot use and then dot whatever
you've<00:03:27.160> created<00:03:27.490> so<00:03:28.060> dock<00:03:28.330> builder<00:03:28.750> and<00:03:29.170> you

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
you've created so dock builder and you

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.870 
you've created so dock builder and you
just<00:03:29.470> put<00:03:29.680> that<00:03:29.710> in<00:03:29.860> your<00:03:30.040> builder<00:03:30.340> group<00:03:30.520> file

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
just put that in your builder group file

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.490 
just put that in your builder group file
and<00:03:31.180> that<00:03:31.390> works<00:03:31.660> fine<00:03:31.960> they<00:03:32.200> could<00:03:32.350> all<00:03:32.470> use

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
and that works fine they could all use

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.230 
and that works fine they could all use
this<00:03:32.830> sign<00:03:33.130> but<00:03:33.430> other<00:03:33.550> groups<00:03:33.850> couldn't

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:34.240 
this sign but other groups couldn't

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.670 
this sign but other groups couldn't
unless<00:03:34.510> they've<00:03:34.720> got<00:03:34.750> the<00:03:34.990> permission<00:03:37.680> so

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
unless they've got the permission so

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.950 
unless they've got the permission so
then<00:03:38.830> finally<00:03:39.040> you<00:03:39.430> can<00:03:39.580> also<00:03:39.730> add<00:03:40.030> a<00:03:40.240> group

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:40.960 
then finally you can also add a group

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:42.870 
then finally you can also add a group
one<00:03:41.290> so<00:03:41.740> you<00:03:41.800> can<00:03:41.920> have<00:03:41.980> a<00:03:42.100> group<00:03:42.280> cool<00:03:42.610> down

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
one so you can have a group cool down

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.150 
one so you can have a group cool down
this<00:03:43.780> means<00:03:44.020> the<00:03:44.200> sign<00:03:44.410> can<00:03:44.650> only<00:03:44.770> be<00:03:44.950> used

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
this means the sign can only be used

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.490 
this means the sign can only be used
once<00:03:45.459> in<00:03:45.670> this<00:03:45.850> time<00:03:46.090> by<00:03:46.300> anyone<00:03:46.810> obviously

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
once in this time by anyone obviously

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.290 
once in this time by anyone obviously
the<00:03:47.620> previous<00:03:48.040> cool<00:03:48.280> down<00:03:48.490> was<00:03:48.640> per<00:03:48.820> player

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
the previous cool down was per player

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.770 
the previous cool down was per player
this<00:03:50.140> one<00:03:50.350> is<00:03:50.500> per<00:03:50.800> sign<00:03:51.610> as<00:03:51.880> such<00:03:52.150> so<00:03:52.510> any

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
this one is per sign as such so any

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.300 
this one is per sign as such so any
player<00:03:53.080> that<00:03:53.200> clicks<00:03:53.470> on<00:03:53.620> it<00:03:53.680> can<00:03:54.010> only<00:03:54.160> be

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
player that clicks on it can only be

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.130 
player that clicks on it can only be
used<00:03:54.520> once<00:03:54.640> so<00:03:55.180> you<00:03:55.209> could<00:03:55.390> do<00:03:55.480> a<00:03:55.510> hidden<00:03:55.840> sign

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
used once so you could do a hidden sign

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.870 
used once so you could do a hidden sign
that<00:03:56.410> can<00:03:56.530> only<00:03:56.650> be<00:03:56.740> used<00:03:56.830> once<00:03:57.250> an<00:03:57.459> hour<00:03:57.580> or

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:57.880 
that can only be used once an hour or

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.449 
that can only be used once an hour or
something<00:03:58.000> like<00:03:58.270> that<00:03:58.420> I<00:03:59.190> really<00:04:00.190> love<00:04:00.340> this

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
something like that I really love this

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:02.010 
something like that I really love this
plug-in<00:04:00.880> it<00:04:01.000> will<00:04:01.090> be<00:04:01.180> going<00:04:01.360> straight<00:04:01.750> on<00:04:01.870> my
