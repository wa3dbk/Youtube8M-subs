00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:16.630
 hello people while here today day 2b 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.850
 this is a vision muscle training and 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.350
 I want to show if the exercises are okay 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.570
 the exercises for the second day of training 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:25.070
 you see, not many, but they are 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.419
 Exercises have it all and how 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.210
 requires the squats 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:30.880
 that's one of the best exercises or the 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.530
 best exercise for with the biggest 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.230
 Growth potential becomes the whole body 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.330
 with mainly seven trained 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:42.320
 Exercises, of course, for the thighs 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:43.790
 for the buttocks creatures like 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.280
 he already said one actually 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.010
 quite a movement behind the back 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.380
 will also suppress strong front 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.880
 as well because community whole 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.610
 kerner so also the belly if 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.070
 the one who keeps strained yes that would 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:01.420
 I also recommend 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.420
 as I said in March almost in the whole body 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.340
 we make four sets of it and then 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.829
 it goes to the cross so the two fixed 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.929
 Exercise for the entire body so 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:24.090
 here is the back trained the 

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:26.719
 calves also the legs of the two 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.590
 biceps everything helps with the tidy 

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:30.450
 So pay attention to a shoulder here 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.459
 Walken stood and initially only under 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.649
 use of the leg muscles the rod 

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:37.289
 pull up to knee level and then 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.750
 stretches her back through yes quietly 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:41.670
 in the hollow cross look up so for 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.939
 make this beautiful 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.380
 breast out shoulder to the back and the 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.739
 rod down again close to the body down 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.739
 to lead 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.030
 and we make three sets of it too 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.400
 here eight to twelve repetitions then 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:07.470
 is it to prevent rowing that we 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:10.210
 make classic theme rowing and 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.130
 Great book one parallel to the ground 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:15.070
 to give with the upper body another 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.570
 recommended as angle listen to choose 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.400
 So the upper body a bit walter 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.980
 Just sit up and try something out 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.050
 for you the best contacts in the back 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.650
 is too beautiful from the out of the 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.810
 rhythm ckl stretches out his arms 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.760
 high it still sets with three and then 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.430
 maybe also of the month at the end 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.820
 yes pull up to the chin 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.590
 we prefer to use the sz bar here 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.660
 just around the wrists bit too 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.160
 save 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.500
 it's not that painful often with 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.970
 the middle 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.970
 straight barbell for example 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.959
 and we make two sets of it and then 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.159
