so<00:00:02.429> here<00:00:02.580> we<00:00:02.700> are<00:00:02.820> and<00:00:03.120> a<00:00:03.449> slightly<00:00:04.170> better

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
so here we are and a slightly better

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.160 
so here we are and a slightly better
orientation<00:00:04.850> to<00:00:05.850> see<00:00:06.359> this<00:00:06.569> you<00:00:06.779> can<00:00:06.899> see<00:00:07.049> the

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
orientation to see this you can see the

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.020 
orientation to see this you can see the
web<00:00:07.319> page<00:00:07.589> you<00:00:07.770> can<00:00:07.859> see<00:00:08.069> the<00:00:08.189> trackpad<00:00:08.760> a

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
web page you can see the trackpad a

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.089 
web page you can see the trackpad a
little<00:00:09.420> bit<00:00:09.599> scrolling<00:00:10.559> is<00:00:10.590> obviously<00:00:11.010> a

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
little bit scrolling is obviously a

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.450 
little bit scrolling is obviously a
two-finger<00:00:12.059> swipe<00:00:12.769> gesture<00:00:13.769> on<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.070> tripod

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
two-finger swipe gesture on a tripod

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.820 
two-finger swipe gesture on a tripod
we're<00:00:14.910> all<00:00:15.030> fairly<00:00:15.330> used<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:16.020> that<00:00:16.230> I<00:00:16.379> think

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
we're all fairly used to that I think

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.820 
we're all fairly used to that I think
and<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.970> inertia<00:00:18.390> works<00:00:19.080> just<00:00:19.470> like<00:00:19.650> you'd

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
and the inertia works just like you'd

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.480 
and the inertia works just like you'd
expect<00:00:21.410> if<00:00:22.410> I<00:00:22.560> sweep<00:00:22.920> at<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.100> right<00:00:23.279> way<00:00:23.460> of

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
expect if I sweep at the right way of

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.500 
expect if I sweep at the right way of
course<00:00:25.039> you<00:00:26.039> really<00:00:26.250> do<00:00:26.369> get<00:00:26.550> really<00:00:26.910> rapid

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
course you really do get really rapid

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.870 
course you really do get really rapid
movement<00:00:27.930> this<00:00:28.470> is<00:00:28.619> our<00:00:28.800> really<00:00:29.369> long<00:00:29.609> web

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880

movement this is our really long web
page<00:00:30.150> I<00:00:30.330> can<00:00:30.390> maybe<00:00:30.599> show<00:00:30.810> you<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:31.080> scroll

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
page I can maybe show you the scroll

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.940 
page I can maybe show you the scroll
thumb<00:00:31.890> which<00:00:32.189> you<00:00:32.340> can<00:00:32.520> just<00:00:32.940> about<00:00:33.329> see<00:00:33.390> there

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.950 
thumb which you can just about see there

thumb which you can just about see there
you<00:00:34.950> really<00:00:35.100> do<00:00:35.309> get<00:00:35.460> very<00:00:35.520> rapid<00:00:36.120> movement

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
you really do get very rapid movement

when it's moving you can just sort of
tap<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.690> catch<00:00:42.960> it<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.610> stop<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:44.820> whatever<00:00:45.809> you

for the trackpad if you prefer to go

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.410 
for the trackpad if you prefer to go
even<00:01:05.760> faster<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.869> can<00:01:06.900> definitely<00:01:07.530> do<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:07.740> I

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:08.420 
even faster you can definitely do that I

even faster you can definitely do that I

and<00:01:17.580> that's<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.820> surprising<00:01:18.330> thing<00:01:18.479> I<00:01:18.570> was

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
and that's a surprising thing I was

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.980 
and that's a surprising thing I was
expecting<00:01:18.990> strong<00:01:19.500> but<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:20.009> be<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.280> main

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
expecting strong but to be the main

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.140 
expecting strong but to be the main
painful<00:01:21.990> part<00:01:22.259> of<00:01:22.439> using<00:01:22.830> a<00:01:22.950> desktop<00:01:23.400> trackpad

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
painful part of using a desktop trackpad

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.210 
painful part of using a desktop trackpad
so<00:01:24.930> let's<00:01:25.110> talk<00:01:25.229> about<00:01:25.290> text<00:01:25.770> selection<00:01:26.040> I'm

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
so let's talk about text selection I'm

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.480 
so let's talk about text selection I'm
just<00:01:26.340> going<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.490> sort<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.729> zoom<00:01:26.939> in<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.090> wee<00:01:27.420> bit

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
just going to sort a zoom in a wee bit

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.310 
just going to sort a zoom in a wee bit
so<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.579> can<00:01:29.640> see<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:30.090> text<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.600> bit<00:01:30.630> more<00:01:30.960> the

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
so you can see the text a bit more the

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.080 
so you can see the text a bit more the
problem<00:01:31.799> with<00:01:31.920> text<00:01:32.250> selection<00:01:32.490> or<00:01:32.759> trackpad

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
problem with text selection or trackpad

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.170 
problem with text selection or trackpad
for<00:01:33.570> me<00:01:33.689> is<00:01:33.810> that<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:34.409> either<00:01:34.680> had<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.180> use

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
for me is that you either had to use

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.890 
for me is that you either had to use
that<00:01:36.570> sort<00:01:37.500> of<00:01:37.590> double<00:01:38.280> tap<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:39.000> click<00:01:39.390> and

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
that sort of double tap to click and

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.069 
that sort of double tap to click and
drag<00:01:40.200> option<00:01:40.950> which<00:01:41.729> is<00:01:41.970> it's<00:01:42.570> okay<00:01:42.899> if<00:01:42.990> you're

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
drag option which is it's okay if you're

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.450 
drag option which is it's okay if you're
doing<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.439> deliberately<00:01:43.829> but<00:01:44.159> you<00:01:44.220> end<00:01:44.340> up

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
say this user interface convention I'm

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.309 
say this user interface convention I'm
just<00:02:39.849> moving<00:02:39.970> the<00:02:40.209> pointer<00:02:40.390> as<00:02:40.810> I<00:02:41.260> normally

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
just moving the pointer as I normally

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.100 
just moving the pointer as I normally
would<00:02:41.739> as<00:02:42.129> with<00:02:42.790> one<00:02:43.000> finger<00:02:43.299> but<00:02:43.659> if<00:02:43.750> i<00:02:43.840> switch

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
would as with one finger but if i switch

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.520 
would as with one finger but if i switch
to<00:02:44.140> three<00:02:44.560> fingers<00:02:45.040> and<00:02:45.220> drag<00:02:46.090> across<00:02:46.120> i<00:02:46.840> can

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
to three fingers and drag across i can

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.800 
to three fingers and drag across i can
select<00:02:48.459> that<00:02:48.670> text<00:02:49.030> and<00:02:49.299> it's<00:02:49.690> actually

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
select that text and it's actually

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.360 
select that text and it's actually
really<00:02:50.170> precise<00:02:50.680> and<00:02:51.010> really<00:02:51.310> easy<00:02:52.140> I<00:02:53.370> there's

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
really precise and really easy I there's

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.069 
really precise and really easy I there's
another<00:02:54.579> option<00:02:54.819> for<00:02:55.090> what<00:02:55.390> three<00:02:55.629> fingers<00:02:55.989> do

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.079 
another option for what three fingers do

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:57.869 
another option for what three fingers do
I<00:02:56.140> think<00:02:56.230> it's<00:02:56.500> the<00:02:56.530> swipe<00:02:56.950> left<00:02:57.280> and<00:02:57.489> right<00:02:57.700> to

00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:57.879 
I think it's the swipe left and right to

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:00.270 
I think it's the swipe left and right to
trigger<00:02:58.260> moving<00:02:59.260> between<00:02:59.379> photos<00:03:00.010> in<00:03:00.190> iphoto

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
trigger moving between photos in iphoto

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.819 
trigger moving between photos in iphoto
which<00:03:00.970> I<00:03:01.090> really<00:03:01.299> never<00:03:01.420> use<00:03:01.810> or<00:03:02.170> back<00:03:02.440> and

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
which I really never use or back and

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:06.180 
which I really never use or back and
forward<00:03:03.340> and<00:03:03.489> Safari<00:03:03.940> which<00:03:04.390> I<00:03:04.659> I<00:03:05.049> never<00:03:05.319> used

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
forward and Safari which I I never used

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.190 
forward and Safari which I I never used
because<00:03:06.489> I<00:03:06.670> use<00:03:07.209> the<00:03:07.329> keyboard<00:03:07.750> for<00:03:08.019> that<00:03:08.170> I

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
because I use the keyboard for that I

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.619 
because I use the keyboard for that I
use<00:03:08.440> keyboard<00:03:09.069> shortcuts<00:03:09.129> extensively<00:03:10.000> but

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:10.629 
use keyboard shortcuts extensively but

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:12.479 
use keyboard shortcuts extensively but
less<00:03:10.870> ability<00:03:11.140> to<00:03:11.500> use<00:03:11.650> three<00:03:11.950> fingers<00:03:11.980> to

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
less ability to use three fingers to
