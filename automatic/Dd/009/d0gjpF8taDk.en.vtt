00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.170
 to make this period work we need projects 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:32.829
 we just click 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.010
 m 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.790
 m 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.450
 however the mode 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.450
 on the fuel cell 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.230
 as soon as the hydrogen is in contact with the membrane 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.450
 the engine starts to spin 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.450
 electricity produced 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.820
 oxygen use the oxygen data 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.670
 let's eliminate the arrival of the next 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.830
 very quickly the engine stops 

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:28.099
 thank you 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:31.939
 this fuel cell use project the subject 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.989
 we just have the flow is too young 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.910
 at the wide choice of fuel cells covers eight meters from the power plant 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:53.909
 to follow 

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:13.059
 connect the project inlet pipe 

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:17.399
 as soon as the hydrogen is in contact with the membrane, we notice the presence 

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:20.399
 a tension 

00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:31.619
 by making a bypass to the motor circuit 

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:33.749
 this one starts spinning 

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:35.949
 electricity is produced 

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:38.949
 oxygen is used it's oxygen from the air 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:54.339
 right here
