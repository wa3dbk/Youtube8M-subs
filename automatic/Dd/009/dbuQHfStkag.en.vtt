00:00:00.839 --> 00:00:03.350
 Hello everyone, everything good 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.350
 today we will talk about a legend about parents 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:11.460
 this legend told in several ways is one of them 

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:18.549
 Once upon a time I did not understand that I lived in India. 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.419
 and his subordinates did not even indicate that he should be with the target 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:26.369
 to run from the water what I had fun 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.680
 he then proposed a reward to anyone who could get him back 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:32.630
 smile 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.650
 was when it came from the used river that presented to the king the game of chess 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.460
 after spending only joy for the invention 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.100
 the king said 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.210
 for saturday 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.260
 what 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.150
 Ask for susfor and make up 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.480
 do not know then ask as prizes 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.040
 rice grain 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.530
 the king quite surprised by the simplicity of the request asked 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.530
 immediately with the desired amount 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.750
 the sage leaving 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.280
 the even more frightened integrated king asked the sovereign to put in the 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.330
 tray a grain of rice in the first house 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.770
 two grain of rice on the second 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.690
 four in the third eight in the fourth in the fifth and so on 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.780
 always doubling the name of grains 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:21.830
 already bad 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.350
 at each pass 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.190
 of each case 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.540
 the king is perplexed and does not understand the limitation of the request 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.650
 it was worth it to pay better quantum amount 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.979
 Well, what I can show you is that you use that legend. 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.979
 we can introduce the concept of police equations 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.440
 how many tons of soda in total 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.440
 Image 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.010
 two high 0 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.140
 is the same as representing the first house chessboard 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.900
 2 to 1 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.530
 business to 2 representing the second house of the chessboard 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.460
 and so 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.420
 consequence 2 is squared and 4 represents the third 

00:02:11.179 --> 00:02:12.539
 2 high 

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:15.539
 to 3 

00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:23.419
 Good, and see how you stayed for your house. 

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:28.999
 two high 10 is equal to me 24 representing the tenth house we must 

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:32.509
 Also remember that after you have made the tip for each house 

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:37.299
 we must add as per one all cases to arrive at the desired amount in the 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:38.529
 Saturday 

00:02:38.529 --> 00:02:42.109
 this represents an astronomical number maxine 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:45.709
 with 1 thousand grains already royce weighs approximately 25 grams 

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:49.069
 the king would have to arrange 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.179
 461 billion tons of rice 

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:53.759
 clement is not 

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:57.759
 world currently produces around 400 million 

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:58.809
 tons 

00:02:58.809 --> 00:03:01.240
 that it would take a thousand years 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.340
 the current production of the whole world 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.340
 to erase the king from time to time 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:12.879
 good staff hope you have enjoyed beyond the chess with the cleverness of the wise 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:16.700
 and in using math to assist you in your day to day life. 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.719
 See you at the next meeting.
