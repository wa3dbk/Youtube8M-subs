purely aesthetic and so you don't need
to<00:01:45.960> worry<00:01:46.200> about<00:01:46.320> which<00:01:46.860> one<00:01:47.130> will<00:01:47.369> work

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
to worry about which one will work

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.450 
to worry about which one will work
better<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.780> outlet<00:01:49.320> pipe<00:01:49.619> will<00:01:49.920> return<00:01:50.280> the

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
better the outlet pipe will return the

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
will return water from the filter and

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.899 
will return water from the filter and
