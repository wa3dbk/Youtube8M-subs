00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.570 
the third part is a silicon gel there's
a<00:03:24.990> lot<00:03:25.230> going<00:03:25.500> on<00:03:25.590> with<00:03:25.650> this<00:03:25.860> case<00:03:26.100> but<00:03:26.430> just

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
a lot going on with this case but just

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.550 
a lot going on with this case but just
like<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:26.850> previous<00:03:27.209> case<00:03:27.450> the<00:03:27.480> cuts<00:03:27.959> are<00:03:28.230> in<00:03:28.470> a

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
like the previous case the cuts are in a

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.650 
like the previous case the cuts are in a
correct<00:03:28.830> location<00:03:29.430> but<00:03:29.910> they're<00:03:30.090> just<00:03:30.209> a<00:03:30.360> tad

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
correct location but they're just a tad

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.360 
correct location but they're just a tad
large<00:03:31.050> and<00:03:31.320> this<00:03:31.410> does<00:03:31.650> affect<00:03:31.830> the<00:03:32.130> way<00:03:32.250> the

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
large and this does affect the way the

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.520 
large and this does affect the way the
case<00:03:32.550> looks<00:03:32.910> also<00:03:33.600> there's<00:03:33.990> a<00:03:34.050> cutout<00:03:34.290> for<00:03:34.470> the

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
case looks also there's a cutout for the

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.350 
case looks also there's a cutout for the
kickstand<00:03:35.040> that<00:03:35.100> allows<00:03:35.430> you<00:03:35.580> to<00:03:35.670> such<00:03:35.910> device

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
accurate size when the case is closed it

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.750 
accurate size when the case is closed it
has<00:04:46.169> a<00:04:46.200> part<00:04:46.560> that<00:04:46.590> sort<00:04:46.919> of<00:04:47.040> juts<00:04:47.280> out<00:04:47.490> and
