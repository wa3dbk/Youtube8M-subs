they<00:03:29.440> don't<00:03:29.680> realize<00:03:29.739> is<00:03:30.100> that<00:03:30.519> it's<00:03:30.730> a<00:03:30.880> very

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
they don't realize is that it's a very

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:43.489 
they don't realize is that it's a very
technique<00:03:31.840> sensitive<00:03:32.769> skill

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:43.499 

00:03:43.499 --> 00:03:46.440 

way<00:03:44.499> of<00:03:44.829> brushing<00:03:45.040> your<00:03:45.340> teeth<00:03:45.579> doesn't<00:03:46.030> work

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
way of brushing your teeth doesn't work

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.940 
way of brushing your teeth doesn't work
for<00:03:46.840> everyone<00:03:47.730> so<00:03:48.730> we<00:03:49.120> all<00:03:49.749> need<00:03:50.319> to<00:03:50.799> be

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
for everyone so we all need to be

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.940 
for everyone so we all need to be
coached<00:03:51.310> on<00:03:51.810> what<00:03:52.810> is<00:03:52.959> the<00:03:53.109> best<00:03:53.319> way<00:03:53.560> that<00:03:53.590> I

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
coached on what is the best way that I

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.000 
coached on what is the best way that I
need<00:03:54.099> to<00:03:54.519> do<00:03:54.670> that<00:03:54.879> for<00:03:55.239> my<00:03:55.450> mouth<00:03:55.719> and<00:03:56.109> that's

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
need to do that for my mouth and that's

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.940 
need to do that for my mouth and that's
very<00:03:57.519> simple<00:03:58.180> isn't<00:03:58.420> it<00:03:58.659> it<00:03:59.409> is<00:03:59.469> it's<00:03:59.889> very

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
very simple isn't it it is it's very

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.929 
very simple isn't it it is it's very
simple<00:04:00.489> and<00:04:00.819> then<00:04:01.269> of<00:04:01.419> course<00:04:01.590> brushing<00:04:02.590> only

00:04:02.929 --> 00:04:02.939 
simple and then of course brushing only

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:06.479 
simple and then of course brushing only
addresses<00:04:03.939> 60%<00:04:04.930> of<00:04:05.139> the<00:04:05.319> tooth<00:04:05.530> surfaces<00:04:06.219> so

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
addresses 60% of the tooth surfaces so

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:08.550 
addresses 60% of the tooth surfaces so
that<00:04:06.639> leaves<00:04:06.900> 40%<00:04:07.900> more<00:04:08.109> of<00:04:08.260> the<00:04:08.379> tooth

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
that leaves 40% more of the tooth

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.220 
that leaves 40% more of the tooth
surfaces<00:04:09.069> that<00:04:09.250> are<00:04:09.310> not<00:04:09.430> being<00:04:09.790> addressed<00:04:10.230> by

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
surfaces that are not being addressed by

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:21.029 
surfaces that are not being addressed by
brushing<00:04:11.530> that's<00:04:12.489> where<00:04:12.699> flossing<00:04:20.039> so

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:21.039 
brushing that's where flossing so

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:23.580 
brushing that's where flossing so
there's<00:04:21.579> a<00:04:21.669> lot<00:04:21.940> of<00:04:22.120> different<00:04:22.509> things<00:04:22.780> you

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
there's a lot of different things you

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.409 
there's a lot of different things you
know<00:04:23.919> just<00:04:24.220> the<00:04:24.340> simple<00:04:24.669> things<00:04:24.880> brushing<00:04:25.300> and

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
know just the simple things brushing and

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:28.730 
know just the simple things brushing and
flossing<00:04:25.599> when<00:04:26.530> they're<00:04:26.710> done<00:04:26.889> correctly

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
flossing when they're done correctly

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.330 
flossing when they're done correctly
wonderful<00:04:30.120> but<00:04:31.120> the<00:04:31.479> other<00:04:31.690> factor<00:04:32.229> is<00:04:32.259> we<00:04:33.099> do

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
wonderful but the other factor is we do

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.730 
wonderful but the other factor is we do
need<00:04:33.610> to<00:04:33.639> have<00:04:33.970> regular<00:04:34.660> check-ups<00:04:34.960> to<00:04:35.440> watch

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
need to have regular check-ups to watch

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.939 
need to have regular check-ups to watch
when<00:04:36.310> with<00:04:36.580> there's<00:04:36.820> changes<00:04:37.509> changes<00:04:38.169> down

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:38.949 
when with there's changes changes down

00:04:38.949 --> 00:04:41.430 
when with there's changes changes down
that<00:04:39.130> slippery<00:04:39.490> slope<00:04:40.000> from<00:04:40.570> health<00:04:40.960> to

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
that slippery slope from health to

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.350 
that slippery slope from health to
disease<00:04:41.860> so<00:04:42.460> that<00:04:42.580> we<00:04:42.669> can<00:04:42.820> catch<00:04:43.030> things

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
disease so that we can catch things

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.010 
disease so that we can catch things
early<00:04:43.599> and<00:04:44.199> stop<00:04:45.130> them<00:04:45.370> right<00:04:45.580> there<00:04:46.020> so

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
early and stop them right there so

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.629 
early and stop them right there so
that's<00:04:47.440> them<00:04:47.949> and<00:04:48.340> hygienists<00:04:49.330> can<00:04:49.479> do<00:04:49.630> that

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
that's them and hygienists can do that

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:52.740 
that's them and hygienists can do that
