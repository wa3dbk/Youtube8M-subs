00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:08.379
 good for these exercises the tuning 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:10.990
 of the guitar is as follows all the 

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:12.610
 Strings performing the strict one is the 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.480
 regular tuning of the guitar the 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:19.360
 standard tuning the sixth that goes up 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:22.240
 a semitone means that the sixth 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:27.420
 remains in the note fa that is equivalent to 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.420
 the fourth string on the third fret 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.810
 the tuning is as follows 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.320
 the guitar is ready to play in the 

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:42.810
 tonality of F major or D minor 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.730
 let's do these exercises that are 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.670
 very important to play music 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.850
 in almost na in this particular style 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.220
 of bordeaux near and point at the same time 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.970
 position of the left hand is going to be 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:01:00.239
 always the index finger first string 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:03.239
 first fret the middle finger third 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.509
 second rope fret the little finger 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.830
 it remains on the second string third fret 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:13.619
 and the ring finger is available for 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.390
 do not step on any string then the 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.750
 first exercise that we have to do 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.470
 is this that is with the hand with the thumb 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.470
 of the right hand 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.039
 this base is very important because this 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.380
 is what will guide the rest of the 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:37.020
 music so we have to learn it 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:40.079
 memorize it and not receive me much for 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.619
 play for when we want pointer and 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.619
 touch at the same time 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.260
 it goes so slow 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.479
 now let's try a little more 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.479
 Quick 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:10.100
 now let's add the sound of the 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.100
 second string 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.800
 slow 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.769
 the 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:32.630
 Now let's add another sound 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.630
 on the second string there 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.599
 slower 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.950
 and 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.390
 do not 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.770
 i 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.770
 at a normal speed 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.260
 i 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.580
 let's add the sixth string 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.090
 slower 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.769
 Y 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.769
 i 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:30.510
 and this basic exercise to be able 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.910
 start us on the in the pulsation of the 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.910
 music in cajina in this style is 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:39.890
 important that they practice it with much 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:42.810
 regularity so that you can 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.590
 easily interpret the punctures 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.590
 which comes later 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.219
