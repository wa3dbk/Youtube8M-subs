national<00:00:45.390> championship<00:00:45.690> is<00:00:45.960> considered

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
national championship is considered

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.319 
national championship is considered
success<00:00:47.070> so<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:47.699> mean<00:00:47.850> that's<00:00:47.909> definitely<00:00:48.269> our

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
success so I mean that's definitely our

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.569 
success so I mean that's definitely our
goal<00:00:48.570> we're<00:00:48.839> young<00:00:49.280> we<00:00:50.280> have<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.429> good

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
goal we're young we have a good

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.399 
goal we're young we have a good
literally<00:00:50.969> played<00:00:51.629> together<00:00:51.780> that<00:00:52.079> long<00:00:52.109> and

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:52.409 
literally played together that long and

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:53.930 
literally played together that long and
stuff<00:00:52.559> like<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.710> our<00:00:52.920> point<00:00:53.129> guards<00:00:53.370> are<00:00:53.489> are

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
stuff like that our point guards are are

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.220 
stuff like that our point guards are are
still<00:00:54.210> pretty<00:00:54.359> fresh<00:00:54.629> they're<00:00:54.839> pretty<00:00:54.989> green

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
still pretty fresh they're pretty green

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.689 
still pretty fresh they're pretty green
so<00:00:55.859> I<00:00:55.920> think<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.129> even<00:00:56.219> some<00:00:56.429> growing<00:00:56.670> pains

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
so I think is even some growing pains

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.649 
so I think is even some growing pains
but<00:00:57.469> I<00:00:58.789> mean<00:00:59.789> I'm<00:00:59.909> definitely<00:00:59.969> excited<00:01:00.359> about

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:00.659 
but I mean I'm definitely excited about

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:02.090 
but I mean I'm definitely excited about
it<00:01:00.780> they're<00:01:00.929> eager<00:01:01.170> they're<00:01:01.499> good<00:01:01.679> attitudes

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
it they're eager they're good attitudes

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.660 
it they're eager they're good attitudes
