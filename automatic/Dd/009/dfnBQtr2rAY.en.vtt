00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.169
 last he wants at all costs and we will return 

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.770
 to the rioja chilecito 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:11.570
 we saw in the first block the ascent said machine in chile follow it to one of 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.460
 the most important mines of the walls the zone the mexican the station 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:16.299
 9 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.990
 we came to know in this way ideally expojove a very experience 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.990
 linda we live 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.530
 we owe the inhospitable of tocoa isaac pérez 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.570
 and to the bottom the station 9 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.650
 and the culture towers one of the ones feel like towers 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.320
 imposing complex the longest lane cable in the world 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.770
 the mexican chile values ​​site 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.459
 to station 9 

00:00:58.459 --> 00:01:00.790
 precisely from the mexican mine 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.249
 later on the street 

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:05.840
 this tourist site because it's money is the cable lane 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.650
 longest in the world that extracted all types of mineral in this area 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.500
 the Canarian base igic practically a museum of course is not in the 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.070
 entity and is that if a tour 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.109
 tourist like this years this stopped working 

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:26.129
 in 1926 it worked for the last time they are perfect 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:33.300
 everything referred to the cable lane not so the fourth conductions seismic zone 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.320
 i in meeting a development issue really 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.490
 It serves much to the subject and there we have the mouth of the Mexican 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.670
 even more than four thousand 650 meters high 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.050
 The famous one was very cold, an icy wind with a lot of sulfur 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:53.100
 exit from here in 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.080
 and well we were able to enter a few meters of tests ankle and 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.090
 this picture 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.940
 to share them 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.290
 with you we did a test 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.200
 given that according to a barometer and they will see after this note he took advantage 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.310
 with plastic bottles here in the mouth of the mine one sunny day a day 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.740
 normal aviacsa and one hundred millibars depression 

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:20.689
 for optically half of what there is that our city one day 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:22.209
 equal of climate 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.200
 but according to him it is handled in the little step walking little by little in it besides the 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.730
 problem the whole world can be visited country very much an attitude 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.989
 although what we saw before which but there is more a rival poop is almost 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.459
 600 meters less 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.009
 but that does it 

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:38.589
 the geography of heat 

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:41.189
 in these places it is and knives bulk 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:45.509
 each of the wagons that loaded almost 500 kilos 

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:47.509
 of this raw material 

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:49.610
 efe if it came up 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.610
 chilecito where was loaded in railroads 

00:02:56.039 --> 00:03:00.080
 messi sum ja two hundred 62 towers 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.959
 that make up this Mexican complex while 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.949
 they undertook the return 

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:08.660
 in our country our thanks also 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.039
 very special gendarmerie people 

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:13.470
 waited for magi mountain iam there 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.440
 for all the attentions received in this trip 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.209
 that we are going to have a lot more material in the next projects 

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:33.019
 in this tribute 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:38.459
 we were almost four thousand 600 meters above sea level 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.159
 imagine what it means for the physicist are going to enter for each unit 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:47.129
 any anomaly because the pressure in that area is impressive when 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:52.779
 we speak in fact in the return of the Mexican 600 Juan Vila respect pressure 

00:03:52.779 --> 00:03:54.949
 environmental hectopascals that is the same 

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:58.239
 when the average in our city of that rosary 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.419
 let's hope the parameters cheat 1020 

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:07.859
 980 990 before a terrible storm with a few simple regrets 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:10.409
 we did an experiment with bottles 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:16.480
 how are you, the temple stands out in the study approximately 33 or 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:21.569
 34 meters high that this area has the city of Rosario that is sheltered 

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:24.889
 we raise the order in pictures 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:27.969
 You can show these same plastic bottles 

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:33.330
 a is highly 4 thousand 640 meters high 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.370
 the admón so hard that you could not press with your finger 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:43.890
 the experiment was to empty a bankruptcy in mind when opening it only 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:47.680
 I had air, but with such pressure, I made the same noise when I opened one 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.110
 soda bottle 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.930
 that theresa theresa mosquee that level of pressure in reading 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.949
 we returned to descend of the four thousand 640 meters peace our study where we are 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:05.070
 now and see what these blows are, this of course the luxury of risking 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.689
 nor with those the state yes 

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:09.979
 I can spread a little 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:14.470
 ll like a standard air bottle but look what we follow with the idea comes out 

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:15.499
 the range 

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:17.569
 I really have lost 

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:21.449
 all its capacity at least two thirds 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:23.210
 per cent of the air I had 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:25.430
 imagine the local human body 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:29.870
 monagas our peoples in that area when one wonders why it costs 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:34.499
 so much to move mobilize to go up a step they begin alone 

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:37.770
 for that reason we are not for that the encounter happened we have to stop when 

00:05:37.769 --> 00:05:40.979
 Here we have a sample with this one liter plastic power and 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:42.150
 medium 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.169
 they are equivalent to two human lungs one looks at it by size 

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:51.809
 how they suffered this depression difference that almost blind to 50% lópez 

00:05:51.809 --> 00:05:55.009
 the environmental protection pressure that we have 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:06:00.660
 a lesson in physics in effect cheppi and tiredness up we looked like 90 

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:04.419
 years old but well it was worth the balance on the side it says there 

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:08.129
 you have to go because if this happens it will be pink well touristy 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:13.229
 will not have pain was the invasion of megamineras that want to destroy 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:17.729
 all this that they want to work with the modern methods that are great 

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:20.379
 trucks are not going to use cable lane again 

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:24.249
 what destruction and change the geography of each place you visit and 

00:06:24.249 --> 00:06:25.650
 of course poison
