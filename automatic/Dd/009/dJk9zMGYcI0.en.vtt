00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:07.790
 Hi there, an overview of the head unit 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.110
 based on android 4 1 1 specifically for 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:13.380
 of the forum 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:15.990
 lovers of s-max but the car in the cold 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:23.630
 condition she already stood about five 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:23.630
 hours on the street let's start the car 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:35.290
 that's how we see and are already included here for the sake of 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.290
 download starts android 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:43.200
 decreases android compared to my 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.570
 previous device fast enough 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.650
 a little faster here it is 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:53.550
 booted up like this radio 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:57.020
 as you can see the button illumination is red 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:01.620
 the device itself is matte 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:03.670
 fingers are not visible no gloves 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.130
 remains 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:09.350
 versailles true control buttons they 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:14.240
 absolutely standard for all devices 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:18.500
 this class here as you can see two 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:21.740
 micro sd card slots but working 11 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:27.140
 of them only works he left 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:30.140
 fuck it 2 fake or as prescribed 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.780
 Chinese instructions for storing 2 cards 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:36.200
 memory so as not to carry with you 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:39.340
 that they are very small so bad 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.340
 proper radio 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:56.290
 audio quality primary teach look fell 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:12.270
 well the station catches are much better than 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:18.920
 fountain frankly say search that is all 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:20.959
 he sees everything, he catches no noise 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.950
 third party 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.170
 home screen home screen looks like 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:30.810
 like that I really don't like it but 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:32.640
 what's plus android 4 you can do 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.970
 any taste and color 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.790
 In fact, this is a regular tablet which 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.540
 wrapped up such a frame for ford 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.650
 s-max and so panda too 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.680
 Respectively a little later I 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.290
 redo the main line here it is 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.140
 scrolls all very easily 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:56.819
 almost no false positives 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:03:02.269
 You see, the animation is very smooth and 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:02.269
 the device is very fast here 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.920
 what else features have a conclusion on 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:13.160
 display 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:21.209
 here the display is visible shows the radio 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:24.200
 shows the volume simultaneous here 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:28.579
 switching also works 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.579
 radio stations here 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:39.430
 here what else is there plus if you go to 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.560
 device settings here 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.650
 separate item 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:48.010
 which can be assigned at all absolutely 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:51.970
 any keys on your steering wheel 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:54.239
 including use this joystick then 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:57.760
 there is if you do not use often 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:04:00.540
 onboard computer these buttons too 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:03.819
 you can use to manage 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.379
 the head unit that is here we see 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:09.090
 various volume 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:11.919
 telephone functions traditional functions 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:14.939
 here all this can be reassigned 

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:14.939
 or do
