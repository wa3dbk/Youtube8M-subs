00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.640
 and what's up friends how are they here 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.950
 are left to make one that is x triangle is 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.740
 a new tutorial and well then this is 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:27.650
 nothing more and nothing less like here they read 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.349
 the title is like having a hundred 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.419
 national hundred here on July 4 and then 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:36.440
 well the first thing we need is going to 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:37.670
 be the programs that had already 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.570
 climbed in the history of halo reach 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.850
 well only today is what is this and we are going to 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.470
 occupy this little program that I am going to 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.170
 leave on the link so they can 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.870
 download and then the only thing basically 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.940
 What we have to do is open horizon and 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.910
 we are going to do almost the same thing as 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.940
 we did in halo reach extract the gp from 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.649
 that we occupy and good as you can see 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.020
 here is the new version update 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:04.280
 that looks a bit our good then 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.200
 let's do the same thing we're going to 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.600
 select him 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.030
 with what is called the preferred one we 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.740
 what we are going to do in this case I do not 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.619
 I will do it in giving them because I already 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.740
 I have done and it would be useless then 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:21.229
 I know in this new profile in Hindi that 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.000
 believe me so that or to have the 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.240
 water and so they can see that they can 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.009
 do and it's totally free without hobbies 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.799
 well now that we are here what 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:33.259
 same we go to the consensus folder of 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:37.310
 contents and we look for this example of 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:40.220
 which is here we put you extract as it says 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.720
 here what we do in this button and 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.459
 then selection where do I want to 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.819
 I put on a desk to make it more 

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:48.829
 easy we put you save and then here already 

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:51.439
 it's going to come out that has already been followed very well 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:53.479
 and now we can start now 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:57.049
 let's do four for frei modern 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:59.869
 we execute him get here he knows him 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:02.959
 open and here we are going to look for the one that 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:06.170
 we have that is this mobile and then here 

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:08.869
 this is where my magic runs 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.690
 here so that is the main thing so that 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.480
 have all that is what we put 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.989
 this here in this sense that is for 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.910
 unlock all weapons in armor 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.770
 postures and emblems here can 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.500
 add the experience that you 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:28.510
 want and equipment to modify can 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.510
 talk about services I will leave the same 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:35.470
 so as it is said so that if 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.239
 they want to have or for example the 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.000
 campaign already completed just give you here 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.130
 in x then select the campaign 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.030
 they put in area if they want because they are given 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:48.099
 two to unlock and so they go with 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.310
 all pretty well saying what 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:53.080
 same and I do not do it in this so that or 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.890
 if you can but I do not do it for 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.870
 do not delay so long 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.659
 basically this would be almost everything here 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.950
 it puts it nothing else there in this 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:05.980
 check them out of any program 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:09.040
 it lasts here they put it to send to the maximum 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.629
 maximum decorations and then 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.239
 basically it's all 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:15.519
 now if here modify the cars 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:18.670
 who want it to be good is what 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:21.340
 same but then they knocked them down better to 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.810
 change them in heaven 4 and well then 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.180
 friends here and nothing else once 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.110
 selected more you get in saving already 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.700
 is complete 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:30.430
 now if they did this program we 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:33.040
 we go again to horizon in the visual 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.329
 we select again the same gp from 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.150
 that will appear here a little 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:40.720
 probably as it has to be is the 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:43.060
 mouse and they are only going to replace and 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.989
 they are going to look for us where we work is in 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:49.989
 this can be opened already a mangana 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:51.549
 that they put him to follow and high and design and 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.799
 basically this would be all friends 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:56.170
 that we have everything and to check the 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:04:00.629
 that is served and that they can play in 2 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:00.629
 live, I'll see you in it 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.600
 and good friends, basically what 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.640
 is left to do here in the box and 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:09.350
 afterwards and modify the spartan to its 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.810
 like you can see here I had this 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:14.180
 to see if it works and also 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.800
 Well, here you already have all of them 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.750
 they have those of the father who 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.610
 he came with the in his half as by 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:25.040
 example come from permit holders 

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:28.360
 that are very small but for example these 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:33.970
 like this one good 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.970
 in the bulls this one comes after 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:43.600
 Well, if you have all the problems, all 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.900
 these advice will come well for you and 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.940
 as you can see it here these appear 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:51.910
 as well as I already had them because right now 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:54.400
 I'm modifying to put my emblem 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.470
 as I had it but I decided that it's better 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.870
 I made the video once and so good 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.940
 here is the proof that you already have everything 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:03.190
 is blocked for example look at this already 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.080
 is all the weight so in principle 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:08.020
 there is even the weapon that 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:11.410
 comes with the combine with the console 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:13.810
 of xbox xbox 360 halo 4 limited edition 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.490
 and well folks this has been all 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.950
 for my part in this video waiting for 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:20.220
 be used and see you in the next 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.220
 video
