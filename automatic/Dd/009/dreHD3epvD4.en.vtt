00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
think Robbie is a kind of game where I

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.910 
think Robbie is a kind of game where I
think<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.690> close<00:00:36.930> we<00:00:37.140> are<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.590> people

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
think the the close we are to the people

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.490 
think the the close we are to the people
you're<00:00:38.040> playing<00:00:38.280> with<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:39.320> the<00:00:40.320> more

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
you're playing with and the more

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.380 
you're playing with and the more
successful<00:00:40.680> you<00:00:41.129> can<00:00:41.309> be<00:00:41.489> as<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.670> team<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.000> think

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
successful you can be as a team I think

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.580 
successful you can be as a team I think
you<00:00:42.480> need<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.660> be<00:00:42.780> playing<00:00:43.110> for<00:00:43.289> each<00:00:43.410> other

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
you need to be playing for each other

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.380 
you need to be playing for each other
and<00:00:43.770> that's<00:00:43.890> probably<00:00:44.070> something<00:00:44.399> we<00:00:45.239> have

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
and that's probably something we have

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.990 
and that's probably something we have
always<00:00:45.600> done<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.200> probably<00:00:46.500> are<00:00:47.010> you<00:00:47.910> know

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
always done and probably are you know

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.369 
always done and probably are you know
the<00:00:48.120> fact<00:00:48.329> that<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.510> lot<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.840> socialized

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
the fact that a lot of a socialized

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.689 
the fact that a lot of a socialized
together<00:00:49.559> spend<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.070> lot<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.250> time<00:00:50.370> together

00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:50.699 
together spend a lot of time together

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:52.459 
together spend a lot of time together
down<00:00:51.030> through<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.360> years<00:00:51.390> that's<00:00:52.320> how<00:00:52.440> you

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
down through the years that's how you

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.529 
down through the years that's how you
can<00:00:52.770> see<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:53.070> was<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.280> big<00:00:53.430> contributor<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:54.510> that

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
can see it was a big contributor to that

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.090 
can see it was a big contributor to that
not<00:00:54.930> many<00:00:55.109> people<00:00:55.199> know<00:00:55.590> which<00:00:55.859> you<00:00:56.010> were

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
end up staying and swimming then till I

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.510 
end up staying and swimming then till I
was<00:01:14.310> about<00:01:14.370> 14<00:01:14.790> 15<00:01:15.210> years<00:01:15.690> of<00:01:15.840> age<00:01:15.990> but<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.590> think

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
was about 14 15 years of age but I think

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.060 
was about 14 15 years of age but I think
it's<00:01:18.240> funny<00:01:18.480> because<00:01:18.720> when<00:01:18.900> I<00:01:19.230> was<00:01:19.440> 11<00:01:19.770> or<00:01:19.890> 12

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
it's funny because when I was 11 or 12

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.650 
it's funny because when I was 11 or 12
years<00:01:20.310> of<00:01:20.400> age<00:01:20.520> actually<00:01:20.910> did<00:01:21.210> more<00:01:21.360> time

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:21.660 
years of age actually did more time
