general a hundred fifty dollar bill I
wouldn't<00:00:21.539> really<00:00:22.050> recommend<00:00:22.490> intel<00:00:23.490> nvidia

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
wouldn't really recommend intel nvidia

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.660 
wouldn't really recommend intel nvidia
i'd<00:00:24.029> say<00:00:24.240> intel<00:00:25.039> maybe<00:00:26.039> not<00:00:26.220> in<00:00:26.310> video<00:00:26.490> but

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
i'd say intel maybe not in video but

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.259 
i'd say intel maybe not in video but
intel<00:00:26.970> especially<00:00:27.480> is<00:00:27.689> mainly<00:00:28.109> for<00:00:28.529> the

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:29.269 
intel especially is mainly for the

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:31.999 
intel especially is mainly for the
thousand-dollar<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.750> up<00:00:30.960> builds<00:00:31.439> i<00:00:31.650> really

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
thousand-dollar and up builds i really

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.310 
thousand-dollar and up builds i really
don't<00:00:32.250> anything<00:00:33.210> below<00:00:33.360> that<00:00:33.540> you<00:00:33.989> know<00:00:34.079> like

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
budget built I pretty much always go

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.229 
budget built I pretty much always go
with<00:00:39.540> AMD<00:00:40.070> if<00:00:41.070> I'm<00:00:41.219> trying<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.550> get<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.790> best

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
with AMD if I'm trying to get the best

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.180 
with AMD if I'm trying to get the best
value<00:00:42.480> but<00:00:43.320> for<00:00:43.500> this<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:43.829> actually<00:00:43.950> got

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
value but for this I actually got

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.330 
value but for this I actually got
requested<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:44.940> do<00:00:45.090> an<00:00:46.050> intel<00:00:46.440> nvidia<00:00:46.829> build<00:00:47.070> I

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
requested to do an intel nvidia build I

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.459 
requested to do an intel nvidia build I
think<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.969> guy<00:00:48.059> who<00:00:48.120> was<00:00:48.239> using<00:00:48.570> this<00:00:49.170> build

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
think the guy who was using this build

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.040 
think the guy who was using this build
wanted<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.100> build<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:51.180> be<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.329> steam<00:00:51.690> machine

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
wanted to build it to be a steam machine

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.110 
wanted to build it to be a steam machine
also<00:00:52.860> I<00:00:52.890> asked<00:00:53.250> him<00:00:53.309> if<00:00:53.430> he<00:00:53.489> wanted<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:54.030> be

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
also I asked him if he wanted it to be

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.990 
also I asked him if he wanted it to be
mini-itx<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:55.110> he<00:00:55.170> said<00:00:55.350> no<00:00:55.760> because<00:00:56.760> there's

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
mini-itx and he said no because there's

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.630 
mini-itx and he said no because there's
no<00:00:57.120> point<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.539> just<00:00:57.570> makes<00:00:57.809> it<00:00:57.899> super<00:00:58.199> hot<00:00:58.230> and

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
no point it just makes it super hot and

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.180 
no point it just makes it super hot and
hard<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.760> work<00:00:59.940> with<00:01:00.149> which<00:01:00.449> is<00:01:01.129> totally<00:01:02.129> true

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
hard to work with which is totally true

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.830 
hard to work with which is totally true
so<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.180> mean<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:04.350> so<00:01:05.189> this<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.489> just<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:06.240> wouldn't

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
so I mean and so this is just I wouldn't

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.750 
so I mean and so this is just I wouldn't
really<00:01:07.439> say<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:08.070> this<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.400> best<00:01:08.520> value

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
really say that this is the best value

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.340 
really say that this is the best value
can<00:01:09.090> get<00:01:09.210> 48<00:01:09.420> out<00:01:09.540> of<00:01:09.570> 50<00:01:11.689> but<00:01:12.689> yeah<00:01:12.900> if<00:01:13.110> you<00:01:13.229> do

can get 48 out of 50 but yeah if you do

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.679 
can get 48 out of 50 but yeah if you do
1<00:01:13.470> 850<00:01:14.070> or<00:01:14.340> anywhere<00:01:15.150> in<00:01:15.270> that<00:01:15.330> price<00:01:15.540> range

1 850 or anywhere in that price range
intel<00:01:16.110> nvidia<00:01:16.409> build<00:01:16.619> this<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:16.950> what<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.280> go

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
intel nvidia build this is what you go

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.810 
intel nvidia build this is what you go
for<00:01:17.580> so<00:01:18.420> anyways<00:01:18.689> let's<00:01:19.140> get<00:01:19.229> into<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.530> build

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.860 
zhan NCIX
though<00:02:13.560> on<00:02:14.560> NCIX<00:02:15.280> if<00:02:15.459> you<00:02:15.519> buy<00:02:15.640> a<00:02:15.750> 4670k<00:02:16.750> you

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
though on NCIX if you buy a 4670k you

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.140 
though on NCIX if you buy a 4670k you
can<00:02:17.079> get<00:02:17.200> rome<00:02:17.409> total<00:02:17.620> war<00:02:17.799> two<00:02:18.159> so<00:02:19.000> if<00:02:19.060> you

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
can get rome total war two so if you

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.000 
can get rome total war two so if you
want<00:02:19.329> that<00:02:19.390> instead<00:02:19.959> of<00:02:20.019> final<00:02:20.560> fantasy<00:02:20.590> 14

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
want that instead of final fantasy 14

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.099 
want that instead of final fantasy 14
you<00:02:21.340> can<00:02:21.370> go<00:02:21.549> get<00:02:21.670> that<00:02:21.909> but<00:02:22.599> personally<00:02:23.049> i

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:23.109 
you can go get that but personally i

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:24.569 
you can go get that but personally i
like<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.439> cpu<00:02:23.799> more<00:02:24.040> just<00:02:24.219> because<00:02:24.310> it's

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:24.579 
like the cpu more just because it's

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:27.209 
like the cpu more just because it's
easier<00:02:24.969> to<00:02:25.090> overclock<00:02:25.480> and<00:02:25.750> yeah<00:02:26.500> so<00:02:27.010> for<00:02:27.159> the

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:27.219 
easier to overclock and yeah so for the

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:28.559 
easier to overclock and yeah so for the
cpu<00:02:27.489> cooler<00:02:27.670> as<00:02:27.819> i<00:02:27.939> said<00:02:28.120> i<00:02:28.150> went<00:02:28.420> with<00:02:28.480> the

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
cpu cooler as i said i went with the

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.500 
cpu cooler as i said i went with the
cooler<00:02:28.840> master<00:02:29.230> hyper<00:02:29.260> 212<00:02:29.709> evo<00:02:30.340> cpu<00:02:31.239> cooler

right<00:02:31.870> now<00:02:31.989> this<00:02:32.230> is<00:02:32.409> 2998<00:02:33.189> as<00:02:33.459> it<00:02:33.640> has<00:02:33.790> been

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
right now this is 2998 as it has been

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.420 
right now this is 2998 as it has been
pretty<00:02:34.689> much<00:02:34.900> like<00:02:35.260> forever<00:02:35.709> because<00:02:36.220> it<00:02:36.340> has

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
pretty much like forever because it has

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.640 
pretty much like forever because it has
a<00:02:36.459> five<00:02:36.700> dollar<00:02:36.879> mail-in<00:02:37.269> rebate<00:02:37.569> and<00:02:37.810> i<00:02:38.590> know

gigahertz<00:02:44.290> all<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:44.799> way<00:02:44.920> to<00:02:45.030> 4.5<00:02:46.030> i<00:02:46.480> wouldn't

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
gigahertz all the way to 4.5 i wouldn't

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.379 
gigahertz all the way to 4.5 i wouldn't
really<00:02:47.439> go<00:02:47.769> to<00:02:47.799> 4.5<00:02:48.370> is<00:02:48.700> it's<00:02:48.879> not<00:02:49.000> that<00:02:49.180> safe

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:49.389 
really go to 4.5 is it's not that safe

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:52.530 
really go to 4.5 is it's not that safe
I'd<00:02:50.079> probably<00:02:50.409> go<00:02:50.620> 24<00:02:51.010> or<00:02:51.220> 4.2<00:02:51.700> and<00:02:51.849> you'd<00:02:52.450> be

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
I'd probably go 24 or 4.2 and you'd be

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.500 
I'd probably go 24 or 4.2 and you'd be
totally<00:02:52.750> safe<00:02:53.049> there<00:02:53.379> and<00:02:54.090> basically<00:02:55.090> as<00:02:55.450> soon

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
totally safe there and basically as soon

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:56.909 
totally safe there and basically as soon
as<00:02:55.780> you<00:02:55.870> get<00:02:55.989> the<00:02:56.079> CPU<00:02:56.439> you're<00:02:56.620> going<00:02:56.739> to<00:02:56.799> have

00:02:56.909 --> 00:02:56.919 
as you get the CPU you're going to have

00:02:56.919 --> 00:02:58.409 
as you get the CPU you're going to have
to<00:02:57.010> run<00:02:57.159> a<00:02:57.189> few<00:02:57.250> tests<00:02:57.519> once<00:02:57.790> you<00:02:57.879> start<00:02:58.359> off

00:02:58.409 --> 00:02:58.419

seeing<00:02:58.750> obviously<00:02:58.959> but<00:03:00.359> you<00:03:01.359> could<00:03:01.510> totally

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
seeing obviously but you could totally

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:05.139 
than the fractal design define r4 and it

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:09.149 
than the fractal design define r4 and it
is<00:06:05.409> a<00:06:05.680> great<00:06:06.659> case<00:06:07.659> pretty<00:06:08.229> much<00:06:08.409> same<00:06:08.680> quality

that's<00:06:40.250> pretty<00:06:40.490> awesome<00:06:40.840> so<00:06:41.840> there's<00:06:42.440> really

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:42.620 
that's pretty awesome so there's really

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.740 
that's pretty awesome so there's really
not<00:06:42.860> much<00:06:43.070> you<00:06:43.220> can<00:06:43.340> get<00:06:43.880> better<00:06:44.180> for<00:06:44.390> that<00:06:44.450> and

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:44.750 
not much you can get better for that and

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:48.310 
not much you can get better for that and
honestly<00:06:45.020> I<00:06:45.410> think<00:06:46.130> for<00:06:46.550> most<00:06:47.540> graphics<00:06:48.020> cards

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:48.320 
honestly I think for most graphics cards

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.020 
honestly I think for most graphics cards
all<00:06:48.470> you<00:06:48.620> really<00:06:48.800> need<00:06:49.040> is<00:06:49.070> 600<00:06:49.580> watts<00:06:49.730> even

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:50.030 
all you really need is 600 watts even

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:53.050 
all you really need is 600 watts even
though<00:06:50.120> they<00:06:50.240> don't<00:06:50.330> use<00:06:50.720> that<00:06:51.700> most<00:06:52.700> graphics

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:53.060 
though they don't use that most graphics

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.510 
though they don't use that most graphics
cards<00:06:53.360> and<00:06:53.510> most<00:06:53.690> PC<00:06:53.990> components<00:06:54.230> require<00:06:54.830> 600

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:55.520 
cards and most PC components require 600

00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:01.900 
cards and most PC components require 600
to<00:06:55.640> run<00:06:57.190> most<00:06:58.190> mid<00:06:58.490> to<00:06:58.640> high-end<00:06:58.820> ones<00:06:59.740> i<00:07:00.910> know
