handling but really for no loss in
comfort<00:03:43.700> and<00:03:43.850> I<00:03:43.880> reckon<00:03:44.329> this<00:03:44.660> is<00:03:44.900> the<00:03:45.170> best

about a week with this car and during

about a week with this car and during
that<00:04:46.910> time<00:04:47.120> I've<00:04:47.449> discovered<00:04:48.169> a<00:04:48.350> few

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
that time I've discovered a few

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:51.159 
that time I've discovered a few

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
idiosyncrasies for instance I really

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:52.060 
idiosyncrasies for instance I really
like<00:04:51.320> the<00:04:51.440> way<00:04:51.530> you<00:04:51.590> control<00:04:51.800> the

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:52.070 
like the way you control the

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:53.680 
like the way you control the
infotainment<00:04:52.370> system<00:04:53.060> with<00:04:53.090> this<00:04:53.300> swivel

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
infotainment system with this swivel

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.719 
infotainment system with this swivel
wheel<00:04:54.020> and<00:04:54.350> touch<00:04:54.650> pad<00:04:54.949> which<00:04:55.190> is<00:04:55.220> standard

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:55.729 
wheel and touch pad which is standard

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:57.670 
wheel and touch pad which is standard
across<00:04:55.880> the<00:04:56.000> range<00:04:56.169> it's<00:04:57.169> just<00:04:57.320> that<00:04:57.440> I<00:04:57.500> think

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
across the range it's just that I think

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.650 
across the range it's just that I think
this<00:04:57.740> touch<00:04:58.039> pad<00:04:58.070> does<00:04:58.639> get<00:04:58.880> slightly<00:04:59.270> in<00:04:59.539> the

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
this touch pad does get slightly in the

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.420 
this touch pad does get slightly in the
way<00:04:59.780> of<00:05:00.139> the<00:05:00.320> swivel<00:05:00.770> wheel<00:05:00.949> and<00:05:01.160> I'm<00:05:01.220> kind<00:05:01.400> of

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
way of the swivel wheel and I'm kind of

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:02.830 
way of the swivel wheel and I'm kind of
wish<00:05:01.610> Mercedes<00:05:02.090> have<00:05:02.210> put<00:05:02.389> their<00:05:02.539> direct

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
wish Mercedes have put their direct

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.510 
wish Mercedes have put their direct
navigation<00:05:03.380> buttons<00:05:03.680> rather<00:05:04.130> up<00:05:04.280> there<00:05:04.430> on

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169 
the dash with the swivel wheel it just

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:08.260 
the dash with the swivel wheel it just
makes<00:05:06.350> more<00:05:06.620> sense<00:05:07.039> and<00:05:07.340> then<00:05:07.940> there's<00:05:08.180> the

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
makes more sense and then there's the

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.480 
makes more sense and then there's the
seating<00:05:08.630> position<00:05:08.750> now<00:05:09.289> the<00:05:09.440> seat<00:05:09.800> they<00:05:10.220> are
