00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.120
 that is not a complex issue is very 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.920
 well here I leave you with the good unboxing 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.460
 as it is not surprise here you have a cell 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.960
 wind waker hd paraguay is this 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:49.700
 edition comes with a figure of 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.500
 ganondorf we're going to see it right now 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.720
 he comes with the game of physical format 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.060
 of course a code has come 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.740
 digital let's go to win boxing 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.630
 a digital edition is for me 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.420
 kill you do not look for the ip and kill me 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.560
 well it comes in this little box it is not 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.530
 The truth is that it is not very 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.700
 great but it's very good about everything 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.600
 achieved by hand comes what's best from 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.700
 everything is that I do not any manual 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.710
 instructions to mount anything because 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.450
 really is to draw the figure you put the 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.619
 urn above and it's already good here the 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.420
 you have to come with this so that it is 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.280
 well well padded is fine 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.770
 quiet that you know is my cell 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.970
 favorite as much as they tell me smith 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.280
 the favorite one and I think it's the best 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.930
 cell because they have many things that 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.690
 do not 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.180
 and the truth is that I loved it and I 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.920
 transmitted many very good things to 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.030
 that you see the detail different since not 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.340
 it's a very complex edition as I have 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.110
 said before this is the box of the 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.000
 edition the wild and now I 'm going to 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.820
 show a small detail of the edition 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.229
 of gamecube that you do not see it coming 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.580
 there you have the edition of gamecube that 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.860
 now when the wta you will see that in the 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.920
 discs are not because I have them in a 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.810
 sure thing so they do not get scratched in the 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.550
 this in the box but good here you have 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.840
 well what was coming then they are 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.700
 stars that you are accumulating and you go 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.110

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.830
 I bought how strong how strong does a lot of 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.390
 It's a pity that there are no manuals 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.920
 instructions guys the truth but 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.270
