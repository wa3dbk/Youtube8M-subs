on<00:01:38.340> this<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:39.049> that's<00:01:40.049> usually<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.500> sign<00:01:40.590> of

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
on this and that's usually a sign of

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.429 
on this and that's usually a sign of
watering<00:01:41.820> problem<00:01:42.329> too<00:01:42.509> much<00:01:42.659> moisture<00:01:42.840> water

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
watering problem too much moisture water

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.280 
watering problem too much moisture water
in<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.710> soil<00:01:43.890> could<00:01:44.820> be<00:01:44.880> because<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.899> poor

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
in the soil could be because of the poor

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.280 
in the soil could be because of the poor
soil<00:01:46.590> or<00:01:46.950> you're<00:01:47.189> over<00:01:47.520> watering<00:01:47.850> or<00:01:48.479> bad

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
soil or you're over watering or bad

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.870 
soil or you're over watering or bad
drainage<00:01:49.770> so<00:01:50.040> what<00:01:50.189> I<00:01:50.220> did<00:01:50.460> is<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.610> couple<00:01:50.820> of

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
drainage so what I did is a couple of

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.969 
drainage so what I did is a couple of
days<00:01:50.970> ago<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.240> transplanted<00:01:52.020> this<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.470> I<00:01:52.799> think

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
days ago I transplanted this and I think

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.200 
days ago I transplanted this and I think
it's<00:01:53.130> going<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.280> be<00:01:53.399> okay<00:01:53.610> because<00:01:53.729> I<00:01:53.939> love

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
it's going to be okay because I love

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.370 
it's going to be okay because I love
this<00:01:54.360> little<00:01:54.570> one<00:01:54.750> this<00:01:54.840> one's<00:01:55.020> really<00:01:55.170> going

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
this little one this one's really going

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.149 
this little one this one's really going
to<00:01:55.470> be<00:01:55.560> cute

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
to be cute

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.429 
to be cute
you<00:01:56.909> know<00:01:57.000> once<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:57.299> gets<00:01:57.450> going<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:57.960> think<00:01:58.350> I've

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
you know once it gets going I think I've

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.190 
you know once it gets going I think I've
ever<00:01:58.680> asked<00:01:58.860> you<00:01:59.009> down<00:01:59.159> one<00:01:59.750> this<00:02:00.750> this<00:02:00.990> here

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
ever asked you down one this this here

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.719 
ever asked you down one this this here
is<00:02:01.320> really<00:02:01.500> beautiful<00:02:01.950> this<00:02:02.189> one's<00:02:02.399> got<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.549> lot

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
is really beautiful this one's got a lot

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.899 
is really beautiful this one's got a lot
of<00:02:02.790> potential<00:02:04.070> and<00:02:05.070> my<00:02:05.189> tamarins<00:02:05.700> are

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
of potential and my tamarins are

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.270 
of potential and my tamarins are
interesting<00:02:06.799> how<00:02:07.799> they're<00:02:07.979> starting<00:02:08.099> to

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
interesting how they're starting to

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.999 
interesting how they're starting to
curve<00:02:08.429> like<00:02:08.640> that<00:02:08.989> now<00:02:09.989> maybe<00:02:10.289> next<00:02:10.619> year<00:02:10.830> I'll

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
curve like that now maybe next year I'll

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.260 
curve like that now maybe next year I'll
probably<00:02:11.160> wait<00:02:11.400> another<00:02:11.610> year<00:02:11.760> when<00:02:12.180> I'll

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
probably wait another year when I'll

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.050 
probably wait another year when I'll
start<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.569> train<00:02:12.780> these<00:02:12.930> with<00:02:13.140> wire

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
start to train these with wire

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.640 
start to train these with wire
dr.<00:02:15.060> trainees<00:02:15.420> bonsai<00:02:15.780> wire<00:02:16.050> maybe<00:02:16.290> two<00:02:16.530> to

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
dr. trainees bonsai wire maybe two to

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.900 
dr. trainees bonsai wire maybe two to
three<00:02:16.680> years<00:02:17.100> it<00:02:17.220> depends<00:02:17.490> on<00:02:17.610> how<00:02:17.730> they<00:02:17.850> do

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
three years it depends on how they do

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.000 
three years it depends on how they do
once<00:02:18.600> they<00:02:18.750> start<00:02:18.960> getting<00:02:19.080> a<00:02:19.290> woody<00:02:19.500> trunk

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
once they start getting a woody trunk

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.660 
once they start getting a woody trunk
here<00:02:20.190> like<00:02:20.340> this

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
here like this

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.430 
here like this
let's<00:02:21.030> wood<00:02:21.300> then<00:02:22.170> you<00:02:22.260> can<00:02:22.380> start<00:02:22.590> to<00:02:22.680> tram

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.680 

I<00:02:25.490> haven't<00:02:26.490> I've<00:02:26.640> done<00:02:26.820> very<00:02:27.090> little<00:02:27.180> trimming

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
I haven't I've done very little trimming

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.750 
I haven't I've done very little trimming
on<00:02:27.840> them<00:02:28.020> you<00:02:28.410> need<00:02:28.740> to<00:02:28.800> trim<00:02:29.160> bonsai<00:02:29.550> for<00:02:29.700> a

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
on them you need to trim bonsai for a

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.760 
on them you need to trim bonsai for a
bunch<00:02:29.910> of<00:02:30.000> different<00:02:30.210> reasons<00:02:30.560> aesthetics<00:02:31.560> of

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
bunch of different reasons aesthetics of

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.050 
bunch of different reasons aesthetics of
it<00:02:31.890> like<00:02:32.070> for<00:02:32.220> instance<00:02:32.340> take<00:02:32.640> a<00:02:32.670> look<00:02:32.880> at<00:02:32.940> this

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
it like for instance take a look at this

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.910 
it like for instance take a look at this
one<00:02:33.210> here<00:02:33.390> you<00:02:34.020> can<00:02:34.200> see<00:02:34.350> how<00:02:34.500> there<00:02:34.680> is<00:02:34.800> a

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
one here you can see how there is a

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.820 
one here you can see how there is a
branch<00:02:35.190> here<00:02:35.930> branch<00:02:36.930> right<00:02:37.140> across<00:02:37.350> from<00:02:37.620> and

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
branch here branch right across from and

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.560 
branch here branch right across from and
two<00:02:37.890> branches<00:02:38.220> like<00:02:38.340> that<00:02:38.580> you<00:02:39.420> know<00:02:39.540> a

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
two branches like that you know a

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.990 
two branches like that you know a
typical<00:02:39.810> bonsai<00:02:40.500> artist<00:02:40.890> would<00:02:41.040> trim<00:02:41.760> one<00:02:41.910> of

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
typical bonsai artist would trim one of

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.750 
typical bonsai artist would trim one of
those<00:02:42.090> off<00:02:42.440> for<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.530> look<00:02:43.740> of<00:02:43.890> it<00:02:44.070> and<00:02:44.190> there's

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
those off for the look of it and there's

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.940 
those off for the look of it and there's
a<00:02:44.820> few<00:02:44.970> different<00:02:45.300> rules<00:02:45.510> for<00:02:45.690> trimming<00:02:46.050> also

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
a few different rules for trimming also

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.460 
a few different rules for trimming also
like<00:02:47.220> this<00:02:47.430> one<00:02:47.640> canopy<00:02:48.600> is<00:02:48.690> awfully<00:02:49.140> big<00:02:49.320> on

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
like this one canopy is awfully big on

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.730 
like this one canopy is awfully big on
this<00:02:49.590> one<00:02:49.650> and<00:02:50.330> the<00:02:51.330> canopy<00:02:51.750> has<00:02:52.200> a<00:02:52.260> direct

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
this one and the canopy has a direct

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.680 
this one and the canopy has a direct
proportion<00:02:53.460> to<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.910> amount<00:02:54.090> of<00:02:54.330> soil<00:02:54.570> you

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
proportion to the amount of soil you

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.400 
proportion to the amount of soil you
have<00:02:54.930> so<00:02:55.920> this<00:02:56.790> canopy<00:02:57.120> is<00:02:57.360> dragging<00:02:57.900> a<00:02:57.990> lot<00:02:58.260> of

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
have so this canopy is dragging a lot of

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.140 
have so this canopy is dragging a lot of
nutrients<00:02:59.220> out<00:02:59.310> of<00:02:59.340> the<00:02:59.430> soil<00:02:59.640> and<00:02:59.880> we<00:03:00.000> don't

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
nutrients out of the soil and we don't

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.970 
nutrients out of the soil and we don't
want<00:03:00.330> it<00:03:00.360> to<00:03:00.480> drag<00:03:00.660> too<00:03:00.900> much<00:03:01.080> so<00:03:01.710> we<00:03:01.830> would

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
want it to drag too much so we would

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.180 
want it to drag too much so we would
trim<00:03:02.250> this<00:03:02.400> canopy<00:03:02.820> down<00:03:03.000> a<00:03:03.060> little<00:03:03.300> bit<00:03:04.190> it's

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
trim this canopy down a little bit it's

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.040 
trim this canopy down a little bit it's
all<00:03:05.280> about<00:03:05.430> how<00:03:05.610> much<00:03:05.790> energy<00:03:06.330> you<00:03:06.720> have<00:03:06.750> in

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
all about how much energy you have in

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.760 
all about how much energy you have in
that<00:03:07.200> soil<00:03:07.470> and<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:08.040> water<00:03:09.080> well<00:03:10.080> anyway<00:03:10.470> so

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
that soil and the water well anyway so

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.130 
that soil and the water well anyway so
that's<00:03:11.490> the<00:03:11.730> bonsai<00:03:12.030> from<00:03:12.060> seed<00:03:12.390> one<00:03:12.840> year

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
that's the bonsai from seed one year

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.140 
that's the bonsai from seed one year
later<00:03:13.410> and<00:03:13.740> if<00:03:14.640> you<00:03:14.760> were<00:03:14.850> thinking<00:03:15.120> about

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
later and if you were thinking about

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.390 
later and if you were thinking about
doing<00:03:15.540> it<00:03:15.630> then<00:03:15.810> and<00:03:16.050> you<00:03:16.110> didn't<00:03:16.410> well<00:03:16.860> it's<00:03:17.280> a

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
doing it then and you didn't well it's a

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.280 
doing it then and you didn't well it's a
year<00:03:17.580> later<00:03:17.760> but<00:03:17.970> so<00:03:18.180> uh<00:03:18.209> you<00:03:18.780> want<00:03:18.959> to<00:03:19.020> do<00:03:19.110> some

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290
