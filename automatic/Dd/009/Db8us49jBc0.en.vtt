so<00:01:39.910> it's<00:01:40.360> quite<00:01:40.480> a<00:01:40.540> dynamic<00:01:40.900> process<00:01:40.930> I'll<00:01:41.650> go

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
so it's quite a dynamic process I'll go

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.950 
so it's quite a dynamic process I'll go
back<00:01:41.860> nicely<00:01:42.070> say<00:01:42.310> look<00:01:42.820> Ken<00:01:43.150> this<00:01:43.300> section<00:01:43.720> be

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
back nicely say look Ken this section be

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.510 
back nicely say look Ken this section be

literally can do anything a lot of the
basic<00:01:55.750> concept<00:01:56.320> that<00:01:56.470> I've<00:01:56.590> been<00:01:56.770> learning<00:01:56.920> in
