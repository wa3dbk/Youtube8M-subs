00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.360
 to cut paper like this tape 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:03.160
 decorated waters and tape decorated paper 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.490
 ribbon laces and lace and something for 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.490
 decorate 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.570
 and let's see how it is done first 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:16.340
 you have to cut the cardboard with the 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.340
 same size of photocopy 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.430
 then with a pencil take the measurement 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.360
 draw some lines and cut them 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:44.170
 Now take a piece of cardboard that is going 

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:44.170
 to need to cover the table 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:55.460
 and start folding in half your 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.460
 cardboard in this way 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:06.950
 take the piece of cardboard 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:11.440
 put over the open cardboard 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.440
 secure it with a few pieces of tape 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.660
 and above also the photocopy with the 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.660
 egg 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.549
 and now how does this care record the form 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.549
 of course with the cutter 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.319
 now here is the photocopy and also 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.319
 tape 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.720
 and keeps cutting the shape of then with 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.720
 the cutter 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.180
 and once cut this is what you 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.540
 remains 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.609
 a card with a hole shaped like 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.189
 egg now catch another piece of 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:58.180
 cardboard the same size as half 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:58.180
 of the card 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:14.980
 with the instrument to cut the paper 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:19.260
 cut a set of decorated paper 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.260
 I have chosen this paper with flowers 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:30.629
 Now you need to draw the shape of 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:33.620
 again again on the piece of half 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:37.099
 of the cardboard 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:41.769
 and stick it on the decorated ribbon and the 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:41.769
 alternating decorated letter lists 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.000
 to carve the paper lists used 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.000
 glue stick 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:05.550
 and this is what remains now only 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:08.950
 you need to stick with glue in bar 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:11.550
 this part to the part of the card in 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.550
 this way 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:32.190
 now if you want you can leave your card 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:35.880
 so simple or decorate it with lace with 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:38.169
 strips with pearls and everything that you 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.840
 like more 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:46.469
 and this is the result I have chosen 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.469
 decorate it with lace laces and fabric 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:51.369
 on the outside and also on the inside 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.990
