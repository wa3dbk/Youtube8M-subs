00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:51.849 
coverage that it's given me in the fact

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:54.659 
coverage that it's given me in the fact
that<00:05:51.969> it<00:05:52.300> has<00:05:52.960> not<00:05:53.169> rubbed<00:05:53.590> off<00:05:53.830> at<00:05:54.130> all<00:05:54.310> and

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:54.669 
that it has not rubbed off at all and

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:56.640 
that it has not rubbed off at all and
just<00:05:54.849> like<00:05:54.969> I<00:05:55.090> said<00:05:55.150> I<00:05:55.389> did<00:05:55.630> not<00:05:55.780> set<00:05:56.050> it<00:05:56.199> with<00:05:56.620> a

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650 
just like I said I did not set it with a

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.760 
just like I said I did not set it with a
powder<00:05:56.800> at<00:05:57.400> all<00:05:57.759> today<00:05:58.270> but<00:05:58.870> it<00:05:59.020> looks<00:05:59.289> really

00:05:59.760 --> 00:05:59.770 
powder at all today but it looks really

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:01.709 
powder at all today but it looks really
really<00:05:59.800> good<00:06:00.070> I<00:06:00.520> did<00:06:00.969> notice<00:06:01.210> that<00:06:01.360> every

00:06:01.709 --> 00:06:01.719 
really good I did notice that every

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:03.149 
really good I did notice that every
single<00:06:01.990> time<00:06:02.169> that<00:06:02.380> I<00:06:02.409> would<00:06:02.710> blow<00:06:02.949> my<00:06:03.099> nose

00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:03.159 
single time that I would blow my nose

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:05.580 
single time that I would blow my nose
that<00:06:03.969> some<00:06:04.330> of<00:06:04.449> the<00:06:04.539> foundation<00:06:05.080> would<00:06:05.320> come

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:05.590 
that some of the foundation would come

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:07.140 
that some of the foundation would come
off<00:06:05.800> on<00:06:06.130> the<00:06:06.250> tissue<00:06:06.430> and<00:06:06.789> things<00:06:06.969> like<00:06:07.090> that

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
off on the tissue and things like that

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.360 
off on the tissue and things like that
but<00:06:07.509> that<00:06:07.719> was<00:06:07.990> pretty<00:06:08.320> much<00:06:08.440> expected

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:09.370 
but that was pretty much expected

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:12.300 
but that was pretty much expected
overall<00:06:10.240> it<00:06:10.659> looks<00:06:10.719> really<00:06:11.590> good<00:06:11.800> the<00:06:12.039> color

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:12.310 
overall it looks really good the color

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.879 
overall it looks really good the color
