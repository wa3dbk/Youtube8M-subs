00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:40.939 
and the next clip you see will be
recorded<00:04:35.370> with<00:04:35.840> the<00:04:36.840> new<00:04:37.050> camcorder<00:04:38.930> and<00:04:39.949> now

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:40.949 
recorded with the new camcorder and now

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:43.909 
recorded with the new camcorder and now
finally<00:04:42.139> segment<00:04:43.139> that<00:04:43.260> you're<00:04:43.440> looking<00:04:43.770> at

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
finally segment that you're looking at

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:47.060 
finally segment that you're looking at
right<00:04:44.190> now<00:04:44.240> was<00:04:45.240> recorded<00:04:45.870> with<00:04:46.470> the<00:04:46.590> Toshiba

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
right now was recorded with the Toshiba

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.420 
right now was recorded with the Toshiba
camel<00:04:47.370> arx100<00:04:48.240> and<00:04:48.539> I<00:04:49.349> can<00:04:50.039> prove<00:04:50.190> that

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
camel arx100 and I can prove that

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.659 
camel arx100 and I can prove that
because<00:04:50.699> this<00:04:51.630> is<00:04:51.780> the<00:04:51.930> flip<00:04:52.199> so<00:04:53.190> if<00:04:53.520> I'm

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
because this is the flip so if I'm

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:55.250 
because this is the flip so if I'm
holding<00:04:54.000> the<00:04:54.090> flip<00:04:54.270> I<00:04:54.389> can't<00:04:54.630> possibly<00:04:54.810> be

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
holding the flip I can't possibly be

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.719 
holding the flip I can't possibly be
using<00:04:55.590> it<00:04:55.680> to<00:04:55.800> record<00:04:56.449> so<00:04:57.949> the<00:04:58.949> clips<00:04:59.340> that<00:04:59.580> you

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
using it to record so the clips that you

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:02.420 
using it to record so the clips that you
saw<00:04:59.970> before<00:05:00.270> this<00:05:00.840> one<00:05:01.139> were<00:05:01.860> recorded<00:05:02.400> with

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
saw before this one were recorded with

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:10.070 
saw before this one were recorded with
the<00:05:02.639> flip<00:05:03.289> at<00:05:04.289> 720p<00:05:05.090> and<00:05:08.000> this<00:05:09.000> clip<00:05:09.330> is<00:05:09.720> now

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
the flip at 720p and this clip is now

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.220 
the flip at 720p and this clip is now
being<00:05:10.380> recorded<00:05:10.680> at<00:05:11.220> 1080p

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:14.230 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.620 

I<00:05:14.670> think<00:05:15.670> what<00:05:15.820> I'm<00:05:15.880> probably<00:05:16.030> going<00:05:16.300> to<00:05:16.390> do<00:05:16.480> is

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
I think what I'm probably going to do is

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:19.140 
I think what I'm probably going to do is
it<00:05:16.780> for<00:05:16.990> most<00:05:17.200> cases<00:05:17.530> for<00:05:17.980> ordinary<00:05:18.340> vlogs<00:05:18.790> and

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
it for most cases for ordinary vlogs and

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.660 
it for most cases for ordinary vlogs and
such<00:05:19.360> I'm<00:05:19.870> just<00:05:20.230> going<00:05:20.410> to<00:05:20.470> go<00:05:20.620> with<00:05:20.860> the<00:05:21.040> with

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:21.670 
such I'm just going to go with the with

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:25.770 
such I'm just going to go with the with
the<00:05:21.820> 720p<00:05:22.630> mode<00:05:23.050> on<00:05:23.380> the<00:05:23.590> Toshiba<00:05:24.010> and<00:05:24.780> the

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 
the 720p mode on the Toshiba and the

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.630 
the 720p mode on the Toshiba and the
reason<00:05:26.110> for<00:05:26.260> this<00:05:26.380> is<00:05:26.620> file<00:05:26.980> size<00:05:27.310> and

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:27.640 
reason for this is file size and

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.970 
reason for this is file size and
rendering<00:05:28.120> time<00:05:29.310> more<00:05:30.310> special<00:05:30.760> things<00:05:31.000> like

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:31.980 
rendering time more special things like

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.920 
rendering time more special things like
watching<00:05:32.980> bad<00:05:33.340> videos<00:05:33.790> so<00:05:34.120> you<00:05:34.180> don't<00:05:34.450> have<00:05:34.690> to

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
watching bad videos so you don't have to

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.590 
watching bad videos so you don't have to
backtrack<00:05:35.590> episodes<00:05:36.370> to<00:05:36.640> troll<00:05:36.880> wars<00:05:37.240> video

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600 
backtrack episodes to troll wars video

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.630 
backtrack episodes to troll wars video
and<00:05:39.240> other<00:05:40.680> quote/unquote<00:05:41.680> special<00:05:42.340> things

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:42.640 
and other quote/unquote special things

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:48.390 
and other quote/unquote special things
will<00:05:43.570> be<00:05:43.690> done<00:05:43.900> at<00:05:44.110> 1080p<00:05:44.590> and<00:05:46.350> I<00:05:47.350> kind<00:05:48.190> of<00:05:48.220> like

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
will be done at 1080p and I kind of like
