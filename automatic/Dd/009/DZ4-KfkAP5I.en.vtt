the covers on the iphone let's start

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.630 
the covers on the iphone let's start
with<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.030> headset<00:02:12.270> jack<00:02:12.720> cover<00:02:13.340> just<00:02:14.340> drop<00:02:14.610> it

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
with a headset jack cover just drop it

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.820 
with a headset jack cover just drop it
in<00:02:14.970> here<00:02:15.239> then<00:02:15.810> push<00:02:16.140> it<00:02:16.320> until<00:02:16.470> it's

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
in here then push it until it's

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.560 
in here then push it until it's
completely<00:02:17.220> in<00:02:19.100> there's<00:02:20.100> a<00:02:20.190> s<00:02:20.550> symbol<00:02:21.150> on<00:02:21.330> the

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
completely in there's a s symbol on the

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.510 
completely in there's a s symbol on the
headset<00:02:21.900> jack<00:02:22.170> over<00:02:22.590> which<00:02:22.830> I<00:02:23.040> guess<00:02:23.280> means

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
headset jack over which I guess means

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.500 
headset jack over which I guess means
