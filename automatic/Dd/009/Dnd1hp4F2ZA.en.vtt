00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
like that and the speed will depend on

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.790 
like that and the speed will depend on
how<00:02:26.940> big<00:02:27.330> it<00:02:27.480> is<00:02:27.570> so<00:02:27.900> some<00:02:28.290> games<00:02:28.530> are<00:02:28.709> like

how big it is so some games are like

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.710 
how big it is so some games are like
over<00:02:29.160> 1<00:02:29.340> gigabyte<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:29.910> now<00:02:30.090> we'll<00:02:30.270> take<00:02:30.300> like

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
over 1 gigabyte and now we'll take like

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.860 
over 1 gigabyte and now we'll take like
10<00:02:30.990> minutes<00:02:31.340> usually<00:02:32.420> depending<00:02:33.420> on<00:02:33.510> how<00:02:33.630> fast

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
10 minutes usually depending on how fast

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.270 
10 minutes usually depending on how fast
computer<00:02:34.440> isn't<00:02:34.800> how<00:02:34.890> big<00:02:35.100> the<00:02:35.220> file<00:02:35.490> is<00:02:35.750> ok<00:02:37.280> ok

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
computer isn't how big the file is ok ok

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.150 
computer isn't how big the file is ok ok
so<00:02:38.700> once<00:02:38.910> it's<00:02:39.120> done<00:02:39.300> transferring<00:02:40.200> you<00:02:41.010> want

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
so once it's done transferring you want

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.180 
so once it's done transferring you want
to<00:02:41.250> open<00:02:41.550> up<00:02:41.640> I<00:02:41.820> so<00:02:42.120> and<00:02:42.560> I<00:02:43.560> already<00:02:43.739> have<00:02:44.010> some

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
to open up I so and I already have some

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.340 
to open up I so and I already have some
games<00:02:44.430> on<00:02:44.610> here<00:02:44.820> see<00:02:45.060> i<00:02:45.300> already<00:02:45.750> added<00:02:46.080> these

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
games on here see i already added these

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.340 
games on here see i already added these
games<00:02:46.910> the<00:02:47.910> one<00:02:48.060> I<00:02:48.090> just<00:02:48.180> added<00:02:48.630> was<00:02:48.930> this<00:02:49.140> one

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
games the one I just added was this one

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.630 
games the one I just added was this one
all<00:02:50.070> right<00:02:50.190> it<00:02:50.670> can<00:02:50.940> be<00:02:51.060> mine<00:02:51.750> I<00:02:51.989> put<00:02:52.410> CSO<00:02:53.040> on

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
all right it can be mine I put CSO on

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.850 
all right it can be mine I put CSO on
here<00:02:54.630> and<00:02:54.890> I<00:02:55.890> so<00:02:56.220> but<00:02:56.630> so<00:02:57.630> what's<00:02:57.780> ESO<00:02:58.260> is<00:02:58.530> is

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
here and I so but so what's ESO is is

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.850 
here and I so but so what's ESO is is
it's<00:02:59.130> just<00:02:59.550> a<00:02:59.760> compressed<00:03:00.420> version<00:03:01.110> of<00:03:01.290> I<00:03:01.620> so

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
it's just a compressed version of I so

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.580 
it's just a compressed version of I so
it<00:03:02.100> saves<00:03:02.850> up<00:03:03.090> a<00:03:03.150> lot<00:03:03.330> of<00:03:03.420> space<00:03:03.660> sometimes<00:03:04.230> and

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
it saves up a lot of space sometimes and

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.210 
it saves up a lot of space sometimes and
I<00:03:04.799> so<00:03:05.100> can<00:03:05.400> be<00:03:05.430> like<00:03:06.290> 1<00:03:07.290> get<00:03:07.530> 1<00:03:07.560> point<00:03:08.070> 3

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
I so can be like 1 get 1 point 3

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.370 
I so can be like 1 get 1 point 3
gigabytes<00:03:08.730> and<00:03:09.090> after<00:03:09.450> you<00:03:09.570> compress<00:03:10.080> it<00:03:10.290> into

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
gigabytes and after you compress it into

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.610 
gigabytes and after you compress it into
a<00:03:10.560> nice<00:03:10.769> meanness<00:03:11.459> ESO<00:03:11.880> sorry<00:03:12.690> then<00:03:13.290> it<00:03:13.470> will

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
a nice meanness ESO sorry then it will

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.820 
a nice meanness ESO sorry then it will
become<00:03:13.739> like<00:03:15.019> 800<00:03:16.019> megawatts<00:03:16.350> you<00:03:16.560> know<00:03:16.709> it

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
become like 800 megawatts you know it

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.759 
become like 800 megawatts you know it
cuts<00:03:17.040> out<00:03:17.220> a<00:03:17.280> lot<00:03:17.670> of<00:03:18.170> it<00:03:19.170> makes<00:03:19.440> a<00:03:19.590> lot<00:03:19.739> of

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
cuts out a lot of it makes a lot of

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.770 
cuts out a lot of it makes a lot of
space<00:03:20.130> all<00:03:20.760> right<00:03:20.910> you<00:03:20.970> can<00:03:21.030> put<00:03:21.299> more<00:03:21.480> games

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
space all right you can put more games

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.400 
space all right you can put more games
and<00:03:22.459> I<00:03:23.459> recommend<00:03:24.120> getting<00:03:24.239> a<00:03:24.480> bigger<00:03:24.750> using<00:03:25.320> a

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
and I recommend getting a bigger using a

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.520 
and I recommend getting a bigger using a
bigger<00:03:25.709> memory<00:03:26.040> card<00:03:26.489> because<00:03:27.200> so<00:03:28.200> that<00:03:28.380> way

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
bigger memory card because so that way

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.030 
bigger memory card because so that way
you<00:03:28.590> can<00:03:28.709> have<00:03:28.860> more<00:03:29.190> games<00:03:29.519> and<00:03:29.850> stuff<00:03:31.040> yeah

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
you can have more games and stuff yeah

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.120 
you can have more games and stuff yeah
alright<00:03:32.910> so<00:03:33.180> after<00:03:33.330> you<00:03:33.570> do<00:03:33.690> that<00:03:33.720> you<00:03:34.230> just

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
alright so after you do that you just

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.810 
alright so after you do that you just
want<00:03:35.519> to<00:03:35.610> exit<00:03:36.360> this<00:03:36.480> out<00:03:36.750> and<00:03:36.959> get<00:03:37.590> out<00:03:37.860> of<00:03:38.160> USB

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
want to exit this out and get out of USB

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.729 
want to exit this out and get out of USB
mode<00:03:39.000> so<00:03:39.239> expressed<00:03:39.690> circle<00:03:40.590> go<00:03:41.549> back<00:03:41.790> and<00:03:42.739> let

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
mode so expressed circle go back and let

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:47.180 
mode so expressed circle go back and let
me<00:03:43.830> show<00:03:44.100> you<00:03:44.480> what<00:03:45.480> access<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:45.959> game<00:03:46.190> alright

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
me show you what access the game alright

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
so you have use exited USB mode now you

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.900 
so you have use exited USB mode now you
want<00:03:50.760> to<00:03:50.820> go<00:03:50.970> into<00:03:51.299> game<00:03:51.720> all<00:03:52.650> right<00:03:52.799> and<00:03:53.700> go<00:03:53.850> to

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
want to go into game all right and go to

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.729 
want to go into game all right and go to
memory<00:03:54.390> stick<00:03:54.750> and<00:03:56.930> this<00:03:57.930> is<00:03:58.140> the<00:03:58.290> game<00:03:58.530> you

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
memory stick and this is the game you

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.180 
memory stick and this is the game you
just<00:03:59.070> added<00:03:59.459> you<00:04:00.239> see<00:04:00.420> that<00:04:01.160> scheme<00:04:02.160> just

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
just added you see that scheme just

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:08.900 
just added you see that scheme just
added<00:04:04.160> now<00:04:05.160> normally<00:04:05.459> you<00:04:06.000> would<00:04:06.180> have<00:04:06.209> to<00:04:07.910> you

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
would have to put in a UMD to play the

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.800 
would have to put in a UMD to play the
game

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810
