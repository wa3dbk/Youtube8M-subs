hey guys I'm Erin Edgar and today I'm

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.960 
hey guys I'm Erin Edgar and today I'm
going<00:00:01.800> to<00:00:01.860> talk<00:00:02.010> about<00:00:02.040> how<00:00:02.490> to<00:00:02.550> play<00:00:02.850> your

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
going to talk about how to play your

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.510 
going to talk about how to play your
cymbals<00:00:03.680> probably<00:00:04.680> more<00:00:04.830> appropriately<00:00:05.370> how

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
cymbals probably more appropriately how

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.110 
cymbals probably more appropriately how
not<00:00:05.819> to<00:00:06.150> play<00:00:06.509> your<00:00:06.720> cymbals<00:00:07.109> so<00:00:07.910> if<00:00:08.910> you<00:00:09.030> take

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
not to play your cymbals so if you take

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.150 
not to play your cymbals so if you take
a<00:00:09.179> look<00:00:09.330> at<00:00:09.420> the<00:00:09.480> symbol<00:00:09.690> right<00:00:09.780> here<00:00:10.019> I<00:00:10.200> have

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
a look at the symbol right here I have

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.480 
a look at the symbol right here I have
it<00:00:11.280> set<00:00:11.460> up<00:00:12.170> flat<00:00:13.170> note<00:00:13.860> about<00:00:14.040> an<00:00:14.160> eye<00:00:14.190> level

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
it set up flat note about an eye level

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.870 
it set up flat note about an eye level
so<00:00:15.330> if<00:00:15.389> I<00:00:15.480> was<00:00:15.630> to<00:00:15.719> hit<00:00:15.839> this<00:00:16.020> thing<00:00:16.670> I'd<00:00:17.670> be

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
so if I was to hit this thing I'd be

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.970 
so if I was to hit this thing I'd be
going<00:00:18.119> right<00:00:18.300> into<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.600> edge<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:19.080> putting<00:00:19.920> a

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
going right into the edge and putting a

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.010 
going right into the edge and putting a
lot<00:00:20.189> of<00:00:20.220> impact<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:20.970> strain<00:00:21.449> on<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.779> edge<00:00:21.900> of

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
lot of impact and strain on the edge of

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.599 
lot of impact and strain on the edge of
that<00:00:22.199> not<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.500> mention<00:00:22.650> hacking<00:00:23.130> up<00:00:23.220> my<00:00:23.369> sticks

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:25.609 
that not to mention hacking up my sticks

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:27.589 
that not to mention hacking up my sticks
one<00:00:26.609> of<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.789> things<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.090> consider<00:00:27.390> when

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
one of the things to consider when

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:28.990 
one of the things to consider when
you're<00:00:27.779> hitting<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.140> cymbal<00:00:28.439> is<00:00:28.590> that<00:00:28.769> you

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
you're hitting a cymbal is that you

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.339 
you're hitting a cymbal is that you
pretty<00:00:30.000> much<00:00:30.119> want<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.480> exact<00:00:30.810> opposite<00:00:31.260> of

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
pretty much want the exact opposite of

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.930 
pretty much want the exact opposite of
that<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:31.650> want<00:00:31.920> your<00:00:32.160> energy<00:00:32.460> going<00:00:32.669> across

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
that you want your energy going across

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.389 
that you want your energy going across
the<00:00:33.239> cymbal<00:00:33.600> not<00:00:33.989> into<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:34.380> so<00:00:35.010> instead<00:00:35.160> of<00:00:35.250> it

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
the cymbal not into it so instead of it

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.310 
the cymbal not into it so instead of it
being<00:00:35.430> like<00:00:35.610> this<00:00:35.969> you're<00:00:36.930> going<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.110> want<00:00:37.260> it

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
being like this you're going to want it

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.520 
being like this you're going to want it
to<00:00:37.410> be<00:00:37.530> this<00:00:38.239> sorry<00:00:39.239> now<00:00:39.750> this<00:00:39.930> angle<00:00:40.140> although

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
to be this sorry now this angle although

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.549 
to be this sorry now this angle although
looking<00:00:41.160> very<00:00:41.399> cool<00:00:41.730> is<00:00:42.140> hard<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.290> do<00:00:43.410> that

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
looking very cool is hard to do that

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.350 
looking very cool is hard to do that
with<00:00:43.770> so<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.399> first<00:00:44.610> thing<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:44.969> we're<00:00:45.270> going

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
with so the first thing that we're going

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.639 
with so the first thing that we're going
to<00:00:45.420> try<00:00:45.690> is<00:00:45.750> we're<00:00:46.079> going<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.230> angle<00:00:46.590> the

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
to try is we're going to angle the

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.950 
to try is we're going to angle the
cymbal<00:00:46.920> towards<00:00:47.250> us<00:00:50.300> so<00:00:51.300> now<00:00:51.420> with<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.690> cymbal

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
cymbal towards us so now with the cymbal

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.560 
cymbal towards us so now with the cymbal
angle<00:00:52.230> towards<00:00:52.680> us<00:00:53.000> even<00:00:54.000> if<00:00:54.090> we<00:00:54.210> did<00:00:54.360> hit

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
angle towards us even if we did hit

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.290 
angle towards us even if we did hit
straight<00:00:54.930> in<00:00:55.370> sure<00:00:56.370> it's<00:00:56.550> still<00:00:56.820> not<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.149> best

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
straight in sure it's still not the best

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.500 
straight in sure it's still not the best
but<00:00:58.199> it's<00:00:58.710> not<00:00:59.190> nearly<00:00:59.460> as<00:00:59.640> bad<00:01:00.059> as<00:01:00.090> hacking

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
but it's not nearly as bad as hacking

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.729 
but it's not nearly as bad as hacking
right<00:01:00.840> at<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.079> edge<00:01:02.329> so<00:01:03.329> from<00:01:03.690> here<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.199> swipe

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
right at the edge so from here to swipe

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.850 
right at the edge so from here to swipe
no<00:01:05.580> problem<00:01:06.060> we're<00:01:06.780> at<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:06.900> much<00:01:07.110> better<00:01:07.320> angle

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
no problem we're at a much better angle

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.100 
no problem we're at a much better angle
we're<00:01:08.040> at<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.790> similar<00:01:09.180> angle<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.810> symbol

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
we're at a similar angle to the symbol

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.140

lot<00:01:12.390> less<00:01:12.600> strain<00:01:12.990> on<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.409> cymbal<00:01:14.509> now<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:16.140> may

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
lot less strain on the cymbal now it may

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.840 
lot less strain on the cymbal now it may
feel<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.619> little<00:01:16.710> awkward<00:01:17.100> at<00:01:17.400> first<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.759> do

it down a bit now the cool thing about

it down a bit now the cool thing about
the<00:01:51.060> symbol<00:01:51.329> being<00:01:51.450> lower<00:01:51.689> is<00:01:52.020> we<00:01:52.229> can<00:01:52.350> angle

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
the symbol being lower is we can angle

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.020 
the symbol being lower is we can angle
it<00:01:52.679> back<00:01:52.860> again<00:01:53.329> because<00:01:54.329> again<00:01:54.539> we<00:01:55.200> want<00:01:55.439> our

it's<00:02:22.890> a<00:02:23.040> cool<00:02:23.310> thing<00:02:23.640> that<00:02:24.000> you<00:02:24.840> can<00:02:25.140> angle

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
it's a cool thing that you can angle

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.340 
it's a cool thing that you can angle
them<00:02:25.680> but<00:02:26.040> almost<00:02:26.280> kind<00:02:26.490> of<00:02:26.580> inwards<00:02:27.350> might

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
them but almost kind of inwards might

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.170 
them but almost kind of inwards might
look<00:02:28.530> a<00:02:28.680> little<00:02:28.710> weird<00:02:28.950> but<00:02:29.460> it's<00:02:29.580> make<00:02:29.910> it<00:02:29.940> so

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
look a little weird but it's make it so

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.940 
look a little weird but it's make it so
you<00:02:30.240> have<00:02:30.450> set<00:02:30.690> your<00:02:30.780> left<00:02:31.140> hand<00:02:31.380> crash<00:02:31.650> and

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
you have set your left hand crash and

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.910 
you have set your left hand crash and
your<00:02:32.040> right<00:02:32.250> hand<00:02:32.520> crash<00:02:32.820> but<00:02:33.690> with<00:02:33.840> this<00:02:34.080> even

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
your right hand crash but with this even

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.220 
your right hand crash but with this even
if<00:02:35.010> I<00:02:35.130> do<00:02:35.190> hack<00:02:35.940> straight<00:02:36.330> the<00:02:36.510> cymbal<00:02:36.870> like<00:02:37.050> it

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
if I do hack straight the cymbal like it

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:58.410 
if I do hack straight the cymbal like it
would<00:02:37.500> it's<00:02:38.010> going<00:02:38.220> to<00:02:38.280> glance<00:02:38.940> right

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.580 

so<00:02:59.420> to<00:02:59.480> get<00:02:59.629> used<00:02:59.780> to<00:02:59.900> this<00:02:59.989> stuff<00:03:00.230> I<00:03:00.379> would

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
so to get used to this stuff I would

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.589 
so to get used to this stuff I would
suggest<00:03:00.739> trying<00:03:01.220> these<00:03:01.670> kind<00:03:02.060> of<00:03:02.120> things<00:03:02.390> out

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:02.599 
suggest trying these kind of things out

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:04.300 
suggest trying these kind of things out
in<00:03:02.840> the<00:03:03.080> practice<00:03:03.500> room<00:03:03.680> to<00:03:03.799> make<00:03:03.950> sure<00:03:04.099> you're

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
in the practice room to make sure you're

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.979 
in the practice room to make sure you're
angling<00:03:04.790> your<00:03:04.970> symbols<00:03:05.420> in<00:03:05.540> a<00:03:05.599> way<00:03:05.750> that

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
angling your symbols in a way that

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:08.229 
angling your symbols in a way that
you're<00:03:06.110> not<00:03:06.349> hitting<00:03:07.159> directly<00:03:07.610> into<00:03:08.090> them

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
you're not hitting directly into them

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:09.550 
you're not hitting directly into them
because<00:03:08.480> that's<00:03:08.660> just<00:03:08.840> going<00:03:09.019> to<00:03:09.080> crack<00:03:09.379> them

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
because that's just going to crack them

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.199 
because that's just going to crack them
right<00:03:09.709> at<00:03:09.799> the<00:03:09.890> edge<00:03:10.040> and<00:03:10.340> for<00:03:10.910> most<00:03:11.030> guys

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
right at the edge and for most guys

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:12.460 
right at the edge and for most guys
especially<00:03:11.569> ones<00:03:11.930> that<00:03:11.989> are<00:03:12.140> paying<00:03:12.379> for

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
especially ones that are paying for

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.949 
especially ones that are paying for
their<00:03:12.680> symbols<00:03:13.069> that's<00:03:13.970> a<00:03:14.180> that's<00:03:14.569> a<00:03:14.720> hefty

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
their symbols that's a that's a hefty

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.869 
their symbols that's a that's a hefty
thing<00:03:15.440> to<00:03:15.620> have<00:03:15.769> to<00:03:15.799> replace<00:03:16.220> all<00:03:16.459> the<00:03:16.549> time<00:03:16.730> if

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:16.879 
thing to have to replace all the time if

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:19.329 
thing to have to replace all the time if
you're<00:03:16.970> breaking
