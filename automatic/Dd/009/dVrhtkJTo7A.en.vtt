depersonalization of love as children we

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.350 
depersonalization of love as children we
give<00:01:37.170> cards<00:01:37.590> every<00:01:38.070> virus<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.579> our<00:01:38.700> friends

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.559 
the moon is forming a harmonious sextile
with<00:02:07.290> Mars<00:02:07.560> which<00:02:08.160> I<00:02:08.310> think<00:02:08.550> actually<00:02:08.759> smooths

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
with Mars which I think actually smooths

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.950 
with Mars which I think actually smooths
out<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.899> energy<00:02:10.259> I<00:02:10.830> think<00:02:11.310> that<00:02:11.550> that<00:02:11.790> that<00:02:12.750> we

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
out the energy I think that that that we

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.990 
out the energy I think that that that we
can<00:02:13.080> have<00:02:13.230> some<00:02:13.440> stress<00:02:13.770> going<00:02:14.100> into<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:14.580> but

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
can have some stress going into it but

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.420 
can have some stress going into it but
by<00:02:15.240> evening<00:02:15.270> I<00:02:16.080> think<00:02:16.410> things<00:02:16.710> should<00:02:16.830> be<00:02:17.040> okay

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
by evening I think things should be okay

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.010 
by evening I think things should be okay
I<00:02:17.460> think<00:02:17.640> this<00:02:17.850> is<00:02:18.030> a<00:02:18.060> good<00:02:18.270> day<00:02:18.480> I<00:02:18.510> think<00:02:18.840> I

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
I think this is a good day I think I

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.480 
I think this is a good day I think I
think<00:02:19.350> you'll<00:02:19.500> get<00:02:19.680> what<00:02:19.860> you<00:02:19.980> want<00:02:20.190> whatever

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
think you'll get what you want whatever

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.700 
think you'll get what you want whatever
that<00:02:20.850> I<00:02:20.900> think<00:02:21.900> your<00:02:22.050> point<00:02:22.230> that<00:02:22.380> you<00:02:22.560> make

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
that I think your point that you make

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.520 
that I think your point that you make
about<00:02:22.860> Mars<00:02:23.280> is<00:02:23.550> is<00:02:23.910> a<00:02:23.970> good<00:02:24.330> point<00:02:24.630> anytime

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
about Mars is is a good point anytime

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.410 
about Mars is is a good point anytime
planets<00:02:26.040> are<00:02:26.190> supportive<00:02:26.730> to<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.030> Sun<00:02:27.240> and

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
planets are supportive to the Sun and

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.170 
planets are supportive to the Sun and
Moon<00:02:27.570> and<00:02:27.810> a<00:02:27.900> full<00:02:28.140> moon<00:02:28.380> it<00:02:29.150> stabilizes<00:02:30.150> the

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
Moon and a full moon it stabilizes the

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.100 
Moon and a full moon it stabilizes the
situation<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.080> Mars<00:02:31.440> although<00:02:31.860> it<00:02:32.730> is<00:02:33.110> not

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
situation and Mars although it is not

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.740 
situation and Mars although it is not
quite<00:02:34.530> moving<00:02:34.980> backwards<00:02:35.610> yet<00:02:35.850> yeah<00:02:36.210> mark<00:02:36.570> it

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
quite moving backwards yet yeah mark it

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.090 
quite moving backwards yet yeah mark it
won't<00:02:36.960> it's<00:02:37.140> thinking<00:02:37.530> it's<00:02:37.710> a<00:02:37.800> couple<00:02:38.040> of

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
won't it's thinking it's a couple of

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.670 
won't it's thinking it's a couple of
weeks<00:02:38.250> away<00:02:38.460> but<00:02:39.180> Mars<00:02:39.450> is<00:02:39.570> in<00:02:40.020> Libra<00:02:40.380> which<00:02:40.530> is

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
weeks away but Mars is in Libra which is

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.830 
weeks away but Mars is in Libra which is
a<00:02:40.710> sign<00:02:41.010> of<00:02:41.070> fairness<00:02:41.520> so<00:02:41.880> there's<00:02:42.120> a<00:02:42.180> kind<00:02:42.630> of

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
a sign of fairness so there's a kind of

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.380 
a sign of fairness so there's a kind of
mutuality<00:02:43.440> of<00:02:43.920> giving<00:02:44.400> and<00:02:44.490> receiving<00:02:44.610> that<00:02:45.360> I

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
mutuality of giving and receiving that I

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.350 
mutuality of giving and receiving that I
think<00:02:45.870> makes<00:02:46.590> this<00:02:46.830> a<00:02:46.890> more<00:02:47.160> egalitarian<00:02:47.360> but

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
think makes this a more egalitarian but

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.620 
think makes this a more egalitarian but
in<00:02:48.630> other<00:02:48.900> ways<00:02:49.470> I<00:02:49.890> think<00:02:50.010> a<00:02:50.580> new<00:02:51.180> different

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
in other ways I think a new different

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.830 
in other ways I think a new different
and<00:02:52.080> fairer<00:02:52.500> kind<00:02:53.040> of<00:02:53.370> holiday<00:02:53.820> I<00:02:54.120> think<00:02:54.480> one

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
and fairer kind of holiday I think one

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.660 
and fairer kind of holiday I think one
other<00:02:55.020> piece<00:02:55.320> plays<00:02:55.710> into<00:02:56.070> this<00:02:56.190> and<00:02:56.400> that<00:02:56.520> is

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
other piece plays into this and that is

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.490 
other piece plays into this and that is
by<00:02:56.850> later<00:02:57.120> in<00:02:57.330> the<00:02:57.360> evening<00:02:57.600> the<00:02:58.020> moon<00:02:58.200> is

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
by later in the evening the moon is

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.310 
by later in the evening the moon is
opposing<00:02:59.040> mercury<00:02:59.790> and<00:03:00.030> so<00:03:00.480> I<00:03:00.510> think<00:03:00.630> even<00:03:01.020> our

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
opposing mercury and so I think even our

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.990 
opposing mercury and so I think even our
good<00:03:01.530> intentions<00:03:01.560> and<00:03:02.280> even<00:03:02.520> the<00:03:02.670> smoothness

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
good intentions and even the smoothness

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.660 
good intentions and even the smoothness
of<00:03:03.180> getting<00:03:03.810> what<00:03:03.960> we<00:03:04.080> want<00:03:04.320> so<00:03:04.530> to<00:03:04.590> speak<00:03:04.890> as

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
of getting what we want so to speak as

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.690 
of getting what we want so to speak as
the<00:03:06.000> Sun<00:03:06.210> shines<00:03:06.540> Mars<00:03:06.900> that<00:03:07.320> moon<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:08.100> moon

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
the Sun shines Mars that moon the moon

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.900 
the Sun shines Mars that moon the moon
in<00:03:08.910> opposition<00:03:09.570> to<00:03:09.600> mercury<00:03:10.110> might<00:03:10.590> mean<00:03:10.860> that

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
in opposition to mercury might mean that

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.070 
in opposition to mercury might mean that
communication<00:03:11.910> gets<00:03:12.150> muddled<00:03:12.420> we<00:03:12.720> may<00:03:12.900> take

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
communication gets muddled we may take

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.860 
communication gets muddled we may take
something<00:03:13.500> too<00:03:13.650> far<00:03:13.950> we<00:03:14.520> may<00:03:14.550> end<00:03:14.940> up<00:03:15.210> having

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
something too far we may end up having

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.450 
something too far we may end up having
to<00:03:15.990> work<00:03:16.020> through<00:03:16.530> something<00:03:16.980> verbally

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 
to work through something verbally

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:19.640 
to work through something verbally
that's<00:03:17.700> not<00:03:17.940> easy<00:03:18.180> well<00:03:18.900> let's<00:03:19.380> make<00:03:19.620> sure

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650
