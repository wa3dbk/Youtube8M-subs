00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
test for us it's just about that

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.060 
test for us it's just about that
consistency<00:00:24.930> you<00:00:25.199> know<00:00:25.350> we<00:00:25.590> win<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:25.920> play

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
consistency out but no we're taking the

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.749 
consistency out but no we're taking the
positives<00:00:31.380> out<00:00:31.529> of<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:31.800> you<00:00:31.890> know<00:00:31.920> we<00:00:32.489> wanted

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:33.920 
positives out of it you know we wanted
to<00:00:32.790> test<00:00:33.030> like<00:00:33.180> that<00:00:33.329> going<00:00:33.510> into<00:00:33.690> the

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
to test like that going into the

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.630 
to test like that going into the
tournament<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.559> all<00:00:35.130> that<00:00:35.250> matters<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.610> us

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
tournament and all that matters to us

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.310 
tournament and all that matters to us
now<00:00:35.910> is<00:00:36.090> that<00:00:36.239> you<00:00:36.390> know<00:00:36.510> we<00:00:36.780> start<00:00:37.020> that<00:00:37.140> first

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
now is that you know we start that first

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.889 
now is that you know we start that first
game<00:00:37.590> on<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.800> high<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.910> while<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.270> positives

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
game on a high and while the positives

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.630 
game on a high and while the positives
you<00:00:40.020> can<00:00:40.140> take<00:00:40.320> from<00:00:40.440> tonight's<00:00:40.770> game<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:41.160> think

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
you can take from tonight's game I think

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.979 
you can take from tonight's game I think
you<00:00:41.700> know<00:00:41.790> some<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.180> parts<00:00:42.450> in<00:00:42.570> play<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:42.930> I

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
you know some of the parts in play and I

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.840 
you know some of the parts in play and I
found<00:00:43.170> offered<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.710> one<00:00:43.860> touch<00:00:44.100> pass<00:00:44.370> in<00:00:44.670> and

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
found offered the one touch pass in and

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.160 
found offered the one touch pass in and
obviously<00:00:45.090> getting<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.570> go<00:00:45.719> against<00:00:46.020> the

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
obviously getting that go against the

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.810 
obviously getting that go against the
run<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.440> play<00:00:46.469> you<00:00:47.039> know<00:00:47.129> their<00:00:47.340> positives<00:00:47.760> to

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
run of play you know their positives to

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.369 
run of play you know their positives to
look<00:00:48.030> at<00:00:48.180> but<00:00:48.360> for<00:00:48.570> us<00:00:48.660> it's<00:00:48.870> about<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.260> know
