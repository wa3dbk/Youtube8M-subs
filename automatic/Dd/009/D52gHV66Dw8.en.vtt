and it's hooked up with this little
electrical<00:00:58.340> circuit<00:00:58.760> and<00:01:00.670> then<00:01:01.690> this<00:01:04.360> bolt

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
electrical circuit and then this bolt

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.290 
electrical circuit and then this bolt
right<00:01:05.600> there<00:01:05.659> that's<00:01:06.020> a<00:01:06.200> 10<00:01:06.439> millimeter<00:01:06.799> bolt

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.530 
right there that's a 10 millimeter bolt
now<00:01:08.300> it's<00:01:08.420> a<00:01:08.510> little<00:01:08.600> hard<00:01:08.900> to<00:01:09.020> get<00:01:09.200> to<00:01:09.940> so<00:01:10.940> you

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
now it's a little hard to get to so you

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.240 
now it's a little hard to get to so you
kind<00:01:11.810> of<00:01:11.870> use<00:01:12.050> this<00:01:12.200> I<00:01:12.350> loosen<00:01:12.740> it<00:01:12.830> up<00:01:12.920> a<00:01:13.070> bit

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
kind of use this I loosen it up a bit

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.430 
kind of use this I loosen it up a bit
before<00:01:13.430> I<00:01:13.700> did<00:01:13.850> this<00:01:13.940> video<00:01:14.120> but<00:01:14.540> I<00:01:14.810> got<00:01:15.200> big

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
before I did this video but I got big

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.680 
before I did this video but I got big
hands<00:01:15.710> too<00:01:16.040> so<00:01:16.280> it's<00:01:16.909> kind<00:01:17.090> of<00:01:17.120> hard<00:01:17.330> to<00:01:17.360> get<00:01:17.540> to

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
hands too so it's kind of hard to get to

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.770 
hands too so it's kind of hard to get to
but<00:01:17.720> if<00:01:18.350> you<00:01:18.470> got<00:01:18.620> so<00:01:18.740> much<00:01:18.860> smaller<00:01:19.630> but<00:01:20.630> who

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
but if you got so much smaller but who

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.630

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
you could get them to help you up but

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.700 
you could get them to help you up but
you<00:01:22.729> need<00:01:22.940> this<00:01:23.090> extender<00:01:23.750> and<00:01:23.930> if<00:01:24.409> you<00:01:24.530> also

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
you need this extender and if you also

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.930 
you need this extender and if you also
have<00:01:24.920> a<00:01:25.659> ratchet<00:01:26.659> you<00:01:26.810> can<00:01:26.930> probably<00:01:27.170> just<00:01:27.940> use

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
have a ratchet you can probably just use

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.230 
have a ratchet you can probably just use
that<00:01:29.210> to<00:01:29.450> to<00:01:29.600> kind<00:01:29.750> of<00:01:29.810> squeeze<00:01:30.140> in<00:01:30.440> there<00:01:31.240> but

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
that to to kind of squeeze in there but

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:40.780 
that to to kind of squeeze in there but
for<00:01:32.450> me<00:01:33.190> my<00:01:34.190> hand<00:01:34.900> just<00:01:35.979> unscrew<00:01:36.979> it<00:01:39.640> if<00:01:40.640> you

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790

smaller<00:01:42.350> hands<00:01:42.680> I<00:01:42.799> might<00:01:42.950> be<00:01:43.040> able<00:01:43.130> to<00:01:43.190> get<00:01:43.369> in

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
smaller hands I might be able to get in

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.550 
smaller hands I might be able to get in
there<00:01:43.610> a<00:01:43.640> little<00:01:43.700> better<00:01:44.140> when<00:01:45.140> I<00:01:45.170> want<00:01:45.350> to<00:01:45.380> ask

them to do it when I enter a little big

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.780 
them to do it when I enter a little big
but<00:01:49.060> still<00:01:50.060> get<00:01:50.240> it<00:01:50.360> turn<00:01:50.900> it<00:01:51.640> hopefully<00:01:52.640> you

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
but still get it turn it hopefully you

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.810 
but still get it turn it hopefully you
listen<00:01:53.060> up<00:01:53.180> before<00:01:53.420> you<00:01:53.510> drop<00:01:53.720> it

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.660 

and<00:01:58.820> it<00:01:58.909> also<00:01:59.060> has<00:01:59.420> a<00:01:59.450> little<00:01:59.810> locking<00:02:00.079> pin

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
right in that back there kind of folded

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.760 
right in that back there kind of folded
in<00:02:03.320> that<00:02:03.470> hole<00:02:04.119> right<00:02:05.119> back<00:02:05.360> here<00:02:05.810> so<00:02:06.740> that

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
in that hole right back here so that

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.620 
in that hole right back here so that
goes<00:02:07.009> in<00:02:07.040> the<00:02:07.220> hole<00:02:07.369> and<00:02:08.060> this<00:02:08.209> goes<00:02:08.390> in<00:02:08.599> the

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
goes in the hole and this goes in the

corrosion<00:04:09.229> or<00:04:09.590> anything<00:04:10.180> so<00:04:11.180> the<00:04:11.389> only<00:04:11.510> thing

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
corrosion or anything so the only thing

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:14.379 
corrosion or anything so the only thing
I<00:04:11.780> can<00:04:11.930> assume<00:04:12.549> is<00:04:13.549> that<00:04:13.790> the<00:04:13.910> horn<00:04:14.090> has<00:04:14.209> just

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:14.389 
I can assume is that the horn has just

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:16.150 
I can assume is that the horn has just
burned<00:04:14.570> out<00:04:14.750> and<00:04:15.440> I<00:04:15.530> heard<00:04:15.709> on<00:04:15.859> these<00:04:15.979> models

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
burned out and I heard on these models

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.650 
burned out and I heard on these models
this<00:04:16.400> happens<00:04:16.820> quite<00:04:17.030> a<00:04:17.090> bit<00:04:17.180> because<00:04:17.389> the<00:04:17.540> way

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
this happens quite a bit because the way

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.270 
this happens quite a bit because the way
they're<00:04:17.870> shaped<00:04:18.139> water<00:04:18.590> can<00:04:18.829> get<00:04:18.949> in<00:04:19.070> there

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
they're shaped water can get in there

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.570 
they're shaped water can get in there
and<00:04:19.690> just<00:04:20.690> mess<00:04:20.900> it<00:04:20.930> up<00:04:21.199> however<00:04:21.799> it<00:04:22.130> happens

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
and just mess it up however it happens

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.490 
and just mess it up however it happens
or<00:04:22.760> cause<00:04:23.300> some<00:04:23.540> rust<00:04:23.780> on<00:04:23.930> the<00:04:24.050> back<00:04:24.229> of<00:04:24.410> the

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
or cause some rust on the back of the

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.409 
or cause some rust on the back of the
metal<00:04:24.949> part<00:04:25.190> of<00:04:25.220> the<00:04:25.310> horn<00:04:25.520> so<00:04:25.729> just<00:04:26.270> get

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
metal part of the horn so just get

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:28.810 
metal part of the horn so just get
another<00:04:26.600> horn<00:04:26.870> hook<00:04:27.350> back<00:04:27.590> up<00:04:27.800> and<00:04:28.040> you<00:04:28.639> are

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
another horn hook back up and you are

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.540 
another horn hook back up and you are
good<00:04:29.090> to<00:04:29.240> go<00:04:29.270> so<00:04:29.600> that<00:04:29.900> in<00:04:30.830> a<00:04:30.949> nutshell<00:04:30.979> is

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
good to go so that in a nutshell is

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:34.650 
good to go so that in a nutshell is
where<00:04:32.090> your<00:04:32.240> horn<00:04:32.449> is<00:04:32.660> on<00:04:32.840> the<00:04:33.320> Ford<00:04:33.590> Focus

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
where your horn is on the Ford Focus

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.409 
where your horn is on the Ford Focus
that's<00:04:35.660> it

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419 
that's it

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:44.260 
that's it
underneath<00:04:38.419> the<00:04:38.690> car<00:04:40.600> underneath<00:04:43.270> right

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
underneath the car underneath right

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.340 
underneath the car underneath right
there<00:04:44.570> I<00:04:46.210> would<00:04:47.210> recommend<00:04:47.600> also<00:04:47.750> lifting<00:04:48.259> a

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
there I would recommend also lifting a

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.260 
there I would recommend also lifting a
car<00:04:48.590> up<00:04:48.830> a<00:04:48.949> little<00:04:49.190> bit<00:04:49.370> to<00:04:49.729> get<00:04:49.880> under<00:04:50.090> there

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
car up a little bit to get under there

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:51.760 
car up a little bit to get under there
makes<00:04:50.509> it<00:04:50.600> a<00:04:50.690> little<00:04:50.780> easier<00:04:51.290> but<00:04:51.470> it's<00:04:51.620> not

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
makes it a little easier but it's not

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.970 
makes it a little easier but it's not
necessary<00:04:52.250> if<00:04:52.340> you're<00:04:52.460> small<00:04:52.699> enough
