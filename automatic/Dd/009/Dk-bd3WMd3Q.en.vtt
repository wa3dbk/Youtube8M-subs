00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:02.840 
hey guys in the last video I showed you

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.710 
hey guys in the last video I showed you
guys<00:00:03.460> kind<00:00:04.460> of<00:00:04.490> an<00:00:04.610> idea<00:00:04.850> I<00:00:04.910> had<00:00:05.180> about<00:00:05.420> getting

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:05.720 
guys kind of an idea I had about getting

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.529 
guys kind of an idea I had about getting
the<00:00:05.990> charge<00:00:06.740> controller<00:00:07.040> off<00:00:07.370> the<00:00:07.879> battery

00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:08.539 
the charge controller off the battery

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:14.350 
the charge controller off the battery
for<00:00:08.869> the<00:00:08.959> HP<00:00:10.539> p400<00:00:12.459> so<00:00:13.459> I<00:00:13.699> actually<00:00:13.969> went<00:00:14.239> ahead

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:14.360 
for the HP p400 so I actually went ahead

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.180 
for the HP p400 so I actually went ahead
and<00:00:14.719> I<00:00:14.779> made<00:00:15.049> it<00:00:15.169> after<00:00:15.349> I<00:00:15.559> got<00:00:15.619> my<00:00:15.769> batteries

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:16.190 
and I made it after I got my batteries

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:19.240 
and I made it after I got my batteries
in<00:00:16.309> the<00:00:16.400> mail<00:00:16.580> as<00:00:17.359> you<00:00:17.630> can<00:00:17.779> see<00:00:17.960> here<00:00:18.259> I've<00:00:18.949> got

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.250 
in the mail as you can see here I've got

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:25.499 
in the mail as you can see here I've got
a<00:00:20.619> 4.8<00:00:21.619> volt<00:00:21.949> I<00:00:22.009> think<00:00:22.250> it's<00:00:22.400> 18<00:00:23.179> year<00:00:23.599> 1900

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:25.509 
a 4.8 volt I think it's 18 year 1900

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:30.339 
a 4.8 volt I think it's 18 year 1900
1900<00:00:26.980> milliamp<00:00:27.980> hours<00:00:28.810> solder<00:00:29.810> it<00:00:29.960> right<00:00:30.140> on

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:30.349 
1900 milliamp hours solder it right on

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.209 
1900 milliamp hours solder it right on
the<00:00:31.279> charge<00:00:31.939> controller<00:00:32.800> can't<00:00:33.800> really<00:00:34.010> focus

00:00:34.209 --> 00:00:34.219 
the charge controller can't really focus

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:35.889 
the charge controller can't really focus
here<00:00:34.670> I'm<00:00:34.760> in<00:00:34.850> the<00:00:34.940> basement<00:00:35.360> so<00:00:35.510> the<00:00:35.600> lights<00:00:35.809> a

00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:35.899 
here I'm in the basement so the lights a

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:39.970 
here I'm in the basement so the lights a
little<00:00:35.989> crummy<00:00:36.350> again<00:00:36.649> and<00:00:38.829> it<00:00:39.829> actually

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
little crummy again and it actually

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.950 
little crummy again and it actually
works<00:00:40.309> I<00:00:40.520> had<00:00:40.640> it<00:00:40.789> I<00:00:40.910> did<00:00:41.090> have<00:00:41.239> this<00:00:41.449> hooked<00:00:41.840> up

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
works I had it I did have this hooked up

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.220 
works I had it I did have this hooked up
to<00:00:42.199> the<00:00:42.350> RAID<00:00:43.070> controller<00:00:43.120> this<00:00:44.120> is<00:00:44.180> a<00:00:44.390> fully

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
to the RAID controller this is a fully

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.810 
to the RAID controller this is a fully
charged<00:00:45.530> it's<00:00:46.039> actually<00:00:46.340> working<00:00:46.519> pretty

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
charged it's actually working pretty

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.869 
charged it's actually working pretty
good<00:00:47.050> the<00:00:48.050> controller<00:00:48.379> reports<00:00:48.739> no<00:00:48.890> yes<00:00:49.100> so

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
good the controller reports no yes so

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:55.509 
good the controller reports no yes so
all<00:00:50.539> I<00:00:50.629> used<00:00:51.019> again<00:00:51.320> was<00:00:52.899> the<00:00:53.980> bad<00:00:54.980> battery<00:00:55.399> I

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:55.519 
all I used again was the bad battery I

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:00.310 
all I used again was the bad battery I
removed<00:00:56.510> the<00:00:56.829> charge<00:00:57.829> controller<00:00:59.170> it<00:01:00.170> was

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
removed the charge controller it was

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.130 
removed the charge controller it was
real<00:01:00.500> simple<00:01:00.679> just<00:01:00.920> push<00:01:01.309> back<00:01:01.489> the<00:01:01.640> club<00:01:01.820> and

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
real simple just push back the club and

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.460 
real simple just push back the club and
I<00:01:03.370> pulled<00:01:04.370> it<00:01:04.460> out<00:01:04.550> helps<00:01:05.240> if<00:01:05.330> I<00:01:05.420> actually<00:01:05.570> pull

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
I pulled it out helps if I actually pull

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.660 
I pulled it out helps if I actually pull
on<00:01:06.590> the<00:01:06.710> chip<00:01:06.890> I<00:01:07.040> guess<00:01:08.980> it's<00:01:09.980> one-handed<00:01:10.580> I

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
on the chip I guess it's one-handed I

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:17.250 
on the chip I guess it's one-handed I
guess<00:01:13.630> so<00:01:14.630> you<00:01:15.590> get<00:01:15.710> positive<00:01:16.130> and<00:01:16.490> negative

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:17.260 
guess so you get positive and negative

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.080 
guess so you get positive and negative
get<00:01:18.260> yourself<00:01:18.560> a<00:01:18.590> 4.8<00:01:19.130> volt<00:01:19.340> battery<00:01:19.670> and<00:01:19.850> you

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
get yourself a 4.8 volt battery and you

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.420 
get yourself a 4.8 volt battery and you
can<00:01:20.210> actually<00:01:20.360> get<00:01:20.570> a<00:01:20.660> bigger<00:01:21.020> one<00:01:21.250> 1900<00:01:22.250> I

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
can actually get a bigger one 1900 I

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.090 
can actually get a bigger one 1900 I
worked<00:01:23.120> out<00:01:23.240> the<00:01:23.360> math<00:01:23.510> on<00:01:23.750> this<00:01:23.930> this<00:01:24.170> is<00:01:24.380> to

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
worked out the math on this this is to

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.130 
worked out the math on this this is to
both<00:01:25.250> the<00:01:25.370> same<00:01:25.580> so<00:01:26.570> this<00:01:26.780> is<00:01:26.900> actually<00:01:27.110> a

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
both the same so this is actually a

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.750 
both the same so this is actually a
little<00:01:28.780> just<00:01:29.780> a<00:01:29.810> little<00:01:29.930> bit<00:01:30.050> more<00:01:30.170> powerful

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
little just a little bit more powerful

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.330 
little just a little bit more powerful
so<00:01:31.760> cut<00:01:32.240> the<00:01:32.360> leads<00:01:32.600> not<00:01:33.470> at<00:01:33.770> the<00:01:33.890> same<00:01:34.070> time

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
so cut the leads not at the same time

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.910 
so cut the leads not at the same time
because<00:01:34.550> you<00:01:34.700> might<00:01:34.730> short<00:01:35.180> them<00:01:35.300> out<00:01:35.420> and<00:01:35.920> a

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
because you might short them out and a

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.190 
because you might short them out and a
lot<00:01:37.370> of<00:01:37.400> them<00:01:37.580> straight<00:01:37.730> on<00:01:37.820> the<00:01:37.880> board<00:01:38.090> I<00:01:38.270> put

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
lot of them straight on the board I put

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.770 
lot of them straight on the board I put
a<00:01:39.230> little<00:01:39.380> bit<00:01:39.620> of<00:01:40.150> heat<00:01:41.150> shrink<00:01:41.180> on<00:01:41.570> there

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
a little bit of heat shrink on there

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.680 
a little bit of heat shrink on there
just<00:01:42.050> to<00:01:42.200> cover<00:01:42.770> up<00:01:43.010> the<00:01:43.670> other<00:01:43.850> side<00:01:44.090> it's<00:01:44.450> not

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
just to cover up the other side it's not

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.660 
just to cover up the other side it's not
covered<00:01:45.050> because<00:01:45.260> the<00:01:45.410> yeah<00:01:45.670> actual

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
covered because the yeah actual

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.420 
covered because the yeah actual
terminals<00:01:47.090> are<00:01:47.210> quite<00:01:47.450> large<00:01:47.720> so<00:01:48.410> maybe<00:01:49.310> a

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
terminals are quite large so maybe a

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.150 
terminals are quite large so maybe a
little<00:01:49.610> bit<00:01:49.820> of<00:01:50.740> plastidip<00:01:51.740> on<00:01:51.950> there

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
little bit of plastidip on there

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.790 
little bit of plastidip on there
something<00:01:52.460> like<00:01:52.520> that<00:01:52.730> might<00:01:52.970> help<00:01:53.500> ok<00:01:54.530> well

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800 
something like that might help ok well

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.880 
something like that might help ok well
they<00:01:55.400> go<00:01:55.550> you<00:01:55.670> can<00:01:55.790> save<00:01:55.970> yourself<00:01:56.330> a<00:01:56.710> lot<00:01:57.710> of

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
they go you can save yourself a lot of

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.260 
they go you can save yourself a lot of
money<00:01:57.980> if<00:01:58.250> as<00:01:58.460> long<00:01:58.490> as<00:01:58.670> you<00:01:58.760> got<00:01:58.850> the<00:01:58.970> battery

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
money if as long as you got the battery

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.460 
money if as long as you got the battery
here<00:02:00.700> you<00:02:01.700> can<00:02:01.970> I<00:02:02.420> think<00:02:02.840> the<00:02:03.140> two<00:02:03.260> of<00:02:03.380> these

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
here you can I think the two of these

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.270 
here you can I think the two of these
together<00:02:03.680> were<00:02:04.220> maybe<00:02:05.120> five<00:02:05.450> dollars<00:02:05.930> so<00:02:06.650> I'm

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
together were maybe five dollars so I'm

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.999 
together were maybe five dollars so I'm
going<00:02:07.460> to<00:02:07.490> make<00:02:07.640> another<00:02:07.850> one<00:02:08.060> here<00:02:08.390> and<00:02:09.009> keep

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
going to make another one here and keep

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.930 
going to make another one here and keep
it<00:02:10.099> as<00:02:10.189> a<00:02:10.219> spare<00:02:10.640> so

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
it as a spare so

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.240 
it as a spare so
