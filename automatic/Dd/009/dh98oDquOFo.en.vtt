00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.570 
script and you basically have to make

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.240

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:18.250 
your decision based on that one script

your decision based on that one script
and<00:00:19.619> there<00:00:20.619> was<00:00:20.830> something<00:00:21.369> about<00:00:22.740> Harker<00:00:23.740> in

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:23.950 
and there was something about Harker in

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.390 
and there was something about Harker in
the<00:00:24.160> first<00:00:24.400> episode<00:00:24.970> that<00:00:25.470> was<00:00:26.470> quite<00:00:26.890> dark

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:27.400 
the first episode that was quite dark

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.019 
the first episode that was quite dark
and<00:00:27.730> I<00:00:28.660> felt<00:00:29.020> like<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:30.550> way<00:00:30.730> it'd<00:00:30.880> been

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:31.029 
and I felt like the way it'd been

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.260 
and I felt like the way it'd been
written<00:00:31.270> there<00:00:31.930> was<00:00:32.050> so<00:00:32.320> much<00:00:32.560> more<00:00:33.150> that<00:00:34.150> was

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 
written there was so much more that was

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:35.520 
written there was so much more that was
going<00:00:34.420> to<00:00:34.480> happen<00:00:34.660> to<00:00:34.960> him<00:00:35.110> and<00:00:35.260> I<00:00:35.290> thought<00:00:35.470> he

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
going to happen to him and I thought he

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.010 
going to happen to him and I thought he
was<00:00:35.739> a<00:00:35.770> he<00:00:36.460> was<00:00:36.489> a<00:00:36.610> he<00:00:36.970> was<00:00:37.300> a<00:00:37.360> very<00:00:37.660> kind<00:00:37.870> of

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.020 
was a he was a he was a very kind of

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.139 
was a he was a he was a very kind of
interesting<00:00:38.470> character<00:00:38.829> because<00:00:39.100> he<00:00:39.460> it

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:40.149 
interesting character because he it

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:42.120 
interesting character because he it
wasn't<00:00:40.600> on<00:00:40.690> the<00:00:40.840> page<00:00:41.079> in<00:00:41.470> a<00:00:41.590> way<00:00:41.710> so<00:00:41.770> there<00:00:42.040> was

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.130 
wasn't on the page in a way so there was

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.040 
wasn't on the page in a way so there was
so<00:00:42.280> much<00:00:42.460> more<00:00:42.670> room<00:00:42.940> to<00:00:42.969> kind<00:00:43.329> of<00:00:43.390> expand<00:00:43.840> and

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 
so much more room to kind of expand and

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.049 
so much more room to kind of expand and
explore<00:00:44.440> and<00:00:44.739> to<00:00:45.250> find<00:00:45.430> out<00:00:45.550> what<00:00:45.640> they<00:00:45.820> wanted

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:46.059 
explore and to find out what they wanted

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:49.740 
explore and to find out what they wanted
to<00:00:46.149> do<00:00:46.269> with<00:00:46.449> him<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:47.739> and<00:00:48.579> I<00:00:48.670> I<00:00:48.699> just<00:00:49.239> like<00:00:49.539> the

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
to do with him and and I I just like the

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.220 
to do with him and and I I just like the
fact<00:00:49.960> that<00:00:50.170> here<00:00:50.649> was<00:00:50.800> a<00:00:50.829> man<00:00:51.210> sort<00:00:52.210> of<00:00:52.300> in<00:00:52.719> you

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
fact that here was a man sort of in you

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.470 
fact that here was a man sort of in you
know<00:00:53.350> with<00:00:53.620> a<00:00:53.649> massive<00:00:53.980> contrast<00:00:54.670> to<00:00:54.879> Grayson

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 
know with a massive contrast to Grayson

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.340 
know with a massive contrast to Grayson
that<00:00:56.079> has<00:00:56.320> nothing<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:58.480> has<00:00:58.719> the<00:00:58.960> love<00:00:59.109> of<00:00:59.230> his

00:00:59.340 --> 00:00:59.350 
that has nothing and has the love of his

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.380 
that has nothing and has the love of his
life<00:00:59.379> and<00:00:59.920> then<00:01:00.129> ends<00:01:00.280> up<00:01:00.550> sort<00:01:00.969> of<00:01:01.089> selling

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
life and then ends up sort of selling

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.630 
life and then ends up sort of selling
his<00:01:01.510> soul<00:01:01.809> but<00:01:02.260> then<00:01:02.410> loses<00:01:02.949> the<00:01:03.249> love<00:01:03.429> of<00:01:03.519> his

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
his soul but then loses the love of his

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.979 
his soul but then loses the love of his
life<00:01:03.670> and<00:01:03.969> I<00:01:04.089> just<00:01:04.269> thought<00:01:04.360> it<00:01:04.510> was<00:01:04.600> quite<00:01:04.780> an

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
life and I just thought it was quite an

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.170 
life and I just thought it was quite an
interesting<00:01:05.250> kind<00:01:06.250> of<00:01:06.310> dynamic<00:01:06.940> between

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
interesting kind of dynamic between

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.970 
interesting kind of dynamic between
Grayson<00:01:07.810> and<00:01:07.930> Harker<00:01:08.350> and<00:01:08.470> the<00:01:08.530> contrast

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:08.980 
Grayson and Harker and the contrast

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.649 
Grayson and Harker and the contrast
between<00:01:09.100> the<00:01:09.400> two<00:01:09.580> I<00:01:09.610> thought<00:01:09.970> would<00:01:10.630> be

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 
between the two I thought would be

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:12.330 
between the two I thought would be
really<00:01:10.990> interesting<00:01:11.409> to<00:01:11.500> play<00:01:11.620> and<00:01:11.980> I'd<00:01:12.159> also

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
really interesting to play and I'd also

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.510 
really interesting to play and I'd also
always<00:01:12.970> been<00:01:13.180> a<00:01:13.210> massive<00:01:13.900> fan<00:01:14.140> of<00:01:14.170> Jonathan<00:01:14.770> so

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
always been a massive fan of Jonathan so

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.490 
always been a massive fan of Jonathan so
Rhys<00:01:16.060> Meyers<00:01:16.240> and<00:01:16.630> I'd<00:01:16.840> always<00:01:16.990> wanted<00:01:17.410> to

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
Rhys Meyers and I'd always wanted to

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.130 
Rhys Meyers and I'd always wanted to
work<00:01:17.650> with<00:01:17.710> him<00:01:18.040> so<00:01:18.310> I<00:01:18.610> was<00:01:19.150> sort<00:01:19.480> of<00:01:19.510> excited

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
work with him so I was sort of excited

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.070 
work with him so I was sort of excited
about<00:01:20.290> that<00:01:20.500> I<00:01:20.530> guess

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.740 

there<00:01:24.980> are<00:01:25.130> there<00:01:25.430> were

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
there are there were

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.630 
there are there were
differences<00:01:26.230> between<00:01:26.290> brown<00:01:26.890> sloka<00:01:27.190> story<00:01:27.520> in

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
differences between brown sloka story in

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.010 
differences between brown sloka story in
this<00:01:27.820> one<00:01:28.090> I<00:01:28.240> think<00:01:28.480> what<00:01:28.570> they've<00:01:28.690> done<00:01:28.870> is

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
this one I think what they've done is

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.710 
this one I think what they've done is
they<00:01:29.140> taken<00:01:29.680> they've<00:01:30.610> taken<00:01:30.850> the<00:01:31.090> the<00:01:31.120> sort<00:01:31.690> of

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
they taken they've taken the the sort of

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.550 
they taken they've taken the the sort of
main<00:01:31.990> elements<00:01:32.680> of<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:34.180> know<00:01:34.300> saw<00:01:34.990> Stoker's

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
main elements of you know saw Stoker's

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.820 
main elements of you know saw Stoker's
story<00:01:36.130> and<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:37.600> modernized<00:01:38.290> them<00:01:38.530> in<00:01:38.620> a<00:01:38.680> way

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
story and and modernized them in a way

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.530 
story and and modernized them in a way
but<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:42.130> relationship<00:01:42.880> between<00:01:43.000> Mina<00:01:43.330> Hawk

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:43.540 
but the relationship between Mina Hawk

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.780 
but the relationship between Mina Hawk
Amina<00:01:43.960> and<00:01:44.050> Harker<00:01:44.530> still<00:01:45.040> remains<00:01:45.340> pretty

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:45.790 
Amina and Harker still remains pretty

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.670 
Amina and Harker still remains pretty
much<00:01:46.150> the<00:01:46.390> same

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
much the same

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.650 
much the same
they've<00:01:48.640> just<00:01:49.060> I<00:01:49.300> think<00:01:49.510> they've<00:01:49.630> just

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:49.660 
they've just I think they've just

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.609 
they've just I think they've just
they've<00:01:49.960> updated<00:01:50.260> it<00:01:50.860> to<00:01:51.040> a<00:01:51.340> sort<00:01:52.090> of<00:01:52.150> a<00:01:52.619> story

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
they've updated it to a sort of a story

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.670 
they've updated it to a sort of a story
that<00:01:53.920> still<00:01:54.280> as<00:01:55.060> compelling<00:01:55.660> as<00:01:56.080> the<00:01:56.200> original

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
that still as compelling as the original

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.580 
that still as compelling as the original
but<00:01:57.400> um<00:01:57.840> but<00:01:58.840> I<00:01:58.930> think<00:01:58.960> there's<00:01:59.229> a<00:01:59.290> bit<00:01:59.440> more

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
but um but I think there's a bit more

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.410 
but um but I think there's a bit more
excitement<00:02:00.040> to<00:02:00.369> it<00:02:00.700> there's<00:02:00.970> there's<00:02:01.240> there's

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
excitement to it there's there's there's
