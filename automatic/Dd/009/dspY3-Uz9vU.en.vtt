prep well starting at the base we'll
talk<00:00:13.650> about<00:00:13.830> the<00:00:14.160> hitch<00:00:14.370> pin<00:00:14.639> or<00:00:14.849> lack<00:00:15.120> of

00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:15.289 
talk about the hitch pin or lack of

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:17.390 
talk about the hitch pin or lack of
instead<00:00:16.289> of<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.410> hitch<00:00:16.529> pin<00:00:16.770> this<00:00:16.920> assembly

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
instead of the hitch pin this assembly

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.880 
instead of the hitch pin this assembly
has<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:17.640> bolt<00:00:18.029> that<00:00:18.390> holds<00:00:18.449> it<00:00:18.810> in<00:00:18.869> place<00:00:19.050> which

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
has a bolt that holds it in place which

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.250 
has a bolt that holds it in place which
is<00:00:20.010> a<00:00:20.039> simple<00:00:20.340> deal<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.359> you<00:00:21.660> screw<00:00:22.080> it<00:00:22.170> in

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
is a simple deal and you screw it in

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.349 
is a simple deal and you screw it in
when<00:00:22.769> we<00:00:22.830> tighten<00:00:23.070> it<00:00:23.189> down<00:00:23.250> in<00:00:23.609> essentially

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
when we tighten it down in essentially

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.970 
when we tighten it down in essentially
makes<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.630> bike<00:00:24.779> rack<00:00:25.050> one-piece<00:00:25.529> three<00:00:25.769> hitch

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
makes a bike rack one-piece three hitch

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.130 
makes a bike rack one-piece three hitch
so<00:00:26.340> it<00:00:26.400> doesn't<00:00:26.670> rattle<00:00:26.820> around<00:00:27.000> move<00:00:27.449> or<00:00:27.990> make

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
so it doesn't rattle around move or make

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.929 
so it doesn't rattle around move or make
noise<00:00:28.289> another<00:00:28.920> nice<00:00:29.130> feature<00:00:29.369> about<00:00:29.670> this

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
noise another nice feature about this

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.060 
noise another nice feature about this
rack<00:00:30.240> is<00:00:30.269> is<00:00:30.660> that<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.960> crack<00:00:31.199> itself<00:00:31.529> tilts

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
rack is is that the crack itself tilts

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.290 
rack is is that the crack itself tilts
because<00:00:32.369> you<00:00:32.520> have<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:32.730> get<00:00:32.880> in<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.030> back<00:00:33.180> of

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
because you have to get in the back of

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.810 
because you have to get in the back of
your<00:00:33.420> SUV<00:00:33.540> or<00:00:34.380> truck<00:00:34.410> or<00:00:34.770> whatnot<00:00:34.950> even<00:00:35.489> simply

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
your SUV or truck or whatnot even simply

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.119 
your SUV or truck or whatnot even simply
some<00:00:36.059> fun<00:00:36.390> stuff<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.719> pin<00:00:36.930> let<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.530> rack<00:00:37.920> down

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
some fun stuff to pin let the rack down

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.619 
some fun stuff to pin let the rack down
so<00:00:38.340> get<00:00:38.460> in<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.640> back<00:00:38.820> without<00:00:39.090> having<00:00:39.540> to

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
so get in the back without having to

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:48.610 
so get in the back without having to
take<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.870> whole<00:00:40.020> assembly<00:00:40.140> off

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.480 

next<00:00:49.620> we'll<00:00:49.710> talk<00:00:49.830> about<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:50.070> cradles

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:50.490 
next we'll talk about the cradles

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.070 
next we'll talk about the cradles
themselves<00:00:50.580> they're<00:00:51.270> real<00:00:51.420> nice<00:00:51.570> in<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.840> fact

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:52.080 
themselves they're real nice in the fact

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.810 
themselves they're real nice in the fact
that<00:00:52.170> they<00:00:52.350> can<00:00:52.500> be<00:00:52.710> adjusted<00:00:53.250> front<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.640> rear

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
that they can be adjusted front to rear

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.770 
that they can be adjusted front to rear
or<00:00:54.030> left<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.720> right<00:00:58.340> and<00:00:59.450> also<00:01:00.450> that<00:01:00.690> the

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
or left to right and also that the

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.140 
or left to right and also that the
cradles<00:01:01.140> themselves<00:01:01.230> have<00:01:02.160> groove<00:01:02.700> them<00:01:02.970> to

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.150 
cradles themselves have groove them to

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.119 
cradles themselves have groove them to
keep<00:01:03.300> room<00:01:03.750> for<00:01:03.930> your<00:01:03.989> cables<00:01:04.379> on<00:01:04.739> your<00:01:04.979> back

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
keep room for your cables on your back

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.410 
keep room for your cables on your back
so<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.309> don't<00:01:05.339> mash<00:01:05.670> up<00:01:05.820> against<00:01:06.060> your<00:01:06.180> frame

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
so you don't mash up against your frame

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.690 
so you don't mash up against your frame
as<00:01:07.410> an<00:01:07.620> additional<00:01:08.010> note<00:01:08.220> we'll<00:01:08.430> take<00:01:08.580> him

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
as an additional note we'll take him

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.400 
as an additional note we'll take him
outside<00:01:08.880> measurement<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.690> cradle<00:01:10.050> succeeds

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:10.410 
outside measurement of cradle succeeds

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
different bike frames glasses sit on

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.790 
different bike frames glasses sit on
their<00:01:25.350> head

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
their head

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.650 
their head
we'll<00:01:26.070> start<00:01:26.280> off<00:01:26.399> with<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:27.060> standard<00:01:27.450> frame

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:27.660 
we'll start off with a standard frame

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:39.060 
we'll start off with a standard frame
bikes

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.260 

as<00:01:40.070> you<00:01:40.250> can<00:01:40.340> see<00:01:40.520> if<00:01:40.610> you<00:01:40.700> look<00:01:40.850> down<00:01:40.970> the<00:01:41.119> line

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
as you can see if you look down the line

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.760 
as you can see if you look down the line
of<00:01:41.450> the<00:01:41.510> cable<00:01:41.869> so<00:01:42.049> go<00:01:42.200> right<00:01:42.440> into<00:01:42.650> the

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
of the cable so go right into the

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.310 
of the cable so go right into the
Brewers<00:01:43.070> already<00:01:44.030> pre-made<00:01:44.450> into<00:01:44.840> the<00:01:44.960> cradle

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
Brewers already pre-made into the cradle

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.170 
Brewers already pre-made into the cradle
so<00:01:45.530> they<00:01:45.650> will<00:01:46.130> not<00:01:46.250> get<00:01:46.430> pinched<00:01:46.790> against<00:01:47.119> a

so they will not get pinched against a
frame<00:01:47.420> now<00:01:48.260> we'll<00:01:48.380> go<00:01:48.500> ahead<00:01:48.619> and<00:01:48.740> install

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040
