00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.869
 this weekend the circuit noves 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.820
 wanted to touch and invaded the great river of the south 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.500
 for its ninth stage of the year 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.610
 is the fifth time in history that 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.460
 main category of motorsport 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.770
 takes place at the velopark racetrack 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:39.400
 located in the municipality of nova santa 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:41.890
 rita that with 2,278 meters is the circuit 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.809
 shorter of our calendar in the 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.220
 four previous races four 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:47.650
 different victories 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.629
 ricardo maurício attila abreu daniel 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:51.580
 sierra and caca good 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.650
 now will wait and see if any 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.659
 them will do it again us today 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:58.390
 will have a new face there in the most 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:01:01.000
 top of the podium here of the gaucho track she 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.379
 get a short runway to where 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.870
 makes all the riders neither 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.520
 practically the same tenth is fine 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.670
 here the time between all the 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.290
 pilots and any half-three 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.540
 hundredths will make a difference 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.880
 maybe a pole with a second place and the 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.600
 people know that it is very important to drop 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.670
 ahead 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.470
 I really like the velopark is a clue that 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.750
 really had a project entirely 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.520
 of being bigger but this boy remained 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.229
 kartódromo we can say so that the 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.939
 people already know how to play but it's a life 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:30.460
 very very complete it has a good 

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:32.530
 good structure overtakes then here 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:36.250
 it is a very much disputed thing where the 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.350
 public is well enough to be able to 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.350
 walks a lot helping several laps is a 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:45.399
 track that demands very physically is 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:48.189
 always turning the straight lines are short and 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:49.299
 It's nice to drive and not cool, and things 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:51.759
 here are always cool are well 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:53.920
 exciting with a basket to pass through the 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.649
 end of the day after taking time 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.659
 in ensuring the best place on the grid was 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.700
 He is a good caca who is the current leader of the 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.100
 already won the sheet here in the 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.200
 velopark three times and has already won 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.299
 only this year he has not yet 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.850
 I left on pole he talked to me 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.680
 you check now kaka pole position 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.060
 here in Velopark for the fourth time of 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.069
 our four races that happened 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.230
 here you did pole three times won a 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.120
 of races but this year you still do not 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.620
 had won no pole 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.970
 Do you want to know how the work went on here? 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.650
 weekend to get this 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.360
 result is so good the work of 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.010
 It's always really that we changed a 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.560
 the concept in recent years to 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.970
 talk here at the beginning of my career and 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.560
 everywhere partners has always been a 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.860
 face of making much poorer than 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.480
 win the race 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.040
 is always a fast guy but sometimes 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.260
 I did not take long to win my 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.480
 first playing title focused a lot 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.860
 in being fast and I think the last few years 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.450
 to change this way of working a little 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.250
 not forgetting the speed but 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.570
 working to be consistent to 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.150
 win races to take the points 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:52.850
 who does the pole does not even a speck in 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.010
 win the race today takes 24 then it is 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.010
 had changed a little, the focus was on the 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.020
 Sunday but that does not mean I do not 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.340
 I'm glad of the life of making the pole was 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.950
 One thing I was looking for was one thing. 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.200
 that gives more motivation but we work 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.330
 for Sunday but the speed of the car 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.160
 race for Sunday was enough 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.250
 to make the cheerleading police not 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.050
 I had been going long in the past 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.200
 two years had not been happening so much 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.910
 then release again at the front and then 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.090
 not know how many races 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.980
 it's really exciting and we're even more 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.980
 hope for the rest of the championship 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.590
 This is very good to win kaka by 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.810
 one more pole in the career now you 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.450
 Follow our race tomorrow to 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.590
