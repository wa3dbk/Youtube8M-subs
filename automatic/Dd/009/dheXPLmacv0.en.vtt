you have your cup right here but on the
other<00:03:07.299> stanley<00:03:07.780> model<00:03:08.790> another<00:03:09.790> way<00:03:09.970> they'll

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
other stanley model another way they'll

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.130 
other stanley model another way they'll
do<00:03:10.659> it<00:03:10.840> they'll<00:03:11.440> give<00:03:11.620> you<00:03:11.739> the<00:03:12.000> top<00:03:13.000> there<00:03:13.390> but

do it they'll give you the top there but
this<00:03:14.349> this<00:03:14.680> thing<00:03:14.980> instead<00:03:15.519> of<00:03:15.640> having<00:03:15.849> a

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
this this thing instead of having a

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.949 
this this thing instead of having a
instead<00:03:17.530> of<00:03:17.620> having<00:03:17.769> a<00:03:17.950> normal<00:03:18.130> lid<00:03:18.720> like<00:03:19.720> this

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
instead of having a normal lid like this

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.229 
instead of having a normal lid like this
one<00:03:20.200> that<00:03:20.319> goes<00:03:20.500> right<00:03:20.739> in<00:03:20.919> just<00:03:21.669> screws<00:03:22.030> in

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
one that goes right in just screws in

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.839 
one that goes right in just screws in
you<00:03:23.109> can<00:03:23.260> get<00:03:23.380> this<00:03:23.590> where<00:03:23.950> you<00:03:24.040> can<00:03:24.190> loosen<00:03:24.700> it

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:24.849 
you can get this where you can loosen it

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:28.830 
you can get this where you can loosen it
up<00:03:24.940> a<00:03:25.060> little<00:03:25.150> bit<00:03:25.359> and<00:03:25.720> it<00:03:26.260> actually<00:03:27.840> will

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
up a little bit and it actually will

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.430 
up a little bit and it actually will
pour<00:03:29.349> your<00:03:29.919> drink<00:03:30.250> out<00:03:32.310> it's<00:03:33.310> a<00:03:33.430> little<00:03:33.669> bit

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
pour your drink out it's a little bit

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.900 
pour your drink out it's a little bit
that's<00:03:35.440> nice<00:03:35.680> if<00:03:35.980> your<00:03:38.430> with<00:03:39.430> a<00:03:39.459> couple<00:03:39.849> of

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
that's nice if your with a couple of

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:44.780 
that's nice if your with a couple of
people<00:03:40.269> want<00:03:40.720> to<00:03:41.250> share<00:03:42.250> whatever<00:03:42.790> you<00:03:42.970> got

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
people want to share whatever you got

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.680 
people want to share whatever you got
probably<00:03:45.790> one<00:03:45.879> of<00:03:45.970> the<00:03:46.090> one<00:03:46.359> of<00:03:46.449> the<00:03:46.510> really

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
probably one of the one of the really

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.930 
probably one of the one of the really
nice<00:03:46.810> things<00:03:47.109> though<00:03:47.319> is<00:03:47.579> these<00:03:48.579> are<00:03:48.760> all

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
nice things though is these are all

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.030 
nice things though is these are all
interchangeable<00:03:50.099> so<00:03:51.209> say<00:03:52.209> I<00:03:52.810> want<00:03:53.199> I<00:03:53.470> want<00:03:53.919> to

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
interchangeable so say I want I want to

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.430 
interchangeable so say I want I want to
keep<00:03:54.340> the<00:03:54.730> most<00:03:54.940> heat<00:03:55.120> retention<00:03:55.419> take<00:03:56.230> this

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
keep the most heat retention take this

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.229 
keep the most heat retention take this
one<00:03:56.650> put<00:03:57.250> it<00:03:57.340> in<00:03:57.400> the<00:03:57.519> unit<00:03:57.790> that<00:03:57.879> I<00:03:57.970> want<00:03:58.150> to

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
one put it in the unit that I want to

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.869
