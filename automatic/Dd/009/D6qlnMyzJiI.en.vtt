bro<00:00:06.960> jmac<00:00:07.529> and<00:00:07.799> we<00:00:08.280> are<00:00:08.490> playing<00:00:09.210> on<00:00:09.480> a<00:00:09.510> map<00:00:09.780> but

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
bro jmac and we are playing on a map but

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.129 
bro jmac and we are playing on a map but
just<00:00:10.679> look<00:00:11.130> at<00:00:11.250> what<00:00:11.400> i<00:00:11.460> believe<00:00:11.730> and<00:00:12.420> i<00:00:12.840> think

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
just look at what i believe and i think

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.810 
just look at what i believe and i think
this<00:00:13.230> one<00:00:13.440> is<00:00:13.469> probably<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:14.070> best<00:00:14.280> map<00:00:14.519> out<00:00:14.730> of

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
this one is probably the best map out of

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.800 
this one is probably the best map out of
all<00:00:15.000> of<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.330> four<00:00:15.630> for<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.139> face<00:00:16.859> off<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.810> i

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
all of the four for the face off and i

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.689 
all of the four for the face off and i
really<00:00:19.439> think<00:00:19.680> that<00:00:19.800> this<00:00:20.070> hill<00:00:20.430> right<00:00:20.670> here

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
really think that this hill right here

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.960 
really think that this hill right here
is<00:00:21.210> really<00:00:21.869> powerful<00:00:22.140> now<00:00:22.590> this<00:00:23.580> want<00:00:23.820> to<00:00:23.880> be

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
is really powerful now this want to be

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.330 
is really powerful now this want to be
one<00:00:24.150> thing<00:00:24.480> they're<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.289> two<00:00:25.470> V<00:00:25.590> two<00:00:25.619> here<00:00:26.189> is

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
one thing they're the two V two here is

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.429 
one thing they're the two V two here is
that<00:00:26.910> they<00:00:27.390> only<00:00:27.420> have<00:00:27.689> two<00:00:27.900> different<00:00:28.080> places

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
that they only have two different places

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.169 
that they only have two different places
to<00:00:28.740> spawn<00:00:28.980> they<00:00:29.279> have<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.699> left<00:00:29.970> from<00:00:30.150> that

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
to spawn they have the left from that

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.359 
to spawn they have the left from that
little<00:00:30.420> bit<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:30.810> guess<00:00:30.960> you<00:00:31.260> could<00:00:31.380> say<00:00:31.529> like

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
little bit I guess you could say like

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.270 
little bit I guess you could say like
bunker<00:00:33.149> kind<00:00:33.420> of<00:00:33.480> thing<00:00:33.690> down<00:00:33.899> there<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.350> they

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
bunker kind of thing down there and they

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.250 
bunker kind of thing down there and they
can<00:00:35.550> go<00:00:35.700> in<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.000> far<00:00:36.239> right<00:00:36.510> corner<00:00:36.780> where

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
can go in the far right corner where

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.930 
can go in the far right corner where
it's<00:00:37.440> just<00:00:38.040> behind<00:00:38.280> this<00:00:38.460> building<00:00:38.700> right

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
it's just behind this building right

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.310 
it's just behind this building right
here<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.360> they'll<00:00:39.540> just<00:00:39.660> keep<00:00:39.840> spawning<00:00:40.140> in

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
here and they'll just keep spawning in

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.900 
here and they'll just keep spawning in
those<00:00:40.440> two<00:00:40.590> spots<00:00:40.739> that's<00:00:41.219> why<00:00:41.370> i<00:00:41.399> like<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.730> map

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
those two spots that's why i like to map

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.119 
those two spots that's why i like to map
the<00:00:42.120> best<00:00:42.300> cuz<00:00:42.480> it's<00:00:42.629> easy<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.410> easiest<00:00:43.920> to

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
the best cuz it's easy to the easiest to

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.400

which<00:01:49.470> i<00:01:49.649> think<00:01:49.710> is<00:01:49.920> really<00:01:50.100> cool<00:01:50.490> I've<00:01:51.149> never

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
which i think is really cool I've never

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.060 
which i think is really cool I've never
really<00:01:51.570> been<00:01:51.600> a<00:01:51.750> big<00:01:51.840> fan<00:01:52.229> of<00:01:52.259> 1v<00:01:52.500> ones<00:01:52.829> because

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
they don't prove much and I always

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.450 
they don't prove much and I always
thought<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:55.170> know<00:01:55.229> private<00:01:56.009> match<00:01:56.130> one<00:01:56.369> of

you once don't really mean much for the

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.160 
you once don't really mean much for the
fact<00:01:58.290> that<00:01:58.469> you<00:01:59.009> know<00:01:59.750> it's<00:02:00.750> kind<00:02:01.049> of<00:02:01.079> just

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
fact that you know it's kind of just

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.260

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
kind of ruined it for me for the most

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.280 
kind of ruined it for me for the most
part<00:02:13.879> but<00:02:14.150> you<00:02:14.450> know<00:02:14.569> I<00:02:14.599> kind<00:02:14.930> of<00:02:15.019> like<00:02:15.140> this

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
part but you know I kind of like this

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.050 
part but you know I kind of like this
one<00:02:15.500> be<00:02:15.650> one<00:02:15.830> thing<00:02:16.340> especially<00:02:16.670> since

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
one be one thing especially since

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.600 
one be one thing especially since
they're<00:02:17.239> on<00:02:17.360> different<00:02:17.840> maps<00:02:18.260> and<00:02:18.620> I<00:02:18.980> do<00:02:19.280> think

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
they're on different maps and I do think

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:20.949 
they're on different maps and I do think
they're<00:02:19.730> pretty<00:02:19.910> fair<00:02:20.239> and<00:02:20.420> even<00:02:20.690> for<00:02:20.870> the

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
they're pretty fair and even for the

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.039 
they're pretty fair and even for the
most<00:02:21.080> part<00:02:21.379> and<00:02:21.879> it's<00:02:22.879> that's<00:02:23.450> why<00:02:23.660> i<00:02:23.690> think<00:02:23.840> i

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:24.049 
most part and it's that's why i think i

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:27.000 
most part and it's that's why i think i
actually<00:02:24.470> enjoy<00:02:24.920> the<00:02:25.069> one<00:02:25.220> view<00:02:25.430> once<00:02:25.610> and<00:02:25.879> my

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
actually enjoy the one view once and my

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.190
