00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:10.729
 see the army watered by m 

00:00:10.729 --> 00:00:11.939
 the vegetation 

00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:14.939
 that's the kodiak 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:18.929
 two reviewed 

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:21.480
 tied to a not quite fit mans 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.109
 only for the clan under cover of anonymity 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:27.109
 over 100 m 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.279
 it's a theater that looks like a boat 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.630
 arrived a little up 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.630
 she plans to sell 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.560
 will she 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.560
 which 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.830
 a rank with 38 points 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.140
 read the article 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.480
 on a buoyancy batting 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.880
 it's gone again my wish 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.310
 we see here 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.420
 the loading 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.670
 we will find in there 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.670
 in lengths of chelsea that is 5 meters 18 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.190
 it has a payload of 150 kilos 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.640
 besides understood 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.120
 it has a useful volume of 2,374 liters 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.480
 finally we have to reduce it to a little bit because 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.160
 why for example the masters of things completely the size for 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.000
 make some room for the key 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
 eacl and sacred 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.030
 difficult to sell the paddler we have this species 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.290
 which looks a bit awkward at all to put things forward 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.520
 percent paddling 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.520
 without having to go to them 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.660
 your group 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.590
 marc fournier inside the questions 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.590
 when all is well 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.310
 my education 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.310
 sneaks when you have a life that flows sacred 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.799
 so inside what we can see already won five titles is great 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.680
 important and it's a special dedication to pascale 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.870
 we have 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:05.909
 m a seat 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.509
 % especially at least one fly 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.509
 and that makes me feel quite fit that is adjustable 

00:02:12.929 --> 00:02:15.929
 we move forward and we can go back we can adjust but at the backrest angle 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.880
 little important remark that are well away from the place behind 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:20.849
 for a small bag 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.019
 Saturday 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.129
 under the pedals 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:27.129
 for a small bag 

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:30.079
 we have also compartment again 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.079
 as for them we see all through the wood while running the line of life 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.709
 so theirs again something she attesting to the fact that the basin 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.099
 hungarian boat 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.469
 we have the chains click here behind we must leave the 

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:46.339
 we will see the holes through which pass for him fly 

00:02:47.029 --> 00:02:47.900
 cables 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.259
 the rudder that will be lodged there 

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:55.079
 ricky ray will be piloted apartir and pedestrians rudder afp in the beginning 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:55.599
 year 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.449
 rudder that is imperative 

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:59.509
 to maintain a privilege 

00:02:59.509 --> 00:03:02.509
 even in case of crosswind 

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:09.729
 liabilities atypical a record low that must hold so the fly of 

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:11.489
 the absolute of love adjustable 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.840
 different steve oldfield verdict that we can hear the places at 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.699
 rudder 

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:21.699

00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:24.910
 tepco extended 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.910
 happiness 

00:03:29.249 --> 00:03:32.119
 just in the last two decades 

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:33.229
 this web page 

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:35.829
 but just watch it loop 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:39.109
 so we'll go for a ride we'll test it 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:41.579
 will not be able to overcome in the sleeve do not you 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.969
 convinced that salvation 

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:45.689
 the times a lot of expansion 

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:48.689
 and then the lines 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:52.819
 that is to say, he is advancing 

00:03:54.249 --> 00:03:56.730
 which is a little big volume the edile 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.370
 how would you like me to tell you for a few months 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.290
 young people who make a lot of noise
