 tell friends an interesting story once a 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.650
 airport in attack memories went with 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.220
 but nice 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:23.779
 in particular, when we were leaving the USSR 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:27.119
 it was november late november 1990 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:31.320
 another world was and with the tickets it was creepy 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.930
 there and buy there and the money was not difficult 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.510
 and all sorts of stories but it turned out so 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:40.230
 the story that was one grandfather and my 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:44.070
 grandpa buddy and grandpa had to 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.930
 come to sit with your granddaughter and guys 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.120
 waiting for him they were already in america they were there 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.000
 all made out by itself grandfather already 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.829
 deceased now he is not 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.870
 fit for life a man like him 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:01.109
 it was difficult very simple as the ear was 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.590
 difficult and they transferred currency with whom so 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.960
 toyota 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.210
 we bought bilir for currency then 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.549
 it was possible so I am afraid to lie 200 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.799
 dollars the rest of the currency in rubles and without 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:15.290
 queues buy a ticket shorter we bought 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:17.270
 he has calves and we also have them there 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:21.460
 there are such tribulations bought themselves tickets 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.920
 and there was such a situation that he 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.620
 flew away maybe an hour earlier on 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.900
 voyage on foot bath 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.520
 turnover he had to get out of the marks 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.740
 fly to new york so maybe 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.640
 the combination is then right on Lier 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.350

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.810
