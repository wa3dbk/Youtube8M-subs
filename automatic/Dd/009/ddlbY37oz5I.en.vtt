 great benefits of papain is that it is

 in vitamin a is the number 3 low point 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.000
 of weight invariably one of the 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.010
 most important qualities of 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.490
 enzymes of the papaya is that it starts to 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.740
 to break 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.689
 to the body fat that you have and in this 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.159
 case it is highly recommended that what 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:32.600
 you can do is include it in your diet 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.580
 that I'll explain next 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.560
 how it works and practically is 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.840
 demonstrated that the papaya enzymes 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.970
 they go directly to the abdomen that is to say that 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.950
 if you accumulate for example many llantitas 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.049
 or sometimes your belly too 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.000
 be much more inflamed when consuming them 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.159
 in a moderate way you will notice the 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.990
 results in a very short time point 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:53.000
 number four how can you include it in 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.189
 your diet is extremely simple 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.689
 example if you like to have breakfast papaya what 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:59.450
 what you can do is obviously start 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:01.789
 dish and then put it from 5 to 10 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.830
 papaya seeds that you have there or 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:06.200
 well you can prepare for example your 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.179
 Papaya water and you add it equal to 5 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.649
 10 do the minimum for 15 days and 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.080
 you will really notice how your digestion 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.760
 improvement and above all remember that the most 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.590
 important is how you start to get 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.900
 your clothes because practically what is going to 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.640
 start doing is reduce the fat that 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.830
 we have about all the women that 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.810
 we accumulate a lot in the abdomen and that 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.670
 way are very practical chips that you can 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.230
 start doing in your day to day or if you 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.370
 flat do not like much other 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.410
 recommendation that I give you is that in 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.370
 fasting what you do is consume 5 to 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.500
 10 seeds 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.659

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.220

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:39.680
