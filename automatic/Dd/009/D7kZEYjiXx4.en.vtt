comfort<00:01:21.180> zone<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:22.259> think<00:01:22.439> out<00:01:22.650> of<00:01:22.710> the<00:01:22.890> box

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.210 

I<00:01:27.750> believe<00:01:28.750> that<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.080> carrier<00:01:29.290> development

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220 
I believe that the carrier development

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.340 
I believe that the carrier development
would<00:01:30.490> be<00:01:30.670> an<00:01:30.820> integral<00:01:31.120> part<00:01:31.300> and<00:01:31.750> why<00:01:32.290> is

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
would be an integral part and why is

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.290 
would be an integral part and why is
this<00:01:32.710> so<00:01:32.920> because<00:01:33.340> most<00:01:33.760> of<00:01:33.910> the<00:01:34.030> participants

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.300 
this so because most of the participants

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.080 
this so because most of the participants
would<00:01:34.840> like<00:01:35.140> to<00:01:35.890> enhance<00:01:36.250> their<00:01:36.490> carrier<00:01:36.850> and

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
would like to enhance their carrier and

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:38.670 
would like to enhance their carrier and
to<00:01:37.210> have<00:01:37.330> better<00:01:37.540> opportunities<00:01:37.810> when<00:01:38.650> they

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
to have better opportunities when they
