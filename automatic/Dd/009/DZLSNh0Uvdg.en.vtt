 on my website that I always talk I spoke in 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:53.309
 village of last class and also said that

 so come on good then the first 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.470
 thing that is leaving a code that 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:27.600
 This is the first code for you. 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.200
 then this first code will have the 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.030
 effect of the 3d model in the first 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.740
 is not iml 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:40.470

 good people are making an appeal to everything 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.030
 this code 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.960
 But first I 'll explain that to you. 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.210

 according to the light and white that 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:40.920
 background color here is the code of the 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.990

 there is the zÃ© putting here in this 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:42.420
 space and providing another code 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:45.120
 leave the separated space a code that is 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:51.480
 where will you put the image to which the 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:56.910
 same dimensions right also giving the 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:59.670
 here make one since the width and 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:04.860
 height is 350 and you will have to 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:13.580
 could image right I 'll have a website 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:16.650
 cool it together with the image 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:19.160
 friend that the right dimension he insight 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.160
 October 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:29.360
 ready the direct link team you only 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:31.340
 is copying the copy jack link 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.250
 here you are placing the rule of your 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.330
 image is remembering that of these same 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.759
 dimensions 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.469
 Let's paste here and here you have to 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:40.969
