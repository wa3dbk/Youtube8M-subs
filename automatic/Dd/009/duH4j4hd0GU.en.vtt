00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
a video because I actually shared this

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.039 
a video because I actually shared this
tip<00:03:29.920> on<00:03:30.400> my<00:03:30.760> website<00:03:31.209> about<00:03:31.329> four<00:03:31.659> years<00:03:31.900> ago

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
tip on my website about four years ago

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:34.140 
tip on my website about four years ago
this<00:03:32.349> is<00:03:32.409> like<00:03:32.709> the<00:03:32.889> first<00:03:33.190> things<00:03:33.909> that<00:03:34.030> I

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
this is like the first things that I

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.180 
this is like the first things that I
learned<00:03:34.599> when<00:03:35.290> I<00:03:35.319> worked<00:03:35.560> at<00:03:35.680> Estee<00:03:35.950> Lauder

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
learned when I worked at Estee Lauder

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.030 
learned when I worked at Estee Lauder
many<00:03:36.670> many<00:03:36.879> years<00:03:37.090> ago<00:03:37.239> probably<00:03:38.010> 10<00:03:39.010> years

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
many many years ago probably 10 years

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.520 
many many years ago probably 10 years
ago<00:03:39.459> and<00:03:39.909> I<00:03:40.870> think<00:03:41.049> it's<00:03:41.139> just<00:03:41.170> one<00:03:41.379> of<00:03:41.409> the

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
ago and I think it's just one of the

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.289 
ago and I think it's just one of the
greatest<00:03:41.769> tips<00:03:42.040> every<00:03:42.370> they<00:03:42.760> actually<00:03:43.000> put<00:03:43.150> on

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
greatest tips every they actually put on

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:44.580 
greatest tips every they actually put on
to<00:03:43.420> do<00:03:43.540> this<00:03:43.629> looks<00:03:43.840> like<00:03:43.989> that<00:03:44.170> very<00:03:44.290> same<00:03:44.530> day

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
to do this looks like that very same day

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.449 
to do this looks like that very same day
because<00:03:45.010> somebody<00:03:45.340> submitted<00:03:45.879> my<00:03:46.150> tip<00:03:46.389> so<00:03:47.459> you
