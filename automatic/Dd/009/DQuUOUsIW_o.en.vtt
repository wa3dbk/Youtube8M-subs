00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:11.330
 again with our head giorgio vi 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:13.549
 let's see various alternatives though 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.379
 see the living room and the first of all 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:17.630
 let's see something that is there 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:20.810
 very close to the juxtaposition of the 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.920
 wood and color we have yellow breast 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:27.560
 mustard yellow that I am absolutely 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:30.380
 very actual and then and then a nice robert 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.029
 kromm an elm that kind of doing theater 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.100
 that text and I hope then almost one 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.690
 fitted wall to shoulder what 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.970
 means shoulder means everything 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.250
 play on these supporting shoulders this 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.480
 in particular it is a shoulder program 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.760
 suspended therefore means that each 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.340
 single element precisely suspended from 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.880
 land is the base with the transfers with i 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.220
 drawers 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.070
 among other things also the spotlight here for the 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.800
 tv stand definitely more useful both 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.500
 this part library disadvantage for not 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.870
 have the usual classic bookstore a little 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.370
 always always the usual but heavy 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.590
 maybe have it integrated inside 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.689
 of the equipped wall where passive 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.610
 put television for nothing 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:09.770
 these elements that can be precisely 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.990
 put and remove to divide then it 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.770
 space as you like according to some 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.600
 own needs 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.550
 I want to put a bit of objects a 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.990
 bit of books and I can divide apple trees like 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:23.120
 I want now giorgia shows us one 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.490
 slightly more traditional solution 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.230
 let's call it so exact with respect to 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.240
 perhaps from a wall equipped with the 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.980
 suspended bookcase we had seen before 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.480
 that beautiful beautiful already beautiful one 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.190
 beautiful exhibition of kakà tel 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.290
 drawn up we are also southern pairing of 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.240
 colors decidedly more traditional and 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.370
 this is the classic let's say the classic 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.900
 fitted wall that also includes the 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:47.020
 library always the same program 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:49.539
 we told you about shoulder 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.789
 from this part very comfortable it comes 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:54.579
 an integrated part of the container always 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:57.429
 maybe useful for all those things that 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:02:00.250
 maybe we want to hide not 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:02.109
 leave for strength seen as 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.960
 for example the bottles as you have 

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:07.030
 use city ​​exactly then obviously 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.890
 we have the part of the TV stand part 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.200
 because we absolutely have to integrate 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.970
 also the one with a beautiful one 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.010
 back panel all wood 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.750
 worked and we can choose it anyway 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.209
 also all in other finishes always 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:23.709
 lacquered as we want 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:27.099
 and under classic base with basket 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:29.200
 is worth the limelight as we wish we can 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:30.760
 choose the one we like best with 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.549
 integrated audio system 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.620
 we have a dock so we can 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:37.560
 listen to the music directly from us 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.810
 from the phone maybe 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.569
 with, among other things, the boxes integrated below 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.709
 so we have the whole sound system 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.310
 we can carry all that 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.380
 there is 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.500
 maybe in the phone photographs instead 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.239
 teac and music directly from the intel e 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:57.599
 in television precisely with the system 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:59.220
 exact audio the library obviously between 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:01.470
 the other compound element asca 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.390
 obviously gorgeous sliding that there 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.920
 it allows to arrive also in the part 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.959
 higher where we maybe have books that 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.540
 we read less local dwarf is the one for 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.310
 the shuttles cover is obviously not there 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:16.890
 arrive if the flood to take the 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:19.170
 more beautiful books and then a little more 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.390
 classic which is the showcase because often 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.130
 maybe in the homes of now especially 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.280
 those a little younger 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:29.190
 we don't have much space above all 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.360
 because we do n't have room for maybe 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.819
 everything therefore for an equipped wall 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:35.099
 for a bookcase for a sideboard for 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.810
 a showcase and then what we do but 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:38.760
 we simply mean everything in the 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.430
 equipped wall so we have area 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.160
 container bookcase area tv area e 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.680
 also because not just the display case 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.209
 so the bad service and the 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.100
 nice glasses service for all 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:53.630
 Our guests can put here 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.630
 because we have it 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:04:00.090
 absolutely not then we see the non 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.630
 plus ultra del and quite interesting 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.130
 already very large and extremely spacious 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.470
 all the details 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.600
 exact cabin always with the shoulder system 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.720
 this time the orientation you notice 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.670
 instead of being all vertical it is played 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.660
 on the other hand its positioning 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.630
 horizontal of the ideas of the various elements 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:21.000
 with these fantastic dividers that 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:24.000
 obviously they alternate the part we say of 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.010
 library in contrast so you can 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.660
 do the cat in different colors in this 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.340
 so it gives maybe a little bit more tone 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.290
 to the back of the bookstore that of 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.750
 usually always left a bit a bit has 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.520
 always that it is often covered and not e 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.010
 you don't see it this way instead they have 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.510
 a touch of color more and then for 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:46.890
 when the relaxation time comes 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:48.660
 evening there is tv also here with parents 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.880
 in the upper part is this beautiful 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:53.580
 slightly thinner glass partition with 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.110
 the games also play on as well as on 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:59.390
 different colors finishes also on 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:04.230
 materials lacquered wood and glass and then 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:05.669
 scrolling second zone second zone 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:09.030
 because we can be divided into two areas 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:10.980
 this Liguria is so big and this 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.750
 and for the home office because often on 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.210
 houses houses maybe a little smaller 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.710
 be it the need to have a 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.750
 corner mortis to work studying 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.010
 etc 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.570
 but we don't have a lot of space 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.700
 provision therefore in this case it 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:26.700
 integrate into the wall equipped with 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:29.250
 this element to rivalta and to this 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:31.500
 if I try this firmly to particular 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:33.450
 the classic piston is not very thin 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.680
 which holds up to 80 kg precisely because in 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:36.960
 this way we can rest the 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.390
 portable i can weigh myself c work do 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.950
 all I want to support was 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:43.500
 certainly a little finer to see 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:45.190
 compared to the classic pistore 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.110
 so when the oil 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.930
 I put here and there of the living room e 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.430
 I can work comfortably if I need it 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:55.750
 something and did n't lose it 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:57.250
 to my beautiful sail door 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.860
 everything that books may need 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:01.750
 documents I had office folders 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:07.150
 inside all maybe all that 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:10.210
 I need and when I finished I close everything 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:18.520
 I would say hide after this gem 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:21.220
 in the other recording sail you are there 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:23.680
 in good hands I also say it 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:27.760
 I would say that because the phone rings 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.390
 did not win fighting a battery 

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.730
 this morning 

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:33.000
 I'm making a video that we feel 

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.000
 after
