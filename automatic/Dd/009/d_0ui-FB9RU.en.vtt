that<00:02:22.900> tie<00:02:23.110> into<00:02:23.530> our<00:02:23.770> different<00:02:24.190> subjects<00:02:24.640> and

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
that tie into our different subjects and

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.950 
that tie into our different subjects and
I<00:02:25.600> was<00:02:25.810> able<00:02:25.960> to<00:02:26.140> find<00:02:26.530> information<00:02:27.310> that<00:02:28.000> ties

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
I was able to find information that ties

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.960 
I was able to find information that ties
into<00:02:29.260> the<00:02:29.440> common<00:02:29.770> core<00:02:29.980> from<00:02:30.220> my<00:02:30.400> standards

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
into the common core from my standards

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.960 
into the common core from my standards
and<00:02:31.270> it<00:02:31.450> was<00:02:31.600> incredibly<00:02:32.500> easy<00:02:33.100> we<00:02:33.670> can<00:02:33.700> do<00:02:33.940> a

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
and it was incredibly easy we can do a

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.840 
and it was incredibly easy we can do a
whole<00:02:34.060> group<00:02:34.390> discussion<00:02:35.200> based<00:02:35.590> on<00:02:35.860> our<00:02:36.250> Bill

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
whole group discussion based on our Bill

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.550 
whole group discussion based on our Bill
of<00:02:36.880> Rights<00:02:37.030> and<00:02:37.570> then<00:02:38.050> we<00:02:38.230> can<00:02:38.410> do<00:02:38.530> a

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
of Rights and then we can do a

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.830 
of Rights and then we can do a
journaling<00:02:39.100> project<00:02:39.610> on<00:02:39.790> it<00:02:40.000> and<00:02:40.240> then<00:02:40.420> we<00:02:40.630> can

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
journaling project on it and then we can

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.800 
journaling project on it and then we can
take<00:02:41.050> it<00:02:41.110> into<00:02:41.380> the<00:02:42.040> computer<00:02:42.490> lab<00:02:42.520> and<00:02:43.090> get

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
take it into the computer lab and get

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.650 
take it into the computer lab and get
some<00:02:44.290> application<00:02:45.100> with<00:02:45.610> that<00:02:45.820> so<00:02:46.209> the

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
some application with that so the

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.740 
some application with that so the
students<00:02:46.990> can<00:02:47.290> become<00:02:48.220> lawyers<00:02:48.820> you<00:02:49.450> get

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
students can become lawyers you get

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.490 
students can become lawyers you get

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
rewarded not not only in the game but

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.170 
rewarded not not only in the game but
with<00:02:53.680> yourself<00:02:54.190> because<00:02:54.520> you<00:02:54.640> put<00:02:54.820> yourself

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
with yourself because you put yourself

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.690 
with yourself because you put yourself
in<00:02:55.300> that<00:02:55.390> mindset<00:02:55.600> like<00:02:56.170> you<00:02:56.380> can<00:02:56.590> do<00:02:56.770> it<00:02:56.800> the

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
in that mindset like you can do it the

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.910 
in that mindset like you can do it the
students<00:02:58.090> learn<00:02:58.240> how<00:02:58.270> to<00:02:58.450> think<00:02:58.930> you<00:02:59.560> learn
