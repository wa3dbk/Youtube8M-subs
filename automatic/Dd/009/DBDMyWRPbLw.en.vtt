00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:04.220 

so<00:00:02.010> here<00:00:02.250> we<00:00:02.399> have<00:00:02.429> the<00:00:02.820> app<00:00:03.000> currently<00:00:03.899> it's

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
so here we have the app currently it's

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.170 
so here we have the app currently it's
connected<00:00:04.680> to<00:00:04.710> the<00:00:04.950> kick<00:00:05.160> and<00:00:05.370> we<00:00:05.670> can<00:00:05.910> change

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
connected to the kick and we can change

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.690 
connected to the kick and we can change
the<00:00:06.420> colors<00:00:06.779> as<00:00:06.960> we<00:00:07.080> like<00:00:07.290> with<00:00:07.710> used<00:00:08.130> using

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
the colors as we like with used using

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.330 
the colors as we like with used using
the<00:00:08.820> screen<00:00:09.269> over<00:00:09.660> here<00:00:09.920> so<00:00:10.920> you<00:00:10.950> can<00:00:11.160> succeed

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
the screen over here so you can succeed

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.480 
the screen over here so you can succeed
at<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:11.880> color<00:00:12.120> changing<00:00:12.780> as<00:00:12.900> well<00:00:13.309> might<00:00:14.309> be<00:00:14.460> a

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
at the color changing as well might be a

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.210 
at the color changing as well might be a
bit<00:00:14.759> blown<00:00:15.000> out<00:00:15.269> in<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.870> video<00:00:16.230> but<00:00:16.800> I<00:00:16.859> can

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
bit blown out in the video but I can

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.540 
bit blown out in the video but I can
clearly<00:00:17.490> see<00:00:17.760> different<00:00:18.270> colors<00:00:19.550> when

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
clearly see different colors when

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.090 
clearly see different colors when
sleeping<00:00:20.939> around<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.660> you're<00:00:22.590> there<00:00:22.980> are

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
sleeping around and you're there are

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:29.179 
sleeping around and you're there are
some<00:00:23.279> preset<00:00:23.760> white<00:00:24.000> balances<00:00:27.500> on<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.980> left

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
some preset white balances on the left

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.389 
some preset white balances on the left
we<00:00:29.400> can<00:00:29.609> cook<00:00:29.939> toggle<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.949> different<00:00:31.949> cakes<00:00:32.189> if

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
we can cook toggle to different cakes if

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.220 
we can cook toggle to different cakes if
we<00:00:32.579> have<00:00:32.759> them<00:00:33.030> connected<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:33.719> don't<00:00:33.930> have<00:00:34.079> I'm

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
we have them connected I don't have I'm

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.830 
we have them connected I don't have I'm
sure<00:00:34.500> I<00:00:34.680> just<00:00:35.040> have<00:00:35.250> one<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:35.760> we<00:00:36.390> can<00:00:36.540> adjust

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
sure I just have one and we can adjust

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.670 
sure I just have one and we can adjust
the<00:00:37.260> brightness<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.300> kick<00:00:39.300> with<00:00:40.290> this<00:00:40.469> one

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
the brightness of the kick with this one

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.950 
the brightness of the kick with this one
so<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.520> can<00:00:41.579> see<00:00:41.820> here<00:00:42.090> if<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.360> just<00:00:42.809> the

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
so you can see here if I just the

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.229 
so you can see here if I just the
brightness<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:44.309> I<00:00:44.430> scroll<00:00:44.910> through<00:00:45.149> the

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
brightness and I scroll through the

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.470 
brightness and I scroll through the
colors<00:00:45.539> you<00:00:45.690> can<00:00:45.840> clearly<00:00:46.260> see<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.649> bit

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
colors you can clearly see it a bit

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.950 
colors you can clearly see it a bit
we're<00:00:48.480> currently<00:00:48.719> at<00:00:48.960> 160<00:00:49.739> s<00:00:49.800> of<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.960> shutter

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
we're currently at 160 s of a shutter

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.900 
we're currently at 160 s of a shutter
speed<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:52.710> can<00:00:52.920> really<00:00:53.129> see<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.460> bit<00:00:53.879> of

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
speed and I can really see a bit of

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.939 
speed and I can really see a bit of
banding<00:00:54.719> when<00:00:54.870> strolling<00:00:55.350> through<00:00:55.800> two

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
banding when strolling through two

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.709 
banding when strolling through two
different<00:00:56.370> colors<00:00:59.210> it's<00:01:00.210> already<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.570> bit

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
different colors it's already a bit

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.609 
different colors it's already a bit
obvious<00:01:02.300> when<00:01:03.300> it's<00:01:03.899> putting<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.350> on<00:01:04.589> the

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
obvious when it's putting it on the

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.270 
obvious when it's putting it on the
higher<00:01:05.010> brightness<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:07.040> banding<00:01:08.040> is<00:01:08.130> not

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
higher brightness the banding is not

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.030 
higher brightness the banding is not
visible<00:01:08.720> so<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:10.200> banding<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.680> clearly<00:01:10.920> a

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
visible so the banding is clearly a

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.370 
visible so the banding is clearly a
problem<00:01:11.549> when<00:01:11.820> we're<00:01:12.170> shooting<00:01:13.170> with<00:01:13.350> a

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
problem when we're shooting with a

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.170 
problem when we're shooting with a
higher<00:01:13.950> shutter<00:01:14.340> speed<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:14.970> low

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
higher shutter speed and a low

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.440 
higher shutter speed and a low
brightness<00:01:15.740> this<00:01:16.740> in<00:01:17.040> in<00:01:17.580> practice<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.299> would

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
brightness this in in practice it would

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.240 
brightness this in in practice it would
not<00:01:18.659> be<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:18.960> combination<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:19.860> would<00:01:20.009> make

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
not be a combination that you would make

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.399 
not be a combination that you would make
you<00:01:20.970> would<00:01:21.119> have<00:01:21.270> maximum<00:01:21.750> brightness<00:01:21.930> in<00:01:22.350> a

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
you would have maximum brightness in a

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.780 
you would have maximum brightness in a
higher<00:01:22.560> shutter<00:01:22.920> speed<00:01:23.250> not<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.490> lower

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
higher shutter speed not a lower

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.530 
higher shutter speed not a lower
brightness<00:01:24.090> and<00:01:25.460> and<00:01:27.229> higher<00:01:28.229> shows<00:01:28.590> repeat

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
brightness and and higher shows repeat

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.270 
brightness and and higher shows repeat
we<00:01:30.540> have<00:01:30.570> some<00:01:30.900> magic<00:01:31.439> tricks<00:01:31.590> as<00:01:31.950> they<00:01:32.100> would

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
we have some magic tricks as they would

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.450 
we have some magic tricks as they would
say<00:01:32.310> in<00:01:32.520> some<00:01:33.270> here<00:01:33.829> so<00:01:34.829> here<00:01:35.040> we<00:01:35.159> can<00:01:35.189> have

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
say in some here so here we can have

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.670 
say in some here so here we can have
some<00:01:35.610> preset<00:01:36.090> colors<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.890> we<00:01:37.890> have<00:01:38.100> some<00:01:38.540> yeah

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
some preset colors and we have some yeah

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.160 
some preset colors and we have some yeah
some<00:01:40.680> light<00:01:40.920> effects<00:01:41.400> for<00:01:42.210> example<00:01:42.299> we<00:01:42.840> can<00:01:43.020> do

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
some light effects for example we can do

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.930 
some light effects for example we can do
the<00:01:44.149> rainbow<00:01:45.149> one<00:01:45.860> so

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:49.940 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.330 

see<00:01:50.630> here<00:01:50.870> let's<00:01:51.200> change<00:01:51.680> include<00:01:52.100> all<00:01:52.310> the

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
see here let's change include all the

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:59.860 
see here let's change include all the
color<00:01:52.640> different<00:01:53.270> colors<00:01:53.540> and<00:01:58.690> we<00:01:59.690> can

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
color different colors and we can

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.320 
color different colors and we can
improve<00:02:00.290> it<00:02:00.590> we<00:02:00.620> can<00:02:00.920> quick<00:02:01.130> speed<00:02:01.610> up<00:02:01.790> cycle

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
improve it we can quick speed up cycle

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.010 
improve it we can quick speed up cycle
as<00:02:02.420> well<00:02:04.060> there's<00:02:05.060> for<00:02:05.300> example<00:02:05.330> there's<00:02:05.840> also

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
as well there's for example there's also

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:14.220 
as well there's for example there's also
the<00:02:06.670> strobe<00:02:07.670> effect<00:02:12.460> turning<00:02:13.460> off<00:02:13.610> and<00:02:13.880> on

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
the strobe effect turning off and on

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.130 
the strobe effect turning off and on
repeatedly<00:02:15.850> as<00:02:16.850> you<00:02:17.030> can<00:02:17.180> see<00:02:17.420> that<00:02:17.600> I'm

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
repeatedly as you can see that I'm

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.010 
repeatedly as you can see that I'm
adjusting<00:02:18.620> the<00:02:19.040> parameters<00:02:19.220> a<00:02:19.670> bit<00:02:20.020> sometimes

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
adjusting the parameters a bit sometimes

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.200 
adjusting the parameters a bit sometimes
I<00:02:21.200> don't<00:02:21.410> have<00:02:21.650> an<00:02:21.770> idea<00:02:22.490> why<00:02:22.820> it<00:02:22.880> so<00:02:23.090> it's

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.210 
I don't have an idea why it so it's

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.710 
I don't have an idea why it so it's
working<00:02:23.570> at<00:02:23.630> the<00:02:23.750> moment<00:02:24.760> but<00:02:25.760> yeah<00:02:26.000> that's

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
working at the moment but yeah that's

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.150 
working at the moment but yeah that's
currently<00:02:27.200> there<00:02:27.440> the<00:02:27.890> stages<00:02:28.280> of<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.520> app<00:02:30.160> so

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
currently there the stages of the app so

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.850 
currently there the stages of the app so
this<00:02:31.460> is<00:02:31.490> the<00:02:31.700> presets<00:02:32.270> colors<00:02:33.170> you<00:02:33.560> can<00:02:33.740> also

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
this is the presets colors you can also

adjust<00:02:34.220> the<00:02:34.550> rats<00:02:34.820> individually<00:02:35.600> or

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
adjust the rats individually or

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.620 
adjust the rats individually or
something<00:02:36.080> like<00:02:36.170> that<00:02:36.230> you<00:02:36.470> can<00:02:36.830> have<00:02:37.700> an

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.770 

color<00:02:41.630> like<00:02:42.230> this<00:02:42.260> and<00:02:42.940> for<00:02:43.940> the<00:02:44.030> rest<00:02:44.240> yeah

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
color like this and for the rest yeah

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.080 
color like this and for the rest yeah
it's<00:02:45.320> quite<00:02:45.890> obvious<00:02:46.070> yep<00:02:46.900> like<00:02:47.900> I<00:02:48.050> said<00:02:49.090> what

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
it's quite obvious yep like I said what

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.030 
it's quite obvious yep like I said what
I<00:02:50.120> find<00:02:50.570> that<00:02:50.660> quite<00:02:50.720> annoying<00:02:51.200> is<00:02:51.440> that<00:02:51.470> it

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
I find that quite annoying is that it

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.660 
I find that quite annoying is that it
automatically<00:02:53.030> turns<00:02:53.330> on<00:02:53.600> the<00:02:53.750> camera<00:02:54.520> as<00:02:55.520> you

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
automatically turns on the camera as you

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.030 
automatically turns on the camera as you
can<00:02:55.760> see<00:02:55.940> here<00:02:58.540> just<00:02:59.540> one<00:02:59.720> last<00:03:00.350> remark<00:03:00.739> and

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
can see here just one last remark and

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.750 
can see here just one last remark and
what<00:03:01.970> is<00:03:02.090> quite<00:03:02.300> funny<00:03:02.720> is<00:03:02.930> that<00:03:02.959> you<00:03:03.260> can<00:03:03.760> set

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
what is quite funny is that you can set

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.900 
what is quite funny is that you can set
the<00:03:05.000> colors<00:03:06.880> by<00:03:07.880> yourself<00:03:08.320> so<00:03:09.320> what<00:03:09.470> you<00:03:09.590> do<00:03:09.739> is

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
the colors by yourself so what you do is

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.970 
the colors by yourself so what you do is
you<00:03:10.910> see<00:03:11.300> you<00:03:11.720> set<00:03:11.989> then<00:03:12.350> the<00:03:12.530> color<00:03:12.770> is

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
you see you set then the color is

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.870 
you see you set then the color is
similar<00:03:14.290> so<00:03:15.290> what<00:03:15.709> you<00:03:15.830> do<00:03:15.980> is<00:03:16.010> you<00:03:16.430> select<00:03:16.790> a

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
similar so what you do is you select a

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.000 
similar so what you do is you select a
color<00:03:17.090> it<00:03:17.330> tap<00:03:17.540> it<00:03:17.750> on<00:03:17.900> on<00:03:18.170> it<00:03:18.440> and<00:03:18.709> then<00:03:18.860> it

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
color it tap it on on it and then it

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.590 
color it tap it on on it and then it
will<00:03:19.959> select<00:03:20.959> that<00:03:21.140> color<00:03:21.380> to<00:03:21.650> change<00:03:21.980> to<00:03:22.250> kick

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
will select that color to change to kick

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.080 
will select that color to change to kick
um<00:03:23.600> yeah<00:03:24.530> that<00:03:24.830> that's<00:03:25.130> basically<00:03:25.610> the<00:03:25.730> kick

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
um yeah that that's basically the kick

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.480 
um yeah that that's basically the kick
in<00:03:26.239> a<00:03:26.330> nutshell<00:03:28.480> yeah
