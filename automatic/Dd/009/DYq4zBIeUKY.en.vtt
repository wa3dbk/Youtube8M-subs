00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
same moves and weights life actually

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.509 
same moves and weights life actually
yeah<00:04:17.209> not<00:04:17.570> very<00:04:17.600> strong<00:04:18.109> welcome<00:04:18.590> but<00:04:19.130> many

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
yeah not very strong welcome but many

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:25.379

people<00:04:19.639> like<00:04:20.060> to<00:04:20.269> what<00:04:21.229> used<00:04:21.620> to<00:04:21.739> simply<00:04:22.190> be<00:04:22.490> so

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:25.389 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:29.760 

okay<00:04:26.389> then<00:04:26.990> last<00:04:27.410> one<00:04:27.770> at<00:04:27.949> best<00:04:28.340> on<00:04:28.820> my<00:04:29.270> opinion

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
okay then last one at best on my opinion

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.260 
okay then last one at best on my opinion
actually<00:04:30.770> I<00:04:30.800> think<00:04:31.039> rates<00:04:31.520> are<00:04:31.639> they<00:04:31.789> still<00:04:32.120> go

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
actually I think rates are they still go

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:34.779 
actually I think rates are they still go
it's<00:04:32.870> still<00:04:33.080> better<00:04:33.289> because<00:04:34.190> way<00:04:34.490> to<00:04:34.550> death

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:34.789 
it's still better because way to death

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:37.980 
it's still better because way to death
but<00:04:35.180> this<00:04:36.139> is<00:04:36.260> quite<00:04:36.410> bad<00:04:36.710> is<00:04:36.889> looking<00:04:37.220> to<00:04:37.370> you
