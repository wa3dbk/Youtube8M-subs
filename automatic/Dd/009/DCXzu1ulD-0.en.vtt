00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.750
 hello how about friends of the new chat and 

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:07.089
 welcome to a video more than promised 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:09.369
 it's debt here is another video and how 

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:12.309
 make economic disposable bases 

00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:15.609
 the bases are really needed when 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:19.420
 we go very far to decorate because to 

00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:22.090
 avoid the expense of going to pick them up and 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.340
 the client is more economical because 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.080
 its decoration in this case only 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:30.570
 I would have to charge whatever it cost them 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.570
 make these bases we start 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.499
 [Music] 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.900
 to make our voices disposable 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.900
 we need 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.350
 some little glasses of these of unicel of the 7 16 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.760
 those who use for meals that give them 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:28.450
 the castings or kitchens to carry 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:28.450
 from 7 16 with its lid 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:35.680
 we will need cement 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.659
 and obviously sand let's do the 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.960
 mix of cement with sand and a little 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:39.960
 of water 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:06.570
 since we have the mixture made 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.870
 you just have to pour the mixture in the 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.870
 stop 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:16.230
 that is totally full 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:19.879
 A) Yes 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.879
 now in colloquium in the stage 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.150
 and ready 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:37.160
 a kilo of cement must reach for 2 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.700
 little jets of these then in their 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.520
 calculations 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:44.290
 this time I made 10 for a 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.290
 decoration that we will see in another video 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.360
 since we are like success with its lid 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:58.209
 let's get rods from 316 is 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.670
 sold in hardware stores comes in a 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.440
 6 meter stretch on this occasion a 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:06.800
 cut into a section of a meter and a half 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:10.580
 of a rod can go to a 4 can 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:13.570
 a meter and cut 6 will these 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:16.850
 Dating bases are ideal for indoor 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:19.610
 and for a height no more than meter and 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.250
 medium because if they are rods of 2 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.650
 meters in the open although it is 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.020
 heavy the wind if it gets to flip 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.860
 there I would have to use one more fret 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:34.060
 big like this 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:36.070
 well a Chicana of water and if they are all 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.340
 the heaviest for a bow would have to 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:42.880
 buy a top of those like squares 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:45.580
 of 30 by 30 an equal container 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.440
 fill it with cement and they can make a 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.420
 thicker rod like this 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.370
 before putting the rod into the container 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:56.630
 they have to make a small hook 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:58.130
 like this a light one because because as 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.750
 the base was very heavy if you in 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.240
 one of those want to raise the 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.390
 inhalation this hook is going to come out the 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.430
 dipstick 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.900
 then this width will help us 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.620
 much 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:13.310
 now we put the rod in the fret 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.310
 the following way 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.030
 the lid has already marked an entry to 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:22.359
 center let's put where the 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.359
 hook 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:32.630
 that crosses 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.630
 center 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:39.660
 and we're going to put it on the floor 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.860
 A) Yes 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.320
 and once dry it will be like this 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.220
 all right 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:03.139
