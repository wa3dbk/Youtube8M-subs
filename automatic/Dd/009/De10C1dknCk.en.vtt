00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 hi how about today get them the 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.040
 best lock screens for 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.790
 android 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.780
 let's start with 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.780
 no end 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.200
 steve and it's not rather 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:27.720
 it's not a screen lock in form but 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.420
 is a widget type that is put in the 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.300
 lock screen that teaches us the 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.570
 notifications that we have 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.200
 all right 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.150
 exists 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.840
 down here all the 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:45.230
 saw notifications 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:49.000
 just get the message and appears and 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.000
 It is without any kind of notification 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.550
 and 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:01.310
 the second 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:01.310
 they write what is called light lab 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.790
 slate loc 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:14.860
 does almost the same as the other 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:18.060
 only that she occupies her own interface 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.460
 and things like that for example this is the view 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.540
 here notifications appear 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:27.360
 same if we need to the left the 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.350
 we open and if on the right the 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.390
 we discard 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.520
 and if we give here in unblock let's go 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.200
 to the right we unblock the 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.560
 device and we enter the screen 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.560
 normal 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:46.920
 and finally we have an application of 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.920
 the ones I like the most that is cover 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:58.340
 what this does is give us access 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:01.610
 fast to applications depending 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:07.460
 from a specific place we have the mode 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:11.560
 working in home mode car mode and 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.560
 are applications related to the use 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:18.100
 and the most important thing of this application 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.630
 is that they see if we give here 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.730
 and we started to slide towards 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.730
 left opens at that time and it was 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.220
 let's try another one for example 

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:29.830
 gmail 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.050
 it opens 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:35.880
 and if we jump 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:39.080
 we already have open and it's normal 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.080
 well let's see the new 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.580
 come on with other settings 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.160
 look 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:53.550
 really this blockade 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.670
 It is one of the best taught and very useful 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.670
 also 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:05.480
 well we have here in the play state the 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:09.470
 application cover is free the can 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:12.459
 download has a weight of 21 megs a 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.459
 little heavy good 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.450
 an average of 4.4 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.450
 it's good 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.120
 is light lock 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:29.280
 it is also free 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:33.440
 this weighs 5 mb 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.440
 and with an average of 4 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:39.660
 I noticed 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.660
 notifi also exploits 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.750
 has 9 10 37 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.580
 although it really is very useful and has a 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.580
 1.2 megabytes weight 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:56.160
 really all these three applications 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:58.860
 They are useful and not based on the aesthetic 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.390
 but the functional thing I hope has them 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.310
 liked 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:06.840
 biden I put it in like my video 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.840
 thank you until next time
