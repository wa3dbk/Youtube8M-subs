might be able to win that offense and
let's<00:04:56.960> say<00:04:57.080> it's<00:04:57.199> 23<00:04:57.740> and<00:04:58.090> you<00:04:59.090> know<00:04:59.210> whoever

let's say it's 23 and you know whoever
has<00:05:00.169> the<00:05:00.289> most<00:05:00.380> kills<00:05:00.710> as<00:05:00.919> defense<00:05:01.310> at<00:05:01.460> the<00:05:01.580> end

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:01.699 
has the most kills as defense at the end

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:03.640 
has the most kills as defense at the end
on<00:05:01.880> 33<00:05:02.389> so<00:05:02.900> if<00:05:03.020> you<00:05:03.080> just<00:05:03.199> run<00:05:03.349> up<00:05:03.470> the<00:05:03.560> middle

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
on 33 so if you just run up the middle

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.800 
on 33 so if you just run up the middle
