00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
metal screws in their rims to keep the

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.010 
metal screws in their rims to keep the
rim<00:01:23.670> from<00:01:23.850> slipping<00:01:24.270> what<00:01:24.780> are<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.899> benefits

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
rim from slipping what are the benefits

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.870 
rim from slipping what are the benefits
of<00:01:25.289> a<00:01:25.380> bead<00:01:25.530> lock<00:01:25.709> well<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.459> we<00:01:26.640> know<00:01:26.670> we've

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
of a bead lock well that we know we've

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.430 
of a bead lock well that we know we've
progressed<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.300> long<00:01:27.479> way<00:01:27.630> since<00:01:27.929> then<00:01:27.990> I<00:01:28.140> think

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
progressed a long way since then I think

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.930 
progressed a long way since then I think
weld<00:01:28.619> actually<00:01:29.039> probably<00:01:29.250> produces<00:01:29.759> more

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
weld actually probably produces more

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.219 
weld actually probably produces more
beadlock<00:01:30.360> wheels<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.899> all<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.110> other

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
beadlock wheels and all the other

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.469 
beadlock wheels and all the other
manufacturers<00:01:32.009> combined<00:01:32.490> so<00:01:33.030> we<00:01:33.119> have<00:01:33.209> a<00:01:33.240> lot

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
manufacturers combined so we have a lot

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.230 
manufacturers combined so we have a lot
of<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.810> lot<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.619> know<00:01:34.649> technical<00:01:35.280> expertise

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
you know the bead lock is just there to

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.480 
you know the bead lock is just there to
make<00:01:42.300> sure<00:01:42.509> that<00:01:42.990> all<00:01:43.229> of<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.920> all<00:01:44.220> of<00:01:44.250> the
