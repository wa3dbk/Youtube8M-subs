well<00:01:36.539> first<00:01:36.899> we<00:01:37.170> should<00:01:37.259> talk<00:01:37.530> about<00:01:37.859> which

00:01:38.029 --> 00:01:38.039 
well first we should talk about which

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:40.389 
well first we should talk about which
engine<00:01:38.310> to<00:01:38.609> go<00:01:38.759> for<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.539> best<00:01:39.810> one<00:01:40.079> is<00:01:40.319> the

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
engine to go for the best one is the

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:43.609 
engine to go for the best one is the

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
the corners and there's not much

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.290 
say a Ford Focus estate is far more
engaging<00:02:18.989> to<00:02:19.230> drive<00:02:19.620> in<00:02:20.069> fairness<00:02:20.790> the

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
engaging to drive in fairness the

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.540 
engaging to drive in fairness the
hatchback<00:02:21.540> was<00:02:22.019> the<00:02:22.230> same<00:02:22.530> so<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:22.980> extra

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
hatchback was the same so the extra

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.280 
hatchback was the same so the extra
weight<00:02:23.819> and<00:02:24.120> length<00:02:24.330> hasn't<00:02:24.840> made<00:02:25.019> it<00:02:25.170> any

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
weight and length hasn't made it any

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:38.380 
weight and length hasn't made it any
worse<00:02:25.620> to<00:02:25.980> drive

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.780 

it's<00:02:39.390> major<00:02:39.780> selling<00:02:40.319> point<00:02:40.620> should<00:02:40.950> be<00:02:41.010> more

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
it's major selling point should be more

it's major selling point should be more

space and yes I am going to complain
about<00:02:44.549> the<00:02:44.760> size<00:02:45.030> of<00:02:45.239> the<00:02:45.330> boot

although Chevrolet have managed to make

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.490 
although Chevrolet have managed to make
this<00:02:47.909> completely<00:02:48.269> flat<00:02:48.720> so<00:02:48.900> it's<00:02:49.019> easy<00:02:49.260> to

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
this completely flat so it's easy to

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.500 
this completely flat so it's easy to
