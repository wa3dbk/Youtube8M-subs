00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.609

 and jacky lemée each shampoo disappear age 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.650
 here it is still perceived very often I know it's not very complicated 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.710
 so I work with business jets 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.580

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.580

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.170

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.900
 I do not calculate too much I see a little bit 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:10.829
 that's dancing 

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:13.829
 it makes it worth it 

00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:19.569

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:45.859
 on the cbs string that 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:48.859
 I think it's difficult 

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:51.909
 rachid best 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:53.139
 masks 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:57.269
 it's hard to say so well when the temperature is higher than 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.139
 given so in fact 

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:01.909
 buy by Shiites for that I want 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:02.969
 one meter 

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:05.969
 I commit myself to anderlecht year one hour 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:10.289
 since yesterday 

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:14.029
 commitment to teasing hard work to do to have so by signing a 

00:03:14.029 --> 00:03:16.549
 local group of 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:18.919
 a good meal control 

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:21.919
 dubai jallet 3 

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:26.049
 three hours in oil soup career and two short haul 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:29.819
 here 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:32.819
 then we will clear all said the spokesman 

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:36.429
 this is an essay 

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:39.159
 if instead of young patriots 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:41.549
 Jeremy Michalak 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.179
 and percent 

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:45.039
 even if few 

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:48.039
 the accident was searching in the cemetery 

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:51.949
 unlike last year 

00:03:57.029 --> 00:04:00.029
 peugeot added m 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:17.669
 Why 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:20.909
 so we'll see the day 

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:23.909
 I'm trying to show what that gives 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.240
 it gives that 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.240
 so I range 

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:37.370
 this is Saint-Jacques district and create an account 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.370
 sochaux - Lille right after the match is racing 

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:45.110
 here are the girls needed a pretty short-term video to show a 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.150
 body sleeve and the ornate 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.979
 for the moment 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:52.349
 so here's a nice tribute to a control ap 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:54.719
 for me it is through this 

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:55.129
