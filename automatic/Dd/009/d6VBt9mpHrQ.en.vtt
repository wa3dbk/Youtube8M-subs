creating<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.259> balanced<00:01:23.040> life<00:01:23.869> which<00:01:24.869> of<00:01:25.049> course

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
creating a balanced life which of course

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.080 
creating a balanced life which of course
we've<00:01:25.500> heard<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.830> number<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.159> times<00:01:26.310> oh<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:26.759> need

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
we've heard a number of times oh I need

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.770 
we've heard a number of times oh I need
to<00:01:27.299> get<00:01:27.390> my<00:01:27.570> life<00:01:27.810> more<00:01:28.110> in<00:01:28.350> balance<00:01:28.650> but

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
to get my life more in balance but

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.340 
to get my life more in balance but
actually<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:30.990> balanced<00:01:31.619> life<00:01:31.950> isn't<00:01:32.700> something

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
actually a balanced life isn't something

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.920 
actually a balanced life isn't something
probably<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.920> we<00:01:35.100> really<00:01:35.579> want<00:01:35.930> meaning

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
probably that we really want meaning

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.890

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
when we balance our life we probably do

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.889 
when we balance our life we probably do
a<00:01:39.930> mediocre<00:01:40.530> job<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.340> doing<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.299> lot<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.540> things
