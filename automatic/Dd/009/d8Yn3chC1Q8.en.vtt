00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.710
 I grew blah lighting with my 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.840
 weekly commando program today 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.710
 we will talk about the tactics of the game on the map 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.860
 himmelsdorf 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.320
 and I will answer one common question which 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.289
 was quite often a bum in the last issue 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.449
 what is it worth taking everything so but about everything 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.449
 let's go in order 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:33.870
 Himmelsdorf map which causes 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.510
 twinge in pt in team combat and 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.720
 arts in a random house as always we have ours 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:44.309
 standard heavy setup in the face 4 of 3 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:46.920
 50100 1 and 2 Maltsov T1 and so one and the same 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.820
 how to send knowing the love of many 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.339
 tanks we send to banana knowingly 1 of 3 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.650
 on his maiden I want to note that of 3 not 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:58.769
 should go far and he should 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:00.660
 stand right by the wall and wait if 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:03.120
 strong rush on him whenever possible 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.820
 make one or two shots and drive off 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.610
 back slides or drive over the floor broken 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.830
 a building where he can live some more 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.140
 time and give the team the opportunity 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.060
 win if your wing is not 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.399
 the commander may send someone 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.289
 from forward to exploration and then already 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:22.380
 act on the circumstances to their 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:24.960
 maybe a few 50100 we send 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.420
 right on the center for it is optimal 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.640
 position if you go rush on a banana he 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.220
 you can make a couple of shots flying 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.920
 frags if it goes in the middle then it 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.440
 and see him and if opponents go on 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.810
 the left flank will be able to go center 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.300
 and start a war from there I mean it 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.060
 the task is not to join the straight frontal two 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.849
 and apply flank attacks through the center 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.700
 the rest of 3 must go to square d 

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:52.950
 3 or g3 depends on sharply 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.590
 if there is no enemy, then we become 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.959
 Christmas tree if they are, then it is desirable 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.099
 not getting damage first time this 

00:01:57.959 --> 00:02:04.530
 moment must act from 3 and 50100 

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:05.099
 p1 send 1 to another piece of iron 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.380
 slide 

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:10.500
 if opponents on one of the flanks are not 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.840
 there will be a challenge to take over and so 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.599
 let's see the main three options 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.000
 events first option rush on banana and 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.129
 if this happens then the choice is yours 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.319
 you can either go through the center and 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:24.360
 try to hold them either just 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.879
 unwrap by weight and meet their forehead in 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:29.280
 forehead at the time of departure they will 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:31.620
 disabled on the iso which stood in the defa 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.379
 and it will give you time for one or immediately 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.659
 two volleys of all your words and then 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:39.290
 work on the focus and actions of the commander on 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:41.640
 situations must end the battle by victory 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.069
 next option if main group 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.680
 from and meet all or most 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:49.319
 opponents can then be sent is-3 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.150
 who stood on duffy and 50100 on banana 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.640
 and right up to the base 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.440
 thereby pinching the enemy's tongs 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.519
 and you yourself will need to break the flank 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.410
 as soon as possible and last 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.360
 option if a team of opponents 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.610
 divided quite often it happens 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.920
 that at once two three tanks on a banana 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.799
 and one or two on the line of your triples 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.870
 then using the 50100 which roars 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:15.239
 literally center you must all together 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.459
 break the flank as soon as you are with him 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.860
 finish and need to fly immediately to the rescue 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.780
 banana which is possible and he will go to 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.739
 hangar by then but still you 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.680
 should be more 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.690
 and dust will have to win t1 must 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.420
 will win duels if they are 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.400
 and if the flank is free for them in any 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.709
 of cases try to break through to the base 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.349
 especially it should make the lad on 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:40.019
 the hill on this map from opponents can 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:40.980
 expect even rush down the hill but do it 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.799
 extremely rare 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.680
 for this is a very club, and since your 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:48.420
 p1 see this offensive and you can 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.810
 no problem go grab and for 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:54.389
 opponent it will be a complete fiasco the whole 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.459
 This is a very difficult tactic from the first 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:59.010
 times especially with the team not too 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:01.530
 played it is far from being a fact 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.870
 but if you learn her a little 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.090
 use then most wins will 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.220
 yours and want to make a little attention 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.560
 on the fact that the commander must himself understand 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.599
 what and how to do if something went wrong 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.970
 There are quite a few plans for this map. 

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:16.829
 scenarios and you yourself 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.229
 must learn to understand how you feel better 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:22.470
 do essentially i give you the most 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:23.280
 convenient launch pad further everything in 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.820
 your hands 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.440
 Well, on this tactic all I wanted now 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.120
 would discuss a little comment to 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.010
 last release sso command 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.620
 firstly quite a few people 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.570
 asked whether to take this tank or 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.240
 combine these two tanks 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.910
 I tried to answer these questions but 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.020
 I want to add a little bit all the same commander 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.030
 he is the head of everything 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.789
 it is he who decides who to take to the team 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.740
 or not i stick to the fact that tanks 

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:51.030
 must be equal in any case by 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.790
 characteristics of a friend 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.500
 to a friend since you are one and 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.170
 exactly you should work 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:01.080
 drive and have about the same 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:04.260
 damage for example, I clearly know what I knew 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.750
 4 iskris breaks you is similar 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.540
 top three instantly if you get a hodgepodge 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.250
 this effect may disappear 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.690
 also a lot of people wrote about what was needed 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.940
 take t32 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.430
 he will be able to help up the glasses or 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.950
 all sorts of difficult places it really 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.960
 so but he is not as dynamic as is-3 and 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:24.150
 when maneuvering on the map he will either 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.490
 delay the command or come 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:28.650
 late to the battlefield what could be 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.380
 fatal truth I think 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.780
 from 3 tank which is the best on 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:36.930
 level eight and replace it with the same 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:39.120
 t32 for me does not make sense but it is for 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.310
 me if you like you can 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.500
 try to take it but I won back 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.690
 the usual heavy setup you 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:48.030
 see in each release the sso command already 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.840
 a lot of fights and for me he is 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.910
 ideal 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.370
 if you find yours then i will only 

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:55.980
 glad to hear it in the comments and on 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:58.410
 Today I have everything with you was Yaroslav

 Dear friends
