00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:42.170
 hello this video tutorial I register 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:45.440
 because I saw a photo tutorial 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:49.100
 on facebook I also tell you where I have it 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:53.420
 seen on creative girlfriends who is a 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:57.050
 facebook page and always give them a lot 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:59.930
 ideas so much the tutorials is only photographic 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:03.500
 so don't give video tutorials then 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:08.840
 co looking on youtube seeing if ce 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:11.210
 they were of this type I realized 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.960
 that there were n't any video tutorials on 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:18.560
 this little gem so I decided to 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:22.850
 record one myself then if someone does 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:26.360
 were to feel offended or felt the 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.399
 owner of the invented jewel that 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.039
 I mean you can do can do 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:34.429
 therefore anyone is not a is not 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:38.360
 recorded that you can't make it reproduce 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:42.409
 in short, it is still apple warns me below 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:47.750
 in the comments or if I consider it necessary 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:50.960
 at the ulvi hotel since then the piercing in 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:55.369
 this is not the issue is the pitching 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:58.909
 in question is this here it is 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:01.240
 you see decorated with a b cone color 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:01.240
 silver 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:08.090
 you see that it is very nice not from here 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.759
 detaches because it is firm and is really 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:13.489
 simple and also not bad at all 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:16.370
 that is very delicate does not bother 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:18.620
 to see a sight in short does not give 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.180
 has also worn this is 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.450
 a very important thing 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:27.650
 I realized this here the thread of 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:31.299
 silver plated copper then 8 mm of 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:35.630
 diameter so it's very up and not a 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:41.049
 I don't know how excessive it is 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:41.049
 if you see another one 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.600
 which is instead normal without the 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.900
 jewel cone book decoration 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.940
 of the crystal's own 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.460
 so this is the simple version 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:03:01.670
 this is the decorated version and I have 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:05.590
 also realized this here with the 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:11.150
 red alley and that of the video tutorial 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:14.330
 which is this with the green bic 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:17.620
 emerald green emerald for hope 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:20.330
 hope in 2013 better then 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:24.410
 very long introduction to tutorial two 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:26.600
 minutes and 57 so we better go 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.990
 to see how this thing is done and what 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.990
 we need it 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:37.610
 how it gets you excuse the equipment for 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:40.580
 this tutorial will be about crystals b 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:44.180
 cone or half crystals in this 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:47.989
 case, however, of a b cone with in e 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:52.489
 we will only use one then I have a pearl 

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:56.120
 your choice of wire this 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:57.940
 0.8 mm silver plated copper wire 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.760
 thick 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:04.610
 will serve for the addition of the 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:07.239
 decoration with the bie cono or in the middle 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:12.580
 crystal a bead will serve a 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:12.580
 nail with round tip 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:21.890
 then they will need pliers with tips 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:23.450
 cones that is the trick and finally a 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.930
 ruler 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:30.710
 let's see how this is accomplished 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:36.220
 do it yourself piercing we take the thread of 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:38.810
 copper and we measure a length of 6.5 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:42.800
 centimeters then now with the pliers 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:47.870
 tips cones that we are going to bend 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:50.390
 one end more or less to a third 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:54.050
 of length 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:56.750
 now we do it too 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:59.270
 on the other hand we must do this 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.580
 create two us all in and at two 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.889
 ends so that they arrive 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:10.069
 here in the center then we cut one more 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:12.889
 ok, now let's take it with pliers e 

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:14.960
 let's create 2 asoli in my whole party 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:19.580
 this is the result 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:21.560
 let's roll it up to fold then 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:25.009
 I take bridge cones with pliers here 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:29.900
 at the bottom or do a little like vi 

00:05:25.009 --> 00:05:35.419
 you find better and I go to give him a turn 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:38.060
 so the same thing I do on the other 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:41.599
 now these two islands we must 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:48.500
 you have to see that they are crooked we must 

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:51.650
 having them in line with the whole thing is what 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:54.770
 here the straightened one sees instead 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:56.360
 that still oblique then we straighten 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:59.199
 that one too 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:02.900
 now we are going to prepare the crystal 

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:05.659
 to decorate in this piercing 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:08.199
 I decided to put a b cone color 

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:08.199
 Emerald 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:15.289
 then I put it in our pin with 

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:21.490
 the round head therefore also beautiful from 

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:21.490
 see and leave about an inch 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:28.960
 an inch away from the say 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:33.199
 we cut the excess with the cutter 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:35.210
 that we have died of the belief that 

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:38.740
 we can use it in another way 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:42.050
 here now we have to fold this 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:47.740
 this ends up to form the nose 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:47.740
 li na that the one we will need then for 

00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:58.750
 place our little crystal 

00:06:55.669 --> 00:06:58.750
 on our little gem 

00:06:58.969 --> 00:07:03.949
 ok wishing you can do this method 

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:05.869
 that is, on a simple giolina if you have it 

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:08.089
 afraid the dolina opens because 

00:07:05.869 --> 00:07:13.249
 however these pegs are light 

00:07:08.089 --> 00:07:15.799
 they are very fine then I advise 

00:07:13.249 --> 00:07:21.729
 to do one of noda hours ago hard fice 

00:07:15.799 --> 00:07:21.729
 or try to put the end on 

00:07:21.789 --> 00:07:28.189
 these ends here that I take 

00:07:25.999 --> 00:07:31.159
 with pliers try to insert it inside 

00:07:28.189 --> 00:07:33.619
 at bie cono making sure that vik or 

00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:36.169
 nano breaks 

00:07:33.619 --> 00:07:39.519
 these are simple p glass cones that 

00:07:36.169 --> 00:07:42.949
 I bought fimo from still beads 

00:07:39.519 --> 00:07:45.709
 which, however, seem to be true, they say here at 

00:07:42.949 --> 00:07:48.199
 this point we can position this 

00:07:45.709 --> 00:07:52.819
 little decoration wait for that 

00:07:48.199 --> 00:07:55.819
 they close a little better ok inside 

00:07:52.819 --> 00:07:57.649
 of one of the two lines and if desired 

00:07:55.819 --> 00:08:00.259
 they can insert many more 

00:07:57.649 --> 00:08:03.739
 however he obtained on a day e 

00:08:00.259 --> 00:08:05.360
 they never fell so I hope that 

00:08:03.739 --> 00:08:07.879
 you enjoyed this tutorial 

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:10.069
 so i greet you hope this video 

00:08:07.879 --> 00:08:13.689
 it was clear and you enjoyed it and there 

00:08:10.069 --> 00:08:13.689
 I'm waiting for the next hello video
