and choose between any of those weapons

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.390 
and choose between any of those weapons
to<00:01:35.159> really<00:01:35.369> create<00:01:35.520> their<00:01:35.729> own<00:01:35.759> hybrid<00:01:36.030> class

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
to really create their own hybrid class

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.249 
to really create their own hybrid class
so<00:01:38.400> i<00:01:38.430> wouldn't<00:01:38.820> say<00:01:38.909> have<00:01:39.030> a<00:01:39.090> native<00:01:39.930> favorite

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
so i wouldn't say have a native favorite

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.260 
so i wouldn't say have a native favorite
weapon<00:01:40.560> type<00:01:40.799> exactly<00:01:41.549> but<00:01:41.790> rather

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
weapon type exactly but rather

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.469 
weapon type exactly but rather
combinations<00:01:43.200> that<00:01:43.380> prefer<00:01:43.829> so<00:01:44.070> like<00:01:44.820> the

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
combinations that prefer so like the

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.149 
combinations that prefer so like the
glaive<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.229> bow<00:01:46.409> so<00:01:46.740> you<00:01:46.799> can<00:01:47.040> have

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
glaive and the bow so you can have

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.800 
glaive and the bow so you can have
something<00:01:47.399> that's<00:01:47.700> more<00:01:47.850> close<00:01:48.149> range<00:01:48.450> and

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
something that's more close range and

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.569 
something that's more close range and
then<00:01:49.140> or<00:01:49.350> something<00:01:49.890> its<00:01:49.979> range<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:50.490> can

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
then or something its range that you can

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.520 
then or something its range that you can
lure<00:01:51.240> them<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:52.020> then<00:01:52.110> finish<00:01:52.500> them

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
lure them to you and then finish them

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.520 
lure them to you and then finish them
off<00:01:52.799> once<00:01:53.070> they<00:01:53.250> close<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.790> distance<00:01:54.350> and<00:01:55.350> it

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
off once they close the distance and it

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.929 
off once they close the distance and it
really<00:01:55.770> depends<00:01:56.100> on<00:01:56.130> what<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.340> situation<00:01:56.610> is

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
really depends on what the situation is

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.090 
really depends on what the situation is
I<00:01:57.149> mean<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.509> can<00:01:57.689> if<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.590> want<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.860> fill<00:01:59.070> a

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
I mean you can if you want to fill a

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.980 
I mean you can if you want to fill a
more<00:01:59.369> support<00:01:59.820> oriented<00:02:00.450> role<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:00.840> can

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
more support oriented role you can

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.120 
more support oriented role you can
choose<00:02:01.140> something<00:02:01.350> like

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
choose something like

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.190 
choose something like
more<00:02:02.219> fans<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:03.090> if<00:02:03.810> you<00:02:03.930> want<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.140> be

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
more fans and if you want to be

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.359 
more fans and if you want to be
something<00:02:04.500> like<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.710> tank<00:02:04.950> you<00:02:05.130> can<00:02:05.159> choose

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
something like the tank you can choose

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:06.920 
something like the tank you can choose
the<00:02:05.399> gauntlet<00:02:05.880> so<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:06.299> really<00:02:06.420> just<00:02:06.600> depends

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
the gauntlet so it really just depends

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.290 
the gauntlet so it really just depends
