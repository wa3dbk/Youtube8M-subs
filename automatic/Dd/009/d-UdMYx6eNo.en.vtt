00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:06.799
 Pokemon is one of the franchises of 

00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:10.040
 nintendo that has been in the eye of 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:12.320
 thousands of scandals worldwide to 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.629
 few years after its creation and by 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.129
 the popularity came to say a lot 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:18.230
 that was a means by which 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.509
 video game companies could carry 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.020
 satanic messages to young minds 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:25.810
 more vulnerable 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.660
 if this were not enough already with the exit 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:32.110
 of an animated series circulated quickly 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:34.570
 the news that 685 children received 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.180
 epileptic seizures after watching the episode 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.640
 38 where the electrical attacks of 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.950
 pikachu produced a change of color 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.160
 intermittent that was very violent 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:47.080
 for the Japanese audience which although 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.809
 affected the growing fame of the 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.480
 franchise produced that this chapter will 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.949
 banned in several countries besides 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.770
 it was a pretext for the 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.660
 preacher josué and lyon diese to know 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.850
 his ignorance and his lies with the 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.260
 rest of the world 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.390
 and look for any of these 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.250
 demons with the phrases that is contained 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.020
 on the cards and take them to 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.590
 different areas of the occult of his 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.930
 mind this is a pokémon game is a 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.880
 I play each phrase and each word that is 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.720
 here of each letter that is an invocation 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.720
 to the devil 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.510
 within the games there are many 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.370
 theories and legends like that of the batik of 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.340
 Gary we already talked about in a video 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:30.280
 previous the town music the band and 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.440
 others we will talk about in the future 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.150
 however from among those stories 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.490
 who depend more on interpretation 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.500
 there are official data that have 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.770
 result to be of a somewhat nature 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.660
 disturbing even if you have some of 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.370
 these versions at hand you can 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.870
 verify the information that you 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.870
 I will share next 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.690
 since the start of the first game the 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.840
 Professor gives us a pokemon dexter or 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:03.000
 called simply as poker is a 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.860
 virtual encyclopedia that collects data from 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.200
 the pokemon that coaches go 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.090
 finding throughout his trip by 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.230
 what will show more information when 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.670
 see or through a new pokemon 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.730
 I really do not know if someone here does not know 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.250
 this but in order to capture certain 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.989
 pokemon the external one reveals certain 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.550
 data that make us doubt the 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.550
 innocence of this franchise 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.900
 in the silver version for example the 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.569
 brou if data tell us that remember 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.000
 all the dreams they eat that rarely 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.819
 as in adult dreams because those of the 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.489
 children are tastier 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.980
 in the ruby ​​version says if it gives you 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:47.230
 Itching in the nose while you sleep is 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.170
 signal that the dow if it's standing on 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:53.069
 your pillow trying to make your dreams come true 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.969
 for your nasal things 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:58.260
 his evolution is not going so well 

00:02:55.969 --> 00:03:00.780
 besides that in the green leaf version 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.840
 of fire red we find a girl in 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.780
 a forest being scared by a hymn 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:09.269
 its entrance in fire red says well charge 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.519
 a pendulum as a mechanism there was a 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:14.450
 incident in which I kidnapped a child to 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.450
 who had hypnotized 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.260
 in the case of cadabra the entries of the 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.780
 fire red and emerald are very 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.459
 similar and that roughly say 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.569
 that there was a child with powers 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:30.530
 extrasensory that one morning woke up 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.530
 become a corpse 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.439
 with which there was a remember the case of the 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:39.890
 pokemon tower in the red blue versions 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:41.989
 and yellow in the red fire version we 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:45.650
 he says he usually cries when he feels 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:48.220
 alone and that he uses on his head the skull of 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.220
 his mother 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.320
 in the sapphire version we can see the 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.140
 cardboard entry that goes up a 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:59.060
 little more of tone revealing to us that usually 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.550
 follow group travelers who 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:04.280
 they go into the desert waiting 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:07.360
 patiently to get tired and not 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.360
 can move 

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.410
 in the emerald version we have the 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.419
 pokemon banner whose entry reveals that 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:20.030
 it was a doll that was once thrown away 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:22.520
 the garbage and waiting since then 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.419
 full of resentment to the child who left him 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.419
 abandoned there 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.540
 the pokemon flames of white pokemon and 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:36.660
 Black has an entry that gives us a note 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:38.490
 that before was a human that his mask 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.950
 it reminds him of the face he had when 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.730
 He was alive and sometimes he cries 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.730
 contemplate it 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.880
 in the same version we have an entry 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.010
 very interesting in front of who is said 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.650
 he wanders in hospitals waiting for 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:57.230
 death of people to stay 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.889
 with your soul when it breaks away from 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:01.889
 her body 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:04.320
 is the pokemon that we see at the end of 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:07.500
 path 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.750
 more recently in pokemon and we were 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:12.690
 describes dry flow as a milestone that 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:15.210
 takes the souls to the other world that in 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.220
 sometimes it has even taken 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:21.560
 to children who held their arm 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.560
 believing that it was about balloons 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:28.490
 phantom of the same version reminds us 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.380
 to the previous entry because of these we 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:33.259
 says it's about the souls of the 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:35.210
 children who perished in the forest and who 

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:39.249
 they acquired this form by passing their 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:41.769
 last hours in the trunk of a tree 

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:44.019
 these were just some entries from 

00:05:41.769 --> 00:05:47.169
 the most disturbing and interesting of 

00:05:44.019 --> 00:05:48.999
 pokemon universe if you know 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:52.629

00:06:05.589 --> 00:06:08.369
 torture
