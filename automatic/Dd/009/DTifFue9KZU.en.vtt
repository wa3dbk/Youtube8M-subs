 previously seen in our videos in general 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.719
 talk a little about the car that we 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.270
 we plan to make cars are prepared by us 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.660
 my competition Russia 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:43.280
 mean on nutrition on nutrition we took 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.510
 4 batteries the door 95 ampere hours 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.340
 rise characteristic can be read in 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.610
 the Internet will not mind anything 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.860
 telling in general I pass with 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.180
 company affairs sponsored this this 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.829
 car six dvenashka me 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:03.030
 on the website they can watch go 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.979
 dvenashka this a sp12 series there strip 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.729
 a half kilowatt each 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:12.210
 amplifier we chose sandalwood we flee 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:15.500
 ZAZ 4 you 400000 and he bought me more 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.060
 about four years ago still plays 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.860
 then I would like to design 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.140
 to tell 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:24.150
 the decision is constructive that we made 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.659
 in this car first thing and piled 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.020
 frame 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.159
 which is attached to the bolts body 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.380
 so here are hex bolts 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.020
 embedded nuts which is pressed and 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.340
 in the back there are two things and on the other 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.150
 the sides are also two things 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:41.970
 so our frame is she so 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.840
 massive it turned out it is attached to 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.700
 back to the body I will say about the seat means 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.930
 Seat is divided into two parts in the first 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.700
 parts the second part we shot the first part 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:58.439
 the seats cut metal 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:01.399
 here you can see there is hot or frame from 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:04.049
 plywood MDF and on it 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:07.250
 installed a six-channel audison 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:09.959
 the processor here is the future we have wifi in 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.039
 in the future we will put here another tablet but this 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.810
 future plans 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.310
 and thus got the factory 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.879
 sidushka on the other side she is the same 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.450
 soft 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:20.250
 but it has amplifiers installed 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.769
 processors them always 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.769
 who deals with such installations us 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:27.480
 understand that they really always 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:31.409
 nowhere to put there is not enough space for them 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:35.159
 never battery solution means 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:35.670
 what we came up with with this 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:40.670
 corner 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.790
 we attached to the regular mount 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.379
 the seats 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.670
 welded to it frame under the battery and 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:50.370
 frame also secured 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.889
 and welded on one side fixed 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.840
 set on the other side of the frame under 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:56.939
 the battery is obtained here we are 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.639
 tried to sway together together 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:02.159
 with the car from the other side did exactly 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:05.970
 also in this way comes two 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:06.689
 battery on this side two more 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.430
 battery 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:16.739
 try to put the plus side between 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:19.530
 to gain a foothold 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.930
 a couple more batteries of this we have 4 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.419
 battery stand up here and do not interfere 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.340
 mean here between the battery below 

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:29.150
 we will soon have all the distributor 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:33.209
 power down 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:37.799
 here for now just wanted to talk about 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:43.159
 what's already done with the car and 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:47.310
 do here in general watch out for our maiden 

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:49.650
 we will see that we get the door 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:56.659
 By the way, we have doors now 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:56.659
 making at us you will give this up 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:05.590
 888 elf hordes 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:12.400
