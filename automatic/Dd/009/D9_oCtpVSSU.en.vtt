00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.809

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.550
 squash game recipes which is on 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.130
 I really like this moment because of 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.980
 that it is easy to prepare and 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.310
 pretty tasty that he for this 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.850
 need zucchini bulgarian pepper 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:36.690
 salt sugar vegetable oil 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:40.129
 Acetic essence tomato paste sharp 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:43.739
 ground red pepper and garlic 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:47.690
 let's start cooking for 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.579
 we will start on a finely grated garlic 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:55.579
 so we will do quite garlic which 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.579
 we have garlic we have prepared 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:02.489
 begin to prepare zucchini 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:05.030
 for this sanitas many take off completely 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.030
 peel 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.260
 Now you need to cut convenient for 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:19.710
 blender day or what case combine 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:24.130
 in chunks if there are already seeds in a zucchini 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:28.090
 seeds must be removed here so we will do 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:31.140
 all available zucchini and so here we are 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:36.840

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:41.650
 they need can not blender meat grinders 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:48.640
 the company is that you have it right there 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:51.850
 do we add Bulgarian pepper to our house? 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.940
 It should be such a homogeneous 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:58.750
 the mass that we will lay out in 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:01.320
 the pan is such a wonderful first 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:05.320
 became an hour of zucchini and bell peppers 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.400
 now we pour sugar in here 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.990

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.550
 wipe tomato flesh 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:33.540
 I use mostly mix 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.540

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.020
 stirring occasionally for half an hour 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.920
