00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 but that is the result so bulky 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.020
 but the difference of three goals does not 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.730
 exists in these two teams because it exists 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.929
 because why it happened not but what you 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.030
 they are to explain by how 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.500
 circumstances of the game that why 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.509
 What was it that was so exactly what 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.949
 happened because what was not previously 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.840
 they gave us a dance and we did not 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.189
 we saw today I played really well really 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.840
 they played well they did things well 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.090
 but I think we deserved a 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.640
 little more because Juan Carlos Toja is not 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.769
 is not a holder in this team I have been 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.359
 holder in the majority of departure this is 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.009
 the first game that I'm not 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.320
 owner I do not know by decision of the technician 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.820
 I really do not know why because there will not be 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.570
 started in this game but I 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.730
 he had been playing the 45 games that we have 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.469
 played this year the life of Juan Carlos 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.480
 all of the independent era 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.690
 santa fe the selection that came out champion 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.670
 to the juvenile in the coffee axis until 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.500
 study good there was a bit of everything 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.270
 comes after the selection after 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.340
 try faith went up was on river 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.930
 I did not play much, so I went to Dallas 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.920
 was here in the selection of the actions 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.579
 a few years ago 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.199
 where saying something important a 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:06.490
 important work I performed very well 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.630
 I felt very good there was in Europe 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:12.729
 for 45 years in Romania and in Greece and 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.790
 now again back here in the ms 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:18.670
 and when you are windows to how is 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.049
 now with the one of the revolution has seen 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.930
 some change in this league something progress 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:24.670
 yes, it is very clear, look at the network 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.500
 bulls already has its own stadium the 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.119
 most have the most teams have 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.390
 his own stadium that when I played 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:34.149
 there were 13 14 teams now and 18 10 and 19 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.159
 I think obviously the league has 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:37.869
 progressed a lot that now with many 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:39.369
 more players of much more name a lot 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.380
 more quality the league became much more 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.210
 competitive you are still in your 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.850
 colombia teammates of the 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.220
 time when they would continue to be a champion is 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.509
 al falcao yes clear they are all that 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.009
 they play now in the majors only 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:52.720
 that I follow him all the time from time to time 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:54.819
 when I keep in touch with them 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.619
 making them being a Colombian more 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:58.990
 every time the parties trying to 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.310
 encourage and make me happy when 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.860
 things are going well and sad obviously 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.660
 when it goes wrong because he came back from europe 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.040
 good was circumstances for the part 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.110
 economic in the team that was in 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.929
 Greece I do not know if in the situation that 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.210
 is presenting at that moment and 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.850
 economically it has been or is is 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.830
 terrible and that has affected in all 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.660
 areas also in the ies in a timely manner 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.400
 also in football so in the 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.720
 team that was on the lounge list and 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.340
 that will make me pay for a few months 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.690
 I tried to endure try to be there 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.920
 working doing my job but 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.750
 good luckily things do not 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.360
 they improved so everyone got to catch 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.860
 my bags and go and looking to see that 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.900
 It would be left me the opportunity View 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.060
 here again to the emergency so here 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.430
 we are and what do you intend in the future 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.860
 return to Colombia will return to the old 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.300
 continent the truth I do not know yet 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.130
 I would love to be again in 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.310
 europe I would be able to return to 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:51.489
 sing and be able to play again to play 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.230
 in Europe in the most competitive leagues 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.820
 of the world but well I think first 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.770
 I have to recover again 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.270
 physically you have to improve again 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.370
 soccer grasping a lot of rhythm 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.959
 because during a year of injuries 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.150
 also what happened with the aris that 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:06.280
 I was without equipment now what I tell you 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.930
 improve recover me start doing the 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.080
 things well to think about the next 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.030
 He passed 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:13.550
 teams that view the league m ls 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.960
 which has appeared good teams of a 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.790
 international level acceptable as 

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.080
 which I think are all very even 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.430
 but good the new york has very good 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.230
 radio very very good level or do not have 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.910
 retina great players the same the 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.310
 If desired, it is also very good 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.370
 team 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.930
 real salt lake also some equipment 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.640
 be interesting everyone has something something 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:34.690

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.690
