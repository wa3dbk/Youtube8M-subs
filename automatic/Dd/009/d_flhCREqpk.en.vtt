camera<00:03:29.239> did<00:03:36.760> ok<00:03:37.760> so<00:03:37.819> back<00:03:38.209> in<00:03:38.360> the<00:03:38.450> hop<00:03:38.569> and<00:03:39.519> you

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
camera did ok so back in the hop and you

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:44.440 
camera did ok so back in the hop and you
want<00:03:40.670> to<00:03:40.760> go<00:03:40.790> down<00:03:41.209> to<00:03:41.480> the<00:03:41.510> hollow<00:03:41.840> pad<00:03:43.450> that's
