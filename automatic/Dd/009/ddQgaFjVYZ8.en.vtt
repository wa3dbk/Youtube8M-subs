pretty well than that way straight

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.020 
pretty well than that way straight
through<00:00:51.680> it's<00:00:52.680> it's<00:00:53.039> German<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:53.730> it's<00:00:53.850> not<00:00:53.969> a

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
through it's it's German so it's not a

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
later than not that's probably know

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.899
