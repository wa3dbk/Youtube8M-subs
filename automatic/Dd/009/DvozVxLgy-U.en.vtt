work requires at least a painted
background<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:57.299> usually<00:01:57.810> at<00:01:57.960> least<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.500> know

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
background and usually at least you know

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.709 
background and usually at least you know
one<00:01:59.070> drawing<00:01:59.399> of<00:01:59.610> a<00:01:59.670> character<00:02:00.149> so<00:02:00.600> if<00:02:00.659> you

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
one drawing of a character so if you

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.510 
one drawing of a character so if you
have<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:00.869> lot<00:02:01.020> of<00:02:01.049> quick<00:02:01.409> cuts<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.009> quit<00:02:02.219> shots

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
have a lot of quick cuts and quit shots

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.700 
have a lot of quick cuts and quit shots
those<00:02:03.240> are<00:02:03.420> relatively<00:02:03.780> expensive<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:04.560> still

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
those are relatively expensive you still

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.050 
those are relatively expensive you still
have<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:04.890> draw<00:02:05.130> all<00:02:05.219> those<00:02:05.340> backgrounds<00:02:05.969> and

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
have to draw all those backgrounds and

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.089 
have to draw all those backgrounds and
and<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.810> characters<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.380> so<00:02:07.500> forth<00:02:07.799> so

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
and the characters and so forth so

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.600 
and the characters and so forth so
there's<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:08.970> preference<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:10.590> letting<00:02:11.459> your

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
there's a preference to letting your

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.430 
there's a preference to letting your
shots<00:02:11.879> count<00:02:12.050> generally<00:02:13.050> speaking<00:02:13.170> you're

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
shots count generally speaking you're

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.850 
shots count generally speaking you're
not<00:02:13.560> going<00:02:13.680> to

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
not going to

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.440 
not going to
see<00:02:13.950> a<00:02:13.980> lot<00:02:14.190> of<00:02:14.250> those<00:02:14.460> quick<00:02:14.730> cuts<00:02:14.970> except<00:02:15.330> in

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
see a lot of those quick cuts except in

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.580 
see a lot of those quick cuts except in
a<00:02:15.510> movie<00:02:15.750> where<00:02:15.870> they<00:02:15.930> have<00:02:16.110> a<00:02:16.140> higher<00:02:16.350> budget

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
a movie where they have a higher budget

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.020 
a movie where they have a higher budget
so<00:02:17.100> clearly<00:02:17.340> they<00:02:17.490> have<00:02:17.520> a<00:02:17.640> higher<00:02:17.850> budget

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
so clearly they have a higher budget

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.000 
so clearly they have a higher budget

that but that's a bit of a problem for

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.890 
that but that's a bit of a problem for
me<00:02:28.320> to<00:02:28.800> be<00:02:28.920> honest<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.910> movie<00:02:30.210> felt<00:02:30.510> a<00:02:30.690> little

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
me to be honest the movie felt a little

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.810 
me to be honest the movie felt a little
constrained<00:02:31.590> for<00:02:32.130> me<00:02:32.220> while<00:02:32.400> I<00:02:32.430> was<00:02:32.610> watching

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
constrained for me while I was watching

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.210 
constrained for me while I was watching
it<00:02:33.120> all<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.960> action<00:02:34.260> takes<00:02:34.530> place<00:02:34.620> in<00:02:35.040> and

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
it all the action takes place in and

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.620 
it all the action takes place in and
around<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:35.520> same<00:02:35.760> high<00:02:36.000> school<00:02:36.060> we're<00:02:36.480> all

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
used to and while watching I found

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.449 
used to and while watching I found
myself<00:02:39.530> wanting<00:02:40.530> to<00:02:40.680> go<00:02:40.830> somewhere<00:02:41.190> new<00:02:41.430> and

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
around there but it just it felt

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.590 
around there but it just it felt
constrained<00:02:49.320> it's<00:02:50.130> it<00:02:50.490> you<00:02:51.150> know<00:02:51.240> after

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
little claustrophobic um there were also

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.770 
little claustrophobic um there were also
times<00:03:02.370> where<00:03:02.760> honestly<00:03:03.120> I<00:03:03.180> want<00:03:03.420> to<00:03:03.480> kill<00:03:03.720> him

to<00:03:03.900> shut<00:03:04.170> up<00:03:04.370> I<00:03:05.510> mean<00:03:06.510> there's<00:03:06.870> always<00:03:07.200> been

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
to shut up I mean there's always been

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.960 
to shut up I mean there's always been
this<00:03:07.440> balancing<00:03:07.950> act<00:03:07.950> in<00:03:08.250> Haruhi<00:03:08.730> that<00:03:08.910> you

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
this balancing act in Haruhi that you

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.160 
this balancing act in Haruhi that you
can<00:03:09.090> just<00:03:09.209> see<00:03:09.390> things<00:03:09.690> from<00:03:09.840> kills

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
can just see things from kills

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.960 
can just see things from kills
perspective<00:03:10.709> and<00:03:10.860> hear<00:03:11.430> his<00:03:11.610> internal

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
perspective and hear his internal

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.690

monologue<00:03:12.450> and<00:03:12.680> sometimes<00:03:13.680> he's<00:03:14.370> working

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
monologue and sometimes he's working

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:15.920 
monologue and sometimes he's working
things<00:03:14.880> out<00:03:15.000> he's<00:03:15.209> kind<00:03:15.360> of<00:03:15.390> explaining

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
things out he's kind of explaining

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.030 
things out he's kind of explaining
things<00:03:16.110> for<00:03:16.590> you<00:03:16.800> and<00:03:18.260> you<00:03:19.260> know<00:03:19.350> the<00:03:19.799> show

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
things for you and you know the show

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.340 
things for you and you know the show
always<00:03:20.430> or<00:03:21.330> the<00:03:21.420> craters<00:03:21.690> always<00:03:21.900> did<00:03:22.019> a<00:03:22.110> good

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
always or the craters always did a good

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:27.530 
always or the craters always did a good
job<00:03:22.410> of<00:03:25.190> balancing<00:03:26.190> that<00:03:26.820> up<00:03:27.150> to<00:03:27.269> this<00:03:27.360> point

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
job of balancing that up to this point

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.530 
job of balancing that up to this point
but<00:03:27.690> I<00:03:27.780> think<00:03:28.140> the<00:03:28.590> movie<00:03:28.970> aired<00:03:29.970> a<00:03:30.239> little<00:03:30.420> bit

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
but I think the movie aired a little bit

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.479 
but I think the movie aired a little bit
too<00:03:30.720> much<00:03:30.930> on<00:03:31.290> the<00:03:31.560> side<00:03:31.739> okie<00:03:32.100> on<00:03:32.190> explaining

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
too much on the side okie on explaining

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:33.199 
too much on the side okie on explaining
things<00:03:32.670> to<00:03:32.760> you<00:03:32.850> there<00:03:32.970> were<00:03:33.030> several

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
things to you there were several

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.449 
things to you there were several
sequences<00:03:33.570> where<00:03:34.320> stuffs<00:03:35.010> happening<00:03:35.340> on

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
sequences where stuffs happening on

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.360 
sequences where stuffs happening on
