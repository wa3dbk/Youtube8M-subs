 class ccoo puts the ones of him because also of a device also 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:32.150
 clear that this system is called pedalboard this index nahb effects 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:36.240
 nn which we can play with them and have a lot more creativity 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.310
 more possibilities when it comes to playing 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.310
 the talent that has opinion that has 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:44.680
 and look 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.629
 here if we want to achieve an effect 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:49.629
 electric 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.610
 if we want something acoustic 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.610
 more classic 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.720
 my opera that we have here is called cubagua east 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.200
 is something 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.880
 quite interesting is nothing new of what to do 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.210
 it has not been for a long time 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.210
 it was developing 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.770
 I'm interested in death 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.150
 the electric bicycle and how with a baggage yes of course has enough 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.350
 Very fun possibilities to learn to play the guitar but also requires 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.350
 pretty practice room invitation 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.020
 missing for this reason 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.119
 I read exchange to the hectic oo koldo of I can say of him if you dedicate 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.630
 let's say that when I decide you war 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.380
 guitarists that I liked 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.380
 this fact asked him exactly from this same question 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:58.729
 ii 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.270
 for example they answered me 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.280
 ebony 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.630
 the more practice is better musician airs let's say that I practiced 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.970
 round and so far 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.479
 the full template 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.900
 would make me as thalia headquarters of the school I will finish obligations and 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:14.909
 the first practice 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:17.479
 at that time when a policy 

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:18.959
 electric 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.109
 the step by the concepts of payment of the quota 

00:02:22.109 --> 00:02:26.459
 He said it was very necessary because they want to make your music 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.769
 quality you have to learn a lot the techniques the classical guitar 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.759
 I think the zoo is 

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:37.879
 a responsibility of those who study removing it electric has to 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:41.759
 respect that and they have to learn to play acoustic guitar much needed 

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:45.969
 most of the best guitarists in the world use that system that 

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:48.639
 method of learning to play soon 

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:51.899
 quintal half its giant glances 

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:56.469
 there is a lot of quite rytas have that currently with talent 

00:02:56.469 --> 00:02:58.199
 for every day more empty 

00:02:58.199 --> 00:03:02.159
 n let's quote him to support the people here venezuela who is doing 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:05.109
 a great job for a hundred or do not need to hit 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:08.169
 worldwide this pando mendoza 

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:10.509
 for me he is a guitarist 

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:14.239
 in cuba the best electric guitar guitarists who have venezuela 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.369
 have pity that women do not know him 

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:19.989
 i although globally if I have 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:24.079
 and we have quite the good times 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:27.590
 and I think they emanate more Latin rhythm those 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:28.469
 the tip 

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:31.449
 santana also an excellent guitarist 

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:32.719
 d 

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:34.319
 embodies electric 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.380
 reiss between the guitar 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.489
 acoustic and she 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.759
 the team 

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:44.589
 the company between the acoustic guitar and the good electric known and being 

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:48.409
 there are techniques of the electric guitar like the celtic and a sweep 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:49.339
 Spanish 

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:50.209
 tactical 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.259
 what it means to love pillar 

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:55.099
 this fact things that do not apply 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:57.009
 Guitar 

00:03:57.009 --> 00:04:00.009
 eat out and cacique real show part 

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:03.169
 everything is wrong 

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:06.169
 in order to silence motorcycles 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.969
 and thus equipment in the matter of economic policy in sweeping 

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:37.969
 It's a kind of river 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.879
 if you take 

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:09.999
 It is similar to culture 

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:15.369
 basically the same technique that is practiced percent because if what is 

00:05:15.369 --> 00:05:18.189
 seeks is to have strength and agility in babies 

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:19.590
 as the authorities 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.520
 and what its merger the leader 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.150
 baron basically of his function this he did before trying to achieve it vitti 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.449
 different types of sounds 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:31.099
 Some more 

00:05:31.099 --> 00:05:33.219
 brilliance others more opaque 

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:36.999
 for example this is the tremor potentiometers published 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.969
 in the shoemaker's bridge is activating the sacyr castle 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:43.120
 The only one 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.550
 and therefore more cutting sounds 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.550
 It is much brighter 

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:55.039
 I smelled a message content 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:59.990
 to all the tickets since 2002 your club the tele you have to learn from the guitar 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:02.529
 electric that is an instrument 

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:04.900
 very sound airbus 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:09.280
 one hundred meetings have slipped third popular appointment responsible for these 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.529
 guys who practice 

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:14.409
 It is a docile instrument 

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:17.159
 have an interest in music 

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:19.779
 of heart that they do it because they really want 

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:23.490
 do something with this really yes you can can be reached on one side with 

00:06:23.489 --> 00:06:24.499
 with the music 

00:06:24.499 --> 00:06:28.199
 that they study rather useless that they do not do it in a way that not by fashion 

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:31.539
 for these not for us but really little seriousness 

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:34.589
 in the end associated September point 

00:06:35.089 --> 00:06:37.849
 boy first thing is 

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:38.860
 force 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:40.050
 work 

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:41.529
 and more work 

00:06:41.529 --> 00:06:43.930

 nothing made the dotcom foresee 

00:06:57.789 --> 00:07:00.699
 Gladly but we are waiting here 

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:03.100
