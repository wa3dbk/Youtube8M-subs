00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.369
 that is why graduation graduation took place at the design academy in eindhoven 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:15.739
 I found that strollers at that time very pleasant and actually very much 

00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:17.769
 to 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:20.489
 I would say designed for women actually designed for nobody 

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:21.849
 fall 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:24.739
 There are no fine products and I also had the feeling 

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:28.569
 That will make a stroller much more than fashion statement could be much more a 

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:31.369
 could be gadget and then I actually want to make responsible for it 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.690
 men they could walk well behind longer legroom 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.630
 and especially more functionality, the challenge to openly use from 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.630
 products are discovery 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.210
 so the first thing i want to show is that 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.570
 to pick up your pure nonsense in this case is not 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.630
 which is therefore also will 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:54.260
 as a place where much easier to place reversible the to set up in 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.080
 on the expected names and because the seat is finished 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.660
 It is also a possibility that women naturally suggest you grab the seat 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.640
 that moment it sits it was about to settle 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.760
 but believe me 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.110
 the central wrote new lock locked 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.560
 they play 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.560
 so the emerging when positions are activated 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.760
 the fund is secured more securely on the chassis, so actually in one 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:20.460
 movement 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.180
 3 things take place where you as a user do not have to take into account 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.770
 to hold 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.770
 it all goes very easily by itself 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.030
 what you see here with this knowledge is that there are big wheels in front of the small ones 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.950
 rear wheels 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.109
 We call this forest the field 

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:37.200
 with this you can 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.840
 Doctors sound themselves a bit more in their own field 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.690
 easy obstacles can live for the animals under large wheels 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.280
 but if you want to change product to 2 0 position because you now want the storage 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.840
 to go 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.350
 whether on the beach with loose sand or gravel danneels is this actually stood 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.640
 no longer being more suitable are not wanting to become too small anyway 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.409
 And then you try to rack up those that were 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.990
 from the g20 audio sand and then you can move there more easily and for that 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.340
 you must have product 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.670
 a 2 0 position 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.239
 the last 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.279
 what do you do as follows 

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:16.279
 takes the seat 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.969
 instead that 

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:20.329
 now you have a product 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:24.069
 if you can pull after you you can easily take obstacles 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.749
 with you we pull the car over tenants with a constant two 

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:33.829
 game class Volkskrant the throat class a forest class but the farmer also has one 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:34.660
 city â€‹â€‹beach 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.680
 in the city city actually where you are most used for it 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.209
 consumer confidence 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.180
 with these small naps prosperity the word agile that signal the city 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.210
 evade oldebroek Friday but you can 

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:51.749
 Rotate 180 degrees 

00:02:51.749 --> 00:02:53.529
 and 

00:02:53.529 --> 00:02:54.819
 so practical 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.899
 time it the pram against a curb and you have ten days 

00:02:58.899 --> 00:03:01.029
 a suitcase full over it 4 

00:03:01.029 --> 00:03:04.320
 and what do most times to the hospital never before was it 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.149
 and for that we have developed feeling clarke suspension 

00:03:08.149 --> 00:03:12.129
 so the frog veering and actually and what does he do not do for nier 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:13.610
 vertical movement 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:14.720
 but you make it 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.559
 Schiphol movement backwards 

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:18.669
 but by we really want to 

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:21.669
 jump out according to parking 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:27.829
 the central spain in combination with the white beats made functionality no 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:29.109
 appeal possible 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:31.380
 it is actually a very simple construction 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.760
 who actually cannot insure because of that certainty 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:38.840
 it seems like the product is one 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.760
 giving a chronic image it is still simple 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.170
 that was almost catchable type and can become 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:46.680
 taken for understanding
