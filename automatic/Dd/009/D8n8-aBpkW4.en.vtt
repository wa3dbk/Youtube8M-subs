00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:02.660 
babies ended up in my yard there was a
turtle<00:07:01.380> anyways<00:07:01.770> he<00:07:01.950> landed<00:07:02.280> over<00:07:02.430> here

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:02.670 
turtle anyways he landed over here

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:07.480 
turtle anyways he landed over here
somewhere<00:07:02.910> there's<00:07:03.270> a<00:07:03.360> hole<00:07:03.540> right<00:07:03.570> here

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:07.490 

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:12.410 

that's<00:07:08.490> where<00:07:08.670> he<00:07:08.820> got<00:07:09.030> the<00:07:09.180> snake<00:07:11.330> it's<00:07:12.330> a

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:12.420 
that's where he got the snake it's a

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:15.740 
that's where he got the snake it's a
prairie<00:07:12.720> dog<00:07:12.930> holes<00:07:13.230> a<00:07:14.060> bunch<00:07:15.060> of<00:07:15.180> around<00:07:15.510> here

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:15.750 
prairie dog holes a bunch of around here

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:18.650 
prairie dog holes a bunch of around here
I<00:07:16.550> guess<00:07:17.550> that's<00:07:17.760> why<00:07:17.880> they<00:07:18.000> keep<00:07:18.180> coming<00:07:18.240> back

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:18.660 
I guess that's why they keep coming back

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:21.410 
I guess that's why they keep coming back
to<00:07:18.870> this<00:07:18.990> area<00:07:19.670> because<00:07:20.670> there's<00:07:21.150> so<00:07:21.300> many
