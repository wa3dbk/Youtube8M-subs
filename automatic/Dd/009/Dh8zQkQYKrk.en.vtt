colors<00:01:38.830> show<00:01:39.130> up<00:01:39.430> on<00:01:39.640> the<00:01:39.760> fabric<00:01:39.940> and<00:01:40.240> they

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
colors show up on the fabric and they

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:42.540 
colors show up on the fabric and they
are<00:01:40.900> permanent<00:01:41.590> though<00:01:41.710> by<00:01:41.980> the<00:01:42.040> way<00:01:42.190> on<00:01:42.430> the

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.910 
are permanent though by the way on the
fabric<00:01:42.850> so<00:01:43.240> once<00:01:43.960> it<00:01:44.140> is<00:01:44.230> colored<00:01:44.560> you<00:01:44.680> can't

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
fabric so once it is colored you can't

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.110 
fabric so once it is colored you can't
wash<00:01:45.040> them<00:01:45.220> off<00:01:45.340> which<00:01:45.550> is<00:01:45.700> actually<00:01:46.000> pretty
