00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.360
 well I'm here at the beginning of 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.360
 fernandez ladreda 

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:10.280
 this is avenida de fernÃ¡ndez ladreda 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:12.860
 to teach the different forms of 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:16.789
 at the traffic lights as they have to pass 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.740
 the pedestrians this is always like this if 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.060
 comes a pedestrian with cars have 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.220
 to stop but he is always 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.890
 intermittent on the other hand the one that was 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.230
 recording was this we have this other that 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.669
 it is also always intermittent and if 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.570
 understands that lohan is intermittent 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:35.899
 then the cars must stop so that 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.980
 spend the people continue with the same 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:40.550
 avenue 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.499
 a true one there is where we were in 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.589
 this case when the traffic light is 

00:00:42.499 --> 00:00:48.019
 intermittent pedestrians can not 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:48.859
 spend they have to wait for it to get 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:50.749
 Red 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:51.920
 then if you come with the car in one 

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:53.600
 when it is flashing it has 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.890
 preference to the pedestrian but in the 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.379
 next when it is flashing 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:01.449
 you have preference with the car and the 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.449
 pedestrian is the one who should wait 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.049
 when it's red 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.619
 with this in reds when the cars for 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:11.250
 your past 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.800
 intermittent 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.650
 has preference to cars and we're going to 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:20.400
 see the next one following the 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:24.600
 roundabout has no light for cars no 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.790
 It has no light and if it gets when 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.850
 It flashes is when the cars 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:33.710
 they must stop at this intermittent 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.710
 means for when there is nothing 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.900
 always because everything happens 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.600
 here intermittent means brake for 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:49.100
 pass pedestrians in the previous 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.900
 intermittent was just passing up 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:55.030
 wait for it to be in red let's 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:59.380
 go to the last one from there really coming 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.490
 at last we have that in red it is for and 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.310
 in yellow 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.100
 you can spend here good now there's no 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.020
 nobody to heal here goes the other way around 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.390
 amber when it is flashing is when 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.330
 you can pass and when it turns red it's 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.880
 when you can, there's always someone 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.940
 cross when you can pass as you see this 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.220
 It is a Christ that there is no good who 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.520
 understand what is coming down this avenue and 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:27.000
 in amber which means stop or move to 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.000
 ask the question
