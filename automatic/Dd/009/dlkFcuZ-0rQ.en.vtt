what<00:00:13.950> is<00:00:14.280> an<00:00:14.759> inversion<00:00:15.440> well<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.560> easy<00:00:16.800> way

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
what is an inversion well the easy way

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.000 
what is an inversion well the easy way
to<00:00:17.850> tell<00:00:18.090> you<00:00:18.119> about<00:00:18.480> inversions<00:00:19.320> is<00:00:19.439> just<00:00:19.859> to

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
to tell you about inversions is just to

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.279 
to tell you about inversions is just to
show<00:00:20.250> you<00:00:20.279> so<00:00:20.910> let's<00:00:21.090> form<00:00:21.390> our<00:00:21.539> C<00:00:21.779> chord<00:00:22.020> and

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
show you so let's form our C chord and

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.890 
show you so let's form our C chord and
move<00:00:22.830> them<00:00:23.039> on<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.310> C<00:00:23.519> count<00:00:23.939> up<00:00:24.210> whole<00:00:24.510> step

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
move them on the C count up whole step

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.500 
move them on the C count up whole step
whole<00:00:25.080> step<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.560> step<00:00:25.619> whole<00:00:26.099> step<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.699> then

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
whole step a step whole step and then

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.749 
whole step a step whole step and then
135<00:00:29.000> there's<00:00:30.000> your<00:00:30.330> C<00:00:30.570> major<00:00:30.779> chord<00:00:31.640> well<00:00:32.640> an

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
135 there's your C major chord well an

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.770 
135 there's your C major chord well an
inversion<00:00:33.180> is<00:00:33.540> this<00:00:33.870> C<00:00:34.649> this<00:00:34.829> C<00:00:34.890> here<00:00:35.690> did<00:00:36.690> you

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
inversion is this C this C here did you

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.900 
inversion is this C this C here did you
know<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:37.290> can<00:00:37.530> stick<00:00:37.860> that<00:00:38.040> see<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.670> top

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
know that I can stick that see the top

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.729 
know that I can stick that see the top
and<00:00:40.370> this<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.520> also<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.969> safe<00:00:42.270> board<00:00:42.590> what<00:00:43.590> I've

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
and this is also a safe board what I've

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.420 
and this is also a safe board what I've
done<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.370> inverted<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.450> up<00:00:45.690> so<00:00:46.620> this<00:00:46.800> is<00:00:47.039> a

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
done is inverted it up so this is a

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.020 
done is inverted it up so this is a
first<00:00:47.789> inversion<00:00:48.450> C<00:00:48.840> chord<00:00:49.700> here<00:00:50.700> was<00:00:50.820> my

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
first inversion C chord here was my

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.490 
first inversion C chord here was my
current<00:00:51.329> position<00:00:51.510> C<00:00:52.050> chord

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
current position C chord

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.930 
current position C chord
I<00:00:52.649> threw<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.520> C<00:00:53.730> on<00:00:53.879> top<00:00:55.340> is<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.399> first

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
I threw the C on top is a first

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.979 
I threw the C on top is a first
inversion<00:00:57.510> C<00:00:57.960> chord<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:59.270> can<00:01:00.270> even<00:01:00.420> do<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:00.629> again

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
inversion C chord I can even do it again

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.579 
inversion C chord I can even do it again
this<00:01:01.710> beat<00:01:01.980> right<00:01:02.219> here<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:03.080> can<00:01:04.080> throw<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.470> a

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
this beat right here I can throw the a

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.859 
this beat right here I can throw the a
on<00:01:04.769> top<00:01:05.630> and<00:01:06.630> that<00:01:06.689> is<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.770> second<00:01:08.460> inversion<00:01:09.180> C

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
on top and that is a second inversion C

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.920 
on top and that is a second inversion C
chord<00:01:10.580> now<00:01:11.580> what<00:01:11.790> happens<00:01:12.210> if<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.600> throw<00:01:12.900> this

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
chord now what happens if I throw this

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.899 
chord now what happens if I throw this
jam<00:01:13.350> right<00:01:13.619> here<00:01:13.729> on<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.939> top<00:01:15.740> well<00:01:16.740> I'm<00:01:17.460> back

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
jam right here on the top well I'm back

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.289 
jam right here on the top well I'm back
to<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.299> C<00:01:18.750> in<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.200> root<00:01:19.350> position<00:01:19.380> again<00:01:20.270> so<00:01:21.270> a

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
to a C in the root position again so a

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.630 
to a C in the root position again so a
good<00:01:21.600> exercise<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.650> practice<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.460> learn

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
good exercise to practice to learn

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.420 
good exercise to practice to learn
inversions<00:01:24.439> is<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.770> start<00:01:26.070> in<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.250> root

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
inversions is to start in the root

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.060 
inversions is to start in the root
position<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:27.150> any<00:01:27.420> chord<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.110> just<00:01:28.860> keep

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
position of any chord and just keep

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.340 
position of any chord and just keep
inverting<00:01:29.640> it<00:01:29.759> up<00:01:29.909> there's<00:01:30.659> actually<00:01:31.170> only

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
inverting it up there's actually only

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.460 
inverting it up there's actually only
three<00:01:31.530> positions<00:01:32.340> in<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.670> major<00:01:32.880> chord<00:01:33.470> that

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
three positions in a major chord that

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.249 
three positions in a major chord that
have<00:01:35.130> inversions<00:01:35.700> so<00:01:36.329> here's<00:01:36.600> C<00:01:36.869> in<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.110> root

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
have inversions so here's C in the root

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.520 
have inversions so here's C in the root
position

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.380 

here's<00:01:40.520> the<00:01:40.700> first<00:01:40.940> inversion

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
here's the first inversion

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.020 
here's the first inversion
here's<00:01:43.020> second<00:01:43.530> immersion

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
here's second immersion

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.770 
here's second immersion
and<00:01:45.390> then<00:01:46.110> here's<00:01:46.410> back<00:01:46.710> at<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.040> root<00:01:47.780> these

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
and then here's back at the root these

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.940 
and then here's back at the root these
are<00:01:48.960> exactly<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.470> same<00:01:53.180> first<00:01:54.180> inversion

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
are exactly the same first inversion

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.250 
are exactly the same first inversion
second<00:01:55.950> inversion<00:01:56.720> headed<00:01:57.720> back<00:01:57.960> at<00:01:58.140> the

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
second inversion headed back at the

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.820 
second inversion headed back at the
roots<00:01:59.690> let's<00:02:00.690> try<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.020> with<00:02:01.229> another<00:02:01.530> chord

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
roots let's try it with another chord

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.630 
roots let's try it with another chord
let's<00:02:02.640> try<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:02.940> with<00:02:03.270> an<00:02:03.510> F<00:02:03.750> chord<00:02:04.160> here's<00:02:05.160> an<00:02:05.460> F

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
let's try it with an F chord here's an F

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.850 
let's try it with an F chord here's an F
chord<00:02:05.970> we're<00:02:06.840> going<00:02:06.960> to<00:02:07.050> count<00:02:07.260> to<00:02:07.470> figure<00:02:07.740> it

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
chord we're going to count to figure it

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.529 
chord we're going to count to figure it
out<00:02:07.979> we'll<00:02:08.160> count<00:02:08.399> up<00:02:08.580> little<00:02:09.119> step<00:02:09.330> ball<00:02:09.479> step

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
out we'll count up little step ball step

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.920 
out we'll count up little step ball step
half<00:02:10.170> step<00:02:10.200> whole<00:02:10.709> step<00:02:11.090> one<00:02:12.090> through<00:02:12.270> five

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
half step whole step one through five

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.270 
half step whole step one through five
there<00:02:13.770> is<00:02:14.130> your<00:02:14.400> F<00:02:14.640> chord<00:02:15.560> now<00:02:16.560> let's<00:02:16.800> inverted

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
there is your F chord now let's inverted

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.430 
there is your F chord now let's inverted
up<00:02:17.459> one<00:02:17.700> let's<00:02:18.090> throw<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.420> seven<00:02:18.930> here<00:02:19.110> on<00:02:19.290> the

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
up one let's throw the seven here on the

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:26.930 
up one let's throw the seven here on the
top<00:02:21.080> is<00:02:22.080> a<00:02:22.530> first<00:02:23.090> inversion<00:02:24.090> F<00:02:24.690> chord<00:02:25.940> let's

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
top is a first inversion F chord let's

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.880 
top is a first inversion F chord let's
take<00:02:27.209> this<00:02:27.390> edge<00:02:27.660> right<00:02:27.959> here<00:02:28.020> and<00:02:28.260> throw<00:02:28.650> that

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
take this edge right here and throw that

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.110 
take this edge right here and throw that
on<00:02:29.070> the<00:02:29.220> top<00:02:30.920> and<00:02:31.920> there<00:02:32.370> is<00:02:32.610> a<00:02:32.640> second

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
on the top and there is a second

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.020 
on the top and there is a second
inversion<00:02:33.450> F<00:02:33.810> chord<00:02:34.170> and<00:02:35.070> what<00:02:35.400> happens<00:02:35.760> if<00:02:35.910> we

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
inversion F chord and what happens if we

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.449 
inversion F chord and what happens if we
throw<00:02:36.270> this<00:02:36.770> back<00:02:37.770> at<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.040> top

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:40.459 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:43.390 

we're<00:02:41.060> back<00:02:41.239> at<00:02:41.420> the<00:02:41.540> roots<00:02:41.890> so<00:02:42.890> if<00:02:43.040> you<00:02:43.159> wanted

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
we're back at the roots so if you wanted

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.190 
we're back at the roots so if you wanted
to<00:02:43.519> practice<00:02:43.760> inversions<00:02:44.689> with<00:02:44.870> an<00:02:44.989> F<00:02:45.170> chord

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
to practice inversions with an F chord

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:52.510 
to practice inversions with an F chord
you<00:02:46.159> could<00:02:46.340> go<00:02:46.519> like<00:02:46.700> this

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.860 

so<00:02:53.300> again<00:02:53.630> that's<00:02:54.010> bridge<00:02:55.010> position<00:02:55.870> first

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
so again that's bridge position first

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.260 
so again that's bridge position first
inversion<00:02:58.000> second<00:02:59.000> inversion<00:02:59.860> and<00:03:00.860> then<00:03:01.270> back

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:02.270 
inversion second inversion and then back

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:05.610 
inversion second inversion and then back
to<00:03:02.300> the<00:03:02.600> root<00:03:03.520> so<00:03:04.520> let's<00:03:04.760> use<00:03:05.000> the<00:03:05.210> song

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
to the root so let's use the song

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.010 
to the root so let's use the song
Alleluia<00:03:06.620> and<00:03:06.800> play<00:03:07.670> some<00:03:08.030> inverted<00:03:08.630> chords

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.020 
Alleluia and play some inverted chords

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.920 
Alleluia and play some inverted chords
this<00:03:09.200> time<00:03:09.640> the<00:03:10.640> first<00:03:10.880> chord<00:03:11.210> in<00:03:11.360> Alleluia

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
this time the first chord in Alleluia

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.890 
this time the first chord in Alleluia
was<00:03:12.110> an<00:03:12.260> F<00:03:12.410> chord<00:03:15.820> let's<00:03:16.820> try<00:03:17.090> inverting<00:03:17.480> it<00:03:17.720> up

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
was an F chord let's try inverting it up

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.750 
was an F chord let's try inverting it up
one<00:03:18.140> let's<00:03:18.410> take<00:03:18.620> this<00:03:18.800> F<00:03:19.070> here<00:03:19.340> and<00:03:19.520> throw<00:03:19.700> it

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
one let's take this F here and throw it

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.930 
one let's take this F here and throw it
on<00:03:19.850> the<00:03:19.970> top

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.050 

the<00:03:25.940> next<00:03:26.330> chord<00:03:26.720> was<00:03:26.990> a<00:03:27.020> B<00:03:27.319> flat<00:03:27.590> chord<00:03:28.060> which

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
the next chord was a B flat chord which

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.340 
the next chord was a B flat chord which
is<00:03:29.090> right<00:03:29.450> here<00:03:29.480> and<00:03:29.780> I<00:03:29.870> think<00:03:29.900> we'll<00:03:30.170> just

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
is right here and I think we'll just

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.850 
is right here and I think we'll just
keep<00:03:30.440> that<00:03:30.800> one<00:03:30.980> right<00:03:31.190> there<00:03:31.459> and<00:03:32.650> then<00:03:33.650> the

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
keep that one right there and then the

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.770 
keep that one right there and then the
third<00:03:33.890> chord<00:03:34.400> was<00:03:34.580> a<00:03:34.610> C<00:03:34.880> chord<00:03:35.150> and<00:03:35.480> we're

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
third chord was a C chord and we're

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.050 
third chord was a C chord and we're
going<00:03:36.050> to<00:03:36.080> invert<00:03:36.560> that<00:03:36.620> down<00:03:37.220> here<00:03:37.640> is<00:03:37.790> that

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
going to invert that down here is that

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.750 
going to invert that down here is that
seam<00:03:38.510> or<00:03:38.720> that<00:03:38.930> we<00:03:39.080> used<00:03:39.350> in<00:03:39.830> the<00:03:40.280> last<00:03:40.310> video

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
seam or that we used in the last video

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.720 
seam or that we used in the last video
but<00:03:41.570> what<00:03:41.780> if<00:03:41.870> we<00:03:41.959> take<00:03:42.140> this<00:03:42.200> tip<00:03:42.560> here<00:03:42.980> let<00:03:43.610> me

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
but what if we take this tip here let me

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.630 
but what if we take this tip here let me
throw<00:03:43.940> that<00:03:44.000> the<00:03:44.240> bottom<00:03:44.890> that's<00:03:45.890> also<00:03:46.340> a<00:03:46.370> C

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
throw that the bottom that's also a C

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.300 
throw that the bottom that's also a C
chord<00:03:46.910> and<00:03:47.090> we<00:03:47.390> will<00:03:47.570> use<00:03:47.720> that<00:03:47.959> C<00:03:48.290> chord<00:03:48.500> in

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
chord and we will use that C chord in

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.330 
chord and we will use that C chord in
the<00:03:49.459> song<00:03:49.700> hallelujah<00:03:50.120> this<00:03:50.720> time<00:03:51.310> so<00:03:52.310> you

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
the song hallelujah this time so you

00:03:52.340 --> 00:04:27.480 
the song hallelujah this time so you
could<00:03:52.700> play<00:03:52.910> the<00:03:52.970> song<00:03:53.300> this<00:03:53.510> way

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.820 

now<00:04:28.490> let's<00:04:29.090> add<00:04:29.330> back<00:04:29.630> in<00:04:29.660> the<00:04:30.110> movement<00:04:30.590> that

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
now let's add back in the movement that

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.640 
now let's add back in the movement that
we<00:04:31.550> did<00:04:31.700> in<00:04:31.790> the<00:04:31.910> first<00:04:32.090> video<00:04:32.360> and<00:04:33.020> what<00:04:33.560> we're

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
we did in the first video and what we're

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.120 
we did in the first video and what we're
gonna<00:04:33.710> do<00:04:34.010> is<00:04:34.130> the<00:04:34.280> top<00:04:34.490> two<00:04:34.730> notes<00:04:35.860> rock<00:04:36.860> back

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
gonna do is the top two notes rock back

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.830 
gonna do is the top two notes rock back
and<00:04:37.160> forth<00:04:37.460> between<00:04:37.730> the<00:04:38.030> top<00:04:38.240> two<00:04:38.270> notes<00:04:38.660> and

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
and forth between the top two notes and

00:04:38.840 --> 00:05:14.080 
and forth between the top two notes and
the<00:04:38.930> bottom

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.510 

one<00:05:15.090> more<00:05:15.300> thing<00:05:15.330> to<00:05:15.570> note<00:05:16.340> when<00:05:17.340> we're

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
one more thing to note when we're

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.570 
one more thing to note when we're
playing<00:05:17.790> chords<00:05:18.420> with<00:05:19.410> other<00:05:19.710> chords<00:05:20.220> we<00:05:20.370> want

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
playing chords with other chords we want

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.270 
playing chords with other chords we want
to<00:05:20.670> keep<00:05:20.850> them<00:05:21.060> in<00:05:21.330> about<00:05:21.600> the<00:05:21.810> same<00:05:22.280> vicinity

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
to keep them in about the same vicinity

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.280 
to keep them in about the same vicinity
of<00:05:23.970> the<00:05:24.120> keys<00:05:24.360> as<00:05:24.630> possible

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:25.290 
of the keys as possible

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.260 
of the keys as possible
technically<00:05:26.100> you<00:05:26.250> don't<00:05:26.460> want<00:05:26.640> to<00:05:26.700> be<00:05:26.790> jumping

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:27.270 
technically you don't want to be jumping

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.279 
technically you don't want to be jumping
all<00:05:27.450> around<00:05:27.860> the<00:05:28.860> Cure

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:30.289 
all around the Cure

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:34.279 
all around the Cure
doesn't<00:05:31.289> sound<00:05:31.470> it's<00:05:31.800> fluid<00:05:32.270> but<00:05:33.270> that's<00:05:34.080> why

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:34.289 
doesn't sound it's fluid but that's why

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:35.320 
doesn't sound it's fluid but that's why
we<00:05:34.500> use<00:05:34.650> inversion

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
we use inversion

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:39.770 
we use inversion
the<00:05:36.330> cords<00:05:36.840> as<00:05:37.410> close<00:05:37.770> together<00:05:38.069> as<00:05:38.539> we<00:05:39.539> can

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
the cords as close together as we can

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.920 
the cords as close together as we can
there's<00:05:40.410> not<00:05:40.590> as<00:05:40.740> much<00:05:40.889> movement<00:05:41.780> so<00:05:42.780> it

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
there's not as much movement so it

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.580 
there's not as much movement so it
sounds<00:05:43.259> more<00:05:43.380> fluid<00:05:45.229> now<00:05:46.229> we're<00:05:46.410> going<00:05:46.530> to

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
sounds more fluid now we're going to

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.589 
sounds more fluid now we're going to
learn<00:05:46.740> about<00:05:46.830> common<00:05:47.490> tones<00:05:47.729> common<00:05:48.330> tones

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:48.599 
learn about common tones common tones

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:51.070 
learn about common tones common tones
are<00:05:48.960> notes<00:05:49.259> that<00:05:49.500> are<00:05:49.590> shared<00:05:49.889> between<00:05:50.099> cords

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
are notes that are shared between cords

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.740 
are notes that are shared between cords
here's<00:05:52.080> the<00:05:52.229> F<00:05:52.380> chord<00:05:52.680> used<00:05:53.150> this<00:05:54.150> map<00:05:54.509> is

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
here's the F chord used this map is

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:57.439 
here's the F chord used this map is
going<00:05:54.960> to<00:05:55.020> be<00:05:55.139> a<00:05:55.169> common<00:05:55.620> tone<00:05:55.880> between<00:05:56.880> the<00:05:57.330> F

00:05:57.439 --> 00:05:57.449 
going to be a common tone between the F

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:00.320 
going to be a common tone between the F
chord<00:05:57.720> and<00:05:58.020> the<00:05:58.080> B<00:05:58.229> flat<00:05:58.440> chord<00:05:58.970> because<00:05:59.970> it's

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
chord and the B flat chord because it's

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:06.560 
chord and the B flat chord because it's
shared<00:06:00.680> so<00:06:01.680> it's<00:06:01.830> called<00:06:02.069> a<00:06:02.160> common<00:06:02.550> tone<00:06:05.570> what

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:06.570 
shared so it's called a common tone what

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:09.920 
shared so it's called a common tone what
if<00:06:06.690> we<00:06:06.870> were<00:06:07.020> playing<00:06:07.380> a<00:06:07.710> soup<00:06:08.190> or<00:06:08.400> here<00:06:08.880> and<00:06:09.150> we

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930 
if we were playing a soup or here and we

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:14.300 
if we were playing a soup or here and we
ended<00:06:10.259> up<00:06:10.380> on<00:06:10.560> this<00:06:10.770> end<00:06:11.009> or<00:06:11.310> here<00:06:12.680> the<00:06:13.680> C<00:06:14.009> would

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:14.310 
ended up on this end or here the C would

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:22.610 
ended up on this end or here the C would
become<00:06:14.639> the<00:06:14.789> common<00:06:15.150> tone<00:06:20.930> C<00:06:21.930> is<00:06:22.080> the<00:06:22.229> common

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.890 
become the common tone C is the common
tone<00:06:22.860> or<00:06:23.639> the<00:06:23.669> note<00:06:24.060> shared<00:06:24.720> between<00:06:25.590> chords

so<00:06:27.900> again<00:06:28.199> the<00:06:28.380> goal<00:06:28.560> is<00:06:28.830> to<00:06:28.860> have<00:06:29.190> the<00:06:29.370> courts

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:29.789 
so again the goal is to have the courts

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:31.520 
so again the goal is to have the courts
be<00:06:30.060> placed<00:06:30.419> together<00:06:30.630> as<00:06:30.990> close<00:06:31.169> as<00:06:31.470> possible

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:31.530 
be placed together as close as possible

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:35.599 
be placed together as close as possible
and<00:06:32.460> then<00:06:32.580> it<00:06:32.699> sounds<00:06:33.000> more<00:06:33.180> fluid
