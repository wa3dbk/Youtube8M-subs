confident<00:01:46.950> in<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.060> vehicles<00:01:48.479> for<00:01:48.659> sure<00:01:48.869> my

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
confident in the vehicles for sure my

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.710 
confident in the vehicles for sure my
technician<00:01:49.890> likes<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.850> vehicles<00:01:51.270> because

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
technician likes the vehicles because

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.800 
technician likes the vehicles because
there's<00:01:52.110> longer<00:01:52.729> intervals<00:01:53.729> in<00:01:53.970> service<00:01:54.630> with

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
there's longer intervals in service with

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.920 
there's longer intervals in service with
all<00:01:54.840> changes<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:56.190> sort<00:01:56.430> of<00:01:56.460> thing<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:56.930> if

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
all changes and that sort of thing so if

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:58.910 
all changes and that sort of thing so if
he's<00:01:58.080> not<00:01:58.110> having<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.530> do<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:58.740> as<00:01:58.830> frequently

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
he's not having to do it as frequently

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.340 
he's not having to do it as frequently
that's<00:01:59.399> saving<00:01:59.729> him<00:01:59.909> time<00:02:00.119> it's<00:02:00.570> saving<00:02:00.869> us<00:02:01.080> on

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
that's saving him time it's saving us on

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.609 
that's saving him time it's saving us on
service<00:02:01.799> items<00:02:02.190> oil<00:02:03.350> those<00:02:04.350> type<00:02:04.590> of
