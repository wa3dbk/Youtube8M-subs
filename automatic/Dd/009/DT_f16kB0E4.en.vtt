00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:09.230
 he is probably the fastest racing car for 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.519
 the street of this porsche 918 spyder with 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.500
 hybrid drive he can do all that 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.910
 race cars can also and where can he do that 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.540
 best of course on one 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.340
 Racetrack 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.080
 there we are in Spain on the 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.279
 racecourse of valencia and there will 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.279
 I give it a go now 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:34.470
 this sports car offers the superlative 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.390
 limited to future technology 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.430
 on 918 copies 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.200
 the passionate design beats 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.300
 a bridge between the race track and 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.590
 street flat and wide crouching of 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.590
 spyder on the asphalt 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.170
 The hybrid offers three engines of 4 147 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.390
 kw strong combustion engine sits behind 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.469
 on the axis lie the two motors 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.899
 front and back 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.810
 the two-seater of a monocoque 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.880
 made of carbon fiber reinforced plastic 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:12.990
 builds on the genes of the carrera 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.680
 the 917 Porsche racing car and the rs 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.049
 spyder 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.549
 the interior is a feast for the eyes to 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.990
 caresses a towering 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.390
 Center console looks in three 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.270
 freestanding and instruments and attacks 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.729
 in a small multifunction steering wheel the 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.300
 narrow carbon shells make you feel 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.300
 come up 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.630
 a large touchscreen can operate like 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:42.460
 A smartphone makes many switches 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:46.320
 superfluous a turn on this switch 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.320
 makes the engine roar 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.380
 In addition, further driving modes can be 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.659
 choose 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.759
 in the electric mode, however, the silent 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.690
 v8 but now we want the spyder on 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:03.690
 experience the race track 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:21.659
 even if legend walter röhrl has the 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:24.120
 Tested 918 spyder 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:27.870
 when you're on the track here 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:31.500
 I have never driven a car that 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:35.349
 street admission has me in principle 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.569
 absolutely like a racing car that ends 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:40.650
 car drives here on the race track as 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.650
 it would be built for it 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:58.070
 first street legal vehicle 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:02.170
 the 918 spyder smashed the round 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.170
 the nürburgring in under seven minutes 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.650
 I also have these electric motors 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:13.800
 can not believe in the beginning 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.280
 Of course they give the salt in the 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.460
 Soup 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.440
 it is 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.560
 in order to 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.050
 do you have scary power as soon as you do that 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.840
 Gaspedal touched that I have in one 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:27.000
 normal internal combustion engine not yet 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:31.010
 experienced and this interacting that is 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.010
 the unique affair 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.940
 also claus with joke it's something 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.940
 very special 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.189
 his driving is extreme and that 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:53.200
 becomes clear when you go to the gas 

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:55.090
 is there you will formally in the seat 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.250
 pressed when braking it is exactly 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.840
 the other way, the fires brutal too 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.239
 of course, the interesting ones are 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.930
 acceleration values in 0 77 seconds 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:08.790
 the thing has arrived at 200 and all 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.790
 brutal is the sound heard you 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.620
 and 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:31.060
 His values are also brutal in only 26 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:34.300
 seconds he is up to 100 and in 20.9 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:37.030
 300 km / h the consumption is porsche 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.280
 31 liters on 100 kilometers at can 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:42.460
 one starts from the tenfold if one the 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:45.460
 top speed of 345 km / h 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:48.640
 the two engines are aiming for 210 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:53.100
 kw and together with the v8 engine one has 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.100
 6 152 kw performance 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:59.010
 if I give you full throttle then you have to 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:03.060
 I say then I have a bit of that 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:07.260
 feel like you have special chair 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:08.760
 but once I have a race start 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:13.350
 made 

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:15.810
 I was already at the limit that I 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:18.240
 come a bit blackout but it 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:21.620
 is unbelievable for normal people 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:21.620
 then that can not be imagined 

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:32.110
 the Porsche 918 spyder 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:34.480
 supercar looking for its peers 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:37.110
 who would not like to have him with him 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.110
 standing by the door 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.570
 Finally, my conclusion is one 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:46.120
 certainly no human needs one 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:47.830
 such car but I would like one 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.910
 and with this wish I am with 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.910
 safety not alone
