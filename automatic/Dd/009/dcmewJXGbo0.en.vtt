00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.170 
few ones have been really quick so this
was<00:01:50.100> probably<00:01:50.250> got<00:01:50.490> me<00:01:50.549> really<00:01:50.670> quick<00:01:50.880> as<00:01:51.000> well

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
was probably got me really quick as well

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.649 
was probably got me really quick as well
but<00:01:51.750> from<00:01:51.930> what<00:01:52.049> I<00:01:52.110> understand<00:01:52.680> they<00:01:52.979> have

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
but from what I understand they have

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.510 
but from what I understand they have
because<00:01:54.659> I<00:01:54.689> think<00:01:55.049> they've<00:01:55.200> released<00:01:55.520> two

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
because I think they've released two

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.789 
because I think they've released two
movies<00:01:57.090> in<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.360> in<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:57.810> hobbit<00:01:58.350> trilogy<00:01:58.500> that

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
movies in the in the hobbit trilogy that

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.100 
movies in the in the hobbit trilogy that
they're<00:01:59.040> planning<00:01:59.369> on<00:01:59.460> doing<00:01:59.840> and<00:02:00.840> I<00:02:00.869> think

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
they're planning on doing and I think

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.560 
they're planning on doing and I think
it's<00:02:01.200> kind<00:02:01.350> of<00:02:01.469> dumb<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:02.009> it's<00:02:02.969> it's<00:02:03.240> it's

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
it's kind of dumb and it's it's it's

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:04.880 
it's kind of dumb and it's it's it's
silly<00:02:03.869> they<00:02:04.079> should<00:02:04.259> have<00:02:04.350> waited<00:02:04.500> till<00:02:04.740> all

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
silly they should have waited till all

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.499 
silly they should have waited till all
three<00:02:05.250> came<00:02:05.490> out<00:02:05.670> but<00:02:06.149> what<00:02:06.299> they're<00:02:06.479> doing

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
three came out but what they're doing

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:07.940 
three came out but what they're doing
this<00:02:07.140> is<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:07.290> rumor

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
this is a rumor

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.930 
this is a rumor
I<00:02:07.979> don't<00:02:08.190> know<00:02:08.250> if<00:02:08.340> it's<00:02:08.459> hunter<00:02:08.670> set<00:02:08.879> fact<00:02:09.179> but

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
I don't know if it's hunter set fact but

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.699 
I don't know if it's hunter set fact but

again<00:02:20.099> I<00:02:20.250> don't<00:02:20.340> know<00:02:20.519> why<00:02:20.700> they<00:02:20.879> wouldn't

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
again I don't know why they wouldn't

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.640 
again I don't know why they wouldn't
just<00:02:21.300> wait<00:02:21.480> till<00:02:21.660> the<00:02:21.690> third<00:02:21.959> movie<00:02:22.140> came<00:02:22.470> out

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
just wait till the third movie came out

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.320 
just wait till the third movie came out
and<00:02:22.950> then<00:02:23.040> they<00:02:23.129> can<00:02:23.280> release<00:02:23.489> it<00:02:23.550> at<00:02:23.790> once<00:02:24.030> but

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
and then they can release it at once but

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.720 
and then they can release it at once but
that's<00:02:24.569> how<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.780> cash<00:02:25.470> grab<00:02:25.800> but<00:02:26.489> I<00:02:26.519> don't

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730
