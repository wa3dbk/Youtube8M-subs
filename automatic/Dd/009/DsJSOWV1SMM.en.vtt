back whenever you want to and these are
the<00:01:49.560> little<00:01:49.799> sensor<00:01:50.579> I<00:01:50.850> guess<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.180> sensors

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
the little sensor I guess the sensors

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.850 
the little sensor I guess the sensors
for<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.740> tachikoma<00:01:54.170> let's<00:01:55.170> look<00:01:55.439> at<00:01:55.530> that<00:01:55.649> it

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
for the tachikoma let's look at that it

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.370 
for the tachikoma let's look at that it
just<00:01:55.979> rotates<00:01:56.310> we<00:01:57.240> can<00:01:57.450> move<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.750> there<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.259> it

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
just rotates we can move it there and it

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.389 
just rotates we can move it there and it
needs<00:01:58.560> erection<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.340> that's<00:01:59.880> nice<00:02:01.340> it's<00:02:02.340> the

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
needs erection and that's nice it's the

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.910 
needs erection and that's nice it's the
same<00:02:03.259> for<00:02:04.259> each<00:02:04.350> of<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:05.009> sensors

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.030 

and<00:02:09.180> oh<00:02:10.180> the<00:02:10.990> legs

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
and oh the legs

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:19.440 
and oh the legs
it<00:02:12.160> can<00:02:12.340> also<00:02:12.460> be<00:02:12.900> rotated<00:02:13.900> as<00:02:13.990> well<00:02:18.450> rotate

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
it can also be rotated as well rotate

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.490 
it can also be rotated as well rotate
rotate<00:02:19.990> all<00:02:20.590> the<00:02:20.650> way<00:02:20.800> around

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
see that it's it's extended out just a

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.770 
see that it's it's extended out just a
little<00:02:40.480> bit

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
little bit

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.170 
little bit
all<00:02:41.530> of<00:02:41.740> these<00:02:41.860> wheels<00:02:42.130> can<00:02:42.340> be<00:02:42.550> replaced<00:02:43.090> with

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
all of these wheels can be replaced with

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.500 
all of these wheels can be replaced with
a<00:02:46.180> different<00:02:46.420> set<00:02:47.820> so<00:02:48.820> this<00:02:48.940> is<00:02:49.090> the<00:02:49.180> different

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
a different set so this is the different

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.410 
a different set so this is the different
set<00:02:49.780> as<00:02:50.080> you<00:02:50.230> can<00:02:50.350> see<00:02:50.440> the<00:02:50.530> wheels<00:02:50.709> aren't

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
set as you can see the wheels aren't

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.260 
set as you can see the wheels aren't
sticking<00:02:52.420> out<00:02:52.510> that<00:02:52.690> much<00:02:53.940> you<00:02:54.940> see<00:02:55.060> there's<00:02:55.240> a

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
sticking out that much you see there's a

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:56.670 
sticking out that much you see there's a
little<00:02:55.390> groove<00:02:55.750> right<00:02:55.780> there<00:02:55.959> you<00:02:56.380> just<00:02:56.560> put

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
little groove right there you just put

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.880 
little groove right there you just put
them<00:02:57.040> into<00:02:58.140> so<00:02:59.140> I'm<00:02:59.200> gonna<00:02:59.320> replay<00:02:59.650> we're

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
them into so I'm gonna replay we're

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.460

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:31.860 
wheels I believe that was the style of
the<00:03:11.769> first<00:03:12.310> season<00:03:12.959> so<00:03:27.390> and<00:03:29.430> the<00:03:30.570> cannon<00:03:31.570> can

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.470 
the first season so and the cannon can
be<00:03:32.050> replaced<00:03:32.410> with<00:03:32.680> this<00:03:33.580> Gatling<00:03:34.060> gun<00:03:34.300> I

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
be replaced with this Gatling gun I

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:07.400 
had the opportunity and I think that is

had the opportunity and I think that is
about<00:07:07.669> it<00:07:08.150> it<00:07:08.300> also<00:07:08.419> comes<00:07:08.720> with<00:07:08.780> a<00:07:08.870> sticker

about it it also comes with a sticker

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:14.309 
about it it also comes with a sticker
sheet<00:07:10.539> I'm<00:07:11.539> not<00:07:12.169> sure<00:07:12.440> what<00:07:12.740> this<00:07:12.919> says<00:07:13.340> so

00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:14.319
