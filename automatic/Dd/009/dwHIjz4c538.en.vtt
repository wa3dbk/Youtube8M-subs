00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:22.260
 one of the most novel reforms of the 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.150
 Bologna plan has been the introduction of 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.010
 a subject called work end of 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.090
 degree that can be of a theoretical nature 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.090
 or practical application 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.239
 this course reveals the tasks of 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.860

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.699
 public offers the main techniques 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.219
 of research that are used in 

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:47.920
 social sciences as well as the sources 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:49.720

 public exhibition of work 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.300
 is conceived with a universal approach 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.100

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.760
 this course aims to be a guide that 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.560
 offer guidance and guidelines for 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.160
 the completion of an end job 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.080

 work as junior researchers 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.229
 you will find guidelines answers and 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.149
 models to follow for the project end of

 advanced a doctoral thesis or a 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.200
 scientific article will receive help for 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:46.970
 select the most suitable sources in 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.229
 those that find useful information and 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.229
 relevant to the chosen topic 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.360
 with the incorporation of internet to 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.860
 our lives the documentation and the 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.720
 information is multiplied in all 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.610
 knowledge areas do searches 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.770
 effective and select the contents 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.810
 appropriate and dismiss everything that 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.960
 not relevant to our work is 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.960
 fundamental 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.440
 what differentiates a job from 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.840
 investigation of another type 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.840
 informative is the choice of a method 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.370
 in any research work in 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.799
 communication are especially useful 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.580
 Research techniques and methods 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:27.379
 quantitative 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.299
 today these techniques have to be 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:31.159
 perform through data analysis 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:34.069
 that are made with software 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:35.900
 specialized called s pss through 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:37.670
 practical cases applied to the world of 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.410
 communication these techniques are 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.570
 they will learn much better 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.210
 we will go into each of the 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.950
 quantitative and qualitative methods 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:48.900
 so that the student decides which one is 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.650
 better adapts to achieving the 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.650
 proposed purposes 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.450
 Qualitative research houses 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:00.010
 paradigms and methodological strategies 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.430
 conducive to the interpretation of data 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.980
 that will lead us to understand 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.530
 example intentionality and why 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.200
 the people or groups analyzed act 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.140
 the way this analysis works 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.910
 qualitative applied in communication 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.069
 is assisted by a series of programs 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.980
 IT among which we can 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:24.880
 highlight the atlast program and that 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:27.819
 allows coding analyze and reduce 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:30.190
 data and relate the results that 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:34.090
 we have found both graphics and 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:36.310
 written another aspect that should not be 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.819
 neglect is an adequate wording of the 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.819
 document 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.580
 no doubt the relationship is a point 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.140
 key in all research work 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.060
 we have to keep in mind that it is very 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.830
 important to choose the methodology 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.690
 objectives but once everything is 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.850
 prepared there is a cover letter 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.800
 there is a way to serve that product that 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.620
 We cooked and the wording must 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.020
 have a clear concrete wording 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.970
 clearly evidently with a spelling 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:04.010
 exquisite and that's what you see in this 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.950
 section of the course that I take care of is 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:09.740
 how to write a job correctly 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.530
 of scientific academic research is 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:14.780
 say with rigor and always in a clear way 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.190
 direct and above all informative 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.290
 essays no doubt a point 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.570
 key 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:22.640
 thanks to a pedagogical team of 6 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.050
 teachers the science students of 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.750
 the communication that they have never 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.190
 conducted a scientific investigation 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:31.390
 will receive the necessary training to 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.390
 undertake it successfully 

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:35.699
 once the project for 

00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:37.949
 research the course offers the keys 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:40.529
 recommendations and guidelines for a 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:43.529
 correct presentation and defense before the 

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:45.119
 court in addition the course emphasizes 

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:46.979
 in those aspects of communication 

00:04:45.119 --> 00:04:49.379
 verbal as are the edition and 

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:51.059
 modulation and nonverbal as it can be 

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:54.229
 for example the dress to make 

00:04:51.059 --> 00:04:54.229
 solvent speech 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.690
 do not
