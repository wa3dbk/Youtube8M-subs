the positioning my insect mounting pin

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:46.729 
the positioning my insect mounting pin
is<00:00:43.859> going<00:00:44.249> to<00:00:44.460> go<00:00:44.609> in<00:00:44.909> the<00:00:45.120> thorax<00:00:45.739> straight

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
is going to go in the thorax straight

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:53.630 
is going to go in the thorax straight
down<00:00:49.429> coming<00:00:50.429> out<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.760> other<00:00:50.940> end<00:00:51.409> and<00:00:52.609> what<00:00:53.609> I

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
down coming out the other end and what I

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.319 
down coming out the other end and what I
want<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.120> do<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:54.659> make<00:00:54.960> sure<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.639> I<00:00:56.639> put<00:00:57.089> him

want to do is make sure that I put him

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.489 
want to do is make sure that I put him
in<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:58.199> spreading<00:00:58.649> board<00:00:59.100> groove<00:01:00.229> nice<00:01:01.229> and

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:01.499 
in the spreading board groove nice and

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:05.299 
in the spreading board groove nice and
straight<00:01:03.379> we<00:01:04.379> don't<00:01:04.589> want<00:01:04.799> him<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:04.979> do<00:01:05.280> a

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
straight we don't want him to do a

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.720 
straight we don't want him to do a
nosedive<00:01:06.290> or<00:01:07.290> look<00:01:07.680> like<00:01:07.710> he's<00:01:08.130> an<00:01:08.280> airplane

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:08.730 
nosedive or look like he's an airplane

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:16.999 
nosedive or look like he's an airplane
taking<00:01:09.120> off

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.320 

and<00:01:18.009> then<00:01:19.000> I'm<00:01:19.180> going<00:01:19.540> to<00:01:19.570> pin<00:01:20.409> both<00:01:20.890> sides<00:01:21.400> of

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
and then I'm going to pin both sides of

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:32.490 
and then I'm going to pin both sides of
his<00:01:23.259> wings<00:01:23.619> on<00:01:24.040> the<00:01:24.250> board<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:31.720> closer<00:01:32.080> you

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
his wings on the board the closer you

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.690 
his wings on the board the closer you
pin<00:01:33.070> to<00:01:33.940> the<00:01:34.119> groove<00:01:34.450> the<00:01:34.810> better<00:01:35.070> it<00:01:36.070> is<00:01:36.399> the

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
pin to the groove the better it is the

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.310 
pin to the groove the better it is the
easier<00:01:37.119> it'll<00:01:37.450> be<00:01:37.509> to<00:01:37.960> mount<00:01:38.259> the<00:01:38.440> wings<00:01:40.320> we

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
easier it'll be to mount the wings we

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:51.990 
easier it'll be to mount the wings we
could<00:01:41.530> gently<00:01:43.080> touch<00:01:44.080> the<00:01:44.110> wings<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:51.000> what

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
could gently touch the wings and what

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.620 
could gently touch the wings and what
I'm<00:01:52.149> going<00:01:52.390> to<00:01:52.450> do<00:01:52.690> now<00:01:52.960> since<00:01:53.500> he's<00:01:53.770> all<00:01:54.630> held

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
I'm going to do now since he's all held

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:56.249 
I'm going to do now since he's all held
down

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
down

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:58.529 
down
I<00:01:56.289> want<00:01:56.590> to<00:01:56.740> position<00:01:57.100> each<00:01:57.520> of<00:01:57.909> the<00:01:58.090> wings<00:01:58.300> the

00:01:58.529 --> 00:01:58.539 
I want to position each of the wings the

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:02.520 
I want to position each of the wings the
way<00:01:58.780> they're<00:01:58.960> supposed<00:01:59.350> to<00:01:59.470> be<00:02:01.110> so<00:02:02.110> I'm<00:02:02.259> going

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
way they're supposed to be so I'm going

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:10.350 
way they're supposed to be so I'm going
to<00:02:02.590> gently<00:02:02.950> scoot<00:02:04.170> this<00:02:05.170> wing<00:02:08.399> him<00:02:09.399> close<00:02:09.940> but

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
to gently scoot this wing him close but

to gently scoot this wing him close but
not<00:02:10.600> through<00:02:11.470> the<00:02:11.500> wing<00:02:11.920> and<00:02:13.440> we<00:02:14.440> have<00:02:14.650> a

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
not through the wing and we have a

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.030 
not through the wing and we have a
slight<00:02:15.190> V<00:02:15.580> here<00:02:16.049> that<00:02:17.049> we're<00:02:17.230> going<00:02:17.590> to<00:02:17.680> be

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
slight V here that we're going to be

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.620 
slight V here that we're going to be
doing<00:02:18.489> and<00:02:18.700> I'm<00:02:18.910> scooting<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:20.140> hind<00:02:20.410> wing<00:02:20.739> up

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
doing and I'm scooting the hind wing up

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:25.710 
doing and I'm scooting the hind wing up
and<00:02:23.070> I'm<00:02:24.070> going<00:02:24.310> to<00:02:24.370> put<00:02:24.610> a<00:02:24.640> glass<00:02:24.880> slide<00:02:25.329> on

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
and I'm going to put a glass slide on

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.530 
and I'm going to put a glass slide on
top<00:02:26.140> to<00:02:26.380> hold<00:02:26.530> it<00:02:26.769> down<00:02:27.360> the<00:02:28.360> other<00:02:28.570> side

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
top to hold it down the other side

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.690 
top to hold it down the other side
scooting<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:32.560> wing<00:02:34.650> to<00:02:35.650> where<00:02:35.829> I<00:02:35.859> want<00:02:36.250> him<00:02:36.459> to

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
scooting the wing to where I want him to

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:43.610 
scooting the wing to where I want him to
be<00:02:37.590> him<00:02:38.590> near<00:02:39.100> but<00:02:39.340> not<00:02:39.370> through<00:02:39.880> the<00:02:39.910> wing<00:02:42.239> and

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
be him near but not through the wing and

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.199 
be him near but not through the wing and
again<00:02:44.620> we're<00:02:45.040> going<00:02:45.250> to<00:02:45.370> scoot<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:48.489> hind<00:02:48.850> wing

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
again we're going to scoot the hind wing

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:58.290 
again we're going to scoot the hind wing
up<00:02:51.150> pin<00:02:52.150> it<00:02:52.299> close<00:02:52.660> but<00:02:53.019> not<00:02:53.230> through

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.050 

hold<00:02:59.300> it<00:02:59.450> down<00:02:59.660> with<00:02:59.900> a<00:02:59.930> slide<00:03:00.820> now<00:03:01.820> I've

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
hold it down with a slide now I've

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.260 
hold it down with a slide now I've
noticed<00:03:02.440> that<00:03:03.440> I<00:03:03.470> can<00:03:03.860> barely<00:03:04.580> see<00:03:04.850> his<00:03:04.970> head

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
noticed that I can barely see his head

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.540 
noticed that I can barely see his head
so<00:03:05.750> I<00:03:05.780> want<00:03:06.110> to<00:03:06.200> go<00:03:06.350> in<00:03:06.590> here<00:03:07.010> with<00:03:07.790> a<00:03:07.820> pin<00:03:09.550> close

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
so I want to go in here with a pin close

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:15.370 
so I want to go in here with a pin close
to<00:03:10.850> his<00:03:11.030> head<00:03:11.270> and<00:03:12.230> hold<00:03:13.070> the<00:03:13.250> wing<00:03:13.990> down<00:03:14.990> a

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
to his head and hold the wing down a

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.460 
to his head and hold the wing down a
little<00:03:15.710> bit<00:03:16.060> and<00:03:17.060> now<00:03:17.390> we've<00:03:17.660> got<00:03:17.930> two

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
little bit and now we've got two

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.470 
little bit and now we've got two
antennas<00:03:19.370> that<00:03:19.400> we<00:03:19.910> want<00:03:20.180> to<00:03:21.940> work<00:03:22.940> with<00:03:23.270> we

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
antennas that we want to work with we

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.390 
antennas that we want to work with we
want<00:03:23.750> a<00:03:23.960> V<00:03:24.200> that's<00:03:24.590> what<00:03:24.800> we're<00:03:24.950> trying<00:03:25.190> to

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
want a V that's what we're trying to

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.160 
want a V that's what we're trying to
achieve

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
achieve

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.550 
achieve
so<00:03:27.170> using<00:03:27.560> cross<00:03:28.190> pins<00:03:28.730> or<00:03:29.480> pins<00:03:30.020> that<00:03:30.260> are<00:03:30.320> in
