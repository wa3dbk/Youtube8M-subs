00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:16.539
 It is from the second phase 

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:18.839
 In unfortunate stone 

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:21.230
 That's about it 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.470
 It's a bit different and it looks like it's sunny. 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.230
 Not 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.339
 I think 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:30.829
 A little from now 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:33.460
 Third to people 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.310
 There is capacity 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.220
 Because there is a horizontal line 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.220
 Weigh the horizon 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.040
 I'm off the line 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.610
 This wearz hey yeah 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.020
 It's a part of the sea 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.110
 It's right I'll make up for the sky 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.290
 To identify the market 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.110
 Yeah 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.300
 High from now 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.300
 like this 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.570
 It is a little dark color 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.480
 On the side of the sea 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.520
 End 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.360
 Put on 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.740
 I'm going 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.170
 Use of this ruler is a stroke of the left and right 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.670
 Scarecrow- 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.340
 I will go fluorescent 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.860
 That use of Musashibetsu palace is that 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:29.920
 Because there is not 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.920
 It is convenient during the alt key gun of that color 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.260
 Now that strike 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.320
 The site itself is 62 cents 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.080
 To make it come alive 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.550
 Dark color 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.550
 It's a bag itself 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.550
 That 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.830
 I will continue to color 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:56.720
 f1 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.970
 Emphasizing the dark three parts 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.970
 In that bright part 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.670
 Reaction asserts 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.139
 f 

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:13.200
 Like this 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.970
 The run of the headquarters headquarters run for a moment 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.069
 Though 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:19.629
 Something like this 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:21.440
 That future 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.649
 I will repeat London 

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:26.150
 Brightness 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:27.699
 Nomination this time 

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:30.699
 The result is farmland improvement interior 

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:32.369
 Mr. Ando 

00:02:32.369 --> 00:02:35.369
 I will ride 

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:39.439
 In this country a little brighter color king hand 

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:43.229
 There is a paint of bright color, though 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:46.599
 It is such a green 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:48.139
 giano 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:51.059
 I will consult with you here 

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:54.059
 Please take a good look and go home 

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:58.659
 With a brush to go a little 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:02.399
 Battle of this fall 

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:03.839
 Do the whole 

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:05.259
 Commodity available 

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:07.029
 Misunderstand 

00:03:07.029 --> 00:03:08.929
 I will tele 

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:11.929
 The horizon itself is also that 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:15.789
 Though it will be Moka city 

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:17.649
 Yeah well that 

00:03:17.649 --> 00:03:20.649
 I will go with basketball 

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:28.099
 Now cmmi is clearly undecided 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:30.779
 I came because 

00:03:30.779 --> 00:03:32.749
 that 

00:03:32.749 --> 00:03:34.349
 A little bright 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:38.239
 There is no sense of elasticity and dismantling of maa, but that 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:41.289
 Left side of the club 

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:42.139
 small 

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:44.959
 27 minutes 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.959
 I am injured 

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:57.449
 It is this around 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.709
 Korea and the US are gunman points within the month 

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:10.659
 Also this work 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:12.089
 Second semester is free 

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:14.539
 But I 

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:17.620
 The shape of the cloud is 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.769
 I have to do research to the extent that there is no power 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:27.539
 That time zone same period tax savings second form is different 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.590
 Me too 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.270
 About 9 thousand photographs of the whole country 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.710
 It is a reservoir 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.479
 that 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:40.809
 However, the chairperson was standing for 10 days and was in the state of Hikaru Togawa 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.330
 I do a lot of research on such things 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.150
 That's right 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.150
 If you turn your mind to the uniqueness Yano 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:56.720
 When it is in China in 2007, such a spider is out 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.700
 It is said that it is this kind of color that it is difficult for many of this daytime 

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:06.159
 You will come to understand 

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:11.249
 There is really nothing like that in the movie 

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:15.869
 China is like this in the past experience 

00:05:15.869 --> 00:05:17.529
 It is called 

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:19.370
 that 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.420
 I have a monologue Ogushio 

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:24.680
 In my head 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.680
 I am getting related 

00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:36.949
 At the contour of the cloud's light at aero sunset 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:38.529
 There is light 

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:39.839
 Coming out 

00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:43.259
 Ocarina I hope you can see that 

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:50.969
 eh 

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:55.309
 If you make full use of the room, you already have a good feeling 

00:05:55.309 --> 00:05:56.139
 I will 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:58.469
 Add Nasri 

00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:59.830
 I made good use of 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:01.039
 It was still 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:04.619
 Put that line where you want to emphasize that blur and 

00:06:04.619 --> 00:06:06.819
 Repetition of saying 

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:10.069
 I think it will be 

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:13.120
 Guidance of bar code reader 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.619
 I think so, though 

00:06:14.619 --> 00:06:18.539
 If I do that a little more I wonder if it's wireless to some extent 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:19.610
 In a word 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.610
 think 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:31.000
 It is that and how to blur that 

00:06:32.219 --> 00:06:35.710
 I'm going to boke this year but 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:39.430
 Cotton swabs are not suitable to move the defense force 

00:06:40.119 --> 00:06:43.129
 It's good for moving small places, though 

00:06:44.059 --> 00:06:47.039
 When I move the house a lot 

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:49.309
 I wrote Otsuka 

00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:51.110
 Security nas 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:54.839
 Small place as you got used to cotton swabs rolled locally 

00:06:57.009 --> 00:06:57.819
 Toho Gas 

00:06:57.819 --> 00:07:00.419
 That's what it means 

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:03.419
 That's right for that 

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.940
 About this 

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:14.199
 But near completion 

00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:17.369
 To attach 

00:07:17.369 --> 00:07:18.580
 How is it 

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.849
 I wonder about 85% 

00:07:25.559 --> 00:07:28.559
 Put some more hands 

00:07:34.039 --> 00:07:37.039
 I will explain this is a big deal 

00:07:37.559 --> 00:07:39.639
 I want to finish the sum
