00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.630
 let's go to the recovery mode 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:25.649

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.560
 The recovery mode enters the new cover and is 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.440
 pressing the power key volume 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:42.810
 up and the middle button until 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:44.970
 appear the logo of samsung galaxy 6 us 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.610
 release those three buttons for nothing 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.720
 until the logo appears or is right now 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.270

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.260
 and good until one is quite stable there 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.050
 have any bug 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.909
 they do not have anything just to follow the steps 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.219
 just as it is 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.439
 because if you do not explain the phone 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:08.470
 and good for those who do not like it 

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:12.989
 I'm going to have another video where I'm going to 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:16.239

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:27.390
 to the recovery mode 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:30.090
 the good thing is these two folders that 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.690
 I left to download the video below 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:36.780
 they put in the root of the start they are not going to 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.910
 put in folders or anything in the root 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.520
 The first thing they will do is install 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.040
 the flower rec that is called one that is a 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.620
 recovery 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.650
 and good to install that they have to 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:51.439
 put they have to put update promedie 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.910
 card selected with the medium they move 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:59.070
 with the volume 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:00.540
 and they are looking for the cloud world s 58 to 30 

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:04.830
 m 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:07.310
 if once they find that from me the 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:12.010
 case is the fourth if the fourth place 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:15.549
 they put it ok and install it and this appears 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.659
 once this has appeared they are going to 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:20.530
 be the following 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:22.500
 and eye they take into account they are going to put wild to 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.910

 ok they are going to put is is going to put that 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:36.650

 they are going to ride estruch 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:42.790
 good way was to put data form and form 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.219

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:48.189

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:53.310
 is going to restart is a process 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:57.830
 totally easy, it will not take longer 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:59.840
 more than 5 minutes 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.450

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.960

 Pretty fluid is very good I love it 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:11.030
 just that some things there are some 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:15.110
 trash apps but with link 2 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:16.550
 cc of eliminate those garbage applications 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.600

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:24.050

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:26.830
 galaxy light that are are practically 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:30.160
 garbage applications that is already as they see 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.160
 is learning 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:37.469
 in saying they will not always despair 

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:39.479
 it takes the cell phone to always undertake 

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:41.729
 because it is a new system do not forget 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:44.520
 and it always takes 

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:47.169
 once that seems like the android 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:50.060
 everything to fix 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:53.540
 to configure better said 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:55.610
 and that's the whole video, that's all 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:59.470
 what they have to do I hope that they 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:02.580
