alright I was asked to show how to make
a<00:01:09.570> button<00:01:10.200> ring<00:01:10.380> using<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.729> button<00:01:12.540> with<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.780> bail

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
a button ring using a button with a bail

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.109 
a button ring using a button with a bail
instead<00:01:13.710> of<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.890> for<00:01:14.130> hold<00:01:14.340> button<00:01:14.640> like<00:01:14.970> I

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
instead of a for hold button like I

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.300 
instead of a for hold button like I
showed<00:01:15.450> in<00:01:15.750> my<00:01:15.780> beaded<00:01:16.380> button<00:01:16.650> ring<00:01:16.799> tutorial

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
so it's not that much different the only

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.960 
so it's not that much different the only
thing<00:01:21.390> that's<00:01:21.570> different<00:01:21.689> is<00:01:22.110> just<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.560> base

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
thing that's different is just the base

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.700 
thing that's different is just the base
for<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.090> button<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.630> then<00:01:25.140> everything<00:01:25.590> else

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
for the button and then everything else

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.550 
for the button and then everything else
is<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.280> same<00:01:26.640> as<00:01:26.939> my<00:01:27.840> betta<00:01:28.140> button<00:01:28.409> ring

bunch ink is so large and I found that

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.970 
bunch ink is so large and I found that
if<00:03:10.500> I<00:03:10.530> put<00:03:11.250> this<00:03:11.489> bead<00:03:11.820> in<00:03:12.000> there<00:03:12.380> it<00:03:13.380> will<00:03:13.709> um

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
if I put this bead in there it will um

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.070 
if I put this bead in there it will um
keep<00:03:14.549> the<00:03:14.760> shape<00:03:15.060> of<00:03:15.269> the<00:03:15.390> button<00:03:15.720> more<00:03:15.870> so

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
keep the shape of the button more so

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.810 
keep the shape of the button more so
it's<00:03:16.230> more<00:03:16.410> square<00:03:16.890> so<00:03:17.190> when<00:03:17.340> you<00:03:17.459> go<00:03:17.580> to<00:03:17.610> do

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
it's more square so when you go to do

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:24.590 
it's more square so when you go to do
the<00:03:17.940> ring<00:03:18.209> it'll<00:03:19.140> be<00:03:19.549> more<00:03:20.780> organized<00:03:21.780> um<00:03:23.570> so<00:03:24.570> I

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
the ring it'll be more organized um so I

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.470 
the ring it'll be more organized um so I
slid<00:03:24.989> my<00:03:25.019> red<00:03:25.380> seed<00:03:25.980> bead<00:03:26.160> on<00:03:26.340> there<00:03:26.579> and<00:03:26.820> I'm

filling in the button shank holes so
that's<00:05:19.990> why<00:05:20.319> I<00:05:20.879> did<00:05:21.879> it<00:05:21.999> like<00:05:22.149> that<00:05:22.419> because<00:05:22.659> it

00:05:22.799 --> 00:05:22.809 
that's why I did it like that because it

00:05:22.809 --> 00:05:27.510 
that's why I did it like that because it
makes<00:05:23.469> the<00:05:23.680> ring<00:05:23.830> more<00:05:24.069> square<00:05:24.509> so<00:05:26.159> both<00:05:27.159> of<00:05:27.369> my

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
makes the ring more square so both of my

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.149 
makes the ring more square so both of my
strings<00:05:27.969> you're<00:05:28.209> exiting<00:05:28.629> out<00:05:28.839> of<00:05:29.020> black<00:05:29.860> seed

00:05:30.149 --> 00:05:30.159 
strings you're exiting out of black seed

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:32.040 
strings you're exiting out of black seed
beads<00:05:30.399> right<00:05:30.639> here<00:05:30.939> I'm<00:05:31.330> going<00:05:31.569> to<00:05:31.629> take<00:05:31.869> both

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
beads right here I'm going to take both

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:40.980 
beads right here I'm going to take both
of<00:05:32.289> my<00:05:32.409> strings<00:05:32.860> and<00:05:33.189> pick<00:05:33.430> up<00:05:35.039> two<00:05:36.039> blue<00:05:39.990> and

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
of my strings and pick up two blue and

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.739 
of my strings and pick up two blue and
then<00:05:41.199> I'm<00:05:41.289> going<00:05:41.469> to<00:05:41.529> pick<00:05:41.680> up<00:05:41.800> two<00:05:41.860> black<00:05:42.749> and

00:05:43.739 --> 00:05:43.749 
then I'm going to pick up two black and

00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:50.390 
then I'm going to pick up two black and
crossed<00:05:44.050> it<00:05:44.259> down

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:57.770 

pull<00:05:51.300> it<00:05:51.449> up

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.560 

strain<00:05:58.740> it<00:05:58.889> up<00:05:59.010> I<00:05:59.280> should<00:05:59.910> look<00:06:00.150> just<00:06:00.210> like

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:00.570 
strain it up I should look just like

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:04.160 
strain it up I should look just like
that<00:06:02.150> so<00:06:03.150> you<00:06:03.210> just<00:06:03.450> kind<00:06:03.660> of<00:06:03.720> continue<00:06:04.139> on

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:04.170 
that so you just kind of continue on

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:06.110 
that so you just kind of continue on
you're<00:06:04.500> going<00:06:04.650> to<00:06:04.710> pick<00:06:04.889> up<00:06:05.100> just<00:06:05.940> as<00:06:06.090> you

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 
you're going to pick up just as you

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.540 
you're going to pick up just as you
would<00:06:06.450> if<00:06:06.720> you<00:06:06.960> were<00:06:07.380> doing<00:06:07.410> the<00:06:08.040> other<00:06:08.280> ring

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
would if you were doing the other ring

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:12.620 
would if you were doing the other ring
with<00:06:08.700> Falls<00:06:09.000> a<00:06:09.300> seed<00:06:09.630> bead<00:06:10.040> your<00:06:11.060> run<00:06:12.060> bead<00:06:12.330> a

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:12.630 
with Falls a seed bead your run bead a

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:15.710 
with Falls a seed bead your run bead a
seed<00:06:13.139> bead<00:06:13.320> and<00:06:13.650> you<00:06:14.580> would<00:06:14.700> go<00:06:14.880> through<00:06:15.330> the

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:15.720 
seed bead and you would go through the

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:26.140 
seed bead and you would go through the
next<00:06:15.990> two<00:06:16.500> seed<00:06:16.800> beads<00:06:17.070> over<00:06:17.340> here

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:40.340 
seed bead and go through the two seed

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.330 
seed bead and go through the two seed
beads<00:06:40.370> over<00:06:40.699> here<00:06:40.850> on<00:06:40.940> the<00:06:41.030> side<00:06:41.830> pull<00:06:42.830> it<00:06:42.979> snug
