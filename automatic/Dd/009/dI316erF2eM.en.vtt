the<00:00:23.580> graphics<00:00:24.300> size<00:00:24.779> in<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.080> menu<00:00:25.619> which<00:00:25.859> is

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
the graphics size in the menu which is

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.720 
the graphics size in the menu which is
something<00:00:26.699> I'm<00:00:26.970> kind<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.269> disappointed<00:00:27.539> about

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
something I'm kind of disappointed about

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.970 
something I'm kind of disappointed about
there's<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:30.029> lot<00:00:30.449> of<00:00:30.480> odd<00:00:31.109> buttons<00:00:31.619> at<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.830> top

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
there's a lot of odd buttons at the top

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.920 
there's a lot of odd buttons at the top
that<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.369> haven't<00:00:32.610> actually<00:00:32.850> sort<00:00:33.329> of<00:00:33.420> explored

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
that I haven't actually sort of explored

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.690 
that I haven't actually sort of explored
mainly<00:00:34.410> because<00:00:34.559> most<00:00:35.070> of<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.399> time<00:00:35.550> they

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
mainly because most of the time they

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.670 
mainly because most of the time they
seem<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:35.910> be<00:00:36.030> locked<00:00:36.329> off<00:00:36.660> so<00:00:36.930> I<00:00:36.960> can't<00:00:37.230> explore

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
seem to be locked off so I can't explore

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.160 
seem to be locked off so I can't explore
them<00:00:37.920> I<00:00:38.180> wish<00:00:39.180> them<00:00:39.420> in<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:39.629> would<00:00:39.809> expect

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
them I wish them in you would expect

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.200 
them I wish them in you would expect
that's<00:00:40.620> how<00:00:40.950> long's<00:00:41.129> up<00:00:41.460> there<00:00:41.760> seems<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.120> be

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
that's how long's up there seems to be

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.319 
that's how long's up there seems to be
like<00:00:42.829> points<00:00:43.829> you<00:00:43.950> can<00:00:43.980> buy<00:00:44.340> everything<00:00:44.760> to

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
like points you can buy everything to

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.709 
like points you can buy everything to
get<00:00:45.570> extra<00:00:45.930> stuff<00:00:46.230> but<00:00:46.700> let's<00:00:47.700> just<00:00:48.030> connect

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.479 
in and show you guys a bit of gameplay
footage<00:00:51.230> it<00:00:52.230> has<00:00:52.410> this<00:00:52.649> weird<00:00:52.890> sort<00:00:53.399> of

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
footage it has this weird sort of

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.400 
footage it has this weird sort of
matchmaking<00:00:53.969> thing<00:00:54.329> people<00:00:54.780> already<00:00:55.050> in<00:00:55.260> the

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
matchmaking thing people already in the

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.900 
matchmaking thing people already in the
game<00:00:55.590> but<00:00:55.770> I<00:00:55.829> have<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.190> wait<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.430> certain<00:00:56.670> amount

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
game but I have to wait a certain amount

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.270 
game but I have to wait a certain amount
of<00:00:57.030> time<00:00:57.180> for<00:00:57.239> head<00:00:57.780> start<00:00:58.050> not<00:00:58.829> sure<00:00:59.070> what

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
of time for head start not sure what

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.569 
of time for head start not sure what
that<00:00:59.309> is<00:00:59.520> but<00:01:00.829> as<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:02.010> can<00:01:02.100> see<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.399> is

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
that is but as you can see it is

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.579 
that is but as you can see it is
actually<00:01:02.969> sort<00:01:03.510> of<00:01:03.570> full<00:01:03.780> screened<00:01:04.140> within

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
actually sort of full screened within

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.100 
actually sort of full screened within
the<00:01:04.710> game<00:01:05.150> so<00:01:06.150> it's<00:01:06.330> only<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.689> menu<00:01:07.080> that

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
the game so it's only the menu that

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.070 
the game so it's only the menu that
essentially<00:01:07.770> doesn't<00:01:08.070> resize<00:01:08.659> the<00:01:09.659> game

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
essentially doesn't resize the game

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.950 
essentially doesn't resize the game
graphics<00:01:10.439> aren't<00:01:11.220> that<00:01:11.880> brilliant<00:01:12.510> but<00:01:12.689> I

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
graphics aren't that brilliant but I

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.149 
graphics aren't that brilliant but I
mean<00:01:13.170> they're<00:01:13.470> not<00:01:13.650> bad<00:01:13.890> especially

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
mean they're not bad especially

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.870 
mean they're not bad especially
considering<00:01:15.090> this<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.450> free-to-play<00:01:15.780> game

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
considering this is a free-to-play game

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.190 
considering this is a free-to-play game
it's<00:01:17.880> kind<00:01:18.330> of<00:01:18.420> reminiscent<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:18.990> old

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
it's kind of reminiscent of old

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.840 
it's kind of reminiscent of old
counter-strike<00:01:19.799> it's<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.130> bit<00:01:20.310> like<00:01:20.490> yelling

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
counter-strike it's a bit like yelling

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.140 
counter-strike it's a bit like yelling
in<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.689> UK<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.200> this<00:01:22.380> is<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.560> US<00:01:23.040> server<00:01:23.430> so<00:01:23.850> on

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
in the UK and this is a US server so on

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.300 
in the UK and this is a US server so on
probably<00:01:25.110> not<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.409> best<00:01:25.439> choice<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:26.009> server

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
probably not the best choice of server

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.370 
probably not the best choice of server
to<00:01:26.580> join<00:01:26.850> on<00:01:27.150> my<00:01:27.360> part<00:01:27.689> but<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.170> works<00:01:29.180> and<00:01:30.380> Ivan

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
to join on my part but it works and Ivan

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.899 
to join on my part but it works and Ivan
actually<00:01:31.680> played<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.040> styled<00:01:32.400> match<00:01:32.610> before

actually played the styled match before
there<00:01:33.329> seems<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.720> be<00:01:33.810> quite<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.200> range<00:01:34.500> of<00:01:34.710> match

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
out chairs mostly kind of death match

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.270 
out chairs mostly kind of death match
though<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:47.360> well<00:01:48.439> you<00:01:49.439> can't<00:01:49.649> actually<00:01:49.799> do<00:01:50.159> it

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
though and well you can't actually do it

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.520 
though and well you can't actually do it
in<00:01:50.369> this<00:01:50.549> type<00:01:50.790> of<00:01:50.820> match<00:01:51.060> but<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.409> whole

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
in this type of match but the whole

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.319 
in this type of match but the whole
reason<00:01:52.770> as<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.220> why<00:01:53.460> it's<00:01:53.579> called<00:01:53.729> wolf<00:01:54.000> team

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
reason as to why it's called wolf team

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.410 
reason as to why it's called wolf team
is<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:54.869> can<00:01:55.049> transform<00:01:55.829> into<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.399> werewolf<00:01:56.909> in

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
is you can transform into a werewolf in

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
health which is a bit of an odd number

health which is a bit of an odd number
I'm<00:02:27.319> not<00:02:27.650> sure<00:02:27.709> what<00:02:28.100> it's<00:02:28.489> not<00:02:28.700> 100<00:02:29.000> but<00:02:29.360> it's

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
I'm not sure what it's not 100 but it's

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.530 
I'm not sure what it's not 100 but it's
200<00:02:30.860> it<00:02:31.040> doesn't<00:02:31.550> really<00:02:31.760> change<00:02:31.850> the<00:02:32.330> game

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
200 it doesn't really change the game

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.380 
200 it doesn't really change the game
mechanics<00:02:33.080> that<00:02:33.140> much<00:02:33.500> because<00:02:33.940> the<00:02:34.940> damage

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
mechanics that much because the damage

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.910 
mechanics that much because the damage
is<00:02:35.510> still<00:02:35.750> relevant<00:02:36.110> to<00:02:36.470> the<00:02:36.650> amount<00:02:36.860> of

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
is still relevant to the amount of

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.520 
is still relevant to the amount of
health<00:02:37.130> you<00:02:37.340> have<00:02:37.550> but<00:02:38.080> this<00:02:39.080> seems<00:02:39.319> a<00:02:39.440> little

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
health you have but this seems a little

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.170 
health you have but this seems a little
strange<00:02:40.720> yeah<00:02:42.040> team<00:02:43.040> is<00:02:43.310> now<00:02:43.580> winning<00:02:44.060> ooh

if<00:03:43.579> I<00:03:43.760> mean<00:03:43.940> you<00:03:44.150> get<00:03:44.600> like<00:03:45.010> this<00:03:46.010> endgame<00:03:46.489> kind

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
if I mean you get like this endgame kind

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.180 
if I mean you get like this endgame kind
of<00:03:46.940> currency<00:03:47.209> that<00:03:47.450> can<00:03:47.930> be<00:03:48.230> used<00:03:48.350> by<00:03:48.650> upgrades

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
of currency that can be used by upgrades

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.940 
of currency that can be used by upgrades
and<00:03:49.459> such<00:03:49.670> as<00:03:50.120> far<00:03:50.359> as<00:03:50.480> I'm<00:03:50.569> aware<00:03:50.600> i<00:03:51.049> think

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
and such as far as I'm aware i think

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.759 
and such as far as I'm aware i think
it's<00:03:52.130> just<00:03:52.340> well<00:03:53.150> I<00:03:53.180> fail<00:03:53.569> but<00:03:54.290> i<00:03:54.350> think<00:03:54.650> it's

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
it's just well I fail but i think it's

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:57.569 
it's just well I fail but i think it's
used<00:03:54.980> to<00:03:55.100> buy<00:03:55.220> upgrades<00:03:55.370> and<00:03:55.910> that<00:03:56.440> which

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
used to buy upgrades and that which

00:03:57.579 --> 00:03:59.830 
used to buy upgrades and that which
might<00:03:58.579> be<00:03:58.609> used<00:03:58.850> to<00:03:58.940> buy<00:03:59.030> new<00:03:59.209> weapons<00:03:59.390> as<00:03:59.720> well

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
might be used to buy new weapons as well

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.440 
might be used to buy new weapons as well
i<00:03:59.900> think<00:04:00.079> i<00:04:00.470> remember<00:04:01.100> how<00:04:01.730> to<00:04:01.790> quick<00:04:02.060> look<00:04:02.299> at

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
i think i remember how to quick look at

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.960

let's<00:04:34.880> all<00:04:35.720> just<00:04:36.110> how<00:04:36.530> we<00:04:36.820> go<00:04:38.080> yep<00:04:39.080> it's<00:04:39.350> not

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
let's all just how we go yep it's not

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.480 
let's all just how we go yep it's not
loaded<00:04:40.130> this<00:04:40.430> area<00:04:41.890> I'm<00:04:42.890> not<00:04:43.070> sure<00:04:43.130> why<00:04:43.460> that

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
loaded this area I'm not sure why that

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.850 
loaded this area I'm not sure why that
was<00:04:43.760> a<00:04:44.000> team<00:04:44.420> here<00:04:44.690> the<00:04:44.960> gaming<00:04:45.320> itself<00:04:45.650> like

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
was a team here the gaming itself like

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.490 
was a team here the gaming itself like
when<00:04:46.040> it<00:04:46.160> launches<00:04:46.520> into<00:04:46.940> the<00:04:47.150> 25<00:04:47.780> psycho<00:04:48.260> back

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
when it launches into the 25 psycho back

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.200 
when it launches into the 25 psycho back
to<00:04:48.710> windows<00:04:49.100> and<00:04:49.340> then<00:04:49.460> flick<00:04:49.700> back<00:04:49.910> to<00:04:50.120> the

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
to windows and then flick back to the

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.170 
to windows and then flick back to the
game<00:04:50.390> so<00:04:50.750> I'm<00:04:51.310> thinking<00:04:52.310> that's<00:04:52.460> why<00:04:52.820> it<00:04:52.880> just

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
game so I'm thinking that's why it just

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:57.280 
game so I'm thinking that's why it just
messed<00:04:53.480> up<00:04:53.720> quite<00:04:54.140> a<00:04:54.170> bit<00:04:54.500> there<00:04:55.480> so<00:04:56.480> sorry

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
messed up quite a bit there so sorry

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.680 
messed up quite a bit there so sorry
about<00:04:57.500> that<00:04:57.650> it<00:04:58.130> assuming<00:04:58.910> a<00:04:59.060> little<00:04:59.540> because

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
about that it assuming a little because

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.990 
about that it assuming a little because
