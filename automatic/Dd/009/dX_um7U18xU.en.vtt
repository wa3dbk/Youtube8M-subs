 not everyone can answer it honestly 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:24.239
 speaking really 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.049

 parents and their maybe even grandmothers and 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.759

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:52.789
 who can and world such 

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:55.149
 on this space 

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:57.339
 because I have been asking for so long 

00:02:57.339 --> 00:03:00.339
 I didn't say a word 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.149

 many guys 

00:03:46.119 --> 00:03:48.979

00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:52.169
 it will be interesting to know 

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:55.169
 and even more wanted to match 

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:58.699
 when that is 

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:18.439
 what would you like to be when you grow up 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.990
 need with a programmer

 literally in 20 minutes 

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:23.639
 as our program 

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:26.639
 had to go on the air 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.150
 a cassette hit you 

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:33.839

00:06:36.119 --> 00:06:38.139
 perhaps the most mysterious 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:41.139
 20th century km 

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:48.279
