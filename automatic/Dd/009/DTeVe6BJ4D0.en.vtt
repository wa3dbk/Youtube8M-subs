00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.030
 cut for speed is only for 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.820
 doors that you made up the 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.650
 France evening fauns Alain Chopard has 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.360
 recruited in england this son of night 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.130
 shift with a mother by which marc not 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.199
 only for his pedigree his precocity 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.390
 where his very high level performances 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.859
 on the sprint at two and three years but 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.000
 because he had distinguished himself 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.279
 immediately as a stallion 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.710
 we are not the horse I had 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.359
 contacts with the Tierney Court and at 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.460
 departure we did not leave to see if 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.829
 I believe that the Taiwanese horse and on 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.520
 the road this same time that finally in 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.500
 England I was no longer a kind of 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.969
 farm see this famous horse deportivo 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.170
 that we do not want to see at the beginning and 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.489
 when I saw the model I buy 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.660
 that was really the type choice 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.820
 what I really like to do 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.440
 the two years old horses fast and with 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.149
 dow with thickness with and lo 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.550
 really wanting really really 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.020
 beautiful what are we doing 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.399
 to be wrong a little I think we believe 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.379
 that it was going to make miles but 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.309
 sends for the first ones who started 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.409
 that's all the Smurfs are going to get 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.330
 lengthen that will go on 12 14 and 16 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.970
 the first five that started they 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.170
 all end their races what we c 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.119
 see that it's going to lengthen that's okay 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.549
 to be even better on 12 14 and 16 and 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.780
 maybe even more 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.770
 it's not a name in production for 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.270
 the moment what we see for 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.619
 the moment is not especially a 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.930
 good sprinter it's obvious because we 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.570
 already has a month of racing there was one 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.070
 to start and for the same fact quickly they 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.150
 were early there is no China there 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.180
 appears like a winter china where 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.890
 I already have my system I'm already 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.040
 enormously the stallions there must be 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.880
 50 of products I have 25 26 to me when 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.090
 I say it's good that I'm there 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.679
 believe me already 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.100
 because my dessailly is easy 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:43.750
 but sell pillar protrusions to 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.399
 my stallion is very good but 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.350
 with my players play elsewhere it's 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:48.840
 not my style if I know very well these 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:55.450
 diamonds that takes more risks this 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:57.069
 nerve deportivo released for his first 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.289
