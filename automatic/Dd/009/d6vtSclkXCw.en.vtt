00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:15.049
 today as he does himself and with 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.520
 a string of lights spiced up everything 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:20.779
 you need a few for that 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:23.540
 Balloons just wallpaper paste one 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:27.079
 scissors glitter dust and one 

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:29.090
 The first thing you do is cut the light string 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:32.320
 from the line eight to ten meters 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.730
 , and it soaks in wallpaper glue needed 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.980

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.870

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.440
 get out again and stick the glue 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:49.340

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:51.520
 just around the balloon the whole 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.470
 then it looks like here you can do that 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.270
 hang balloon and glue as long as possible 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.880
 Moist is some glitter over it 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:02.000
 then you let the whole dry and 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.230
 then it goes on here the threads are 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.810

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.490

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.219
 what has to do now is the 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:13.420
 to puncture the balloon and out of the 

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:13.420
 thread out 

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:20.570

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.100
 normal 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.720

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.740

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.790
