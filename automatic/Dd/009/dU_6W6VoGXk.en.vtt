00:00:00.609 --> 00:00:05.370
 hello again from painter what if come from other new video tutorial 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.340
 in which I'll show you how to get this bar posted on the mac 

00:00:10.739 --> 00:00:13.139
 which is quite simple and 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.139
 what can give us all the options that are worth 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.380
 I'm going to let the interest charge in the description for you to see 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.380
 and good is not that I have it and downloaded and installed 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.519
 Well, here we should give a little bit, it's very simple 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:30.029
 how does it work 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.090
 as you see, you have many options 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.760
 sounds task to generate advanced options position the behavior 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.660
 the first thing we can choose 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.530
 is where we want this event 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.790
 if we have to be left 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.790
 we want you down or right going up 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.960
 I work every year 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.420
 and align the doc 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.989
 to that of the water screen the stopped medium 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:57.740
 zelaya but we could 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.020
 put a little more there goes for there is worth 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.360
 behavior to these high options 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.500
 and then separate the gift of the bora from the glove pixel abbot I have put 0 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.500
 to test justito with the edge of the screen 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.539
 and good for you this is pretty easy to look 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:19.800
 The size of the dr icons 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.120
 it is not the size it is if when the mouse passes but when 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.070
 to set disabled 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.070
 it's 35 pixels 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.670
 the egg the images reflected the size 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.050
 the space between the icons 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.490
 the opacity of the whole 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.490
 labels when overlaying mouse 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.310
 the name as you see photos or 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.950
 images videos 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.870
 and well this is quite simple in lct effects we want 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.470
 get when we hang out I'm afraid to magnify we can put by 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:58.820
 example approach 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.370
 well he explained it 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:01.320
 ccoo and is 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.320
 the surrounding ones do not manifest themselves as before or near 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.220
 I had a Czech position 

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:12.340
 i 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.249
 conjugate the effect we can vary the socialists who were looking for 

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:18.109
 on issues 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:21.659
 well this can no longer look at the other ft is focused on the circular 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.719
 fluid surfaces 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:25.549
 fluid reflection 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:28.549
 it lies younger we have enough 

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:33.089
 to apply them or doc 

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:37.089
 we can even download more themes store this web page 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.779
 valerie I have leopard on 

00:02:39.779 --> 00:02:42.779
 and apart from the issues like yes but we have 

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:46.569
 and you should apply would be discovered from a simple mosaic 

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:50.929
 I think that much better if we go or not 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.509
 and also larios not to third parties and although wallpapers 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:58.239
 is to conjugate the double 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.599
 contemplating if I gave this 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:04.599
 as you see and we would put to this fund 

00:03:06.919 --> 00:03:11.169
 and good to get away as you see you are going to have more funds are fine 

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:16.619
 but some are small and because of that 

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:19.079
 he does not stay down said 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.529
 leave this moment background 

00:03:21.529 --> 00:03:24.119
 sounds 

00:03:24.119 --> 00:03:25.669
 we can choose 

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:29.009
 the sound we want for this option of the two pallets 

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:32.069
 I fear he got into all the levels and voices because I did not 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:34.519
 there will be much to say 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.709
 and well we can also put some voice themes 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.209
 Chile Sep 20 and just harden tutoring on how to install it 

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:43.829
 all the Libyan people to follow 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:44.729
 chores 

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:47.549
 we can show slow that the applications that are currently in 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:48.929
 execution if I give it 

00:03:48.929 --> 00:03:51.739
 activate this option as neighbors open 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.329
 here a space and I have open 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.159
 the kamikaze walk 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:59.159
 preferences the field study 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:02.769
 I'm going to remove it 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:08.159
 I am afraid posthumously to show pieces in their execution as thumbnails of windows 

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:13.309
 but since I do not have how you can activate this option 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:16.840
 now there is nothing 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.529
 task groups do not occupy similar tasks all this is based 

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:24.309
 the site motivates this option is worth it if we do not activate all this is not going to 

00:04:24.309 --> 00:04:25.919
 Serve your natanz plant 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:28.930
 then the general delay of the occultation of the doc 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.930
 if we want or when we click on another tab 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.689
 love is gone 

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:37.689
 Well, like tigers, the time it takes in faith 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:40.889
 that effect the speed in actions 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:44.530
 if I punctured and bounced it go faster more slowly 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.080
 we can disable all administrations here 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:52.740
 and here the predefined commands that are to execute nexus at the start of the 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:53.979
 system 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:55.509
 shows the 'nexus one' icon 

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:57.259
 in the notification area 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:04:58.789
 and other options 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:02.619
 delay setting or screen so that it is not right here and when going out 

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:06.469
 measure the time it takes to leave 

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:07.370
 i 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:10.339
 access to the reference part to propose 

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:13.339
 a command in which we want 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.150
 to access nexus 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.279
 the advanced internet options 

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:21.360
 they would be basically from the hyper 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.599
 wait for them to be made on the ecam without a card 

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:27.599
 notify me about art updates 

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:32.449
 the performance to the resolution of problems and we have some failure in a 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:33.979
 his 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:38.259
 and about her not having manna to love they only stopped for reference so change the 

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:41.569
 color a little 

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:44.509
 and well, this must be known to leave the real 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:47.309
 As you can see, this duo is pretty good 

00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:50.610
 and I forgot to tell you one thing if you want 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:51.970
 apart from this doctor 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:54.099
 the nexus ultimate 

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:58.930
 which is supposed to be for sale and 4 but if you want I leave a link of meo 

00:05:58.929 --> 00:06:02.339
 float 'I will not leave the description 

00:06:02.339 --> 00:06:06.289
 includes several options such as putting several docs a bench other 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:07.740
 here 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.969
 the minister here 

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:12.330
 to be able to activate it 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.499
 nor are we going to wilster's interest 

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:18.360
 which is to configure beyond a little the possible inflation 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.029
 from your desktop it's worth 

00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:23.589
 well up here I'm tutorial I hope you liked it and I hope so 

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:24.629
 next until next time
