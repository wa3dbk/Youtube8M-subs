00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
so when you're doing it just tied those

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.340 
so when you're doing it just tied those
up<00:01:13.700> you<00:01:13.909> can<00:01:14.360> get<00:01:14.570> a<00:01:14.630> little<00:01:14.780> scuff<00:01:15.049> now<00:01:15.229> and

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:58.480 
musical instrument and you're going to
use<00:01:56.090> your<00:01:56.270> handbrake<00:01:56.630> to<00:01:57.259> govern<00:01:57.619> the<00:01:58.009> amounts

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
use your handbrake to govern the amounts

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.580 
use your handbrake to govern the amounts
that<00:01:58.880> the<00:01:59.030> back<00:01:59.270> end<00:01:59.450> comes<00:01:59.719> round<00:01:59.929> and<00:02:00.469> you

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
that the back end comes round and you

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.069 
that the back end comes round and you
actually<00:02:00.770> let<00:02:01.100> the<00:02:01.219> car<00:02:01.460> steer<00:02:02.210> in<00:02:02.600> and<00:02:02.929> then

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
actually let the car steer in and then

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:05.289 
actually let the car steer in and then
pull<00:02:03.259> the<00:02:03.350> handbrake<00:02:03.560> on<00:02:03.770> again<00:02:04.090> so<00:02:05.090> that<00:02:05.240> you

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
pull the handbrake on again so that you

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:06.910 
pull the handbrake on again so that you
end<00:02:05.420> up<00:02:05.569> in<00:02:05.749> the<00:02:05.869> gut<00:02:06.079> I<00:02:06.259> should<00:02:06.710> be<00:02:06.799> writing

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
end up in the gut I should be writing

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.919 
end up in the gut I should be writing
this<00:02:07.159> down<00:02:07.219> and<00:02:07.609> taking<00:02:07.939> notes<00:02:08.179> I'm<00:02:08.420> just

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
this down and taking notes I'm just

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.600 
this down and taking notes I'm just
doing<00:02:09.110> a<00:02:09.170> handbrake<00:02:09.530> turn<00:02:09.590> I<00:02:09.890> think<00:02:10.220> worse<00:02:10.399> is

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
doing a handbrake turn I think worse is

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.070 
doing a handbrake turn I think worse is
much<00:02:10.789> much<00:02:11.120> science<00:02:11.630> involved

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
much much science involved

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.390 
much much science involved
now<00:02:12.200> I<00:02:12.230> think<00:02:12.319> the<00:02:12.470> best<00:02:12.620> thing<00:02:12.800> to<00:02:12.830> do<00:02:12.980> is<00:02:13.160> if<00:02:13.280> i

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
now I think the best thing to do is if i

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.770 
now I think the best thing to do is if i
sim<00:02:13.640> extra<00:02:13.910> now<00:02:14.060> and<00:02:14.180> you<00:02:14.240> just<00:02:14.270> show<00:02:14.600> me<00:02:14.750> how

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
sim extra now and you just show me how

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:25.740 
sim extra now and you just show me how
to<00:02:14.930> do<00:02:15.140> it<00:02:15.170> okay<00:02:15.620> we<00:02:15.830> do<00:02:15.950> that<00:02:16.100> yep

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.980 

so<00:02:26.750> happens<00:02:27.380> at<00:02:27.470> the<00:02:27.530> end<00:02:27.680> quickly<00:02:28.450> yes<00:02:29.450> I<00:02:29.780> know

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
so happens at the end quickly yes I know

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.480 
so happens at the end quickly yes I know
