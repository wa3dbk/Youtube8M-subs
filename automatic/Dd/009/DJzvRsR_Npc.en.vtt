but other than the body I've added this

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.890 
but other than the body I've added this
rear<00:01:22.950> spoiler<00:01:23.580> which<00:01:23.820> I've<00:01:24.000> taken<00:01:24.240> off<00:01:24.570> or

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
rear spoiler which I've taken off or

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.469 
rear spoiler which I've taken off or
taken<00:01:25.320> off<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.500> hbi

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
taken off a hbi

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.359 
taken off a hbi
spread<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.659> sport<00:01:28.080> body<00:01:28.350> shell<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:29.040> was<00:01:29.159> just

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
spread to sport body shell it was just

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.649 
spread to sport body shell it was just
on<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.610> back<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:29.970> I<00:01:30.000> thought<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.240> might<00:01:30.299> like<00:01:30.630> a

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
on the back and I thought I might like a

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.990 
on the back and I thought I might like a
nice<00:01:30.900> addition<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.560> rough<00:01:32.369> slide<00:01:32.670> just<00:01:32.850> the

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
nice addition to a rough slide just the

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.999 
nice addition to a rough slide just the
way<00:01:34.009> it<00:01:35.009> overall<00:01:35.400> looks<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:36.320> it<00:01:37.320> does<00:01:37.530> help<00:01:37.770> it

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
way it overall looks and it does help it

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.179 
way it overall looks and it does help it
doesn't<00:01:38.310> pick<00:01:39.119> up<00:01:39.299> as<00:01:39.890> much<00:01:41.240> as<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:42.390> used<00:01:42.420> to

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
doesn't pick up as much as it used to

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:46.010 
doesn't pick up as much as it used to
without<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.490> spoiler<00:01:44.880> will<00:01:45.329> standard<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.840> lot

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
without the spoiler will standard a lot

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.780 
without the spoiler will standard a lot
and<00:01:46.200> surprisingly<00:01:46.799> this<00:01:47.070> spoiler<00:01:47.460> keeps<00:01:47.670> it

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
and surprisingly this spoiler keeps it

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.330 
and surprisingly this spoiler keeps it
down<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:47.970> lot<00:01:48.210> that's<00:01:48.899> pretty<00:01:49.170> good<00:01:49.320> as<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:50.159> can

it<00:03:58.220> pretty<00:03:58.880> pretty<00:03:59.480> badly<00:03:59.750> and<00:04:00.200> the<00:04:01.190> miter<00:04:01.460> and

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
it pretty pretty badly and the miter and

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.520 
it pretty pretty badly and the miter and
speed<00:04:02.180> control<00:04:02.330> that<00:04:02.810> was<00:04:02.900> still<00:04:03.110> perfectly

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
speed control that was still perfectly

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.010 
speed control that was still perfectly
fine<00:04:03.800> so<00:04:03.950> I<00:04:04.100> said<00:04:04.310> I'll<00:04:04.490> I'll<00:04:04.940> bite<00:04:05.540> off<00:04:05.780> you'll

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.020 
fine so I said I'll I'll bite off you'll

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:07.930 
fine so I said I'll I'll bite off you'll
do<00:04:06.710> a<00:04:06.740> deal<00:04:07.010> or<00:04:07.130> something<00:04:07.460> like<00:04:07.580> that<00:04:07.640> and

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
do a deal or something like that and

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.390 
do a deal or something like that and
that's<00:04:08.120> how<00:04:08.240> I<00:04:08.300> got<00:04:08.570> these<00:04:08.950> all<00:04:09.950> got<00:04:10.220> the

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
that's how I got these all got the

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.600 
that's how I got these all got the

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
I've just got a couple extra pieces the

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.190 
I've just got a couple extra pieces the
little<00:04:54.910> protection<00:04:55.910> bar<00:04:56.240> for<00:04:56.480> the<00:04:56.570> case<00:04:56.780> of

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
little protection bar for the case of

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.580 
little protection bar for the case of
the<00:04:57.290> motor<00:04:57.470> and<00:04:57.830> the<00:04:58.460> wheelie<00:04:58.790> bar<00:04:59.000> for<00:04:59.420> those

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
the motor and the wheelie bar for those

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.320 
the motor and the wheelie bar for those
on<00:05:00.590> road<00:05:00.920> races<00:05:01.370> or<00:05:01.550> even<00:05:01.910> when<00:05:02.030> you're<00:05:02.180> in<00:05:02.210> the

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
on road races or even when you're in the

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.030 
on road races or even when you're in the
dirt<00:05:02.540> you<00:05:02.570> can<00:05:02.840> still<00:05:03.050> use<00:05:03.230> a<00:05:03.260> wheelie<00:05:03.530> bar<00:05:03.800> but

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.040 
dirt you can still use a wheelie bar but

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.910 
dirt you can still use a wheelie bar but
then<00:05:04.370> white<00:05:04.550> grab<00:05:05.360> will<00:05:05.630> slow<00:05:05.810> it<00:05:05.870> down<00:05:05.990> a<00:05:06.140> bit

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:06.920 
then white grab will slow it down a bit

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.940 
then white grab will slow it down a bit
stuff<00:05:07.520> like<00:05:07.700> that<00:05:08.140> next<00:05:09.140> up<00:05:09.290> around<00:05:09.530> hoping<00:05:09.740> to

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:09.950 
stuff like that next up around hoping to

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.370 
stuff like that next up around hoping to
get<00:05:10.070> next<00:05:10.520> is<00:05:10.670> a<00:05:10.700> 2.4<00:05:11.420> gigahertz<00:05:11.690> remote<00:05:12.230> I'm

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
get next is a 2.4 gigahertz remote I'm

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.900 
get next is a 2.4 gigahertz remote I'm
just<00:05:12.560> using<00:05:12.770> the<00:05:13.180> standard<00:05:14.180> TQ<00:05:14.660> Traxxas<00:05:15.170> right

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:15.910 
just using the standard TQ Traxxas right

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.140 
just using the standard TQ Traxxas right
as<00:05:17.530> you<00:05:18.530> would<00:05:18.740> use<00:05:19.160> with<00:05:19.400> the<00:05:19.520> brush<00:05:19.730> version

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
as you would use with the brush version

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.780 
as you would use with the brush version
of<00:05:20.270> the<00:05:20.360> traxxas<00:05:20.720> rustler<00:05:20.750> but<00:05:21.350> and<00:05:22.340> hopefully

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:22.790 
of the traxxas rustler but and hopefully

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:27.640 
of the traxxas rustler but and hopefully
i'll<00:05:23.500> actually<00:05:24.500> boil<00:05:25.630> 2.4<00:05:26.630> gigahertz<00:05:26.930> the<00:05:27.500> new

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
i'll actually boil 2.4 gigahertz the new

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.770 
i'll actually boil 2.4 gigahertz the new
TQ<00:05:28.220> truck<00:05:29.030> this<00:05:29.210> remote

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
TQ truck this remote

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.090 
TQ truck this remote
that'll<00:05:30.200> be

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:31.100 
that'll be

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.550 
that'll be
to<00:05:31.340> use<00:05:31.600> you<00:05:32.600> don't<00:05:32.690> really<00:05:32.870> need<00:05:33.080> two<00:05:33.260> point

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
to use you don't really need two point

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.340 
to use you don't really need two point
four<00:05:33.740> gigahertz<00:05:34.040> like<00:05:34.660> that'll<00:05:35.660> get<00:05:36.110> you<00:05:36.230> as

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:36.350 
four gigahertz like that'll get you as

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:37.960 
four gigahertz like that'll get you as
far<00:05:36.380> enough<00:05:36.830> that<00:05:37.130> you<00:05:37.220> can't<00:05:37.430> see<00:05:37.640> the<00:05:37.790> cow

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
far enough that you can't see the cow
