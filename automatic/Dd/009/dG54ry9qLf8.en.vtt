00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 in the company of antoine coulon a 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.190
 marketing and service manager 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.500
 kawasaki motors france press on the 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.980
 stand exactly in akashi cant here at 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.809
 kite 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.849
 we are here in the presence of the 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.980
 kawasaki z1000 2014 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.320
 one of the first novelties unveiled 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.369
 by by kawasaki on this stand next 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.710
 we there on the left 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.140
 the scooter j 300 the first scooter of 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.670
 the honor mark on the motorcycle gentleman 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.740
 collomb listening to you some in 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.619
 a few words the technical evolutions 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.960
 and stylistics of this new roster 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:33.200
 yes and good hello to the whole team 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.239
 moto-net this machine actually 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.190
 evolved on many points 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.840
 in fact you all knew the z1000 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.969
 which has been a huge commercial success 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.879
 until today we wanted to evolve 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.770
 this machine is found on the chassis side 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.289
 and motor well known bases well 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.760
 proven and we will then see the 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.640
 evolutions that are deep enough 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.719
 so mechanical side first of all 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.210
 evolution so at the level of the box air 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.320
 of the injection of the cio if we won 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.750
 in power and 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.120
 countries that benefit from 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.250
 book versions will now have 142 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.020
 horses mechanical side so of 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.229
 very interesting performances 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:13.600
 chassis side we have evolutions so 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:17.110
 who are also very very sharp with the 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.450
 new fork sff bp in 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.979
 showa so that can win in 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.380
 maneuverability is to have a front train 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.360
 even more incisive and we also 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.880
 worked in a very consistent way 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:31.450
 on the rims with front rims and 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:34.210
 back which will win 2 kg in total 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.880
 so a machine that will be able to fight 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.289
 and confront the best of the 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.539
 European production so this is a 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:43.030
 machine in which one actually 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:44.470
 has very high hopes for this 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.850
 which then concerns the aspect 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.000
 stylistic as you can see 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.320
 we are going very far on the design 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.910
 something very decided from 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.580
 extreme stress of braids or comics 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:57.039
 as we say in Japanese so one side 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:00.070
 wild animals ready to pounce on new 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:02.140
 headlights a front part so equipped with 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.670
 LED headlights very very powerful and which 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.520
 are actually going to be invariably 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.619
 a very beautiful aesthetic signature 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.230
 the back also and very slender and 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.180
 practical side we also worked 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.549
 interesting aspects namely a 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.410
 much longer sixth that goes 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:18.820
 actually afford can have 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.739
 a machine more pleasant to ride at 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.780
 daily and then also so a 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:25.180
 tank that will now benefit 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.709
 17 liters against 15 liters 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.640
 previously so here is a motorcycle 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:32.709
 who evolve who get better who on all 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.560
 the aspects actually really offers this 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.060
 which is better today 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.440
 available so very soon we 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.900
 let's go for a very big evening of 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.549
 launch on December 12th 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:44.170
 so at 7 pm in all the concessions 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:45.910
 de france our fans will be able to come 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.860
 discover those machines that will be 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.570
 available in three colors gray 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.299
 green as it is under the eyes the red 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:54.610
 is also black with respect 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.900
 the price we will be a tariff 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.040
 about 12000 euros 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.900
 so you were telling us precisely at 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.069
 level of engine evolutions not bad 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.530
 of high level evolutions 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.760
 2 cu at the rc box 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.099
 evolution is evolutions 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.019
 mechanics we have already known about the 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:09.909
 new z 1000 sx which is a 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.620
 little bit further this new z1000 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:12.689
 ethical precisely wanted to communicate us 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.150
 his tariff 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:17.950
 yes then the z1000sx so it will be 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.659
 positioned around 13 thousand 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.459
 euros and it will be available so in 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:23.439
 simultaneous it will be available so the 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.389
 December 12th for the big 

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:27.760
 launch party so and a half the 6th 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:30.659
 and half they will arrive in France so 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.280
 synchronously next month 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:34.959
 always on the kawasaki stand always 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.060
 with antoine coulon and in front of 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.620
 the first kawasaki scooter for the 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.849
 European market so I make it clear 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.439
 actually for the sharks walker 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:43.060
 because as you tell us 

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:44.560
 just now it's not quite 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.000
 the first scooter that kawasaki has 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.530
 product since you already had 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.419
 a decade with suzuki 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.310
 yes alexander in a few words 

00:03:49.419 --> 00:03:53.919
 actually on the j3 feels we have the 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.629
 pleasure to introduce you today 

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:58.209
 ten years ago there was a small partnership 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:04:00.069
 with suzuki so is a vehicle was 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.519
 sold in Japan there is the first for 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:02.489
 europe 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:05.109
 so it's 1.3 cubic centimeter 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:08.019
 single-cylinder 4- stroke a product that will 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:11.079
 so offer all the right abilities 

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:12.729
 to move around town to switch to 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:14.739
 daily we actually had 

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:16.870
 many requests from our 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:18.669
 kawasaki east customers who use the 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.829
 zx 10 on track on weekends or who make 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:22.270
 cross or enduro with cases x and 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.759
 that they actually needed a 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.979
 vehicle to make trips 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:28.270
 home-office every day me so 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:29.560
 it's a machine that will offer everything 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.449
 who is doing best today in 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.449
 Under protection features 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:36.280
 of carrying capacity the vehicle is going 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:37.870
 arrive pretty quickly now we 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.590
 will deliver which first machines in 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.889
 next January 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:45.009
 the price will be around 5000 euros 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:45.880
 so we can get it in three 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:48.520
 different colors 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.620
 we will have a gray we will have a black and we will 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:54.130
 will have this beautiful black two-tone color 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:56.500
 and green then in a few words 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.330
 technically so this scooter so he 

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.310
 is developed in collaboration with the 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.919
 kymco builder so this is a basic 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.669
 so had exciting 300 so a base 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:05.110
 engine and chassis 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:08.650
 what are the points that kawasaki 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:10.270
 improved except the dressing 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.830
 yes then we actually start from 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.509
 base which is quite well known 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.840
 proven very reliable very satisfactory 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:18.639
 compared to that so we redesigned 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.620
 the whole of this machine so that 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:22.090
 it is typically a kawasaki product 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.770
 we worked a lot by 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.900
 elsewhere the comfort aspect we have a whole 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.880
 new one offering cushioning 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.220
 absolutely excellent and then we go 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.320
 benefit also from damper being 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.550
 very progressive and offering 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.500
 what is best in terms of 

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.770
 comfort and amenity to future customers 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:41.260
 from this guy 300 little question that 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:43.289
 often comes back in the mouth under the 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:45.280
 Keyboard keys of our readers 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:47.830
 kawasaki conveys a sporty image 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.600
 very strong why not have this 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.610
 coming to the market of maxi scooters 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.320
 with a higher engine capacity we think 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:55.660
 especially to compete directly 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:58.389
 finally the famous tmax we find 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:00.130
 everywhere yes alexander very good 

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:02.440
 question actually I reassure you 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:03.250
 we think of other displacement to 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.990
 other categories 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:07.449
 you need to know is that gie 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:08.880
 300 so is a first step of kawasaki 

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:10.990
 in the urban vehicle universe 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.720
 it is the first stone of a great 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:16.210
 building time is given time 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:19.599
 and we decided to start so 

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:21.910
 with this displacement that have a lot of 

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:23.289
 success in the south of europe and which in 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:25.539
 two in France will allow us 

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:28.150
 to prime the pump is to start very 

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:30.099
 gradually once this pump 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.490
 long before that is what we can think of 

00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:32.490
 three wheels 

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:35.319
 so we'll have to wait a little 

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:37.659
 little it is really much too early 

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:40.659
 to talk about the products of the future but 

00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:42.159
 it's actually things that are 

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:44.529
 in reflection everything is evoked 

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:46.899
 today we actually opened with 

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:48.699
 this machine so a new segment 

00:06:46.899 --> 00:06:50.259
 as I told you right now 

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:51.339
 products intended for the city intended to 

00:06:50.259 --> 00:06:54.189
 urban mobility 

00:06:51.339 --> 00:06:56.129
 so stay tuned you will be one 

00:06:54.189 --> 00:06:59.819
 little more very soon 

00:06:56.129 --> 00:06:59.819
 thank you very much and good show
