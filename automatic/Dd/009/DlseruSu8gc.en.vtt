00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.750
 r 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.710
 The 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.620
 Hmm 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.290
 Ah 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:59.820
 Follow 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.680
 Follow 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:20.480
 Hmm 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:22.140
 I pulled my arm out and bought my arm here, and I turned the racket to the left with the back finger. 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:28.770
 I guess it's jumping up 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:30.200
 Everybody's an elbow and I serve it when I put it out before, but when I do it this way 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.869
 Saab 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:40.450
 From top to bottom with serving 5 serve while folding 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:44.900
 I can not do this wrists from the bottom of the racket to the top 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:51.380
 In reaction of this this child 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:56.540
 Kill your eyes to make it look like you're not replanting it here and not here 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:02:01.850
 Not by hitting the ball, but by showing the other side of the ball to the ball 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:04.890
 Came in here in the up-rotation finger was up rotation and with the state looking like a rotation 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:11.760
 In the rotation, which was now a racket that was thrown up above 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:18.840
 Up I feel that to twist snap a finger to go at once pretend pulled an oblique downward and forward 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:25.010
 If you swing seven rackets forward with the use of the exact opposite finger at the meeting 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:28.629
 Depending on to show the ball striking face to raise fit on to the other party at the moment of chopped 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.629
