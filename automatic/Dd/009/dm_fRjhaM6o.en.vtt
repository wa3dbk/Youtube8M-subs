00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
matt watson in the second half yeah i

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.120 
matt watson in the second half yeah i
think<00:00:18.320> important<00:00:19.320> that<00:00:19.440> we<00:00:19.590> want<00:00:19.800> that's

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
think important that we want that's

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.160 
think important that we want that's
first<00:00:20.610> thing<00:00:20.910> but<00:00:21.120> i<00:00:21.150> think<00:00:21.480> we<00:00:21.600> could<00:00:21.810> we

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
first thing but i think we could we

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.500 
first thing but i think we could we
could<00:00:22.320> score<00:00:22.560> more<00:00:22.770> goals<00:00:22.830> and<00:00:23.460> was<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.270> good

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
could score more goals and was a good

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.840 
could score more goals and was a good
test<00:00:24.690> for<00:00:24.870> everybody<00:00:25.410> but<00:00:25.620> first<00:00:25.980> off<00:00:26.190> we<00:00:26.490> had

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:26.850 
test for everybody but first off we had

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.640 
test for everybody but first off we had
a<00:00:26.880> really<00:00:27.300> good<00:00:27.510> health<00:00:27.750> but<00:00:27.990> i<00:00:28.050> think<00:00:28.380> we<00:00:28.500> had

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
a really good health but i think we had

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.580 
a really good health but i think we had
to<00:00:28.860> do<00:00:29.610> better<00:00:29.789> in<00:00:30.030> the<00:00:30.090> last<00:00:30.350> third<00:00:31.350> of<00:00:31.380> the

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
to do better in the last third of the

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.790 
to do better in the last third of the
pitch<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:32.039> scored<00:00:32.520> more<00:00:32.790> goals<00:00:32.850> but<00:00:33.440> it<00:00:34.440> was<00:00:34.770> a

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
pitch and scored more goals but it was a

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.650 
pitch and scored more goals but it was a
good<00:00:34.980> test<00:00:35.160> what<00:00:36.150> did<00:00:36.240> Martin<00:00:36.540> Rennie

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
situation so I felt like for the most

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.850 
situation so I felt like for the most
part<00:00:51.540> we<00:00:51.690> did<00:00:51.840> that<00:00:51.960> fairly<00:00:52.260> well<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.590> there's

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
part we did that fairly well and there's

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.170 
part we did that fairly well and there's
still<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.010> couple<00:00:53.130> things<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.670> know<00:00:53.790> that<00:00:54.059> we

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
still a couple things you know that we

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.580 
still a couple things you know that we
need<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.329> work<00:00:54.510> on<00:00:54.660> but<00:00:54.809> it's<00:00:54.960> early<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.350> I

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
need to work on but it's early and I

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.990 
need to work on but it's early and I
thought<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.100> school<00:00:56.309> played<00:00:56.520> real<00:00:56.700> well<00:00:56.820> you

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
thought the school played real well you

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.400 
thought the school played real well you
know<00:00:57.090> they<00:00:57.210> came<00:00:57.360> out<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.540> compete<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.230> play

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
know they came out to compete and play

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.900 
know they came out to compete and play
really<00:00:58.590> hard<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.130> definitely<00:00:59.370> match<00:00:59.730> their

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
really hard and definitely match their

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.930 
really hard and definitely match their
intensity<00:00:59.940> but<00:01:01.430> you<00:01:02.430> know<00:01:02.520> it's<00:01:02.670> good<00:01:02.790> to<00:01:02.880> get

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
intensity but you know it's good to get

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.280 
intensity but you know it's good to get
the<00:01:03.059> win<00:01:03.239> was<00:01:03.510> fun<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.750> play<00:01:03.899> in<00:01:03.989> front<00:01:04.079> of<00:01:04.199> a

thought we kept our composure even
though<00:01:09.030> we<00:01:09.150> had<00:01:09.270> 10<00:01:09.479> men<00:01:09.690> for<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:10.440> know<00:01:10.530> good
