were weaknesses on display no question
about<00:00:33.140> it

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
about it

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.060 
about it
however<00:00:34.910> every<00:00:35.630> fighter<00:00:35.900> has<00:00:36.140> weaknesses<00:00:36.680> is

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
however every fighter has weaknesses is

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.710 
however every fighter has weaknesses is
whether<00:00:37.460> or<00:00:37.700> not<00:00:37.730> their<00:00:38.030> opponents<00:00:38.570> can

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:38.720 
whether or not their opponents can

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.260 
whether or not their opponents can
exploit<00:00:39.200> those<00:00:39.410> weaknesses<00:00:40.070> and<00:00:40.730> based<00:00:41.090> on

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
exploit those weaknesses and based on

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.750 
exploit those weaknesses and based on
what<00:00:41.450> I<00:00:41.480> saw<00:00:41.750> tonight<00:00:41.989> I<00:00:42.290> think<00:00:42.410> and<00:00:43.010> this<00:00:43.700> is

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
what I saw tonight I think and this is

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.460 
what I saw tonight I think and this is
gonna<00:00:44.000> go<00:00:44.239> against<00:00:44.570> what<00:00:44.780> most<00:00:44.899> people<00:00:45.260> think

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:45.470 
gonna go against what most people think

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.000 
gonna go against what most people think
I<00:00:45.770> actually<00:00:46.220> think<00:00:46.670> that<00:00:46.820> Donna<00:00:47.149> Stevenson

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
I actually think that Donna Stevenson

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.819 
I actually think that Donna Stevenson
would<00:00:49.010> be<00:00:49.190> more<00:00:49.399> dangerous<00:00:49.880> for<00:00:50.530> bitter<00:00:51.530> bf

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
would be more dangerous for bitter bf

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.360 
would be more dangerous for bitter bf
then<00:00:52.760> Sergey<00:00:53.120> Kovalev<00:00:53.329> would<00:00:53.890> if<00:00:54.890> they<00:00:55.100> make

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
then Sergey Kovalev would if they make

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.350 
then Sergey Kovalev would if they make
butter<00:00:56.270> bf<00:00:56.540> against<00:00:56.840> Kovalev<00:00:57.640> I'll<00:00:58.640> be<00:00:59.030> more

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
butter bf against Kovalev I'll be more

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.740 
butter bf against Kovalev I'll be more
comfort<00:00:59.840> and<00:00:59.960> picking<00:01:00.290> bitter<00:01:00.590> beer<00:01:00.800> over

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
comfort and picking bitter beer over

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.329 
comfort and picking bitter beer over
kovalev<00:01:02.750> then<00:01:03.230> I<00:01:03.260> would<00:01:03.469> be<00:01:03.620> over<00:01:03.860> Stephenson

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
kovalev then I would be over Stephenson

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:05.439 
kovalev then I would be over Stephenson
again<00:01:04.549> most<00:01:04.729> people<00:01:04.939> are<00:01:05.030> gonna<00:01:05.149> disagree

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
again most people are gonna disagree

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:07.209 
again most people are gonna disagree
with<00:01:05.749> that<00:01:05.780> and<00:01:06.170> I<00:01:06.259> understand<00:01:06.770> that's<00:01:06.979> cool

00:01:07.209 --> 00:01:07.219 
with that and I understand that's cool

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:11.980 
with that and I understand that's cool
but<00:01:08.439> styles<00:01:09.439> make<00:01:09.649> fights<00:01:09.679> and<00:01:10.369> I<00:01:11.240> saw<00:01:11.539> certain

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
but styles make fights and I saw certain

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.989 
but styles make fights and I saw certain
angles<00:01:12.670> where<00:01:14.289> butter<00:01:15.289> beer<00:01:15.499> was<00:01:15.829> open<00:01:16.310> to<00:01:16.969> a

00:01:16.989 --> 00:01:16.999 
angles where butter beer was open to a

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:19.929 
angles where butter beer was open to a
southpaw<00:01:17.450> lef<00:01:18.130> whereas<00:01:19.130> against<00:01:19.459> Orthodox

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 
southpaw lef whereas against Orthodox

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:22.959 
southpaw lef whereas against Orthodox
fighters<00:01:20.119> I<00:01:20.509> think<00:01:20.779> his<00:01:21.560> defense<00:01:22.399> holds<00:01:22.759> up<00:01:22.850> a

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:22.969 
fighters I think his defense holds up a

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:23.529 
fighters I think his defense holds up a
little<00:01:23.179> better

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:23.539 
little better

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:25.959 
little better
there<00:01:24.439> was<00:01:24.560> also<00:01:24.859> moments<00:01:25.069> where<00:01:25.399> butabi<00:01:25.729> have

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:25.969 
there was also moments where butabi have

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:28.059 
there was also moments where butabi have
actually<00:01:26.869> turned<00:01:27.109> south<00:01:27.350> poor<00:01:27.619> himself

00:01:28.059 --> 00:01:28.069 
actually turned south poor himself

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:29.739 
actually turned south poor himself
because<00:01:28.670> he<00:01:28.789> found<00:01:28.969> out<00:01:29.179> it<00:01:29.270> was<00:01:29.389> easier<00:01:29.689> to

00:01:29.739 --> 00:01:29.749 
because he found out it was easier to

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:32.349 
because he found out it was easier to
land<00:01:30.189> from<00:01:31.189> that<00:01:31.399> position<00:01:31.880> he<00:01:31.969> could<00:01:32.090> land<00:01:32.209> a

00:01:32.349 --> 00:01:32.359 
land from that position he could land a

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:35.589 
land from that position he could land a
right<00:01:32.569> hook<00:01:32.719> up<00:01:32.929> front<00:01:33.229> and<00:01:33.439> a<00:01:33.979> left<00:01:34.420> left<00:01:35.420> hand

00:01:35.589 --> 00:01:35.599 
right hook up front and a left left hand

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:37.719 
right hook up front and a left left hand
from<00:01:35.659> the<00:01:35.810> southpaw<00:01:36.049> stance<00:01:36.439> so<00:01:36.770> he<00:01:37.340> did<00:01:37.520> a<00:01:37.549> few

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
from the southpaw stance so he did a few

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:39.219 
from the southpaw stance so he did a few
things<00:01:37.969> himself<00:01:38.090> in<00:01:38.479> there<00:01:38.630> he's<00:01:38.779> not<00:01:38.990> quite

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
things himself in there he's not quite

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.039 
things himself in there he's not quite
as<00:01:39.380> polished<00:01:39.679> as<00:01:40.450> some<00:01:41.450> people<00:01:41.599> would<00:01:41.869> like

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
as polished as some people would like

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:43.809 
as polished as some people would like
him<00:01:42.079> to<00:01:42.259> be<00:01:42.380> he's<00:01:42.889> a<00:01:42.920> little<00:01:43.249> bit<00:01:43.399> rough<00:01:43.639> a

00:01:43.809 --> 00:01:43.819 
him to be he's a little bit rough a

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:45.719 
him to be he's a little bit rough a
little<00:01:43.909> bit<00:01:44.179> raw<00:01:44.450> around<00:01:44.779> the<00:01:44.869> edges<00:01:45.229> but<00:01:45.409> I

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:45.729 
little bit raw around the edges but I

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:47.919 
little bit raw around the edges but I
still<00:01:46.729> think<00:01:46.969> he's<00:01:47.119> a<00:01:47.149> force<00:01:47.479> and<00:01:47.630> I<00:01:47.689> still

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:47.929 
still think he's a force and I still

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:50.019 
still think he's a force and I still
think<00:01:48.169> that<00:01:48.319> he's<00:01:48.469> ready<00:01:48.740> for<00:01:48.979> a<00:01:49.459> world<00:01:49.819> title

00:01:50.019 --> 00:01:50.029 
think that he's ready for a world title

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:53.969 
think that he's ready for a world title
fight<00:01:50.209> right<00:01:50.929> now<00:01:51.169> I<00:01:51.439> still<00:01:52.159> believe<00:01:52.219> that

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
fight right now I still believe that

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.870 
fight right now I still believe that
fighters<00:01:54.979> on<00:01:55.130> the<00:01:55.219> way<00:01:55.340> up<00:01:55.549> are<00:01:56.539> gonna<00:01:56.869> have

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
fighters on the way up are gonna have

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.489 
fighters on the way up are gonna have
opponents<00:01:58.880> who<00:01:58.999> are<00:01:59.090> gonna<00:01:59.270> make<00:02:00.079> them<00:02:00.289> look

00:02:00.489 --> 00:02:00.499 
opponents who are gonna make them look

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:02.830 
opponents who are gonna make them look
pedestrian<00:02:01.429> at<00:02:01.549> times<00:02:01.789> it's<00:02:02.450> gonna<00:02:02.599> happen

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
pedestrian at times it's gonna happen

put to the canvas and taken out of a

00:04:30.749 --> 00:04:30.759 
if he continues to improve and tightens

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:32.549 
if he continues to improve and tightens
up<00:04:30.849> the<00:04:30.909> defense<00:04:31.419> maybe<00:04:31.749> I'll<00:04:31.990> be<00:04:32.139> just<00:04:32.409> as

00:04:32.549 --> 00:04:32.559 
up the defense maybe I'll be just as

00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:35.119 
up the defense maybe I'll be just as
confident<00:04:33.039> as<00:04:33.249> of<00:04:33.969> picking<00:04:34.509> him<00:04:34.629> over

00:04:35.119 --> 00:04:35.129 
confident as of picking him over

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:38.760 
confident as of picking him over
Stevenson<00:04:36.129> as<00:04:36.279> a<00:04:36.309> would<00:04:36.550> cover<00:04:36.789> life<00:04:37.770> styles

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
Stevenson as a would cover life styles

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.950 
Stevenson as a would cover life styles
make<00:04:38.919> fights<00:04:38.979> but<00:04:39.490> at<00:04:40.240> this<00:04:40.360> point<00:04:40.599> in<00:04:40.749> time

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
make fights but at this point in time

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.719 
make fights but at this point in time
the<00:04:41.409> the<00:04:41.710> mistakes<00:04:42.099> he's<00:04:42.279> making<00:04:42.639> I<00:04:42.699> think

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
the the mistakes he's making I think

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:44.399 
the the mistakes he's making I think
would<00:04:42.999> be<00:04:43.120> more<00:04:43.300> easily<00:04:43.749> exploited<00:04:44.289> by

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:44.409 
would be more easily exploited by

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:46.799 
would be more easily exploited by
Stevenson<00:04:45.039> with<00:04:45.189> his<00:04:45.309> very<00:04:45.520> long<00:04:45.729> arms<00:04:46.150> the

00:04:46.799 --> 00:04:46.809
