your typical romance or it doesn't have

doesn't have your typical redeeming

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:31.700 
doesn't have your typical redeeming
factor<00:04:27.240> it<00:04:27.810> is<00:04:28.440> a<00:04:29.180> story<00:04:30.180> about<00:04:30.330> life<00:04:30.720> and

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
factor it is a story about life and

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.600 
factor it is a story about life and
that's<00:04:33.199> sometimes<00:04:34.199> really<00:04:34.770> rare<00:04:35.040> in<00:04:35.340> books

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
that's sometimes really rare in books

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.150 
that's sometimes really rare in books
and<00:04:36.000> I<00:04:36.479> refute<00:04:36.870> the<00:04:37.020> idea<00:04:37.050> that<00:04:37.410> this<00:04:37.710> story<00:04:38.010> of

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
and I refute the idea that this story of

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.850 
and I refute the idea that this story of
Esther<00:04:38.580> Earl<00:04:38.820> can't<00:04:39.330> live<00:04:39.570> on<00:04:39.810> and<00:04:40.229> can't<00:04:40.440> go

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
Esther Earl can't live on and can't go

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.590 
Esther Earl can't live on and can't go
on<00:04:41.100> and<00:04:41.370> can't<00:04:41.580> keep<00:04:41.790> growing<00:04:42.300> and<00:04:42.449> becoming

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
on and can't keep growing and becoming

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.890 
on and can't keep growing and becoming
so<00:04:43.320> few<00:04:43.680> first<00:04:43.979> impressions<00:04:44.639> of<00:04:44.880> this<00:04:45.030> book<00:04:45.360> I

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
so few first impressions of this book I

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.379 
so few first impressions of this book I
really<00:04:46.740> like<00:04:46.919> the<00:04:47.070> color<00:04:47.310> contrast<00:04:47.970> and<00:04:48.240> how

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:48.389 
really like the color contrast and how

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:51.320 
really like the color contrast and how
the<00:04:49.020> color<00:04:49.229> contrasts<00:04:50.070> were<00:04:50.310> chosen<00:04:50.910> because

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
the color contrasts were chosen because

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.590 
the color contrasts were chosen because
of<00:04:51.540> her<00:04:51.780> eye<00:04:52.020> shadow<00:04:52.380> within<00:04:53.280> these<00:04:53.970> pictures
