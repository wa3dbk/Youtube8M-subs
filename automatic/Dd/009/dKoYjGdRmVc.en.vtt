00:00:00.619 --> 00:00:05.930
 very good and yemen and metal analysis the atp 4 wanted to do the 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:12.129
 fourth installment of the mayor franchise is more profitable of the developer 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:18.190
 scenic in which many of us have left enough rooms 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:22.260
 when we were little boys and nothing uninhabited in the recreational of our 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.310
 art 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:30.720
 this time this player 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.300

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.030
 and now I'm going to reveal to you ladies and gentlemen 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.819
 one of the greatest privileges that has 

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:49.909
 be critical also video game analyst 

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:55.640
 which is to find out that the behind metal cans has incredible 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.870
 a story and a guiding thread because yes they have it because it turns out that for 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.840
 this fourth installment of the series 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.740
 it seems that the only thing that it offers is always more and more of the same 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:08.690
 Saturday 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.960
 we have to put an end to the threat of the amadeus organization 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:20.780
 the entertainment expand the computer virus 47 along if the width 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:27.370
 of the world network so our protagonists of the whole saga marked 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:28.200
 building 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.600
 plus two new acquisitions but nobody does anything tandil 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.750
 of head when stopping this new threat 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.299
 we're not going to cheat is an excuse like any other to 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.109
 inputs the square button of our pf control 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.410
 but equally valid and what we want is to free ourselves from our 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.410
 stress 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.600
 there is something new then in this the fourth one in 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.940
 deliver this acclaimed saga 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.290
 well for this new release apart from the two characters that 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.220
 established on the new cover 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.129
 nothing more than a handful of the three new 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:11.199
 we have 

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:14.649
 the metal fever meter 

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:16.359
 a meter that 

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:18.319
 although and feed we collect 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:23.499
 will fill up and begin to discount itself indicating that we have a time of 

00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:27.799
 invulnerability where we can get some special points 

00:02:30.029 --> 00:02:35.309
 in these points to give them a classification more power to check 

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:38.039
 when we finish the game 

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:42.069
 as is customary one of the things we know most until when 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:46.999
 will be die push the start button to continue 

00:02:48.279 --> 00:02:53.109
 so the illustrious too many they kill because that will bring this nickname 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:58.419
 to kill how many more serious is possible before they go with you 

00:02:59.259 --> 00:03:01.799
 and as always all this wrapped 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:06.850
 links to see if a very very very nice animations poured 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.309
 Strange enemies 

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:13.709
 and immense and incredible phase end bosses 

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:20.299
 so young any of us who at this moment is 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.740
 thinking that you will find yourself in this game 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.890
 more of the same from previous encounters 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.660
 that he knows that he is not mistaken because that is what this metal is the 4 we 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.030
 It offers an intact gameplay from its beginnings but that still works 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.009
 Like the first day 

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:45.989
 with everything as always this is our note and we say goodbye with her until the 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:46.669
 next game
