00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.469
 Hello everyone, just like you are good 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.599
 here I come back with another video about 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:16.570
 hairstyles in this case a hairstyle that 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:18.970
 right now practical I usually do it for 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:22.119
 the day to day many times because good 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.880
 as you see sisi then it melts a bit 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:27.340
 we are given a little more the tip is not going 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:31.509
 to notice much however the root remains 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:34.719
 smooth and good is very versatile is not 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:37.629
 made with iron that we analyze the root 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:39.280
 and we made the tip as always then 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:40.930
 how it is done 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.170
 and nothing I hope you like is very 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:47.019
 simple and I leave you as mir I have 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:50.019
 around here some tweezers to go grabbing 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:53.110
 the hair normally used a the brush 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:55.930
 that I always use and the plates I have 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:01:00.390
 already warm and nothing are going to start I'll 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.390
 to start by taking layers from bottom to top 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:08.899
 once the first layer has been selected 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:11.070
 I take a lock of hair and from the root 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:14.010
 let's make 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.990
 the iron always placed 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.340
 horizontally let's say horizontal 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.200
 with the floor that will be horizontal 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.620
 and when we see that it is reaching the 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.070
 tip 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.360
 We do like curls but we do not get to 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.670
 turn it around to do it in 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.200
 today I'm going to cut a little and 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.640
 when it's higher than it may look 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.729
 better and you will see the result 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.800
 although as you can see it is not very difficult 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:42.490
 we analyze from the root right and in 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.490
 horizontal 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.780
 good one thing that I did not say before that 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.810
 I forgot what he had to say 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.420
 principle of everything is that I said the 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.009
 iron in horizontal and we rotate we can 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.789
 turn inward as I am doing 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:02:00.069
 I was staying like this or we can turn 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:02.259
 outwards and the tips that point towards 

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:04.869
 outside or we could also combine them 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:07.479
 if we combine it I would advise to start 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.899
 with the tips making outward 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.730
 thus watching up when 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.280
 let's go down and then when we get to the 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.610
 half a mane when we have layers 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.799
 especially the top part of the hair 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.780
 the upper layers and we're going 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:24.370
 doing down is to say turning the 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.709
 griddle 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.090
 we analyze and turn down to 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.010
 principle we reviewed and others already up 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.129
 that would be a way to combine them and if 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:36.069
 we do not do everything the same in all the hair 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:39.909
 and there is another type of effect I am 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:41.910
 doing everything the same and everything in 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:43.710
 turning down to the iron 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.240
 look at this I think you are going to see a 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.240
 little better than before 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.080
 I put the grill on the root 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.480
 to the stew 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:03:00.810
 and when I have left 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.810
 a span more or less the hand shot 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.750
 Y 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.690
 it stays like this now it stays very 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.020
 perfect but then we will allocate it a 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.020
 little bit 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.940
 I'm almost finishing only 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.180
 I still have to touch up the fringe and this 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.180
 up here 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:18.980
 well and now we do the following I'm going to 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:22.480
 do like that with your fingers like claw type 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.480
 and I go 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.990
 to undo a little bit that is so 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.990
 well done 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.530
 we take here and we pull back 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.389
 because if we have done well in it 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.389
 everything has come to us but with the face 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.060
 and once so without fear 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.860
 ra and smooth 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.860
 the tips with shapes 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:11.150
 a little lacquer me mostly because if 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:13.420
 I do not have the bangs 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.420
 all right 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.780
 at a safe distance 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:39.060
 or 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:42.960
 and so our smooth roots and the 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:45.060
 molded tips with volume or as 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.289
 you want to call those with hair 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.539
 curly 

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:50.309
 analyze and the way they are going to give it 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:53.399
 easy to the tips because its shape already 

00:05:50.309 --> 00:05:54.869
 they have curly they have it smooth they have to 

00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:57.319
 make a lot of effort even 

00:05:54.869 --> 00:05:59.819
 before a little before what I said 

00:05:57.319 --> 00:06:02.819
 use it and do it a lot a lot a lot 

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:04.979
 curl so there is a corkscrew because 

00:06:02.819 --> 00:06:06.479
 if we open it then that's going to go 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:09.059
 undoing and good those that have the 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:11.129
 smooth hair will know it from experience 

00:06:09.059 --> 00:06:15.080
 I hope it's useful and we'll see you in the 

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:15.080
 next video kisses chau
