00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.200
 precisely the marriage of genres is 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.850
 exactly what dared catherine 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.090
 castellani for the renovation of this 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.290
 19th century mansion 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.210
 they were occupied by offices 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.009
 before becoming a real Eden 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.000
 Asian in the heart of the frenzy 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.770
 Parisian Catherine I am delighted with you 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.210
 meet you are architect dplg 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.560
 it was you who were in charge of 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.960
 restructure to completely rethink 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.430
 this particular hotel the problem we 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.930
 met was the change of 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.640
 offices destination homes 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.710
 first it weakens file which neighbors 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.320
 who refused the right of view the 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.899
 solution that I had was to create 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.640
 a space to turn on itself around 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.110
 from a patio there was no passion 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.290
 here and the canopies tonight where I 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.930
 broken part of the large canopy 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.399
 to create a patio of 2.6 by 6 which 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.870
 was the minimum to be able to have the 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.309
 right of habitation and make sure that 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.960
 this particular mathon hotel turns 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.399
 around the patio is the well of 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.989
 light it is he who feeds more or 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.210
 less there is the soul of the house is 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.879
 the living space in which there is a 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.180
 vegetable mineral the water of the candles the 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.600
 evening we allowed ourselves to go very 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.700
 far 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.590
 creating an oasis is a real mix of 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.570
 people what brought you from 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.240
 on this style removes lannic decoration 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.630
 situ of cultural of the couple who lives 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.210
 places 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.619
 this year sir and western and 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.850
 worked in metallurgy and 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.880
 madam and asians 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.259
 they have lifestyles to stories 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.850
 of their lives from their journey to 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.140
 their journey is expressed through 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.490
 the architectured all the wood panels 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.439
 what we see here is what essence 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.240
 already it's tech that of the text I 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.549
 went to Asia to look for 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.760
 artisans to do exactly at the 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.040
 custom request 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.870
 this type of cornices the big present 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.250
 to play 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.080
 all that was done by 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.040
 craftsmen have all been made by 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:46.140
 artisans including furniture fleeces 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.300
 in trellises and sliding doors 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.890
 that you see here are doors that 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.330
 have been adapted in this furniture or it's 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.580
 period or been custom made to 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.680
 tailor-made trade winds to separate space 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.570
 public of private space what does it say to 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.580
 soil is not that too it's tech 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.320
 old recover it comes from very 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.730
 old pikinoise houses actually 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.140
 is it interesting to do 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.330
 come elements like that from asia 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.130
 between the transport trip and all that 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.720
 so n is about 30% on a body 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.400
 medical especially fallen on big 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.690
 spaces stasis yeti with the 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.460
 library the doors that we have it 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.860
 found and then the metal for gentleman 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.810
 with the kitchen stainless steel is omnipresent 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.400
 and it's this metal counter is just a 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.010
 reminder individuals at the ball of thiais 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.340
 to have made a big glass cage and 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:29.690
 of metal and we will find here and there 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:33.220
 107 homes mechanical keys 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.220
 [Music] 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.489
 the higher tasks one after 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.970
 parental that overlooks a large 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.230
 veranda 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:44.670
 we will discover sailing 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:46.670
 [Music] 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.670
 1 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.410
 and there are some very decorative elements 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.750
 interesting serve his 4th dan this is in 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.180
 makes the entrance of a temple an Indian that 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.670
 the master of the house at 18 and soul by 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.680
 near eighteenth say middle 18th that the 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.060
 owner brought back from there it's 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.850
 very very pretty without which I have 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.370
 to precisely connect the partitions up to date 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:10.570
 and that make the effect of houses at and 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.250
 Chinese when one is at 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.750
 ground floor was all in height 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.180
 all in height with a lot of 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.040
 veiled verticality is where does that 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.810
 you put as material that's 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.340
 silver schist classified time of the 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.980
 ceramic shale and there plates 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.960
 similar schist with mittal appearance 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.670
 which again recalls the structure 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.680
 global metal of always doing 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.180
 pleasure to one and the horizon 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.770
 it's something that is very very 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.780
 bright is what there is every time 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.760
 despite all blinds shutters 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.010
 all the roofing has 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.880
 shutters and so space can be 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.460
 completely hidden 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.560
 if we throw aside a coin that is 

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:46.060
 an unsanitary run-run veranda where we 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.860
 installs not sleep what is it exactly 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.440
 it is especially the space of leisures for 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.510
 the family here with a jukebox of 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.890
 50s we are not sure of the tech 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.680
 as a lower floor the army in 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.150
 all rooms have bamboo flooring 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.110
 like imported from asia 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:00.850
 so you told me that there is no 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.980
 opening on the outside but this 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.630
 being it's very bright how is it 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.400
 that you shot but we did it 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.240
 bypassed by glazing 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.860
 translucent 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:11.140
 we really wanted to avoid the effect of 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:14.290
 therefore squeezes it is performing level 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.880
 self - cleaning thermal acoustic is 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.560
 what there is a user manual a recipe 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.870
 to rehabilitate private mansions 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.590
 in my opinion no it's my seventh hotel 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.530
 particular 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:26.050
 they are all different but decision 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:29.650
 architectural are often guided on 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.940
 the identity of future occupants and I 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.440
 is that this place all together at 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.650
 maximum and that's all to our good 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.479
 thank you thank you very much thank you thank you 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.340
 typically classical or of a kind 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:40.930
 rather ethnic mansions 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.000
 know how to respond to all 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.350
 architectural styles 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.699
 contrary to popular beliefs these 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.770
 mansions can therefore be 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:51.960
 transform into an incredible playground 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.960
 for ambitious and creative people
