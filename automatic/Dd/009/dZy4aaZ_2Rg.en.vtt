accurate<00:00:03.090> color<00:00:03.300> calibration<00:00:03.710> using<00:00:04.710> the

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
accurate color calibration using the

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.070 
accurate color calibration using the
spider<00:00:05.040> checker<00:00:05.400> capture<00:00:06.150> Pro<00:00:06.330> so<00:00:06.750> basically

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
and here's a shot of the target of the

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.590 
and here's a shot of the target of the
spider<00:00:23.369> checker<00:00:23.609> that<00:00:23.760> we<00:00:23.850> took<00:00:23.970> on<00:00:24.119> location

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
spider checker that we took on location

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.240 
spider checker that we took on location
so<00:00:24.810> let's<00:00:24.990> get<00:00:25.109> started<00:00:25.500> so<00:00:25.710> if<00:00:25.949> you<00:00:26.039> look<00:00:26.160> at

dots now the neutral color balance or
white<00:00:34.920> color<00:00:35.160> balance<00:00:35.610> square<00:00:36.540> is<00:00:36.719> right<00:00:36.930> here

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
white color balance square is right here

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.869 
white color balance square is right here
eetu<00:00:37.800> so<00:00:38.129> we're<00:00:38.250> going<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.399> use<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:38.700> in<00:00:38.820> a

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
eetu so we're going to use that in a

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.459 
eetu so we're going to use that in a
second<00:00:39.270> but<00:00:39.390> first<00:00:39.570> we're<00:00:39.809> going<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:39.989> crop<00:00:40.230> in

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
second but first we're going to crop in

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.680 
second but first we're going to crop in
to<00:00:41.280> those<00:00:41.399> white<00:00:41.700> dots<00:00:41.730> that<00:00:42.210> I<00:00:42.239> just<00:00:42.450> showed

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
to those white dots that I just showed

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.630 
to those white dots that I just showed
you<00:00:42.840> so<00:00:43.079> I'm<00:00:43.290> just<00:00:43.500> going<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:43.800> bring<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.430> crop

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
you so I'm just going to bring the crop

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.869 
you so I'm just going to bring the crop
tool<00:00:44.940> down<00:00:45.270> I'll<00:00:46.020> bring<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.379> up<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:47.039> then<00:00:47.100> I

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
tool down I'll bring it up and then I

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.790 
tool down I'll bring it up and then I
can<00:00:47.940> shift<00:00:48.270> this<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:48.840> can<00:00:49.020> also<00:00:49.230> just<00:00:49.469> come

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
can shift this and I can also just come

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.350 
can shift this and I can also just come
to<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:49.980> corner<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:50.670> can<00:00:50.820> level<00:00:51.210> that

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
to the corner and I can level that

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.790 
to the corner and I can level that
because<00:00:51.539> you<00:00:51.600> can<00:00:51.719> see<00:00:51.899> that<00:00:52.110> wasn't<00:00:52.469> level

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
because you can see that wasn't level

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.580 
because you can see that wasn't level
and<00:00:53.149> we're<00:00:54.149> not<00:00:54.270> quite<00:00:54.629> centered<00:00:55.020> I'll<00:00:55.469> just

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
and we're not quite centered I'll just

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.490 
and we're not quite centered I'll just
bring<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:56.039> little<00:00:56.070> more<00:00:57.289> shift<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.440> over

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
bring it a little more shift that over

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.430 
bring it a little more shift that over
and<00:00:59.250> it's<00:00:59.820> looking<00:01:00.210> pretty<00:01:00.570> good<00:01:00.809> it's<00:01:01.320> still

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
and it's looking pretty good it's still

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.619 
and it's looking pretty good it's still
just<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.890> little<00:01:01.920> bit<00:01:02.670> crooked<00:01:03.090> there<00:01:03.359> let's

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
just a little bit crooked there let's

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:04.670 
just a little bit crooked there let's
just<00:01:03.690> straighten<00:01:04.080> that

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
just straighten that

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.890 
just straighten that
and<00:01:04.769> so<00:01:05.549> we've<00:01:05.729> cropped<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.210> in<00:01:06.330> pretty<00:01:06.630> good<00:01:06.840> I

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
and so we've cropped it in pretty good I

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.830 
and so we've cropped it in pretty good I
think<00:01:07.140> I'll<00:01:07.260> bring<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:07.439> up<00:01:07.590> just<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.460> touch

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840

neutralize<00:01:28.530> our<00:01:28.560> white<00:01:28.890> balance<00:01:29.280> now<00:01:29.729> if<00:01:29.880> you

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
neutralize our white balance now if you

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.490 
neutralize our white balance now if you
look<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.299> upper<00:01:30.570> right<00:01:30.780> before<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.140> do<00:01:31.229> that

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
look to the upper right before I do that

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.020 
look to the upper right before I do that
look<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.950> upper<00:01:32.250> right<00:01:32.579> below<00:01:32.880> the

look to the upper right below the

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.880 
look to the upper right below the
histogram<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:33.960> can<00:01:33.990> see<00:01:34.259> that<00:01:34.409> it's<00:01:34.530> ninety

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
histogram you can see that it's ninety

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.880 
histogram you can see that it's ninety
two<00:01:35.640> point<00:01:35.880> two<00:01:36.150> for<00:01:36.360> red<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:37.110> green<00:01:37.590> see

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.639 
balance now the next step I want to do
is<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.509> want<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.780> check<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.020> see<00:01:46.320> what<00:01:46.439> this<00:01:46.590> is

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
is I want to check to see what this is

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.609 
is I want to check to see what this is
now<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:48.060> white<00:01:48.299> square<00:01:48.630> here<00:01:48.960> at<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.350> top

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
now the white square here at the top

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.780 
now the white square here at the top
that's<00:01:50.899> 96.7<00:01:51.899> we<00:01:52.470> want<00:01:52.649> this<00:01:52.770> more<00:01:53.070> around<00:01:53.399> 90%

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
that's 96.7 we want this more around 90%

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.389 
that's 96.7 we want this more around 90%
and<00:01:54.390> this<00:01:54.630> bottom<00:01:54.960> black<00:01:55.649> square<00:01:56.009> we<00:01:56.219> want

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
and this bottom black square we want

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.969 
and this bottom black square we want
this<00:01:56.520> around<00:01:56.729> 4%<00:01:57.240> so<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.079> adjust<00:01:58.500> this<00:01:58.710> white

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
this around 4% so to adjust this white

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.039 
this around 4% so to adjust this white
square<00:01:59.250> I'm<00:01:59.430> going<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.670> use<00:01:59.880> my<00:02:00.090> exposure<00:02:00.479> I'm

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
square I'm going to use my exposure I'm

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.109 
square I'm going to use my exposure I'm
going<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.259> drop<00:02:01.380> it<00:02:01.530> down<00:02:01.560> about<00:02:01.979> one<00:02:02.759> full

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
going to drop it down about one full

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.240 
going to drop it down about one full
stop<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.960> that<00:02:04.049> should<00:02:04.259> get<00:02:04.380> as<00:02:04.500> close<00:02:04.860> to<00:02:05.130> the

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
stop and that should get as close to the

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.889 
stop and that should get as close to the
range<00:02:05.460> there<00:02:05.820> so<00:02:06.329> I'm<00:02:06.420> going<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:06.570> come<00:02:06.689> over<00:02:06.750> to

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
range there so I'm going to come over to

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.330 
range there so I'm going to come over to
check<00:02:07.079> it<00:02:07.200> again<00:02:07.469> and

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
check it again and

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.609 
check it again and
yep<00:02:08.880> we're<00:02:09.119> pretty<00:02:09.450> close<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:09.750> 90%<00:02:10.200> right

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
yep we're pretty close to 90% right

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.870 
yep we're pretty close to 90% right
there<00:02:10.830> so<00:02:11.039> let's<00:02:11.220> just<00:02:11.400> check<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.700> black

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
there so let's just check the black

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.330 
there so let's just check the black
square<00:02:12.150> we're<00:02:12.390> at<00:02:12.480> about<00:02:12.660> 19<00:02:13.110> so<00:02:13.800> I<00:02:13.830> can<00:02:14.220> bring

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
square we're at about 19 so I can bring

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.190 
square we're at about 19 so I can bring
my<00:02:14.489> shadows<00:02:14.970> down<00:02:15.270> I<00:02:15.599> can<00:02:15.720> bring<00:02:15.840> that<00:02:15.959> down<00:02:16.020> to

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
my shadows down I can bring that down to

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.170 
my shadows down I can bring that down to
about<00:02:16.470> there<00:02:16.830> and<00:02:17.400> I<00:02:17.459> can<00:02:17.610> bring<00:02:17.730> my<00:02:17.910> blacks

about there and I can bring my blacks

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.210 
about there and I can bring my blacks
down<00:02:18.480> around<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:19.170> same<00:02:19.440> amount<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:20.099> we'll

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
down around the same amount and we'll

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.240 
down around the same amount and we'll
see<00:02:20.400> what<00:02:20.520> we<00:02:20.640> got<00:02:20.819> now<00:02:21.810> look<00:02:21.930> at<00:02:22.020> that<00:02:22.050> 3.8<00:02:22.739> Wow

see what we got now look at that 3.8 Wow

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.589 
see what we got now look at that 3.8 Wow
that's<00:02:23.550> pretty<00:02:23.760> good<00:02:23.910> I'm<00:02:24.150> going<00:02:24.270> to<00:02:24.330> double

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
that's pretty good I'm going to double

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.780 
that's pretty good I'm going to double
check<00:02:24.630> here<00:02:24.780> eighty<00:02:25.739> nine<00:02:25.950> point<00:02:26.220> two<00:02:26.340> that's

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
check here eighty nine point two that's

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.220 
check here eighty nine point two that's
pretty<00:02:27.060> close<00:02:27.300> I'm<00:02:27.569> going<00:02:27.750> to<00:02:27.810> leave<00:02:27.989> it<00:02:28.110> like

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
pretty close I'm going to leave it like

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.920 
pretty close I'm going to leave it like
that<00:02:28.280> next<00:02:29.280> step<00:02:29.459> is<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:29.970> export<00:02:30.360> this<00:02:30.569> image

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
that next step is to export this image

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.839 
that next step is to export this image
as<00:02:31.110> a<00:02:31.170> tiff<00:02:31.709> and<00:02:32.010> then<00:02:32.430> we're<00:02:32.519> going<00:02:32.610> to<00:02:32.670> bring

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
as a tiff and then we're going to bring

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.150 
as a tiff and then we're going to bring
it<00:02:33.000> into<00:02:33.120> the<00:02:33.330> software<00:02:33.870> to<00:02:34.170> create<00:02:34.709> a<00:02:34.739> custom

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
the only thing about this is the white

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.030 
the only thing about this is the white
balance<00:04:38.610> is<00:04:38.940> off<00:04:39.210> as<00:04:39.990> well<00:04:40.320> so<00:04:40.620> we<00:04:40.830> want<00:04:40.980> to

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
balance is off as well so we want to

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.170 
balance is off as well so we want to
come<00:04:41.160> back<00:04:41.190> here<00:04:41.520> we<00:04:41.640> want<00:04:41.790> to<00:04:41.850> check<00:04:42.030> our

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
come back here we want to check our

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.490 
come back here we want to check our
white<00:04:42.420> balance<00:04:42.840> I'm<00:04:43.020> going<00:04:43.170> to<00:04:43.260> apply<00:04:43.440> this

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
white balance I'm going to apply this

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.650 
white balance I'm going to apply this
preset<00:04:44.130> just<00:04:44.340> to<00:04:44.880> make<00:04:45.000> sure<00:04:45.030> we<00:04:45.270> have<00:04:45.390> all<00:04:45.420> our

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
preset just to make sure we have all our

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.330 
preset just to make sure we have all our
colors<00:04:45.870> and<00:04:46.170> then<00:04:46.740> I'm<00:04:46.860> going<00:04:46.950> to<00:04:47.010> click<00:04:47.220> the

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
colors and then I'm going to click the

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:48.770 
colors and then I'm going to click the
white<00:04:47.490> balance<00:04:47.790> tool<00:04:48.000> and<00:04:48.540> we're<00:04:48.630> going<00:04:48.660> to

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
white balance tool and we're going to

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.450 
white balance tool and we're going to
set<00:04:48.930> our<00:04:49.050> neutral<00:04:49.350> white<00:04:49.530> balance<00:04:49.920> so<00:04:50.310> that's

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
set our neutral white balance so that's

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.420 
set our neutral white balance so that's
saying<00:04:50.640> 70<00:04:51.150> 450<00:04:51.660> minus<00:04:52.020> 5<00:04:52.320> so<00:04:53.130> we've<00:04:53.250> already

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
saying 70 450 minus 5 so we've already

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.400 
saying 70 450 minus 5 so we've already
applied<00:04:53.760> the<00:04:54.000> preset<00:04:54.540> we<00:04:54.930> just<00:04:55.140> have<00:04:55.290> to

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
applied the preset we just have to

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:58.010 
applied the preset we just have to
adjust<00:04:55.500> the<00:04:56.130> white<00:04:56.400> balance<00:04:56.690> so<00:04:57.690> we'll<00:04:57.900> bring

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
adjust the white balance so we'll bring

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.760 
adjust the white balance so we'll bring
it<00:04:58.170> up<00:04:58.260> to<00:04:58.500> about<00:04:58.530> 74<00:05:00.380> let's<00:05:01.380> say<00:05:01.560> that's

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
it up to about 74 let's say that's

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.300 
it up to about 74 let's say that's
pretty<00:05:02.670> close<00:05:03.030> and<00:05:03.360> then<00:05:04.020> minus<00:05:04.710> 5

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
pretty close and then minus 5

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.740 
pretty close and then minus 5
now<00:05:05.370> you<00:05:05.430> could<00:05:05.640> tweak<00:05:05.880> this<00:05:06.060> to<00:05:06.120> taste<00:05:06.510> if<00:05:06.720> you

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
now you could tweak this to taste if you

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:07.940 
now you could tweak this to taste if you
want<00:05:06.870> but<00:05:07.290> that<00:05:07.380> should<00:05:07.560> get<00:05:07.650> us<00:05:07.710> in<00:05:07.890> the

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:07.950 
want but that should get us in the

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:10.070 
want but that should get us in the
ballpark<00:05:08.090> so<00:05:09.090> you<00:05:09.150> could<00:05:09.300> see<00:05:09.480> if<00:05:09.660> we<00:05:09.690> compare

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
ballpark so you could see if we compare

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.410 
ballpark so you could see if we compare
that<00:05:10.110> image<00:05:10.440> to<00:05:10.770> this<00:05:10.950> image<00:05:11.310> we<00:05:12.030> have<00:05:12.180> much

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:12.420 
that image to this image we have much

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.840 
that image to this image we have much
improved<00:05:12.870> color<00:05:13.170> and<00:05:13.440> you<00:05:14.010> can<00:05:14.130> see<00:05:14.340> here<00:05:14.640> -

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
improved color and you can see here -

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.600 
improved color and you can see here -
like<00:05:15.090> I<00:05:15.210> mentioned<00:05:15.630> the<00:05:15.750> HSL<00:05:16.410> grayscale<00:05:16.920> well

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 
like I mentioned the HSL grayscale well

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.190 
like I mentioned the HSL grayscale well
you<00:05:17.700> could<00:05:17.850> see<00:05:18.030> all<00:05:18.240> the<00:05:18.540> adjustments<00:05:19.050> that's

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:19.200 
you could see all the adjustments that's

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.490 
you could see all the adjustments that's
made<00:05:19.470> to<00:05:19.770> hue<00:05:20.430> saturation<00:05:20.910> and<00:05:21.630> luminance<00:05:21.900> for

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
made to hue saturation and luminance for

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.040 
made to hue saturation and luminance for
each<00:05:22.680> color<00:05:23.010> but<00:05:23.640> if<00:05:23.700> you<00:05:23.760> look<00:05:23.880> over<00:05:23.970> here<00:05:24.510> you

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.050 
each color but if you look over here you

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.470 
each color but if you look over here you
can<00:05:25.200> see<00:05:25.320> these<00:05:25.470> are<00:05:25.650> all<00:05:25.680> 0<00:05:26.250> so<00:05:27.090> what<00:05:27.240> I<00:05:27.270> could

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:27.480 
can see these are all 0 so what I could

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.790 
can see these are all 0 so what I could
do<00:05:27.660> is<00:05:27.930> just<00:05:28.380> apply<00:05:28.530> that<00:05:28.890> preset<00:05:29.570> spider<00:05:30.800> and

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
do is just apply that preset spider and

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.350 
do is just apply that preset spider and
you<00:05:32.010> see<00:05:32.160> everything<00:05:32.400> jumped<00:05:32.730> so<00:05:32.910> it<00:05:33.000> adjusts

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
you see everything jumped so it adjusts

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.300 
you see everything jumped so it adjusts
your<00:05:33.420> colors<00:05:33.840> and<00:05:34.050> then<00:05:34.410> all<00:05:34.590> we<00:05:34.860> have<00:05:34.890> to<00:05:35.040> do

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
your colors and then all we have to do

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.940 
your colors and then all we have to do
is<00:05:35.550> adjust<00:05:35.820> the<00:05:36.630> white<00:05:36.840> balance<00:05:36.870> so<00:05:37.740> the

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:37.950 
is adjust the white balance so the

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:40.340 
is adjust the white balance so the
Kelvin<00:05:38.340> and<00:05:38.550> the<00:05:38.760> tint<00:05:39.030> so<00:05:39.900> we'll<00:05:40.050> just<00:05:40.170> adjust

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.350 
Kelvin and the tint so we'll just adjust

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:42.860 
Kelvin and the tint so we'll just adjust
that<00:05:40.800> and<00:05:41.130> you<00:05:41.760> can<00:05:41.880> always<00:05:42.090> play<00:05:42.330> with<00:05:42.510> this<00:05:42.690> I

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
that and you can always play with this I

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.900 
that and you can always play with this I
mean<00:05:43.020> this<00:05:43.110> is<00:05:43.260> just<00:05:43.290> a<00:05:43.560> good<00:05:43.710> place<00:05:44.070> to<00:05:44.790> get

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:44.910 
mean this is just a good place to get

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.090 
mean this is just a good place to get
started<00:05:45.180> in<00:05:45.510> my<00:05:45.660> opinion<00:05:46.110> you<00:05:46.620> can<00:05:46.650> kind<00:05:47.010> of

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.100 
started in my opinion you can kind of

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.370 
started in my opinion you can kind of
adjust<00:05:47.730> it<00:05:47.880> any<00:05:48.060> way<00:05:48.210> you<00:05:48.240> want<00:05:48.570> to<00:05:48.870> your

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 
adjust it any way you want to your

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.590 
adjust it any way you want to your
personal<00:05:49.800> preference<00:05:50.190> but<00:05:50.400> I<00:05:50.940> think<00:05:51.360> it's

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 
personal preference but I think it's

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.230 
personal preference but I think it's
always<00:05:51.840> good<00:05:52.170> to<00:05:52.200> start<00:05:52.410> with<00:05:53.010> a<00:05:53.850> neutral

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 
always good to start with a neutral

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.350 
always good to start with a neutral
light<00:05:54.420> balance<00:05:54.630> and<00:05:55.080> adjust<00:05:55.890> your<00:05:56.160> colors<00:05:57.120> and

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 
light balance and adjust your colors and

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.970 
light balance and adjust your colors and
then<00:05:57.870> if<00:05:58.080> you<00:05:58.200> want<00:05:58.380> to<00:05:58.440> make<00:05:58.560> some<00:05:58.680> creative

00:05:58.970 --> 00:05:58.980 
then if you want to make some creative

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:00.260 
then if you want to make some creative
choices<00:05:59.160> from<00:05:59.400> there<00:05:59.580> that's<00:05:59.760> up<00:05:59.910> to<00:06:00.000> you

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.270 
choices from there that's up to you

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.080 
choices from there that's up to you
so<00:06:00.660> that's<00:06:00.840> how<00:06:00.960> you<00:06:01.020> do<00:06:01.230> that<00:06:01.440> in<00:06:01.910> Lightroom<00:06:02.910> I

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.090 
so that's how you do that in Lightroom I

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:04.910 
so that's how you do that in Lightroom I
think<00:06:03.480> what<00:06:03.570> I'll<00:06:03.660> do<00:06:03.810> is<00:06:04.050> do<00:06:04.230> a<00:06:04.260> part<00:06:04.590> two<00:06:04.890> of

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:04.920 
think what I'll do is do a part two of

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.890 
think what I'll do is do a part two of
this<00:06:05.280> for<00:06:05.640> people<00:06:05.850> who<00:06:06.000> use<00:06:06.210> Adobe<00:06:06.600> Camera<00:06:06.750> Raw

this for people who use Adobe Camera Raw

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.690 
this for people who use Adobe Camera Raw
