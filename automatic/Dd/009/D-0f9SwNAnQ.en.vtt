00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.360 
you how to make the Thunderbolt cs6 this
is<00:00:06.000> a<00:00:06.029> plum<00:00:06.299> that<00:00:06.480> I<00:00:06.540> designed<00:00:06.870> by<00:00:07.049> myself<00:00:07.470> it

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
is a plum that I designed by myself it

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.419 
is a plum that I designed by myself it
flies<00:00:08.580> very<00:00:08.880> well<00:00:09.150> and<00:00:09.300> it<00:00:09.389> flies<00:00:09.570> very<00:00:09.840> fast

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:10.429 
flies very well and it flies very fast

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:13.759 
flies very well and it flies very fast
make<00:00:11.429> this<00:00:11.639> plane<00:00:11.940> you<00:00:12.300> will<00:00:12.450> need<00:00:12.630> 1<00:00:13.469> square

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
make this plane you will need 1 square

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.930 
make this plane you will need 1 square
sheet<00:00:14.040> of<00:00:14.070> paper<00:00:16.279> now<00:00:17.279> let's<00:00:17.609> start<00:00:17.820> making

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
sheet of paper now let's start making

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.970 
sheet of paper now let's start making
the<00:00:18.210> plane<00:00:18.560> first<00:00:19.560> fold<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.490> paper<00:00:20.670> in<00:00:20.820> half

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:24.980 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.429 

next<00:00:26.150> unfold<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.390> fold<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.869> corners<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.410> the

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
next unfold and fold the corners to the

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:44.940 
next unfold and fold the corners to the
middle<00:00:35.899> now<00:00:36.899> fold<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.200> edge<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.710> middle

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:44.950 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.830 

now<00:00:45.670> fold<00:00:45.970> it<00:00:46.090> in<00:00:46.180> half<00:00:48.240> now<00:00:49.240> the<00:00:49.300> back<00:00:49.600> should

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:49.840 
now fold it in half now the back should

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.450 
now fold it in half now the back should
be<00:00:49.870> white<00:00:50.170> and<00:00:50.380> most<00:00:50.770> of<00:00:50.920> the<00:00:50.980> body<00:00:51.160> should<00:00:51.430> be

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
be white and most of the body should be

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:58.819 
be white and most of the body should be
yellow<00:00:51.760> now<00:00:52.510> make<00:00:52.720> your<00:00:52.870> wings

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.470 

make<00:00:59.460> sure<00:00:59.489> that<00:00:59.640> you<00:00:59.879> wings<00:01:00.059> are<00:01:00.239> touching

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
make sure that you wings are touching

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.790 
make sure that you wings are touching
the<00:01:00.570> bottom<00:01:00.719> of<00:01:00.899> your<00:01:00.929> plane<00:01:01.320> because<00:01:01.679> it

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
the bottom of your plane because it

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.470 
the bottom of your plane because it
helps<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.219> fly<00:01:02.399> better<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.059> makes<00:01:03.089> it<00:01:03.359> go

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
helps it fly better and it makes it go

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.980 
helps it fly better and it makes it go
faster<00:01:04.430> now<00:01:05.430> unfold<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.390> wings<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.659> little<00:01:06.689> bit

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
faster now unfold the wings a little bit

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.070 
faster now unfold the wings a little bit
and<00:01:07.170> now<00:01:07.979> it<00:01:08.130> should<00:01:08.280> look<00:01:08.369> like<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:09.020> now<00:01:10.020> if

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
and now it should look like this now if

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.830 
and now it should look like this now if
you<00:01:10.259> built<00:01:10.500> your<00:01:10.680> Thunderbolt<00:01:11.250> cs6<00:01:11.909> let's<00:01:12.630> do

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
you built your Thunderbolt cs6 let's do

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:54.810 
you built your Thunderbolt cs6 let's do
some<00:01:13.049> test<00:01:13.229> flights

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:08.040 

one<00:01:55.820> more<00:01:56.030> test<00:01:56.210> flight

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.369 

hope<00:02:09.050> you<00:02:09.170> like<00:02:09.319> my<00:02:09.500> video<00:02:09.649> by
