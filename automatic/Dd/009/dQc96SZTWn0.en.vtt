00:00:00.939 --> 00:00:05.060
 while brainy insurance analysts of the economy are racking the 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.019
 brains to find out the magical recipes that take us out of the crisis with 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:12.849
 the reflation of banks thanks to the injections of state funds 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:17.460
 In all countries it is possible that the solution is within our reach 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.420
 but that the lack of vision of those who govern us are not capable of 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.689
 develop bright ideas 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.970
 Spain is going through a critical moment with more than one million unemployed 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.050
 The lists of the inem a high inflation and a gross domestic product swell 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.830
 compromised in part with banking entities 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:38.030
 an exit graceful to overcome the bump is the creation of a monetary system 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.860
 Intercontinental between Spain and Latin America 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.470
 not only cultural ties unite us but the same root of the language that eliminates 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:47.790
 any barrier 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.320
 the tariff structures that protect the fragile economies of 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.470
 the Latin countries or against the American giant should be annulled in the 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.830
 bilateral relations with Spain 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.340
 to create a market with common interests and objectives parallel to the union 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:07.450
 in Europe that establish strong economic links and that allow the 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.790
 latin market open to europe 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.630
 It would even be good to consider the creation of a currency as a nexus of 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.870
 union between the economic relations of our country and Latin America 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.610
 Spain has become a recipient of a growing wave of immigrants 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.160
 Latin American and is currently estimated to welcome approached two million 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.220
 people from latin america 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.010
 The five main collectives of Latin Americans in Spain are 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.690
 formed by Ecuadorian Bolivian and Peruvian Colombian Colombians 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.510
 people who are required too much paperwork to stay in 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:42.550
 our country 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.420
 thanks to these new or citizens the Spanish population growth 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.000
 record positive figures 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.840
 in immigration policies, the efforts would be aimed at 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.370
 eliminate excessive bureaucracy for the care of the residence and the 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.160
 family reunification 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.260
 It is clear that the policies of the voluntary return plan have been a 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.280
 failure 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.860
 We can not close the doors of Latin America if Spain collaborates with these 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.590
 countries in a common front would be a way to overcome the crisis
