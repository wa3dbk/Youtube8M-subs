00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
a charger that hurts a USB thumb

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.570 
a charger that hurts a USB thumb
connector<00:03:56.030> adapter<00:03:56.120> cable<00:03:57.099> yeah<00:03:58.099> it<00:03:58.280> has<00:03:58.430> the

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
connector adapter cable yeah it has the

phones<00:04:00.409> and<00:04:00.950> stuff<00:04:01.360> okay<00:04:02.360> so<00:04:02.420> i<00:04:02.599> think<00:04:02.780> this<00:04:03.079> is

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319 
phones and stuff okay so i think this is

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:06.580 
phones and stuff okay so i think this is
the<00:04:03.530> actual<00:04:03.709> manual<00:04:05.019> got<00:04:06.019> all<00:04:06.290> this<00:04:06.440> stuff

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
the actual manual got all this stuff

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.119 
the actual manual got all this stuff
looks<00:04:06.980> like<00:04:07.159> exactly<00:04:07.819> the<00:04:07.909> same<00:04:08.329> as<00:04:09.129> the

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:10.129 
looks like exactly the same as the

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:21.000 
looks like exactly the same as the
bigger<00:04:10.670> one<00:04:11.920> here's<00:04:12.920> the<00:04:13.040> power<00:04:13.430> adapter

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:27.240 

comes<00:04:22.010> with<00:04:22.460> those<00:04:22.880> to<00:04:23.300> actually<00:04:23.690> plug<00:04:24.050> it

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.740 

this<00:04:28.250> is<00:04:28.460> they<00:04:28.610> actually<00:04:28.729> plug<00:04:29.240> it<00:04:29.389> into<00:04:29.510> the

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
this is they actually plug it into the

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.969 
this is they actually plug it into the
wall<00:04:29.979> and<00:04:30.979> I<00:04:31.100> think<00:04:31.400> it's<00:04:31.550> because<00:04:32.770> this<00:04:33.770> is

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:33.979 
wall and I think it's because this is

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:35.710 
wall and I think it's because this is
for<00:04:34.220> different<00:04:34.669> countries<00:04:35.479> there's

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
for different countries there's

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.300 
for different countries there's
something<00:04:36.020> like<00:04:36.169> that<00:04:36.440> you<00:04:36.770> can<00:04:36.949> add<00:04:37.130> on

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
something like that you can add on

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.980 
something like that you can add on
different<00:04:37.699> adapters<00:04:38.210> to<00:04:38.240> plug<00:04:38.600> into<00:04:38.780> the<00:04:38.900> wall

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
different adapters to plug into the wall

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.990 
different adapters to plug into the wall
and<00:04:41.110> hopefully<00:04:42.220> because<00:04:43.220> I<00:04:43.370> still<00:04:43.610> have<00:04:43.820> my

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
and hopefully because I still have my

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.909 
and hopefully because I still have my
old<00:04:44.620> acer<00:04:45.620> a500<00:04:46.310> iconia<00:04:46.850> a<00:04:47.470> charger<00:04:48.470> hopefully

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:48.919 
old acer a500 iconia a charger hopefully

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:51.430 
old acer a500 iconia a charger hopefully
this<00:04:49.160> one<00:04:49.370> is<00:04:50.000> universal<00:04:50.780> and<00:04:50.840> works<00:04:51.110> then
