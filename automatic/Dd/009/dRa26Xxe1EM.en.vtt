welcome back i'm ray ortega today i want
to<00:00:02.550> show<00:00:02.790> you<00:00:03.049> two<00:00:04.049> methods<00:00:04.560> for<00:00:04.680> setting<00:00:05.190> up

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
to show you two methods for setting up

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.960 
to show you two methods for setting up
really<00:00:06.180> any<00:00:06.390> mixer<00:00:06.930> to<00:00:07.470> get<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:07.770> best<00:00:07.980> audio

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
really any mixer to get the best audio

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.180 
really any mixer to get the best audio
quality<00:00:09.269> out<00:00:09.660> of<00:00:09.809> it<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:10.080> lowest<00:00:10.410> noise<00:00:10.740> and

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
quality out of it the lowest noise and

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.360 
quality out of it the lowest noise and
to<00:00:11.639> properly<00:00:12.059> set<00:00:12.330> up<00:00:12.360> your<00:00:12.750> microphones<00:00:13.469> for

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
to properly set up your microphones for

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.019 
to properly set up your microphones for
getting<00:00:14.910> in<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.960> right<00:00:16.199> amount<00:00:16.560> of<00:00:16.770> game<00:00:17.730> or

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
getting in the right amount of game or

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.850 
getting in the right amount of game or
gain<00:00:18.300> staging<00:00:18.779> a<00:00:18.960> mixer

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:23.860 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.630 

now<00:00:24.789> I'm<00:00:24.850> using<00:00:25.030> a<00:00:25.210> behringer<00:00:25.720> xenyx<00:00:26.490> q80<00:00:27.490> to

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
now I'm using a behringer xenyx q80 to

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.230 
now I'm using a behringer xenyx q80 to
us<00:00:28.210> beef<00:00:28.450> is<00:00:28.660> a<00:00:28.840> cheap<00:00:29.170> sub<00:00:29.920> $100<00:00:30.580> mixer<00:00:31.060> and

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:31.240 
us beef is a cheap sub $100 mixer and

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.210 
us beef is a cheap sub $100 mixer and
this<00:00:31.810> is<00:00:31.960> a<00:00:31.990> great<00:00:32.349> one<00:00:32.529> to<00:00:32.590> show<00:00:32.890> you<00:00:32.920> on

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:33.220 
this is a great one to show you on

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.760 
this is a great one to show you on
because<00:00:33.700> it'll<00:00:34.150> act<00:00:34.420> like<00:00:34.660> most<00:00:35.020> mixers<00:00:35.500> in

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
because it'll act like most mixers in

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.390 
because it'll act like most mixers in
that<00:00:36.400> it<00:00:36.550> doesn't<00:00:36.850> have<00:00:37.030> a<00:00:37.410> pre<00:00:38.410> fader<00:00:38.739> listen

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:39.400 
that it doesn't have a pre fader listen

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.700 
that it doesn't have a pre fader listen
or<00:00:39.550> PFL<00:00:40.120> switch<00:00:40.420> which<00:00:40.870> makes<00:00:41.110> it<00:00:41.260> easier<00:00:41.590> to

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
or PFL switch which makes it easier to

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.090 
or PFL switch which makes it easier to
set<00:00:41.890> up<00:00:41.980> each<00:00:42.129> channel<00:00:42.670> but<00:00:43.449> most<00:00:44.290> mixers<00:00:44.769> all

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
set up each channel but most mixers all

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.619 
set up each channel but most mixers all
mixers<00:00:45.400> that<00:00:45.430> I've<00:00:45.610> come<00:00:46.000> in<00:00:46.120> contact<00:00:46.330> with

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:46.629 
mixers that I've come in contact with

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.549 
mixers that I've come in contact with
again<00:00:47.620> these<00:00:47.769> are<00:00:47.920> my<00:00:48.160> methods<00:00:49.110> most<00:00:50.110> mixers

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
again these are my methods most mixers

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:52.920 
again these are my methods most mixers
have<00:00:50.590> at<00:00:51.190> least<00:00:51.400> a<00:00:51.730> clip<00:00:52.150> light<00:00:52.390> on<00:00:52.600> the

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
have at least a clip light on the

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:55.259 
have at least a clip light on the
microphone<00:00:53.410> channels<00:00:53.890> and<00:00:54.100> as<00:00:54.730> well<00:00:54.970> you<00:00:55.000> have

00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:55.269 
microphone channels and as well you have

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:58.140 
microphone channels and as well you have
the<00:00:55.720> meters<00:00:56.290> from<00:00:56.920> the<00:00:57.070> main<00:00:57.220> mix<00:00:57.489> on<00:00:57.729> the<00:00:57.909> side

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.150 
the meters from the main mix on the side

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.850 
the meters from the main mix on the side
and<00:00:58.330> we're<00:00:58.449> going<00:00:58.540> to<00:00:58.629> use<00:00:58.750> those<00:00:59.049> two<00:00:59.379> methods

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
and we're going to use those two methods

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.460 
and we're going to use those two methods
to<00:01:00.070> set<00:01:00.790> up<00:01:00.940> really<00:01:01.390> hopefully<00:01:01.870> any<00:01:02.110> mixer

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:02.470 
to set up really hopefully any mixer

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.649 
to set up really hopefully any mixer
that<00:01:02.589> you<00:01:02.710> come<00:01:02.920> in<00:01:03.070> contact<00:01:03.280> with<00:01:03.729> to<00:01:04.089> get<00:01:04.479> the

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 
that you come in contact with to get the

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:07.440 
that you come in contact with to get the
best<00:01:05.010> gain<00:01:06.010> the<00:01:06.430> best<00:01:06.610> sound<00:01:06.970> out<00:01:07.240> of<00:01:07.270> the

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
best gain the best sound out of the

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.750 
best gain the best sound out of the
mixer<00:01:07.780> so<00:01:08.530> we've<00:01:08.650> got<00:01:08.830> everything<00:01:09.100> turned

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
mixer so we've got everything turned

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.960 
mixer so we've got everything turned
down<00:01:10.140> okay<00:01:11.140> and<00:01:11.440> we<00:01:11.710> start<00:01:11.979> at<00:01:12.159> the<00:01:12.340> top<00:01:12.580> this

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
down okay and we start at the top this

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.490 
down okay and we start at the top this
is<00:01:13.030> the<00:01:13.180> most<00:01:13.360> important<00:01:13.869> we<00:01:13.960> get<00:01:14.110> the<00:01:14.229> gain

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
is the most important we get the gain

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.410 
is the most important we get the gain
it's<00:01:15.070> called<00:01:15.250> gain<00:01:15.460> staging<00:01:15.970> and<00:01:16.119> this<00:01:16.240> is

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
it's called gain staging and this is

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.109 
it's called gain staging and this is
your<00:01:16.750> gain<00:01:17.320> knob<00:01:17.860> sometimes<00:01:18.670> referred<00:01:18.970> to<00:01:19.000> as

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
your gain knob sometimes referred to as

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:22.140 
your gain knob sometimes referred to as
trim<00:01:19.540> and<00:01:19.770> what<00:01:20.770> we're<00:01:20.920> going<00:01:21.130> to<00:01:21.190> do<00:01:21.430> with<00:01:21.909> all

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
trim and what we're going to do with all

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.170 
trim and what we're going to do with all
the<00:01:22.450> other<00:01:22.479> knobs<00:01:22.960> turn<00:01:23.560> down<00:01:23.920> except<00:01:24.790> for<00:01:25.030> the

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
the other knobs turn down except for the

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.780 
the other knobs turn down except for the
EQ<00:01:25.570> knobs<00:01:25.720> are<00:01:25.990> at<00:01:26.140> their<00:01:26.380> detent<00:01:26.950> or<00:01:27.220> the<00:01:27.490> top

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
EQ knobs are at their detent or the top

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.070 
EQ knobs are at their detent or the top
right<00:01:28.120> in<00:01:28.210> the<00:01:28.270> middle<00:01:28.480> there's<00:01:28.780> a<00:01:28.840> little

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
right in the middle there's a little

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.360 
right in the middle there's a little
spot<00:01:29.320> there<00:01:29.500> where<00:01:29.650> you<00:01:29.710> can<00:01:29.800> feel<00:01:29.950> it<00:01:30.100> click

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.370 
spot there where you can feel it click

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.280 
spot there where you can feel it click
ok<00:01:31.060> so<00:01:31.120> those<00:01:31.420> are<00:01:31.480> left<00:01:31.750> in<00:01:31.900> the<00:01:31.990> middle

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
ok so those are left in the middle

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.220 
ok so those are left in the middle
everything<00:01:33.040> else<00:01:33.250> is<00:01:33.520> turn<00:01:34.450> down<00:01:34.780> the<00:01:35.020> pan

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:35.230 
everything else is turn down the pan

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.220 
everything else is turn down the pan
knob<00:01:35.440> is<00:01:35.650> Center<00:01:36.100> but<00:01:36.910> the<00:01:37.120> volume<00:01:37.390> knobs<00:01:37.780> the

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:38.230 
knob is Center but the volume knobs the

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:39.780 
knob is Center but the volume knobs the
channel<00:01:38.680> faders<00:01:39.010> and<00:01:39.220> the<00:01:39.280> main<00:01:39.430> fader<00:01:39.640> are

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
channel faders and the main fader are

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.880 
channel faders and the main fader are
down<00:01:39.940> and<00:01:40.150> the<00:01:40.240> gain<00:01:40.420> is<00:01:40.600> down<00:01:40.750> as<00:01:40.930> well<00:01:41.110> so

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
down and the gain is down as well so

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.480 
down and the gain is down as well so
what<00:01:42.070> we'll<00:01:42.220> do<00:01:42.430> is<00:01:42.640> we<00:01:42.970> will<00:01:43.150> just<00:01:43.690> start<00:01:44.140> to

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
what we'll do is we will just start to

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.520 
what we'll do is we will just start to
what<00:01:45.490> will<00:01:45.670> come<00:01:45.850> up<00:01:46.000> on<00:01:46.120> our<00:01:46.480> gain<00:01:46.750> almost<00:01:47.380> all

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
what will come up on our gain almost all

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.440 
what will come up on our gain almost all
the<00:01:47.680> way<00:01:47.860> because<00:01:48.670> we<00:01:48.850> need<00:01:49.000> a<00:01:49.030> lot<00:01:49.210> of<00:01:49.300> gain

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
the way because we need a lot of gain

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.660 
the way because we need a lot of gain
for<00:01:49.480> this<00:01:49.690> microphone<00:01:50.170> it's<00:01:50.350> an<00:01:50.410> ATR<00:01:50.770> 2100<00:01:51.250> and

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
for this microphone it's an ATR 2100 and

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.260 
for this microphone it's an ATR 2100 and
we<00:01:52.240> have<00:01:52.390> 60<00:01:52.720> DB<00:01:53.080> of<00:01:53.110> gain<00:01:53.260> on<00:01:53.740> this<00:01:54.100> mic<00:01:54.370> so<00:01:54.700> I'm

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270

here<00:02:19.760> on<00:02:19.880> the<00:02:19.970> main<00:02:20.150> meters<00:02:21.110> and<00:02:21.349> that's<00:02:21.739> what

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
here on the main meters and that's what

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.979 
here on the main meters and that's what
we<00:02:22.040> want<00:02:22.250> to<00:02:22.310> see<00:02:22.489> so<00:02:22.760> we've<00:02:23.330> set<00:02:23.599> up<00:02:23.630> this

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
we want to see so we've set up this

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.949 
we want to see so we've set up this
channel<00:02:24.560> properly<00:02:25.520> if<00:02:26.450> you're<00:02:26.630> going<00:02:26.720> to<00:02:26.810> want

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
channel properly if you're going to want

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.420 
channel properly if you're going to want
to<00:02:26.989> move<00:02:27.140> over<00:02:27.290> and<00:02:27.560> set<00:02:27.680> up<00:02:27.770> another<00:02:28.069> channel

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
to move over and set up another channel

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.920 
to move over and set up another channel
you're<00:02:28.580> going<00:02:28.730> to<00:02:28.790> want<00:02:28.940> to<00:02:29.030> do<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.690> same

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
you're going to want to do the same

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.800 
you're going to want to do the same
exact<00:02:30.290> process<00:02:30.530> for<00:02:31.400> each<00:02:31.610> channel<00:02:32.510> that<00:02:32.720> you

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
exact process for each channel that you

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.839 
exact process for each channel that you
have<00:02:32.930> a<00:02:32.959> microphone<00:02:33.440> on<00:02:33.500> and<00:02:33.920> then<00:02:34.610> you<00:02:34.730> will

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
have a microphone on and then you will

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.900 
have a microphone on and then you will
have<00:02:35.000> a<00:02:35.030> nice<00:02:35.450> gain<00:02:36.140> staged<00:02:36.470> mixer<00:02:37.250> the<00:02:37.760> other

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
have a nice gain staged mixer the other

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.610 
have a nice gain staged mixer the other
way<00:02:38.090> to<00:02:38.150> go<00:02:38.300> about<00:02:38.510> this<00:02:38.750> which<00:02:39.080> is<00:02:39.260> probably

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
way to go about this which is probably

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.690 
way to go about this which is probably
better<00:02:40.190> is<00:02:40.519> to<00:02:41.269> go<00:02:41.900> ahead<00:02:42.019> and<00:02:42.410> bring<00:02:43.250> your

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
better is to go ahead and bring your

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.270 
better is to go ahead and bring your
channel<00:02:44.300> level<00:02:44.959> the<00:02:45.140> microphone<00:02:45.590> right<00:02:46.010> up<00:02:46.040> to

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
channel level the microphone right up to

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.470 
channel level the microphone right up to
zero<00:02:46.549> and<00:02:46.850> do<00:02:47.510> the<00:02:47.660> same<00:02:47.900> for<00:02:48.440> your<00:02:48.769> main

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
zero and do the same for your main

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.809 
zero and do the same for your main
output<00:02:50.480> there<00:02:50.750> and<00:02:50.989> then<00:02:51.530> talk<00:02:52.190> normal<00:02:52.640> as

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
output there and then talk normal as

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:54.720 
output there and then talk normal as
loud<00:02:53.000> as<00:02:53.090> you're<00:02:53.180> going<00:02:53.360> to<00:02:53.450> talk<00:02:53.690> in<00:02:53.930> the

loud as you're going to talk in the

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.660 
loud as you're going to talk in the
recording<00:02:55.730> bring<00:02:56.450> your<00:02:56.900> gain<00:02:57.830> knob<00:02:58.040> right<00:02:58.489> up

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
recording bring your gain knob right up

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.910 
recording bring your gain knob right up
to<00:02:58.849> where<00:02:59.060> you<00:02:59.209> are<00:02:59.540> seeing<00:02:59.930> that<00:03:00.739> your

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
to where you are seeing that your

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.280 
to where you are seeing that your
loudest<00:03:01.160> parts<00:03:01.730> of<00:03:01.940> your<00:03:02.360> normal<00:03:02.660> speech<00:03:03.019> are

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
loudest parts of your normal speech are

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.009 
loudest parts of your normal speech are
hitting<00:03:03.650> in<00:03:03.860> the<00:03:04.160> zero<00:03:04.459> okay<00:03:05.360> so<00:03:05.390> this<00:03:05.690> mixer

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
hitting in the zero okay so this mixer

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.380 
hitting in the zero okay so this mixer
wants<00:03:06.290> to<00:03:06.380> be<00:03:06.560> right<00:03:07.280> at<00:03:07.459> zero<00:03:07.760> is<00:03:08.060> a<00:03:08.090> good

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
wants to be right at zero is a good

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.199 
wants to be right at zero is a good
place<00:03:08.690> on<00:03:09.019> an<00:03:09.680> analog<00:03:09.980> mixer<00:03:10.580> and<00:03:10.790> you<00:03:10.940> can<00:03:11.090> see

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
place on an analog mixer and you can see

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.900 
place on an analog mixer and you can see
we<00:03:11.360> still<00:03:11.510> have<00:03:11.750> all<00:03:12.200> this<00:03:13.010> Headroom<00:03:13.519> see<00:03:13.849> I

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
we still have all this Headroom see I

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.699 
we still have all this Headroom see I
can<00:03:14.090> get<00:03:14.180> excited<00:03:14.299> a<00:03:14.540> Headroom<00:03:14.930> into<00:03:15.380> the<00:03:15.470> six

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
can get excited a Headroom into the six

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.140 
can get excited a Headroom into the six
if<00:03:15.980> I<00:03:16.069> get<00:03:16.190> really<00:03:16.340> excited<00:03:16.459> we<00:03:16.819> have<00:03:16.849> enough

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
if I get really excited we have enough

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.599 
if I get really excited we have enough
Headroom<00:03:17.329> and<00:03:17.630> the<00:03:18.620> audio<00:03:18.920> sounds<00:03:19.280> really

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:19.609 
Headroom and the audio sounds really

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.060 
Headroom and the audio sounds really
nice<00:03:19.850> and<00:03:19.910> clean<00:03:20.299> so<00:03:21.200> this<00:03:21.350> is<00:03:21.500> exactly<00:03:21.799> where

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
nice and clean so this is exactly where

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.910 
nice and clean so this is exactly where
this<00:03:22.190> mixer<00:03:22.579> wants<00:03:23.209> to<00:03:23.359> be<00:03:23.570> okay<00:03:24.470> so<00:03:24.530> we've<00:03:24.890> got

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
this mixer wants to be okay so we've got

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.140 
this mixer wants to be okay so we've got
our<00:03:25.190> gain<00:03:25.810> adjusted<00:03:26.810> to<00:03:26.989> where<00:03:27.230> our<00:03:27.910> voice<00:03:28.910> is

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
our gain adjusted to where our voice is

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.380 
our gain adjusted to where our voice is
hitting<00:03:29.359> into<00:03:29.510> the<00:03:29.690> zero<00:03:30.430> when<00:03:31.430> our<00:03:31.700> channel

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
hitting into the zero when our channel

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.860 
hitting into the zero when our channel
fader<00:03:32.600> and<00:03:32.870> our<00:03:33.470> main<00:03:33.680> mix<00:03:33.980> knob<00:03:34.220> is<00:03:34.459> in<00:03:35.299> its

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
fader and our main mix knob is in its

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.780 
fader and our main mix knob is in its
detent<00:03:36.350> or<00:03:36.530> zero<00:03:36.859> position<00:03:37.130> so<00:03:37.640> that's

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
detent or zero position so that's

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.789 
detent or zero position so that's
looking<00:03:38.030> really<00:03:38.359> good<00:03:38.720> so<00:03:38.930> that's<00:03:39.530> the<00:03:39.650> two

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 
looking really good so that's the two

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:42.879 
looking really good so that's the two

able<00:03:46.609> to<00:03:46.730> go<00:03:46.940> to<00:03:47.000> any<00:03:47.209> mixer<00:03:47.720> and<00:03:47.900> set<00:03:48.440> it<00:03:48.590> up

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
able to go to any mixer and set it up

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.330 
able to go to any mixer and set it up
and<00:03:48.980> have<00:03:49.190> it<00:03:49.340> sound<00:03:49.579> great<00:03:50.389> now<00:03:51.319> again<00:03:52.100> if

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
and have it sound great now again if

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:55.660 
and have it sound great now again if
your<00:03:53.239> gain<00:03:53.540> knob<00:03:54.109> is<00:03:54.410> all<00:03:54.950> the<00:03:55.100> way<00:03:55.190> up<00:03:55.220> and

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
your gain knob is all the way up and

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.520 
your gain knob is all the way up and
it's<00:03:55.819> creating<00:03:56.150> noise<00:03:56.329> the<00:03:56.690> mixer<00:03:57.200> the

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
it's creating noise the mixer the

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.110 
it's creating noise the mixer the
preamps<00:03:57.950> inside<00:03:58.160> the<00:03:58.250> mixer<00:03:58.549> might<00:03:58.730> not<00:03:58.940> be

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
preamps inside the mixer might not be

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.879 
preamps inside the mixer might not be
that<00:03:59.269> good<00:03:59.510> but<00:03:59.750> even<00:03:59.840> on<00:04:00.049> this<00:04:00.170> very<00:04:00.500> cheap

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:00.889 
that good but even on this very cheap

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:03.460 
that good but even on this very cheap
bérenger<00:04:01.819> mixer<00:04:02.209> on<00:04:02.420> some<00:04:02.630> very<00:04:02.840> cheap<00:04:03.139> Mackie

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
bérenger mixer on some very cheap Mackie

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.340 
bérenger mixer on some very cheap Mackie
mixers<00:04:04.150> they<00:04:05.150> have<00:04:05.389> cramps<00:04:05.690> that<00:04:05.870> work<00:04:06.049> really

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
mixers they have cramps that work really

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.860 
mixers they have cramps that work really
well<00:04:06.650> so<00:04:07.130> you<00:04:07.400> know<00:04:08.030> you<00:04:08.090> can<00:04:08.329> compensate<00:04:08.630> a

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
well so you know you can compensate a

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.569 
well so you know you can compensate a
little<00:04:09.139> for<00:04:09.350> that<00:04:09.500> by<00:04:09.889> coming<00:04:10.160> down<00:04:10.190> on<00:04:10.489> the

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:10.579 
little for that by coming down on the

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:12.640 
little for that by coming down on the
gain<00:04:10.790> and<00:04:11.030> maybe<00:04:11.569> adjusting<00:04:12.049> with<00:04:12.139> the<00:04:12.260> faders

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
gain and maybe adjusting with the faders

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.430 
gain and maybe adjusting with the faders
but<00:04:13.519> ideally<00:04:13.819> you'll<00:04:14.120> set<00:04:14.359> it<00:04:14.389> properly<00:04:14.630> from

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
but ideally you'll set it properly from

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.960 
but ideally you'll set it properly from
the<00:04:15.530> top<00:04:15.829> all<00:04:16.220> the<00:04:16.280> way<00:04:16.579> through<00:04:16.789> the<00:04:16.880> entire

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
the top all the way through the entire

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.140 
the top all the way through the entire
mixer<00:04:17.600> to<00:04:18.169> get<00:04:18.320> the<00:04:18.440> best<00:04:18.680> levels<00:04:19.370> you<00:04:19.549> can<00:04:19.850> for

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
mixer to get the best levels you can for

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.420 
mixer to get the best levels you can for
the<00:04:20.209> cleanest<00:04:20.630> sound<00:04:20.780> all<00:04:21.560> right<00:04:21.859> I<00:04:22.010> will<00:04:22.130> see

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
the cleanest sound all right I will see

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.060 
the cleanest sound all right I will see
you<00:04:22.729> next<00:04:22.940> time
