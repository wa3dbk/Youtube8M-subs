00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:10.190
 very good girls very good guys and 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.280
 today we are in great news of xbox 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:15.500
 world and is that at the beginning everything is why 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:18.860
 infinity ward has explained because I met 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.320
 last does not run at 1080p in xbox one 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:24.410
 from everyone because this is what the 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.020
 company has said the reality and out of 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.330
 speculations the study does not recognize 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:32.960
 to work on his first game in 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:36.589
 action has not been easy decision 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:40.280
 of doing that he knew scams with the 720p 

00:00:36.589 --> 00:00:42.109
 instead of 1080p in xbox world it does not 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.359
 owes to any particular element of 

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:46.339
 a console since they say that in the 

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:49.839
 next games you can move this 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:49.839
 resolution without problems 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.490
 and that you owe more general aspects of 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.860
 game vale marc robin producer 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:01:00.220
 action game executive explains to 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:03.010
 eurogamer who made the decision does 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.260
 about a month because no 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.690
 they got the rate of images by 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.290
 seconds that they were looking for and not 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:13.420
 they wanted to take unnecessary risks 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:17.140
 It has is now very possible that 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:20.140
 we end up reaching 1080p in fact 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:23.080
 I've seen known guys running at 1080p in 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.930
 xbox one the only thing is that we could not 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.420
 maintain the frame rate which is the rate of 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.759
 images per second will see the fps going 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:34.320
 to have we could not keep the frame 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:36.840
 desired rate in the games 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.880
 the equal infinity member assures you 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.220
 that there is no specific aspect 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.100
 of the xbox one that does not allow them 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.890
 reach 1080p and expect that custom 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.710
 to work with the microsoft console 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:52.200
 get better results in the future 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.840
 remember that in playstation 4 with the 10 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.220
 children if it works in 1080p the rate of 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.410
 images per second to which it is 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.500
 used to the activision license 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.390
 is 60 fps is figure that are not 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.440
 willing to sacrifice for the 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:10.140
 resolution so conclusion of this 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.739
 that it is much easier to work for 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.720
 pepsi are four that for xbox world and 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:18.390
 that is choking the console 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.180
 of Microsoft so clear has said the 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.790
 marc rubin member and that's what there is 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.950
 because he does not run at 1080p in this 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.430
 generation because they have it there would be 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.380
 sing the console and for now not 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.870
 they want to risk that's why he said that 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.030
 in the future if we achieve 1080p but not 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.870
 now because now nor they have failed 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.680
 they do not have enough time 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:44.709
 to optimize their resources to get the 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.989
 1,080 or what conclusion of all this 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.930
 that it is much harder to work for 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:52.599
 xbox one that for playstation 4 so 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:57.129
 You know , I do not say it, I say it more 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:59.640
 rubin one of the favorites we see the 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:59.640
 following
