00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:19.130
 now we will knit with a thread of white color 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:24.290
 hook under the back half loop 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:28.220
 at the base of the circle we capture white 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:53.710
 thread and knit 11 air 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:53.710
 loops 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and 11 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:01.690
 miss 2 loops and into the third 

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:01.690
 loop we knit a column without nakida 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.960
 next loop we knit a semi-column with 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.960
 nakidom 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.430
 Next, knit 5 posts with one nakida 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.040
 one 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.740
 2 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.030
 perry 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:55.670
 4 and 5 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:07.560
 then knit a semi-cap with a crochet 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:11.930
 next loop and last loop 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:15.720
 we take a hook and take out a loop 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:18.230
 then we put the hook under the back 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.230
 half a loop 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:29.420
 the next loop of the circle and take out 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:29.420
 knit the loop three loops together 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:44.100
 now turn the work to another 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:46.940
 side skip loop a in 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:53.430
 the base and the next loop 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:57.150
 we knit a connecting loop and further 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.780
 knit on the perimeter of the connecting 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.780
 eyelets 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:14.610
 dovyazavat to the top of the petal then 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:17.930
 knit one air loop and knit 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:20.930
 connecting loops on the other hand 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.930
 petals 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.160
 knit the very last loop 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:39.170
 in the following way 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:42.620
 we put the hook in the eyelet 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:46.050
 of our petal and take out a loop 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:49.160
 then we put in that loop from where we have 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:53.060
 our petal was starting 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:58.800
 pull out the loop and drag and and 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:04:01.740
 then you can knit next 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:05.610
 we need a petal for this 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:08.070
 get over this loop from here 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:10.760
 the next petal will begin 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:13.710
 and we can do it with 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:19.220
 we knit a connecting loop 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:19.220
 coupling loop here in this loop 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:28.260
 that's how i do it from the wrong side 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.740
 work 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:34.680
 I drive a loop so that you have loops 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.270
 not visible and knitting connective 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:40.890
 noose 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:45.300
 and knit the next connecting loop 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:54.720
 already here in this loop 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:57.090
 yellow and here's the petal ready and 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.390
 you can start knitting next 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:04.080
 petals fit in the same way 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:08.730
 knit again a chain of 11 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:13.430
 air loops and then knit since I 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:18.950
 already shown this way we knit 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:18.950
 all the petals of our chamomile 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:26.330
 when all the petals are connected 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:29.940
 such a big daisy will turn out 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:35.480
 further knit another middle core since i 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:35.480
 already showed we take a piece of fleece 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:46.310
 we put it in the center of the flower 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:50.120
 we put in the center of the second middle and 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:54.650
 with the help of a needle 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.650
 sew it to the flower 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:15.110
 now the daisy is ready and you can decorate 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:15.110
 its leaves
