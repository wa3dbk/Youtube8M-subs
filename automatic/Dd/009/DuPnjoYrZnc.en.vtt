we're going to continue building our
drum<00:00:05.750> set<00:00:06.020> sound<00:00:06.350> we're<00:00:06.680> starting<00:00:07.010> off<00:00:07.130> with

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:07.160 
drum set sound we're starting off with

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.310 
drum set sound we're starting off with
the<00:00:07.370> kick<00:00:08.120> drum<00:00:08.149> as<00:00:08.450> our<00:00:08.570> foundation<00:00:08.930> with<00:00:09.230> the

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:09.320 
the kick drum as our foundation with the

overheads with the 80 X 51
these<00:00:15.380> are<00:00:15.530> pencil<00:00:15.860> condenser<00:00:16.250> diaphragms<00:00:16.699> to

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:16.880 
these are pencil condenser diaphragms to

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.490 
these are pencil condenser diaphragms to
give<00:00:17.000> us<00:00:17.090> more<00:00:17.269> of<00:00:17.330> a<00:00:17.420> full<00:00:17.600> sound<00:00:17.960> what<00:00:18.439> we

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500 
give us more of a full sound what we

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.929 
give us more of a full sound what we
want<00:00:18.680> to<00:00:18.740> do<00:00:18.800> now<00:00:18.949> is<00:00:19.160> fill<00:00:19.400> in<00:00:19.550> the<00:00:19.640> middle

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:19.939 
want to do now is fill in the middle

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:21.669 
want to do now is fill in the middle
with<00:00:20.150> the<00:00:20.300> Tom's<00:00:20.570> with<00:00:21.140> the<00:00:21.230> D<00:00:21.410> Series

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:21.679 
with the Tom's with the D Series

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:23.200 
with the Tom's with the D Series
microphones<00:00:22.310> which<00:00:22.490> Michael<00:00:22.699> talked<00:00:22.939> about

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
microphones which Michael talked about

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.029 
microphones which Michael talked about
the<00:00:23.390> D<00:00:23.599> series<00:00:24.019> are<00:00:24.259> specifically<00:00:24.800> designed

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 
the D series are specifically designed

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.179 
the D series are specifically designed
for<00:00:25.460> Tom's<00:00:25.939> and<00:00:26.269> like<00:00:26.630> the<00:00:26.779> i-5<00:00:27.140> like<00:00:27.409> the<00:00:27.529> d6

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
for Tom's and like the i-5 like the d6

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:30.729 
for Tom's and like the i-5 like the d6
they<00:00:28.730> have<00:00:29.029> a<00:00:29.300> specially<00:00:29.779> designed<00:00:29.960> frequency

00:00:30.729 --> 00:00:30.739 
they have a specially designed frequency

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:34.210 
they have a specially designed frequency
response<00:00:31.159> curve<00:00:31.519> that<00:00:32.390> is<00:00:32.750> tailored<00:00:33.410> to<00:00:33.620> what

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:34.220 
response curve that is tailored to what

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.300 
response curve that is tailored to what
a<00:00:34.489> TomTom<00:00:34.850> needs<00:00:35.390> to<00:00:35.960> sound<00:00:36.230> good<00:00:36.500> it's

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:37.310 
a TomTom needs to sound good it's

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.730 
a TomTom needs to sound good it's
essentially<00:00:37.910> what<00:00:38.120> the<00:00:38.300> sound<00:00:38.540> person<00:00:38.840> live

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:39.740 
essentially what the sound person live

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.370 
essentially what the sound person live
would<00:00:40.280> do<00:00:40.550> with<00:00:41.060> the<00:00:41.180> EQ<00:00:41.660> to<00:00:41.930> make<00:00:42.050> the<00:00:42.200> drum

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:42.380 
would do with the EQ to make the drum

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.220 
would do with the EQ to make the drum
sound<00:00:42.620> good<00:00:42.820> so<00:00:43.820> here<00:00:44.060> I'm<00:00:44.180> using<00:00:44.210> D<00:00:44.600> to<00:00:44.840> s<00:00:44.900> on

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
sound good so here I'm using D to s on

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.200 
sound good so here I'm using D to s on
the<00:00:45.380> track<00:00:45.590> Tom's<00:00:45.890> it's<00:00:46.160> a<00:00:46.220> very<00:00:46.430> common<00:00:46.730> usage

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
the track Tom's it's a very common usage

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.150 
the track Tom's it's a very common usage
like<00:00:48.050> the<00:00:48.200> snare<00:00:48.410> drum<00:00:48.620> there<00:00:48.800> are<00:00:48.890> two

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
like the snare drum there are two

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.220 
like the snare drum there are two
positions<00:00:50.920> one<00:00:51.920> is<00:00:52.310> as<00:00:52.550> you<00:00:52.670> can<00:00:52.700> see<00:00:53.230> center

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
positions one is as you can see center

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.470 
positions one is as you can see center
of<00:00:54.320> the<00:00:54.380> mic<00:00:54.590> is<00:00:55.120> pointed<00:00:56.120> towards<00:00:56.300> the<00:00:56.330> center

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
of the mic is pointed towards the center

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.950 
of the mic is pointed towards the center
of<00:00:56.600> the<00:00:56.720> drum<00:00:58.210> that's<00:00:59.210> going<00:00:59.480> to<00:00:59.540> accentuate

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
of the drum that's going to accentuate

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.370 
of the drum that's going to accentuate
the<00:01:00.560> fundamental<00:01:01.130> pitch<00:01:01.250> of<00:01:01.400> the<00:01:01.460> drum<00:01:01.579> and

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:02.380 
the fundamental pitch of the drum and

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.200 
the fundamental pitch of the drum and
minimize<00:01:03.380> the<00:01:03.770> decay<00:01:04.070> or<00:01:04.250> the<00:01:04.400> ring<00:01:04.699> of<00:01:05.000> the

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
minimize the decay or the ring of the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.390 
minimize the decay or the ring of the
drum<00:01:05.449> this<00:01:06.140> position<00:01:06.680> I'm<00:01:06.950> going<00:01:07.159> to<00:01:07.280> get<00:01:07.369> a

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
drum this position I'm going to get a

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.460 
drum this position I'm going to get a
little<00:01:07.670> more<00:01:07.790> bleed<00:01:08.180> from<00:01:08.540> the<00:01:08.720> other<00:01:08.930> tom

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
little more bleed from the other tom

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.620 
little more bleed from the other tom
toms<00:01:09.820> definitely<00:01:10.820> from<00:01:10.970> the<00:01:11.090> snare<00:01:11.360> drum<00:01:11.600> and

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
toms definitely from the snare drum and

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.899 
toms definitely from the snare drum and
a<00:01:11.840> little<00:01:11.990> bit<00:01:12.080> from<00:01:12.260> the<00:01:12.350> cymbals<00:01:12.800> if<00:01:13.550> I<00:01:13.730> want

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
a little bit from the cymbals if I want

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:15.580 
a little bit from the cymbals if I want
to<00:01:14.000> minimize<00:01:14.090> that<00:01:14.570> bleed<00:01:14.870> what<00:01:15.320> I'm<00:01:15.409> going<00:01:15.560> to

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
to minimize that bleed what I'm going to

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.290 
to minimize that bleed what I'm going to
do<00:01:15.800> is<00:01:16.070> just<00:01:16.960> simply<00:01:17.960> point<00:01:18.580> the<00:01:19.580> mic<00:01:19.820> down

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
do is just simply point the mic down

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.149 
do is just simply point the mic down
towards<00:01:20.720> the<00:01:20.810> edge<00:01:20.930> of<00:01:21.050> the<00:01:21.140> drum<00:01:21.350> this<00:01:21.979> will

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
towards the edge of the drum this will

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:26.160 
towards the edge of the drum this will
reject<00:01:22.729> some<00:01:23.210> of<00:01:23.240> the<00:01:23.330> sounds<00:01:24.550> nearby<00:01:25.550> and

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
reject some of the sounds nearby and

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.730 
reject some of the sounds nearby and
will<00:01:27.170> give<00:01:27.350> us<00:01:27.500> more<00:01:27.860> of<00:01:27.920> a<00:01:28.100> ringy<00:01:28.340> sound<00:01:29.740> this

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
will give us more of a ringy sound this

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.530 
will give us more of a ringy sound this
is<00:01:30.800> a<00:01:30.950> good<00:01:31.190> position<00:01:31.580> for<00:01:32.799> jazz<00:01:33.799> gigs<00:01:34.540> jazz

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
is a good position for jazz gigs jazz

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.920 
is a good position for jazz gigs jazz
style<00:01:36.409> sounds<00:01:37.130> of<00:01:37.630> something<00:01:38.630> but<00:01:38.750> I<00:01:38.780> need<00:01:38.900> a

all<00:01:57.470> the<00:01:57.830> mic<00:01:58.010> scans<00:01:58.280> are<00:01:58.460> getting<00:01:58.640> positioned

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
all the mic scans are getting positioned

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.080 
all the mic scans are getting positioned
and<00:01:59.510> and<00:01:59.780> the<00:02:00.680> messiness<00:02:01.100> they<00:02:01.460> create<00:02:01.880> on

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
and and the messiness they create on

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.440 
and and the messiness they create on
stage<00:02:02.420> here<00:02:03.140> you<00:02:03.680> simply<00:02:04.100> just<00:02:04.280> clip<00:02:04.670> onto<00:02:04.970> the

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
stage here you simply just clip onto the

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.229 
stage here you simply just clip onto the
rim<00:02:05.630> any<00:02:05.979> standard<00:02:06.979> triple<00:02:07.340> flange<00:02:07.729> or<00:02:08.030> cast

rim<00:02:08.629> they<00:02:09.619> have<00:02:09.769> versions<00:02:10.189> to<00:02:10.459> that'll<00:02:10.759> work

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:10.909 
rim they have versions to that'll work

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:13.390 
rim they have versions to that'll work
with<00:02:11.180> some<00:02:11.450> of<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:11.599> more<00:02:12.130> advanced<00:02:13.130> or<00:02:13.220> newer

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
with some of the more advanced or newer

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.950 
with some of the more advanced or newer
design<00:02:13.790> of<00:02:13.940> rims<00:02:14.120> -<00:02:14.450> like<00:02:14.810> Zee<00:02:15.170> rims

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
design of rims - like Zee rims

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.560 
design of rims - like Zee rims
and<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:16.680> whatnot<00:02:17.160> here's<00:02:18.060> what<00:02:18.270> the<00:02:18.360> Tom's

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
and and whatnot here's what the Tom's

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.990 
and and whatnot here's what the Tom's
sound<00:02:18.900> like<00:02:19.110> with<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:19.980> mic<00:02:20.190> pointed<00:02:20.610> towards

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
sound like with the mic pointed towards

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.460 
sound like with the mic pointed towards
the<00:02:21.060> center<00:02:21.300> of<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.510> drum<00:02:21.690> again<00:02:22.080> to

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
the center of the drum again to

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:34.699 
the center of the drum again to
accentuate<00:02:23.100> the<00:02:23.220> fundamental<00:02:23.670> pitch

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.140 

it<00:02:35.709> definitely<00:02:35.860> gives<00:02:36.189> it<00:02:36.280> a<00:02:36.340> more<00:02:36.519> full<00:02:36.819> sound

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
it definitely gives it a more full sound

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.509 
it definitely gives it a more full sound
of<00:02:37.239> the<00:02:37.329> actual<00:02:37.870> drum<00:02:38.049> absolutely<00:02:38.829> does<00:02:39.040> now

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
of the actual drum absolutely does now

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.220 
of the actual drum absolutely does now
I'm<00:02:39.700> going<00:02:39.849> to<00:02:39.909> point<00:02:40.060> them<00:02:40.450> down<00:02:40.480> slightly

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
I'm going to point them down slightly

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.530 
I'm going to point them down slightly
towards<00:02:41.829> the<00:02:42.189> rim<00:02:42.340> of<00:02:42.370> the<00:02:42.549> drum<00:02:42.670> where<00:02:43.209> all

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
towards the rim of the drum where all

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.770 
towards the rim of the drum where all
the<00:02:43.989> ring<00:02:44.349> of<00:02:44.709> drums<00:02:45.670> comes<00:02:46.150> from<00:02:46.510> and<00:02:46.720> that's

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
the ring of drums comes from and that's

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.649 
the ring of drums comes from and that's
the<00:02:46.900> high<00:02:47.140> frequency<00:02:47.709> content<00:02:47.860> and<00:02:48.659> let's

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:49.659 
the high frequency content and let's

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:51.809 
the high frequency content and let's
hear<00:02:50.049> the<00:02:50.140> difference<00:02:50.500> less<00:02:51.489> fundamental

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
hear the difference less fundamental

00:02:51.819 --> 00:03:04.850 
hear the difference less fundamental
more<00:02:52.510> high-end<00:02:53.049> ring

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.770 

you<00:03:05.490> can<00:03:05.610> hear<00:03:05.760> more<00:03:05.880> of<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.060> overtones<00:03:06.540> in

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
you can hear more of the overtones in

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.450 
you can hear more of the overtones in
that<00:03:06.900> situation<00:03:07.440> absolutely<00:03:09.320> the<00:03:10.320> d4<00:03:10.830> again

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 
that situation absolutely the d4 again

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.780 
that situation absolutely the d4 again
has<00:03:12.150> a<00:03:12.380> specially<00:03:13.380> tuned<00:03:13.650> frequency<00:03:14.130> response

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
has a specially tuned frequency response

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.940 
has a specially tuned frequency response
curve<00:03:15.000> built<00:03:15.270> into<00:03:15.600> it<00:03:15.750> it's<00:03:16.380> perfect<00:03:16.890> for

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
curve built into it it's perfect for

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.520 
curve built into it it's perfect for
floor<00:03:17.280> toms<00:03:17.520> now<00:03:18.360> floor<00:03:18.750> tom<00:03:18.960> position<00:03:19.350> is<00:03:19.440> a

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
floor toms now floor tom position is a

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.470 
floor toms now floor tom position is a
little<00:03:19.560> bit<00:03:20.250> different<00:03:20.730> than<00:03:20.880> rack<00:03:21.150> toms

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
little bit different than rack toms

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.840 
little bit different than rack toms
because<00:03:22.050> they<00:03:22.170> have<00:03:22.290> so<00:03:22.590> much<00:03:22.770> low<00:03:23.070> end<00:03:23.100> and<00:03:23.610> so

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
because they have so much low end and so

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.630 
because they have so much low end and so
much<00:03:24.030> ring<00:03:24.330> generally<00:03:24.930> you<00:03:25.890> see<00:03:26.070> its<00:03:26.250> pointed

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
much ring generally you see its pointed

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.730 
much ring generally you see its pointed
towards<00:03:26.880> the<00:03:26.970> center<00:03:27.330> this<00:03:28.140> is<00:03:28.290> pretty<00:03:28.590> much

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
towards the center this is pretty much

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.240 
towards the center this is pretty much
this<00:03:29.640> the<00:03:30.450> position<00:03:31.440> I'm<00:03:31.560> going<00:03:31.740> to<00:03:31.800> use<00:03:32.070> all

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
this the position I'm going to use all

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.250 
this the position I'm going to use all
the<00:03:32.640> time<00:03:32.880> and<00:03:33.209> you'll<00:03:33.660> hear<00:03:33.959> the<00:03:34.140> difference

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
the time and you'll hear the difference

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.120 
the time and you'll hear the difference
so<00:03:35.160> this<00:03:35.400> is<00:03:35.640> with<00:03:36.540> the<00:03:37.140> mic<00:03:37.350> towards<00:03:37.650> the

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
so this is with the mic towards the

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.040 
so this is with the mic towards the
center<00:03:38.400> of<00:03:38.430> the<00:03:38.520> drum<00:03:38.730> a<00:03:39.030> lot<00:03:39.630> of<00:03:39.750> fundamental

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
center of the drum a lot of fundamental

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:47.390 
center of the drum a lot of fundamental
minimizes<00:03:41.040> the<00:03:41.220> ring<00:03:41.550> of<00:03:41.700> the<00:03:41.790> drum<00:03:46.220> as<00:03:47.220> you

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
minimizes the ring of the drum as you

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:53.300 
minimizes the ring of the drum as you
can<00:03:47.489> see<00:03:47.580> it's<00:03:47.700> bringing<00:03:48.060> a<00:03:48.120> drum<00:03:52.010> now<00:03:53.010> listen

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
can see it's bringing a drum now listen

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.610 
can see it's bringing a drum now listen
what<00:03:53.400> happens<00:03:53.790> when<00:03:54.120> I<00:03:54.150> put<00:03:54.420> the<00:03:54.510> mic<00:03:54.720> towards

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
what happens when I put the mic towards

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.000 
what happens when I put the mic towards
the<00:03:56.160> edge<00:03:56.370> of<00:03:56.700> the<00:03:56.940> drum<00:03:57.209> that<00:03:58.110> ring<00:03:58.620> is<00:03:58.860> going

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
the edge of the drum that ring is going

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.550 
the edge of the drum that ring is going
to<00:03:59.070> become<00:03:59.340> uncontrollable<00:04:00.090> it's<00:04:00.870> not<00:04:01.260> a<00:04:01.290> good

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
to become uncontrollable it's not a good

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:08.960 
to become uncontrollable it's not a good
thing

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.030 

this<00:04:09.970> is<00:04:10.120> why<00:04:10.360> you<00:04:11.200> want<00:04:11.379> a<00:04:11.410> position<00:04:11.800> to<00:04:11.890> mic

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
this is why you want a position to mic

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.360 
this is why you want a position to mic
pointing<00:04:13.030> towards<00:04:13.239> the<00:04:13.300> center<00:04:13.540> of<00:04:13.629> the<00:04:13.690> drum

the<00:04:15.370> d-series<00:04:15.790> mics<00:04:16.269> are<00:04:16.690> also

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
the d-series mics are also

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.310 
the d-series mics are also
hyper-cardioid<00:04:18.720> that<00:04:19.720> means<00:04:19.989> that<00:04:20.169> their

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
hyper-cardioid that means that their

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.140 
hyper-cardioid that means that their
pattern<00:04:20.919> or<00:04:21.070> pickup<00:04:21.430> pattern<00:04:21.609> what<00:04:22.030> they

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
pattern or pickup pattern what they

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.680 
pattern or pickup pattern what they
focus<00:04:22.660> on<00:04:22.810> is<00:04:23.050> very<00:04:23.560> tight<00:04:23.889> and<00:04:24.130> narrow

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
focus on is very tight and narrow

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.270 
focus on is very tight and narrow
towards<00:04:25.690> the<00:04:25.840> front<00:04:26.080> of<00:04:26.169> the<00:04:26.229> mic<00:04:26.440> this<00:04:27.100> will

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
towards the front of the mic this will

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.060 
towards the front of the mic this will
reject<00:04:27.820> sounds<00:04:28.510> around<00:04:28.900> it<00:04:29.169> like<00:04:29.710> in<00:04:29.919> this

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
reject sounds around it like in this

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.420 
reject sounds around it like in this
case<00:04:30.280> the<00:04:31.150> ride<00:04:31.360> cymbal<00:04:31.870> and<00:04:32.050> and<00:04:32.830> the<00:04:33.190> snare
