what<00:00:12.030> I'm<00:00:12.120> going<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.300> show<00:00:12.420> you<00:00:12.480> today<00:00:12.630> is<00:00:13.349> an

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
what I'm going to show you today is an

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:25.279 
what I'm going to show you today is an
electronic<00:00:14.400> shifter<00:00:23.900> so<00:00:24.900> what<00:00:25.080> I've<00:00:25.170> done

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
electronic shifter so what I've done

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.400 
electronic shifter so what I've done
here<00:00:25.350> is<00:00:25.590> taken<00:00:26.189> an<00:00:26.460> ordinary<00:00:27.260> derailleur<00:00:28.260> and

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
here is taken an ordinary derailleur and

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.490 
here is taken an ordinary derailleur and
put<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.490> radio-controlled<00:00:30.029> servo<00:00:30.990> inside<00:00:31.320> it

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
put a radio-controlled servo inside it

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.470 
put a radio-controlled servo inside it
so<00:00:31.650> there<00:00:31.800> are<00:00:31.859> no<00:00:31.980> no<00:00:32.669> cables<00:00:33.120> anymore

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
so there are no no cables anymore

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.270 
so there are no no cables anymore
attaching<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.230> derailleur<00:00:34.559> instead<00:00:35.100> the

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
attaching to the derailleur instead the

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.869 
attaching to the derailleur instead the
shifting<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:35.760> done<00:00:36.030> by<00:00:36.329> this<00:00:37.010> cable<00:00:38.010> set<00:00:38.760> of

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
shifting is done by this cable set of

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:47.810 
shifting is done by this cable set of
wires<00:00:45.559> alright<00:00:46.559> so<00:00:46.890> in<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.219> back<00:00:47.370> here<00:00:47.399> we

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
wires alright so in the back here we

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.319 
wires alright so in the back here we
have<00:00:48.030> two<00:00:49.020> 12-volt<00:00:49.770> lead<00:00:49.980> acid<00:00:50.340> batteries<00:00:50.820> off

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
have two 12-volt lead acid batteries off

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.860 
have two 12-volt lead acid batteries off

big hunk of aluminum as a heatsink that

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.870 
big hunk of aluminum as a heatsink that
feeds<00:00:58.350> five<00:00:58.649> volts<00:00:59.070> -<00:01:00.859> yes<00:01:01.859> you<00:01:02.190> guessed<00:01:02.460> an

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:04.880

feeds five volts - yes you guessed an
Arduino<00:01:06.140> microcontroller<00:01:07.580> which<00:01:08.580> is

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
Arduino microcontroller which is

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.429 
Arduino microcontroller which is
programmed<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.450> put<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.900> servo<00:01:10.229> in<00:01:10.409> the

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
programmed to put the servo in the

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.310 
programmed to put the servo in the
appropriate<00:01:11.010> position<00:01:11.430> on<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.840> handlebars

we<00:01:13.860> have<00:01:14.780> two<00:01:15.780> push<00:01:15.990> buttons<00:01:16.020> attached<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.890> a

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
we have two push buttons attached to a

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.730 
we have two push buttons attached to a
little<00:01:17.159> piece<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.340> circuit<00:01:17.820> board<00:01:18.259> one<00:01:19.259> shifts

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
little piece of circuit board one shifts

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.620 
little piece of circuit board one shifts
to<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.100> lower<00:01:20.400> gear<00:01:20.640> one<00:01:20.970> shifts<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.420> higher

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
to a lower gear one shifts to a higher

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.719 
to a lower gear one shifts to a higher
year<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.110> also<00:01:22.229> remembers<00:01:22.950> where<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.280> was<00:01:23.460> last

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
year it also remembers where it was last

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.550 
year it also remembers where it was last
time<00:01:23.970> so<00:01:24.299> when<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.540> shut<00:01:24.780> down<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.110> power<00:01:25.140> and

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
time so when you shut down the power and

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.330 
time so when you shut down the power and
start<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:25.920> up<00:01:26.009> again

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
start it up again

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.969 
start it up again
that<00:01:26.909> derailleur<00:01:27.299> doesn't<00:01:27.720> go<00:01:27.840> go<00:01:28.439> moving<00:01:28.799> on

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
that derailleur doesn't go go moving on

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.069 
that derailleur doesn't go go moving on
you<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.549> cable<00:01:29.939> that's<00:01:30.150> normally<00:01:30.630> coming<00:01:30.960> out

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
you the cable that's normally coming out

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
of this index shifter here is gone that

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.539 
of this index shifter here is gone that
is<00:01:36.140> that<00:01:37.140> is<00:01:37.350> we<00:01:37.680> have<00:01:37.860> no<00:01:38.009> mechanical

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
is that is we have no mechanical
