00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.560
 from today the balm is not used anymore 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:09.480
 just to smooth the hair but that 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.630
 gray auction day that does not end 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.150
 never in paper pencil scissors we color the 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.460
 we already have some with the color bearer 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.779
 eyeshadow on the races look how many are 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:25.220
 friends who meet on one side lose 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:28.220
 this is art for you 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.220
 Article 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:35.020
 Hello everyone and welcome by his eyeshadow 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.480
 art for you today a new episode on 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.730
 polymer clay will do together 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.780
 balsam paste or rather my recipe 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:46.059
 of pasta dough a dough made 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.770
 taking advantage of the emollient properties of 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:51.040
 balm especially those that 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:53.260
 they contain petrolatum in fact this is a 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.760
 nice way to recycle the balm that 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.100
 maybe we don't want to put it in our heads anymore 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.220
 because for example in my case I don't use 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:04.449
 more petroleum jelly and therefore there is 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:06.100
 there remained the fine half-lump 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.440
 let's use it to create a paste 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.740
 modeling really really pretty 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.360
 easy to do and above all beautiful from 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.070
 shaping let's move on the work surface 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.290
 let's see what I've done 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.080
 and here is the stuff to prepare the 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.540
 our dough of the first raise a 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.009
 hair conditioner one of those 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.830
 we want to stop because it is not there 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:30.160
 particularly liked 125 g of 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:34.090
 hair conditioner 70 grams of starch 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:38.950
 corn or cornstarch is the same thing is 80 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:40.750
 g of flour 00 30 ml of oil of 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.300
 Vaseline you can also use oil 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.700
 johnson or even a seed oil that 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.979
 have this color quite clear 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.380
 pasta can be colored both while the 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.240
 it prepares itself that immediately afterwards in the sense 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.759
 if necessary taking the small ones 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.250
 pats and coloring them with color 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:59.590
 acrylic in that dye cord 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.780
 food or with what most dante 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.170
 of the watercolor in the tube 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.390
 the important thing is that you replenish the part 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.700
 while virulent if it becomes too liquid 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.740
 with some flour or another 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.940
 little bit of dress we immediately start the 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:18.670
 our preparation 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:22.990
 immediately put the 30 grams of oil 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:25.620
 ok I put 31 in it the 125's do nothing 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.620
 balm 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.560
 here we are and we give a first of 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:36.000
 mixed with the parts 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.890
 so if we want color it helps the pasta 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.430
 and at this point we should say the 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.440
 color 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.360
 I prefer to speak color instead 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.730
 natural and then color it if necessary 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.040
 when I will use pasta 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.690
 as I will certainly do it with you 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:53.099
 we will see one of the next videos 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:54.590
 together we now pay 70 grams of 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:03:00.360
 cornstarch 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:02.489
 ok and the 80 of flour 00 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.830
 at this point there is nothing left but 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.650
 stir everything well and do it 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.790
 become the compound a beautiful pasta 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.160
 soft 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.650
 mix stir stir until 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.290
 everything will not be incorporated and when it will be 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:19.739
 difficult to incorporate with the handle of the 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:22.319
 our ladle of our cutlery by 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.830
 at that point we pour the wood on the plane 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:27.630
 of work and knead manually 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:31.709
 adding a mix from time to time 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:34.230
 made from a tablespoon of starch is a 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.480
 spoonful of flour mixed together 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.820
 this will serve us to give body to the 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.769
 Our dough we continue to add 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.500
 matter because this may depend 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:45.739
 much from the reverse market degree 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:51.959
 moisture of the balm we use 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:56.000
 so this is the basic recipe then a 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:58.350
 depending on how liquid a conditioner is 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.780
 one can see forced to 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.430
 reach in percentage in that case 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.250
 always add a tablespoon of starch 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:08.030
 it is a spoonful of perfect flour 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:11.040
 you will see when the mixture begins to 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:14.459
 to break means that it is ready for 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:17.729
 to be worked and then take it with 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:21.630
 hands and very soft of course is a 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:24.539
 very fragrant and then as before 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:27.020
 let's proceed gradually adding 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:27.020
 flour 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:34.850
 and starch in the quantity of a spoon e 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:38.090
 a perfect spoon let's get dirty 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:43.300
 we too dust hands so it will be more 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:46.250
 easy to stay less and incorporate 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:48.650
 until the dough is elastic 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:52.400
 soft but not too sticky anymore 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:55.370
 to the elite to this very soft dough 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:58.160
 air dry therefore suitable for 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:01.700
 children's creativity also suitable for 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:07.850
 small objects for wedding favors is a pasta 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:12.140
 very fine as a very soft texture of 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:15.140
 a good duration is certainly not successful 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:18.110
 undergoes a lot of withdrawal a little yes but 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:20.240
 not much and if done by maintaining a 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:23.270
 the right degree of humidity is difficult 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:25.760
 really really hard splits 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.890
 this is thinner than salt dough 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.640
 and less subtle than rice pasta e 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:33.620
 cornmeal but easier 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:36.890
 creation if I have to be honest and also 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:40.210
 more pleasant to the touch and smell 

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:43.280
 because it is perfumed it is preserved in 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:46.729
 refrigerator wrapped in cellophane 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:49.280
 I also have a dry place always 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:51.470
 wrapped in non -direct cellophane 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.870
 contact with light 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:55.460
 here I leave the direct link to the playlist 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:57.590
 where you will find all the pastries 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.150
 which we have modeled on others 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:01.070
 start because I'm really really 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.720
 we have so many modeling pastes 

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.580
 done together by clicking here you will find them 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:07.460
 all the sun we color together a 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:13.220
 piece put some friends or some 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:14.990
 flour on the work surface to make 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:18.620
 absorb the moisture that I am now going to 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:25.570
 leeds innovate I put some color in the 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:25.570
 center and began to knead 

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:43.889
 and here is our beautiful pasta e 

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:45.389
 colorful look at that beautiful pink texture 

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:48.210
 soft soft 

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:50.370
 if you have to make flat creations 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:53.250
 it's fine to use it so soft if 

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:55.409
 you have to make puppets made before 

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:57.090
 various pieces left iraq take e 

00:06:55.409 --> 00:07:00.210
 then join them by wetting them with 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:03.090
 water the glue contained in the mido di 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:06.030
 maize will help keep the people together 

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:08.069
 several small pieces and here is the 

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:08.729
 Few pasta ready to boast 

00:07:08.069 --> 00:07:10.500
 instants 

00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:12.479
 we press again a little something on TV 

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:16.680
 since this pasta from Balzamo is beautiful 

00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:18.810
 it is a very very pretty versatile pasta 

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:21.629
 that if you call it then it has easily 

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:23.460
 sic skilled with which you can do 2000 things 

00:07:21.629 --> 00:07:25.770
 both you and your children because it is 

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:28.169
 a pa because it is a lot of pasta too 

00:07:25.770 --> 00:07:29.789
 suitable for the little ones of course it is not 

00:07:28.169 --> 00:07:31.620
 of bill and therefore if you stay with the children 

00:07:29.789 --> 00:07:33.930
 be careful that you don't eat it and 

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:36.210

 in the nose in the ears always 

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:40.229
 be careful with modeling pastes and children 

00:07:38.279 --> 00:07:41.759
