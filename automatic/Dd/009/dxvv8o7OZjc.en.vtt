00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.669
 so while waiting for the test of the gopro 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.869
 heroes 3 black edition I'm in 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:26.820
 train to test but the test is a 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.680
 little bit long to do I tested a 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.220
 small application quickly for 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.169
 very small 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.790
 I thank husband for indicating this 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:34.890
 application this app will yield 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.080
 nimol and we'll see right away if the 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.339
 animals can learn the alphabet to 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.570
 our children 

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:41.570
 in this test 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.940
 the order we immolate actually is a 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:51.200
 abecedary an alphabet with which one 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.060
 will be able to draw 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.380
 so when you open a letter he 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.000
 tells you and that's why I 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.360
 put the ipad on a large sheet of 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.580
 paper 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.110
 it tells you a drawing that you need 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.260
 do next to the ipad 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.059
 so take a marker if possible not 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.880
 permanent to not damage the hull of 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.590
 your ipad or iphone and makes you the 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.180
 drawing that tell you to do so 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:14.240
 as you see I also draw 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.700
 like a three-year-old here we are 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.600
 do the drawing and then we trigger 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.550
 the animal a cane alligators and in 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.960
 clicking on the alligator we have a small 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:29.600
 simple animation so that's the child 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.530
 after can continue to draw around 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.440
 ipad 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.649
 you want to do a complete alligator is going 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.720
 test another letter the b so we're going 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:39.710
 to change sheets of paper is for 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.660
 that by the way if you do not want 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.450
 shoot too much paper play with the 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:47.360
 iphone version it can do that on 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.310
 a notebook maybe smaller so there 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.100
 I'm trying to draw what 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.659
 request to do and of course that does not 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.229
 looks like nothing but we will say that 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.630
 it succeeded 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:00.470
 and then we trigger the little girl 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.460
 on a whale and that's small 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.900
 funny animations 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.060
 what's nice is that he does not have 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.850
 searched for the developer either then 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.160
 that the cries of animals but more 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.510
 tolerant nice and really what is 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.220
 very very nice at the graphic level 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:18.110
 it is used all the surface 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:20.360
 of the ipad for to draw the animal the 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.480
 symbolize so the animal becomes 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.220
 really almost a toy in its own right 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.700
 there for example we will do so know 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.989
 and you will see as schaaf 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.540
 he is too cute the animate of the cat is 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.310
 really too cute well and that's it and 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.170
 your child can continue to draw 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:37.700
 draw the cat's tail the time of 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.220
 shah around the ipad 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.410
 so it really allows him to have fun 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.560
 letters around long enough and 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.060
 spend a good afternoon with him 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.950
 the app can be fun for 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.989
 less young who are in the process 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.480
 to learn languages from other languages 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.520
 since the app exists in four languages 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.660
 for now in English in Spanish in 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.170
 French and German 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:05.090
 so we will try logis in spanish 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:08.360
 palawan rattan and hawla wa i have not 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.700

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.950
 has the small to nimes of the jaguar so well 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.790
 sure according to the letters the animals change 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.220
 his name but languages 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:20.420
 we will do a little test in German 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:29.090
 art so we'll see what gives the 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:34.220
 letter f in German fx and firefox 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:35.810
 because here for the - small it can 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.390
 to be nice actually for the 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.110

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:41.690

 educational ludo with your child is 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.370
 this app has been developed 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.260
 by a dad and he explains a little bit 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.820
 his story in about 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.110
 so I invite you to go a little 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.880
 the story because the idea is him 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:29.360
 came playing with his daughter with a 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.440
 alphabet and origamis so we feel 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.610
 really that it's an app is 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.000

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.400
 find perfect 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.760
 it's an excellent use of the 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.340
 surface of a touch surface and 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.880
 I hope like release version

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.860
 even nice to watch because the 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:06.790
 graphic finds are really 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:12.290
 well the colors are bright the design 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:15.110
 and finally simple without being simplistic anymore 

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:17.150
 early and we can really spent a good 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.430
 life with his child to learn the 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.770
