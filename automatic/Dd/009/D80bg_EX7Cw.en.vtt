in this venue a in the in the UAE before

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.510 
in this venue a in the in the UAE before
so<00:01:07.049> I<00:01:07.080> mean<00:01:07.170> these<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:08.010> know<00:01:08.070> they're<00:01:08.189> not<00:01:08.310> bad

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
so I mean these you know they're not bad

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.370 
so I mean these you know they're not bad
players<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.240> when<00:01:09.689> we<00:01:09.810> when<00:01:10.049> we're<00:01:10.170> talking

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
players and when we when we're talking

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.830 
players and when we when we're talking
at<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.310> break<00:01:11.520> about<00:01:11.729> Miz<00:01:12.090> bar<00:01:12.270> being<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.659> key

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
at the break about Miz bar being the key

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.499 
at the break about Miz bar being the key
we<00:01:13.229> were<00:01:13.439> I<00:01:13.710> suppose<00:01:14.400> slightly<00:01:15.330> under

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
we were I suppose slightly under

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.179 
we were I suppose slightly under
estimating<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.170> potential<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.619> these<00:01:16.680> two<00:01:16.890> I

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
estimating the potential of these two I

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.420 
estimating the potential of these two I
think<00:01:17.729> we<00:01:17.850> did<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.530> they've<00:01:19.530> kept<00:01:19.860> things<00:01:20.130> so

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
think we did and they've kept things so

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.020 
think we did and they've kept things so
simple

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
simple

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.310

there<00:01:21.659> hasn't<00:01:21.810> been<00:01:21.990> very<00:01:22.290> much

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
there hasn't been very much

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.550 
there hasn't been very much

review Billy Bowden thought long and
hard<00:02:33.299> for<00:02:33.720> about<00:02:34.080> 90<00:02:34.799> seconds<00:02:35.310> as<00:02:35.519> to<00:02:35.760> whether

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
hard for about 90 seconds as to whether

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.220 
hard for about 90 seconds as to whether
the<00:02:36.989> ball<00:02:37.670> you<00:02:38.670> know<00:02:38.730> that<00:02:39.060> touched<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.630> bat

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
the ball you know that touched the bat

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.900 
the ball you know that touched the bat
on<00:02:40.440> its<00:02:40.590> way<00:02:40.769> through<00:02:41.069> to<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:41.340> pad<00:02:41.610> but<00:02:41.819> I

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
on its way through to the pad but I

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.660 
on its way through to the pad but I
think<00:02:42.150> he<00:02:42.209> got<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:42.569> decision<00:02:43.160> correct<00:02:44.160> and

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:56.020 

-<00:02:47.270> had<00:02:48.110> hopes<00:02:48.350> of

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.640 

the<00:02:57.030> they're<00:02:57.660> gonna<00:02:57.750> have<00:02:57.900> to<00:02:57.990> be

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
the they're gonna have to be

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.949 
the they're gonna have to be
because<00:02:59.129> the<00:02:59.310> new<00:02:59.730> ball<00:03:00.000> is<00:03:00.269> a<00:03:00.299> long<00:03:00.629> way<00:03:00.810> away

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
because the new ball is a long way away

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.860 
because the new ball is a long way away
still<00:03:01.530> they're<00:03:02.159> going<00:03:02.340> to<00:03:02.430> have<00:03:02.610> to<00:03:02.840> you<00:03:03.840> know

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
still they're going to have to you know

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.160 
still they're going to have to you know
set<00:03:04.489> sensible<00:03:05.489> fields<00:03:06.030> tomorrow<00:03:06.780> morning

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
set sensible fields tomorrow morning

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.350 
set sensible fields tomorrow morning
until<00:03:07.560> they<00:03:07.920> break<00:03:08.159> this<00:03:08.400> partnership<00:03:09.120> it

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
until they break this partnership it

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.050 
until they break this partnership it
would<00:03:09.480> appear<00:03:09.780> to<00:03:09.810> me<00:03:09.959> that<00:03:10.670> the<00:03:11.670> older<00:03:12.030> the

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
would appear to me that the older the

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.210 
would appear to me that the older the
ball<00:03:12.330> gets<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:13.230> less<00:03:13.470> it<00:03:13.650> does<00:03:13.860> for<00:03:14.129> the

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
ball gets the less it does for the

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.089 
ball gets the less it does for the
spinner<00:03:14.580> so<00:03:15.079> in<00:03:16.079> England<00:03:16.680> they're<00:03:16.829> gonna<00:03:16.920> have

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
spinner so in England they're gonna have

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:19.280 
spinner so in England they're gonna have
to<00:03:17.129> work<00:03:17.340> hard<00:03:17.700> to<00:03:17.849> level<00:03:18.480> this<00:03:18.720> series<00:03:19.079> yeah

what that lead is although Michael Aston

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:12.129 
what that lead is although Michael Aston
was<00:05:10.500> making<00:05:10.890> the<00:05:11.010> point

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:12.139 
was making the point

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:14.170 
was making the point
that<00:05:12.409> in<00:05:12.650> modern<00:05:13.009> test<00:05:13.310> cricket<00:05:13.610> with<00:05:13.999> all

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
that in modern test cricket with all

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.809 
that in modern test cricket with all
these<00:05:14.389> changes<00:05:14.659> it<00:05:15.050> would<00:05:15.259> appear<00:05:15.830> that<00:05:16.159> it's

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:16.819 
these changes it would appear that it's

00:05:16.819 --> 00:05:18.760 
these changes it would appear that it's
becoming<00:05:17.240> easier<00:05:17.539> to<00:05:18.050> bat<00:05:18.259> in<00:05:18.409> the<00:05:18.439> fourth

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
becoming easier to bat in the fourth

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.429 
becoming easier to bat in the fourth
innings<00:05:19.219> and<00:05:19.460> it<00:05:19.610> used<00:05:19.849> to<00:05:19.999> be<00:05:20.270> and<00:05:20.930> more<00:05:21.139> size

00:05:21.429 --> 00:05:21.439 
innings and it used to be and more size

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:24.100 
innings and it used to be and more size
of<00:05:21.680> winning<00:05:22.009> batting<00:05:22.460> last<00:05:22.729> but<00:05:23.150> when<00:05:23.960> you've

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
of winning batting last but when you've

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.679 
of winning batting last but when you've
seen<00:05:24.349> the<00:05:24.529> ball<00:05:24.710> behave<00:05:25.129> as<00:05:25.999> it<00:05:26.150> has<00:05:26.300> done<00:05:26.539> on

00:05:26.679 --> 00:05:26.689 
seen the ball behave as it has done on

00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:28.570 
seen the ball behave as it has done on
occasions<00:05:27.349> in<00:05:27.499> this<00:05:27.680> match<00:05:27.979> you<00:05:28.279> wouldn't

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
occasions in this match you wouldn't

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.999 
occasions in this match you wouldn't
want<00:05:28.729> to<00:05:28.789> be<00:05:28.909> chasing<00:05:29.240> ideally<00:05:30.199> many<00:05:30.800> more

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:31.009 
want to be chasing ideally many more

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:33.550 
want to be chasing ideally many more
than<00:05:31.159> 150<00:05:31.969> yeah<00:05:32.479> I<00:05:32.509> mean<00:05:32.810> maybe<00:05:33.020> a<00:05:33.110> few<00:05:33.379> more

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
than 150 yeah I mean maybe a few more

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.570 
than 150 yeah I mean maybe a few more
yeah<00:05:34.430> up<00:05:34.639> to<00:05:34.789> 200<00:05:35.479> above<00:05:36.139> 200<00:05:36.860> you're<00:05:37.069> starting

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
yeah up to 200 above 200 you're starting

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.820 
yeah up to 200 above 200 you're starting
to<00:05:38.330> think<00:05:38.539> actually<00:05:38.659> now<00:05:38.930> this<00:05:39.080> could<00:05:39.229> be<00:05:39.289> the

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
to think actually now this could be the

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:41.439 
to think actually now this could be the
tricky<00:05:40.189> so<00:05:40.370> okay<00:05:40.580> let's<00:05:41.060> worry<00:05:41.240> about<00:05:41.300> that

00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:41.449 
tricky so okay let's worry about that

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:45.040 
tricky so okay let's worry about that
tomorrow<00:05:41.860> a<00:05:42.860> couple<00:05:43.189> of<00:05:43.279> half<00:05:43.400> chances<00:05:44.050> that

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
tomorrow a couple of half chances that

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.749 
tomorrow a couple of half chances that
England<00:05:45.379> missed<00:05:45.590> in<00:05:45.830> his<00:05:45.949> final<00:05:46.310> session<00:05:46.639> one

00:05:46.749 --> 00:05:46.759 
England missed in his final session one

00:05:46.759 --> 00:05:48.369 
England missed in his final session one
or<00:05:46.849> two<00:05:46.969> close<00:05:47.210> call<00:05:47.479> solutions<00:05:48.110> show<00:05:48.319> you

00:05:48.369 --> 00:05:48.379 
or two close call solutions show you

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:52.469 
or two close call solutions show you
here<00:05:49.689> Peterson<00:05:50.689> he<00:05:50.810> had<00:05:50.930> a<00:05:50.960> clear<00:05:51.319> chance

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:52.479 
here Peterson he had a clear chance

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:54.670 
here Peterson he had a clear chance
didn't<00:05:53.479> miss<00:05:53.569> by<00:05:53.599> much<00:05:53.750> no<00:05:54.319> you<00:05:54.379> would<00:05:54.650> have

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.680 
didn't miss by much no you would have

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.980 
didn't miss by much no you would have
backed<00:05:54.860> him<00:05:55.069> five<00:05:55.819> six<00:05:56.150> yards<00:05:56.449> who<00:05:56.509> will<00:05:56.659> three

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:56.990 
backed him five six yards who will three

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.140 
backed him five six yards who will three
stumps<00:05:57.259> to<00:05:57.289> hit<00:05:57.529> he<00:05:58.129> was<00:05:58.189> very<00:05:58.430> very<00:05:58.639> quick<00:05:58.969> on

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.150 
stumps to hit he was very very quick on

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.290 
stumps to hit he was very very quick on
the<00:05:59.680> to<00:06:00.680> stop<00:06:00.889> the<00:06:01.009> single<00:06:01.370> you<00:06:01.969> might<00:06:02.090> got<00:06:02.270> a

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:02.300 
the to stop the single you might got a

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.399 
the to stop the single you might got a
yellow<00:06:02.449> card<00:06:02.719> for<00:06:02.779> the<00:06:02.960> dive<00:06:04.210> he<00:06:05.210> he<00:06:06.020> was<00:06:06.229> good

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:06.409 
yellow card for the dive he he was good

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:09.309 
yellow card for the dive he he was good
but<00:06:06.589> gnarly<00:06:07.069> that's<00:06:07.870> can<00:06:08.870> you<00:06:08.960> call<00:06:09.139> that<00:06:09.289> a

00:06:09.309 --> 00:06:09.319 
but gnarly that's can you call that a

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:12.399 
but gnarly that's can you call that a
half<00:06:09.469> chance<00:06:09.830> well<00:06:10.759> no<00:06:11.419> that's<00:06:11.870> that's<00:06:12.199> tough

00:06:12.399 --> 00:06:12.409 
half chance well no that's that's tough

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:14.739 
half chance well no that's that's tough
that<00:06:12.650> I<00:06:12.889> mean<00:06:13.189> if<00:06:13.279> it's<00:06:13.849> face<00:06:14.089> to<00:06:14.270> the<00:06:14.360> bat<00:06:14.539> if

00:06:14.739 --> 00:06:14.749 
that I mean if it's face to the bat if

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:15.939 
that I mean if it's face to the bat if
it's<00:06:14.900> a<00:06:14.960> pushed<00:06:15.169> hard<00:06:15.379> at<00:06:15.529> you're<00:06:15.650> a<00:06:15.680> short

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:15.949 
it's a pushed hard at you're a short

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:17.260 
it's a pushed hard at you're a short
laying<00:06:16.159> into<00:06:16.370> you<00:06:16.490> you<00:06:16.849> know<00:06:16.969> three<00:06:17.240> four

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:17.270 
laying into you you know three four

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:18.939 
laying into you you know three four
yards<00:06:17.750> away<00:06:17.839> and<00:06:18.169> he's<00:06:18.349> one<00:06:18.469> of<00:06:18.500> the<00:06:18.620> best<00:06:18.800> in

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:18.949 
yards away and he's one of the best in

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:21.189 
yards away and he's one of the best in
the<00:06:19.039> business<00:06:19.219> as<00:06:19.490> well<00:06:19.669> so<00:06:19.939> it's<00:06:20.330> now<00:06:20.960> that's

00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:21.199 
the business as well so it's now that's

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:23.019 
the business as well so it's now that's
that's<00:06:21.529> a<00:06:21.650> tough<00:06:21.860> chance<00:06:22.099> but<00:06:22.370> I<00:06:22.610> think<00:06:22.969> the

00:06:23.019 --> 00:06:23.029 
that's a tough chance but I think the

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:25.089 
that's a tough chance but I think the
Peterson<00:06:23.419> one<00:06:23.599> was<00:06:23.839> a<00:06:23.870> more<00:06:24.740> than<00:06:24.770> a<00:06:24.949> half

00:06:25.089 --> 00:06:25.099 
Peterson one was a more than a half

00:06:25.099 --> 00:06:27.429 
Peterson one was a more than a half
chance<00:06:25.430> because<00:06:25.610> my<00:06:25.849> loss<00:06:26.120> he<00:06:26.270> was<00:06:26.419> but<00:06:26.659> and

00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:27.439 
chance because my loss he was but and

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:28.990 
chance because my loss he was but and
the<00:06:27.560> some<00:06:28.129> of<00:06:28.159> them<00:06:28.279> things<00:06:28.580> if<00:06:28.699> his<00:06:28.789> things

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.000 
the some of them things if his things

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.429 
the some of them things if his things
are<00:06:29.120> going<00:06:29.300> for<00:06:29.539> you<00:06:29.629> and<00:06:29.750> the<00:06:30.110> two<00:06:30.259> young

00:06:30.429 --> 00:06:30.439 
are going for you and the two young

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:32.619 
are going for you and the two young

00:06:32.619 --> 00:06:32.629 
batsmen were going well that's a bit of

00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:34.089 
batsmen were going well that's a bit of
