00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
sounding boost pedal kind of adds a

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.680 
sounding boost pedal kind of adds a
little<00:01:05.979> bit<00:01:06.100> of<00:01:06.280> a<00:01:06.400> almost<00:01:06.700> magic<00:01:07.210> to<00:01:07.360> the<00:01:07.479> tone

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
it sounds really cool I really like sort

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.830 
it sounds really cool I really like sort
of<00:01:11.860> the<00:01:11.979> characteristics<00:01:12.670> or<00:01:12.790> natural<00:01:13.450> sort

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
of sound of it and what it does

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.480 
of sound of it and what it does
very<00:01:16.899> quickly<00:01:17.170> GHS<00:01:17.770> has<00:01:17.950> added<00:01:18.190> some<00:01:18.310> neat

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
very quickly GHS has added some neat

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.040 
very quickly GHS has added some neat
features<00:01:18.820> so<00:01:18.940> when<00:01:19.060> you<00:01:19.149> turn<00:01:19.240> the<00:01:19.390> pedal<00:01:19.659> all

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.050 
features so when you turn the pedal all

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.080 
features so when you turn the pedal all
the<00:01:20.380> way<00:01:20.500> the<00:01:21.070> knob<00:01:21.220> all<00:01:21.460> the<00:01:21.490> way<00:01:21.640> back<00:01:21.820> it

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
the way the knob all the way back it

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.910 
the way the knob all the way back it
really<00:01:22.390> is<00:01:22.540> just<00:01:22.570> a<00:01:22.899> buffer<00:01:23.200> in<00:01:23.380> that<00:01:23.590> mode<00:01:23.770> it

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
really is just a buffer in that mode it

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.530 
really is just a buffer in that mode it
doesn't<00:01:24.159> totally<00:01:24.280> cut<00:01:24.610> your<00:01:24.729> signal<00:01:24.880> it<00:01:25.360> just

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
doesn't totally cut your signal it just

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:26.700 
doesn't totally cut your signal it just
goes<00:01:25.659> into<00:01:25.810> a<00:01:25.899> buffer<00:01:26.110> mode<00:01:26.380> where<00:01:26.619> it's

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
goes into a buffer mode where it's

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.779 
goes into a buffer mode where it's
really<00:01:26.890> not<00:01:27.630> boosting<00:01:28.630> anything<00:01:29.020> but<00:01:29.860> it<00:01:30.549> just

00:01:30.779 --> 00:01:30.789 
really not boosting anything but it just

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:33.859 
really not boosting anything but it just
sort<00:01:31.000> of<00:01:31.060> 1st<00:01:31.750> 25%<00:01:32.530> is<00:01:32.649> a<00:01:32.770> slight<00:01:33.130> volume<00:01:33.610> boost

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
sort of 1st 25% is a slight volume boost

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.389 
sort of 1st 25% is a slight volume boost
capabilities<00:01:34.869> and<00:01:35.050> a<00:01:35.170> buffer<00:01:35.500> mode<00:01:35.710> and<00:01:35.950> you

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
capabilities and a buffer mode and you

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:37.740 
capabilities and a buffer mode and you
would<00:01:36.520> want<00:01:36.729> a<00:01:36.880> buffer<00:01:37.210> on<00:01:37.240> your<00:01:37.479> pedal<00:01:37.720> board

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
would want a buffer on your pedal board

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.600 
would want a buffer on your pedal board
if<00:01:37.990> you<00:01:38.080> have<00:01:38.229> a<00:01:38.259> lot<00:01:38.500> of<00:01:38.530> true-bypass<00:01:38.950> pedals

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
if you have a lot of true-bypass pedals

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.219 
if you have a lot of true-bypass pedals
and<00:01:39.759> you're<00:01:40.360> losing<00:01:40.720> a<00:01:40.780> little<00:01:40.899> bit<00:01:40.990> of<00:01:41.080> your

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
and you're losing a little bit of your

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:44.520 
and you're losing a little bit of your
high-end<00:01:41.590> guitar<00:01:41.950> tone<00:01:42.159> or<00:01:42.460> if<00:01:43.149> you<00:01:43.600> are

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
high-end guitar tone or if you are

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:46.320 
high-end guitar tone or if you are
really<00:01:44.860> going<00:01:44.979> to<00:01:45.039> be<00:01:45.159> running<00:01:45.460> a<00:01:45.550> long<00:01:45.819> cable

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
really going to be running a long cable

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:47.490 
really going to be running a long cable
from<00:01:46.479> your<00:01:46.539> pedal<00:01:46.929> board<00:01:46.960> to<00:01:47.229> your<00:01:47.380> amplifier

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
from your pedal board to your amplifier

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.370 
from your pedal board to your amplifier
it's<00:01:47.979> good<00:01:48.159> to<00:01:48.250> have<00:01:48.340> a<00:01:48.369> strong<00:01:49.259> signal<00:01:50.259> and

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
it's good to have a strong signal and

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.270 
it's good to have a strong signal and
the<00:01:51.360> buffer<00:01:52.360> capabilities<00:01:53.140> in<00:01:53.350> the<00:01:53.830> prestige

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
the buffer capabilities in the prestige

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.279 
the buffer capabilities in the prestige
are<00:01:54.520> great<00:01:54.819> for<00:01:54.970> that<00:01:55.090> and<00:01:55.240> that<00:01:55.330> first<00:01:55.509> 25%

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:56.289 
are great for that and that first 25%

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:58.800 
are great for that and that first 25%
then<00:01:57.280> when<00:01:57.429> we<00:01:57.550> get<00:01:57.729> into<00:01:57.850> this<00:01:58.060> range<00:01:58.390> here

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
then when we get into this range here

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.559 
then when we get into this range here
really<00:01:59.530> it<00:01:59.770> is<00:02:00.399> a<00:02:00.429> dynamic<00:02:01.030> sort<00:02:01.149> of<00:02:01.300> powerful

00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:01.569 
really it is a dynamic sort of powerful

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:04.560 
really it is a dynamic sort of powerful
boost<00:02:01.929> pedal<00:02:02.170> we<00:02:02.440> started<00:02:03.090> right<00:02:04.090> there<00:02:04.119> and

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
boost pedal we started right there and

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.719 
boost pedal we started right there and
so<00:02:05.409> let's<00:02:05.590> just<00:02:05.649> go<00:02:05.890> over<00:02:05.920> here<00:02:06.100> and<00:02:06.369> we'll

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
so let's just go over here and we'll

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.030 
so let's just go over here and we'll
show<00:02:06.939> you<00:02:06.969> how<00:02:07.119> it<00:02:07.360> kind<00:02:07.750> of<00:02:07.810> adds<00:02:08.709> something

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.040 
show you how it kind of adds something

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.610 
show you how it kind of adds something
to<00:02:09.250> your<00:02:09.369> guitar<00:02:09.700> and<00:02:10.000> amp<00:02:10.329> tone<00:02:10.630> and<00:02:10.929> just

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
to your guitar and amp tone and just

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.170 
to your guitar and amp tone and just
really<00:02:11.890> makes<00:02:12.070> it<00:02:12.220> sort<00:02:12.489> of<00:02:12.579> sparkle<00:02:13.030> and

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
really makes it sort of sparkle and

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.560 
really makes it sort of sparkle and
shine<00:02:13.450> and<00:02:15.150> sort<00:02:16.150> of<00:02:16.209> gives<00:02:16.420> you<00:02:16.540> some

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
shine and sort of gives you some

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.990 
shine and sort of gives you some
definition<00:02:17.290> and<00:02:17.530> some<00:02:17.650> clarity<00:02:18.100> and<00:02:18.250> pushes

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
definition and some clarity and pushes

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:57.120 
definition and some clarity and pushes
an<00:02:19.090> amp<00:02:19.269> really<00:02:19.540> well<00:02:19.690> too<00:02:19.870> so

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.670 

so<00:02:58.130> now<00:02:58.970> let's<00:02:59.300> just<00:02:59.420> push<00:02:59.780> it<00:02:59.960> a<00:03:00.050> little<00:03:00.470> bit

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
so now let's just push it a little bit

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.270 
so now let's just push it a little bit
