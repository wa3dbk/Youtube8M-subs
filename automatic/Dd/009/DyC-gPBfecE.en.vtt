00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:30.060
 Welcome to this new program about 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:32.779
 games and applications for android pc and 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.779
 God 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.820
 in this first program we will talk about 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.360
 guaiparo more 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:46.580
 the game for them universal is 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:49.270
 incompatible with those that is not yet 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.270
 available for android 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.380
 although there is a free version of 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.850
 same in our case we will analyze your 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.750
 paid version 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.430
 of course, it has options that 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.010
 are not available in the 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.870
 free version 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:11.540
 anyway its price is very low 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:13.700
 only 179 euros 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.720
 now it turns out to be pretty low for the 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:19.510
 quality of the latter 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.030
 our objective will be to pilot a 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:25.210
 trial motorcycle and we will have to 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.080
 get to finish each of the 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.860
 numerous tracks 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:34.340
 they will increase their difficulty until 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:37.520
 get to some that will require that 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:42.070
 Squeeze our skill to the maximum 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.070
 and skill to overcome them 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.390
 there are some control points that we 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.790
 will allow to continue from the last one that 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.010
 we have overcome if we have a 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.910
 accident 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:58.840
 at the end of a canal we will be given 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:02:01.630
 a two or three stars the first by 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.840
 finish the phase the second one if we have not 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.880
 finished in a time less than 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:10.030
 predetermined and the third to have 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:12.880
 collected all the coins that appear 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.900
 during the tour these stars 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:22.870
 will be necessary to unlock 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:25.000
 more advanced levels also if we 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:28.240
 we tire of the clues that bring the 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.290
 game we can always use the 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:34.480
 magnificent editor that accompanies and with the 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.200
 that we can make our own 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:41.260
 circuits with great ease the 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.510
 options when designing are more 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:45.790
 enough and it is very 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.860
 entertaining build and try up 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:52.840
 get the clue to our 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.780
 as for the quality of this game 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:59.950
 we can simply describe it as 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.240
 excellent since its 3d graphics are 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.820
 very good 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:07.410
 the sound accompanies very well and the most 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:10.600
 important its playability is devilish 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:13.180
 thanks mostly to a very controls 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:16.600
 well implemented already a physics 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:27.480
 realistic but adjusted to an arcade game 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:31.000
 as is the case once installed it occupies 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.340
 149 megs although the installer that 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.420
 we will have to download from the app store 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:40.030
 it does not reach 50 megabytes this data is very 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.530
 important because it will depend on the 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.950
 number of applications that we can 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:47.440
 install on our device is not 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.570
 Too much if we compare it with others 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:54.120
 titles that even multiply 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:54.120
 by 10 this amount 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:04.290
 we have reached the end of this little 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:08.600
 analysis and it only remains to give you my verdict 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:15.500
 final my score for danced is from 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:15.500
 8 points out of 10 that is a remarkable high
