you're looking at this video and it has
to<00:00:13.650> do<00:00:13.769> with<00:00:13.799> the<00:00:14.730> shifter<00:00:15.570> cable<00:00:15.900> to<00:00:16.590> replace

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
to do with the shifter cable to replace

to do with the shifter cable to replace
it

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
it

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.939 
it
while<00:00:17.850> some<00:00:18.119> I<00:00:18.150> was<00:00:18.359> quoted<00:00:18.750> was<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.260> hard<00:00:19.560> 78

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
while some I was quoted was a hard 78

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.029 
while some I was quoted was a hard 78
bucks<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.539> the<00:00:21.539> reason<00:00:21.840> being<00:00:21.960> is<00:00:22.230> there<00:00:22.859> are

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
bucks and the reason being is there are

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.670 
bucks and the reason being is there are
two<00:00:23.310> plastic<00:00:23.550> bushings<00:00:24.350> one<00:00:25.350> of<00:00:25.470> them

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
two plastic bushings one of them

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.569 
two plastic bushings one of them
connects<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.820> shifter<00:00:28.939> and<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.750> other

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:31.579 
connects to the shifter and the other

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:33.709 
connects to the shifter and the other
let's<00:00:32.579> see<00:00:32.880> if<00:00:32.969> we<00:00:33.120> can<00:00:33.239> look<00:00:33.360> in<00:00:33.540> there

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
let's see if we can look in there

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.590 
let's see if we can look in there
underneath<00:00:34.140> that<00:00:34.500> pan<00:00:34.739> if<00:00:34.980> you<00:00:35.100> see<00:00:35.450> see<00:00:36.450> if<00:00:36.540> I

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
underneath that pan if you see see if I

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.299 
underneath that pan if you see see if I
can<00:00:36.750> touch<00:00:36.930> it

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
can touch it

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.569 
can touch it
this<00:00:38.309> right<00:00:39.090> here<00:00:39.620> that's<00:00:40.620> how<00:00:40.890> transmission

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
this right here that's how transmission

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.470 
this right here that's how transmission
is<00:00:41.670> still<00:00:41.850> hot<00:00:42.500> right<00:00:43.500> here<00:00:44.000> that<00:00:45.000> is<00:00:45.270> where

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
is still hot right here that is where

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.190 
is still hot right here that is where
the<00:00:45.600> other<00:00:45.719> one<00:00:45.899> is<00:00:47.300> connects<00:00:48.300> shift<00:00:48.660> cable<00:00:49.079> to

the other one is connects shift cable to

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.410 
the other one is connects shift cable to
two<00:00:49.379> different<00:00:49.590> metal<00:00:49.980> spots<00:00:50.239> for<00:00:51.239> some

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
two different metal spots for some

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.670 
two different metal spots for some
reason<00:00:51.809> chevrolet<00:00:52.140> thought<00:00:52.320> it'd<00:00:52.440> be<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.530> great

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
reason chevrolet thought it'd be a great

reason chevrolet thought it'd be a great
idea<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:53.309> have<00:00:54.230> very<00:00:55.230> shitty<00:00:55.590> plastic<00:00:56.280> for

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
idea to have very shitty plastic for

pulled out the grommet which was
literally<00:01:23.549> very<00:01:24.150> detailed<00:01:26.330> thermal<00:01:27.330> work<00:01:27.509> and

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
literally very detailed thermal work and

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.649 
literally very detailed thermal work and

stuff like that anyway that a little

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.210 
stuff like that anyway that a little
grease<00:01:33.869> and<00:01:34.200> it<00:01:34.320> slipped<00:01:34.560> in<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.130> it

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
grease and it slipped in and it

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.149 
grease and it slipped in and it
functioned<00:01:35.970> fine<00:01:36.210> up<00:01:36.390> there<00:01:37.009> and<00:01:38.009> then<00:01:38.130> just

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
functioned fine up there and then just

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.960 
functioned fine up there and then just
the<00:01:38.850> other<00:01:38.909> night<00:01:39.030> messed<00:01:39.990> up<00:01:40.140> this<00:01:40.700> well<00:01:41.700> I

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
the other night messed up this well I

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.819 
the other night messed up this well I
don't<00:01:42.479> feel<00:01:42.689> like<00:01:42.869> going<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.200> junkyard

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
don't feel like going to a junkyard

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.399 
don't feel like going to a junkyard
so<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.040> took<00:01:44.630> essentially<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.810> clothes<00:01:46.229> hanger

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
so I took essentially a clothes hanger

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.520 
so I took essentially a clothes hanger
clothes<00:01:47.009> hanger<00:01:47.750> I'm<00:01:48.750> saying<00:01:49.110> it's<00:01:49.259> probably

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
clothes hanger I'm saying it's probably

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.929 
clothes hanger I'm saying it's probably
about<00:01:49.590> four<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.009> half<00:01:50.040> five<00:01:50.340> inches<00:01:50.729> worth

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
about four and a half five inches worth

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.109 
about four and a half five inches worth
maybe<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.390> little<00:01:51.600> more<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.790> once<00:01:53.790> I<00:01:53.880> got<00:01:54.000> the

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
maybe a little more and once I got the

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.010 
maybe a little more and once I got the
entire<00:01:54.390> grommet<00:01:54.840> out<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:55.170> ran<00:01:56.000> through<00:01:57.020> let's

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
entire grommet out I ran through let's

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.270 
entire grommet out I ran through let's
see

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
see

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.640 
see
anyway<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.480> see<00:02:00.690> it<00:02:00.780> through<00:02:01.050> that<00:02:01.200> top<00:02:01.410> hole

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
anyway you see it through that top hole

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.970 
anyway you see it through that top hole
I<00:02:01.860> ran<00:02:02.160> it<00:02:02.370> through<00:02:03.200> pushed<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:04.350> up<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:04.800> I'd

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:04.980 
I ran it through pushed it up and I'd

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.150 
I ran it through pushed it up and I'd
use<00:02:05.250> two<00:02:05.520> pliers<00:02:05.820> and<00:02:06.180> really<00:02:06.840> just<00:02:07.050> locked<00:02:07.979> in

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
use two pliers and really just locked in

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.960 
use two pliers and really just locked in
as<00:02:08.369> best<00:02:08.490> I<00:02:08.700> could

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
as best I could
