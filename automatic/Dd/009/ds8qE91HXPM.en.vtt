00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.549 

moving<00:00:36.480> us<00:00:36.600> help

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.750 

basically<00:00:41.559> it's<00:00:41.829> a<00:00:41.920> showing<00:00:42.219> it<00:00:42.610> has<00:00:42.730> a

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
basically it's a showing it has a

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.110 
basically it's a showing it has a
humidity<00:00:43.239> sensor<00:00:43.600> in<00:00:44.140> adding<00:00:44.440> up<00:00:44.530> to<00:00:44.559> any<00:00:44.860> any

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
humidity sensor in adding up to any any

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.530 
humidity sensor in adding up to any any
anything<00:00:46.120> that<00:00:46.269> shone<00:00:46.480> and<00:00:46.690> collects<00:00:46.960> s3<00:00:47.320> so

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540 
anything that shone and collects s3 so

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.030 
anything that shone and collects s3 so
it's<00:00:49.540> checking<00:00:49.780> your<00:00:50.019> surroundings<00:00:50.680> it's

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.040 
it's checking your surroundings it's

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.180 
it's checking your surroundings it's
checking<00:00:51.820> temperature<00:00:52.420> and<00:00:53.140> also<00:00:53.649> humidity

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
checking temperature and also humidity

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.509 
checking temperature and also humidity
so<00:00:54.699> there<00:00:55.030> is<00:00:55.059> a<00:00:55.149> comfort<00:00:56.110> level<00:00:56.140> if<00:00:57.010> it's<00:00:57.190> away

00:00:57.509 --> 00:00:57.519 
so there is a comfort level if it's away

00:00:57.519 --> 00:00:59.310 
so there is a comfort level if it's away
from<00:00:57.550> the<00:00:57.850> comfort<00:00:58.149> level<00:00:58.269> it<00:00:58.809> is<00:00:58.960> showing<00:00:59.170> a

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320
