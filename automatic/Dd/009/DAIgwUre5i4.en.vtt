 always keep an eye on the fuses 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.640
 this having a long life 

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:06.850
 it costs nothing to do a checkup at all 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.610

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:17.110
 the fillets because the professional never 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.370
 had the exact patience to use the 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.340
 appropriate instrument 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.980
 usually uses a blade that serves as a 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.660
 trash ends up ripping the fillets start 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.920
 it ends up damaging the system 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.870
