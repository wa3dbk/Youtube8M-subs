I'm<00:00:48.450> talking<00:00:49.079> about<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.680> tempo<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.520> your

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
I'm talking about the tempo of your

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.939 
I'm talking about the tempo of your
weight<00:00:51.420> lifting<00:00:51.930> so<00:00:52.320> let's<00:00:52.469> get<00:00:52.590> into<00:00:52.770> this

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
weight lifting so let's get into this

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.220 
weight lifting so let's get into this
all<00:00:53.879> right<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:54.390> here<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:54.690> see<00:00:54.719> me<00:00:55.020> on<00:00:55.140> the

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
all right so here you see me on the

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.680 
all right so here you see me on the
incline<00:00:55.649> barbell<00:00:56.129> press<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.940> where<00:00:57.480> you

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
incline barbell press and where you

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.810 
incline barbell press and where you
build<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.079> most<00:00:58.350> mass<00:00:58.620> in<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.039> most<00:00:59.370> strength

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
build the most mass in the most strength

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.270 
build the most mass in the most strength
is<00:01:00.120> in<00:01:00.660> that<00:01:00.899> eccentric<00:01:01.469> or<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:02.039> negative

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
is in that eccentric or the negative

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.520 
is in that eccentric or the negative
portion<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.449> lowering<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:04.199> the

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
portion that is the lowering of the

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.890 
portion that is the lowering of the
weight<00:01:04.979> so<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.030> lowering<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.630> weights

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
weight so the lowering of the weights

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.350 
weight so the lowering of the weights
not<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.680> lifting<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.430> weights<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:08.909> where

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
not the lifting of the weights is where

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.149 
not the lifting of the weights is where
all<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.020> muscles<00:01:10.200> learners<00:01:10.710> come<00:01:10.890> from

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
all of the muscles learners come from

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.590 
all of the muscles learners come from
and<00:01:11.340> this<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:11.610> what<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.850> stimulus<00:01:12.270> is<00:01:12.390> that

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
and this is what the stimulus is that

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.410 
and this is what the stimulus is that
creates<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.049> adaptation<00:01:13.430> to<00:01:14.430> grow<00:01:14.729> muscle

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
creates that adaptation to grow muscle

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.929 
creates that adaptation to grow muscle
or<00:01:15.600> your<00:01:15.780> hypertrophy<00:01:16.500> of<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.770> muscle<00:01:17.640> this

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
or your hypertrophy of the muscle this

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.090 
or your hypertrophy of the muscle this
is<00:01:18.119> key<00:01:18.390> make<00:01:18.930> sure<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.259> follow<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.890> proper

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
is key make sure you follow the proper

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.090 
is key make sure you follow the proper
tempos<00:01:20.670> when<00:01:20.909> you're<00:01:21.030> lowering<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.659> weight

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
tempos when you're lowering the weight

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.219 
tempos when you're lowering the weight
so<00:01:23.100> for<00:01:23.369> tempo<00:01:23.790> this<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.600> lowering<00:01:24.990> of<00:01:25.170> the

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
so for tempo this is the lowering of the

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.140 
so for tempo this is the lowering of the
way<00:01:25.409> this<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.009> pause<00:01:26.250> at<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.610> bottom<00:01:26.790> if

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
way this is the pause at the bottom if

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.120 
way this is the pause at the bottom if
this<00:01:27.540> is<00:01:27.720> lifting<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.590> weight<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:28.950> then<00:01:29.009> the

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
this is lifting the weight and then the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.490 
this is lifting the weight and then the
pause<00:01:29.369> at<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.759> top<00:01:29.790> it's<00:01:30.210> for<00:01:30.540> numbers<00:01:31.110> the

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
pause at the top it's for numbers the

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.499 
pause at the top it's for numbers the
first<00:01:31.829> number<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.400> what<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.909> eccentric<00:01:33.360> is

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
first number is what the eccentric is

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.870 
first number is what the eccentric is
the<00:01:33.810> lowering<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.380> way<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:35.070> grow<00:01:35.400> muscle

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
the lowering of the way to grow muscle

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.640 
the lowering of the way to grow muscle
to<00:01:36.090> build<00:01:36.390> strength<00:01:36.720> I<00:01:36.960> like<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.290> use<00:01:37.380> an

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
to build strength I like to use an

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.969 
to build strength I like to use an
eccentric<00:01:38.189> tempo<00:01:38.759> of<00:01:39.000> three<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:40.079> six<00:01:40.439> seconds

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
eccentric tempo of three to six seconds

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.910 
eccentric tempo of three to six seconds
so<00:01:41.310> one<00:01:41.520> 1,000<00:01:42.150> two<00:01:42.180> 1,000<00:01:43.079> three<00:01:43.110> 1,000<00:01:43.890> four

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
so one 1,000 two 1,000 three 1,000 four

i<00:01:46.860> usually<00:01:47.310> don't<00:01:47.520> use<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:47.820> pause<00:01:48.240> because<00:01:48.570> i

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
i usually don't use a pause because i

i usually don't use a pause because i
like<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.960> keep<00:01:49.079> that<00:01:49.229> tension<00:01:49.470> on<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.799> muscle

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
like to keep that tension on the muscle

like to keep that tension on the muscle
same<00:01:50.610> thing<00:01:50.790> at<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:50.970> top<00:01:51.180> but<00:01:51.659> then<00:01:51.720> when<00:01:52.020> you

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
same thing at the top but then when you

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.499 
same thing at the top but then when you
lift<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.649> weight<00:01:52.829> usually<00:01:53.610> a<00:01:53.640> like<00:01:53.850> a<00:01:54.000> one<00:01:54.360> two

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
lift the weight usually a like a one two

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.749 
lift the weight usually a like a one two
three<00:01:54.780> second<00:01:55.229> concentric<00:01:55.890> or<00:01:56.100> lifting<00:01:56.549> of

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
three second concentric or lifting of

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.719 
three second concentric or lifting of
the<00:01:56.909> way<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.950> this<00:01:58.950> here<00:01:59.219> is<00:01:59.310> what<00:01:59.460> i<00:01:59.490> see<00:01:59.700> so

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
muscle game so remember eccentric keep

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.809 
muscle game so remember eccentric keep
it<00:02:06.509> slow<00:02:06.719> on<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.530> concentric<00:02:08.190> you<00:02:08.550> can<00:02:08.700> go

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
it slow on the concentric you can go

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:09.830 
it slow on the concentric you can go
between<00:02:09.030> one<00:02:09.479> just

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.780 
between one just
three<00:02:09.959> seconds<00:02:10.470> and<00:02:10.679> then<00:02:11.009> once<00:02:11.430> again<00:02:11.670> that
