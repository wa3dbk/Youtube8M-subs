00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
super simple you just line up the

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.869 
super simple you just line up the
corners<00:01:58.069> where<00:01:58.220> where<00:01:58.369> it's<00:01:58.489> supposed<00:01:58.550> to<00:01:58.789> go

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
protective when it's inside I think even

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.630 
protective when it's inside I think even
if<00:02:17.690> you<00:02:17.720> were<00:02:17.900> to<00:02:18.080> drop<00:02:18.319> it<00:02:18.560> it<00:02:19.040> would<00:02:19.160> still<00:02:19.459> be

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
if you were to drop it it would still be

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.430 
if you were to drop it it would still be
okay<00:02:19.940> I<00:02:19.970> have<00:02:20.209> not<00:02:20.390> done<00:02:20.690> any<00:02:20.900> type<00:02:21.140> of<00:02:21.170> drop

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
okay I have not done any type of drop

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.440 
okay I have not done any type of drop
test<00:02:21.709> because<00:02:22.069> I<00:02:22.459> do<00:02:22.879> not<00:02:23.090> feel<00:02:23.150> like

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
test because I do not feel like

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.240 
test because I do not feel like
replacing<00:02:23.989> my<00:02:24.140> iPad<00:02:24.500> if<00:02:24.650> it<00:02:24.800> worked<00:02:24.980> a<00:02:25.069> break

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
replacing my iPad if it worked a break

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.250 
replacing my iPad if it worked a break
but<00:02:26.000> it<00:02:26.090> feels<00:02:26.239> super<00:02:26.450> sturdy<00:02:26.810> in<00:02:27.019> there<00:02:27.230> I

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
but it feels super sturdy in there I

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.140 
but it feels super sturdy in there I
mean<00:02:27.440> it's<00:02:27.590> not<00:02:27.709> like<00:02:27.890> a<00:02:27.950> life<00:02:28.220> purse<00:02:28.489> or<00:02:28.700> not<00:02:28.909> a

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
mean it's not like a life purse or not a

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.869 
mean it's not like a life purse or not a
lifeproof<00:02:29.840> or<00:02:30.080> an<00:02:30.170> otterbox<00:02:30.620> by<00:02:30.800> any<00:02:31.069> means

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:31.879 
lifeproof or an otterbox by any means

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:33.640 
lifeproof or an otterbox by any means
but<00:02:32.209> it<00:02:33.019> definitely<00:02:33.140> keeps<00:02:33.379> it<00:02:33.560> protected

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
but it definitely keeps it protected

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.320 
but it definitely keeps it protected
when<00:02:34.069> you're<00:02:34.190> out<00:02:34.310> and<00:02:34.400> about<00:02:34.459> another<00:02:35.090> thing

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
when you're out and about another thing

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.640 
when you're out and about another thing
I<00:02:35.450> really<00:02:35.569> like<00:02:35.780> about<00:02:35.810> this<00:02:36.110> case<00:02:36.319> is<00:02:36.470> if<00:02:36.620> you

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
I really like about this case is if you

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.410 
I really like about this case is if you
don't<00:02:37.069> want<00:02:37.340> to<00:02:37.489> use<00:02:37.610> the<00:02:37.790> keyboard<00:02:37.970> and<00:02:38.360> you

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
don't want to use the keyboard and you

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.089 
don't want to use the keyboard and you
just<00:02:38.659> want<00:02:38.840> to<00:02:38.900> use<00:02:38.989> the<00:02:39.110> iPad<00:02:39.440> you<00:02:39.830> don't<00:02:40.010> have

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
just want to use the iPad you don't have

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:41.860 
just want to use the iPad you don't have
to<00:02:40.190> take<00:02:40.310> it<00:02:40.459> out<00:02:40.550> of<00:02:40.640> the<00:02:40.700> case<00:02:40.880> you<00:02:41.569> can<00:02:41.690> just

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
to take it out of the case you can just

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.860 
to take it out of the case you can just
open<00:02:42.020> it<00:02:42.200> up<00:02:42.350> fold<00:02:43.250> it<00:02:43.340> over<00:02:43.490> like<00:02:43.700> so

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
open it up fold it over like so

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.380 
open it up fold it over like so
and<00:02:44.959> it<00:02:45.319> it<00:02:46.129> kind<00:02:46.430> of<00:02:46.489> elevates<00:02:46.640> the<00:02:47.030> iPad

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
and it it kind of elevates the iPad

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.270 
and it it kind of elevates the iPad
which<00:02:47.540> is<00:02:47.659> nice<00:02:47.840> especially<00:02:48.500> if<00:02:48.860> you're<00:02:49.010> just

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
which is nice especially if you're just

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.559 
which is nice especially if you're just
keeping<00:02:49.400> it<00:02:49.580> on<00:02:49.640> a<00:02:49.670> desk<00:02:49.970> or<00:02:50.180> even<00:02:50.420> if<00:02:50.480> you're

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:50.569 
keeping it on a desk or even if you're

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:52.449 
keeping it on a desk or even if you're
just<00:02:50.750> holding<00:02:50.870> in<00:02:51.080> your<00:02:51.140> hand<00:02:51.409> it<00:02:52.099> does<00:02:52.250> add<00:02:52.400> a

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
just holding in your hand it does add a

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.930 
just holding in your hand it does add a
tiny<00:02:52.790> little<00:02:53.170> weight<00:02:54.170> to<00:02:54.440> it<00:02:54.519> but<00:02:55.519> you<00:02:55.670> still

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
tiny little weight to it but you still

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.360 
tiny little weight to it but you still
get<00:02:56.540> to<00:02:56.690> just<00:02:56.900> keep<00:02:57.170> the<00:02:57.349> iPad<00:02:57.739> isolated<00:02:58.310> if

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
get to just keep the iPad isolated if

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.520 
get to just keep the iPad isolated if
you<00:02:58.459> just<00:02:58.670> want<00:02:58.849> to<00:02:58.909> use<00:02:59.000> that<00:02:59.140> and<00:03:00.140> then<00:03:00.379> if

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
you just want to use that and then if

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.289 
you just want to use that and then if
you<00:03:00.650> want<00:03:01.040> to<00:03:01.099> use<00:03:01.250> the<00:03:01.400> keyboard<00:03:01.790> as<00:03:01.940> simple

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
you want to use the keyboard as simple

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.170 
you want to use the keyboard as simple
as<00:03:02.480> just<00:03:02.510> flipping<00:03:03.140> this<00:03:03.319> up<00:03:03.790> putting<00:03:04.790> it<00:03:05.000> into

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
as just flipping this up putting it into

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.059 
as just flipping this up putting it into
place<00:03:05.420> and<00:03:05.690> then<00:03:06.170> you<00:03:06.260> can<00:03:06.500> adjust<00:03:06.590> all<00:03:06.980> the

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
place and then you can adjust all the

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:10.330 
place and then you can adjust all the
angles<00:03:07.400> on<00:03:07.519> the<00:03:07.610> iPad<00:03:07.940> just<00:03:08.620> like<00:03:09.620> so<00:03:09.920> where

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
angles on the iPad just like so where

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.250 
angles on the iPad just like so where
you<00:03:10.400> can<00:03:10.519> put<00:03:10.670> it<00:03:10.760> one<00:03:10.909> notch<00:03:11.060> back<00:03:11.360> and<00:03:11.690> get<00:03:12.230> a

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
you can put it one notch back and get a

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.780 
you can put it one notch back and get a
couple<00:03:12.470> more<00:03:12.709> angles<00:03:13.310> so<00:03:13.430> there's<00:03:13.640> probably

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
couple more angles so there's probably

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.309 
couple more angles so there's probably
about<00:03:14.030> ten<00:03:14.450> different<00:03:14.750> angles<00:03:15.019> that<00:03:15.110> you<00:03:15.200> can

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
about ten different angles that you can

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:18.190 
about ten different angles that you can
put<00:03:15.470> on<00:03:15.590> this<00:03:15.709> thing<00:03:15.950> and<00:03:16.239> it's<00:03:17.239> just<00:03:17.540> a<00:03:17.720> super

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
put on this thing and it's just a super

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.099 
put on this thing and it's just a super
reliable<00:03:18.640> awesome<00:03:19.640> keyboard<00:03:20.209> for<00:03:20.959> the<00:03:21.019> iPad
