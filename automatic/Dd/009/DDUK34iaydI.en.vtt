00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.850
 I will say that the first period we of course 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.970
 lost all 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:12.950
 Yu 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.840
 although what 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.600
 This is if you want that all will play 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.450
 so it is active in general but it turned out 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:23.300
 good that you kept the first stopped 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:27.230
 his feints have played well won 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:32.809
 the third period again due to an error found 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:37.430
 striker missed a goal but quirks 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:40.149
 i will say what wrong means played 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:43.129
 forward attacked defender 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:46.750
 lost so much good world on 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:50.750
 match turned out fighting yes guys well done 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:56.720
 hard match for us we feared him from 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:59.470
 match came a good opponent to 1 before 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:04.009
 played great second sunk so 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:06.979
 decent and well asked anyway 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:11.540
 all the same guys play tolerate play my 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:14.560
 error was found error was found scored 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:17.889
 Goal overtime we were lucky 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.130
 again I say it can be like that 

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:22.520
 won 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:27.530
 But that's great, again, I want to say 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:29.749
 that we feared very much for this game we 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.200
 Well done guys that pulled this 

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:32.200
 tough match 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:52.299
 bringing sat down and somehow finish 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:57.399
 years this does not say blacksmith injury 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:57.399
 order and through it the motivation to play 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:06.829
 leaves motivation for a skirt for everyone 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.959
 player is and need to think today means 

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:12.410
 but he didnâ€™t hit our whole life 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:14.959
 ahead of her young therefore principle 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:18.769
 Not bad today, I played badly 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:22.130
 1 my mother I think that from a boy a match 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:25.269
 will add and maybe irina 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.269
 world championship will fall 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:38.170
 waiting for these 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:58.209
 bigger big window like a team in 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:03:00.239
 team but we want cities to be better but 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.799
 once again I want to say 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:05.760
 great thanks to the mayor for leadership 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:08.489
 the governor probably the team owners 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.829
 which is 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:20.769
 when extended most control yes it 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:25.510
 of course very well I'm glad yes there is not 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:26.170
 before signing I was there literally 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.400
 option 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:34.530
 and which she just went on in 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:38.169
 In general, here it is not so necessary to approach 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:41.609
 very deeply so clean I had 

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:41.609
 almost two-year contract
