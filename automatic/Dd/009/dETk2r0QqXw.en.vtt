something<00:02:37.530> like<00:02:37.650> a<00:02:37.740> thirty<00:02:38.040> percent

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
something like a thirty percent

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.480 
something like a thirty percent
reduction<00:02:38.640> in<00:02:39.240> the<00:02:40.200> with<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.130> AIDS<00:02:41.280> vaccine

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490
