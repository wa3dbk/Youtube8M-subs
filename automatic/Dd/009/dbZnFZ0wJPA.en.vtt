here's<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.670> plug<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.560> I<00:01:31.560> drilled<00:01:31.890> out<00:01:32.070> a

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
here's the plug and I drilled out a

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.690 
here's the plug and I drilled out a
little<00:01:32.640> section<00:01:33.150> in<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:33.840> cover<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:35.040> run<00:01:35.579> the

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
little section in that cover to run the

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.870 
little section in that cover to run the
wire<00:01:35.909> up<00:01:36.060> underneath<00:01:36.329> nice<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:36.900> neat<00:01:40.880> okay

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
wire up underneath nice and neat okay

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.670 
wire up underneath nice and neat okay
now<00:01:42.090> on<00:01:42.240> this<00:01:42.360> bezel<00:01:42.780> piece<00:01:45.380> okay<00:01:46.380> here's<00:01:46.590> how

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
now on this bezel piece okay here's how

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.889 
now on this bezel piece okay here's how
it<00:01:46.890> sits<00:01:47.040> on<00:01:47.250> here<00:01:47.520> so<00:01:48.270> when<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:48.450> pick<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.720> up

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
it sits on here so when you pick it up

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.770 
it sits on here so when you pick it up
and<00:01:49.110> flip<00:01:49.950> it<00:01:50.189> over<00:01:51.680> there's<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.890> notch<00:01:53.780> right

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
and flip it over there's the notch right

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.789 
and flip it over there's the notch right
there<00:01:55.049> where<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.490> core<00:01:56.490> can<00:01:56.729> lay<00:01:56.850> into<00:01:57.799> so

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
there where the core can lay into so

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.850 
there where the core can lay into so
what<00:01:58.979> I<00:01:59.009> did<00:01:59.100> was<00:01:59.280> I<00:02:01.340> ran<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.520> cord<00:02:03.560> down<00:02:04.560> past

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
what I did was I ran the cord down past

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.310 
what I did was I ran the cord down past
the<00:02:04.979> switches<00:02:05.399> right<00:02:05.549> here<00:02:05.759> so<00:02:06.060> if<00:02:06.840> you<00:02:06.899> drill

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
the switches right here so if you drill

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.210 
the switches right here so if you drill
the<00:02:07.350> hole<00:02:07.619> in<00:02:07.860> this<00:02:07.979> little<00:02:08.250> section<00:02:10.039> you<00:02:11.039> see

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
the hole in this little section you see

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.970 
the hole in this little section you see
where<00:02:11.400> it's<00:02:11.520> recessed<00:02:11.970> right<00:02:12.209> there

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
where it's recessed right there

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.310 
where it's recessed right there
there's<00:02:14.980> a<00:02:15.040> little<00:02:15.250> notch<00:02:16.020> it<00:02:17.020> works<00:02:17.170> out

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
there's a little notch it works out

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.350 
there's a little notch it works out
pretty<00:02:17.470> good<00:02:17.770> that<00:02:18.190> way<00:02:18.370> this<00:02:18.760> acts<00:02:19.060> as<00:02:19.300> a

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
pretty good that way this acts as a

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.230 
pretty good that way this acts as a
guide<00:02:19.660> the<00:02:20.020> switch<00:02:20.290> panel<00:02:20.740> so<00:02:21.730> when<00:02:22.000> you<00:02:22.090> put

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
guide the switch panel so when you put

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.090 
guide the switch panel so when you put
it<00:02:22.360> back<00:02:22.480> together<00:02:22.600> it's<00:02:23.110> easy<00:02:23.290> to<00:02:23.470> fish<00:02:23.890> the

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
it back together it's easy to fish the

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.260 
it back together it's easy to fish the
core<00:02:24.700> down<00:02:24.940> through<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.920> I<00:02:27.640> just<00:02:27.790> use<00:02:27.940> a<00:02:27.970> round

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
core down through and I just use a round

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.780 
core down through and I just use a round
nose<00:02:28.450> file<00:02:29.430> and<00:02:30.430> basically<00:02:31.240> just<00:02:32.790> file

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
nose file and basically just file

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.900 
nose file and basically just file
downward<00:02:34.420> on<00:02:34.630> this<00:02:36.510> like<00:02:37.510> that<00:02:38.340> to<00:02:39.340> run<00:02:39.610> it<00:02:39.760> off

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
downward on this like that to run it off

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.430 
downward on this like that to run it off
just<00:02:40.210> enough<00:02:40.390> to<00:02:40.750> where<00:02:40.930> you<00:02:41.110> can<00:02:41.260> get<00:02:41.380> your

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
just enough to where you can get your

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.140 
just enough to where you can get your
cord<00:02:41.800> in<00:02:41.890> there<00:02:41.920> you<00:02:42.670> don't<00:02:42.790> want<00:02:42.910> to<00:02:42.970> file

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
cord in there you don't want to file

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.480 
cord in there you don't want to file
back<00:02:43.480> like<00:02:43.720> this<00:02:43.960> because<00:02:44.230> this<00:02:44.770> is<00:02:44.830> aluminum

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
back like this because this is aluminum

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:47.520 
back like this because this is aluminum
right<00:02:45.610> here<00:02:45.820> and<00:02:46.600> it<00:02:46.720> will<00:02:46.750> actually<00:02:46.990> peel

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
right here and it will actually peel

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.760 
right here and it will actually peel
this<00:02:47.710> away<00:02:48.430> from<00:02:48.490> your<00:02:49.000> piece<00:02:49.570> here<00:02:49.870> so<00:02:50.680> you

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
this away from your piece here so you

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.350 
this away from your piece here so you
don't<00:02:50.800> ruin<00:02:51.160> it<00:02:51.340> so<00:02:51.400> just<00:02:51.550> take<00:02:51.970> your<00:02:52.090> time<00:02:52.150> and

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
don't ruin it so just take your time and

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
don't ruin it so just take your time and
file<00:02:53.050> it<00:02:53.170> down<00:02:55.980> also<00:02:56.980> on<00:02:57.070> the<00:02:57.190> ultra<00:02:57.430> gauge<00:02:58.380> if

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
file it down also on the ultra gauge if

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.110 
file it down also on the ultra gauge if
he<00:02:59.560> knows<00:02:59.710> back<00:03:00.040> here<00:03:00.250> I<00:03:00.310> got<00:03:00.490> two<00:03:00.730> pieces<00:03:01.090> of

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
he knows back here I got two pieces of

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.560 
he knows back here I got two pieces of
foam<00:03:01.420> I<00:03:02.070> sent<00:03:03.070> them<00:03:03.130> there<00:03:03.310> to<00:03:03.370> tilt<00:03:03.880> the<00:03:03.970> ultra

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
foam I sent them there to tilt the ultra

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.930 
foam I sent them there to tilt the ultra
gauge<00:03:04.780> up<00:03:05.170> towards<00:03:05.860> me<00:03:06.100> more<00:03:06.340> so<00:03:06.520> you<00:03:06.610> can<00:03:06.760> see

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
gauge up towards me more so you can see

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.540 
gauge up towards me more so you can see
it<00:03:07.030> easier<00:03:07.450> works<00:03:07.750> out<00:03:07.870> pretty<00:03:07.930> good<00:03:08.430> so<00:03:09.430> when

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550
