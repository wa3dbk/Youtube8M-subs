game I just thought I'd play it since i

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.880 
game I just thought I'd play it since i
hadn't<00:00:19.890> played<00:00:20.039> in<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.310> long<00:00:20.340> time<00:00:21.260> and<00:00:22.260> show

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
hadn't played in a long time and show

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.590 
hadn't played in a long time and show
you<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.100> game<00:00:23.250> boy<00:00:23.430> version<00:00:23.460> it's<00:00:24.330> it's

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
you the game boy version it's it's

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.519 
you the game boy version it's it's
identical<00:00:25.109> just<00:00:25.769> you<00:00:26.010> know<00:00:26.130> black<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:27.060> white

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:27.529 
identical just you know black and white

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.700 
identical just you know black and white
um<00:00:28.529> I<00:00:29.300> don't<00:00:30.300> know<00:00:30.510> me<00:00:30.779> there<00:00:31.199> might<00:00:31.380> be<00:00:31.410> like

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
um I don't know me there might be like

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.229 
um I don't know me there might be like
subtle<00:00:32.340> differences<00:00:33.260> but<00:00:34.260> probably<00:00:34.649> not<00:00:34.800> much

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
subtle differences but probably not much

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.910 
subtle differences but probably not much
so<00:00:36.239> your<00:00:36.450> point<00:00:36.690> is<00:00:36.899> for<00:00:37.290> those<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:37.680> might

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
so your point is for those that might

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.580 
so your point is for those that might

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
is pretty much what you see is what

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.750 
is pretty much what you see is what
you're<00:04:55.330> getting<00:04:55.710> it<00:04:56.710> is<00:04:56.950> pretty<00:04:57.130> like<00:04:57.580> I<00:04:57.700> said

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
you're getting it is pretty like I said

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:00.200 
you're getting it is pretty like I said
it<00:04:58.150> was<00:04:58.479> an<00:04:58.599> arcade<00:04:58.960> game<00:04:58.990> makes<00:04:59.590> sense<00:04:59.830> why

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
it was an arcade game makes sense why

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.839 
it was an arcade game makes sense why
it's<00:05:01.210> pretty<00:05:01.570> much<00:05:01.720> just<00:05:02.160> just<00:05:03.160> that<00:05:03.370> quick

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:03.849 
it's pretty much just just that quick

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:05.400 
it's pretty much just just that quick
play<00:05:04.120> something<00:05:04.810> you<00:05:04.930> know<00:05:05.050> you'd<00:05:05.200> put<00:05:05.380> a

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
play something you know you'd put a

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.339 
play something you know you'd put a
quarter<00:05:05.710> in<00:05:05.860> right<00:05:06.310> play<00:05:06.550> 11<00:05:07.120> credits<00:05:07.930> worth

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:08.349 
quarter in right play 11 credits worth

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:13.710 
quarter in right play 11 credits worth
and<00:05:08.680> walk<00:05:09.400> away<00:05:11.580> walk<00:05:12.580> away<00:05:12.639> satisfied<00:05:13.150> with

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
and walk away walk away satisfied with

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.230 
and walk away walk away satisfied with
the<00:05:14.460> with<00:05:15.460> your<00:05:15.639> elevator<00:05:16.030> action<00:05:16.300> fix<00:05:16.900> I

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
the with your elevator action fix I

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.879 
the with your elevator action fix I
think<00:05:19.240> in<00:05:19.389> this<00:05:19.510> one<00:05:19.750> also<00:05:19.930> you<00:05:20.139> can<00:05:20.289> drop<00:05:20.530> one

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:20.889 
think in this one also you can drop one

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:23.700 
think in this one also you can drop one
level<00:05:21.280> with<00:05:21.940> that<00:05:22.090> dime<00:05:22.330> yeah<00:05:22.840> I<00:05:23.139> like<00:05:23.440> that<00:05:23.470> I

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
level with that dime yeah I like that I

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.219 
level with that dime yeah I like that I
think<00:05:23.830> NES<00:05:24.400> version<00:05:24.789> again<00:05:25.030> that<00:05:25.330> you

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:26.229 
think NES version again that you

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:29.640 
think NES version again that you
couldn't<00:05:26.530> do<00:05:26.650> that<00:05:27.960> so<00:05:28.960> I<00:05:28.990> gets<00:05:29.169> me<00:05:29.320> this<00:05:29.500> one

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
couldn't do that so I gets me this one

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.080 
couldn't do that so I gets me this one
was<00:05:29.770> just<00:05:29.919> dumb<00:05:30.099> down<00:05:30.280> a<00:05:30.340> little<00:05:30.550> bit<00:05:30.760> to<00:05:30.970> be<00:05:31.060> a

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 
was just dumb down a little bit to be a

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.330 
was just dumb down a little bit to be a
little<00:05:31.300> more<00:05:31.389> forgiving<00:05:31.960> a<00:05:32.220> little<00:05:33.220> more

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340 
little more forgiving a little more

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:38.980 
little more forgiving a little more
casual<00:05:33.849> than<00:05:34.020> in<00:05:35.020> the<00:05:35.169> arcade<00:05:35.500> counterpart

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:38.990 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.970 

I<00:05:40.510> think<00:05:41.510> I'm<00:05:41.600> missing<00:05:41.780> some<00:05:42.230> exclamation

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:42.980 
I think I'm missing some exclamation

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:46.000 
I think I'm missing some exclamation
rooms<00:05:43.660> now<00:05:44.660> stick<00:05:44.990> with<00:05:45.020> this<00:05:45.290> gun<00:05:45.680> for<00:05:45.890> now

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.010 
rooms now stick with this gun for now

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:49.120 
rooms now stick with this gun for now
it's<00:05:46.250> all<00:05:46.430> right<00:05:46.640> I<00:05:46.910> think<00:05:47.560> you<00:05:48.560> can<00:05:48.710> also<00:05:48.860> get

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.130 
it's all right I think you can also get

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:51.850 
it's all right I think you can also get
health<00:05:49.370> by<00:05:49.670> the<00:05:50.360> question<00:05:50.690> marks<00:05:50.960> it's<00:05:51.650> all

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860 
health by the question marks it's all

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.530 
health by the question marks it's all
randomly<00:05:52.310> generated<00:05:52.970> what<00:05:53.180> you're<00:05:53.360> gonna

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:53.540 
randomly generated what you're gonna

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:57.580 
randomly generated what you're gonna
walk<00:05:53.870> out<00:05:54.080> with<00:05:54.550> so<00:05:55.550> there's<00:05:56.240> never<00:05:56.470> you<00:05:57.470> never

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:57.590 
walk out with so there's never you never

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.050 
walk out with so there's never you never
know<00:05:57.860> if<00:05:58.040> there's<00:05:58.250> health<00:05:58.490> and<00:05:58.670> there<00:05:58.790> or<00:05:58.910> not

00:05:59.050 --> 00:05:59.060 
know if there's health and there or not

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.750 
know if there's health and there or not
but<00:05:59.420> that<00:06:00.200> is<00:06:00.350> the<00:06:00.500> only<00:06:00.890> way<00:06:01.100> to<00:06:01.160> regenerate

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:01.760 
but that is the only way to regenerate

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.920 
but that is the only way to regenerate
rather<00:06:02.090> than<00:06:03.940> see<00:06:04.940> I<00:06:05.000> just<00:06:05.060> need<00:06:05.600> to<00:06:05.630> see<00:06:05.900> if

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:05.930 
rather than see I just need to see if

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:07.270 
rather than see I just need to see if
that<00:06:06.110> was<00:06:06.230> a<00:06:06.260> question<00:06:06.500> mark<00:06:06.830> or<00:06:06.980> not<00:06:07.130> up<00:06:07.250> there

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 
that was a question mark or not up there

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.600 
that was a question mark or not up there
can<00:06:07.700> tell<00:06:09.160> that's<00:06:10.160> during<00:06:10.400> the<00:06:10.460> way<00:06:10.550> of

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.610 
can tell that's during the way of

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.080 
can tell that's during the way of
gaining<00:06:11.240> health<00:06:11.600> is<00:06:11.900> just<00:06:12.740> a<00:06:12.980> wild<00:06:13.520> guess<00:06:13.700> to

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:14.090 
gaining health is just a wild guess to

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:21.940 
gaining health is just a wild guess to
get<00:06:14.210> lucky<00:06:14.570> and<00:06:14.720> get<00:06:14.930> get<00:06:15.470> some<00:06:15.620> hearts<00:06:20.950> yeah

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:21.950

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:25.460 
thought it was pretty cool how it worked

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:34.050
