population<00:03:13.260> village<00:03:13.500> as<00:03:13.620> well<00:03:13.800> that<00:03:14.280> we<00:03:14.400> got

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
population village as well that we got

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.340 
population village as well that we got
from<00:03:14.760> him<00:03:14.940> and<00:03:15.240> that<00:03:15.360> awesome<00:03:15.870> guy<00:03:16.050> what<00:03:16.320> he

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
from him and that awesome guy what he

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:17.720 
from him and that awesome guy what he
did<00:03:16.590> was<00:03:16.740> I<00:03:16.890> think<00:03:17.070> this<00:03:17.130> is<00:03:17.280> his<00:03:17.400> spawn

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
did was I think this is his spawn

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.630 
did was I think this is his spawn
village<00:03:18.120> so<00:03:18.570> he<00:03:18.690> spawned<00:03:19.080> over<00:03:19.380> here<00:03:19.650> and<00:03:19.800> he

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
village so he spawned over here and he

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.030 
village so he spawned over here and he
took<00:03:20.880> his<00:03:21.030> village<00:03:21.300> farther<00:03:21.720> out<00:03:21.930> okay<00:03:22.500> that's

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
took his village farther out okay that's

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.500 
took his village farther out okay that's
the<00:03:23.160> strategy<00:03:23.370> I<00:03:23.610> taught<00:03:23.790> you<00:03:24.090> guys<00:03:24.240> you<00:03:24.480> know

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
the strategy I taught you guys you know

I told you guys you can get it outside

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.030 
I told you guys you can get it outside
you<00:03:31.020> know<00:03:31.110> further<00:03:31.440> away<00:03:31.530> from<00:03:31.740> your<00:03:31.860> spawn

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
you know further away from your spawn

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.170 
you know further away from your spawn
that's<00:03:32.250> what<00:03:32.370> a<00:03:32.400> lot<00:03:32.640> of<00:03:32.700> players<00:03:32.940> actually

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
that's what a lot of players actually

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.790 
that's what a lot of players actually
did<00:03:33.480> here<00:03:33.720> that's<00:03:34.110> what<00:03:34.290> some<00:03:34.470> village<00:03:34.710> is

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
did here that's what some village is

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.680 
did here that's what some village is
like<00:03:34.920> 800<00:03:35.130> population<00:03:35.790> right<00:03:36.030> over<00:03:36.240> here<00:03:36.510> and

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
like 800 population right over here and

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.690 
like 800 population right over here and
every<00:03:37.620> other<00:03:37.650> village<00:03:38.100> of<00:03:38.250> the<00:03:38.400> Earth's<00:03:38.550> it's

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
every other village of the Earth's it's

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.160 
every other village of the Earth's it's
like<00:03:38.820> outside<00:03:39.030> of<00:03:39.360> the<00:03:39.420> map<00:03:39.540> so<00:03:39.750> there's<00:03:39.930> no

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
like outside of the map so there's no

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.630 
like outside of the map so there's no
way<00:03:40.320> of<00:03:40.350> him<00:03:40.680> actually<00:03:40.800> defending<00:03:41.520> this

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
way of him actually defending this

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.280 
way of him actually defending this
village<00:03:41.940> because<00:03:42.420> he<00:03:42.630> doesn't<00:03:42.810> have<00:03:42.900> anything

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
village because he doesn't have anything

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.080 
village because he doesn't have anything
around<00:03:43.560> and<00:03:43.890> no<00:03:44.010> cluster<00:03:44.280> know<00:03:44.640> nothing<00:03:44.970> and

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
around and no cluster know nothing and

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.220 
around and no cluster know nothing and
his<00:03:45.210> Alliance<00:03:45.570> wouldn't<00:03:45.780> be<00:03:45.840> able<00:03:45.900> to<00:03:46.080> help

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
his Alliance wouldn't be able to help

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.870 
his Alliance wouldn't be able to help
him<00:03:46.320> within<00:03:46.530> 10<00:03:46.740> seconds<00:03:47.100> of<00:03:47.190> my<00:03:47.340> attacks<00:03:47.580> you

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
him within 10 seconds of my attacks you

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.120 
him within 10 seconds of my attacks you
know<00:03:48.000> so<00:03:48.450> I<00:03:48.480> would<00:03:48.660> just<00:03:48.780> attack<00:03:48.870> him<00:03:49.070> and<00:03:50.070> I

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
know so I would just attack him and I

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:51.380 
know so I would just attack him and I
took<00:03:50.190> it<00:03:50.460> from<00:03:50.550> him<00:03:50.700> and<00:03:50.790> it<00:03:50.880> was<00:03:50.940> a<00:03:51.030> very<00:03:51.150> big

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
took it from him and it was a very big

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:52.580 
took it from him and it was a very big
village<00:03:51.630> because<00:03:51.810> it's<00:03:51.960> his<00:03:52.050> first<00:03:52.230> village

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
village because it's his first village

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.440 
village because it's his first village
so<00:03:52.680> he<00:03:52.740> starts<00:03:52.980> building<00:03:53.220> it<00:03:53.430> up<00:03:53.520> and<00:03:53.790> stuff<00:03:54.000> so

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
so he starts building it up and stuff so

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:55.760 
so he starts building it up and stuff so
it's<00:03:54.570> a<00:03:54.630> very<00:03:54.660> good<00:03:54.990> village<00:03:55.230> and<00:03:55.350> we<00:03:55.440> took<00:03:55.590> it

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:55.770 
it's a very good village and we took it

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.740 
it's a very good village and we took it
so<00:03:56.160> now<00:03:56.280> we're<00:03:56.490> just<00:03:56.520> going<00:03:56.670> for<00:03:56.880> more<00:03:57.210> bigger

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
so now we're just going for more bigger

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.170 
so now we're just going for more bigger
population<00:03:58.410> you<00:03:59.190> know<00:03:59.280> villages<00:03:59.790> so<00:03:59.940> we<00:04:00.060> can

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
population you know villages so we can

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.600
