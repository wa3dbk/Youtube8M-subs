00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:12.230
 good afternoon we are doing the 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.420
 tests with a jeep wrangler rubicon 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:18.599
 2013 model this car comes with a 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:22.290
 v6 3600 engine of 286 horses 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:25.439
 engine power that came from the 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:27.660
 model 2012 onwards is a very 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.050
 powerful very efficient as a test 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.550
 in reverse a metal ramp that has 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:36.790
 98 meters of inclination 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:39.340
 of range hear the engine noise from 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.430
 that I do not pass the 1200 car 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.920
 revolutions per minute 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.650
 until you reach your maximum angle of 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.230
 reverse tilt 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:52.530
 at this moment the car has not been turned on 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.120
 The oil pressure bulb is a 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.080
 cart that is designed for this type 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.120
 of tests all the crankcase oil is 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.430
 goes forward and with everything and that follows 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.840
 lubricant any other car me 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.160
 it would touch to turn it off when the 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.910
 I would have to pay the car for 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.910
 Do not damage the motor 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.000
 at this moment we are going to try the 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.549
 differential locks of this ruby ​​with 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.570
 is the only car in the market that other 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.970
 time 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.820
 Front and rear differential lock 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.440
 I activated it and deactivated it from the cabin 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.650
 they are not automatic locks they are locks 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:30.290
 it is an electro mechanical valve that 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.750
 blocks the car differential in this 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.000
 I will now turn reverse tam 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.759
 tam since I speak blocked differential 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.280
 rear and the front differential me 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:42.920
 I'm going to in first gear I also want 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.280
 reference that in this topo plane 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.710
 of the accelerator in no time 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.320
 I was attending, we took the tire up 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.850
 right to the pebble of the stones very 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.530
 soft 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:58.740
 what do I have to do here to touch the brake 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.740
 no more just because only torque 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.570
 overcome the peak of the stone 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.040
 a rear wheel 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.220
 once we overcome the picacho with the 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.530
 rear wheel I can release the brake stop 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.570
 I remove the differential locks and 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.760
 continue if not remove it because the 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.530
 differential would not let me address 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.030
 You can remove the front and continue with 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.040
 the butt but the locks 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.390
 Differentials always tend to do 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.390
 let the car go in a straight line 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.970
 let's prepare the car we're going to 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.770
 face it to the climb ramp towards 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.050
 forward is a metal ramp of 90 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.270
 degrees of tilt literally from 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:42.230
 climb up a wall at this time not 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:44.440
 I'm going to activate locks since 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.550
 we have the four wheels on the floor 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.980
 I'm just going with double transmission and 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.750
 under each notice that the transfer of 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.019
 this bass charge has a relationship 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:57.160
 from 4 to 1 which is a very powerful relationship 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.160
 as if it were a tractor 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.959
 face the idea that the car is what 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:08.110
 more right possible so that the four 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:11.210
 tires are in the same location and not 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:14.000
 I unbalance the ramp 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.620
 On this ramp, neither did the 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.750
 1,200 revolutions engine 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.850
 1200 at the maximum 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.980
 already reached its limit the limit is that the 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.480
 back man touches the floor if not 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.710
 it would continue to rise without any problem 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.710
 we put reverse 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:33.820
 let's make the ramp without any problem 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.820
 we go in reverse we 're going to do the 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.630
 differential lock test 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.100
 differential begin to work in the 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.500
 moment we have 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.510
 I need it when the tires no longer 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.640
 I have two tires in the air or one 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.400
 rim in the air is when I need the 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.780
 differential lock rim rim 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.320
 that is in the air which is also the 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.480
 that is badly supported fire in the air is 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.310
 the one that starts skating at that moment 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.100
 the car loses its momentum towards 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.660
 go ahead I'll go there and learn the 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.450
 blocks but does not place third block 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.400
 forward loose the brake is not going to be 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.780
 neither crossed the direct to the right 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.000
 to prevent him from hitting the bomber against 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:13.500
 the loose stone the brake and the car 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.500
 go up without touching the accelerator 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:26.379
 here we can see the inclination in that 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.970
 we are and we would still be missing in 30 

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:30.490
 degrees to start thinking that we 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.530
 let's turn it into a very stable car 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:36.690
 a car with the very wide trail 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.690
 with the center of gravity very low 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.480
 at this moment I'm going to put reverse I'm going 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.250
 to let it pick up momentum and I'm going to 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.290
 slow down the moment the car is going to 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.860
 balance I have the front tire of 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.110
 chanel 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:49.360
 well supported from the back well supported 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.240
 the back right in the air and the 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.730
 Front left with 60% support 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.520
 when I brake that goes on balance on 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:59.230
 two wheels and the car swings in 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.570
 this time I have the right tire 

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:03.280
 leaning the right front the third 

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.110
 left supported 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.880
 right rear and left front 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.100
 practically in the air 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.930
 this is the job the blockades we have 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:14.350
 we are supported on two wheels and the 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:16.240
 advance car could be supported in a 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.650
 rim and three in the air and the car 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.100
 continues to advance through the blockades of 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.100
 differential 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:27.940
 Like the one below, we let the rim 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:29.350
 gently fall back to the floor once 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:30.430
 that the rear tire falls only the 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.170
 curupe floor the address of the 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.610
 right 

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:36.480
 the idea is that the name of the car is not 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:41.340
 knock 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:44.090
 and this is the wrangler rubicon is ready 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.090
 a carrazo
