00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
much in the improvement the only thing

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.590 
much in the improvement the only thing
was<00:01:14.970> fixed<00:01:15.390> was<00:01:15.799> the<00:01:16.799> camera<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:18.409> yellow<00:01:19.409> and

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
was fixed was the camera and yellow and

was fixed was the camera and yellow and
the<00:01:21.600> user<00:01:21.810> interface<00:01:22.020> it's<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.590> bit<00:01:22.740> different

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
the user interface it's a bit different

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.420 
the user interface it's a bit different
lock<00:01:24.210> screen<00:01:24.360> is<00:01:24.689> all<00:01:24.840> different<00:01:25.259> now<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.070> get

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
lock screen is all different now you get

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.660 
lock screen is all different now you get
like<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.820> one<00:01:27.049> simple<00:01:28.049> open<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.619> 10.2<00:01:29.280> sorry

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
like the one simple open to 10.2 sorry

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.440 
like the one simple open to 10.2 sorry
so<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:30.720> get<00:01:30.840> these<00:01:30.930> options<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:32.090> weather<00:01:33.090> up

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
so you get these options and weather up

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.710 
so you get these options and weather up
here<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:34.250> multiple<00:01:35.250> widgets<00:01:35.400> endless<00:01:36.060> quicks

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
here and multiple widgets endless quicks

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.920 
here and multiple widgets endless quicks
like<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.079> cameras<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:37.680> see<00:01:38.810> also<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:39.900> just

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
like the cameras you see also you just

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.460 
like the cameras you see also you just
all<00:01:40.320> stages<00:01:40.979> all<00:01:41.130> of<00:01:41.310> them<00:01:41.460> still<00:01:41.670> works<00:01:42.409> so<00:01:43.409> i

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
all stages all of them still works so i

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.679 
all stages all of them still works so i
can<00:01:43.619> add<00:01:43.770> some<00:01:43.950> more<00:01:44.130> than<00:01:44.369> one<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:45.390> i<00:01:45.450> have<00:01:45.570> to

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
can add some more than one and i have to

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:54.380 
can add some more than one and i have to
unlock<00:01:47.270> and<00:01:50.149> that's<00:01:51.149> about<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:53.240> temple<00:01:54.240> 1<00:01:54.360> by

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.069 
unlock and that's about the temple 1 by
3<00:01:54.920> so<00:01:55.920> that's<00:01:56.729> not<00:01:56.939> much<00:01:57.180> difference<00:01:57.659> but<00:01:57.869> like

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079
