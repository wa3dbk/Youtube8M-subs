you to dual wield two desert Eagles

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:19.969 
you to dual wield two desert Eagles
which<00:03:18.329> inhibits<00:03:18.810> your<00:03:18.930> ability<00:03:18.989> to<00:03:19.530> end<00:03:19.739> our

sites but grant you the extra firepower
makes<00:03:22.349> you<00:03:22.470> more<00:03:22.620> deadly<00:03:23.040> at<00:03:23.159> close<00:03:23.400> ranges

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
makes you more deadly at close ranges

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.420 
makes you more deadly at close ranges
because<00:03:24.750> of<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:24.959> high<00:03:25.139> recoil<00:03:25.650> the<00:03:25.949> akimbo

attachment<00:03:27.000> can<00:03:27.180> come<00:03:27.359> in<00:03:27.449> handy<00:03:27.629> and<00:03:28.229> that

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
attachment can come in handy and that

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.740 
attachment can come in handy and that
because<00:03:28.709> you<00:03:28.829> need<00:03:28.949> two<00:03:29.189> shots<00:03:29.549> to<00:03:29.699> kill<00:03:30.000> when

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.469 
often just fire out one shot from each
weapon<00:03:34.560> rather<00:03:35.430> than<00:03:35.639> risk<00:03:35.879> missing<00:03:36.180> your

the attachment there's not quite as

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.059 
the attachment there's not quite as
useful<00:03:42.269> but<00:03:43.049> does<00:03:43.259> make<00:03:43.409> your<00:03:43.560> character

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
useful but does make your character

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:45.740 
useful but does make your character
model<00:03:44.340> look<00:03:44.489> much<00:03:44.699> more<00:03:44.909> cooler<00:03:45.209> is<00:03:45.540> the

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
model look much more cooler is the

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.689 
model look much more cooler is the
tactical<00:03:46.229> knife<00:03:46.439> if<00:03:47.099> you're<00:03:47.310> running<00:03:47.430> around

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:47.699 
tactical knife if you're running around

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:49.610 
tactical knife if you're running around
and<00:03:48.000> using<00:03:48.359> the<00:03:48.419> desert<00:03:48.720> eagle<00:03:48.840> as<00:03:49.079> a<00:03:49.109> primary

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
and using the desert eagle as a primary

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.319 
and using the desert eagle as a primary
weapon<00:03:49.769> then<00:03:50.430> the<00:03:50.549> tactical<00:03:50.970> knife<00:03:51.120> is

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
weapon then the tactical knife is

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:52.879 
weapon then the tactical knife is
probably<00:03:51.599> more<00:03:51.810> worthwhile<00:03:52.019> than<00:03:52.530> having<00:03:52.769> no

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:52.889 
probably more worthwhile than having no

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:55.069 
probably more worthwhile than having no
attachments<00:03:53.489> at<00:03:53.549> all<00:03:53.729> so<00:03:54.269> you<00:03:54.329> can<00:03:54.599> use<00:03:54.810> that

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
attachments at all so you can use that

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.020 
attachments at all so you can use that
faster<00:03:55.500> melee<00:03:55.829> in<00:03:56.280> case<00:03:56.519> you've<00:03:56.699> exhausted

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
faster melee in case you've exhausted
