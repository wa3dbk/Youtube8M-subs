00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.970
 and we are already here for the 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.700
 third step of interest which is called 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.190
 I called it get the pomegranates 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.840
 new napa grenades the stands 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.309
 of bombing you can call it as 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.470
 you want to apply all the steps 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.839
 to get these grenades first to 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.249
 beginning of the game if you come here to 

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:22.259
 the room of the second generator that is 

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:24.419
 next door and each player has to catch 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:27.029
 a stone fishing and stones on top of the 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:28.890
 table then you give to the x and you catch them 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.779
 it's worth once you've done that 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.660
 you have to go to church here go to 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.059
 this kind of source of blessed 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.920
 baptize me I know what the fuck is that and you 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.710
 We give the X or square and place 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.449
 the stone there you see how each player in 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.550
 this case we were four because we have to 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:47.550
 place all the stones worth seven 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.690
 step you have to kill with your fists to the side 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.129
 from the source you still do not know how 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.050
 get fists because there are simply 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.909
 have to fill the four arms trunks of 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.199
 zombies that are all over the map if you still 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:58.019
 you do not know where they are then when I say it 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.059
 in a moment the first one is still at 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:03.390
 leave the mansion the second trunk is 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.409
 next to resistance plus another trunk 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.810
 is 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.670
 behind the titan in the back and 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.679
 another trunk is next to the stairs 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.719
 where you climb alpaca boots is very 

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:14.250
 near you is good once 

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:16.170
 we have taken the reward we go to a 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.520
 living room the sixth generator or the 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.799
 first box that is in the laboratory 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.079
 we take the reward of the fists that 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.030
 kind of flare and we see that kill 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:25.619
 zombies with your fists in this source 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.849
 I was here doing just because 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.679
 we thought that with a player that 

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:31.229
 had the napalm bombs was worth but 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:33.590
 do not make them all make faces or do 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.209
 the four players the challenge because 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.099
 it's like that list you're worth it will come a 

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:40.439
 moment that the source does not eat more 

00:01:38.099 --> 00:01:42.929
 souls we will have to take the stone and 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.219
 transport it to the place from which we have 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:45.989
 brought you remember the table of the 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:48.030
 so we'll have to take it and 

00:01:45.989 --> 00:01:50.670
 transported to transport it to that place 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.060
 but you have seen the stone how it has 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.849
 cracked has broken this what does it mean to me 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.729
 It was quite difficult to see what was happening 

00:01:56.849 --> 00:02:01.079
 you have to take the stone from the fountain 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.340
 there you see how the cone is going to change 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.649
 above the rounds and under the 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.879
 advantages is totally clean as the 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.399
 you have to take to the table 

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:10.679
 principle without touching anything at all 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.490
 mud mud that makes you slow down 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.340
 OK 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.750
 you have to follow this route that I'm going 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.100
 to follow me then you have to 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.590
 try stepping on all tables 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.870
 wood all the piles that there are and of 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.710
 this way get to the room at 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.080
 beginning stones 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.940
 without touching anything of mud because as you 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.350
 I say that is going to break the stone and you go 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.730
 to have to go back to the source of 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.250
 Samantha principle is going to tell you that 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.200
 you start again and then you have nothing 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.520
 try again it is said is this is 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.550
 a unique journey that can be followed 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.380
 because the other way there is already mud and 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.820
 you can not do everything in any way 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.230
 there is no danger here, I know if there are 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.880
 have to hit this jump but when I 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.560
 hit just in case and since then when 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.450
 we go down the stairs this is ground 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.380
 normal stone therefore does not run 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.970
 there is no danger and because this is the 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.820
 door is picco is the opposite to go 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:59.500
 to the second generator we go here here 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.060
 we hit this jump that I do not know if it is 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.280
 really necessary I think not but 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.320
 well that you stick it in case there's 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.930
 Samantha talking to us like a slut whore 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.640
 that never shut up and well yes we have 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.770
 transported the clean stone the 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.270
 we put back on the table is there 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.180
 what to do now then we have to go back to 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:20.680
 kill zombies in this table you remember the 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:22.180
 we've taken this table to the source those 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.430
 we have recharged them because we have 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.380
 here totally clean and we return them to 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.900
 recharge until you give us this kind 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.160
 of grenade bombardment paper that 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.720
 it works to attract 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.700
 zombie starts throwing a bombing 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:35.590
 incredible where he has brought them so 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.180
 good people do this step at 4 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.550
 players all have the bombs of 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.110
 napalm remember that without dying you go to 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.000
 lose the bombs but good what 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.710
 important is that you have taken the step 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.460
 of the stones so we have 7 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.460
 good bye
