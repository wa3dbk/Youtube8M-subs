00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.900
 help for you here butt beach 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.720

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:25.050
 same creator of the clash of classical 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.539
 bringing the channel a lot now and bubka me 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:32.180
 I'm enjoying it and I waited a little bit easy. 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:35.340
 has small differences compared to the 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:38.160
 alcohol gel fans that is what here the 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.680
 People only have one gala builder in the clash 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.420
 of when you can have five he is 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.160
 still has this superficial limitation 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.829
 said it did not intend to launch new 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.110
 consultants for him and he's fine. 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.340
 evolved system has system clans 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.070
 of war 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.110
 I just did not see the chat system since 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.750
 so worth thinking about making lobby 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.969
 His graphic game is fine too. 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:04.559
 beautiful can give a general mistress and 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:07.200
 For my zeal for my island here. 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.180
 and there's a lot of stuff like that here 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.939
 when would the locksmith in the case 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.220
 she produces 2 wood 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.909
 we have a mortar that is similar to that of 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.729
 clash 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.350
 here we have this radar that radar that is 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.479
 very important the guys because he who 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.500
 will define something you can see the 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.380
 new map 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.270
 he has to be always well how 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.310
 speak about who is well evolved 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.159
 always always has to be our new cd 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.700
 so the sniper gang here another 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.110
 It has to evolve, but I have no money. 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.430
 headquarters here to release some of the 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.119
 troops and such 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.890
 In case here at an invitation you attacked the 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.390
 headquarters was already 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.189
 we have our troops here, we do not have the 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.020
 pioneer who is kind of shopping mall only 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.780
 thigh already has it since the first cam 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.219
 You do not have to block the attack, I will. 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.399
 show why the system of 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.930
 only to point out that you need to 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:05.140
 Mouth probably attack me in the galley 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:10.000
 ah I think that date I do not know if it is 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:11.500
 this one that I could part to move to this 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.270
 from the pataca leaves the first 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.920
 show you a map is this one 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:19.030
 You can see that there's a lot to 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:22.260
 liberal here only releases with money and I 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:25.930
 I only got this part because I am and 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.970
 I updated my radar that is very 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.520
 important that they came back to you 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.230
 The island is the one that everyone said 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.810
 are trees people are leading which 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.400
 expand which has trees that 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:41.410
 I can not take time because Daniel 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:43.959
 move there level 5 and so on 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:49.300
 here's a difference here is this here is 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:51.640
 buteo buteo and this is the player 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.010
 I can already see players already after attacking 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:57.040
 three, but the man was either involved or 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.230
 an error risk my sister my 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.920
 gunboat had strong and attacked the 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.940
 his base now come on we 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.860
 to observe here again the essence of here 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.660
 Even this one I'm going to attack to show 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.170
 For you, how does the system work? 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:13.989
 attack of the game to which I will stay here. 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:17.950
 mechanics in my gunboat I go 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:20.230
 destroy or try to destroy this entrance 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:24.190
 You can see that he spends 11 trekinho 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:29.620
 line is the attack points if you do not 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:32.170
 have them you can not attack 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.820
 use only with your partner, I will 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:43.470
 use them and every single thing that I am 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:43.470
 in government to the small g-4 bug on the screen 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:54.000
 Here I am, I'm watching her. 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:54.000
