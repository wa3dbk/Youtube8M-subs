00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:06.930
 well I'll show you 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:10.290
 what is the knot that you told me that 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.590
 I did not understand if it turned or not as I say 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:17.430
 the pair of bobbins is the same thread 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:20.760
 half in each bolillo 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.850
 if you notice you do not turn it does not fall because 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.150
 you have the knot you put it in all the 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.150
 Chile 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:31.670
 this is the knot you can open 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.660
 you realize this is the date 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:45.879
 you are going to open your fingers and put it in 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.879
 the tours 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.120
 again it does not fall 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:57.620
 but if I need thread 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.360
 all I do is turn 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:03.840
 and it is giving me thread 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:06.990
 I squeeze it and it does not fall 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.870
 same if I need 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:15.410
 if the knot loosens 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:15.410
 I can turn it to put thread 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:26.140
 I'm not turning 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:30.870
 and goes into the open when already was the 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.870
 size that I want I close it 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.820
 and the war 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:40.410
 this was the doubt about the knot now 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:43.110
 let's start the half point the middle 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:45.150
 point remember that it does not matter what 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:50.630
 stitch be when that start you start 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:55.520
 with twist 12 the stitch begins 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:58.970
 back crossing this is all the half point 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.079
 there is a triangle at the base of 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.320
 pin 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:09.369
 I do a side guide me I owe it to 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:12.420
 Take care of the start of the new crossing 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.420
 and I leave the pair 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.140
 back crossing 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.469
 back crossing 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.610
 back cross 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:36.300
 and I put my bobbins 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.300
 how will you see the step guide 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.190
 but here what you have to be careful 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:47.870
 is that the guide 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:47.870
 half of it passes only one thread is left 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.780
 that's why when it's colors you have to 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.930
 review very well why it is staying in 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:59.030
 diagonal 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:01.140
 we start again now with the torch on 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.030
 one 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.940
 two 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.540
 in some stitches up to three turns 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:13.959
 he should be given 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:16.500
 and we started the stitch turned cross and 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.500
 he left the bread 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.090
 as the one who does 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:26.730
 back crossing 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.870
 in the guide that was left in the 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.870
 shore will return 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.050
 back crossing 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:41.159
 back crossing here is my guide 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.400
 return 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.240
 cross 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.880
 and I'm coming back 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.260
 to its original this is the original with 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.709
 this 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:59.040
 this fixed there are some x is a point 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:04.350
 open 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:07.150
 the half point and I'm going to put my pin 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:10.630
 now I return 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:14.330
 as you will see here is missing and what 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:18.530
 I do not want a little bit and that's it 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:23.739
 I start again with twist 12 and 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.739
 I start the stitch turn back 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.690
 back cross 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:35.890
 back cross 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.650
 back cross 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.930
 It is very important to see that silos do not 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:51.280
 stay at the time of lowering the bolillo 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:51.280
 do not twist but be aligned 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:05:04.849
 again turn cross and already my guide 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:08.569
 back here again I expose my pin 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:08.569
 taking the two threads 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:17.940
 you are staying accommodating 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.940
 this is the half point
