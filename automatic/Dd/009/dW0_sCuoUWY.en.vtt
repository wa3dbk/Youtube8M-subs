00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:30.509 
know basically you like flip it out and
stuff<00:02:25.510> to<00:02:27.450> mix<00:02:28.450> it<00:02:28.630> up<00:02:28.690> like<00:02:28.989> see<00:02:29.799> i'll<00:02:30.190> try<00:02:30.459> to

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
stuff to mix it up like see i'll try to

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:36.720 
stuff to mix it up like see i'll try to
mix<00:02:30.730> it<00:02:30.880> up<00:02:30.970> here<00:02:31.739> like<00:02:32.739> that<00:02:33.040> and<00:02:33.600> then<00:02:35.730> that's

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
mix it up here like that and then that's

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:45.720 
mix it up here like that and then that's
it<00:02:36.880> won't<00:02:37.060> get<00:02:38.880> that's<00:02:39.880> just<00:02:40.030> weird

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.839 

anyway<00:02:46.730> this<00:02:47.239> thing<00:02:47.450> is<00:02:47.599> really<00:02:47.840> really<00:02:48.140> stiff

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
anyway this thing is really really stiff

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:53.649 
anyway this thing is really really stiff
and<00:02:50.500> I<00:02:51.549> don't<00:02:52.549> want<00:02:52.670> to<00:02:52.730> see<00:02:52.909> it<00:02:53.030> feels<00:02:53.299> cheap

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:53.659 
and I don't want to see it feels cheap

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:56.649 
and I don't want to see it feels cheap
but<00:02:54.110> it<00:02:54.200> feels<00:02:54.319> a<00:02:54.470> little<00:02:54.590> bit<00:02:54.830> cheap<00:02:55.659> but

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:56.659 
but it feels a little bit cheap but

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:02.550 
but it feels a little bit cheap but
these<00:02:56.810> are<00:02:56.930> just<00:02:57.049> my<00:02:57.170> first<00:02:57.470> impressions<00:02:58.810> I

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.259 

have<00:03:03.560> noticed<00:03:03.950> that<00:03:04.040> when<00:03:04.610> you<00:03:04.730> try<00:03:04.910> to<00:03:04.940> flip

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
have noticed that when you try to flip

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:06.940 
have noticed that when you try to flip
it<00:03:05.330> you<00:03:05.660> have<00:03:05.900> to<00:03:06.049> make<00:03:06.200> sure<00:03:06.230> that<00:03:06.590> it's<00:03:06.739> like

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
it you have to make sure that it's like

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:15.900 
it you have to make sure that it's like
perfectly<00:03:07.790> lined<00:03:08.120> or<00:03:08.390> won't<00:03:08.660> flip<00:03:08.900> crazily

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:26.259 

like<00:03:16.910> so<00:03:23.980> there<00:03:24.980> that's<00:03:25.370> mixing<00:03:25.879> it<00:03:26.030> up<00:03:26.120> a

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
like so there that's mixing it up a

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:31.539 
like so there that's mixing it up a
little<00:03:26.420> bit<00:03:26.660> more<00:03:29.650> i'll<00:03:30.650> post<00:03:30.980> a<00:03:31.099> review<00:03:31.250> this

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
little bit more i'll post a review this

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.750 
little bit more i'll post a review this
puzzle<00:03:31.940> later<00:03:32.200> but<00:03:33.200> anyway<00:03:33.530> that's<00:03:34.280> the<00:03:34.489> brain

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
puzzle later but anyway that's the brain

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.089 
puzzle later but anyway that's the brain
twist<00:03:35.470> and<00:03:36.940> it's<00:03:38.590> it's<00:03:39.590> kind<00:03:39.920> of<00:03:39.950> like<00:03:40.040> a

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:40.099 
twist and it's it's kind of like a

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:43.569 
twist and it's it's kind of like a
pyramid<00:03:41.260> because<00:03:42.260> it<00:03:42.470> like<00:03:42.680> rotates<00:03:43.489> like

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:43.579 
pyramid because it like rotates like

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:46.960 
pyramid because it like rotates like
this<00:03:44.590> like<00:03:45.590> the<00:03:45.709> painting<00:03:45.950> stuff<00:03:46.220> but<00:03:46.730> it<00:03:46.849> has

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
this like the painting stuff but it has

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.259 
this like the painting stuff but it has
this<00:03:47.090> weird<00:03:47.329> like<00:03:47.629> little<00:03:47.900> flipping<00:03:48.319> action

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
this weird like little flipping action

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:51.640 
this weird like little flipping action
that<00:03:50.269> takes<00:03:50.450> you<00:03:50.690> to<00:03:50.750> like<00:03:50.989> different<00:03:51.349> colors

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
that takes you to like different colors

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.170 
that takes you to like different colors
and<00:03:53.290> I<00:03:54.290> guess<00:03:54.500> that's<00:03:54.739> how<00:03:54.889> you<00:03:54.950> like<00:03:55.220> these

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
and I guess that's how you like these

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.360 
and I guess that's how you like these
rotate<00:03:56.690> right<00:03:56.810> here<00:03:57.079> and<00:03:57.260> like<00:03:57.889> in<00:03:58.069> order<00:03:58.190> to

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
rotate right here and like in order to

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:59.920 
rotate right here and like in order to
get<00:03:58.489> that<00:03:58.669> one<00:03:58.790> from<00:03:58.910> here<00:03:59.150> to<00:03:59.239> here<00:03:59.450> I<00:03:59.660> guess

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
get that one from here to here I guess

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.180 
get that one from here to here I guess
the<00:04:00.139> only<00:04:00.230> ways<00:04:00.500> to<00:04:00.530> like<00:04:01.569> flip<00:04:02.569> it<00:04:02.840> and<00:04:03.200> let<00:04:04.099> me

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
the only ways to like flip it and let me

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.400 
the only ways to like flip it and let me
try<00:04:04.340> something<00:04:04.760> like<00:04:05.019> let's<00:04:06.019> say<00:04:06.079> I<00:04:06.169> want<00:04:06.349> to

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
try something like let's say I want to

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.339 
try something like let's say I want to
get<00:04:06.500> that<00:04:06.650> from<00:04:06.859> there<00:04:07.069> there<00:04:07.419> I'll<00:04:08.419> do<00:04:09.200> the

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:09.349 
get that from there there I'll do the

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:14.890 
get that from there there I'll do the
like<00:04:09.530> little<00:04:10.519> flip<00:04:10.880> thing<00:04:12.549> and<00:04:13.549> then<00:04:13.900> rotate

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
like little flip thing and then rotate

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.960 
like little flip thing and then rotate
it<00:04:15.079> maybe<00:04:16.750> or<00:04:17.750> something<00:04:17.780> I<00:04:18.519> open<00:04:19.519> it<00:04:19.609> back<00:04:19.760> up

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
it maybe or something I open it back up
