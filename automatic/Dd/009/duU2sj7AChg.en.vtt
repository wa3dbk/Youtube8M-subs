would<00:00:44.280> let<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.520> know<00:00:44.550> about<00:00:44.790> it<00:00:45.060> he<00:00:45.180> likes<00:00:45.390> to

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
would let you know about it he likes to

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.790 
would let you know about it he likes to
run<00:00:45.690> his<00:00:45.809> mouth<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:46.020> little<00:00:46.230> bit<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.590> that<00:00:46.680> was

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
run his mouth a little bit and that was

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.620 
run his mouth a little bit and that was
kind<00:00:46.980> of<00:00:47.100> part<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.730> award<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.210> him<00:00:48.360> as<00:00:48.480> he

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:48.630 
kind of part of the award of him as he

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.210 
kind of part of the award of him as he
talked<00:00:48.870> it<00:00:49.050> but<00:00:49.230> he<00:00:49.290> also<00:00:49.410> backed<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:49.829> up<00:00:49.920> well

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:50.220 
talked it but he also backed it up well

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.650 
talked it but he also backed it up well
but<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:50.399> think<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.730> difference<00:00:50.940> with<00:00:51.239> Shannon

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
but I think the difference with Shannon

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.569 
but I think the difference with Shannon
Sharpe<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:52.079> it<00:00:52.230> wasn't<00:00:52.530> so<00:00:52.710> much<00:00:52.860> ego<00:00:53.370> it

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
Sharpe is it wasn't so much ego it

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.580 
Sharpe is it wasn't so much ego it
wasn't<00:00:53.940> so<00:00:54.059> much<00:00:54.210> self<00:00:54.510> gratification<00:00:54.899> he

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
wasn't so much self gratification he

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.860 
wasn't so much self gratification he
also<00:00:55.770> sometimes<00:00:56.460> got<00:00:56.700> got<00:00:57.059> tainted<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.630> little

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
also sometimes got got tainted a little

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.750 
also sometimes got got tainted a little
bit<00:00:57.989> by<00:00:58.110> his<00:00:58.230> brother<00:00:58.530> sterling<00:00:58.829> who<00:00:59.370> was<00:00:59.550> also

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
bit by his brother sterling who was also

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.030

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.359 
friendly as a matter of fact was a very
sullen<00:01:03.660> guy<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.229> Shannon<00:01:04.769> was<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.979> opposite

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
sullen guy and Shannon was the opposite

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.039 
sullen guy and Shannon was the opposite
Shannon<00:01:05.759> was<00:01:05.850> very<00:01:06.060> approachable<00:01:06.359> is<00:01:06.749> very

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
Shannon was very approachable is very

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.830 
Shannon was very approachable is very
approachable<00:01:07.380> good<00:01:08.130> guy<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.999> yeah<00:01:09.299> he<00:01:09.539> talked

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
approachable good guy and yeah he talked

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.270 
approachable good guy and yeah he talked
a<00:01:09.990> lot<00:01:10.139> but<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.469> was<00:01:10.499> always<00:01:10.740> in<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:11.009> fun<00:01:11.249> and

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
a lot but it was always in a fun and

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.219 
a lot but it was always in a fun and
positive<00:01:11.579> way<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.149> so<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:12.840> thought<00:01:13.170> that

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
positive way and so I thought that

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.739 
positive way and so I thought that
actually<00:01:13.709> added<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.219> his<00:01:14.369> his<00:01:14.850> impact<00:01:15.389> on<00:01:15.630> the

00:01:15.739 --> 00:01:15.749 
actually added to his his impact on the

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:17.120 
actually added to his his impact on the
game<00:01:15.929> and<00:01:15.990> when<00:01:16.319> you<00:01:16.439> get<00:01:16.590> back<00:01:16.799> on<00:01:17.009> the

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
game and when you get back on the

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.279 
game and when you get back on the
football<00:01:17.520> field<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.880> try<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.209> find<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.659> guy<00:01:18.810> in

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:19.289 
football field you try and find a guy in

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:21.019 
football field you try and find a guy in
