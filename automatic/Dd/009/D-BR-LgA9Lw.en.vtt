what what is actually going on to cause

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.639 
what what is actually going on to cause
the<00:00:34.980> poem<00:00:35.390> it's<00:00:36.390> actually<00:00:36.750> very<00:00:36.780> natural<00:00:37.440> to

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
the poem it's actually very natural to

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.310 
the poem it's actually very natural to
open<00:00:38.370> in<00:00:38.460> such<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.670> way<00:00:38.879> that<00:00:38.910> that<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:39.870> cover

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
open in such a way that that you cover

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.940 
open in such a way that that you cover
that<00:00:40.680> you<00:00:41.399> cover<00:00:41.640> up<00:00:41.850> those<00:00:42.030> those<00:00:42.420> areas<00:00:43.170> just

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
that you cover up those those areas just

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.190 
that you cover up those those areas just
by<00:00:44.129> seeing<00:00:44.190> that<00:00:44.539> sewing<00:00:45.539> on<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.780> phone<00:00:45.989> that

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
by seeing that sewing on the phone that

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.910 
by seeing that sewing on the phone that
just<00:00:46.500> happens<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:46.950> look<00:00:47.160> no<00:00:47.520> reception<00:00:48.030> ok<00:00:48.920> so

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
just happens and look no reception ok so

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.709 
just happens and look no reception ok so
I<00:00:50.250> think<00:00:50.489> just<00:00:51.059> by<00:00:51.239> covering<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.739> lines<00:00:53.039> here

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 
I think just by covering the lines here

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:56.810 
I think just by covering the lines here
sorry<00:00:54.719> right<00:00:54.899> here<00:00:55.170> what<00:00:56.129> like<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:56.699> know

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
sorry right here what like you know

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.639 
sorry right here what like you know
connecting<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.449> two<00:00:57.750> metal<00:00:57.989> bars<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.530> is

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
connecting the two metal bars that is

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.119 
connecting the two metal bars that is
separated<00:00:59.010> by<00:00:59.070> that<00:00:59.280> black<00:00:59.489> line<00:01:00.379> by<00:01:01.379> covering

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
separated by that black line by covering

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.219 
separated by that black line by covering
that<00:01:02.309> together<00:01:02.719> it's<00:01:03.719> creating<00:01:04.140> the

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
that together it's creating the

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.880 
that together it's creating the
reception<00:01:04.680> issue<00:01:04.799> okay<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.570> do<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.710> cover

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
reception issue okay and to do to cover

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.609 
reception issue okay and to do to cover
both<00:01:08.130> lines<00:01:08.490> on<00:01:09.270> both<00:01:09.450> sides<00:01:09.930> makes<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.500> issue

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
both lines on both sides makes the issue

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.580 
both lines on both sides makes the issue
even<00:01:10.830> worse<00:01:11.100> that's<00:01:11.880> that's<00:01:12.240> what<00:01:12.450> I'm

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
even worse that's that's what I'm

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.920 
even worse that's that's what I'm
understanding<00:01:14.210> the<00:01:15.210> second<00:01:15.509> thing<00:01:15.659> is<00:01:15.840> I

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
understanding the second thing is I

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.990 
understanding the second thing is I
wanted<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.229> see<00:01:16.380> if<00:01:16.409> this<00:01:17.400> I<00:01:17.549> haven't<00:01:17.820> tried

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.160 
know I wonder if just keeping a spacer
between<00:01:42.370> my<00:01:42.700> fingers<00:01:42.760> and<00:01:43.240> that<00:01:43.510> line<00:01:43.810> of<00:01:43.840> the

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
between my fingers and that line of the

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.530 
between my fingers and that line of the
two<00:01:44.350> metal<00:01:44.650> antennas<00:01:45.250> if<00:01:45.970> that<00:01:46.210> makes<00:01:46.420> an

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
two metal antennas if that makes an

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.590 
two metal antennas if that makes an
issue<00:01:46.690> in<00:01:46.870> the<00:01:46.960> reception<00:01:47.760> so<00:01:48.760> this<00:01:49.390> is<00:01:49.420> the

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
the antennas separate i'm just going to

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.780 
the antennas separate i'm just going to
hold<00:02:32.650> it<00:02:32.740> there<00:02:32.950> and<00:02:33.580> show<00:02:33.730> you<00:02:33.790> what<00:02:33.940> happens

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
just about holding it there my reception

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:46.700 
just about holding it there my reception
should<00:02:39.700> start<00:02:40.000> dropping<00:02:40.530> and<00:02:42.120> it's<00:02:43.120> dropping

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:52.380 

and<00:02:47.040> it's<00:02:47.490> dropping

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.010 

so<00:02:53.390> yeah<00:02:53.660> I<00:02:53.810> think<00:02:53.870> I<00:02:54.530> think<00:02:54.980> I<00:02:55.010> made<00:02:55.160> my<00:02:55.190> point

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
so yeah I think I think I made my point

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.810 
so yeah I think I think I made my point
that<00:02:57.020> I<00:02:57.290> believe<00:02:57.590> that<00:02:57.620> is<00:02:57.920> the<00:02:57.950> issue<00:02:58.160> so<00:02:58.610> and

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
that I believe that is the issue so and

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.750 
that I believe that is the issue so and
I<00:02:58.880> think<00:02:59.210> if<00:02:59.420> you<00:02:59.540> have<00:02:59.750> a<00:02:59.780> case<00:03:00.250> that<00:03:01.250> is<00:03:01.340> you

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:01.760 
I think if you have a case that is you

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.090 
I think if you have a case that is you
know<00:03:01.790> making<00:03:02.060> sure<00:03:02.150> that<00:03:02.510> you<00:03:03.230> know<00:03:03.260> something

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
know making sure that you know something

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.920 
know making sure that you know something
that<00:03:04.250> something<00:03:04.880> that<00:03:05.090> you<00:03:05.570> know<00:03:05.660> like<00:03:05.810> the

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.430 
human figure that carries an electrical

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.150 
human figure that carries an electrical
charge<00:03:07.460> will<00:03:07.940> not<00:03:08.060> connect<00:03:08.330> the<00:03:08.420> two<00:03:09.160> antennas

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
charge will not connect the two antennas

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.620
