 have infinite special abilities 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.780
 to have also infinite money in the 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.550
 gta 5 in the individual mode and this is not 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.230
 for pirate play all for all for 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.940
 all plays both pirates and ones 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.460
 pirates vale 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.719
 what you will have to do will be download 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.090
 a program that I will leave the description 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:48.850

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.949
 per mega so it is downloaded and fast and 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.550
 once we have downloaded it I will 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:54.469
 I have here 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.850
 it would be this once we have it 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.500
 downloaded what we will have to do is 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.449
 go to take pendrive and we will put it in the 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.430
 play when you 're in the wide and we 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.110
 we go saved data tools and 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.750
 we go the option of gta 5 that puts 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.880
 self-saved then we take we give to 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.619
 triangle and we copy it to the pendrive a 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.619
 Once we copied it, we took it out and we 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:15.619
 we go to the computer we put it in a 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:18.200
 usb plug and we already come to the 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.930
 then once the program is 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.680
 we are in the folder we get into the 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:28.189
 gta of 562 we go to fidel open folder 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:33.060
 and we go where the pendrive is 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:35.310
 what would I have it here in ps3 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:40.110
 he is that this would be the play of the gta 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.850
 it affects then once we have loaded the 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.080
 bleu is worth me for example here already what 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:49.220
 I have everything modified 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:52.340
 for us it we will 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.720
 without anything or it will not come out as such 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.230
 we have it for example it will come out in this 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.910
 barrel depends on each one as we have 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:02.000
 advanced by us so many things will come out 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:05.610
 here we will have to put him in the three 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:10.560
 always the money is always worth 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:13.500
 the money for example we will create 999 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.990
 million and 999 million here would be the 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.470
 shooting or speed and skill 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:22.220
 special always to the maximum that of flying 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.450
 you know so that our players 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.570
 franklin michael and three boxes so be 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.220
 pretty good and good once there 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.630
 modified if you do not want metals so much 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.700
 money for the mind and less what each 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.560
 one needs and good once already 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.720
 let's have what we have to do is 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.660
 go to give it file this good folder 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.340
 sorry to this one that you never touch it worth 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.680
 and once we have it all modified 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.569
 what we have to do is give phil 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:49.879
 and we give 6 to 6 we give 6 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:52.040
 We waited a bit and once they have 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:53.569
 removed we closed it then once 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.599
 is closed what we should do 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:59.239
 is to take the pendrive to place it in 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:01.030
 the play and we give it we go again to 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.849
 saved data tools 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.260
 selection we selected this time first 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:09.079
 the pendrive as is our pendrive 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.480
 for example kingston a brand of 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:17.870
 pendrive then we select if that brand 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:20.599
 and we copy the 6 data from the pendrive 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:23.390
 to bs 3 then once we get 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:24.680
 we will have all the money and all the 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.280
 things that we have not put with all 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.590
