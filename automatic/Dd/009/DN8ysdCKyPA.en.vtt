studying those stem cells in the brain
with<00:00:35.229> the<00:00:35.319> hope<00:00:35.499> that<00:00:35.530> someday<00:00:35.890> those<00:00:36.249> cells

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
with the hope that someday those cells

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.119 
with the hope that someday those cells
may<00:00:36.819> provide<00:00:37.239> treatments<00:00:37.929> for<00:00:38.649> things<00:00:38.920> such

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:39.129 
may provide treatments for things such

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:41.069 
may provide treatments for things such
as<00:00:39.309> stroke<00:00:39.670> spinal<00:00:40.120> cord<00:00:40.510> injury<00:00:40.839> brain

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
we use those patients stem cells to

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.520 
we use those patients stem cells to
develop<00:01:06.640> tissue<00:01:07.000> to<00:01:07.270> replace<00:01:07.600> those<00:01:07.930> tissues

if you will that may render this patient

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.050 
if you will that may render this patient
amenable<00:01:53.080> to<00:01:53.140> a<00:01:53.289> certain<00:01:53.619> treatment<00:01:54.000> this<00:01:55.000> is

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
amenable to a certain treatment this is

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.350 
amenable to a certain treatment this is
the<00:01:55.270> patient<00:01:56.020> that<00:01:56.050> we<00:01:56.200> saw<00:01:56.759> growing<00:01:57.759> from<00:01:58.179> the

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
the patient that we saw growing from the

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.149 
the patient that we saw growing from the
operating<00:01:58.780> room<00:01:58.990> two<00:01:59.259> days<00:01:59.409> it's<00:01:59.649> clear<00:01:59.890> spot

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
operating room two days it's clear spot

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.430 
operating room two days it's clear spot
for<00:02:00.369> that<00:02:00.490> blood<00:02:00.700> over<00:02:00.940> there<00:02:01.119> when<00:02:01.810> I<00:02:01.840> came
