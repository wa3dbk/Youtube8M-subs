00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.840 
this that's the plan functionality it's
not<00:01:54.299> in<00:01:54.390> place<00:01:54.569> yet<00:01:54.600> this<00:01:54.959> is<00:01:55.110> still<00:01:55.170> approach

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
not in place yet this is still approach

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.190 
not in place yet this is still approach
product<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:57.000> would<00:01:57.119> interact<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.780> physical

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
product it would interact the physical

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.930 
product it would interact the physical
buttons<00:01:58.590> would<00:01:58.830> interact<00:01:59.069> with<00:01:59.429> the<00:01:59.640> software

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
buttons would interact with the software

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.960 
buttons would interact with the software
in<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.179> app<00:02:00.299> that's<00:02:00.720> right<00:02:00.959> ok<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.759> child<00:02:02.759> is

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
in the app that's right ok a child is

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:09.169 
in the app that's right ok a child is
playing<00:02:03.299> over<00:02:03.720> Leslie<00:02:03.869> on<00:02:04.200> this<00:02:04.380> side<00:02:08.060> all<00:02:09.060> the

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
playing over Leslie on this side all the

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.360 
playing over Leslie on this side all the
different<00:02:09.509> games<00:02:09.660> are<00:02:10.319> corresponding<00:02:11.130> to<00:02:11.280> the

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
different games are corresponding to the

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.370 
different games are corresponding to the
various<00:02:11.700> functionality<00:02:12.480> on<00:02:12.630> the<00:02:12.660> electronic

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
various functionality on the electronic

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.100 
various functionality on the electronic
table<00:02:13.830> so<00:02:14.220> this<00:02:14.340> is<00:02:14.489> a<00:02:14.519> driving<00:02:14.880> based<00:02:15.510> game<00:02:15.840> a

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
table so this is a driving based game a

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.620 
table so this is a driving based game a
child<00:02:16.590> would<00:02:16.769> play<00:02:16.950> a<00:02:16.980> driving<00:02:17.430> based<00:02:17.640> game<00:02:17.940> if

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
child would play a driving based game if

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.870 
child would play a driving based game if
they<00:02:18.900> played<00:02:19.349> on<00:02:19.380> this<00:02:19.680> side<00:02:19.950> they<00:02:20.580> would<00:02:20.700> now

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
they played on this side they would now

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.449 
they played on this side they would now
play<00:02:21.209> a<00:02:21.540> shape<00:02:22.019> based<00:02:22.290> game<00:02:22.530> so<00:02:22.950> be<00:02:23.130> crushed

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
play a shape based game so be crushed

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.789 
play a shape based game so be crushed
let's<00:02:23.700> say<00:02:23.850> for<00:02:24.060> example<00:02:24.510> this<00:02:24.660> purple<00:02:25.079> square

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
let's say for example this purple square

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:28.099 
let's say for example this purple square
yep<00:02:26.070> it'll<00:02:26.700> release<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.450> hot<00:02:27.600> air<00:02:27.780> balloon

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:28.109 
yep it'll release the hot air balloon

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:29.449 
yep it'll release the hot air balloon
into<00:02:28.470> the<00:02:28.650> sky<00:02:28.859> gotcha

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
into the sky gotcha

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:31.370 
into the sky gotcha
and<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:30.090> the<00:02:30.420> thinking<00:02:30.780> is<00:02:30.900> is<00:02:31.170> that

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
and and the thinking is is that

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.690 
and and the thinking is is that
depending<00:02:31.799> on<00:02:31.920> what<00:02:32.070> side<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.370> child<00:02:32.579> is

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
depending on what side the child is

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.340 
depending on what side the child is
playing<00:02:32.910> on<00:02:33.150> that<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.570> screen<00:02:33.840> would<00:02:33.989> orient

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
playing on that the screen would orient

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.319 
playing on that the screen would orient
itself<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.160> correct<00:02:35.519> way<00:02:35.670> that's<00:02:35.940> correct

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.329 
itself the correct way that's correct

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:40.180 
itself the correct way that's correct
all<00:02:36.420> right<00:02:36.600> great<00:02:36.989> great<00:02:37.350> wonderful<00:02:37.799> great

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
all right great great wonderful great

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.890 
all right great great wonderful great
