just what I basically have to do is stop
there<00:04:02.310> to<00:04:02.400> stop<00:04:02.700> this<00:04:03.269> program<00:04:03.840> that<00:04:04.049> turns<00:04:04.260> it

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
there to stop this program that turns it

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.220 
there to stop this program that turns it
into<00:04:04.650> like<00:04:04.830> this<00:04:05.010> swf<00:04:05.700> thing<00:04:05.970> and<00:04:06.330> then<00:04:06.959> I

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
into like this swf thing and then I

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.740 
into like this swf thing and then I
could<00:04:07.799> easily<00:04:08.310> just<00:04:08.549> go<00:04:09.000> off<00:04:09.120> from<00:04:09.330> there<00:04:09.600> and

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
could easily just go off from there and

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.070 
could easily just go off from there and
then<00:04:10.410> it's<00:04:11.040> just<00:04:11.250> as<00:04:11.400> one<00:04:11.580> file<00:04:11.850> to<00:04:12.150> it<00:04:12.510> sound

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
then it's just as one file to it sound

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.740 
then it's just as one file to it sound
that<00:04:13.200> everything<00:04:13.980> goes<00:04:14.160> into<00:04:14.310> one<00:04:14.519> file<00:04:14.790> so<00:04:15.720> I

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
that everything goes into one file so I

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.690 
that everything goes into one file so I
don't<00:04:16.019> have<00:04:16.140> a<00:04:16.380> separate<00:04:16.769> audio<00:04:16.919> file<00:04:17.370> it

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
don't have a separate audio file it

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.460 
don't have a separate audio file it
always<00:04:17.970> just<00:04:18.150> stays<00:04:18.450> in<00:04:18.630> the<00:04:18.720> one<00:04:18.900> so<00:04:19.140> it's<00:04:19.289> not

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
always just stays in the one so it's not

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.099 
always just stays in the one so it's not
as<00:04:19.709> much<00:04:20.070> editing<00:04:20.340> as<00:04:20.669> other

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
as much editing as other

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:23.770 
as much editing as other
I<00:04:21.169> think<00:04:22.069> it<00:04:22.189> is<00:04:22.219> so<00:04:22.969> odd<00:04:23.150> editing<00:04:23.449> having<00:04:23.689> the

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
I think it is so odd editing having the

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:25.629 
I think it is so odd editing having the
two<00:04:23.930> pictures<00:04:24.139> in<00:04:24.409> the<00:04:24.500> music<00:04:24.949> and<00:04:25.099> then<00:04:25.280> like

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 
two pictures in the music and then like

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:29.320 
two pictures in the music and then like
the<00:04:25.789> words<00:04:26.590> um<00:04:27.610> but<00:04:28.610> I've<00:04:28.729> sort<00:04:29.120> of<00:04:29.150> gotten

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
the words um but I've sort of gotten

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:30.399 
the words um but I've sort of gotten
used<00:04:29.419> to<00:04:29.659> it<00:04:29.689> cause<00:04:29.870> I've<00:04:29.990> been<00:04:30.080> doing<00:04:30.319> it
