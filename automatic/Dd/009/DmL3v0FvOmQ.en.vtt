so let me get the metronome going so I

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.620 
so let me get the metronome going so I
got<00:02:43.530> my<00:02:43.680> click<00:02:44.400> going<00:02:44.820> here<00:02:45.090> should<00:02:45.480> always

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
got my click going here should always

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.290 
got my click going here should always
have<00:02:45.960> our<00:02:46.260> metronome<00:02:47.160> our<00:02:47.520> drum<00:02:47.820> beat<00:02:48.030> or

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
four so if we add in the g-string here a

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.800 
four so if we add in the g-string here a
little<00:03:52.080> bit<00:03:52.260> and<00:03:52.470> do<00:03:52.740> like<00:03:53.130> a<00:03:53.240> triplet<00:03:54.240> feel

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.710 
and go well let me show you the a these
are<00:04:04.140> the<00:04:04.230> notes<00:04:04.440> I'm<00:04:04.680> going<00:04:04.830> to<00:04:04.890> be<00:04:05.010> old<00:04:05.540> so<00:04:06.540> the

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
are the notes I'm going to be old so the

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.800 
are the notes I'm going to be old so the
G<00:04:07.050> would<00:04:07.350> be<00:04:07.380> using<00:04:08.040> these<00:04:08.459> two<00:04:08.790> open<00:04:09.330> strings

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:52.580 

so<00:04:25.040> two<00:04:26.300> up<00:04:27.300> to<00:04:27.780> three<00:04:50.810> is<00:04:51.810> the<00:04:51.960> only<00:04:52.140> really

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
so two up to three is the only really

00:04:52.590 --> 00:05:15.830 
so two up to three is the only really
weird<00:04:52.830> one<00:04:53.130> that's<00:05:11.900> alright<00:05:14.450> it's<00:05:15.450> a<00:05:15.600> pretty

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
weird one that's alright it's a pretty

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:38.749 
weird one that's alright it's a pretty
slow

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:38.759 

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:41.239 

and<00:05:39.089> then<00:05:39.300> coming<00:05:40.229> back<00:05:40.259> down<00:05:40.469> start<00:05:41.039> from<00:05:41.159> the

00:05:41.239 --> 00:05:41.249 
and then coming back down start from the

00:05:41.249 --> 00:06:00.510 
and then coming back down start from the
top

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.420 

so<00:06:01.520> like<00:06:01.940> I<00:06:02.150> say<00:06:02.360> start<00:06:02.750> off<00:06:02.960> slow<00:06:03.290> build<00:06:04.160> up

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 
so like I say start off slow build up

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:05.170 
so like I say start off slow build up
your<00:06:04.610> speed

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:05.180 
your speed

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.010 
your speed
make<00:06:05.600> sure<00:06:05.900> your<00:06:06.260> clarity<00:06:07.190> and<00:06:07.670> you<00:06:08.300> know<00:06:08.420> nice

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:12.590 
clear notes solid and build up your

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.340 
clear notes solid and build up your
speed<00:06:12.770> and<00:06:13.310> once<00:06:14.180> you<00:06:14.330> get<00:06:14.480> going<00:06:14.720> you'll<00:06:15.170> be

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:15.350 
speed and once you get going you'll be

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.490 
speed and once you get going you'll be
absolutely<00:06:15.560> flying
