00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.150
 with the consequences 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.340
 the perfect 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:14.860
 work 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.550
 concrete parts at the wells and system 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.280
 come 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.860
 we want to introduce that with it 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:23.680
 little effort is possible, for example 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:26.050
 a flue gas pipe or if desired 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.470
 to place a lok kicker 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:32.879
 they only need the following 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:37.270
 additional tools or materials 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:40.140
 a self-adhesive sub band a 14 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:44.710
 or 16 stone drills one to two 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:47.440
 diamond saw blades piece price about 360 and 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.160
 plus a jigsaw tile 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.890
 arrows 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.010
 the price is 8 euros and in each 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.890
 Baumarkt available and a piece flows 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.700
 to grind 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.460
 at the same time we want here 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.530
 demonstrate that adjustments not only 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.590
 with the simplest tools but also 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.119
 easy and fast and if it is 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.460
 worked in the customer's living room 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:11.530
 can be 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:15.580
 our working example shows the installation 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:18.429
 The first thing we do is place an air grille 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:22.060
 the exact cut and dear 

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:24.369
 Two times measure it carefully 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.610
 Working always happens in the end 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:29.800
 instead of a flex we will pay 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.259
 for the cut using a jigsaw 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.840
 and to protect the surface 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:37.569
 we'll get the outer one with an update 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:41.190
 tied off and this precautionary measure 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:44.590
 prevents possible scratches 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:47.520
 It is recommended that the corners with a 12 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:51.009
 14 to hear before there 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.660
 the material of the finished parts of the finder 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:56.979
 can be relatively good and easy 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:59.830
 Treat the vacuum cleaner always makes 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:02.020
 good services and every client 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.610
 Happy if possible with as possible 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.610
 little dust integration 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.620
 important in the jigsaw we have one 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:23.040
 with diamond-studded saw blade for 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:25.379
 cutting ceramic intervene 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.450
 second always sharp saw blade 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:29.910
 not a pity 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:34.040
 Cuttings will then be exact there 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.040
 fast and hardly gets dusty 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:39.490
 and our demand for the british 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.140
 Creating a jigsaw is easy 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:44.450
 recesses for an air saver or a 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.370
 smoker gas place try another 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.600
 Purpose easy and gentle loved 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.600
 to cut out a jigsaw 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:04.270
 the hole is now seen that sawn 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:06.970
 he will give a piece and thus the 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:11.880
 kit fits in we recommend the edges 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.880
 with a coarse or vasco central 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:22.989
 even the adhesive tapes will not work now 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:31.330
 needed more and then we are already 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:34.030
 at the finish because the outer shell as 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.739
 emphasizes heat concrete at the same time 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.519
 we should work again 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:42.160
 short with a room closing over it and 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:51.340
 give the concrete shell in quasi 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:53.019
 Final cut when the cut 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:58.660
 that's what he's supposed to be 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:04:04.890
 Of course , we are still checking over 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:08.910
 everything works fine no jammed 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.910
 that was it really 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.560
 we wish a lot of success in the future 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.280
 work with the system chimneys and 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.280
