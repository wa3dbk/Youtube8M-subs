of reasons
first<00:00:34.290> of<00:00:34.469> all<00:00:34.559> lime<00:00:34.890> skill<00:00:35.219> at<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.520> bottom<00:00:35.790> of

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
first of all lime skill at the bottom of

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:46.279 
first of all lime skill at the bottom of
your<00:00:35.940> kettle<00:00:36.440> grows<00:00:44.809> second<00:00:45.809> of<00:00:45.899> all<00:00:46.020> it

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
your kettle grows second of all it

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.979 
your kettle grows second of all it
actually<00:00:46.500> uses<00:00:46.980> more<00:00:47.430> energy<00:00:47.480> to<00:00:48.480> boil<00:00:48.719> water

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
actually uses more energy to boil water

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.500 
actually uses more energy to boil water
when<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:49.500> have<00:00:49.800> lime<00:00:50.129> scale<00:00:50.460> on<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:51.030> element

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
when you have lime scale on the element

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.600 
when you have lime scale on the element
the<00:00:52.050> element<00:00:52.079> has<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.739> work<00:00:52.890> harder<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.370> blow

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
the element has to work harder to blow

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.910 
the element has to work harder to blow
your<00:00:53.910> water<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.539> then<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.469> can<00:00:55.620> end<00:00:55.770> up

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
your water and then you can end up

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.889 
your water and then you can end up
burning<00:00:56.160> out<00:00:56.370> your<00:00:56.399> element<00:00:56.969> so<00:00:57.210> don't<00:00:57.780> wanna

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
burning out your element so don't wanna

army break down the lime scale and the
steam<00:02:20.690> caused<00:02:21.260> from<00:02:21.530> boiling<00:02:22.070> will<00:02:22.310> also<00:02:22.700> help

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
steam caused from boiling will also help

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.819 
steam caused from boiling will also help
clean<00:02:23.180> off<00:02:23.480> the<00:02:23.720> rest<00:02:23.930> of<00:02:24.079> the<00:02:24.140> counter<00:02:24.500> and<00:02:24.709> I
