00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
how do you know the other side because I

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.080 
how do you know the other side because I
can<00:01:24.630> recognize<00:01:25.200> anything<00:01:25.770> your<00:01:26.159> robot<00:01:26.759> type

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090

yellow bits on their arms oh I think I

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.810 
yellow bits on their arms oh I think I
recognize<00:01:31.409> it<00:01:31.590> from<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:31.979> there<00:01:32.460> is<00:01:32.580> another

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
recognize it from that there is another

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.300 
recognize it from that there is another
way<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.030> looking<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.840> but<00:01:34.680> I've<00:01:34.920> got<00:01:34.950> worked
