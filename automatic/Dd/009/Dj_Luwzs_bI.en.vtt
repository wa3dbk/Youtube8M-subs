enough<00:02:13.640> for<00:02:13.880> god<00:02:14.060> that's<00:02:14.960> probably<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:15.650> case

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
enough for god that's probably the case

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.350 
enough for god that's probably the case
like<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.220> thing<00:02:16.460> that<00:02:16.610> I<00:02:16.640> worry<00:02:17.030> about<00:02:17.120> is
