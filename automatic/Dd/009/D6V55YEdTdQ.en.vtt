00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
companion video because I've kind of

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.210 
companion video because I've kind of
changed<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.080> arrangement<00:00:25.619> of<00:00:25.710> this<00:00:25.830> tuna<00:00:26.130> a

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
changed the arrangement of this tuna a

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
changed the arrangement of this tuna a
little<00:00:26.430> bit<00:00:26.750> I'd<00:00:27.750> left<00:00:27.930> out<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.140> chord<00:00:29.210> when<00:00:30.210> I

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
little bit I'd left out a chord when I

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.560 
little bit I'd left out a chord when I
figured<00:00:30.630> out<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.840> song<00:00:31.130> and<00:00:32.420> said<00:00:33.420> now<00:00:33.540> I

figured out the song and said now I
figured<00:00:33.930> out<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.200> quarter<00:00:34.440> video<00:00:35.399> that<00:00:36.180> song

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
figured out the quarter video that song

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.360 
figured out the quarter video that song
starts<00:00:37.020> out<00:00:37.110> with<00:00:37.260> e<00:00:37.440> I<00:00:37.829> just<00:00:38.070> played<00:00:38.250> in<00:00:38.309> the

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
starts out with e I just played in the

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.810 
starts out with e I just played in the
first<00:00:38.550> position<00:00:38.940> here

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.029 

I<00:00:42.880> bet<00:00:43.390> the<00:00:44.170> c-sharp<00:00:44.800> minor'

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
I bet the c-sharp minor'

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.090 
I bet the c-sharp minor'
dan<00:00:47.539> uses<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:48.570> different<00:00:49.019> voicing<00:00:49.499> here<00:00:49.739> that<00:00:50.070> I

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
dan uses a different voicing here that I

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.299 
dan uses a different voicing here that I
haven't<00:00:50.399> been<00:00:50.609> able<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.850> figure<00:00:51.059> out<00:00:51.269> just<00:00:51.539> yet

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
haven't been able to figure out just yet

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.009 
haven't been able to figure out just yet
but<00:00:53.309> if<00:00:53.519> you<00:00:53.609> play<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:53.909> in<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.149> normal<00:00:54.479> fourth

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:55.019 
but if you play it in the normal fourth

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:57.569 
but if you play it in the normal fourth
position<00:00:55.440> here

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
position here

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:00.270 
position here
the<00:00:58.030> work<00:00:58.239> and<00:00:59.020> then<00:00:59.440> you<00:00:59.559> go<00:00:59.680> to<00:00:59.739> an<00:01:00.010> f-sharp

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
the work and then you go to an f-sharp

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.189 
the work and then you go to an f-sharp
minor

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.250 

standard<00:01:05.980> bar<00:01:06.160> chord<00:01:06.430> form<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.840> then<00:01:07.960> I<00:01:08.050> play

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
standard bar chord form and then I play

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.620 
standard bar chord form and then I play
a<00:01:08.670> B<00:01:09.670> major<00:01:09.940> here

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.149 

and<00:01:13.440> just<00:01:13.590> like<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:13.860> power<00:01:14.070> cord<00:01:16.100> you<00:01:17.100> can

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
and just like that power cord you can

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.340 
and just like that power cord you can
play<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.460> bottom<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:17.909> like<00:01:18.060> that<00:01:18.240> on<00:01:18.510> the

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.249 

very<00:01:54.840> easy

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.499 

right<00:02:00.259> so<00:02:01.009> look<00:02:01.369> the<00:02:01.460> next<00:02:01.700> part<00:02:02.060> of<00:02:02.149> that<00:02:02.329> on

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
right so look the next part of that on

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.230 
right so look the next part of that on
there

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:22.600 

sir

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.180 

so<00:02:23.570> there's<00:02:23.750> a<00:02:23.810> lot<00:02:23.960> going<00:02:24.260> on<00:02:24.350> there<00:02:24.650> that's

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
so there's a lot going on there that's

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:26.500 
so there's a lot going on there that's
kind<00:02:25.490> of<00:02:25.520> the<00:02:25.610> trickiest<00:02:26.120> part<00:02:26.330> of<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:26.450> whole

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
kind of the trickiest part of the whole

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.470 
kind of the trickiest part of the whole
song<00:02:26.810> but<00:02:27.140> exciting<00:02:27.590> that<00:02:27.710> hard<00:02:28.210> once<00:02:29.210> you<00:02:29.360> get

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
song but exciting that hard once you get

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:45.140 
song but exciting that hard once you get
it<00:02:29.630> together<00:02:29.780> so<00:02:30.670> moving<00:02:31.670> on

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.330 

it's<00:02:45.599> a<00:02:47.690> kind<00:02:48.690> of<00:02:48.720> a<00:02:48.810> big<00:02:49.019> reach<00:02:49.769> and<00:02:50.159> I<00:02:50.280> don't

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
it's a kind of a big reach and I don't

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.740 
it's a kind of a big reach and I don't
know<00:02:50.519> if<00:02:50.610> Dan<00:02:50.760> plays<00:02:51.030> it<00:02:51.180> differently<00:02:51.510> but

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
know if Dan plays it differently but

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.690 
know if Dan plays it differently but
that's<00:02:52.170> hard<00:02:52.440> but<00:02:55.159> such<00:02:56.159> a<00:02:56.190> think<00:02:56.489> of<00:02:56.580> this

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
that's hard but such a think of this

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:05.000 
that's hard but such a think of this
thing<00:02:56.940> a<00:02:57.000> little<00:02:57.120> tiny<00:02:57.390> peices<00:02:57.720> actually<00:03:04.010> back

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
thing a little tiny peices actually back

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:11.490 
thing a little tiny peices actually back
into<00:03:05.220> the<00:03:05.310> c-sharp<00:03:05.670> minor'<00:03:08.360> just<00:03:09.360> a
