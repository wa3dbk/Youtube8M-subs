his<00:03:48.280> only<00:03:48.610> downfall<00:03:48.970> is<00:03:49.209> that<00:03:49.300> he's<00:03:49.480> five<00:03:49.750> foot

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989

his only downfall is that he's five foot
eight<00:03:50.020> and<00:03:50.140> I<00:03:50.290> actually<00:03:50.500> think<00:03:50.860> that<00:03:51.010> he<00:03:51.220> makes

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.070 
eight and I actually think that he makes
up<00:03:51.610> for<00:03:51.640> it<00:03:51.940> because<00:03:52.090> he's<00:03:52.390> not<00:03:52.570> weak<00:03:52.810> on<00:03:52.989> the

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
up for it because he's not weak on the

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.410 
up for it because he's not weak on the
ball<00:03:53.290> and<00:03:53.560> with<00:03:54.040> the<00:03:54.160> way<00:03:54.280> that<00:03:54.430> he<00:03:54.550> climbs<00:03:54.970> and

ball and with the way that he climbs and

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.570 
ball and with the way that he climbs and
kind<00:03:55.690> of<00:03:55.840> moves<00:03:56.050> around<00:03:56.470> he<00:03:56.830> just<00:03:56.860> feels<00:03:57.310> so

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
kind of moves around he just feels so

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.040 
kind of moves around he just feels so
much<00:03:57.760> stronger<00:03:58.090> and<00:03:58.360> a<00:03:58.420> lot<00:03:58.570> bigger<00:03:58.810> on<00:03:59.020> the
