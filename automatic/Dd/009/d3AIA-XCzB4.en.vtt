00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
think if you ever played the game

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.900 
think if you ever played the game
telephone<00:03:10.290> how<00:03:10.650> one<00:03:10.890> message<00:03:11.310> starts<00:03:11.520> on<00:03:11.760> one

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
telephone how one message starts on one

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.280 
telephone how one message starts on one
end<00:03:12.120> of<00:03:12.210> the<00:03:12.270> room<00:03:12.450> by<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:12.780> time<00:03:12.870> it<00:03:13.170> goes

around it's completely different

I think the hairy man the vergis trails

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.080 
I think the hairy man the vergis trails
probably<00:03:18.030> is<00:03:18.120> like<00:03:18.810> a<00:03:18.840> big<00:03:19.380> telephone<00:03:20.090> game

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090
