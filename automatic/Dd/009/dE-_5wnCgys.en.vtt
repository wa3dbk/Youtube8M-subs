00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.760
 cook popcorn is simple but here 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.769
 common variations with salt or sugar 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.869
 somehow really trite i have 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.090
 one idea how to cook the original 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:16.680
 no tasty peanut popcorn 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:20.100
 sauce and praline 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.750
 drove to cook in the pan 0 literally 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.160
 one and a half tablespoons 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.140
 vegetable oil 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.140
 ideally use neutral oil 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.510
 tasteless such as coconut for example 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.469
 if not use refined 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.780
 sunflower cornmeal 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.690
 I close the lid in a couple of minutes they will start 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.390
 burst and did you know that not all 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.370
 corn is suitable for popcorn here 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.710
 for example from the usual order nothing 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.989
 all the same not all varieties of corn 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.120
 know how to explode so look in 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.249
 grain store just for popcorn 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.219
 when the grains have stopped bursting 

00:00:53.249 --> 00:00:58.889
 I tidy up the lid. 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.370
 even whole grains they will sink to hot 

00:00:58.889 --> 00:01:06.439
 bottom of the pot and also got upset rented 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.520
 I put fire into a bowl 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:10.979
 now quickly make the sauce 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.049
 I put on the stove a small pot into it 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.049
 I send 85 grams 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:20.340
 peanut butter 40 grams creamy 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.329
 butter 25 grams of sugar and a pinch 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.310
 vanilla extract 

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:25.950
 you want to add them on request 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.030
 want not constantly stirring to 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.770
 nothing burned 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:34.530
 bring to a boil well, these are the ingredients 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:38.479
 connected taking off from the fire and immediately 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.479
 pouring popcorn sauce 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.510
 gently shuffle to cover all 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.100
 granules sauce 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.470
 in principle, it could be my 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.950
 but will become even more interesting if 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:58.500
 add praline here again 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.810
 I mix if suddenly you do not know about 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.740
 liny this several species of finely 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.630
 ground nuts and sugar roasted 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.990
 Well, now everything is ready you can eat this 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.940
 popcorn both hot and cold 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:14.280
 it's amazingly tasty really a bit 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.280
 fatty but not every day this is 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.260
 and so sometimes it is possible and by the way in any 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.800
 the comparison does not go with what is sold in 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.500
 stores 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.080
 be sure to try if you want
