00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
economical to use I calculated that to

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.700 
economical to use I calculated that to
apply<00:02:25.750> three<00:02:26.200> coats<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:27.280> one<00:02:28.000> of<00:02:28.120> my<00:02:28.240> trees

apply three coats to one of my trees

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.360 
apply three coats to one of my trees
cost<00:02:29.710> 75<00:02:30.280> cents<00:02:31.440> and<00:02:32.440> I<00:02:32.650> can<00:02:32.860> do<00:02:33.040> it<00:02:33.160> a<00:02:33.220> lot

cost 75 cents and I can do it a lot

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.550 
cost 75 cents and I can do it a lot
faster<00:02:33.910> as<00:02:34.060> I<00:02:34.210> go<00:02:34.390> with<00:02:34.570> a<00:02:34.600> sprayer<00:02:35.020> and<00:02:35.380> you

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
faster as I go with a sprayer and you

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.010 
faster as I go with a sprayer and you
can<00:02:35.770> design<00:02:36.460> any<00:02:36.700> kind<00:02:36.790> of<00:02:37.120> sprayer<00:02:37.450> and<00:02:37.810> use

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
time to do the hundred and eighty three

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.600 
time to do the hundred and eighty three
is<00:02:43.630> three<00:02:43.960> times<00:02:44.470> because<00:02:45.070> I<00:02:45.160> did<00:02:45.340> it<00:02:45.370> myself

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
is three times because I did it myself

is three times because I did it myself
or<00:02:46.600> six<00:02:46.900> hours<00:02:47.380> so<00:02:47.920> as<00:02:48.070> you<00:02:48.220> could<00:02:48.400> see<00:02:48.430> it's<00:02:48.700> a

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
or six hours so as you could see it's a

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.670 
or six hours so as you could see it's a
very<00:02:48.760> clean<00:02:49.210> and<00:02:49.390> economical<00:02:49.900> process<00:02:50.170> the

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
entire process gets very nasty very

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.950 
entire process gets very nasty very
messy<00:02:53.770> the<00:02:54.430> tools<00:02:54.700> get<00:02:54.910> dirty<00:02:55.180> you<00:02:55.480> get<00:02:55.690> it<00:02:55.840> all

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
the three bandish on top and then after

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.500 
the three bandish on top and then after
the<00:03:28.690> tree<00:03:28.900> bandage<00:03:29.320> dries<00:03:29.850> I'm<00:03:30.850> applying<00:03:31.210> a

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
the tree bandage dries I'm applying a

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:38.130 
the tree bandage dries I'm applying a
coat<00:03:31.780> of<00:03:32.430> Y<00:03:33.450> latex<00:03:35.370> paint<00:03:36.370> actually<00:03:37.120> I'm<00:03:37.870> using

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
coat of Y latex paint actually I'm using

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.130 
coat of Y latex paint actually I'm using
kills<00:03:38.680> which<00:03:39.670> has<00:03:39.880> a<00:03:39.910> lot<00:03:40.240> of<00:03:40.270> fungal

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
kills which has a lot of fungal

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:47.280 
kills which has a lot of fungal
inhibitor<00:03:42.130> materials<00:03:43.350> so<00:03:44.350> actually<00:03:46.290> this

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
inhibitor materials so actually this

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.590 
inhibitor materials so actually this
seems<00:03:47.860> to<00:03:48.010> be<00:03:48.040> working<00:03:48.340> it's<00:03:48.730> pretty<00:03:48.940> hot<00:03:49.240> here

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
approximately another 500 trees to go

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.120 
approximately another 500 trees to go
which<00:04:09.280> I<00:04:09.460> will<00:04:09.610> be<00:04:09.730> doing<00:04:10.030> every<00:04:10.540> year<00:04:11.170> maybe

and in some cases it's even growing past
and<00:04:29.490> building<00:04:30.490> a<00:04:30.610> lot<00:04:30.790> of<00:04:30.940> tissue<00:04:31.150> sealing<00:04:31.990> the

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
and building a lot of tissue sealing the

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:38.210 
and building a lot of tissue sealing the
tree<00:04:32.530> and<00:04:34.740> living<00:04:35.740> it<00:04:35.890> in<00:04:36.070> very<00:04:36.490> good<00:04:36.670> shape

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
tree and living it in very good shape

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.900 
tree and living it in very good shape
this<00:04:39.220> was<00:04:39.490> done<00:04:41.040> about<00:04:42.040> a<00:04:42.100> nine<00:04:42.400> months<00:04:42.700> ago

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
this was done about a nine months ago

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:48.360 
this was done about a nine months ago
and<00:04:43.360> is<00:04:44.170> looking<00:04:44.470> really<00:04:45.040> well<00:04:46.920> this<00:04:47.920> is<00:04:48.160> the

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
and is looking really well this is the

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.910 
and is looking really well this is the
conventional<00:04:49.360> tarp<00:04:50.110> product<00:04:50.590> that<00:04:50.740> you<00:04:50.860> use

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:50.920 
conventional tarp product that you use

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.180 
conventional tarp product that you use
as<00:04:51.400> you<00:04:51.610> could<00:04:51.790> see<00:04:52.000> it<00:04:52.930> deteriorates<00:04:53.800> and

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
as you could see it deteriorates and

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.950 
as you could see it deteriorates and
water<00:04:54.520> gets<00:04:54.790> in<00:04:54.940> between<00:04:55.090> the<00:04:55.390> bark<00:04:55.630> and<00:04:55.810> the

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
water gets in between the bark and the

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.980 
water gets in between the bark and the
trunk<00:04:56.230> and<00:04:57.220> makes<00:04:57.730> it<00:04:57.910> very<00:04:58.090> susceptible<00:04:58.660> to

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
trunk and makes it very susceptible to

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.650 
trunk and makes it very susceptible to
all<00:04:59.380> kinds<00:04:59.860> of<00:04:59.920> insects<00:05:00.490> growing<00:05:01.000> in<00:05:01.240> there<00:05:01.540> as

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
all kinds of insects growing in there as

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.920 
all kinds of insects growing in there as
you<00:05:01.690> could<00:05:02.010> maybe<00:05:03.010> even<00:05:03.190> see<00:05:03.670> see<00:05:04.060> the<00:05:04.630> water

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
you could maybe even see see the water

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.130 
you could maybe even see see the water
the<00:05:05.110> humidity<00:05:05.590> is<00:05:06.370> not<00:05:06.790> very<00:05:07.420> good<00:05:07.720> product

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:08.140 
the humidity is not very good product

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.850 
the humidity is not very good product
after<00:05:08.500> a<00:05:08.800> while<00:05:09.220> it<00:05:10.120> looks<00:05:11.020> good<00:05:11.230> here<00:05:11.620> but

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
after a while it looks good here but

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.100 
after a while it looks good here but
water<00:05:12.160> seems<00:05:12.490> to<00:05:12.760> be<00:05:12.910> getting<00:05:13.270> in<00:05:13.420> here<00:05:13.750> and<00:05:13.990> as

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
water seems to be getting in here and as

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:19.130 
water seems to be getting in here and as
you<00:05:14.290> could<00:05:14.470> see<00:05:15.120> there<00:05:16.120> is<00:05:16.270> no<00:05:16.510> new<00:05:16.780> growth<00:05:17.770> of

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:19.140 
you could see there is no new growth of

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.500 
you could see there is no new growth of
tissue<00:05:20.140> to<00:05:20.860> seal<00:05:21.190> this<00:05:21.490> area<00:05:22.060> here<00:05:22.300> between

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510 
tissue to seal this area here between

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.590 
tissue to seal this area here between
the<00:05:22.780> bark<00:05:23.020> and<00:05:23.170> the<00:05:23.320> trunk
