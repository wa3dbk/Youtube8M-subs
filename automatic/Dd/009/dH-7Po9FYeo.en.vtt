Iran will not get a nuclear weapon I've
made<00:00:29.910> that<00:00:30.029> clear<00:00:30.300> when<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:30.689> came<00:00:30.840> into<00:00:31.170> office

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
made that clear when I came into office

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.000 
made that clear when I came into office
we<00:00:31.800> then<00:00:31.980> organized<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:33.180> strongest

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
we then organized the strongest

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.799 
we then organized the strongest
coalition<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:36.030> strongest<00:00:36.510> sanctions

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
coalition and the strongest sanctions

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.110 
coalition and the strongest sanctions
against<00:00:37.530> Iran<00:00:37.920> in<00:00:38.129> history<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:39.030> is

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
against Iran in history and it is

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.750 
against Iran in history and it is
crippling<00:00:39.600> their<00:00:39.809> economy<00:00:40.280> their<00:00:41.280> currency

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
crippling their economy their currency

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.479 
crippling their economy their currency
has<00:00:41.879> dropped<00:00:42.149> 80%<00:00:42.620> their<00:00:43.620> oil<00:00:43.829> production<00:00:43.980> has

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
has dropped 80% their oil production has

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.549 
has dropped 80% their oil production has
plunged<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.660> lowest<00:00:45.960> level<00:00:46.230> since<00:00:46.260> they

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
plunged to the lowest level since they

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.709 
plunged to the lowest level since they
were<00:00:46.620> fighting<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:47.039> war<00:00:47.250> with<00:00:47.280> Iraq<00:00:47.510> 20<00:00:48.510> years

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
were fighting a war with Iraq 20 years

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.139 
were fighting a war with Iraq 20 years
ago<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:49.829> their<00:00:49.980> economy<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.520> in<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.700> shambles

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
ago so their economy is in a shambles

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.630 
ago so their economy is in a shambles
and<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:52.170> reason<00:00:52.440> we<00:00:52.559> did<00:00:52.710> this<00:00:52.860> is<00:00:52.920> because<00:00:53.399> a

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
and the reason we did this is because a

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.840 
and the reason we did this is because a
nuclear<00:00:53.879> Iran<00:00:54.420> is<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.989> threat<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.559> our<00:00:56.010> national

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
nuclear Iran is a threat to our national

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.490 
nuclear Iran is a threat to our national
security<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.719> it's<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.989> threat<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:58.320> Israel's

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
security and it's a threat to Israel's

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.069 
security and it's a threat to Israel's
national<00:00:58.770> security<00:00:59.149> we<00:01:00.149> cannot<00:01:00.480> afford<00:01:00.750> to

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
national security we cannot afford to

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.189 
national security we cannot afford to

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
intelligence coordination that we do

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.130 
intelligence coordination that we do
with<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.880> range<00:01:57.210> of<00:01:57.390> countries<00:01:57.540> including

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
with a range of countries including

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.109 
with a range of countries including
Israel<00:01:58.469> we<00:01:59.159> have<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.340> sense<00:01:59.610> of<00:01:59.759> when<00:01:59.969> they

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
Israel we have a sense of when they

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.330 
Israel we have a sense of when they
would<00:02:00.270> get<00:02:00.390> breakout<00:02:00.780> capacity<00:02:01.310> which<00:02:02.310> means

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
would get breakout capacity which means

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.859 
would get breakout capacity which means
that<00:02:02.759> we<00:02:02.850> would<00:02:02.969> not<00:02:03.090> be<00:02:03.149> able<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.509> intervene

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
that we would not be able to intervene

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.289 
that we would not be able to intervene
in<00:02:04.140> time<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:05.159> stop<00:02:05.399> their<00:02:05.579> nuclear<00:02:05.610> program

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
in time to stop their nuclear program

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.240 
in time to stop their nuclear program
and<00:02:06.509> that<00:02:07.140> clock<00:02:07.350> is<00:02:07.500> ticking<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:07.979> we're

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
and that clock is ticking and we're

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.580 
and that clock is ticking and we're
going<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.429> make<00:02:08.550> sure<00:02:08.759> that<00:02:08.989> if<00:02:09.989> they<00:02:10.289> do<00:02:10.349> not

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
going to make sure that if they do not

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.160 
going to make sure that if they do not
meet<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.970> demands<00:02:12.300> of<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.540> international

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
meet the demands of the international

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.580 
meet the demands of the international
community

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
community

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.640 
community
then<00:02:14.390> we<00:02:15.390> are<00:02:15.540> going<00:02:15.629> to<00:02:15.690> take<00:02:15.930> all<00:02:16.140> options

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
then we are going to take all options

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.930 
then we are going to take all options
necessary<00:02:17.129> to<00:02:17.250> make<00:02:17.370> sure<00:02:17.489> they<00:02:17.640> don't<00:02:17.730> have<00:02:17.819> a

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
necessary to make sure they don't have a

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.780 
necessary to make sure they don't have a
nuclear<00:02:18.209> governor<00:02:18.540> I<00:02:18.750> think<00:02:19.670> from<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:20.760> very

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
nuclear governor I think from the very

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.280 
nuclear governor I think from the very
beginning<00:02:21.360> one<00:02:21.480> of<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:21.629> challenges<00:02:22.170> we've

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
beginning one of the challenges we've

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.110 
beginning one of the challenges we've
had<00:02:22.470> with<00:02:22.620> Iran<00:02:22.739> is<00:02:23.280> that<00:02:23.550> they<00:02:23.670> have<00:02:23.849> looked

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
had with Iran is that they have looked

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.880 
had with Iran is that they have looked
at<00:02:24.269> this<00:02:24.420> administration<00:02:25.080> and<00:02:25.230> felt<00:02:25.650> that<00:02:25.709> the

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
at this administration and felt that the

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.589 
at this administration and felt that the
administration<00:02:26.459> was<00:02:26.640> not<00:02:26.670> as<00:02:27.030> strong<00:02:27.150> as<00:02:27.360> it

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
administration was not as strong as it

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:28.009 
administration was not as strong as it
needed<00:02:27.780> to<00:02:27.810> be

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
needed to be

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.890 
needed to be
I<00:02:28.200> think<00:02:29.040> they<00:02:29.160> saw<00:02:29.370> weakness<00:02:29.819> where<00:02:30.660> they<00:02:30.780> had

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
I think they saw weakness where they had

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.400 
I think they saw weakness where they had
expected<00:02:31.200> to<00:02:31.410> find<00:02:31.470> American<00:02:32.099> strength
