painted you the ember glow which is an

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.980 
painted you the ember glow which is an
original<00:01:32.170> 66<00:01:32.740> color<00:01:33.009> I<00:01:33.420> think<00:01:34.420> we<00:01:34.659> got<00:01:34.810> the

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
original 66 color I think we got the

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.719 
original 66 color I think we got the
stance<00:01:35.590> about<00:01:35.860> where<00:01:36.189> we're<00:01:36.369> going<00:01:36.520> to<00:01:36.579> leave

it<00:01:37.200> kind<00:01:38.200> of<00:01:38.290> looks<00:01:38.530> like<00:01:38.590> one<00:01:38.950> of<00:01:38.979> the<00:01:39.100> old

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
it kind of looks like one of the old

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.569 
it kind of looks like one of the old
school<00:01:40.409> drag<00:01:41.409> cars<00:01:41.740> that<00:01:42.009> they<00:01:42.130> made<00:01:42.340> back<00:01:42.549> in

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:42.579 
school drag cars that they made back in

the day put some new torque thrust deep
wheels<00:01:45.970> on<00:01:46.270> and<00:01:47.200> they<00:01:47.320> really<00:01:47.590> look<00:01:47.680> good<00:01:47.740> on

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
wheels on and they really look good on

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.289 
wheels on and they really look good on
there<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.920> wheel<00:01:51.159> openings<00:01:51.610> came<00:01:51.820> out<00:01:51.970> really

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
there the wheel openings came out really

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:55.080 
there the wheel openings came out really
nice<00:01:52.540> you<00:01:52.810> can't<00:01:53.049> tell<00:01:53.259> they<00:01:53.380> were<00:01:53.530> altered<00:01:54.090> we

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
nice you can't tell they were altered we

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
got the clearance in the front of the

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:58.469 
got the clearance in the front of the
tires<00:01:56.500> now<00:01:56.649> I'd<00:01:57.430> get<00:01:57.670> my<00:01:57.790> fingers<00:01:58.149> all<00:01:58.299> the<00:01:58.329> way

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
tires now I'd get my fingers all the way

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.090 
tires now I'd get my fingers all the way
in<00:01:59.020> between<00:01:59.229> the<00:01:59.560> tire<00:01:59.770> and<00:01:59.799> the<00:02:01.649> rocker<00:02:02.649> panel

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
in between the tire and the rocker panel

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.830 
in between the tire and the rocker panel
now<00:02:03.250> and<00:02:03.899> looking<00:02:04.899> at<00:02:05.020> it<00:02:05.110> you<00:02:05.259> can't<00:02:05.500> tell<00:02:05.829> he

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
now and looking at it you can't tell he

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.620 
now and looking at it you can't tell he
shaped<00:02:07.840> them<00:02:07.990> in<00:02:08.140> real<00:02:08.350> nice<00:02:08.619> and<00:02:08.950> then

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
shaped them in real nice and then

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.270 
shaped them in real nice and then
there's<00:02:10.630> no<00:02:10.899> bead<00:02:11.200> at<00:02:11.410> all<00:02:11.560> or<00:02:11.860> nothing

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
there's no bead at all or nothing

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.280 
there's no bead at all or nothing
underneath<00:02:12.640> here<00:02:13.060> it's<00:02:13.750> not<00:02:13.900> like<00:02:13.959> we<00:02:14.260> just

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
underneath here it's not like we just

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.199 
underneath here it's not like we just
rolled<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.799> lip<00:02:15.010> under<00:02:15.370> it's<00:02:15.640> nice<00:02:15.940> and

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
rolled the lip under it's nice and

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:17.580 
rolled the lip under it's nice and
smooth<00:02:16.450> so<00:02:16.480> there's<00:02:16.930> nothing<00:02:17.200> under<00:02:17.380> there<00:02:17.500> to

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
smooth so there's nothing under there to

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.430 
smooth so there's nothing under there to
catch<00:02:17.799> any<00:02:17.980> dirt<00:02:18.220> for<00:02:19.060> anything<00:02:19.269> and<00:02:20.260> if<00:02:20.380> the

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
catch any dirt for anything and if the

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.220 
catch any dirt for anything and if the
tires<00:02:20.680> ever<00:02:20.950> do<00:02:21.130> hit<00:02:21.370> it<00:02:21.400> it's<00:02:22.000> it's<00:02:22.989> not<00:02:23.110> going

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
tires ever do hit it it's it's not going
