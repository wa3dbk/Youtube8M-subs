00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
disappointing thing was that the

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.069 
disappointing thing was that the
decision<00:02:28.190> was<00:02:28.580> made<00:02:28.640> without<00:02:29.030> the<00:02:29.780> players

decision was made without the players
agreement<00:02:30.860> which<00:02:31.069> does<00:02:31.459> seem<00:02:31.730> to<00:02:31.849> be<00:02:31.940> a<00:02:31.970> very

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
agreement which does seem to be a very

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.020 
agreement which does seem to be a very
risky<00:02:32.590> policy<00:02:33.590> as<00:02:33.829> far<00:02:34.099> as<00:02:34.250> the<00:02:34.370> organizers

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
risky policy as far as the organizers

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:36.729 
risky policy as far as the organizers
are<00:02:35.060> concerned<00:02:35.540> yeah<00:02:35.870> Raph<00:02:36.140> was<00:02:36.410> also

are concerned yeah Raph was also

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:38.860 
are concerned yeah Raph was also

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.330 
to pay the money to watch it but there
is<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:57.769> danger<00:02:58.010> that<00:02:58.609> if<00:02:58.760> you<00:02:59.109> just<00:03:00.340> consult

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
is the danger that if you just consult

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.580

amazing<00:03:13.910> season<00:03:14.239> finishing<00:03:14.660> area<00:03:14.810> to<00:03:15.350> me<00:03:15.500> is

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
amazing season finishing area to me is

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.319 
amazing season finishing area to me is
ridiculous<00:03:16.160> because<00:03:16.609> that's<00:03:17.060> what<00:03:17.239> the

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:17.329 
ridiculous because that's what the

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:19.300 
ridiculous because that's what the
players<00:03:17.569> wanted<00:03:17.959> so<00:03:18.170> there<00:03:18.620> is<00:03:18.739> a<00:03:18.769> balancing

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
players wanted so there is a balancing

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.930 
players wanted so there is a balancing
act<00:03:19.549> but<00:03:20.000> I'll<00:03:20.359> say<00:03:20.660> go<00:03:21.049> back<00:03:21.260> to<00:03:21.940> ultimately

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
act but I'll say go back to ultimately

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.670 
act but I'll say go back to ultimately
the<00:03:23.060> top<00:03:23.269> four<00:03:23.510> are<00:03:23.780> the<00:03:23.930> most<00:03:24.079> important<00:03:24.560> I

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
the top four are the most important I

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.890 
the top four are the most important I
think<00:03:24.769> not<00:03:24.920> to<00:03:25.250> just<00:03:25.430> ask<00:03:25.639> them<00:03:25.940> I<00:03:26.120> could<00:03:26.810> have

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:26.900 
think not to just ask them I could have

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.479 
think not to just ask them I could have
even<00:03:27.019> asked<00:03:27.440> them<00:03:27.500> and<00:03:27.680> then<00:03:27.799> gone<00:03:28.280> their<00:03:28.459> own

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:28.489 
even asked them and then gone their own

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.180 
even asked them and then gone their own
direction<00:03:29.030> but<00:03:29.150> do<00:03:29.239> not<00:03:29.389> even<00:03:29.569> ask<00:03:29.930> Novak<00:03:30.410> Rafa

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
direction but do not even ask Novak Rafa

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.360 
direction but do not even ask Novak Rafa
and<00:03:31.780> Federer<00:03:32.780> I<00:03:32.959> think<00:03:33.260> is<00:03:33.380> wrong<00:03:33.590> I<00:03:33.799> mean<00:03:33.950> they

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
and Federer I think is wrong I mean they

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.099 
and Federer I think is wrong I mean they
haven't<00:03:34.579> practiced<00:03:34.849> on<00:03:35.209> it<00:03:35.359> they've<00:03:35.750> had<00:03:35.959> the

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:36.109 
haven't practiced on it they've had the

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:37.960 
haven't practiced on it they've had the

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.819 
got to play tomorrow but can you just
have<00:03:43.790> 45<00:03:44.299> minutes<00:03:44.569> practice<00:03:45.380> on<00:03:45.530> your<00:03:45.620> blue

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
have 45 minutes practice on your blue

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:47.289 
have 45 minutes practice on your blue
court<00:03:46.130> before<00:03:46.280> you<00:03:46.519> caught<00:03:46.730> a<00:03:46.760> final<00:03:47.150> match

court before you caught a final match
that<00:03:48.019> can't<00:03:48.260> happen<00:03:48.470> so<00:03:49.010> I<00:03:49.280> do<00:03:49.579> I<00:03:50.060> do<00:03:50.180> see<00:03:50.720> the

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
that can't happen so I do I do see the

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.569 
that can't happen so I do I do see the
players<00:03:51.109> side<00:03:51.380> of<00:03:51.530> it<00:03:51.650> I<00:03:51.739> think<00:03:51.799> it<00:03:52.130> would've<00:03:52.400> I

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
players side of it I think it would've I

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:54.039 
players side of it I think it would've I
think<00:03:52.849> he<00:03:52.910> looks<00:03:53.090> great<00:03:53.389> but<00:03:53.959> I<00:03:54.019> think

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
think he looks great but I think

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:55.479 
think he looks great but I think
ultimately<00:03:54.290> it<00:03:54.680> might<00:03:54.859> have<00:03:54.980> been<00:03:55.069> better<00:03:55.310> to

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
ultimately it might have been better to

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.970 
ultimately it might have been better to
just<00:03:55.880> go<00:03:56.090> for<00:03:56.450> a<00:03:56.840> couple<00:03:57.410> of<00:03:57.500> lower<00:03:57.680> level

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
just go for a couple of lower level

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.680 
just go for a couple of lower level

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.370 
freshly laid surface and Simon Says I
think<00:05:10.940> the<00:05:11.000> blue<00:05:11.150> clay<00:05:11.330> is<00:05:11.450> much<00:05:11.690> easier<00:05:12.229> on

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
think the blue clay is much easier on

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:12.969 
think the blue clay is much easier on
the<00:05:12.560> eye

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:12.979 
the eye

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:14.590 
the eye
bring<00:05:13.370> something<00:05:13.790> different<00:05:13.970> to<00:05:14.300> the<00:05:14.360> clay

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:14.600 
bring something different to the clay

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.750 
bring something different to the clay
court<00:05:14.870> season<00:05:14.960> these<00:05:15.440> pros<00:05:15.860> should<00:05:16.400> be<00:05:16.550> used

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
court season these pros should be used

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.150 
court season these pros should be used
to<00:05:16.880> adapting<00:05:17.479> to<00:05:17.900> different<00:05:18.110> court<00:05:18.560> types<00:05:18.830> and

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
to adapting to different court types and

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.960 
to adapting to different court types and
surfaces<00:05:19.880> so<00:05:20.330> it<00:05:20.570> shouldn't<00:05:20.900> be<00:05:21.500> an<00:05:21.710> issue<00:05:22.010> at

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
surfaces so it shouldn't be an issue at

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.390 
surfaces so it shouldn't be an issue at
