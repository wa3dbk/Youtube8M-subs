are so far we're making progress okay in
this<00:00:40.739> first<00:00:41.070> box<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.670> looks<00:00:41.700> like<00:00:42.090> we<00:00:42.360> have<00:00:42.570> the

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
this first box it looks like we have the

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.690 
this first box it looks like we have the
controller<00:00:43.469> what<00:00:43.920> does<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.129> call<00:00:44.399> that's

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
controller what does that call that's

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.150 
controller what does that call that's
your<00:00:44.879> FFT<00:00:45.390> control<00:00:45.750> info<00:00:46.140> key<00:00:46.379> controller<00:00:46.860> and

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
your FFT control info key controller and

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.709 
your FFT control info key controller and
then<00:00:47.250> we've<00:00:47.399> got<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.610> power<00:00:47.850> cord<00:00:48.270> built<00:00:48.510> like<00:00:48.690> a

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
then we've got a power cord built like a

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.470 
then we've got a power cord built like a
standard<00:00:49.379> power<00:00:49.950> cord<00:00:50.219> for<00:00:50.370> like<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.520> CPU<00:00:51.329> of<00:00:51.390> a

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
standard power cord for like a CPU of a

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.600 
standard power cord for like a CPU of a
computer<00:00:51.930> hmm<00:00:52.289> okay<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.070> some<00:00:53.430> other

all<00:01:00.570> right<00:01:00.750> let's<00:01:01.020> see<00:01:01.260> what<00:01:01.289> what<00:01:01.890> else<00:01:02.039> is

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
all right let's see what what else is

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.460 
all right let's see what what else is
next<00:01:02.399> okay<00:01:03.000> now<00:01:03.149> we've<00:01:03.359> rolled<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.840> base<00:01:04.019> unit

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
next okay now we've rolled the base unit

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.500 
next okay now we've rolled the base unit
out<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.040> box<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.640> taken<00:01:06.119> off<00:01:06.240> some

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
out of the box and taken off some

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.910 
out of the box and taken off some
styrofoam<00:01:07.020> protectant

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
styrofoam protectant

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.500 
styrofoam protectant
looks<00:01:08.220> like<00:01:08.369> there's<00:01:08.610> there's<00:01:08.970> some

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
looks like there's there's some

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.100 
looks like there's there's some
protectant<00:01:10.470> also<00:01:10.799> on<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.299> top<00:01:12.299> cover<00:01:12.869> there

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
protectant also on the top cover there

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.320 
protectant also on the top cover there
that<00:01:13.320> will<00:01:13.500> clean<00:01:13.799> all<00:01:13.950> that<00:01:13.979> up<00:01:14.189> as<00:01:14.610> we<00:01:14.820> start

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
that will clean all that up as we start

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.390 
that will clean all that up as we start
assembling<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:15.960> okay<00:01:16.500> we've<00:01:16.680> got<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.040> lean

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
assembling it okay we've got the lean

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.130 
assembling it okay we've got the lean
steer<00:01:17.700> frame<00:01:18.030> coming<00:01:18.330> out<00:01:18.540> of<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.720> box<00:01:18.930> here

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
steer frame coming out of the box here

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.539 
steer frame coming out of the box here
you<00:01:19.170> can<00:01:19.380> see<00:01:19.560> it's<00:01:19.710> wrapped<00:01:19.950> in<00:01:20.189> bubble<00:01:20.340> wrap

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
you can see it's wrapped in bubble wrap

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.179 
you can see it's wrapped in bubble wrap
everything's<00:01:21.330> really<00:01:21.570> protected<00:01:22.229> these<00:01:23.009> are

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
everything's really protected these are

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.740 
everything's really protected these are
the<00:01:23.280> parts<00:01:23.580> that<00:01:23.790> will<00:01:23.939> make<00:01:24.119> up<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.540> lean

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
the parts that will make up the lean

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.130 
the parts that will make up the lean
steer<00:01:25.490> frame<00:01:26.490> as<00:01:26.759> he<00:01:27.000> goes<00:01:27.540> in<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:27.840> puts<00:01:28.020> this

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
steer frame as he goes in and puts this

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.990 
steer frame as he goes in and puts this
together<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.979> then<00:01:29.220> this<00:01:29.400> lean<00:01:29.640> steer

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
together and then this lean steer

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.149 
together and then this lean steer
assembly<00:01:30.570> will<00:01:30.780> be<00:01:30.960> mounted<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.979> base

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
assembly will be mounted to the base

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.850 
assembly will be mounted to the base
okay<00:01:33.000> now<00:01:33.270> we've<00:01:33.450> got<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.869> assembled<00:01:34.470> lean

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
okay now we've got the assembled lean

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.450 
okay now we've got the assembled lean
steer

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
steer

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.700 
steer
assembly<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.759> lack<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:40.020> better<00:01:40.200> word<00:01:40.500> lean

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
assembly you lack of a better word lean

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.859 
assembly you lack of a better word lean
steer<00:01:41.039> frame<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.759> then<00:01:42.360> we've<00:01:42.479> got<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.630> few

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
steer frame and then we've got a few

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.420 
steer frame and then we've got a few
more<00:01:42.960> pieces<00:01:43.200> here<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.590> we<00:01:43.860> put<00:01:44.219> it<00:01:44.310> all

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
more pieces here that we put it all

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.130 
more pieces here that we put it all
together<00:01:44.579> you'll<00:01:44.969> see<00:01:45.180> how<00:01:45.329> it<00:01:45.479> all<00:01:45.570> works<00:01:45.630> out

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
together you'll see how it all works out

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.319
