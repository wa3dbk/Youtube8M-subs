00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
remaining two pieces and I still

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:03.760 
remaining two pieces and I still
recommend<00:02:02.119> using<00:02:02.450> the<00:02:02.810> hints<00:02:03.259> even<00:02:03.590> though<00:02:03.740> I

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
recommend using the hints even though I

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.290 
recommend using the hints even though I
did<00:02:04.160> not<00:02:04.190> use<00:02:05.289> the<00:02:06.289> one<00:02:06.920> hit<00:02:07.130> here<00:02:07.550> because<00:02:08.090> it

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
did not use the one hit here because it

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.300 
did not use the one hit here because it
was<00:02:08.479> so<00:02:08.660> close<00:02:09.369> mrow<00:02:10.369> I<00:02:10.610> mean

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.120 

completely<00:02:14.310> obvious<00:02:14.460> where<00:02:14.910> it<00:02:15.090> was<00:02:15.530> done<00:02:16.530> but

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
completely obvious where it was done but

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.370 
completely obvious where it was done but
if<00:02:17.190> you're<00:02:17.520> unlike<00:02:17.910> me<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:18.330> now<00:02:18.570> this<00:02:19.020> place

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
if you're unlike me and now this place

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.580 
if you're unlike me and now this place
well<00:02:19.920> I<00:02:20.300> recommend<00:02:21.300> still<00:02:21.690> using<00:02:21.990> the<00:02:22.350> ins<00:02:22.800> and

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
well I recommend still using the ins and

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.890 
well I recommend still using the ins and
probably<00:02:25.590> you<00:02:26.580> won't<00:02:26.790> get<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.210> air<00:02:27.360> and<00:02:27.600> can

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
probably you won't get the air and can

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:36.860 
probably you won't get the air and can
your<00:02:28.080> first<00:02:28.350> try<00:02:29.660> it's<00:02:30.660> really<00:02:31.200> difficult<00:02:35.870> and

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
your first try it's really difficult and

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:43.040 
your first try it's really difficult and
I<00:02:36.990> have<00:02:37.200> trouble<00:02:37.530> with<00:02:37.860> that<00:02:40.790> no<00:02:41.790> I<00:02:42.450> have<00:02:42.870> no

looking for the Master Emerald pieces

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:20.270 
looking for the Master Emerald pieces
was<00:04:18.790> tougher<00:04:19.150> than<00:04:19.180> I<00:04:19.359> thought<00:04:19.390> it<00:04:19.660> would<00:04:19.810> be

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
was tougher than I thought it would be

into<00:04:37.990> the<00:04:38.140> limo<00:04:38.350> we<00:04:39.100> can<00:04:39.310> trace<00:04:39.550> the<00:04:39.700> call<00:04:39.910> to

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
into the limo we can trace the call to

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.690 
into the limo we can trace the call to
find<00:04:40.300> a<00:04:40.480> demon

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:41.700 
find a demon

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:49.499 
find a demon
ok<00:04:42.540> let's<00:04:43.050> meet<00:04:43.290> up<00:04:43.440> there

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:49.509 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:52.600 

okay<00:04:50.509> this<00:04:50.809> this<00:04:51.409> is<00:04:51.589> pretty<00:04:51.889> easy<00:04:52.189> once<00:04:52.339> you

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
okay this this is pretty easy once you

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.659 
okay this this is pretty easy once you
know<00:04:52.999> how<00:04:53.149> to<00:04:53.360> do<00:04:53.599> this<00:04:53.839> and<00:04:54.169> get<00:04:54.979> hang<00:04:55.490> off<00:04:55.639> the

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:55.669 
know how to do this and get hang off the

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:58.719 
know how to do this and get hang off the
controls<00:04:55.999> but<00:04:56.919> probably<00:04:57.919> this<00:04:58.159> needs<00:04:58.490> some

00:04:58.719 --> 00:04:58.729 
controls but probably this needs some

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:02.529 
controls but probably this needs some
practice<00:04:59.830> so<00:05:00.830> basically<00:05:01.729> you<00:05:01.849> accelerate

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:02.539 
practice so basically you accelerate

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:05.980 
practice so basically you accelerate
with<00:05:02.779> the<00:05:02.959> a<00:05:02.990> button<00:05:03.379> and<00:05:04.270> you<00:05:05.270> both<00:05:05.629> with<00:05:05.959> the

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
with the a button and you both with the

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:11.529 
with the a button and you both with the
Y<00:05:06.319> button<00:05:06.399> and<00:05:08.199> the<00:05:09.199> drift<00:05:09.589> you<00:05:10.300> release<00:05:11.300> the<00:05:11.509> a

00:05:11.529 --> 00:05:11.539 
Y button and the drift you release the a

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:17.529 
Y button and the drift you release the a
button<00:05:11.929> and<00:05:12.349> quickly<00:05:13.009> press<00:05:13.189> it<00:05:13.369> again<00:05:13.669> i<00:05:16.539> will

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:17.539 
button and quickly press it again i will

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:20.079 
button and quickly press it again i will
show<00:05:17.689> you<00:05:17.749> for<00:05:17.990> boost<00:05:18.169> now<00:05:18.469> there<00:05:19.429> it<00:05:19.580> was<00:05:19.729> i

00:05:20.079 --> 00:05:20.089 
show you for boost now there it was i

00:05:20.089 --> 00:05:22.629 
show you for boost now there it was i
think<00:05:20.869> when<00:05:21.020> you<00:05:21.110> get<00:05:21.229> 20<00:05:21.709> rings<00:05:21.949> you<00:05:22.219> get<00:05:22.459> the

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:22.639 
think when you get 20 rings you get the

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:25.690 
think when you get 20 rings you get the
boost

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:32.510 

at<00:05:26.700> this<00:05:26.970> drifting<00:05:27.540> it's<00:05:27.750> it's<00:05:28.020> not<00:05:28.880> too<00:05:29.880> it's

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
at this drifting it's it's not too it's

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.200 
at this drifting it's it's not too it's
it<00:05:32.819> works<00:05:33.180> but<00:05:33.509> it<00:05:33.569> could<00:05:34.229> be<00:05:34.410> better<00:05:34.440> but<00:05:35.210> this

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
it works but it could be better but this

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:42.300 
it works but it could be better but this
is<00:05:36.389> quite<00:05:36.870> fast<00:05:37.280> so<00:05:38.280> I<00:05:38.669> don't<00:05:38.970> know

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.690 

I<00:05:42.370> think<00:05:43.150> this<00:05:43.270> works<00:05:43.830> better<00:05:44.830> anyway<00:05:45.460> line

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:45.700 
I think this works better anyway line

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.550 
I think this works better anyway line
the<00:05:45.910> twinkles<00:05:46.510> I<00:05:46.630> quit<00:05:46.930> thinking<00:05:47.290> sonic

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 
the twinkles I quit thinking sonic

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.360 
the twinkles I quit thinking sonic

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:52.210 

I<00:06:49.760> found<00:06:50.360> it<00:06:50.480> how<00:06:50.660> quite<00:06:51.320> weird<00:06:51.740> how<00:06:51.920> they

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:52.220 
I found it how quite weird how they

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.700 
I found it how quite weird how they
assessed<00:06:52.640> almost<00:06:53.570> sonic<00:06:53.900> just<00:06:54.140> a<00:06:54.230> few<00:06:54.500> more

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:54.710 
assessed almost sonic just a few more

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:57.550 
assessed almost sonic just a few more
minutes<00:06:55.150> where<00:06:56.150> the<00:06:56.240> time<00:06:56.480> limit<00:06:56.810> here<00:06:57.110> even

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:57.560 
minutes where the time limit here even

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:02.400 
minutes where the time limit here even
as<00:06:57.740> a<00:06:57.770> whole<00:06:59.470> is<00:07:00.470> less<00:07:00.980> than<00:07:01.250> a<00:07:01.310> few<00:07:01.460> minutes

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:02.410 
as a whole is less than a few minutes

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:04.350 
as a whole is less than a few minutes
but

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:04.360 
but

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.239
