00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:07.330
 well here we can see all the 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.890
 equipment that we can achieve with 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:13.360
 souls of the final boss of the game 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:13.360
 we have the scythe the wish 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:21.230
 the 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.230
 for the wish 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.580
 and the arch of desire 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.420
 the truth is that it is not bad at all 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.519
 Scythe is very fast 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.539
 how are we going to see now let's put 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:39.539
 a few enemies in this area 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.160
 it's not that I marveled but I have to 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.810
 recognize that fast enough year ago 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.700
 I have the weapons without improving 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.140
 you can see that without any problem 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.329
 in front of these things 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.329
 and two hands of them 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:02.449
 then the bow the bell good 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.560
 he would need miracles and we simply 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:09.820
 allows invoking miracles and strengthens them 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:12.040
 but it is not anywhere near the best 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.330
 no longer to conjugate miracles and finally 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.220
 the bow of the bow the truth is that I do not 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.020
 like nothing 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.610
 It must be very good but I do not like anything 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.310
 simply because it changes the controls 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.040
 we have the normal shot that would be with 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.960
 we can do the r1 but to aim 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.970
 instead of using the r1 we have to use 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:32.580
 the r2 have changed it because 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.380
 the r 1 button is to make an attack 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.760
 special that I'm going to teach now against 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.690
 these enemies although I do not know if 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.580
 I will get to give them 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.010
 and what I do not like the special attack 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.750
 is that it automatically does not 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:47.870
 we can not even keep the arc 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:51.550
 tensed or manually point and neither 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.550
 is that you say it's a brutal attack 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:02:00.799
 I do not think he has spent any milk 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:03.500
 Arrows are not enough in special attack and 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:06.110
 Another problem is that you can not 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.610
 use strong arrows arrows 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.050
 Greatest hits a real bow 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.180
 like edwin's does not this thing 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.020
 a pity because for example now I'm going to 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.820
 try to press 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.640
 to aim with the bow and you'll see how 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.260
 will not let me pulse r1 try 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.569
 and not a selecting enemy 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.610
 it is automatically an attack that charges 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.050
 what has and delegates where 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.160
 What's in front of us? 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.230
 started the actions where is going to 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.110
 shoot apparently that's what 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:39.040
 do if you do not know how to control it 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:42.160
 so of the three I would have the 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.420
 scythe or maybe in the bell but 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.950
 before this desire campaign I 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.680
 I would prefer the bell that gives us what 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.910
 best of jone miracles if they have a 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.410
 site is a character based on miracles 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.890
 and what is power the blacks to 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.330
 maximum that campaign that gives you has 50 not 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.890
 like that you have a few more states 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.120
 low and what you think is more 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.190
 weak 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.670
 Well, as I said to my taste 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:07.569
 scythe 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:11.549
 is the only thing visible in such a case 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:11.549
 the souls break their soul 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.400
 a spectacular let's do your seven 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.590
 attack is typical of all life 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:25.210
 knock 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:27.360
 guard clothes and who wants to do extra 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:32.280
 besides that it spends a lot is mined 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.280
 like any kind of weapon so big 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.959
 - in the end one would expect more things 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.540
 spectacular especially the truth I 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:52.110
 I feel very enjoy for the long 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:52.110
 very disappointed i like the video
