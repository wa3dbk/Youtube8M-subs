00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
not true um what's going on is that you

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.289 
not true um what's going on is that you
boys<00:02:04.829> getting<00:02:05.159> super<00:02:05.610> sensitive<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.210> the

boys getting super sensitive to the
cardio<00:02:06.719> and<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.290> calorie<00:02:07.590> deficits

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
cardio and the to the calorie deficits

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.790 
cardio and the to the calorie deficits
ah<00:02:08.310> because<00:02:09.300> as<00:02:09.660> you<00:02:09.810> get<00:02:09.959> leaner<00:02:10.170> your<00:02:10.410> leptin

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
ah because as you get leaner your leptin

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.440 
ah because as you get leaner your leptin
levels<00:02:11.039> are<00:02:11.160> lower<00:02:11.310> which<00:02:11.790> dictates<00:02:12.300> your

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
levels are lower which dictates your

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.270 
levels are lower which dictates your
metabolism

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
metabolism

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.770

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
is to relax on to cut back on the cardio

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.490 
is to relax on to cut back on the cardio

so you know eat more calories and what's

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.320 
so you know eat more calories and what's
going<00:02:21.620> to<00:02:21.680> happen<00:02:21.770> is<00:02:22.400> a<00:02:22.430> couple<00:02:22.820> things<00:02:22.970> but

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
body fat level what's happening is your

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.460 
body fat level what's happening is your
body's<00:02:37.370> just<00:02:37.459> going<00:02:37.730> to<00:02:37.900> over<00:02:38.900> produce

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
body's just going to over produce

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.760 
body's just going to over produce
cortisol<00:02:40.010> and<00:02:40.220> cortisol<00:02:41.090> is<00:02:41.300> is<00:02:41.540> tightly<00:02:42.260> tied

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
cortisol and cortisol is is tightly tied

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.660 
cortisol and cortisol is is tightly tied
to<00:02:43.640> arm<00:02:43.970> water<00:02:44.840> retention<00:02:45.170> levels<00:02:45.650> and<00:02:45.890> so

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
to arm water retention levels and so

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.670 
to arm water retention levels and so
when<00:02:46.850> cortisol<00:02:47.330> levels<00:02:47.660> go<00:02:47.930> up<00:02:48.260> through<00:02:48.590> the

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
when cortisol levels go up through the

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.740 
when cortisol levels go up through the
roof<00:02:48.920> um<00:02:49.190> you<00:02:49.970> start<00:02:50.120> to<00:02:50.209> store<00:02:50.510> a<00:02:50.540> lot<00:02:50.720> of

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
roof um you start to store a lot of

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.390 
roof um you start to store a lot of
water<00:02:50.840> so<00:02:51.320> that's<00:02:51.410> why<00:02:51.650> his<00:02:51.770> weight<00:02:52.010> went<00:02:52.280> up

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
water so that's why his weight went up

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.460 
water so that's why his weight went up
four<00:02:52.640> pounds<00:02:52.850> despite<00:02:53.810> being<00:02:53.989> in<00:02:54.110> a<00:02:54.170> strong

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
four pounds despite being in a strong

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.620 
four pounds despite being in a strong
carry<00:02:54.739> deficit<00:02:55.160> it's<00:02:55.760> just<00:02:56.000> it's<00:02:56.239> the<00:02:56.420> water

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
carry deficit it's just it's the water

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.840 
carry deficit it's just it's the water
attention<00:02:57.170> and<00:02:57.350> so<00:02:57.830> he's<00:02:57.950> looking<00:02:58.100> puffy<00:02:58.700> and

is just to relax start to eat closer to
maintenance<00:03:07.010> level<00:03:07.459> calories<00:03:07.940> you<00:03:08.390> know

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
maintenance level calories you know

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.000 
maintenance level calories you know
bring<00:03:08.720> up<00:03:08.870> your<00:03:08.989> testosterone<00:03:09.200> and<00:03:09.770> bring<00:03:09.890> up

a<00:03:24.200> maintance<00:03:24.560> for<00:03:24.739> a<00:03:24.799> while<00:03:25.010> um<00:03:25.400> then<00:03:26.239> he<00:03:26.330> can

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
a maintance for a while um then he can

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:27.940 
a maintance for a while um then he can
start<00:03:26.630> to<00:03:26.750> put<00:03:26.900> himself<00:03:27.049> give<00:03:27.500> himself<00:03:27.650> into<00:03:27.920> a

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
start to put himself give himself into a

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.920 
start to put himself give himself into a
slight<00:03:28.340> calorie<00:03:28.760> deficit<00:03:29.060> not<00:03:29.570> a<00:03:29.600> huge

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
slight calorie deficit not a huge

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.900 
slight calorie deficit not a huge
calorie<00:03:30.200> deficit<00:03:30.650> so<00:03:31.130> when<00:03:31.250> he<00:03:31.310> was<00:03:31.370> taking<00:03:31.790> in

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
calorie deficit so when he was taking in

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.960 
calorie deficit so when he was taking in
probably<00:03:32.450> 1200<00:03:33.049> calories<00:03:33.470> a<00:03:33.530> day<00:03:33.620> you<00:03:34.549> start

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
probably 1200 calories a day you start

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.110 
probably 1200 calories a day you start
to<00:03:35.090> go<00:03:35.180> down<00:03:35.360> to<00:03:35.600> maybe<00:03:36.010> 1,800<00:03:37.010> um<00:03:37.190> this<00:03:37.970> is<00:03:38.090> a

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
to go down to maybe 1,800 um this is a

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.120 
to go down to maybe 1,800 um this is a
guy<00:03:38.239> that's<00:03:38.390> around<00:03:38.570> 160<00:03:39.320> hundred<00:03:39.530> 70<00:03:39.769> pounds

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
guy that's around 160 hundred 70 pounds

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:44.800 
guy that's around 160 hundred 70 pounds
so<00:03:40.820> uh<00:03:41.920> so<00:03:42.920> really<00:03:43.100> that's<00:03:43.549> the<00:03:43.820> best<00:03:44.450> way<00:03:44.780> to

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
so uh so really that's the best way to

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.440 
so uh so really that's the best way to
go<00:03:45.110> about<00:03:45.200> it<00:03:45.470> and<00:03:45.560> this<00:03:46.040> issue<00:03:46.310> is<00:03:46.579> so<00:03:46.880> fucking

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
go about it and this issue is so fucking

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:49.720 
go about it and this issue is so fucking
important<00:03:47.989> because<00:03:48.310> you<00:03:49.310> know<00:03:49.400> this<00:03:49.519> is<00:03:49.610> why

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
important because you know this is why

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.610 
important because you know this is why
no<00:03:49.790> one<00:03:50.060> gets<00:03:50.390> like<00:03:50.540> that<00:03:50.690> lean<00:03:51.019> lean<00:03:51.290> state

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
no one gets like that lean lean state

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.470 
no one gets like that lean lean state
because<00:03:52.370> as<00:03:52.579> they<00:03:52.730> get<00:03:52.880> close<00:03:53.060> to<00:03:53.180> the<00:03:53.269> goal

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
because as they get close to the goal

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.660 
because as they get close to the goal
they<00:03:54.049> get<00:03:54.230> stuck<00:03:54.590> when<00:03:55.040> they<00:03:55.130> get<00:03:55.280> stuck<00:03:55.519> they

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 
they get stuck when they get stuck they

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:56.800 
they get stuck when they get stuck they
want<00:03:55.820> to<00:03:55.880> die<00:03:56.030> harder<00:03:56.360> the<00:03:56.450> one<00:03:56.540> do<00:03:56.630> more

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
want to die harder the one do more

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.229 
want to die harder the one do more
cardio<00:03:57.019> and<00:03:57.320> that<00:03:57.769> is<00:03:57.920> what<00:03:58.100> is<00:03:58.280> exacerbating

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.239 
cardio and that is what is exacerbating

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.360 
cardio and that is what is exacerbating
the<00:03:59.360> issue<00:03:59.450> and<00:03:59.840> so<00:04:00.320> they<00:04:00.500> started<00:04:00.799> they<00:04:01.190> start

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
the issue and so they started they start

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:02.319 
the issue and so they started they start
to<00:04:01.459> like<00:04:01.579> you<00:04:01.730> know<00:04:01.820> the<00:04:01.910> weight<00:04:02.090> goes<00:04:02.299> up

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:02.329 
to like you know the weight goes up

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:03.670 
to like you know the weight goes up
because<00:04:02.630> they<00:04:02.720> got<00:04:02.840> more<00:04:03.019> water<00:04:03.200> attention<00:04:03.620> I

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
because they got more water attention I

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.160 
because they got more water attention I
look<00:04:03.829> worse<00:04:04.100> and<00:04:04.340> the<00:04:05.269> only<00:04:05.660> logical<00:04:06.110> solution

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.170 
look worse and the only logical solution

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.229 
look worse and the only logical solution
in<00:04:06.530> mine<00:04:06.739> is<00:04:06.860> like<00:04:06.980> oh<00:04:07.130> you<00:04:07.670> know<00:04:07.790> I<00:04:08.000> just<00:04:08.030> got
