00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.140
 good two fears to a new good video 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.879
 you know all the problem that we are 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.160
 having with gta online many people are 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.830
 is complaining logically we are already at 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.380
 a day 8 good to remember that a lot of game 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.950
 it came out on day 1 and really yes it is 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.410
 normal 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.750
 to complain seems totally logical to me and 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.520
 It also seems to me a little bit that 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.230
 rockstar because it has stuck a little bit 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.910
 surprise they did not think they were going to have 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.360
 so much public in the multiplayer 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.390
 since you keep eyes because you have not had 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.280
 so absolute majority of people playing 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.680
 really you also have to say in 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.060
 certain point that is a bit also not 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.800
 is an excuse is not an excuse because 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.060
 they knew what they had sold they opened 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.310
 the eyes that had sold I think that 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.420
 neither that excuse and good we want 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.830
 know in the end what ends up happening 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.600
 for now because they have given us some 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.610
 How many tips not to lose the 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.440
 character this kind of thing said this 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.610
 kind of things and they have basically said 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.590
 who are working on a patch to 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.270
 recover all objects and such that 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.480
 we have lost the players and this guy 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.890
 of things not basically also the in 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.890
 a few tips I will say 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.240
 right now not because I really do 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.009
 it's true that how good they are 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.560
 losing characters almost everyone 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:09.350
 and basically because there is a way that 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.910
 this does not happen not a little to soften it 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.100
 basically, what they say is that 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.050
 let's keep a character and I who know 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.600
 suddenly it will not be the work or empty 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.149
 go back to story mode and go back to 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.520
 and re-select the character if 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:23.869
 we see that it really does not appear 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.580
 repeat again until until 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.140
 mount no and above all not 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.119
 overwrite that character since what 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.100
 we will definitely lose 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:33.290
 patches do not have a patch so good 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:36.470
 because he made the mistake that you have a 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.180
 the high level you see already written that 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.980
 character because he does not really appear 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.290
 eye always appear the last one that you 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.360
 you have also created one of the 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.060
 advice they give not to lose in 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.190
 no type of game or anything is that if 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.420
 For example, we received a message from the 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.520
 rockstar servers that are not 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.229
 available as we basically do not give you 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.000
 when trying but return to story mode 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.680
 and then again then try to get us 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.050
 do not ever give it to re try to go back 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.030
 because it seems that it seems that this is how it is 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.150
 when those who would be the 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.770
 characters not in multiplayer mode 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.300
 so good nothing else I have nothing left 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.220
 rather than tell the truth many people 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.290
 is complaining on my channel because I do not say 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.760
 none of this I really is roxas the 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.250
 you have to put your bit 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.810
 and say what is happening at the minute 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.310
 do not usually update a page like this 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.780
 service but really it is 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.880
 it updates every bit and every little bit goes 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.830
 saying few things we will see how it arrives 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.600
 and soon the patch the truth that they are 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.070
 having pretty ugly rumors like that 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.780
 they're going to restart all the multiplayer or 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.280
 be all the progress and such is 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.630
 they would lose but for now it's a rumor and 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.070
 nothing else that's why I did not want to make a 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.160
 video alarming people for now not 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.660
 they go to the restart 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.520
 but it is true that I have seen it 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:39.900
 for some somewhere but nothing 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.320
 official so good we'll see to see what 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:46.020
 that ends up happening or nothing because 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.210
 enjoy a little of the game 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.440
 valuing a bit what is the mode 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:51.840
 multiplayer I'm liking 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.340
 pretty much what little I can play and the 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.900
 approach is correct in certain 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.550
 to some extent not but really 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.040
 because this type of failures are therefore a 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.480
 little unforgivable until certain is 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.760
 another point, not really, it's just 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.680
 forgive with the campaign mode so good 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.910
 Game really is so 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.530
 well nothing more kids this has been 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.530
 all we will see the next video
