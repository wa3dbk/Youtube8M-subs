00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:10.370 
okay I'm just going to prepare my galaxy

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.359 
okay I'm just going to prepare my galaxy
pop<00:00:10.580> for<00:00:11.000> dry<00:00:11.930> hopping<00:00:12.320> so<00:00:13.010> what<00:00:13.129> I've<00:00:13.219> got

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:13.369 
pop for dry hopping so what I've got

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:15.250 
pop for dry hopping so what I've got
here<00:00:13.549> is<00:00:13.610> a<00:00:13.730> piece<00:00:14.029> of<00:00:14.059> Muslim<00:00:14.840> has<00:00:14.990> been

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:15.260 
here is a piece of Muslim has been

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.189 
here is a piece of Muslim has been
sterilized<00:00:15.980> in<00:00:16.369> some<00:00:16.640> boiling<00:00:16.850> water<00:00:17.199> that

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:18.199 
sterilized in some boiling water that

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:20.710 
sterilized in some boiling water that
I'm<00:00:18.500> just<00:00:18.770> going<00:00:18.980> to<00:00:19.039> hold<00:00:19.250> in<00:00:19.539> such<00:00:20.539> the

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
I'm just going to hold in such the

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.659 
I'm just going to hold in such the
grounds<00:00:21.230> of<00:00:21.400> galaxy<00:00:22.429> hop<00:00:22.609> pellets<00:00:24.369> goes<00:00:25.369> into

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:25.669 
grounds of galaxy hop pellets goes into

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:31.689 
grounds of galaxy hop pellets goes into
the<00:00:25.789> center<00:00:26.210> here<00:00:26.390> like<00:00:26.599> that<00:00:30.279> this<00:00:31.279> is<00:00:31.339> 100

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:31.699 
the center here like that this is 100

00:00:31.699 --> 00:01:05.439 
the center here like that this is 100
grand<00:00:31.909> bag<00:00:32.150> so<00:00:32.450> I'm<00:00:32.509> just<00:00:32.630> going<00:01:03.519> okay<00:01:04.519> so

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
grand bag so I'm just going okay so

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.669 
grand bag so I'm just going okay so
that's<00:01:05.659> the<00:01:05.840> 50<00:01:06.200> grams<00:01:06.999> hop<00:01:07.999> pellets<00:01:08.679> just

00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:09.679 
that's the 50 grams hop pellets just

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:14.550 
that's the 50 grams hop pellets just
basically<00:01:10.340> pull<00:01:10.729> up<00:01:10.880> the<00:01:11.090> corners<00:01:11.570> like<00:01:12.609> so<00:01:13.609> up

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
basically pull up the corners like so up

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.679 
basically pull up the corners like so up
another<00:01:15.560> trip<00:01:15.939> when<00:01:16.939> you<00:01:17.030> dry<00:01:17.270> hopping

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689 
another trip when you dry hopping

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:20.649 
another trip when you dry hopping
pellets<00:01:18.200> if<00:01:19.130> you<00:01:19.460> just<00:01:19.609> check<00:01:19.850> the<00:01:20.090> pellets<00:01:20.539> in

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
pellets if you just check the pellets in

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:22.300 
pellets if you just check the pellets in
like<00:01:20.840> that<00:01:21.049> they'll<00:01:21.289> float<00:01:21.530> on<00:01:21.740> the<00:01:21.829> top<00:01:22.069> but

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
like that they'll float on the top but

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.969 
like that they'll float on the top but
if<00:01:22.399> you<00:01:22.490> put<00:01:22.729> in<00:01:22.850> a<00:01:22.939> weight<00:01:23.179> this<00:01:23.569> is<00:01:23.749> a<00:01:23.780> stood<00:01:24.710> a

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
if you put in a weight this is a stood a

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.370 
if you put in a weight this is a stood a
metal<00:01:25.880> weight<00:01:26.539> that<00:01:26.749> I'm<00:01:26.840> putting<00:01:27.020> in<00:01:27.200> it's

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
metal weight that I'm putting in it's

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.950 
metal weight that I'm putting in it's
been<00:01:27.530> sterilized<00:01:28.100> as<00:01:28.280> well<00:01:28.600> check<00:01:29.600> that<00:01:29.840> in

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
been sterilized as well check that in

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.279 
been sterilized as well check that in
the<00:01:30.049> middle<00:01:30.789> that's<00:01:31.789> going<00:01:31.999> to<00:01:32.090> wait<00:01:32.299> the<00:01:32.539> bag

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289 
the middle that's going to wait the bag

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:37.539 
the middle that's going to wait the bag
down<00:01:34.689> so<00:01:35.689> that<00:01:35.869> the<00:01:36.049> oils<00:01:36.920> from<00:01:37.130> the<00:01:37.219> hops

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
down so that the oils from the hops

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:39.450 
down so that the oils from the hops
actually<00:01:38.060> distribute<00:01:38.659> through<00:01:39.109> the

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
actually distribute through the

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.249 
actually distribute through the
fermenting<00:01:40.460> barrel<00:01:40.850> better<00:01:41.600> rather<00:01:41.960> than<00:01:42.079> the

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
fermenting barrel better rather than the

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.489 
fermenting barrel better rather than the
hot<00:01:42.409> bag<00:01:42.619> sitting<00:01:42.979> on<00:01:43.069> the<00:01:43.189> top<00:01:44.139> get<00:01:45.139> four

00:01:45.489 --> 00:01:45.499 
hot bag sitting on the top get four

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:50.230 
hot bag sitting on the top get four
corners<00:01:45.979> like<00:01:46.189> that<00:01:48.850> I've<00:01:49.850> got<00:01:49.969> to<00:01:50.060> put<00:01:50.209> a

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
corners like that I've got to put a

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.029 
corners like that I've got to put a
string<00:01:50.920> tie<00:01:51.920> them<00:01:52.189> around<00:01:53.409> base<00:01:54.409> you<00:01:54.799> just

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:55.039 
string tie them around base you just

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:02.200 
string tie them around base you just
made<00:01:55.249> a<00:01:55.280> little<00:01:56.240> parcel

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:11.059 

you<00:02:03.210> go<00:02:03.510> do<00:02:03.930> that<00:02:03.960> up<00:02:04.400> reasonably<00:02:05.400> tight<00:02:10.069> you

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
you go do that up reasonably tight you

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.570 
you go do that up reasonably tight you
go<00:02:12.560> there's<00:02:13.560> a<00:02:13.650> little<00:02:13.680> bit<00:02:13.980> of<00:02:14.010> room<00:02:14.250> in<00:02:14.400> there

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
go there's a little bit of room in there

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.970 
go there's a little bit of room in there
because<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.300> pallets<00:02:15.690> will<00:02:15.900> swell<00:02:16.319> as

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
because the the pallets will swell as

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.380 
because the the pallets will swell as
they<00:02:17.190> absorb<00:02:17.489> liquid<00:02:19.790> so<00:02:20.790> they<00:02:20.910> took<00:02:21.120> we're

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
they absorb liquid so they took we're

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:27.740 
they absorb liquid so they took we're
ready<00:02:21.569> to<00:02:21.750> go<00:02:25.220> if<00:02:26.220> you<00:02:26.520> saw<00:02:26.940> earlier<00:02:27.239> I<00:02:27.510> put

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
ready to go if you saw earlier I put

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.699 
ready to go if you saw earlier I put
some<00:02:28.020> 50<00:02:28.770> grams<00:02:28.980> of<00:02:29.250> galaxy<00:02:29.970> hop<00:02:30.930> pellets<00:02:31.200> into

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
some 50 grams of galaxy hop pellets into

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.460 
some 50 grams of galaxy hop pellets into
this<00:02:32.209> muslin<00:02:33.209> cloth<00:02:33.360> and<00:02:33.750> tied<00:02:33.959> it<00:02:34.110> up<00:02:34.260> and

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
this muslin cloth and tied it up and

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.199 
this muslin cloth and tied it up and
it's<00:02:34.800> got<00:02:34.920> two<00:02:35.010> gotta<00:02:35.430> wait<00:02:35.640> in<00:02:35.820> there<00:02:35.940> so

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
it's got two gotta wait in there so

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.040 
it's got two gotta wait in there so
we'll<00:02:36.360> check<00:02:36.570> that<00:02:36.630> in<00:02:38.480> it's<00:02:39.480> going<00:02:39.690> to<00:02:39.750> sink

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
we'll check that in it's going to sink

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:49.030 
we'll check that in it's going to sink
yep<00:02:40.500> there<00:02:40.830> it<00:02:41.010> goes

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.099 

you
