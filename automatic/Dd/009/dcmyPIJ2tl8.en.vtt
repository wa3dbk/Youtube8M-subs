00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
twin spark v8 engine and so that's two

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.619 
twin spark v8 engine and so that's two
platinum<00:00:40.290> tip<00:00:40.739> spark<00:00:41.129> plugs<00:00:41.399> at<00:00:41.730> every<00:00:42.270> piston

location and so though the spark plugs
last<00:00:45.360> 100,000<00:00:46.170> miles<00:00:46.289> I<00:00:46.500> could<00:00:46.770> imagine<00:00:46.950> that

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
last 100,000 miles I could imagine that

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.799 
last 100,000 miles I could imagine that
that<00:00:47.670> hundred<00:00:47.940> thousand<00:00:48.270> mile<00:00:48.360> service<00:00:48.719> is

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
that hundred thousand mile service is

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.130 
that hundred thousand mile service is
probably<00:00:48.989> just<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.920> little<00:00:50.160> bit<00:00:50.280> spendy<00:00:50.579> but<00:00:50.879> at

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
probably just a little bit spendy but at

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.660 
probably just a little bit spendy but at
57,000<00:00:52.140> miles<00:00:52.289> that's<00:00:52.920> something<00:00:53.309> way<00:00:53.489> off

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
57,000 miles that's something way off

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.819 
57,000 miles that's something way off
into<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.090> distant<00:00:54.449> future<00:00:54.600> also<00:00:55.320> whenever

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
into the distant future also whenever

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.889 
into the distant future also whenever
you<00:00:55.920> see<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.100> car<00:00:56.370> with<00:00:56.399> very<00:00:57.180> very<00:00:57.360> low<00:00:57.629> miles

so<00:01:41.130> because<00:01:41.520> they<00:01:41.729> have<00:01:41.759> robots<00:01:42.360> that<00:01:42.630> one

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
so because they have robots that one

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.080 
so because they have robots that one
robot<00:01:43.380> can<00:01:43.590> be<00:01:43.710> going<00:01:44.189> along<00:01:44.430> this<00:01:44.610> path<00:01:44.850> and

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
robot can be going along this path and

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.520 
robot can be going along this path and
another<00:01:45.180> can<00:01:45.600> be<00:01:45.720> going<00:01:45.869> along<00:01:46.140> this<00:01:46.320> path

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
another can be going along this path

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.319 
another can be going along this path
they<00:01:46.950> can<00:01:47.130> have<00:01:47.250> two<00:01:47.460> different<00:01:47.490> paint

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
they can have two different paint

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.480 
they can have two different paint
formulas<00:01:48.899> working<00:01:49.290> at<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.530> same<00:01:49.710> time<00:01:49.979> at<00:01:50.430> a

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
formulas working at the same time at a

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.700 
formulas working at the same time at a
body<00:01:50.759> shop<00:01:51.060> they've<00:01:51.450> just<00:01:51.750> got<00:01:51.930> one<00:01:52.140> person<00:01:52.380> in

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
body shop they've just got one person in

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.620 
body shop they've just got one person in
there<00:01:52.829> spraying<00:01:53.189> for<00:01:53.549> as<00:01:53.880> best<00:01:54.119> they<00:01:54.210> can<00:01:54.450> and
