00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
really worried at the start it is quite

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.980 
really worried at the start it is quite
heavy<00:02:43.320> in<00:02:43.680> it's<00:02:43.950> sort<00:02:44.280> of<00:02:44.570> classics<00:02:45.570> and<00:02:45.810> it's

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
heavy in it's sort of classics and it's

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.720 
heavy in it's sort of classics and it's
Greek<00:02:46.380> and<00:02:46.650> it's<00:02:46.770> Latin<00:02:47.160> and<00:02:47.250> all<00:02:47.370> that<00:02:47.520> kind

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
Greek and it's Latin and all that kind

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.550 
Greek and it's Latin and all that kind
of<00:02:47.790> thing<00:02:47.850> and<00:02:48.120> that<00:02:48.240> is<00:02:48.270> definitely<00:02:49.140> not<00:02:49.260> my

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
of thing and that is definitely not my

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.500 
of thing and that is definitely not my
area<00:02:50.040> of<00:02:50.220> expertise<00:02:50.850> so<00:02:51.060> I<00:02:51.120> was<00:02:51.240> worried<00:02:51.480> that

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
area of expertise so I was worried that

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.480 
area of expertise so I was worried that
it<00:02:51.720> was<00:02:51.780> going<00:02:51.990> to<00:02:52.110> keep<00:02:52.290> alluding<00:02:53.190> to<00:02:53.310> those

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
it was going to keep alluding to those

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:54.949 
it was going to keep alluding to those
sort<00:02:53.820> of<00:02:53.880> things<00:02:54.090> but<00:02:54.360> it<00:02:54.510> doesn't<00:02:54.840> it

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
sort of things but it doesn't it

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.960 
sort of things but it doesn't it
definitely<00:02:55.410> doesn't<00:02:55.620> it<00:02:55.800> sort<00:02:56.040> of<00:02:56.100> builds<00:02:56.430> on

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
definitely doesn't it sort of builds on

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.300 
definitely doesn't it sort of builds on
those<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:57.990> ideas<00:02:58.440> brother<00:02:58.800> button<00:02:59.160> those

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
those and the ideas brother button those

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.220
