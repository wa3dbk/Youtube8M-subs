00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.520 
according to this it's just because of
the<00:02:50.440> Mech<00:02:50.680> Tech<00:02:50.940> but<00:02:51.940> I'm<00:02:52.239> not<00:02:52.900> really<00:02:53.140> liking

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
the Mech Tech but I'm not really liking

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.119 
the Mech Tech but I'm not really liking
that<00:02:53.859> down<00:02:54.220> skill<00:02:54.549> whole<00:02:55.090> thing<00:02:55.329> but<00:02:56.129> let's

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:57.129 
that down skill whole thing but let's

00:02:57.129 --> 00:02:59.520 
that down skill whole thing but let's
see<00:02:57.370> where<00:02:57.519> else<00:02:57.609> they<00:02:57.760> can<00:02:57.819> clear<00:02:58.120> up<00:02:58.530> so

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
see where else they can clear up so

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.930 
see where else they can clear up so
let's<00:02:59.829> get<00:02:59.980> on<00:03:00.129> with<00:03:00.160> transformation<00:03:00.790> Oh

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
let's get on with transformation Oh

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.550 
let's get on with transformation Oh
transformations<00:03:01.870> quakes<00:03:02.079> up<00:03:02.230> on<00:03:02.349> this<00:03:02.470> guy

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
transformations quakes up on this guy

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.740 
transformations quakes up on this guy
it's<00:03:02.980> basically<00:03:03.700> first<00:03:04.030> what<00:03:04.180> you<00:03:04.209> want<00:03:04.510> to<00:03:04.599> do

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
it's basically first what you want to do

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.199 
it's basically first what you want to do
is<00:03:05.519> take<00:03:06.519> this<00:03:06.870> from<00:03:07.870> sides<00:03:08.640> free<00:03:09.640> mount<00:03:09.910> Popa

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
is take this from sides free mount Popa

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:15.990 
is take this from sides free mount Popa
Malik<00:03:10.660> so<00:03:12.209> up<00:03:13.209> about<00:03:13.480> again<00:03:14.700> pop<00:03:15.700> them<00:03:15.879> out

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
Malik so up about again pop them out

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.020 
Malik so up about again pop them out
just<00:03:16.599> to<00:03:16.780> make<00:03:16.930> it<00:03:16.959> look<00:03:17.079> like<00:03:17.290> that<00:03:18.030> makes

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
just to make it look like that makes

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:26.099 
just to make it look like that makes
what<00:03:19.239> you<00:03:19.329> want<00:03:19.480> to<00:03:19.569> do<00:03:19.720> is<00:03:20.940> extend<00:03:21.940> this<00:03:25.109> untap

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
what you want to do is extend this untap

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:29.729 
what you want to do is extend this untap
that<00:03:27.359> he'll<00:03:28.359> be<00:03:28.810> on<00:03:28.989> tapped<00:03:29.230> on<00:03:29.380> the<00:03:29.410> bottom

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
that he'll be on tapped on the bottom

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.530 
that he'll be on tapped on the bottom
right<00:03:29.889> there<00:03:30.130> as<00:03:30.609> a<00:03:30.669> little<00:03:30.970> pegs<00:03:31.180> right<00:03:31.389> there

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
right there as a little pegs right there

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.539 
right there as a little pegs right there
don't<00:03:31.780> tap<00:03:32.430> so<00:03:33.430> on<00:03:33.730> tab<00:03:33.970> them<00:03:35.160> bring<00:03:36.160> this<00:03:36.310> up

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
don't tap so on tab them bring this up

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:40.379 
don't tap so on tab them bring this up
while<00:03:37.000> you<00:03:37.150> can<00:03:37.389> right<00:03:37.630> now<00:03:39.060> give<00:03:40.060> it<00:03:40.150> a<00:03:40.180> little

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:40.389 
while you can right now give it a little

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:46.259 
while you can right now give it a little
tug<00:03:40.750> from<00:03:41.560> them<00:03:41.739> back<00:03:41.950> here<00:03:41.980> and<00:03:44.819> its<00:03:45.819> feet<00:03:46.120> are

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
tug from them back here and its feet are

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:48.120 
tug from them back here and its feet are
in<00:03:46.389> there<00:03:46.569> so<00:03:46.810> you<00:03:47.169> have<00:03:47.290> a<00:03:47.319> nice<00:03:47.590> little<00:03:47.799> tug

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
in there so you have a nice little tug

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.520 
in there so you have a nice little tug
and<00:03:48.370> not<00:03:48.940> the<00:03:49.120> feet<00:03:49.269> come<00:03:49.419> up<00:03:49.569> the<00:03:50.169> feet<00:03:50.380> are

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
and not the feet come up the feet are

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.030 
and not the feet come up the feet are
pretty<00:03:50.889> simple<00:03:51.190> so<00:03:51.730> you<00:03:52.150> might<00:03:52.299> just<00:03:52.480> want<00:03:52.720> to

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
pretty simple so you might just want to

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.890 
pretty simple so you might just want to
split<00:03:54.040> that<00:03:54.250> put<00:03:54.609> that<00:03:54.760> in<00:03:54.849> position<00:03:56.489> like<00:03:57.489> so

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
split that put that in position like so

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:04.729 
split that put that in position like so
and<00:03:58.980> after<00:03:59.980> that<00:04:01.139> rotate<00:04:02.139> is<00:04:02.260> 360<00:04:03.040> the<00:04:03.190> waist

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
and after that rotate is 360 the waist

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.470 
and after that rotate is 360 the waist
you<00:04:05.739> put<00:04:05.980> it<00:04:06.069> in<00:04:06.160> there<00:04:06.340> you'll<00:04:06.730> you'll<00:04:07.239> hear<00:04:07.450> a

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
you put it in there you'll you'll hear a

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.759 
you put it in there you'll you'll hear a
nice<00:04:07.629> little<00:04:07.840> pop<00:04:08.370> and<00:04:10.319> they'll<00:04:11.319> indicate

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
nice little pop and they'll indicate

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.809 
nice little pop and they'll indicate
that<00:04:11.799> it's<00:04:12.099> locked<00:04:12.430> in<00:04:12.639> and<00:04:13.359> good<00:04:13.660> for

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:14.819 
that it's locked in and good for

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:16.970 
that it's locked in and good for
extending

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:16.980 
extending

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:23.420 
extending
so<00:04:17.610> now<00:04:17.760> what<00:04:17.880> you<00:04:18.000> want<00:04:18.150> to<00:04:18.180> do<00:04:18.330> is<00:04:22.280> hold<00:04:23.280> this

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
so now what you want to do is hold this

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:29.980 
so now what you want to do is hold this
backwards<00:04:24.950> bring<00:04:25.950> the<00:04:26.250> arms<00:04:26.610> forward<00:04:27.470> like<00:04:28.470> so

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
backwards bring the arms forward like so

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
backwards bring the arms forward like so
bring<00:04:30.990> them<00:04:31.080> forward<00:04:31.320> like<00:04:31.980> so<00:04:33.830> bend<00:04:34.830> this

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:35.010 
bring them forward like so bend this

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.510 
bring them forward like so bend this
down<00:04:35.390> we<00:04:36.390> will<00:04:36.600> take<00:04:36.840> the<00:04:36.990> headpiece<00:04:37.520> will

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
down we will take the headpiece will

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.560 
down we will take the headpiece will
take<00:04:38.730> this<00:04:39.060> chest<00:04:39.510> chest<00:04:40.410> piece<00:04:40.680> down<00:04:41.390> to<00:04:42.390> the

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
take this chest chest piece down to the

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:48.050 
take this chest chest piece down to the
soul<00:04:43.470> you<00:04:43.740> have<00:04:43.770> to<00:04:45.890> detach<00:04:46.890> the<00:04:47.400> robot<00:04:47.820> mode

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
soul you have to detach the robot mode

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.770 
soul you have to detach the robot mode
chest<00:04:49.250> they<00:04:50.250> transformed<00:04:50.730> it<00:04:50.850> pay<00:04:51.570> it<00:04:51.690> in

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:51.780 
chest they transformed it pay it in

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:59.780 
chest they transformed it pay it in
there<00:04:53.570> basically<00:04:55.400> very<00:04:56.400> key<00:04:56.730> it's<00:04:57.090> done<00:04:58.790> just

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
there basically very key it's done just

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.190 
there basically very key it's done just
