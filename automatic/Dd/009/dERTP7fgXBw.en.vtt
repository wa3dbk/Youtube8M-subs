00:00:09.279 --> 00:00:11.819
 for the laval to let believe 

00:00:11.819 --> 00:00:14.819
 and I chose your language 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.199
 you go to the homepage of maths game 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.989
 if you play for the first time 

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:22.819

 then click on the login button 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.610
 you see your personal maths page appear 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.380
 to start a game 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.380

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.270
 to continue 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.409
 we must now create a table that is to say 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:17.480
 a part 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.560
 click on new tables 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.560
 and I chose azouri from the earth is that you want to play 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.960
 rather than creating a table you can join a table 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.180
 existing 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.300
 when tablets already exist 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.300
 they have shows at invesco 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.390
 you must now choose the character who will represent you in 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:39.880
 the game 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.880
 use the arrows to scroll through the available characters 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.730
 each of them has its own animation effects 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.510
 after making your choice click continue 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.410
 faymann waited for other players to see your table 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.630
 at any time 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.920
 click continue to start the game 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.680
 when you play alone 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.680
 so I expect you will provide opponents of the resources 

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:15.929
 henri this article 

00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:18.929
 you're on the board with your opponents 

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:22.080
 this board is a kind of little pumpkin 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.369
 formed of deficiency of different colors 

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:28.609
 suck the arrows at the bottom of the screen to propose this one did both 

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:29.539
 elections 

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:32.539
 and if discover the extent of your universe 

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:39.819
 each party does not wait for me game is unique 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.419
 the playful and constructive surface to thouars fed up and over the party is 

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:43.960
 long 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.429
 more this one than the big ones 

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:47.909
 to earn points 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:50.479
 you have to move on this surface 

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:51.490
 at each step 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.490
 three characters all these moves have each of the four sections 

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:58.369
 arias 

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:02.079
 accessible deficiencies appear in January 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:05.079
 make your choice and click on the desired box 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.559
 to succeed ranking vote 

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:12.569
 you have to answer a math question well be careful 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:15.929
 some questions are multiple choice 

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:17.260
 others ask for a number 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.719
 ouf not a word 

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:21.209
 to check your answer 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.589
 select the letter further called the appropriate word 

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:28.279
 when you have the right answer two characters move to the holidays 

00:03:28.279 --> 00:03:30.089
 Soitec 

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:31.399
 your score 

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:33.069
 hidden at the top of the screen 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:36.099
 and that a kid twenty-six years of the ride the question you just 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:37.839
 succeed 

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:40.929
 this value depends on the distance you have traveled 

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:42.509
 longer trips and om 

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:44.269
 the more the difficult question 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.269
 and more she reports 

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:49.209
 if on the contrary 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:50.509
 you are deceived 

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:53.499
 the feedbacks linger and explains how to find the right one 

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:55.419
 reply 

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:58.419
 each of the math questions in play has its pop retro action 

00:03:59.399 --> 00:04:02.559
 you must wait a minimum of 15 seconds before resuming play 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:04.140
 and of course 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.679
 to stay that you were 

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:09.789
 this spokesperson the questions could rise are adapted to 

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:10.959
 each player 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.589
 each question has an exculpatory and independent rating 

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:17.589
 and for each grade level 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:19.989
 we play in the game cube 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.989
 the measier to jo who will award or the university 

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:26.520
 while the other day 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.720
 you might have noticed that you have the end will have moved 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.759
 indeed, there is no turning to wait for me 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:35.180
 everyone does not play his investigation 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.879
 and simultaneously 

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:40.270
 so it's hazebrouck to determine his strategy to gain the maximum of 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.809
 points 

00:04:40.809 --> 00:04:43.490
 within the time allowed 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.490
 but not surprise identified by a question mark 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:50.080
 are another place as much chance tinker 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.219
 choosing his deficiencies 

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:55.389
 if you change read a few moments a nice little owl game 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:57.809
 reflection or press 

00:04:57.809 --> 00:05:00.719
 some of them are known to mathematics and allow you to 

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:03.199
 earn other points 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:05.020
 through this web portal 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.309
 I changed your personal information 

00:05:07.309 --> 00:05:09.029
 change your level will be there 

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:12.349
 and we wanted your statistics 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:15.679
 teachers one is kid a special access allowing them input their 

00:05:15.679 --> 00:05:17.879
 own questions in the database 

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:21.279
 and I know that I read match without stake as also of revision or 

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:24.279
 learning with their students 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:27.669
 now I put a project in constant evolution 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:30.629
 and this request will be if we only served to show you a small number of 

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:32.909
 its possibilities 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:35.270
 all you have to do is enjoy our plate 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.159
 do not try or hurt 

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:37.839
 good luck
