00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.580
 we have again what is new and although 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.179
 a universal magnetic 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.040
 ventilation grille is a dreamless 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:12.630
 principle is simply explained you push 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.309
 the part of your fan grid can 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.440
 you two biggest for thick air room for 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.029
 thin fan grille and then you hold 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.650
 actually what that means in two 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.359
 sizes here i just see a bigger one 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.430
 Two so thin slit are so long 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.470
 a little thicker slicer ok I see 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.910
 but okay okay then I'll take it 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.039
 Thinner slit I would say so 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.330
 and in most cases exactly me 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.349
 that just so I stared away 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.030
 Thinking up here keeps that kind of 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.809
 better so that does not bother so much here 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.739
 yes that looks pretty tight 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.020
 and what have I got her I have two 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.500
 flake two metal plates into the 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.149
 make the magic 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.800
 I think you just put them in yes 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.780
 the envelope know the name but right 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.879
 stick in if you want and so 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.620
 exactly and then just the envelope on it 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.870
 and I already have yes and now 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.899
 of course, hold on and disintegrate 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.219
 perfect wonderful here is the variant 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.050
 to glue that means I can do it 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.239
 just pull off and then on the back 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.339
 to live smartphone by telling him directly 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.750
 on smartphones as well in the envelope purely 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.640
 but you can stick it too if you do 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.350
 A Samsung cellphone, for example, has that 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.670
 Battery cover down on the battery 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.040
 glue on it and cover it up 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.119
 you look thoughtful okay too 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.200
 not bad yes good because see here 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.030
 you do not because it's in 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.170
 my hand in this case a nitro 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.880
 case so and now bombproof and yes 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.740
 So it always feels so strong 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.829
 magnet and of course I have 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.689
 free view of the street and yes one 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.790
 very good way to make the whole thing 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.000
 except a circumferential bracket or 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.220
 really just not sure if 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.960
 you here again just as if it 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.229
 a little better so everything is clear 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.579
 yes so survived also been so stuttering 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.590
 and so the whole point to inter 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.420
 took hold tomorrow and so yes 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.710
 wonderfully okay here is of course 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.909
 a display but I do not care 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.799
 use a bit higher but 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.869
 a stylish bracket does not cost 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.340
 a lot so a cheap variant everyone 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.560
 Good conversation with free 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.560
 view on the street and now still usd
