00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
the day of the test and sometimes you

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.400 
the day of the test and sometimes you
just<00:02:18.440> can't<00:02:18.680> think<00:02:18.980> so<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:20.209> point<00:02:20.480> is<00:02:20.630> do<00:02:21.170> not

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
just can't think so the point is do not

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.070 
just can't think so the point is do not
forget<00:02:21.830> that<00:02:22.280> right<00:02:22.489> down<00:02:22.700> there<00:02:23.000> is<00:02:23.599> the<00:02:23.900> key

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
forget that right down there is the key

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.140 
forget that right down there is the key
to<00:02:24.830> doing<00:02:25.010> most<00:02:25.310> of<00:02:25.370> your<00:02:25.430> calculations<00:02:26.000> on

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
to doing most of your calculations on

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.870 
to doing most of your calculations on
the<00:02:26.270> front<00:02:26.510> so<00:02:27.170> again<00:02:28.010> we'll<00:02:28.190> probably<00:02:28.580> touch

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
the front so again we'll probably touch

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.449 
the front so again we'll probably touch
them<00:02:29.060> on<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.300> e6b<00:02:29.660> later<00:02:29.959> but<00:02:30.170> this<00:02:30.290> is<00:02:30.470> just<00:02:31.099> a

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
them on the e6b later but this is just a

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.000 
them on the e6b later but this is just a
little<00:02:31.730> tip<00:02:32.060> on<00:02:32.269> on<00:02:32.780> using<00:02:33.410> some<00:02:33.590> of<00:02:33.709> our<00:02:33.830> tools
