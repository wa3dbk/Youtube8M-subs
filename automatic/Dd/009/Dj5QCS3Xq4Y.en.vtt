Dyna torch superbee 4x4 table I just
wanted<00:00:08.730> to<00:00:08.820> touch<00:00:09.000> on<00:00:09.210> a<00:00:09.240> few<00:00:09.269> things<00:00:09.450> that<00:00:09.809> I

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
wanted to touch on a few things that I

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.690 
wanted to touch on a few things that I
found<00:00:10.110> over<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.559> last<00:00:10.710> few<00:00:10.950> days<00:00:11.160> -<00:00:11.490> in<00:00:11.550> the

for ground the table and the electronics
it<00:00:22.590> is<00:00:23.220> little<00:00:24.210> bit<00:00:24.330> complicated<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:25.350> will

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
it is little bit complicated you will

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.429 
it is little bit complicated you will
need<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:26.010> install<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.789> ground<00:00:27.150> rod<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.750> you'll

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
need to install a ground rod and you'll

need to install a ground rod and you'll
have<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.710> have<00:00:28.830> that<00:00:28.980> done<00:00:29.189> by<00:00:29.310> a<00:00:29.340> professional

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
have to have that done by a professional

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.790 
have to have that done by a professional
person<00:00:30.269> or<00:00:30.720> if<00:00:31.050> you're<00:00:31.230> very<00:00:31.410> comfortable

with it and you can also do it yourself
this<00:00:34.440> is<00:00:34.559> an<00:00:34.649> example<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:35.160> a<00:00:35.250> ground<00:00:35.489> rod<00:00:35.700> with

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
this is an example of a ground rod with

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.299 
this is an example of a ground rod with
the<00:00:36.719> electrode<00:00:37.350> connector<00:00:37.770> at<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.920> top<00:00:38.129> this

the electrode connector at the top this

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.020 
the electrode connector at the top this
is<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.489> 10<00:00:38.790> foot<00:00:39.000> one<00:00:39.540> we<00:00:39.690> had<00:00:39.840> installed<00:00:41.030> we

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
is a 10 foot one we had installed we

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.709 
is a 10 foot one we had installed we
also<00:00:42.210> threw<00:00:42.629> in<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:43.070> UPS<00:00:44.070> this<00:00:44.640> is<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:45.239> filter

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
also threw in a UPS this is to filter

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.990 
also threw in a UPS this is to filter
out<00:00:45.809> any<00:00:45.989> spikes<00:00:46.350> or<00:00:46.590> surges<00:00:47.160> or<00:00:47.399> any<00:00:47.760> noise

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
out any spikes or surges or any noise

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.260 
out any spikes or surges or any noise
coming<00:00:48.510> along<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.960> lines<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.620> sensitive

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
coming along the lines to the sensitive

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.139 
coming along the lines to the sensitive
electronics<00:00:51.270> I<00:00:52.460> have<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.610> control<00:00:53.940> software

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
electronics I have the control software

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.689 
electronics I have the control software
currently<00:00:54.660> installed<00:00:55.170> on<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.320> laptop<00:00:55.890> but<00:00:56.340> just

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
currently installed on a laptop but just

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.310 
currently installed on a laptop but just
to<00:00:56.820> note<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.030> will<00:00:57.420> need<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.660> screen<00:00:58.079> that's

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
to note you will need a screen that's

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.750 
to note you will need a screen that's
capable<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.949> displaying<00:00:59.960> 1080p<00:01:00.989> it's<00:01:01.710> 1920<00:01:02.609> by

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
capable of displaying 1080p it's 1920 by

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.179 
capable of displaying 1080p it's 1920 by
1080<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.480> believe<00:01:03.750> so<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.619> application

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
1080 I believe so the application

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.800 
1080 I believe so the application
displays<00:01:05.430> correctly

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
displays correctly

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.840 
displays correctly
so<00:01:08.680> this<00:01:08.860> is<00:01:09.010> the<00:01:09.100> first<00:01:09.280> time<00:01:09.490> we've<00:01:09.640> powered

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
so this is the first time we've powered

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.580 
so this is the first time we've powered
up<00:01:10.060> the<00:01:10.180> system<00:01:10.600> we've<00:01:10.750> got<00:01:10.780> the<00:01:11.020> control<00:01:11.380> box

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
up the system we've got the control box

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.039 
up the system we've got the control box
switched<00:01:11.890> on<00:01:12.159> and<00:01:12.369> the<00:01:12.729> laptop<00:01:13.360> is<00:01:13.540> driving

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:14.049 
switched on and the laptop is driving

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:16.890 
switched on and the laptop is driving
the<00:01:14.320> X<00:01:14.680> and<00:01:14.890> y-axis<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:16.420> server's<00:01:16.810> are

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
the X and y-axis the server's are

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.050 
the X and y-axis the server's are
extremely<00:01:17.470> quiet<00:01:17.650> the<00:01:18.549> sound<00:01:18.850> you<00:01:18.940> can

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
extremely quiet the sound you can

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.310 
extremely quiet the sound you can
probably<00:01:19.210> hear<00:01:19.390> in<00:01:19.479> the<00:01:19.570> background<00:01:19.780> is<00:01:20.140> more

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
probably hear in the background is more

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.930 
probably hear in the background is more
like<00:01:20.530> to<00:01:20.710> be<00:01:20.740> the<00:01:20.920> fan<00:01:21.190> that<00:01:21.400> we<00:01:21.520> have<00:01:21.670> in<00:01:21.850> the

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
like to be the fan that we have in the

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.219 
like to be the fan that we have in the
shop<00:01:22.150> they're<00:01:22.360> just<00:01:22.600> blowing<00:01:22.810> warm<00:01:23.110> air

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:23.229 
shop they're just blowing warm air

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.590 
shop they're just blowing warm air
around<00:01:23.440> but<00:01:24.190> it's<00:01:24.340> it's<00:01:24.940> very<00:01:24.970> very<00:01:25.180> quiet

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
around but it's it's very very quiet

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.070 
around but it's it's very very quiet
very<00:01:26.050> smooth<00:01:27.330> as<00:01:28.330> I<00:01:28.450> mentioned<00:01:28.899> in<00:01:28.990> the

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
very smooth as I mentioned in the

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.719 
very smooth as I mentioned in the
previous<00:01:29.290> video<00:01:29.710> we<00:01:29.740> plan<00:01:30.100> to<00:01:30.310> install<00:01:30.460> a

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:30.729 
previous video we plan to install a

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:33.749 
previous video we plan to install a
water<00:01:31.030> table<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:32.350> Dan<00:01:32.860> talk<00:01:33.100> frame<00:01:33.430> already

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
water table the Dan talk frame already

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:36.300 
water table the Dan talk frame already
has<00:01:33.909> those<00:01:34.149> tabs<00:01:34.450> already<00:01:35.350> fitted<00:01:35.830> so<00:01:36.009> you<00:01:36.130> can

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
has those tabs already fitted so you can

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.520 
has those tabs already fitted so you can
decide<00:01:36.700> the<00:01:36.850> table<00:01:37.149> in<00:01:37.240> the<00:01:37.899> slats<00:01:38.170> will<00:01:38.380> then

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
decide the table in the slats will then

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.859 
decide the table in the slats will then
go<00:01:38.740> inside<00:01:39.100> the<00:01:39.250> water<00:01:39.369> table<00:01:39.940> and<00:01:40.240> the<00:01:40.630> water

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:40.869 
go inside the water table and the water

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:42.810 
go inside the water table and the water
should<00:01:41.170> travel<00:01:41.590> up<00:01:41.740> about<00:01:42.039> halfway<00:01:42.310> of<00:01:42.700> the

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
should travel up about halfway of the

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.120 
should travel up about halfway of the
slat<00:01:43.060> so<00:01:43.330> I'm<00:01:43.810> kind<00:01:44.050> of<00:01:44.110> guessing<00:01:44.320> but<00:01:44.950> I'll

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
slat so I'm kind of guessing but I'll

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.639 
slat so I'm kind of guessing but I'll
see<00:01:45.550> as<00:01:45.700> we<00:01:45.880> as<00:01:46.179> we<00:01:46.420> go<00:01:46.450> along<00:01:46.659> I<00:01:46.840> saw<00:01:47.170> that<00:01:47.380> and

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
see as we as we go along I saw that and

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:50.070 
see as we as we go along I saw that and
again<00:01:47.979> I'll<00:01:48.159> do<00:01:48.490> a<00:01:48.520> video<00:01:48.789> detail<00:01:49.539> how<00:01:49.810> we<00:01:49.840> go

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
again I'll do a video detail how we go

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.779 
again I'll do a video detail how we go
about<00:01:50.110> finishing<00:01:50.890> that<00:01:50.920> off<00:01:53.220> this<00:01:54.220> is<00:01:54.429> a<00:01:54.460> torch

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 
about finishing that off this is a torch

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:57.180 
about finishing that off this is a torch
height<00:01:55.060> control<00:01:55.509> this<00:01:56.200> is<00:01:56.380> a<00:01:56.409> servo<00:01:56.740> driven

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
height control this is a servo driven

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:58.980 
height control this is a servo driven
motor<00:01:57.429> that<00:01:57.759> will<00:01:57.909> control<00:01:58.330> the<00:01:58.509> height<00:01:58.750> of

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
motor that will control the height of

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.899 
motor that will control the height of
the<00:01:59.319> torch<00:01:59.590> in<00:01:59.800> relation<00:02:00.159> to<00:02:00.190> the<00:02:00.399> work<00:02:00.610> during

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
the torch in relation to the work during

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.200 
the torch in relation to the work during
the<00:02:01.060> cutting<00:02:01.300> process<00:02:01.420> I<00:02:02.610> just<00:02:03.610> want<00:02:03.940> to<00:02:04.030> show

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
the cutting process I just want to show

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.590 
the cutting process I just want to show
you<00:02:04.270> the<00:02:04.569> the<00:02:05.020> breakaway<00:02:05.500> torch<00:02:06.240> this<00:02:07.240> is<00:02:07.420> in

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
you the the breakaway torch this is in

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.830 
you the the breakaway torch this is in
case<00:02:07.810> of<00:02:07.890> collisions<00:02:08.890> you<00:02:09.220> can<00:02:10.030> see<00:02:10.209> the<00:02:10.390> torch

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
case of collisions you can see the torch

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.810 
case of collisions you can see the torch
just<00:02:11.170> moves<00:02:11.440> a<00:02:11.620> pattern<00:02:11.950> all<00:02:12.250> the<00:02:12.310> way<00:02:12.489> there

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
just moves a pattern all the way there

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.420 
just moves a pattern all the way there
on<00:02:13.030> the<00:02:13.410> backside<00:02:14.410> of<00:02:14.440> this<00:02:14.650> is<00:02:14.920> five

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430
