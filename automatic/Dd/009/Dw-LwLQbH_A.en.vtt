Manny<00:02:03.990> Pacquiao<00:02:04.470> with<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.740> good<00:02:05.070> right<00:02:05.370> hand<00:02:05.670> I

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.060 
Manny Pacquiao with a good right hand I
think<00:02:06.480> in<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.630> fourth<00:02:06.960> or<00:02:07.200> fifth<00:02:07.230> round<00:02:07.800> and

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:08.070 
think in the fourth or fifth round and

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:09.290 
think in the fourth or fifth round and
that<00:02:08.550> changed

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
that changed

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.400 
that changed
Manny's<00:02:11.090> attitude<00:02:12.090> altogether<00:02:12.570> about<00:02:12.930> moving

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
Manny's attitude altogether about moving

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.350 
Manny's attitude altogether about moving
in<00:02:13.590> because

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
in because

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.360 
in because
Alanya<00:02:15.420> he<00:02:15.630> may<00:02:15.780> get<00:02:15.990> caught<00:02:16.260> in<00:02:16.440> another<00:02:16.590> hard

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
Alanya he may get caught in another hard

Alanya he may get caught in another hard
right<00:02:17.430> and<00:02:17.910> that<00:02:18.030> may<00:02:18.240> be<00:02:18.690> curtains<00:02:19.500> for<00:02:19.770> him

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
right and that may be curtains for him

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:27.220 
right and that may be curtains for him
so<00:02:20.340> it<00:02:20.820> changed<00:02:21.300> his<00:02:21.450> strategy<00:02:21.980> offensively

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.690
