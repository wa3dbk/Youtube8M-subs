00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
the first 50 wall and that's when it

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.610 
the first 50 wall and that's when it

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
record or anything like that we all knew

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.449 
record or anything like that we all knew
that<00:03:54.200> it<00:03:54.320> was<00:03:54.410> in<00:03:54.500> the<00:03:54.590> back<00:03:54.709> of<00:03:54.860> our<00:03:54.920> minds<00:03:55.160> but

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
that it was in the back of our minds but

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.850 
that it was in the back of our minds but
it<00:03:55.580> wasn't<00:03:55.880> like<00:03:56.030> a<00:03:56.270> set<00:03:57.020> goal<00:03:57.290> that<00:03:57.500> we<00:03:57.620> had
