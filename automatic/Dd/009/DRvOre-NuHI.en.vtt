00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
being a triceps I have real good

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.330 
being a triceps I have real good
generous<00:02:18.750> with<00:02:18.900> triceps<00:02:19.440> it<00:02:19.740> go<00:02:19.890> really<00:02:20.070> easy

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
generous with triceps it go really easy

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.530 
generous with triceps it go really easy
so<00:02:21.240> I'm<00:02:21.330> gonna<00:02:21.450> really<00:02:21.690> work<00:02:21.870> those<00:02:22.080> out<00:02:22.290> and

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
so I'm gonna really work those out and

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:25.970 
so I'm gonna really work those out and
my<00:02:24.540> Audrey<00:02:24.900> now<00:02:25.080> they<00:02:25.500> should<00:02:25.680> be<00:02:25.710> about

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
my Audrey now they should be about

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.540 
my Audrey now they should be about
sixteen<00:02:27.410> flexed<00:02:29.180> it<00:02:30.180> should<00:02:30.330> be<00:02:30.420> about<00:02:30.570> 16

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
sixteen flexed it should be about 16

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:34.880 
sixteen flexed it should be about 16
let's<00:02:32.550> just<00:02:32.790> wait<00:02:32.970> a<00:02:33.030> measurement<00:02:33.770> that's<00:02:34.770> a

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
let's just wait a measurement that's a

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.350 
let's just wait a measurement that's a
good<00:02:35.070> measure<00:02:35.660> but<00:02:36.660> it<00:02:36.780> says<00:02:36.960> 16<00:02:38.300> when<00:02:39.300> you

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
good measure but it says 16 when you

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.730 
good measure but it says 16 when you
guys<00:02:39.510> see<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:40.730> 16<00:02:41.730> homers<00:02:41.910> and<00:02:42.150> a<00:02:42.210> half<00:02:42.740> come

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
guys see the 16 homers and a half come

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.160 
guys see the 16 homers and a half come
on<00:02:43.830> unless<00:02:44.010> a<00:02:44.070> good<00:02:44.310> measurement<00:02:44.640> but<00:02:45.170> I'm

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
on unless a good measurement but I'm

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.390 
on unless a good measurement but I'm
going<00:02:46.440> to<00:02:46.500> measure<00:02:46.590> it<00:02:46.740> like<00:02:46.860> that

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
going to measure it like that

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.760 
going to measure it like that
and<00:02:47.790> make<00:02:48.060> sure<00:02:48.270> they're<00:02:48.930> a<00:02:48.960> little<00:02:49.200> too<00:02:49.470> fast

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
and make sure they're a little too fast

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.140 
and make sure they're a little too fast
because<00:02:50.100> that<00:02:50.250> could<00:02:50.490> be<00:02:50.640> just<00:02:50.820> a<00:02:50.910> layer<00:02:51.120> of

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
because that could be just a layer of

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.040 
because that could be just a layer of
fat<00:02:51.540> so<00:02:52.260> would<00:02:52.440> be<00:02:52.530> measuring<00:02:53.100> my<00:02:53.190> waist<00:02:54.050> 118

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
fat so would be measuring my waist 118

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.170 
fat so would be measuring my waist 118
fat<00:02:55.290> my<00:02:55.470> waist<00:02:55.740> it's<00:02:55.980> real<00:02:56.190> big<00:02:56.430> I<00:02:56.550> was<00:02:56.670> a<00:02:56.700> size

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
fat my waist it's real big I was a size

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.490 
fat my waist it's real big I was a size
34<00:02:57.510> in<00:02:57.840> January<00:02:58.290> so<00:02:58.730> right<00:02:59.730> now<00:03:00.200> I'm<00:03:01.200> going<00:03:01.410> to

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
34 in January so right now I'm going to

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.910 
34 in January so right now I'm going to
say<00:03:01.620> 20<00:03:02.570> and<00:03:03.570> as<00:03:03.840> well<00:03:04.020> as<00:03:04.110> I'm<00:03:04.200> going<00:03:04.410> to<00:03:04.500> 29

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
say 20 and as well as I'm going to 29

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.470 
say 20 and as well as I'm going to 29
and<00:03:05.160> he's<00:03:05.310> a<00:03:05.340> 95

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
and he's a 95

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.360 
and he's a 95
absolutely<00:03:07.170> I'm<00:03:07.290> a<00:03:07.320> calculated<00:03:08.040> I'm<00:03:08.190> not<00:03:08.340> a

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
absolutely I'm a calculated I'm not a

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.970 
absolutely I'm a calculated I'm not a
look<00:03:08.550> at<00:03:08.670> the<00:03:08.760> scale<00:03:09.030> because<00:03:09.810> if<00:03:10.709> I<00:03:10.770> look<00:03:10.860> at

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
look at the scale because if I look at

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.890 
look at the scale because if I look at
the<00:03:11.070> scale<00:03:11.280> right<00:03:11.640> now<00:03:11.760> over<00:03:11.970> 50<00:03:12.330> I'm<00:03:12.510> starting

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
the scale right now over 50 I'm starting

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.260 
the scale right now over 50 I'm starting
a<00:03:12.959> DL<00:03:13.260> out<00:03:13.410> of<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.590> carbs<00:03:13.950> and<00:03:14.850> look<00:03:15.060> at<00:03:15.180> this

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
a DL out of the carbs and look at this

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.020 
a DL out of the carbs and look at this
at<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.600> scale<00:03:15.870> when<00:03:16.020> it<00:03:16.110> says<00:03:16.260> 155<00:03:16.880> that<00:03:17.880> could

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
at the scale when it says 155 that could

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.340 
at the scale when it says 155 that could
be<00:03:18.120> just<00:03:18.300> like<00:03:18.570> each<00:03:18.750> other<00:03:18.930> because<00:03:19.290> I

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
be just like each other because I

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:20.810 
be just like each other because I
haven't<00:03:19.530> any<00:03:19.739> quarter<00:03:20.220> that<00:03:20.340> in<00:03:20.430> limited

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
haven't any quarter that in limited

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.880 
haven't any quarter that in limited
carbs<00:03:21.209> but<00:03:21.840> I<00:03:21.900> was<00:03:22.050> cutting<00:03:22.290> and<00:03:22.530> now<00:03:22.800> I'm

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
carbs but I was cutting and now I'm

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.550 
carbs but I was cutting and now I'm
going<00:03:23.040> to<00:03:23.100> start<00:03:23.310> eating<00:03:23.430> more<00:03:23.730> carbs<00:03:24.560> so

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
going to start eating more carbs so

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.540 
going to start eating more carbs so
that's<00:03:25.800> the

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
that's the

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.490 
that's the
is<00:03:26.910> that<00:03:27.060> be<00:03:27.180> a<00:03:27.209> little<00:03:27.330> complicated<00:03:27.690> that's

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
is that be a little complicated that's

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.720 
is that be a little complicated that's
the<00:03:28.650> way<00:03:28.770> I<00:03:28.800> would<00:03:28.950> track<00:03:29.190> it<00:03:29.400> and<00:03:29.580> we're

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
the way I would track it and we're

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.729 
the way I would track it and we're
trending<00:03:29.910> with<00:03:30.150> this<00:03:30.360> as<00:03:31.080> long<00:03:31.290> as<00:03:31.320> my<00:03:31.530> waist

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
trending with this as long as my waist

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.640 
trending with this as long as my waist
doesn't<00:03:32.130> go<00:03:32.220> 29<00:03:32.760> that<00:03:33.570> means<00:03:33.750> up<00:03:33.930> I'm<00:03:34.440> getting

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
doesn't go 29 that means up I'm getting

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.979 
doesn't go 29 that means up I'm getting
stronger<00:03:35.070> and<00:03:35.370> my<00:03:36.150> arms<00:03:36.420> are<00:03:36.510> getting<00:03:36.570> bigger

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
stronger and my arms are getting bigger

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.309 
stronger and my arms are getting bigger
that<00:03:37.890> means<00:03:38.070> influence<00:03:38.400> of<00:03:38.519> mustard<00:03:38.880> and

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
that means influence of mustard and

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.770 
that means influence of mustard and

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
as a little needle so much weight fast

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.860 
as a little needle so much weight fast
like<00:03:43.170> 10<00:03:43.590> pounds<00:03:43.799> in<00:03:44.040> a<00:03:44.099> month<00:03:44.129> or<00:03:44.609> 5<00:03:45.420> pounds<00:03:45.659> in
