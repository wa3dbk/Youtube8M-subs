to take the sleeves off and to do that

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.439 
to take the sleeves off and to do that
first<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.420> switch<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.110> dress<00:00:49.320> inside<00:00:49.559> out<00:00:49.980> and

first I switch the dress inside out and

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:52.790 
first I switch the dress inside out and
on<00:00:51.449> this<00:00:51.660> dress<00:00:51.899> because<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.350> was<00:00:52.500> made<00:00:52.649> on<00:00:52.680> a

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
on this dress because it was made on a

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.830 
on this dress because it was made on a
machine<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.430> edges<00:00:53.760> scenes<00:00:54.270> are<00:00:54.449> surged

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
machine the edges scenes are surged

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.750 
machine the edges scenes are surged
together<00:00:55.350> instead<00:00:55.770> of<00:00:55.829> hand<00:00:56.219> stitched<00:00:56.520> or

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
together instead of hand stitched or

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.029 
together instead of hand stitched or
seam<00:00:57.059> line<00:00:57.270> stitched<00:00:57.600> so<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.410> take<00:00:58.859> out

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
seam line stitched so to take out

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.069 
seam line stitched so to take out
serging<00:00:59.699> instead<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.149> using<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.570> seam<00:01:00.870> ripper

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
serging instead of using a seam ripper

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.779 
serging instead of using a seam ripper
what<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:01.410> do<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.949> stuff<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.489> sleeve<00:01:02.760> back

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
what I do is stuff the sleeve back

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.149 
what I do is stuff the sleeve back
inside<00:01:03.570> and<00:01:03.870> there's<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.409> search<00:01:04.650> edge<00:01:04.979> you

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
inside and there's the search edge you

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.890 
inside and there's the search edge you
can<00:01:05.339> see<00:01:05.610> it's<00:01:05.820> kind<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.299> looks<00:01:06.360> really

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
can see it's kind of it looks really

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.390 
can see it's kind of it looks really
really<00:01:06.930> finished<00:01:07.590> usually<00:01:07.950> for<00:01:08.130> still<00:01:08.280> on

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
really finished usually for still on

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.429 
really finished usually for still on
machine<00:01:08.820> so<00:01:09.540> just<00:01:09.720> take<00:01:09.869> your<00:01:10.049> scissors<00:01:10.229> and

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
machine so just take your scissors and

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.160 
machine so just take your scissors and
cut<00:01:10.710> just<00:01:10.950> right<00:01:11.490> into<00:01:12.270> where<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.900> the

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
cut just right into where the the

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.620 
cut just right into where the the
stitching<00:01:13.650> on<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:14.040> two<00:01:14.280> edges<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.420> dress

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
stitching on the two edges of the dress

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.510 
stitching on the two edges of the dress
and<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.869> sleeve<00:01:16.110> are<00:01:16.350> put<00:01:16.500> together<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:17.100> then

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
and the sleeve are put together and then

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.800 
and the sleeve are put together and then
you're<00:01:17.610> just<00:01:17.670> going<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.939> cut<00:01:18.180> that<00:01:18.420> seam<00:01:18.780> right

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
you're just going to cut that seam right

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.690 
you're just going to cut that seam right
off<00:01:19.320> just<00:01:19.619> like<00:01:19.770> this<00:01:19.979> all<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.460> way<00:01:20.580> around

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
off just like this all the way around

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.910 
off just like this all the way around
when<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:21.570> do<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:22.110> will<00:01:22.290> separate<00:01:22.740> the

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
when you do that that will separate the

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.890 
when you do that that will separate the
sleeves<00:01:23.189> from<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.520> dress<00:01:23.759> next<00:01:24.630> put<00:01:24.810> the

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
sleeves from the dress next put the

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.660 
sleeves from the dress next put the
dress<00:01:25.140> on<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.650> because<00:01:25.890> this<00:01:25.979> was<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.189> larger

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
dress on and because this was a larger

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.760 
dress on and because this was a larger
sized<00:01:26.880> dress<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.420> needed<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.930> pin<00:01:28.290> up<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.560> arm

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
sized dress I needed to pin up the arm

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.620 
sized dress I needed to pin up the arm
holes<00:01:29.130> so<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:29.970> arm<00:01:30.150> holes<00:01:30.360> weren't

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
holes so that the arm holes weren't

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.899 
holes so that the arm holes weren't
really<00:01:30.930> really<00:01:31.200> big<00:01:31.380> on<00:01:31.560> me<00:01:31.740> so<00:01:32.280> once<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.640> pinned

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
really really big on me so once I pinned

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.850 
really really big on me so once I pinned
them<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:33.240> just<00:01:33.270> sewed<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.720> seam<00:01:34.170> straight<00:01:34.619> down

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
them I just sewed a seam straight down

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.920 
them I just sewed a seam straight down
from<00:01:35.100> where<00:01:35.220> that<00:01:35.250> pin<00:01:35.640> was<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.509> actually

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
from where that pin was and I actually
