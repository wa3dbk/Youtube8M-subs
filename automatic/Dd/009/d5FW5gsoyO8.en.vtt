can maximize power by automating a great

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.060 
can maximize power by automating a great
way<00:00:55.090> to<00:00:55.149> save<00:00:55.420> power<00:00:55.660> is<00:00:55.960> to<00:00:56.200> shut<00:00:56.469> off<00:00:56.710> things

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
way to save power is to shut off things

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:58.830 
way to save power is to shut off things
that<00:00:57.250> aren't<00:00:57.489> being<00:00:57.610> used<00:00:57.879> like<00:00:58.030> Bluetooth<00:00:58.629> or

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
that aren't being used like Bluetooth or

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.650 
that aren't being used like Bluetooth or
Wi-Fi<00:00:59.219> but<00:01:00.219> many<00:01:00.430> of<00:01:00.610> us<00:01:00.730> would<00:01:00.879> forget<00:01:01.270> to<00:01:01.510> do

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
Wi-Fi but many of us would forget to do

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.060 
Wi-Fi but many of us would forget to do
that<00:01:01.770> so<00:01:02.770> with<00:01:02.950> tasker<00:01:03.610> you<00:01:04.149> can<00:01:04.360> configure

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
that so with tasker you can configure

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.550 
that so with tasker you can configure
profiles<00:01:06.070> that<00:01:06.600> will<00:01:07.600> automatically<00:01:08.380> do

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
profiles that will automatically do

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.830 
profiles that will automatically do
things<00:01:08.860> for<00:01:09.220> you<00:01:09.430> based<00:01:09.700> on<00:01:09.910> certain<00:01:10.180> actions

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
things for you based on certain actions

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.490 
things for you based on certain actions
so<00:01:11.320> just<00:01:11.649> as<00:01:11.830> one<00:01:12.100> example<00:01:12.310> I<00:01:13.020> have<00:01:14.020> one<00:01:14.229> called

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
so just as one example I have one called

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.160 
so just as one example I have one called

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
face down now what happens is when i

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.630 
face down now what happens is when i

GPS it dims the screen to its minimum so
all<00:01:35.890> these<00:01:36.340> things<00:01:36.399> immediately<00:01:37.300> save<00:01:38.110> power

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
all these things immediately save power

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.980 
all these things immediately save power
and<00:01:38.920> they<00:01:39.340> save<00:01:39.610> power<00:01:39.970> the<00:01:40.179> whole<00:01:40.360> time<00:01:40.720> my

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
and they save power the whole time my

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.260 
and they save power the whole time my
phone<00:01:41.229> is<00:01:41.530> face<00:01:41.770> down<00:01:41.800> so<00:01:42.700> if<00:01:42.819> I'm<00:01:43.000> just
