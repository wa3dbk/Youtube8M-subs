00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.690 
already thought it would be smart to it
as<00:05:37.400> you<00:05:37.580> see<00:05:37.760> LeBron<00:05:38.120> stats<00:05:38.750> right<00:05:38.990> there<00:05:39.460> 27<00:05:40.460> 4

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:40.700 
as you see LeBron stats right there 27 4

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.150 
as you see LeBron stats right there 27 4
and<00:05:40.820> 5<00:05:41.000> I<00:05:41.540> actually<00:05:42.020> think<00:05:42.290> they<00:05:42.470> yank<00:05:42.740> LeBron

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160 
and 5 I actually think they yank LeBron

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.350 
and 5 I actually think they yank LeBron
they<00:05:43.280> didn't<00:05:43.520> play<00:05:43.700> him<00:05:43.820> as<00:05:43.940> much<00:05:44.090> as<00:05:44.240> they

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
they didn't play him as much as they

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.240 
they didn't play him as much as they
really<00:05:44.630> could<00:05:44.840> have<00:05:44.870> you<00:05:45.680> know<00:05:45.800> having<00:05:46.100> that

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.250 
really could have you know having that

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.930 
really could have you know having that
victory<00:05:46.610> sealed<00:05:46.970> but<00:05:48.280> Bynum<00:05:49.280> needs<00:05:49.670> to<00:05:49.790> get

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940 
victory sealed but Bynum needs to get

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.360 
victory sealed but Bynum needs to get
more<00:05:50.090> rebound<00:05:50.620> that's<00:05:51.620> one<00:05:51.890> thing<00:05:52.100> when

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:52.370 
more rebound that's one thing when

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.160 
more rebound that's one thing when
glaring<00:05:52.790> think<00:05:53.030> seven<00:05:53.420> rebounds<00:05:53.810> isn't<00:05:54.050> going

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:54.170 
glaring think seven rebounds isn't going

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:55.570 
glaring think seven rebounds isn't going
to<00:05:54.260> cut<00:05:54.410> it<00:05:54.530> for<00:05:54.650> bynum<00:05:54.830> I'm<00:05:55.040> giving<00:05:55.340> him<00:05:55.400> the

to cut it for bynum I'm giving him the

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.340 
to cut it for bynum I'm giving him the
minute<00:05:55.880> so<00:05:56.030> I'm<00:05:56.090> letting<00:05:56.360> him<00:05:56.420> play<00:05:56.570> tired<00:05:56.960> and

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:57.350 
minute so I'm letting him play tired and

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.170 
minute so I'm letting him play tired and
you<00:05:58.100> know<00:05:58.190> I<00:05:58.220> expect<00:05:58.640> a<00:05:58.700> little<00:05:58.790> bit<00:05:59.060> more

00:05:59.170 --> 00:05:59.180

rebounds<00:05:59.630> all<00:05:59.780> the<00:05:59.870> Depot<00:06:00.140> had<00:06:00.290> a<00:06:00.320> really

tough<00:06:00.590> start<00:06:01.070> I<00:06:01.220> think<00:06:01.370> he<00:06:01.430> started<00:06:01.730> like<00:06:01.850> 0

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:01.970

tough start I think he started like 0
for<00:06:02.270> 8<00:06:02.450> but<00:06:03.110> he<00:06:03.350> rounded<00:06:03.680> it<00:06:03.950> out<00:06:04.130> ended<00:06:04.430> up<00:06:04.670> 8

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:04.850 
for 8 but he rounded it out ended up 8

420<00:06:05.180> he<00:06:05.840> actually<00:06:05.990> came<00:06:06.260> through<00:06:06.620> really

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:06.950 
420 he actually came through really

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.920 
420 he actually came through really
