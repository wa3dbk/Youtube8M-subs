00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:20.560
 hello my people i am christ and we 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:22.720
 play today co2 so what else 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.270
 the game just has to be gambled 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.509
 and that's why there's the game today 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:31.840
 I also want to have a long time 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:35.100
 back again because I had just real 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:41.070
 Whole time between stress in school 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:45.600
 and just too small a city 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:49.690
 to comment here 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.690
 Likewise , I have a few edited 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.690
 Tricks uploaded and have hardly noticed 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.730
 more really cool 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:02.199
 there would be a certain start or 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:05.710
 so if that continued like that was a knock 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:07.390
 with you and yes, I'm looking forward to everyone 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.420
 Be sure about every rating 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.950
 I got is really great 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.700
 of you that you finally have 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.750
 noticed that you also rate videos 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.550
 can 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:23.470
 and first come to the gameplay and that 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:27.310
 the gameplay is not playing by me 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:30.310
 but from the dear mo so x1 medway 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.050
 if I know who is not easy times 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.979
 for me the best player on the ps2 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:38.680
 bam bam and although he is now under the 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:42.550
 video linked and here on the top right too 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:45.340
 Still , if your team is on the channel 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.500
 bolt then really goes for him for that 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:52.899
 is really cool there are right 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:55.149
 awesome gameplay 100 plus just that 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:57.970
 you can watch your eyes burn 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:00.550
 that's how you can be on his two angels 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:04.560
 the whole 100 plus missing then look 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.560
 So 90 + 80 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.750
 and I guess that just shocks 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.820
 all the time, yes, we also see 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:17.470
 here only the second round of one 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:20.860
 reign on raid which is why first route 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.709
 He died five times second round 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.720
 not at all and I have on his bunch 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.190
 now shown only the second round because 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.140
 he just makes her the most chris 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.690
 and here you can see that his 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.970
 game intelligence is very high 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:37.049
 Then we'll just come to 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.530
 next topic what I have and indeed 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:39.630
 game intelligence I have 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.680
 addressed 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.260
 he really has a high one 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.900
 game intelligence 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.320
 he knows about a second earlier what he knows 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.320
 to do 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:55.329
 At least that's what he believes 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:57.130
 so sometimes I know that with me 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:58.150
 I have days there and I just know that there 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.150
 comes an opponent 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.099
 I just know it out of feeling 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.310
 and some days I tell myself 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:08.530
 shit i just have bad luck why is coming 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.790
 right there out of this window where right now 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.079
 I went by 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:18.220
 that's exactly where somebody got out that 's something 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:19.780
 is just sick that's easy 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.450
 actually more luck and bad luck though 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:26.079
 play to game intelligence that act 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.790
 now for that, because if you are intelligent 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:30.069
 is throwing one's first stage that 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.500
 house above what we here so often 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:36.250
 Really see the whole used 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.980
 time very much what I find so cool that 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.930
 I also got used to it now c4 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.540
 just spend all the time in front of the corners too 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.870
 Throw because that really gets you 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.750
 More campers are dead and everyone is in the area 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.609
 I do not know what will be ten meters away 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.310
 asked and you just know the 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:56.950
 sure that someone is here for 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:04.120
 example, the c4 is likely to die then 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:07.209
 unfortunately, but nothing makes in any case 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:12.010
 go on game intelligence now 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:13.239
 i said yes i said that 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.310
 it was actually I would say everything 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:16.120
 I did not want to see anything anymore 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.549
 continue 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:24.110
 In any case, I may well I 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:26.150
 I want to say that we have the channel 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.460
 what i mentioned i have many 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:31.580
 asked when we finally got this channel 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:34.300
 open up and that 's it decides the 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.300
 channels germany 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:39.650
 it's already on video but that's it 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:40.340
 not yet solved you yet 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.800
 available 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.050
 because now we have first to top 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:49.210
 of the video my god what left grad 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:52.520
 from pop to the beginning of the video we have 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:54.560
 what a project is planned and that lasts 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:59.479
 we had the perfect everything 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:00.740
 and yes you can already 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:03.529
 go on it should be now right above 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:05.599
 be left and that's it 

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:07.279
 then again here with the video 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:07.729
 a god five minutes are so fast 

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:11.689
 rum 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:16.330
 I can not believe it I would have to 

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:21.830
 Now watch again pulled that out of the 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:27.469
 128 to five to you mo that I do 

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:30.129
 got gameplay and skin in and out 

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:30.129
 Until next time
