00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:36.479 
over top I kept doing latex all the way
around<00:02:34.269> the<00:02:34.480> edges<00:02:34.629> and<00:02:35.230> then<00:02:35.890> did<00:02:36.099> a<00:02:36.129> full

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:36.489 
around the edges and then did a full

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.819 
around the edges and then did a full
application<00:02:37.420> of<00:02:37.659> makeup<00:02:37.959> all<00:02:38.109> over<00:02:38.349> his<00:02:38.530> face

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 
application of makeup all over his face

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:40.619

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:40.629 
so it's basically held together with

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:43.679 
so it's basically held together with
latex<00:02:41.379> and<00:02:41.590> plastic<00:02:42.370> and<00:02:42.579> balloons<00:02:42.909> like<00:02:43.359> it
