00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.159 
it's Airy it's prayerful the old way the
church<00:03:18.940> was<00:03:19.209> I<00:03:19.299> would<00:03:19.419> describe<00:03:19.750> this<00:03:19.900> kind<00:03:20.109> of

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:20.169 
church was I would describe this kind of

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:21.780 
church was I would describe this kind of
that<00:03:20.260> living<00:03:20.530> room<00:03:20.680> architecture<00:03:21.280> and<00:03:21.459> it

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
that living room architecture and it

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.400 
that living room architecture and it
lent<00:03:22.000> itself<00:03:22.120> to<00:03:22.540> that<00:03:22.569> that<00:03:22.900> kind<00:03:23.139> of<00:03:23.200> noise

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
lent itself to that that kind of noise

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.610 
lent itself to that that kind of noise
and<00:03:23.980> kind<00:03:24.819> of<00:03:24.910> lack<00:03:25.450> of<00:03:25.480> a<00:03:25.720> spiritual<00:03:26.380> sense

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
and kind of lack of a spiritual sense

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.229 
and kind of lack of a spiritual sense
and<00:03:26.799> lack<00:03:26.919> of<00:03:26.950> reflective<00:03:27.549> sense<00:03:27.760> I<00:03:27.940> think<00:03:27.970> it

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
and lack of reflective sense I think it

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:29.789 
and lack of reflective sense I think it
will<00:03:28.359> bring<00:03:28.540> more<00:03:28.810> people<00:03:29.049> into<00:03:29.349> the<00:03:29.560> church

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
first as a matter of curiosity but then
