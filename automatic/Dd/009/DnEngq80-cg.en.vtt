00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
itself and it does a great job of a

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.440 
itself and it does a great job of a
company<00:00:35.219> in<00:00:35.280> choir<00:00:35.460> also<00:00:35.820> in<00:00:35.969> general

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
conferences but that's actually paid off

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.450

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
so much power and it's worked very well

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.040 
so much power and it's worked very well
in<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.489> Christmas<00:00:44.820> concerts<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.390> last<00:00:45.750> five

play this console was engineered to be

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.890 
play this console was engineered to be
very<00:01:11.280> similar<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.000> tabernacle<00:01:12.210> organ<00:01:12.810> so

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
very similar to the tabernacle organ so

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.260 
very similar to the tabernacle organ so
it<00:01:12.990> has<00:01:13.140> five<00:01:13.439> manual<00:01:14.220> keyboards<00:01:14.729> or<00:01:14.880> manuals

it has five manual keyboards or manuals

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.359 
it has five manual keyboards or manuals
as<00:01:15.390> we<00:01:15.509> call<00:01:15.689> them<00:01:15.840> one<00:01:16.409> pedal<00:01:16.740> keyboard<00:01:17.130> has

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
as we call them one pedal keyboard has

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.399 
as we call them one pedal keyboard has
the<00:01:17.520> same<00:01:17.729> number<00:01:18.000> of<00:01:18.060> notes<00:01:18.270> 61<00:01:18.840> notes<00:01:19.110> for

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
the same number of notes 61 notes for

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.499 
the same number of notes 61 notes for
each<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:19.650> these<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.070> 32<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:20.880> then<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.240> pedal

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
each of these and 32 and then the pedal

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.960 
each of these and 32 and then the pedal
board<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.560> layout<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:22.979> these<00:01:23.400> these<00:01:23.820> are

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
board and the layout of these these are

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.760 
board and the layout of these these are
called<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.240> stops<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.930> layout<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.500> stops

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
called the stops the layout of the stops

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.340 
called the stops the layout of the stops
is<00:01:26.070> very<00:01:26.250> similar<00:01:26.759> to<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.509> Tabernacle<00:01:28.080> organ

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
is very similar to the Tabernacle organ

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.929 
is very similar to the Tabernacle organ
so<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:28.590> means<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:28.979> when<00:01:29.100> we<00:01:29.130> take<00:01:29.729> when<00:01:29.909> we

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
so that means that when we take when we

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.429 
so that means that when we take when we
learn<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.180> piece<00:01:30.420> over<00:01:30.720> there<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.140> then<00:01:31.229> come

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
learn a piece over there and then come

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.020 
learn a piece over there and then come
over<00:01:31.470> here<00:01:31.920> it's<00:01:32.310> not<00:01:32.520> as<00:01:32.640> big<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:32.850> an

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
over here it's not as big of an

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.690 
over here it's not as big of an
adjustment<00:01:33.890> learning<00:01:34.890> on<00:01:35.040> this<00:01:35.130> in<00:01:35.340> terms<00:01:35.520> of

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
adjustment learning on this in terms of

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.399 
adjustment learning on this in terms of
where<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.000> play<00:01:36.240> but<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.659> organ<00:01:36.930> itself<00:01:37.259> is

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
where you play but the organ itself is

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.780 
where you play but the organ itself is
different<00:01:37.829> isn't<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.130> why<00:01:38.340> don't<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:38.579> tell<00:01:38.759> us

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
different isn't it why don't you tell us

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.130 
different isn't it why don't you tell us
a<00:01:38.909> little<00:01:38.939> bit<00:01:39.150> about<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.600> pipes<00:01:39.840> because

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
a little bit about the pipes because

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.080 
a little bit about the pipes because
they're<00:01:40.680> reminiscent<00:01:41.310> of<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.490> Tabernacle

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
they're reminiscent of the Tabernacle

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.429 
they're reminiscent of the Tabernacle
working<00:01:42.420> but<00:01:42.600> but<00:01:42.810> they're<00:01:42.930> much<00:01:43.079> different

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
working but but they're much different

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.440 
working but but they're much different
or<00:01:43.470> thing<00:01:43.740> yeah<00:01:44.369> they<00:01:44.549> are<00:01:44.700> this<00:01:44.939> this<00:01:45.180> organ

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
or thing yeah they are this this organ

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.330 
or thing yeah they are this this organ
has<00:01:45.600> seven<00:01:46.290> thousand<00:01:46.649> seven<00:01:46.829> hundred<00:01:47.070> and

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
has seven thousand seven hundred and

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.740 
has seven thousand seven hundred and
eight<00:01:47.430> individual<00:01:47.970> pipes<00:01:48.240> so<00:01:48.479> it's<00:01:48.600> about

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
eight individual pipes so it's about

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.569 
eight individual pipes so it's about
two-thirds<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.409> size<00:01:49.500> of<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:49.979> tabernacle

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
two-thirds the size of the tabernacle

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.389 
two-thirds the size of the tabernacle
organ<00:01:50.909> but<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.720> pipe<00:01:52.110> scales<00:01:52.649> that<00:01:53.009> means<00:01:53.220> the

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
organ but the pipe scales that means the

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.520 
organ but the pipe scales that means the
the<00:01:53.640> diameter<00:01:54.180> relative<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.869> height<00:01:55.079> is

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
the diameter relative to the height is

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.219 
the diameter relative to the height is
much<00:01:55.860> larger<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.729> it<00:01:56.909> has<00:01:57.060> higher<00:01:57.930> wind

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
much larger and it has higher wind

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.389 
much larger and it has higher wind
pressures<00:01:58.649> on<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.950> whole<00:01:59.130> than<00:01:59.310> the

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
pressures on the whole than the

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:00.980 
pressures on the whole than the
tabernacle<00:01:59.969> organ<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.329> that's<00:02:00.450> that's<00:02:00.780> so

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
tabernacle organ and that's that's so

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.240 
tabernacle organ and that's that's so
that<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.229> sound<00:02:01.500> can<00:02:01.740> get<00:02:01.860> out<00:02:01.979> into<00:02:02.159> this

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
that the sound can get out into this

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.429 
that the sound can get out into this
huge<00:02:02.310> room<00:02:02.969> which<00:02:03.149> is<00:02:03.270> about<00:02:03.420> about<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.229> size

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
huge room which is about about the size

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.059 
huge room which is about about the size
of<00:02:04.560> six<00:02:04.799> Tabernacles<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.759> also<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:07.110> pipes<00:02:07.350> on

they the organ really was designed to be
a<00:03:02.280> standalone<00:03:02.700> instrument<00:03:03.420> well<00:03:03.960> Rick<00:03:04.140> could

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
a standalone instrument well Rick could

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.110 
a standalone instrument well Rick could
you<00:03:04.440> demonstrate<00:03:04.680> just<00:03:05.100> play<00:03:05.520> a<00:03:05.550> few<00:03:05.670> notes

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
you demonstrate just play a few notes

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.790 
you demonstrate just play a few notes
and<00:03:06.390> some<00:03:06.510> of<00:03:06.600> the<00:03:06.660> registers<00:03:07.140> and<00:03:07.410> maybe<00:03:07.530> show

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
and some of the registers and maybe show

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.380 
and some of the registers and maybe show
us<00:03:07.830> how<00:03:08.100> the<00:03:08.160> pedals<00:03:08.490> work<00:03:08.670> and<00:03:08.910> then<00:03:09.300> we'd

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
us how the pedals work and then we'd

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:10.670 
us how the pedals work and then we'd
like<00:03:09.540> to<00:03:09.660> hear<00:03:09.780> a<00:03:09.840> little<00:03:09.900> bit<00:03:10.080> for<00:03:10.320> Christmas

to each of the individual keyboards so

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.590 
to each of the individual keyboards so
we<00:03:35.650> have<00:03:35.770> five<00:03:36.070> keyboards<00:03:36.700> here<00:03:36.910> and<00:03:37.060> a<00:03:37.300> sixth

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
we have five keyboards here and a sixth

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.660 
we have five keyboards here and a sixth
one<00:03:37.660> down<00:03:37.960> below<00:03:38.140> and<00:03:38.860> each<00:03:39.010> of<00:03:39.130> those<00:03:39.220> has<00:03:39.490> its

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
one down below and each of those has its

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.060 
one down below and each of those has its
own<00:03:39.820> organ<00:03:40.450> basically<00:03:41.020> that's<00:03:41.590> attached<00:03:41.920> to

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
own organ basically that's attached to

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:43.800 
own organ basically that's attached to
that<00:03:42.250> and<00:03:42.490> the<00:03:43.000> way<00:03:43.120> you<00:03:43.180> make<00:03:43.420> an<00:03:43.540> organ

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
that and the way you make an organ

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.080 
that and the way you make an organ
louder<00:03:43.990> is<00:03:44.290> you<00:03:44.410> basically<00:03:44.620> keep<00:03:45.010> adding<00:03:45.430> more

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
louder is you basically keep adding more

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.840 
louder is you basically keep adding more
and<00:03:46.270> more<00:03:46.560> stops

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:58.870 

until<00:03:52.510> you<00:03:52.570> get<00:03:52.720> a<00:03:52.750> pretty<00:03:53.680> big

or the broadcast so that we can make

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.020 
or the broadcast so that we can make

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 
about sixteen cycles per second and I

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.580 
about sixteen cycles per second and I
can<00:05:10.180> go<00:05:10.300> four<00:05:10.570> notes<00:05:10.750> lower<00:05:11.020> one<00:05:12.060> two<00:05:13.590> three
