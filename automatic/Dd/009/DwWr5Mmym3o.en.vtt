because its of

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.580 
because its of
I<00:00:51.220> think<00:00:52.220> there<00:00:52.310> are<00:00:52.340> a<00:00:52.430> lot<00:00:52.460> of<00:00:52.640> people<00:00:53.590> who

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
I think there are a lot of people who

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.160 
I think there are a lot of people who
get<00:00:54.740> into<00:00:54.800> the<00:00:55.130> industry

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
get into the industry

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.760 
get into the industry
really<00:00:56.860> happen<00:00:57.130> I<00:00:58.170> mean<00:00:59.170> it<00:00:59.320> sounds<00:00:59.620> very

00:00:59.760 --> 00:00:59.770 
really happen I mean it sounds very

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.619 
really happen I mean it sounds very
glamorous<00:01:00.010> and<00:01:00.430> in<00:01:00.520> history<00:01:00.640> cameras<00:01:01.239> we<00:01:01.420> live

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
glamorous and in history cameras we live

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:04.710 
glamorous and in history cameras we live
the<00:01:02.530> lives<00:01:02.739> of

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
the lives of

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:12.350 
the lives of
we<00:01:05.500> have<00:01:05.800> an<00:01:06.190> expendable<00:01:06.730> income

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:19.240 

so<00:01:13.440> we<00:01:14.440> can<00:01:14.860> go<00:01:15.010> to<00:01:15.070> plants<00:01:15.490> and<00:01:15.610> parts

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.050 

fancy<00:01:19.940> restaurants

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
fancy restaurants

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.289 
fancy restaurants
but<00:01:22.630> some<00:01:23.530> of<00:01:23.620> that<00:01:23.650> is<00:01:23.950> that<00:01:24.190> we<00:01:24.340> do

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:26.299 
but some of that is that we do

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:29.590 
but some of that is that we do
we<00:01:26.750> simply<00:01:26.990> sum<00:01:27.399> it's<00:01:28.399> all<00:01:28.520> about<00:01:28.700> silence<00:01:29.090> and

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
we simply sum it's all about silence and

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.910 
we simply sum it's all about silence and
I<00:01:29.750> think<00:01:29.960> a<00:01:30.020> lot<00:01:30.259> of<00:01:30.289> people<00:01:30.590> aren't<00:01:30.740> willing

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
I think a lot of people aren't willing

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.219 
I think a lot of people aren't willing
to<00:01:31.100> put<00:01:31.399> in<00:01:31.520> that<00:01:31.670> time<00:01:32.000> initiative<00:01:32.960> and<00:01:33.140> they

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
to put in that time initiative and they

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:47.580 
to put in that time initiative and they
don't

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.700 

many<00:01:48.369> process<00:01:48.759> was<00:01:48.970> a<00:01:49.570> lot<00:01:50.049> of<00:01:50.079> experiment

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710
