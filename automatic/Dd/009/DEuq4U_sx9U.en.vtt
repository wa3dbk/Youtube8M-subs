00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.120
 Speak there, youtube galera, we are here. 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.730
 for another video and today I'll be 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.970
 doing a quick boxing for you guys. 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:24.240
 lapel microphone that came to me and 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.480
 I bought that microphone on the ebay side 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.390
 And he came to me today. 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.339
 just come and let's go have a 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:39.229
 moto yes he saw that speaks the middle to the fight 

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:39.229
 and 11 or open that is what matters 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.539
 before for having support 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:01:19.469
 Here you have a microphone bag 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:22.560
 here open more let's hear from him that is 

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:25.170
 always little things 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.280
 so here's the car microphone here 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:32.969
 it's an input p2 like as 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:38.249
 any microphone headset here 

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:42.060
 microphone and said with the pine cone 

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:44.520
 It is here that a microphone is here with a 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.920
 business to put on gravatal shirt 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.799
 or anything you can can also 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.619
 put a crepe tape and a text without 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:56.280
 because there are three types of 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.409
 different from deer to the 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.420
 microphone 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.179
 This is more a lot of money here. 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.329
 here it is leaner 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:08.250
 are three different paths 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:11.190
 are good and will be fast enough just to 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.060
 Show you who arrived with this. 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.870
 all videos will be made 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.220
 with this microphone maybe I put a 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.920
 test for you 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.560
 maybe not for you to see the quality 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.349
 and comparing with the river microphone 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.530
 which is the headset that I have 

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:32.860
 currently it is at 7 am 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.989
 is it folks it pretty quickly 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.599
 do not forget to give that one there 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:40.660
 that favorite to give a 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:43.000
 agility in disclosure and that's it 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:46.239
 staff and silvio of today I hope 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.600
 have enjoyed your ball and then everyone 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:52.810
 all back as promised to test 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.660
 for you see here the difference between 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.989
 of the lapel microphone which is a 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:03:01.900
 boxing to see there for you and my old 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:04.959
 ancient is not because it's my network 7 and 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:08.170
 old microphone and record for you guys 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:11.019
 which is my microphone from my reiser 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:14.500
 which is an internal box channel and everything else 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:16.390
 let's not go into detail but beauty 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.030
 I'll probably be leaving a 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.940
 background gameplay I do not know 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:26.140
 leaving some smoke to you 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:28.959
 then follow the audio difference 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:32.319
 my laser microphone 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:36.579
 the lapel microphone that arrived today 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:40.269
 to me this is just a door talk and only one 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:43.870
 man rolls you guys notion of 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:46.569
 difference in quality of capture or 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.120
 Anything like that? 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:51.370
 repair the microphone height 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.859
 anything so upset correct 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.200
 Audacity is one thing that she 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:04:00.489
 make this microphone clear here 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:03.400
 has called the background and litchi so only 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:05.260
 I solve this is with the dowry without 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.359
 no problem 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:11.200
 So this one was just a little bit 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:14.049
 a laser for you to listen and listen 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:16.299
 now I'll get a piece with the 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:20.739
 lapel microphone 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:23.440
 left then if we are here with a 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.390
 blackberry and health lapel microphone 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.560
 You're just listening to the microphone. 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.570
 lapel 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:32.050
 so you should be noticing the 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:35.860
 difference in sound quality is not 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:39.100
 only the noises all that everything that 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:41.139
 I was never caught and something else I 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.889
 I wanted to point out that this microphone 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:47.830
 here he is much less upset like this 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:49.960
 closing almost imperceptibly but is 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.530
 always cool to leave this kind of call 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.139
 none 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.970
 one thing that I notice is that everyone 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:56.680
 the closed microphones 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:00.000
 I do not know if it's true, I could be talking. 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:03.400
 wrong person who has a headset 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.620
 something that makes video and realizes that 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.540
 there is no dialogue in the comments 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.840
 It will be nice to know if you have it or not. 

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:13.600
 has key but anyway 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:16.510
 I'm just recording here for you guys. 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:20.979
 see the quality even if you perceive 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:23.729
 the difference of a microphone from a 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:26.889
 microphone to another, you can see it here 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:29.650
 really is very different from microphone 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:34.150
 to the microphone I 'm using a 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:36.760
 pro lapel microphone I do not 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:39.370
 I'm using it dry it's with the 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:42.190
 Copinha because the hood does not leave 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.900
 burst the sound the sound can be fine 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.600
 high I have to give a scream 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:49.300
 very strong here to explore 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:52.900
 the sound with that hood that feels like 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:54.700
 If a filter is like a 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.070
 Let 's just say the sound 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:06:00.460
 looks more like a studio sound one 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:03.970
 sound of dubbing of films or some 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:06.400
 thing of that niche and personal beauty did not 

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:07.450
 forget to rate the video let the 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.690
 comments 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:14.650
 any doubt what you're going to leave the 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:16.979
 microphone link in the description if someone 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:20.289
 are you interested anything like this? 

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:21.310
 I'll leave it in the description, is that it? 

00:06:20.289 --> 00:06:22.870
 folks 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:24.130
 I hope you liked this video 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.900
 I hope it has been made clear 

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:28.450
 difference and I hope you have 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:31.690
 liked the quality of the new microphone 

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:36.659
 which will be recording for you 

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:36.659
 Personal beauty spoke up to the next video
