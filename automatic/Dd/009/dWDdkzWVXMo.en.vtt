00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:08.250
 at the beginning of April the motorola 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.550
 made available to the Brazilian market 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.590
 two new smartphone models razr 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.849
 of one and redemption of three 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.190
 the first one was analyzed 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.170
 recently by tech in the world and now 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.449
 it came the turn of the king of 3 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.420
 the intermediate smartphone model with 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.430
 affordable price within your proposal 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.090
 with a dual core processor of 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.420
 1.2 ghz chips the razr v3 still has 1 gb 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.910
 of ram 4 GB of storage space 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:37.860
 and 8 megapixel rear camera 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.340
 the average price of the product revolves around 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.110
 of 699 and 799 reais 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.260
 check out what we think about the performance of 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.260
 appliance 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.110
 the first impression we have to take 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.820
 razr v3 is that it is a 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.100
 resistant product 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.930
 the most rustic design traits with 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.030
 more rectangular lines and the 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.010
 Rear made in break finish 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.539
 highlighting these characteristics of 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.960
 so that the owner has full 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.150
 to handle the product using 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.460
 only 120 grams the model is also 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.659
 anatomically comfortable and has a 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.880
 firm footprint 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.400
 however, this does not exempt the product from 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.320
 possible points of students as fact 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.189
 the screws are exposed in the 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.799
 sides 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.570
 we were pleasantly surprised to notice 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.090
 in our tests that the device 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.560
 behaved in an exemplary manner not 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.509
 we have treatments or some 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.130
 behavior that could harm the 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.299
 application performance for the 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.549
 which is a great 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.140
 for the appliance located on the 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.009
 in this price range 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.570
 resolution of 800 by 480 pixels is 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.600
 low compared to smartphones 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.490
 more advanced but it does mean 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.920
 that the visual application games will be 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.619
 committed to protecting gorilla glass 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.140
 ensures more existential glass by following 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.840
 the same line of product design in light 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.030
 the day in open environments the reflections 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.770
 that affect the screen makes it difficult to 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.590
 vision but nothing that makes it unfeasible 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.630
 use credit 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.720
 in our tests we used the programs 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.849
 benchmark and candle in the act 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.140
 performance of razr v3 was shown 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:15.030
 efficient 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.490
 the mark of seven thousand four hundred and 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.340
 sixty-seven points a little less than 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.709
 that the galaxy s2 top of the line generation 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:27.060
 previous but above models such as 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:28.830
 optimus 2x fraser of a xperia and the already 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.840
 in the case of the fleece a smartphone 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.290
 motorola did much better than the 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:37.230
 competitors evaluated with resolution of 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.150
 8 megapixels razr v3 camera not 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.540
 presented no apparent problem in 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.920
 our tests within their limitations 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.750
 she behaved in a satisfactory manner 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.650
 both in environments with good lighting 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.989
 as in darker places 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.030
 the razr v3 battery is another item that 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.970
 certainly will not disappoint 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.950
 buyers with moderate use by simulating 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.900
 the daily life of a consumer with wifi 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.060
 connected and internet access 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.620
 times throughout the day beyond use 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.269
 of some applications 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.890
 battery life was 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.050
 enough to make the device 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:16.260
 endured all day without the need 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:18.630
 of a recharge the razr v3 model has 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.070
 closed battery and can not be opened 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.530
 on a screwdriver 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.720
 because of this both the micro sd card 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.160
 how much the two chips are placed in the 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.170
 from the side 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.329
 to access the inputs you need 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.670
 remove a small, fragile 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:35.519
 plastic that is attached to the appliance 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.680
 by a thin plastic line 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.579
 motorola figured that this could be 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.829
 a problem 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:42.750
 so much that together with the device she 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:44.670
 offers a kind of palette that 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.310
 allows you to open the 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.840
 side caps in practice few 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.209
 people are going to walk around with the palette 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.340
 removing the lid on the nail is not a good 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:56.630
 idea and in the end that part 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:59.250
 product tends not to last long 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:02.610
 images are captured in the extension 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.140
 3gp other than the mp4 standard used in 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.090
 most appliances 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.680
 this compression format ends 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.780
 resulting in an audio quality 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.130
 lower which generates more sound 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.329
 stuffy 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.329
 the other I was going 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:26.680
 certainly within your razr proposal 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.090
 v3 is one of the best buying options 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.800
 that the consumer can find in the 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:34.199
 market costing between 699 and 799 reais 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.729
 the device has the settings 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:38.680
 balanced and because of that can 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:41.680
 quietly run most of the 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.180
 existing applications in place thor 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.100
 we note some problems that may 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.500
 bother the consumer in the design of 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.509
 construction and in particular the 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.660
 shows the fragility of the 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:54.430
 entry for the card chip to the 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.020
 audio quality in videos as well 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.669
 could be better 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.740
 and if you like to download too much 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:02.289
 applications is already preparing to buy 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:04.800
 a micro SD card as the space 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:08.110
 storage is only 4 gb 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.090
 yet the razr v3 is shown as a 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.910
 of the options that results in the best 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:15.190
 cost effectiveness of the market by offering a 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:17.320
 quality product capable of withstanding 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:20.020
 with ease for at least a year and 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.970
 life without becoming obsolete and 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.110
 without charging an abusive price of your 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:25.720
 consumer 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:28.199
 complete analysis of the world and 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.199
