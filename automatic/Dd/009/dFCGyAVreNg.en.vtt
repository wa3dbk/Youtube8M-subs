00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
the video to describe our stage of the

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.999 
the video to describe our stage of the
process<00:00:03.210> in<00:00:03.750> restoring<00:00:04.290> this<00:00:04.440> bag<00:00:04.710> I've

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
process in restoring this bag I've

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.849 
process in restoring this bag I've
removed<00:00:05.339> the<00:00:05.700> color<00:00:06.540> that<00:00:06.750> was<00:00:06.870> applied<00:00:07.080> by<00:00:07.500> a

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
removed the color that was applied by a

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.780 
removed the color that was applied by a
copper<00:00:08.610> I<00:00:08.730> guess<00:00:09.000> it<00:00:09.210> was<00:00:09.300> a<00:00:09.330> oxide<00:00:10.080> blue<00:00:10.790> craft

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
copper I guess it was a oxide blue craft

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.240 
copper I guess it was a oxide blue craft
paint<00:00:12.090> that's<00:00:12.509> all<00:00:12.750> been<00:00:12.870> removed<00:00:13.230> I<00:00:13.530> went

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
paint that's all been removed I went

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.800 
paint that's all been removed I went
down<00:00:14.400> to<00:00:14.580> raw<00:00:15.379> leather<00:00:17.119> in<00:00:18.119> doing<00:00:18.510> that<00:00:18.630> which

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
down to raw leather in doing that which

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.599 
down to raw leather in doing that which
I<00:00:18.990> needed<00:00:19.260> to<00:00:19.320> do<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:19.619> also<00:00:19.770> remove<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.220> glaze

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
I needed to do and also remove the glaze

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.759 
I needed to do and also remove the glaze
that<00:00:20.640> was<00:00:21.270> there<00:00:21.539> which<00:00:21.779> was<00:00:21.810> old<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.470> needed

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
that was there which was old and needed

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.980 
that was there which was old and needed
to<00:00:22.800> be<00:00:22.980> replaced<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.910> after<00:00:24.510> that<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:24.900> I'll

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
to be replaced and after that and I'll

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.450 
to be replaced and after that and I'll
start<00:00:25.470> with<00:00:25.590> this<00:00:25.769> step<00:00:25.949> because<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.310> other

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
start with this step because the other

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.009 
start with this step because the other
steps<00:00:26.760> were<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.300> little<00:00:27.840> messy<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.380> film<00:00:30.019> but

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
steps were a little messy to film but

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.229 
steps were a little messy to film but
now<00:00:31.170> I'm<00:00:31.500> applying<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:31.980> a<00:00:32.189> special<00:00:32.640> oil

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
now I'm applying it a special oil

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.639 
now I'm applying it a special oil
it's<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:34.190> oil<00:00:35.190> that's<00:00:35.579> using<00:00:36.030> cosmetics<00:00:36.719> so

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
it's a oil that's using cosmetics so

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.830 
it's a oil that's using cosmetics so
it's<00:00:37.770> very<00:00:37.950> safe<00:00:38.250> for<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:39.149> leather<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.629> for

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
it's very safe for the leather and for

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.770 
it's very safe for the leather and for
the<00:00:39.899> worker<00:00:40.129> it's<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.250> lower<00:00:41.790> viscosity<00:00:42.120> than

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
the worker it's a lower viscosity than

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.630 
the worker it's a lower viscosity than
water<00:00:43.020> by<00:00:43.290> quite<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.590> few<00:00:43.649> points<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.370> so<00:00:44.489> it

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
water by quite a few points and so it

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.660 
water by quite a few points and so it
goes<00:00:44.820> right<00:00:44.940> in<00:00:45.510> this<00:00:46.140> crocodile<00:00:46.460> even<00:00:47.460> in<00:00:47.579> his

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
goes right in this crocodile even in his

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.270 
goes right in this crocodile even in his
freshly<00:00:47.940> tan<00:00:48.390> State<00:00:48.840> is<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.410> bit<00:00:49.710> forty<00:00:50.100> and

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
freshly tan State is a bit forty and

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.250 
freshly tan State is a bit forty and
loses<00:00:50.670> moisture<00:00:50.850> over<00:00:51.420> time<00:00:51.660> just<00:00:51.989> because

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
loses moisture over time just because

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.010 
loses moisture over time just because
ambient<00:00:52.980> humidity<00:00:53.539> won't<00:00:54.539> drain<00:00:54.780> that

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
ambient humidity won't drain that

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.290 
ambient humidity won't drain that
moisture<00:00:55.500> out<00:00:55.680> so<00:00:55.920> this<00:00:56.250> oil<00:00:56.610> goes<00:00:56.910> through

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
moisture out so this oil goes through

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.010 
moisture out so this oil goes through
even<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:58.289> hard<00:00:58.530> rocket<00:00:59.160> I'll<00:00:59.660> top<00:01:00.660> grain

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
even this hard rocket I'll top grain

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.680 
even this hard rocket I'll top grain
which<00:01:01.289> is<00:01:01.500> almost<00:01:02.070> armor-plated<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.149> way<00:01:03.270> the

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
which is almost armor-plated the way the

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.020 
which is almost armor-plated the way the
animals<00:01:04.110> made<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:05.100> actually<00:01:05.250> can<00:01:05.610> go<00:01:05.729> through

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
animals made it actually can go through

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.940 
animals made it actually can go through
that<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.510> begin<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.409> see<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.740> brings

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
that and begin and you see it brings

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.770 
that and begin and you see it brings
back<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.220> lot<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.670> natural<00:01:08.850> color<00:01:09.330> in<00:01:09.630> the

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
back a lot of the natural color in the

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.219 
back a lot of the natural color in the
leather<00:01:09.960> which<00:01:10.260> is<00:01:10.409> nice<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:11.869> this<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:12.930> what

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
leather which is nice and this is what

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.050 
leather which is nice and this is what
it<00:01:13.320> looks<00:01:13.470> like<00:01:13.560> before<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.430> oil<00:01:14.460> and<00:01:14.939> this<00:01:15.000> is

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
it looks like before the oil and this is

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.700 
it looks like before the oil and this is
what<00:01:15.299> looks<00:01:15.450> like<00:01:15.509> after<00:01:16.020> now<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.200> oil<00:01:16.290> will

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
what looks like after now the oil will

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.609 
what looks like after now the oil will
soak<00:01:17.040> in<00:01:17.400> in<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:18.030> few<00:01:18.060> minutes<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.780> you'll<00:01:19.380> see

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
soak in in a few minutes and you'll see

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.890 
soak in in a few minutes and you'll see
that<00:01:19.799> won't<00:01:20.040> be<00:01:20.159> permitted<00:01:20.610> now<00:01:21.540> on<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.750> other

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
that won't be permitted now on the other

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.070 
that won't be permitted now on the other
side<00:01:22.049> after<00:01:22.680> doing<00:01:22.979> this<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:26.150> then<00:01:27.150> put<00:01:27.509> on<00:01:27.750> a

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
side after doing this I then put on a

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.100 
side after doing this I then put on a
sealer<00:01:28.500> primer<00:01:28.950> before<00:01:29.430> I<00:01:29.460> do<00:01:29.579> my<00:01:29.729> my<00:01:30.689> final

this<00:02:13.350> is<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.590> one<00:02:13.740> I<00:02:13.770> like<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.070> best<00:02:14.280> I<00:02:14.640> think

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
this is the one I like the best I think

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.850 
this is the one I like the best I think
this<00:02:15.060> is<00:02:15.360> a<00:02:15.420> darkest<00:02:15.960> that<00:02:16.140> can<00:02:16.290> get<00:02:16.500> this<00:02:16.710> is

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
this is a darkest that can get this is

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.710 
this is a darkest that can get this is
the<00:02:16.980> lightest<00:02:17.400> and<00:02:17.580> it's<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.270> shade<00:02:18.480> in

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
the lightest and it's the shade in

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.830 
the lightest and it's the shade in
between<00:02:18.920> those<00:02:19.920> two<00:02:20.250> that'll<00:02:21.060> be<00:02:21.210> what<00:02:21.420> I<00:02:21.450> have

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
between those two that'll be what I have

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.730 
between those two that'll be what I have
up<00:02:21.990> on<00:02:22.200> here<00:02:22.530> and<00:02:23.750> so<00:02:24.750> this<00:02:24.900> is<00:02:25.050> as<00:02:25.200> far<00:02:25.410> as<00:02:25.440> I've

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
up on here and so this is as far as I've

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.440 
up on here and so this is as far as I've
gotten<00:02:25.980> once<00:02:26.310> I<00:02:26.460> do<00:02:26.520> some<00:02:26.820> color<00:02:27.060> work<00:02:27.240> we'll

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
gotten once I do some color work we'll

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.600 
gotten once I do some color work we'll
film<00:02:27.690> some<00:02:28.020> more<00:02:28.050> as<00:02:28.350> that<00:02:28.380> you<00:02:28.620> can<00:02:28.830> see<00:02:29.100> the

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
film some more as that you can see the

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.400 
film some more as that you can see the
progress<00:02:29.940> of<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.480> color<00:02:30.720> work<00:02:30.960> over<00:02:31.320> the

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
progress of the color work over the

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.070 
progress of the color work over the
primer<00:02:31.710> and<00:02:32.400> let<00:02:33.150> me<00:02:33.270> see<00:02:33.450> if<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.630> oil<00:02:33.660> is

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
primer and let me see if the oil is

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.770 
primer and let me see if the oil is
drying<00:02:34.440> on<00:02:34.620> the<00:02:34.680> backside<00:02:35.250> now<00:02:35.490> it's<00:02:36.390> starting

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
drying on the backside now it's starting

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.480 
drying on the backside now it's starting
to<00:02:36.810> soak<00:02:37.110> in<00:02:37.320> as<00:02:37.410> you<00:02:37.530> can<00:02:37.740> see<00:02:37.950> it<00:02:38.070> goes<00:02:38.280> in

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
to soak in as you can see it goes in

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.560 
to soak in as you can see it goes in
through<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.910> low<00:02:39.120> areas<00:02:39.630> of<00:02:39.930> the<00:02:40.140> scales<00:02:40.500> and

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
through the low areas of the scales and

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.510 
through the low areas of the scales and
one<00:02:42.570> of<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:42.750> features<00:02:43.290> of<00:02:43.440> all<00:02:43.830> leathers<00:02:44.280> all

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
one of the features of all leathers all

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.550 
one of the features of all leathers all
animal<00:02:44.880> skins<00:02:45.180> is<00:02:45.450> once<00:02:45.690> things<00:02:45.960> penetrate

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
animal skins is once things penetrate

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.800 
animal skins is once things penetrate
they<00:02:46.950> migrate<00:02:47.460> laterally<00:02:48.090> so<00:02:48.120> it<00:02:48.390> goes<00:02:48.570> in

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
they migrate laterally so it goes in

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.780 
they migrate laterally so it goes in
here<00:02:48.840> and<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.830> low<00:02:49.980> areas<00:02:50.310> and<00:02:50.490> begins<00:02:50.700> to

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
here and the low areas and begins to

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.820 
here and the low areas and begins to
move<00:02:51.030> into<00:02:51.210> the<00:02:51.360> plates<00:02:51.630> and<00:02:51.960> opening<00:02:52.680> back

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
move into the plates and opening back

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.150 
move into the plates and opening back
the<00:02:53.010> oil<00:02:53.190> to<00:02:53.490> those<00:02:53.670> areas<00:02:54.290> so<00:02:55.290> that's<00:02:55.530> as<00:02:55.890> far

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
the oil to those areas so that's as far

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.790 
the oil to those areas so that's as far
as<00:02:56.220> we've<00:02:56.490> gotten<00:02:56.520> so<00:02:57.120> far<00:02:57.500> when<00:02:58.500> we're<00:02:58.650> done

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
as we've gotten so far when we're done

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.520 
as we've gotten so far when we're done
hopefully<00:02:59.310> we'll<00:02:59.490> have<00:02:59.670> this<00:02:59.940> matched<00:03:00.530> this

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
hopefully we'll have this matched this

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.310 
hopefully we'll have this matched this
inside<00:03:02.190> color<00:03:02.490> which<00:03:02.730> is<00:03:02.910> really<00:03:03.120> pristine<00:03:03.750> it

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
target for me in my color work that

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.170 
target for me in my color work that
that's<00:03:12.780> like<00:03:13.050> that<00:03:13.290> and<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.980> sides<00:03:14.220> are<00:03:14.490> in

going<00:03:17.520> to<00:03:18.170> remove<00:03:19.170> this<00:03:19.410> is<00:03:19.530> the<00:03:19.620> last<00:03:19.860> vestige

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
going to remove this is the last vestige

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.240 
going to remove this is the last vestige
of<00:03:20.459> his<00:03:20.700> color<00:03:21.000> over<00:03:21.959> here<00:03:21.989> that<00:03:22.709> little<00:03:22.980> light

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
of his color over here that little light

blue area
I<00:03:24.120> left<00:03:24.510> that<00:03:24.690> just<00:03:24.989> as<00:03:25.170> a<00:03:25.200> kind<00:03:26.100> of<00:03:26.220> a<00:03:26.280> contrast

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
I left that just as a kind of a contrast

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.729 
I left that just as a kind of a contrast
for<00:03:27.060> where<00:03:27.300> I'm<00:03:27.570> going<00:03:27.930> to<00:03:28.110> from<00:03:28.380> where<00:03:28.530> he

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
for where I'm going to from where he

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.190 
for where I'm going to from where he
went<00:03:28.940> and<00:03:29.940> I<00:03:30.180> think<00:03:30.390> I've<00:03:30.510> gotten<00:03:30.720> everything

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
went and I think I've gotten everything

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.830 
went and I think I've gotten everything
else<00:03:31.350> off<00:03:31.560> so<00:03:31.800> I<00:03:31.980> have<00:03:32.160> a<00:03:32.220> nice<00:03:32.540> nice<00:03:33.540> variety

else off so I have a nice nice variety

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.430 
else off so I have a nice nice variety
of<00:03:34.050> colors<00:03:34.410> on<00:03:34.590> this<00:03:34.739> to<00:03:34.920> match<00:03:35.100> too<00:03:35.660> and<00:03:36.660> so

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
of colors on this to match too and so

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.810 
of colors on this to match too and so
that's<00:03:37.650> as<00:03:37.770> far<00:03:37.920> as<00:03:37.980> we've<00:03:38.160> gotten<00:03:38.190> right<00:03:38.550> now

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820
