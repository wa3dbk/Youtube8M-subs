00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.339
 parts 

00:00:01.339 --> 00:00:04.100
 when you lay the whole wall can 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.840
 prove that it overlaps 

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.579
 longer or vice versa 

00:00:08.579 --> 00:00:10.189
 It's not a problem 

00:00:10.189 --> 00:00:11.989
 the fit is made about 

00:00:11.989 --> 00:00:14.249
 increase in rub or decrease 

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:15.839
 separation distance 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.900
 guide on base plates 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.970
 this is achieved by neat 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.409
 beating plates outside 

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:23.889
 at this moment you shoot 

00:00:23.889 --> 00:00:27.139
 guide or to remove 

00:00:27.139 --> 00:00:28.830
 overlaying the edges of the wall 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.130
 should be slightly knock out plates from 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.000
 nutria 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.790
 thus increasing 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.100
 distance between guides on 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.150
 base plates 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.230
 when did you work this way 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.290
 over several plates 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.620
 gently move the wall 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.940
 in the appropriate direction until those 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:47.410
 pore 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.800
 until the hole in the edges of the wall 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.610
 will not match 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.749
 and you can see that the producers 

00:00:54.749 --> 00:00:56.439
 just eliminated the gap 

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:57.920
 very easy 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.680
 also be able to 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.640
 put it on plastic washers 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.339
 on the bolts 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:06.060
 and inserting a screwdriver into one of the holes for 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.399
 fixing the wall 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:09.930
 put a ball on the supervision of any country 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.100
 and tighten and nuts outside 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.159
 fasten the bolts and securely 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.439
 and cover the heads with several layers 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.770
 duct tape 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.100
 which will serve as ipo protection for the web 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.530
 at this stage 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.270
 inserted final 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.960
 fixing tube 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.900
 the wall must be from on 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.080
 one level around the entire pool circumference 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.869
 if that didn't work out 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:35.789
 sort things out the wall and level the grounds 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:37.290
 again 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.900
 remove plywood 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.990
 and scatter sand 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.580
 rake is not around the perimeter 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.530
 at the same time removing any stones that can 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:46.810
 cut the canvas 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.270
 form the arch 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.429
 20 centimeters high and ask has 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:53.130
 man pool walls 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.100
 to support the canvas 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.860
 and prevent it from damaging the wall when 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:58.740
 contacts 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.340
 sharp-edged 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.480
 with per year 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.580
 very essential element of your 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:05.430
 the pool 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.330
 extremely important for protection 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.899
 canvases 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.629
 when done with the vault 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:13.109
 level the rake again not the base 

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:14.639
 the pool 

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:16.150
 hand over the canvas 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.299
 useful with apexim tube technician and 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:20.409
 connections to keep them 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:22.219
 fixed position 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:23.780
 bring the canvas 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.250
 carefully place it inside and find 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.400
 Nitina wall try not to break 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.029
 on a flat sand surface 

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:32.839
 when stretch the canvas 

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:35.939
 but these threads are about 30 centimeters at the top 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:37.840
 parts of the canvas on the wall 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.239
 and secure it temporary flexible 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.429
 plastic cap 

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:43.480
 as you can see 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.909
 cap keep the canvas while 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:48.709
 you are on the body and its rest 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.169
 canvas overlap 

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:51.469
 distributed 

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:54.529
 around the entire circumference of the wall 

00:02:54.529 --> 00:02:57.019
 How to continue putting on 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:57.570
 canvases 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.690
 seal the holes baby measures 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.199
 several layers of duct tape 

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:04.499
 the reason for this will be from explained 

00:03:04.499 --> 00:03:05.689
 carcasses 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:08.029
 now go to the issue of matthew number 

00:03:08.029 --> 00:03:08.540
 empires 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.349
 and your home vacuum cleaner tick off 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:13.299
 outlet hole distance 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.939
 so that it does not reach the ground by about 30 

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:16.780
 centimeters 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.620
 using a vacuum cleaner hose then 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.879
 for the essence of the hose in the hole give least 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:22.700
 slow 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.739
 and securely secure ashland in this 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:25.640
 position 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.110
 making sure there is no hose around 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.099
 holes 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:31.479
 and turn on the vacuum cleaner 

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:32.540
 in fact 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.650
 air displacement occurs 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.469
 between the pool wall and the canvas 

00:03:37.469 --> 00:03:39.859
 with the vacuum cleaner running 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:41.090
 soft brush 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.879
 and nail the canvas from the bottom 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:46.400
 this will help to draw the canvas to the walls 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.829
 and stretch it in the pool 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:49.909
 may be necessary 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:51.109
 to pull 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:52.860
 more canvases on the wall 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.780
 after this action anyway this 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.090
 the only question is the removal of the top caps 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.440
 on you are not big long canvases on 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.809
 the wall and on the couch cap again 

00:04:03.809 --> 00:04:06.350
 take this operation so much time 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.580
 how much is required for stretching 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.779
 web and warehouse disposal 

00:04:10.779 --> 00:04:13.539
 when the caps are put on make sure that 

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:14.659
 their ends 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:17.479
 located close to each other from the river 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:20.639
 all unnecessary to avoid overlap 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.520
 when this stage is over 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.509
 you can start to fill the pool 

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:25.509
 by water 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:27.650
 let the vacuum cleaner work while the depth 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:30.020
 water will not reach fifteen twenty 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.490
 centimeters 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:32.680
 make sure 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.979
 darned sons that you use 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:36.599
 properly grounded 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:39.930
 and don't stand on wet or wet ground 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.389
 when working with electric 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:43.430
 equipment near water should be 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.389
 take extra care 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:47.240
 as the pool fills 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.849
 by water 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:50.470
 these superfluous cattle lost chambers up 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:51.550
 caps 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.409
 and fasten it in several places 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:57.770
 at the sight of tee it around the whole pool 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.710
 when will the top guides replace 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.750
 they will close the extra material 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.750
 and give the wall a finished look 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.279
 next step 

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:09.769
 installation of vertical 

00:05:09.769 --> 00:05:12.039
 supporting arikat repulse 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:13.749
 the support is installed 

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:15.319
 below 

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:17.599
 set the pore time outside the plate 

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:19.840
 and fasten screws with screws 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.069
 which are attached 

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:24.479
 the top plate will be located 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:27.289
 over the cap and in this position will 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:29.569
 located outside the support 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:31.389
 again using a screw 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:34.479
 secure the top plate and support 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:37.729
 support must be strictly vertically 

00:05:37.729 --> 00:05:40.080
 this can be checked using levels 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.379
 or swiping your finger along the prop 

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:43.879
 parallel to the wall 

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:45.650
 in some models of pools 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.990
 there are additional supporting 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.750
 plates 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.680
 which are put on the top plate for 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.360
 careless not extra 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.680
 stability and stability of the top 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.979
 guide rail 

00:05:56.979 --> 00:05:57.909
 check out 

00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:59.939
 supplied in the pool by these 

00:05:59.939 --> 00:06:02.389
 supporting plates before 

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:04.099
 continue installation 

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:05.860
 once installed all 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:08.219
 historians support and support plates 

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:11.039
 You can proceed to install and top 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:12.169
 guides 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:14.340
 there is a hole 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:17.009
 matching the holes up them 

00:06:17.009 --> 00:06:17.900
 plates 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.900
 and they are screwed with screws 

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:24.379
 for your pool may require 2 

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:27.189
 or 3 screws at each concert and 

00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:28.080
 guide rail 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.950
 in case of small piedmont 

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:31.900
 at first she sees all the upper ones 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:33.070
 guide rail 

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:34.950
 until a specific location is determined 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:36.349
 each 

00:06:36.349 --> 00:06:38.050
 when you satisfy from 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:39.930
 exact position every 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:42.370
 should stop them tightly 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:44.310
 and then you can do the following 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:45.419
 step 

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:47.830
 connector installation 

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:50.680
 main task and top connectors 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.910
 cover over 40 between guides together 

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:56.910
 their connections and improve the look of the pool 

00:06:57.439 --> 00:06:59.129
 solid connector 

00:06:59.129 --> 00:07:00.679
 clings to the inside 

00:07:00.679 --> 00:07:01.749
 pool 

00:07:01.749 --> 00:07:03.320
 front plate 

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.320
 bent on the outside 

00:07:06.909 --> 00:07:08.569
 if your pool 

00:07:08.569 --> 00:07:11.619
 connect two parts for round and 

00:07:11.619 --> 00:07:13.249
 straight part of the pool 

00:07:13.249 --> 00:07:14.550
 inner part 

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.830
 easy to fit on inner edges 

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:19.090
 directing the inner country itself 

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:20.490
 the pool 

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:21.899
 internal parts 

00:07:21.899 --> 00:07:23.830
 inserted into the outer 

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.270
 and additionally screwed one 

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:29.270
 or more screws screws 

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:35.749
 remember again 

00:07:35.749 --> 00:07:38.119
 different parts of pools of different
