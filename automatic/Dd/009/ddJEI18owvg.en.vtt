00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:08.970
 hello today the weather is not quite 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:12.509
 the flight went for a walk land 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.490
 very wet all the clay around it all 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.190
 slippery climb impossible 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.550
 almost hifu summer slaps 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:25.140
 almost in the general distance got to 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:27.510
 groves took to try feels 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.840
 that an operator is needed here 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:34.530
 uighur knife carbon downhill 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.530
 Scandinavian especially not to bring him not to 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.710
 what is there given a small burr still there 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:44.730
 he is such a nice place all this 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:49.860
 reground when he began to have his nose here 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:52.860
 prickles takes well here dry stick 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.530
 look at all so it will be necessary to take 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:01.399
 operator as the whole corner is pretty 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.399
 small how it will be about 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.740
 amortizing very cool 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:27.070
 Well, the conclusions are sad for this knife but 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:30.070
 not eat well will be visible with try 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.070
 take off 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:39.189
 you can see how he bends the principle of the second 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.219
 I dragged the small knife completely 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:47.250
 under comics because 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:49.750
 piece of iron to say the least not for these purposes 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.899
 to drag very easily the only thing 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.679
 gets covered very cool corrosion have 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:59.439
 unpolished 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:02:10.769
 But in general, what is the angle we will 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:10.769
 it is completely uncomfortable to change 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.790
 yes here 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.260
 not really 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:41.560
 that is, this place is not at all 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:46.860
 want an incomprehensible button walks where 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.860
 wants to try again 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.320
 I'm here this place 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:19.280
 eyes nothing at all 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:25.370
 compared to how here it will be seen 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:27.400
 Can not see this device should not compact 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:31.579
 take this mill 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:34.790
 but since the hands are called other 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:38.569
 pretty bamboo coach options 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:42.430
 thick wall is it the same 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:48.919
 plucking up the maximum density and 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:55.840
 strength so yes something with this knife 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:55.840
 not so now try another tip myself 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:38.039
 on the tip is also not so sad here 

00:04:31.539 --> 00:04:38.039
 probably try on a dark background 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.870
 to show 

00:04:57.129 --> 00:05:01.319
 then I hope it will be seen 

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:13.660
 no special damage but this one 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.660
 part 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:31.670
 quite bent possible 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:36.250
 overheated that strange behavior with one 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:41.440
 sides everything is okay in the middle is terrible 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:45.650
 a lot of bends on the tip, too, in principle 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:48.770
 there is nothing critical but it is so 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:52.850
 retreat waiting when he arrives there 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:58.460
 a pair of knives with similar steel there h12mf 

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:59.780
 and up to 20 plus some carbons we 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.460
 let's see something else 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:06.110
 I hope today can go to the post office 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:14.540
 will come on so walk overall breathe 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:17.590
 the air got out such things that the corners with 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:21.020
 such an angle of course and the point to cut but 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:26.830
 no critical damage 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:26.830
 is all good luck to all until
