00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:05.970
 before the short test starts here 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.919
 from metro last light a few short corners 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.950
 data about the system I use the 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:13.110
 both geforce gtx 680 exotic from 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.590
 tested board partner point of view 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.760
 have 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:20.760
 as mainboard the msz 77 m power board 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.119
 as a working memory 16 gb corsair 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.160
 engines ram with the timing of 1600 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.590
 megawatt in dual channel operation 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:34.410
 as cpu we have an intel core i7 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:37.500
 3770 k cpu from me to 46 ghz 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.899
 overclocked was thus 4,600 megawatts 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.450
 why did I do that because the two of them 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.460
 exotic the two 680 exotic 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.739
 mind you from the board partner point of 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.690
 view already overclocked I have 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.460
 I thought about tactics also the cpu around 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.399
 the maximum performance here too 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.079
 reach in the test as ssd where 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.809
 also the operating system is located on it 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.870
 I have a samsung 840 with a ssd 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.210
 storage capacity of 250 gb on the 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.350
 the games in the case metro and 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.659
 of course, the operating system 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.200
 what else are windows 7 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.330
 Professional 64 bit is all 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.840
 important data such as had to know for 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.840
 this test 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.060
 people I'm testing here just a round 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.370
 metro last light and have one more 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.890
 additional gtx 680 exotic 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.800
 Unpacked then a free system 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.980
 to test with two geforce gtx 680 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.480
 exotic from the board power point of view 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.400
 and because metro last light give so much 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.350
 performance deadline or because of it 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.720
 I used up so much resources 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.150
 today eager to see to what extent 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.740
 the gestik 680 exotic he even 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.260
 have more power than a standard 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.120
 gtx 680 are here with just behave 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.530
 the frames and actually I wanted 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.150
 No video but I thought so 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.590
 Show my pulse this crass 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.600
 difference that the world will see 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.860
 from the frames because I think that must 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.510
 you have just seen 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.790
 and now that belongs to me here 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.950
 possibility is given mezler 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.870
 try 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.160
 would like to show something for a while and see 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.810
 you are watching them right now 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.910
 just the frames per second here the 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:13.310
 both workloads of the two must go 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:17.330
 from the two gigs 680 and see here 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:19.760
 her the video memory usage which I 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.870
 want to show you now is and indeed 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.370
 I have just those 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.150
 highest possible graphics settings 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:29.060
 used up to one level and though 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:31.010
 the ssh worth the maximum goes 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.900
 until the fourth step and I have then 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.370
 put on the second level and there 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.110
 I'm just so wavering right now 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.080
 Of course I want to move naturally 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:44.030
 further down and so I say now 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:48.200
 times 75 80 runs up to 85 varies 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:54.920
 frames per second so a bit on 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:58.580
 the pictures are so vigorous right now 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.680
 if we go into the menu now 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.750
 time briefly under options game options 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.300
 show it for six is ​​natural 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.950
 activated here should be on now 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.140
 the graphics settings there you see 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.780
 I have the usual full HD resolution 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.880
 1020 2080 all other quality 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.709
 grading levels are at the highest 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.019
 level to the highest possible value 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.150
 set each case very high 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:22.190
 Everything else is also at its maximum 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.330
 possible set every game knows 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.290
 or have ever seen somewhere knows 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.969
 that the 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.310
 by setting are only here 

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:30.049
 I only have that ssh value 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.030
 Twice tried there you have right now 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:33.890
 seen that vary in between has 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.140
 70s range to over the eighties 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.219
 area of ​​images per second and now 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.870
 I'll switch to the 

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:40.939
 the highest possible value here is then the 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.470
 fourfold area I always have to be short 

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:46.310
 confirm it just takes a few short 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.239
 seconds until he accepts that and then 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.260
 you have to go straight to the pictures 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:53.959
 Pay attention to the power of difference 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.189
 and mind you two gigs 680 exo the in 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.900
 have a higher rate than one 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:04:00.349
 reference card name more power than the 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:03.319
 club 680 and siblings at inn only 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:05.780
 about 45 pictures now just 40 like that 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:08.299
 So we have almost 40 to 50 percent 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.709
 the frames is lost now talk 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:10.689
 the pictures look like I'm running so 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:14.840
 a little bit around 

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:16.400
 35 So what is really the absolute 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:20.259
 hardcore madness like many free spaces 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:22.070
 loses that is really hardcore 

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:25.970
 I think that's pretty impressive 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:27.889
 So you just have to say so 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:29.930
 At least one high end can be needed 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:30.979
 already really nice did or 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:33.560
 not done 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:35.570
 to be on the highest possible level here 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.190
 can play graphic with a map and 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.419
 even that would have to be true to her 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.280
 calculate power limit 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:42.169
 that was yes I wanted to briefly once 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.720
 Now give a little insight that metro 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:47.000
 Last light real game is something extreme 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.220
 a lot of performance needs to be said 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.669
 actually only has to do a lot 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:56.479
 If you are here in the 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:58.220
 options is and ssv is the 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:00.320
 highest level 1 presents this fourfold 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.419
 if you play only twice now 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.340
 You can do that wonderfully with very high 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:07.780
 frame will be as we have seen 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:12.199
 with well , I gtx time 670 or hd 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:15.470
 7150 7079 or a reference 680 play 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:16.820
 or even now the new gtx l 770 or 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:19.220
 What ever 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.990
 Definitely if you are on the 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.580
 the highest value you have here 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.530
 just seen how many pictures one 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.810
 loses and even with the knife 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:29.360
 a team of the two 6 80 years the 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.470
 of just when I was only a 680 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.389
 now time for the people that this 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:35.300
 maybe I was so interested 

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:36.710
 vary between 25 and 30 pictures without 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.480
 without big ones 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.130
 This movement means that if there is still 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.300
 support for combat somehow advance 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.020
 and pictures of course still extremely much 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.340
 continue 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.340
 I want to tell you that on the 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:50.390
 highest level of the game itself one 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:51.200
 ovum 680 totally overwhelmed and has 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:52.370
 not enough power 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.990
 I had to go twice 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.090
 value down with it so I with one 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.950
 680 can play fluently and even a lot 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.390
 seen but with the sl it is curious 

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:01.820
 yes could be in some areas 

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:03.920
 but enough talk i hope this one 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:04.970
 small brief insight from the metro last 

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.650
 light liked you 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.940
 bye until next time we namely 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:11.290
 As always comments reviews 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.290
 everything subscribe friend until then
