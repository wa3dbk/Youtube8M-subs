00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:25.310
 welcome today we talk about parrot sic 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:27.349
 a pair of headphones with 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.869
 particular characteristics 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:32.570
 roberto these drops first of all 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:35.120
 the bluetooth wifi connection in this 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:38.239
 case there are a pair of sovra headphones 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:41.480
 oral as we see and interface 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.800
 through bluetooth precisely but 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.000
 iphone 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.120
 we have the application we can 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.670
 download from the app store and and that will talk 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.869
 directly with a chip inside it 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.549
 in this application allows for 

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:56.089
 example of activating one of the functions 

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:58.519
 by special ie noise reduction 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:01.189
 look at the back 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:02.629
 we have several microphones that will allow 

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:05.239
 precisely with a special algorithm of 

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:08.270
 pick up the brightness of the room and 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.650
 then limit the disturbances set 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.220
 pity most of the 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.350
 music that was always escort the noise 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:18.049
 that of us centers have nothing left 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.520
 please remove it please 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:23.500
 then when I tell you some more 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.750
 special feature forgiveness i hear you 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.950
 that I feel great 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.409
 here is practically touched on 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.480
 pavilion under the right pavilion has 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:35.540
 practically from the contacts this is the 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.400
 touch rocker surface that I remember 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.830
 which then practically turn up the volume e 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.930
 lower the volume with a movement 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.050
 from top to bottom in reverse it is 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.210
 also change the played song 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:52.040
 with horizontal movements it will come more 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:54.500
 nobody seems very elegant to me 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.240
 there are perfectly comfortable pavilions 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.659
 quite soft isolate already 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.640
 of course maybe I 'm a little hot and 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.610
 so for the summer sectors perhaps 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.370
 card and dangers 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.230
 long journeys but the battery how much 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:10.740
 tough is the battery clearly depends 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:13.320
 from the volume was where you listen to the songs 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:16.020
 however from 6 to 8 hours should 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.100
 be almost insured and as you understand a 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.950
 right and left 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.080
 so there is an elle of how to al 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.340
 usually it should be gathered 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.340
 in perfect 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:53.349
 let's say they are headphones that whole 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.330
 of technologies that at present 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:59.180
 they are also paid, however, more or less is 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:01.849
 however future evolution is there 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.160
 wireless magic was a bang of money 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:07.459
 these cost 299 euros and you also pay for 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:10.489
 design, however, the choice, as mentioned above 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:13.310
 they are special headphones with technologies 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:15.709
 specials that probably in the next 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.629
 a we will start to see also seems to have merged to 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.120
 lower cost but presenting euro per 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:24.920
 hear nothing 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:27.980
 yes, however, parish priests that as said 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:31.459
 299 I was a product now it was 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.590
 enthusiasts, of course, but the audio is 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.299
 quite good as they are quality 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.370
 comfortable and definitely roberta 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:38.930
 you can no longer do this comfortably 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.780
 heavy on average but I think it is 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.790
 necessary for all material that 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.280
 it is not plasticis not good metal and 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:49.099
 well done it is made to refine anything 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.540
 ok thanks for following us all 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:52.900
 see you next time 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.900
 Thanks for your attention
