00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.519
 hello very welcome to another video 

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:14.519
 how to paint and we'll be giving 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.500
 continuity to toucan painting 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.810
 the last video you saw how we 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.770
 made the background of the picture now we go 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.390
 end it 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.270
 Let's start our painting with the 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.410
 yellow ocher white mix 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:30.840
 let's apply the law on the neck of the toucan 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:33.270
 apply on the top and one thing and the 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.180
 mix a little darker around 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:45.090
 now with pure cadmium orange 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:46.530
 Let's make a beak of the toucan 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.950
 part of the bikini in the 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.950
 low 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.000
 with a slightly thinner brush and 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.160
 red french 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.410
 I make the outline of the beak in the parts 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:02.620
 darker red beak 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.620
 see only 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.790
 and now compensate a little wider 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.630
 I'm warnings the mix between red 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:16.560
 French and position of orange 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:19.560
 see only I enjoy with French red 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.530
 of those blasted by burst paint 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:33.450
 that the beak of the toucan has and with a 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:35.970
 softened brush made the encounter a 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.600
 vandick brown thin brush starts to 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.090
 detailing the nozzle make the outline of it and 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.610
 split into the beak with the yellow mixture 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.220
 and some white details there in the beak 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.160
 now skirts the part of his eye with 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.130
 orange and then with that 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:57.330
 blend of white with easy cobalt blue 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.950
 the inner part of the eye and adding 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.360
 a little violet this mixture 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.130
 Enjoy and already do the tucano's paw 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:09.080
 make a blend of black and violet and 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.080
 begins to paint the whole body of the toucan 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.150
 the underside of the wings and chest 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.840
 at the beginning of the beak of the toucan on the head 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.840
 his 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.230
 I also enjoy painting the final part 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.230
 of his beak where it has a black spot 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.120
 and round his eye fill in the 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:04.730
 internal and external 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:06.170
 we also skirt the tucano's legs and 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.480
 soon thereafter with a mixture of 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.629
 white and cobalt blue some details 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.129
 on paws with pure white people 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:15.200
 can give that brightness in the eye of the 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:17.060
 Toucan 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.209
 added the mixture of 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.909
 black with violet we start to give 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:26.139
 the details of feathers in the 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:26.139
 his body clear 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.569
 and to finish with pure white I give the 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.799
 final detail there on his neck in 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:37.799
 area where it is lighter 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:58.150
 and there is our finished toucan 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:59.860
 cool, I hope you liked it
