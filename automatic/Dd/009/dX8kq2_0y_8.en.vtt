00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hello everyone with you as always harn and this 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.879
 heading up to the thighs where you can 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.389
 Improve your game level by learning 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.679
 several subtleties and tricks dota 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:12.900
 the first thing we talk about today is 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.529
 a couple of unpleasant skills such as re-range 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.330
 that yes and ultimate osip it would seem for and 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.369
 see these rocks and can only be 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.080
 at a sufficient distance from the enemy 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.570
 but having a blink dagger in my inventory 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.109
 or blink ability you can 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.050
 declare 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.699
 these ultimate and even being nearby 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.500
 I think everyone knows that the animation of these 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.320
 Ultimate does not diverge immediately 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.719
 gradually from the hero it takes 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.030
 about one two seconds than we and 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.730
 use at the time of use 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.770
 Ultimate at that to the tentacle uefa soul 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.719
 fly out from the hero himself and moves 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.700
 wave at a rather large radius 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.800
 so as not to be affected either 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.570
 one of these ultimate games we should 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.510
 blink as close to the enemy as possible 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.260
 something like this 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.059
 naturally you should be as close as possible 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.059
 attentive and quick 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.250
 many players don't know how to get out 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.470
 cult we are this shadow shaman seemingly 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.930
 the answer is simple I am sure everyone remembered at once 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.520
 force staff a bunch or some blink but 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.830
 what if you don't have anything like that 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.110
 the answer is really simple facebook 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.210
 besides the fact that they perform their 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.950
 the main function is that your 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.439
 husband sleeps and is allowed to pass 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.970
 through units with them you can 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.970
 get out of the serpent shadow shaman 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:35.760
 I know for sure that virtually every one of 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.290
 you saw such a picture axon druid either 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.940
 any other forester before 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.320
 farm creeps often puts 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.900
 you tramp inventory 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.600
 and very often I hear such a question why 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.670
 all this is necessary in order not to 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.740
 knocks action tranquillo ie 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.080
 not to wait 13 seconds from the map 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.080
 tranquil can just throw them away 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:57.119
 you will not kill the creeps often this trick 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.369
 leads to the destruction of your tranquil 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.660
 enemy hero shadow blade 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.270
 is one of the most bought 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.399
 pub items that's why in it 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.200
 hidden too many tricks for example 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.179
 shadow blade doesn't immediately make you 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.480
 invisible state transition invisibility 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.790
 takes 0.3 seconds like this you 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.910
 you can use it for example 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:21.120
 in 0.3 seconds you can manage to turn on the BKB 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:23.670
 manta satanic miller use dagon 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.500
 and any skill not having animation caste 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.780
 all this can greatly affect 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.060
 the outcome of the fight and here's your information from 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.519
 discharge is not so important than we know what 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.459
 the fountain sees in Vinnikov but not everyone knows 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:40.130
 what he sees not in all places for example 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.130
 in this place as you understand, I do not see 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.329
 i always liked paternal shift 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.060
 using shift 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:50.489
 and Dagueru can get out of the bathing yes here 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.709
 so here is something here 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:55.079
 subtleties to get out of the dome of the void 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.269
 you need to go before using the dome 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:59.790
 shift and blink into that direction 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:02.100
 watched the pack for trying to blink 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.230
 nothing will come out the other way 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:09.900
 how blink needs to be done instantly not 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:12.329
 spending time on the turn here and went to 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.280
 the end of the third release to the lab I want to 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:16.769
 report what is now a dota heading for 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.560
 zadrota will not be the names themselves replaced 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.780
 on dota lvl ap the fact is that the old 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.480
 I didnâ€™t like the name very much 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:28.310
 thawed paws sound somehow more serious on 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.310
 I'll see you all this bye
