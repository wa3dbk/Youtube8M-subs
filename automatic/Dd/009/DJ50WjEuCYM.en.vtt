00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.450 
on traditionally 11 to 11 and a half and
this<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:06.930> little<00:01:07.229> roomy<00:01:07.650> but<00:01:07.860> just<00:01:08.340> by<00:01:08.430> a

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
this is a little roomy but just by a

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.740 
this is a little roomy but just by a
little<00:01:08.640> bit<00:01:08.820> like<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:09.000> said<00:01:09.180> go<00:01:09.360> on<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.510> store

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
little bit like I said go on the store

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.050 
little bit like I said go on the store
try<00:01:10.439> them<00:01:10.590> out<00:01:10.710> but<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.400> locks<00:01:11.610> down<00:01:11.820> at<00:01:12.000> the

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
try them out but it locks down at the

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.200 
try them out but it locks down at the
heel<00:01:12.619> exceptionally<00:01:13.619> well<00:01:13.770> I<00:01:14.130> think<00:01:14.850> it

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
heel exceptionally well I think it

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.810 
heel exceptionally well I think it
leaves<00:01:15.710> as<00:01:16.710> far<00:01:16.950> as<00:01:17.040> weight<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:17.430> concerned

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
leaves as far as weight is concerned

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.510 
leaves as far as weight is concerned
like<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.060> told<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.450> these<00:01:18.630> run<00:01:19.140> at<00:01:19.320> around<00:01:19.530> 11

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
like I told you these run at around 11

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.670 
like I told you these run at around 11
and<00:01:20.640> 12<00:01:20.790> ounces<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:21.630> it's<00:01:21.960> an<00:01:22.080> extremely<00:01:22.439> light

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
and 12 ounces so it's an extremely light

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.320 
and 12 ounces so it's an extremely light
shoe<00:01:22.979> when<00:01:23.490> you're<00:01:23.610> running<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.909> fast<00:01:24.119> break

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
shoe when you're running a fast break

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.120 
shoe when you're running a fast break
and<00:01:24.450> when<00:01:24.689> you're<00:01:24.840> trying<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.080> get<00:01:25.229> up<00:01:25.350> on<00:01:25.979> the

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
and when you're trying to get up on the

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.890 
and when you're trying to get up on the
boards<00:01:26.310> you're<00:01:26.970> not<00:01:27.119> gonna<00:01:27.270> feel<00:01:27.479> these<00:01:27.659> weigh

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
boards you're not gonna feel these weigh

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.410 
boards you're not gonna feel these weigh
you<00:01:27.960> down<00:01:28.080> in<00:01:28.680> any<00:01:29.070> sort<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.430> way<00:01:29.490> at<00:01:29.880> least<00:01:30.119> for

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
you down in any sort of way at least for

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.770 
you down in any sort of way at least for
me<00:01:30.509> so<00:01:31.490> the<00:01:32.490> weight<00:01:32.700> definitely<00:01:33.240> gets<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.630> good

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
me so the weight definitely gets a good

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.660 
me so the weight definitely gets a good
grade<00:01:33.960> for<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.200> traction<00:01:35.100> is<00:01:35.430> also

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
grade for that traction is also

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.219 
grade for that traction is also
excellent<00:01:36.000> i<00:01:36.180> was<00:01:36.299> playing<00:01:36.540> an<00:01:36.659> indoor<00:01:36.990> game

and I did not have a problem with the
traction<00:02:01.710> now<00:02:02.340> support<00:02:02.820> is<00:02:03.000> where<00:02:03.509> for<00:02:03.840> me<00:02:03.930> a

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
traction now support is where for me a

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.470 
traction now support is where for me a
little<00:02:04.200> bit<00:02:04.350> of<00:02:04.469> problems<00:02:04.950> arose<00:02:05.810> and

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:07.480 
little bit of problems arose and

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.430 
little bit of problems arose and
that<00:02:07.920> as<00:02:08.920> you<00:02:09.130> can<00:02:09.250> see<00:02:09.460> in<00:02:09.580> a<00:02:09.670> shoe<00:02:10.080> just<00:02:11.080> has<00:02:11.260> a

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
that as you can see in a shoe just has a

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.810 
that as you can see in a shoe just has a
cutout<00:02:12.420> so<00:02:13.420> up<00:02:13.960> here<00:02:14.400> towards<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:15.460> front<00:02:15.730> of

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
cutout so up here towards the front of

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.810 
cutout so up here towards the front of
the<00:02:15.970> ankle<00:02:16.330> you<00:02:16.930> have<00:02:17.080> a<00:02:17.110> lot<00:02:17.380> of<00:02:17.410> support<00:02:17.920> lock

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
the ankle you have a lot of support lock

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.510 
the ankle you have a lot of support lock
down<00:02:19.030> with<00:02:19.240> laces<00:02:19.750> but<00:02:20.200> then<00:02:20.350> in<00:02:20.440> the<00:02:20.500> back<00:02:20.740> you

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
down with laces but then in the back you

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.410 
down with laces but then in the back you
have<00:02:21.760> all<00:02:22.390> this<00:02:22.630> empty<00:02:22.960> space<00:02:23.080> where<00:02:24.070> I<00:02:24.790> would

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
have all this empty space where I would

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.930 
have all this empty space where I would
assume<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:25.990> idea<00:02:26.350> was<00:02:26.650> that<00:02:26.680> it<00:02:27.490> would<00:02:27.670> allow

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
assume the idea was that it would allow

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:34.920 
assume the idea was that it would allow
for<00:02:28.240> a<00:02:28.870> lot<00:02:29.140> of<00:02:29.320> movement<00:02:29.920> and<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:34.060> ankle

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
for a lot of movement and the ankle

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.130 
for a lot of movement and the ankle
support<00:02:36.030> it's<00:02:37.030> not<00:02:37.240> there<00:02:37.540> like<00:02:37.720> I<00:02:37.810> thought<00:02:38.020> it

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
support it's not there like I thought it

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.530 
support it's not there like I thought it
would<00:02:38.230> be<00:02:38.380> should<00:02:39.070> be<00:02:39.220> so<00:02:39.580> what<00:02:40.450> actually

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
would be should be so what actually

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.270 
would be should be so what actually
happened<00:02:40.960> was<00:02:40.990> towards<00:02:41.650> it<00:02:41.770> i<00:02:41.890> was<00:02:42.010> gonna<00:02:42.070> go

is<00:05:11.180> decent<00:05:12.180> but<00:05:12.330> what<00:05:13.140> I<00:05:13.169> was<00:05:13.380> saying<00:05:13.620> is<00:05:13.740> that

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
is decent but what I was saying is that

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.170 
is decent but what I was saying is that
if<00:05:14.040> you<00:05:14.160> have<00:05:14.190> a<00:05:14.400> little<00:05:14.610> extra<00:05:14.790> spending

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
if you have a little extra spending

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.409 
if you have a little extra spending
money<00:05:15.360> if<00:05:16.230> you<00:05:16.470> want<00:05:16.680> to<00:05:16.770> go<00:05:16.860> cheaper<00:05:17.419> these

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
money if you want to go cheaper these

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:20.570 
money if you want to go cheaper these
were<00:05:18.570> a<00:05:18.600> hundred<00:05:18.840> dollars<00:05:19.350> box<00:05:19.950> pricing<00:05:20.430> and

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
were a hundred dollars box pricing and

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.430 
were a hundred dollars box pricing and
if<00:05:21.060> that's<00:05:21.270> your<00:05:21.479> max<00:05:21.720> spending<00:05:22.080> limit<00:05:22.320> I

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
if that's your max spending limit I

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.080 
if that's your max spending limit I
think<00:05:22.680> these<00:05:22.860> are<00:05:22.919> great<00:05:23.400> pair<00:05:23.640> of<00:05:23.729> shoes<00:05:23.910> to

think these are great pair of shoes to
go<00:05:24.240> with<00:05:24.270> but<00:05:25.229> if<00:05:25.500> you<00:05:25.620> have<00:05:25.740> a<00:05:25.770> little<00:05:26.010> extra

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190
