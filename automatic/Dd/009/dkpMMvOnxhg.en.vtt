00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.850 
think i've uploaded three commentaries
already<00:00:08.970> on<00:00:09.120> this<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.599> same<00:00:09.870> map<00:00:10.110> booth<00:00:10.469> this

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
already on this the same map booth this

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.100 
already on this the same map booth this
map<00:00:11.040> is<00:00:11.070> overflow<00:00:11.969> or<00:00:12.000> overturn<00:00:12.690> one<00:00:12.929> of<00:00:13.019> those

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
map is overflow or overturn one of those

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.959 
map is overflow or overturn one of those
two<00:00:13.380> I<00:00:13.559> don't<00:00:14.009> think<00:00:14.160> I<00:00:14.190> can't<00:00:14.610> seem<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:14.880> get

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
two I don't think I can't seem to get

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.060 
two I don't think I can't seem to get
the<00:00:15.089> name<00:00:15.269> exactly<00:00:16.020> writing<00:00:16.350> in<00:00:16.560> my<00:00:16.770> videos

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
the name exactly writing in my videos

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.200 
the name exactly writing in my videos
but<00:00:17.220> I<00:00:17.279> think<00:00:17.550> it's<00:00:17.640> one<00:00:17.789> of<00:00:17.880> them<00:00:17.970> I<00:00:18.029> think<00:00:18.060> I

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
but I think it's one of them I think I

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.060 
but I think it's one of them I think I
might<00:00:18.359> have<00:00:18.390> called<00:00:18.570> it<00:00:18.720> by<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:19.830> wrong<00:00:20.039> name

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
might have called it by the wrong name

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.310 
might have called it by the wrong name
in<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.580> last<00:00:20.760> video<00:00:20.939> so<00:00:21.539> if<00:00:21.750> someone<00:00:22.109> could

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
in the last video so if someone could

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.220 
in the last video so if someone could
remind<00:00:23.250> me<00:00:23.490> what<00:00:23.670> did<00:00:23.760> it<00:00:23.910> exactly<00:00:24.210> is<00:00:24.900> even

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
remind me what did it exactly is even

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.630 
remind me what did it exactly is even
though<00:00:25.320> I've<00:00:25.410> played<00:00:25.619> it<00:00:25.740> so<00:00:25.920> many<00:00:26.039> times<00:00:26.130> I

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
though I've played it so many times I

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.630 
though I've played it so many times I
just<00:00:26.939> can't<00:00:27.330> seem<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.779> put<00:00:28.199> my<00:00:28.230> finger<00:00:28.380> on<00:00:28.680> what

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
just can't seem to put my finger on what

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.030 
just can't seem to put my finger on what
the<00:00:29.789> exact<00:00:30.240> phrasing<00:00:30.990> of<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.140> words<00:00:31.470> are<00:00:31.740> that

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
the exact phrasing of the words are that

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.160 
the exact phrasing of the words are that
this<00:00:32.279> man<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:32.520> called<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.360> that<00:00:33.809> was<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:33.960> really

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
this man is called and that was a really

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.410 
this man is called and that was a really
weird<00:00:34.380> way<00:00:34.680> of<00:00:34.710> saying<00:00:35.160> what<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.910> what<00:00:36.329> is

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
weird way of saying what the what is

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.380 
weird way of saying what the what is
this<00:00:36.570> map<00:00:36.780> called<00:00:37.820> but<00:00:38.820> anyways<00:00:39.149> this

got on a good team fortunately that the

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.569 
got on a good team fortunately that the
other<00:00:49.350> team<00:00:49.590> was<00:00:49.710> actually<00:00:50.070> pretty<00:00:50.309> bad

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
other team was actually pretty bad

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.520 
other team was actually pretty bad
you're<00:00:50.820> gonna<00:00:50.879> see<00:00:51.750> that<00:00:51.899> with<00:00:52.050> end<00:00:52.230> score

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.119 
you're gonna see that with end score
line<00:00:52.680> of<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:52.829> game<00:00:52.980> which<00:00:53.160> was<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.340> lead<00:00:53.789> like

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
line of the game which was a lead like

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.400 
line of the game which was a lead like
229<00:00:56.180> my<00:00:57.180> team<00:00:57.390> actually<00:00:57.570> think<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:58.079> think<00:00:58.320> we

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
229 my team actually think I think we

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.470 
229 my team actually think I think we
triple<00:00:58.770> capped<00:00:58.949> him<00:00:59.160> for<00:00:59.430> pretty<00:01:00.329> much<00:01:00.390> the

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
triple capped him for pretty much the

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.270 
triple capped him for pretty much the
majority<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:01.230> this<00:01:01.440> first<00:01:01.680> round<00:01:01.980> because

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
majority of this first round because

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.460 
majority of this first round because
after<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.760> first<00:01:03.000> round<00:01:03.210> was<00:01:03.870> over<00:01:04.170> I<00:01:04.199> think

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
after the first round was over I think

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.550 
after the first round was over I think
this<00:01:04.979> final<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.720> finals<00:01:07.080> or<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.409> game

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
this final that the finals or the game

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.030 
this final that the finals or the game
score<00:01:07.890> was<00:01:08.570> 152<00:01:09.570> like<00:01:09.840> 20<00:01:10.320> or<00:01:10.470> something<00:01:10.860> goes

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
score was 152 like 20 or something goes

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.609 
score was 152 like 20 or something goes
yeah<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:11.850> was<00:01:12.000> pretty<00:01:12.240> pretty<00:01:12.810> ridiculous<00:01:13.380> and

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
yeah I was pretty pretty ridiculous and

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.890 
yeah I was pretty pretty ridiculous and
the<00:01:14.369> game<00:01:14.520> actually<00:01:14.700> only<00:01:15.000> then<00:01:15.390> lasted<00:01:15.840> I

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
the game actually only then lasted I

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.530 
the game actually only then lasted I
think<00:01:15.930> like<00:01:16.259> six<00:01:16.470> and<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.710> half<00:01:16.740> minutes<00:01:17.100> then

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
think like six and a half minutes then

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.210 
think like six and a half minutes then
so<00:01:18.540> pretty<00:01:18.900> sure<00:01:19.080> game<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:19.650> went<00:01:19.830> whatever

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
so pretty sure game and I went whatever

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.410 
so pretty sure game and I went whatever
88<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:20.909> one<00:01:21.180> with<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.420> 69<00:01:22.130> 69<00:01:23.130> in<00:01:23.400> no<00:01:23.520> start<00:01:23.820> so

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
88 and one with a 69 69 in no start so

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.630 
88 and one with a 69 69 in no start so
they<00:01:25.290> have<00:01:25.409> pretty<00:01:25.680> good<00:01:25.860> stuff<00:01:26.040> especially

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
they have pretty good stuff especially

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.940 
they have pretty good stuff especially
for<00:01:27.000> only<00:01:27.119> being<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.689> guess<00:01:28.020> six<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.920> half

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
for only being I guess six and a half

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.410 
for only being I guess six and a half
minutes<00:01:29.220> long<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.790> wish<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.000> would<00:01:30.090> have<00:01:30.210> lasted

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
minutes long I wish it would have lasted

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.630 
minutes long I wish it would have lasted
pretty<00:01:31.320> much<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.650> full<00:01:31.829> 10<00:01:32.070> hits<00:01:32.340> then<00:01:32.610> I

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
pretty much the full 10 hits then I

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.490 
pretty much the full 10 hits then I
could<00:01:32.850> have<00:01:32.909> gotten<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.420> bunch<00:01:33.930> more<00:01:34.229> kills

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
could have gotten a bunch more kills

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.630 
could have gotten a bunch more kills
because<00:01:34.710> i<00:01:34.860> think<00:01:34.920> i<00:01:35.070> had<00:01:35.220> my<00:01:35.369> killstreaks

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
because i think i had my killstreaks

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.429 
because i think i had my killstreaks

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
about to come up and all that all that

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.280 
about to come up and all that all that
good<00:01:38.159> stuff<00:01:38.189> what<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.390> know<00:01:39.600> what<00:01:39.990> I'm<00:01:40.049> gonna<00:01:40.140> do

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
good stuff what I know what I'm gonna do

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.569 
good stuff what I know what I'm gonna do
is<00:01:40.320> still<00:01:40.829> pretty<00:01:40.979> good<00:01:41.220> uh<00:01:42.860> but<00:01:43.860> yes<00:01:44.159> using

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
is still pretty good uh but yes using

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.370 
is still pretty good uh but yes using
the<00:01:44.670> same<00:01:44.909> setup<00:01:45.240> as<00:01:45.479> I<00:01:45.659> was<00:01:45.840> in<00:01:46.020> my<00:01:46.140> last

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
the same setup as I was in my last

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.319 
the same setup as I was in my last
videos<00:01:46.770> msmc<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.520> know<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.850> should<00:01:48.000> probably

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
videos msmc I know it should probably

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.990 
videos msmc I know it should probably
get<00:01:48.450> some<00:01:49.320> other<00:01:49.530> game<00:01:50.280> plays<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:50.670> guess<00:01:50.850> with

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
get some other game plays I guess with

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.429 
get some other game plays I guess with
other<00:01:51.149> guns<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.750> I'm<00:01:51.810> trying<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.140> do<00:01:52.229> that<00:01:52.380> i

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
other guns and I'm trying to do that i

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.109 
other guns and I'm trying to do that i
have<00:01:52.649> been<00:01:52.860> using<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.549> mp7<00:01:54.770> and<00:01:55.770> 25<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.909> the

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
have been using the mp7 and 25 and the

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.969 
have been using the mp7 and 25 and the
Scorpion<00:01:57.630> but<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.200> just<00:01:58.380> haven't<00:01:58.590> seemed<00:01:58.860> to

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
Scorpion but I just haven't seemed to

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.620 
Scorpion but I just haven't seemed to
been<00:01:59.100> able<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.460> match<00:01:59.729> any<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.240> games<00:02:00.509> that

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
been able to match any of the games that

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.990 
been able to match any of the games that
I've<00:02:00.780> gotten<00:02:01.079> with<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.399> MSMC<00:02:02.399> so<00:02:02.729> maybe<00:02:02.909> I

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
I've gotten with the MSMC so maybe I

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.510 
I've gotten with the MSMC so maybe I
should<00:02:03.180> just<00:02:03.210> use<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.659> MSMC<00:02:04.520> exclusively

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
should just use the MSMC exclusively

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.999 
should just use the MSMC exclusively
until<00:02:05.759> I<00:02:06.000> guess<00:02:06.329> it<00:02:06.630> gets<00:02:06.840> really<00:02:07.110> really

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
until I guess it gets really really

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.699 
until I guess it gets really really
repetitive<00:02:08.660> because<00:02:09.660> I'm<00:02:09.959> really<00:02:10.319> I'm<00:02:10.470> doing

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
repetitive because I'm really I'm doing

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.530 
repetitive because I'm really I'm doing
really<00:02:11.009> well<00:02:11.280> msmc<00:02:11.970> I<00:02:12.150> don't<00:02:12.360> know<00:02:12.420> it<00:02:12.510> just

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
really well msmc I don't know it just

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
really well msmc I don't know it just
seems<00:02:12.840> to<00:02:12.930> be<00:02:12.989> my

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
seems to be my

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.320 
seems to be my
my<00:02:13.890> favorite<00:02:14.280> game<00:02:14.400> personally<00:02:14.970> I<00:02:15.000> know<00:02:15.120> a<00:02:15.180> lot

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
my favorite game personally I know a lot

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.630 
my favorite game personally I know a lot
of<00:02:15.390> people<00:02:15.480> like<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:15.989> mp7<00:02:16.319> but<00:02:17.280> for<00:02:17.489> whatever

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
of people like the mp7 but for whatever

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.850 
of people like the mp7 but for whatever
reason<00:02:17.819> I<00:02:18.270> don't<00:02:18.420> know<00:02:18.540> MSMC<00:02:19.200> I<00:02:19.230> just<00:02:19.560> like<00:02:19.680> the

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
reason I don't know MSMC I just like the

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.190 
reason I don't know MSMC I just like the
recoil<00:02:20.220> on<00:02:20.459> it<00:02:20.610> I'm<00:02:21.510> not<00:02:21.690> oh<00:02:21.720> no<00:02:21.870> sometimes

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
recoil on it I'm not oh no sometimes

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.290 
recoil on it I'm not oh no sometimes
with<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.590> mp7<00:02:22.890> you<00:02:23.250> have<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:23.489> burst<00:02:23.760> fire<00:02:24.000> it<00:02:24.209> a

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
with the mp7 you have to burst fire it a

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.400 
with the mp7 you have to burst fire it a
little<00:02:24.450> bit<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:24.840> you<00:02:24.930> have<00:02:25.020> to<00:02:25.080> be<00:02:25.200> kind<00:02:25.319> of

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
little bit and you have to be kind of

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.600 
little bit and you have to be kind of
careful<00:02:25.590> because<00:02:25.950> if<00:02:26.099> you<00:02:26.250> just<00:02:26.400> hold<00:02:26.489> down

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
careful because if you just hold down

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.940 
careful because if you just hold down
our<00:02:26.970> one<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:27.810> don't<00:02:28.110> do<00:02:28.290> anything<00:02:28.319> either

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
our one and don't do anything either

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.100 
our one and don't do anything either
with<00:02:29.160> your<00:02:29.310> right<00:02:29.489> right<00:02:30.180> analog<00:02:30.660> stick<00:02:30.690> or

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
with your right right analog stick or

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.320 
with your right right analog stick or
whatever<00:02:31.319> or<00:02:31.680> burst<00:02:32.220> fire<00:02:32.430> at<00:02:32.580> all<00:02:32.700> it<00:02:32.849> can<00:02:33.000> the

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
whatever or burst fire at all it can the

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.380 
whatever or burst fire at all it can the
recoil<00:02:33.690> can<00:02:33.930> kind<00:02:34.110> of<00:02:34.170> get<00:02:34.319> away<00:02:34.349> from<00:02:34.560> you<00:02:35.390> but

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
recoil can kind of get away from you but

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.320 
recoil can kind of get away from you but
yeah<00:02:36.599> so<00:02:37.260> I'll<00:02:37.830> definitely<00:02:38.160> try<00:02:38.430> to<00:02:38.519> get<00:02:39.090> some

pretty good game place and they were

different<00:04:07.950> videos<00:04:08.310> and<00:04:08.489> uploaded<00:04:08.910> on<00:04:09.090> the

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
different videos and uploaded on the

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.300 
different videos and uploaded on the
same<00:04:09.690> day<00:04:09.720> like<00:04:10.170> whatever<00:04:10.620> 12<00:04:10.950> or<00:04:11.130> so<00:04:11.280> hours

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
same day like whatever 12 or so hours

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.960 
same day like whatever 12 or so hours
apart<00:04:11.910> I<00:04:12.060> could<00:04:12.209> do<00:04:12.299> that<00:04:12.329> as<00:04:12.600> well<00:04:12.630> or<00:04:13.609> I<00:04:14.609> could

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.000 
apart I could do that as well or I could
upload<00:04:15.540> them<00:04:15.750> I<00:04:15.989> guess<00:04:16.229> Stepp<00:04:16.500> like<00:04:16.739> split

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
upload them I guess Stepp like split

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.890 
upload them I guess Stepp like split
them<00:04:17.160> apart<00:04:17.250> between<00:04:17.669> videos<00:04:18.239> because<00:04:18.570> it<00:04:18.690> is

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
them apart between videos because it is
