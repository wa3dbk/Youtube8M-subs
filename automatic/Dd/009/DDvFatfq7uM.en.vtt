is everybody knows I Apple packaging is

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.439 
is everybody knows I Apple packaging is
beautiful<00:00:49.879> but<00:00:50.879> one<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.180> things<00:00:51.210> they

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
beautiful but one of the things they

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.750 
beautiful but one of the things they
wanted<00:00:51.809> was<00:00:53.329> for<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.660> have<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.410> section<00:00:56.039> as

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
wanted was for it to have a section as

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.099 
wanted was for it to have a section as
it<00:00:56.940> comes<00:00:57.210> out<00:00:57.360> have<00:00:57.660> a<00:00:57.690> sort<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:57.989> a

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
it comes out have a sort of a

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.180 
it comes out have a sort of a
spring-loaded<00:00:58.940> release<00:01:00.770> and<00:01:01.770> I<00:01:01.859> think<00:01:01.920> that's

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
spring-loaded release and I think that's

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.470 
spring-loaded release and I think that's
interesting<00:01:02.670> they<00:01:02.850> would<00:01:02.969> spend<00:01:03.059> that<00:01:03.329> much

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
interesting they would spend that much

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.420 
interesting they would spend that much
time<00:01:03.510> trying<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.049> come<00:01:04.140> up<00:01:04.199> with<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.589> so

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
time trying to come up with that so

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.179 
time trying to come up with that so
there<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:05.939> got<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.240> white<00:01:06.420> version<00:01:06.689> I

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
changes that we get of course is this

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.979 
changes that we get of course is this
new<00:02:05.280> lightning<00:02:05.670> adapter<00:02:06.439> it's<00:02:07.439> a<00:02:07.619> very<00:02:08.009> small

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
new lightning adapter it's a very small

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.300 
new lightning adapter it's a very small
incredibly<00:02:09.989> small<00:02:10.229> compared<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.830> old<00:02:11.069> one

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
incredibly small compared to the old one

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.490 
incredibly small compared to the old one
as<00:02:13.060> you<00:02:13.209> can<00:02:13.300> see<00:02:13.510> as<00:02:13.599> you<00:02:13.720> put<00:02:13.870> them<00:02:14.020> together

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
as you can see as you put them together

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.710 
as you can see as you put them together
I<00:02:15.040> think<00:02:15.670> in<00:02:15.730> the<00:02:15.819> long<00:02:15.970> run<00:02:16.030> this<00:02:16.360> is<00:02:16.420> going<00:02:16.660> to

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
I think in the long run this is going to

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.260 
I think in the long run this is going to
be<00:02:16.840> a<00:02:16.870> good<00:02:17.050> thing<00:02:17.230> for<00:02:17.290> Apple<00:02:17.800> and<00:02:17.920> for<00:02:18.640> users

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
be a good thing for Apple and for users

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.210 
be a good thing for Apple and for users
however<00:02:19.720> in<00:02:19.810> the<00:02:19.870> short<00:02:20.140> run<00:02:20.200> it's<00:02:20.920> a<00:02:21.040> real

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
however in the short run it's a real

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.080 
however in the short run it's a real
pain<00:02:21.459> it<00:02:22.209> means<00:02:22.450> that<00:02:23.610> devices<00:02:24.610> that<00:02:24.730> you<00:02:24.880> have

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
pain it means that devices that you have

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.530 
pain it means that devices that you have
that<00:02:25.360> are<00:02:25.980> designed<00:02:26.980> just<00:02:27.250> for<00:02:27.430> this<00:02:28.330> old

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
that are designed just for this old

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.320 
that are designed just for this old
connector<00:02:29.110> are<00:02:30.040> no<00:02:30.250> longer<00:02:30.489> going<00:02:30.790> to<00:02:31.239> be

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
connector are no longer going to be

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:32.490 
connector are no longer going to be
useful<00:02:31.780> or<00:02:31.900> you're<00:02:32.050> going<00:02:32.170> to<00:02:32.230> have<00:02:32.319> to<00:02:32.380> have

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
useful or you're going to have to have

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:39.600 
useful or you're going to have to have
an<00:02:32.650> adapter<00:02:33.209> for<00:02:34.209> it<00:02:37.980> just<00:02:38.980> slides<00:02:39.220> right<00:02:39.370> in

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
an adapter for it just slides right in

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.050 
an adapter for it just slides right in
much<00:02:39.849> easier<00:02:40.239> to<00:02:40.330> connect<00:02:40.690> then<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.890> old<00:02:42.790> dock

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
much easier to connect then the old dock

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.330
