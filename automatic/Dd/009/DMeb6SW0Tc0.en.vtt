is<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.350> living<00:01:07.740> proof<00:01:08.160> that<00:01:08.220> we<00:01:08.580> all<00:01:08.700> have

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
is a living proof that we all have

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.700 
is a living proof that we all have
different<00:01:09.420> things<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.750> deal<00:01:10.020> with<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:10.620> don't

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710

much<00:01:25.840> I've<00:01:26.229> had<00:01:26.440> enough<00:01:26.770> and<00:01:27.100> this<00:01:27.970> garden<00:01:28.390> has

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
much I've had enough and this garden has

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.540 
much I've had enough and this garden has
flooded<00:01:28.810> like<00:01:29.110> this<00:01:29.380> I<00:01:29.619> think<00:01:29.710> seven<00:01:30.340> or<00:01:30.400> eight

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550

flooded like this I think seven or eight
times<00:01:30.580> and<00:01:31.150> each<00:01:31.270> time<00:01:31.300> I<00:01:32.020> thought<00:01:32.710> for<00:01:32.979> sure

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010 
times and each time I thought for sure

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.649 
times and each time I thought for sure
that<00:01:33.190> that<00:01:33.550> was<00:01:33.850> going<00:01:34.030> to<00:01:34.090> be<00:01:34.180> the<00:01:34.330> end<00:01:34.450> of<00:01:34.540> the

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
that that was going to be the end of the

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:36.780 
that that was going to be the end of the
plant<00:01:34.930> they<00:01:35.530> just<00:01:35.740> wouldn't<00:01:36.070> be<00:01:36.190> able<00:01:36.310> to<00:01:36.550> take

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.780 
plant they just wouldn't be able to take
another<00:01:37.060> drop<00:01:37.750> but<00:01:38.650> they<00:01:38.920> always<00:01:39.160> have

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
another drop but they always have

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.640 
another drop but they always have
bounced<00:01:40.030> back<00:01:40.240> and<00:01:40.600> come<00:01:40.810> through<00:01:40.840> but<00:01:41.440> it's

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
bounced back and come through but it's

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.680 
bounced back and come through but it's
down<00:01:41.950> to<00:01:42.190> it<00:01:42.280> affected<00:01:42.790> my<00:01:43.030> harvest<00:01:43.479> so<00:01:44.350> Oh

here they are
I<00:01:57.580> got<00:01:57.820> thirteen<00:01:58.300> and<00:01:58.420> a<00:01:58.509> half<00:01:58.539> pounds<00:01:59.320> of

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
I got thirteen and a half pounds of

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.310 
I got thirteen and a half pounds of
turnips<00:02:00.030> I<00:02:01.030> used<00:02:01.539> to<00:02:01.660> grow<00:02:01.810> these<00:02:02.020> from<00:02:02.229> my

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
turnips I used to grow these from my

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.560 
turnips I used to grow these from my
grandmother<00:02:02.830> because<00:02:03.100> she<00:02:03.580> liked<00:02:03.880> them<00:02:04.149> and<00:02:04.450> I

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
grandmother because she liked them and I

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.570 
grandmother because she liked them and I
have<00:02:04.750> a<00:02:04.780> feeling<00:02:05.110> that<00:02:05.560> she<00:02:05.890> acquired<00:02:06.130> a<00:02:06.369> taste

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
have a feeling that she acquired a taste

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:09.259 
have a feeling that she acquired a taste
for<00:02:06.789> these<00:02:07.060> things<00:02:07.479> during<00:02:07.899> the<00:02:08.019> Depression<00:02:08.649> I

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:09.269 
for these things during the Depression I

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:12.390 
for these things during the Depression I
think<00:02:10.269> that<00:02:10.570> turnips<00:02:11.080> have<00:02:11.290> gotten<00:02:11.650> a<00:02:11.769> lot<00:02:12.130> of

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
think that turnips have gotten a lot of

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.949 
think that turnips have gotten a lot of
desperate<00:02:12.880> people<00:02:13.030> through<00:02:13.540> a<00:02:13.570> lot<00:02:13.810> of

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
desperate people through a lot of

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:15.750 
desperate people through a lot of

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
greens and the roots and it's been so

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.440 
greens and the roots and it's been so
long<00:02:20.530> since<00:02:20.560> I<00:02:20.920> grew<00:02:21.190> these<00:02:21.400> for<00:02:21.700> her<00:02:21.850> I<00:02:21.880> really

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
long since I grew these for her I really

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.500 
long since I grew these for her I really
didn't<00:02:22.930> remember<00:02:23.700> just<00:02:24.700> how<00:02:24.820> much<00:02:24.940> space<00:02:25.269> they

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
didn't remember just how much space they

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.080 
didn't remember just how much space they
took<00:02:25.750> up<00:02:26.049> or<00:02:26.590> how<00:02:26.829> much<00:02:27.040> you<00:02:27.340> got<00:02:27.549> from<00:02:27.880> them

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
took up or how much you got from them

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.270 
took up or how much you got from them
but<00:02:28.209> as<00:02:28.420> you<00:02:28.600> can<00:02:28.720> see<00:02:28.780> you<00:02:29.200> can<00:02:29.350> get<00:02:29.530> a<00:02:29.590> lot<00:02:30.010> of

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
but as you can see you can get a lot of

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.060 
but as you can see you can get a lot of
food<00:02:30.940> from<00:02:31.299> a<00:02:31.450> very<00:02:31.720> little<00:02:32.440> space<00:02:32.769> with

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
food from a very little space with

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.300 
food from a very little space with
turnips<00:02:33.519> and<00:02:33.810> I<00:02:34.810> didn't<00:02:35.140> grow<00:02:35.320> these<00:02:35.590> as<00:02:35.980> well

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
turnips and I didn't grow these as well

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.370 
turnips and I didn't grow these as well
as<00:02:36.640> I<00:02:36.760> should<00:02:36.790> have

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
as I should have

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.960 
as I should have
when<00:02:38.380> I<00:02:38.410> first<00:02:38.620> planted<00:02:39.130> them<00:02:39.340> my<00:02:39.610> chickens

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
when I first planted them my chickens

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.880 
when I first planted them my chickens
got<00:02:40.150> into<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:40.540> bed<00:02:40.750> and<00:02:40.989> they<00:02:41.320> scratched<00:02:41.680> it

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
got into the bed and they scratched it

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.620 
got into the bed and they scratched it
all<00:02:41.980> up<00:02:42.010> and<00:02:42.400> made<00:02:42.549> a<00:02:42.610> big<00:02:42.760> mess<00:02:42.970> of<00:02:43.269> it<00:02:43.450> and

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
all up and made a big mess of it and

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.080 
all up and made a big mess of it and
then<00:02:43.780> I<00:02:43.959> never<00:02:44.170> did<00:02:44.380> get<00:02:44.560> around<00:02:44.680> to<00:02:45.090> thinning

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
then I never did get around to thinning

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.340 
then I never did get around to thinning
them<00:02:46.269> out<00:02:46.480> and<00:02:46.690> they<00:02:46.750> should<00:02:46.930> be<00:02:47.049> thin<00:02:47.320> to

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
them out and they should be thin to

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.560 
them out and they should be thin to
three<00:02:48.220> to<00:02:48.340> four<00:02:48.370> inches<00:02:48.880> apart

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
three to four inches apart

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.720 
three to four inches apart
they<00:02:50.079> should<00:02:50.320> be<00:02:50.440> harvested<00:02:51.040> when<00:02:51.280> they're

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
they should be harvested when they're

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.910 
they should be harvested when they're
about<00:02:52.180> 2<00:02:52.450> to<00:02:52.570> 3<00:02:52.780> inches<00:02:53.019> in<00:02:53.200> diameter

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
about 2 to 3 inches in diameter

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.520 
about 2 to 3 inches in diameter
if<00:02:54.310> you<00:02:54.910> pull<00:02:55.690> them<00:02:55.900> when<00:02:56.110> they're<00:02:56.290> small

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
if you pull them when they're small

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.199 
if you pull them when they're small
they're<00:02:57.070> hot<00:02:57.340> they're<00:02:57.370> kind<00:02:57.790> of<00:02:57.880> a<00:02:57.970> cross

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
they're hot they're kind of a cross

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.210 
they're hot they're kind of a cross
between<00:02:58.450> a<00:02:58.720> radish<00:02:59.320> and<00:02:59.500> a<00:02:59.560> cabbage<00:03:00.040> and

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
between a radish and a cabbage and

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.430 
between a radish and a cabbage and
they're<00:03:01.090> hot<00:03:01.299> when<00:03:01.510> they're<00:03:01.660> small<00:03:01.989> and<00:03:02.320> then

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
they're hot when they're small and then

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.490 
they're hot when they're small and then
as<00:03:02.680> they<00:03:02.890> get<00:03:03.519> bigger<00:03:03.850> then<00:03:04.630> they<00:03:04.989> lose<00:03:05.230> some

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
as they get bigger then they lose some

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.170 
as they get bigger then they lose some
of<00:03:05.530> the<00:03:05.709> heat<00:03:05.980> and<00:03:06.220> if<00:03:06.610> they're<00:03:06.790> hit<00:03:06.970> by<00:03:07.150> a

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
of the heat and if they're hit by a

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.319 
of the heat and if they're hit by a
frost<00:03:07.540> they'll<00:03:07.780> take<00:03:07.989> on<00:03:08.140> some<00:03:08.380> sweetness

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
frost they'll take on some sweetness

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:13.140 
frost they'll take on some sweetness
they<00:03:10.500> I've<00:03:11.500> read<00:03:11.829> that<00:03:12.040> they<00:03:12.160> don't<00:03:12.400> can<00:03:12.760> well

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
they I've read that they don't can well

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.810 
they I've read that they don't can well
but<00:03:13.420> I<00:03:13.450> wanted<00:03:13.810> to<00:03:13.959> can<00:03:14.200> some<00:03:14.590> just<00:03:14.950> to<00:03:15.010> see<00:03:15.280> how

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
but I wanted to can some just to see how

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.699 
but I wanted to can some just to see how
bad<00:03:16.180> they<00:03:16.450> turn<00:03:16.720> out<00:03:16.750> because<00:03:17.109> I<00:03:17.290> don't<00:03:17.530> like

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
bad they turn out because I don't like

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.190 
bad they turn out because I don't like
turnips<00:03:18.250> I'll<00:03:18.459> be<00:03:18.910> honest<00:03:19.180> with<00:03:19.359> you<00:03:19.570> so<00:03:20.049> I<00:03:20.079> can

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
turnips I'll be honest with you so I can

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.940 
turnips I'll be honest with you so I can
sum<00:03:20.829> up<00:03:21.070> and<00:03:21.660> they<00:03:22.660> the<00:03:23.049> flavor<00:03:23.320> seems<00:03:23.769> to

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
sum up and they the flavor seems to

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.819 
sum up and they the flavor seems to
intensify<00:03:24.489> and<00:03:25.000> they<00:03:25.660> ended<00:03:26.049> up<00:03:26.170> a<00:03:26.410> bit<00:03:26.590> on<00:03:26.620> the

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
intensify and they ended up a bit on the

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:28.860 
intensify and they ended up a bit on the
soft<00:03:27.100> side<00:03:27.400> but<00:03:27.730> they<00:03:27.880> are<00:03:28.060> edible<00:03:28.569> I<00:03:28.690> could

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
soft side but they are edible I could

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.240 
soft side but they are edible I could
throw<00:03:29.110> them<00:03:29.319> in<00:03:29.500> with<00:03:29.680> a<00:03:29.709> pot<00:03:29.950> of<00:03:30.069> collard

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
throw them in with a pot of collard

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.729 
throw them in with a pot of collard
greens<00:03:30.700> and<00:03:31.000> eat<00:03:31.720> them<00:03:31.870> just<00:03:31.900> find<00:03:32.319> that<00:03:32.530> way<00:03:32.709> I

greens and eat them just find that way I

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:33.930 
greens and eat them just find that way I
believe

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
believe

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.790

turn ups are a cool weather crop and I

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.680 
turn ups are a cool weather crop and I
believe<00:03:36.010> one<00:03:36.190> of<00:03:36.250> the<00:03:36.310> advantages<00:03:36.820> of<00:03:36.880> them<00:03:37.360> is

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
believe one of the advantages of them is

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:39.120 
believe one of the advantages of them is
that<00:03:37.930> they<00:03:38.080> could<00:03:38.140> stay<00:03:38.410> out<00:03:38.440> in<00:03:38.680> the<00:03:38.740> garden<00:03:39.070> a

that they could stay out in the garden a

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:40.620 
that they could stay out in the garden a
long<00:03:39.340> time<00:03:39.670> and<00:03:39.850> you<00:03:39.910> could<00:03:40.060> just<00:03:40.150> use<00:03:40.390> them<00:03:40.600> as

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
long time and you could just use them as

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.470 
long time and you could just use them as
you<00:03:40.900> needed<00:03:41.140> them<00:03:41.460> they<00:03:42.460> don't<00:03:42.670> store<00:03:43.150> well

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
you needed them they don't store well

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.420 
you needed them they don't store well
they<00:03:43.810> can<00:03:44.020> be<00:03:44.200> stored<00:03:44.410> in<00:03:44.560> a<00:03:44.680> root<00:03:44.860> cellar<00:03:45.130> but
