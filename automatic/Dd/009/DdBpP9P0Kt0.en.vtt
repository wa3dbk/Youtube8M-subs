00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.580
 I was 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.230
 if you give a ball to him so that the 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.399
 Pull with your hand as hard as possible 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.399
 of the strip with the right 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.109
 happens that being left-handed , I already have 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:46.780
 damask a right-handed and the acceleration that 

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:48.670
 It gives you a unique blow but it's more 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.190
 defensive then already terrace always 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.589
 ends top to top 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.869
 obligatorily passes the ball the comb 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:58.030
 let alone give him full on the ball is 

00:00:55.869 --> 00:01:00.369
 to give it a lot of effect 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.649
 the speed is not so high but the 

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:04.360
 who votes on the floor a lot comes out 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:06.280
 say goodbye but the ball is not going 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.710
 so fast because when he hits more 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.530
 the ends later on the ball travels 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.890
 much faster it votes less but it's a 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:17.409
 right of attack over which he votes 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.750
 it shoots out when it hits 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:22.330
 prints many more revolutions to the 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.700
 ball that when it hits him but 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.289
 nothing ahead is going faster 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.429
 because then it does not go so fired towards 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:29.429
 the ball of rafa when you vote 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.140
 in the player 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.470
 and when it attacks healthy and goes lower to 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.979
 see the ideal height is to hit 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.439
 waist to the chest let's say more or less 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:48.820
 whatever it over his shoulder 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:50.920
 lose effort and lose precision 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.960
 then apart that suits you very well 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.380
 very strong the ball has very common 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.600
 like many very heavy 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.829
 contains write you back you lose 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.600
 any kind of initiative 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:03.759
 rafa does not leave you stuck with the 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.229
 right but it's wearing you out to 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.720
 a player like djokovic who is 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.550
 also physically he does not care about that 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.650
 it does not come until I change a 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.970
 the most definitive blow would be that they are 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.200
 talking about doing now that is finishing more 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.200
 ahead recorded the go fast 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.319
 upside down the race key upside down is the 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.350
 right hand to the left 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.190
 practically the company only 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.540
 usually it's going to have to be returned 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:36.400
 hands a right hand in the clear hand and the 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.020
 left-handed has a left-handed like in the hand 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.450
 key is the right one there is to be 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.850
 say that rafa is dexterous mega balls that 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.920
 it is forced that nobody arrives or that if 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.910
 he arrives only at the place he arrives and with his hand 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.830
 right it helps a lot 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.790
 with which then it has more much more 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.670
 power 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.400
 and let's say techniques with the right hand that 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.989
 any disk in your hand malaria or the 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.670
 backwards or before the weakest stroke and the 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.049
 that has less strength but now 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.939
 helping with the right hand generates 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.239
 a force that no one else was 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:06.239
 general
