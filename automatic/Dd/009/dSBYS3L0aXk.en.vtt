00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:12.639
 let's make a mushroom cream 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.060
 for this I have here mushroom and asia 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:18.050
 washes 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:20.030
 salt nutmeg vegetable broth 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:26.230
 It can also be a soft broth 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:28.359
 chicken creme onion leek and garlic 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.849
 once the mushrooms are washed 

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:33.840
 we have cut into sheets we have reserved 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:37.720
 three little ones for the final decoration 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.930
 we have also cut the onion what 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.000
 leek white and garlic cloves and 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:46.600
 We are going to all these vegetables 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.190
 support in the pot where we have put 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.430
 a little of oil 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.850
 we will add salt and we will have it all 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:58.030
 frying softly for about 10 or 15 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.030
 minutes 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.530
 we fry it like that for 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:08.190
 that freezes everything well do not have to 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:11.130
 brown and get toasted, but 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:14.460
 wants simply because critical poaching 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.970
 soft but not golden so that it does not take 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.970
 a dark color 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.590
 I have been referring to the mushrooms 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.110
 with the onion the leek and garlic has 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.510
 released a lot of water first and then you 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:31.750
 the embedded and began to laugh 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.310
 now we are going to add him as I am for 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.880
 other people I will add this 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.880
 tablespoon 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.780
 we fry it to cook 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:53.720
 and now we add the vegetable broth 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.100
 or chicken 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.100
 as we want 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.670
 now let's leave 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:09.970
 do this ten or fifteen minutes more 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.959
 we'll taste salt and then we'll finish 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.959
 and the recipe 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:18.910
 has been cooking for 10 or 15 minutes 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.340
 Now let's crush it with the blender 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.340
 so that it is a finite cream if it is 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.820
 necessary we will even pass it on later 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.820
 a Chinese 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.090
 and more 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:40.340
 we have already crushed the clinic is very 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.950
 fine we have tried it of salt is super 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.670
 great flavor we now take to 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:49.420
 grate a little nutmeg to 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:49.420
 give it a small touch 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.659
 and we would only have to put a bullshit 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.579
 cream 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:04.260
 that is also optional, there will be someone who does not 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:06.480
 want to put leona is simply 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.189
 So it's already great but for that 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.590
 we still believe them and here we go 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:12.590
 to add a bullshit of nothing 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.800
 we cut the mushrooms to decorate 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.739
 in sheets and now in a pan with very 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:34.040
 little hot oil we're going to 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.040
 brown 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:51.840
 we already have all the mushrooms so 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:54.650
 now we remove them to a plastic 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.650
 like you 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.410
 so that it presents a cream reaction 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:07.910
 of mushroom decorated with the 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:12.239
 golden mushrooms and chopped parsley 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:15.330
 it's super cool this for one of 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:18.530
 the Christmas days I can assure you 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.530
 you will be great
