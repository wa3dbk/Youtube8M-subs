western north carolina the leading edge

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.990 
western north carolina the leading edge
is<00:00:09.690> just<00:00:10.260> now<00:00:10.830> entering<00:00:10.860> the<00:00:11.340> North<00:00:11.610> Carolina

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
is just now entering the North Carolina

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.459 
is just now entering the North Carolina
mountains<00:00:12.150> see<00:00:12.480> temperatures<00:00:12.809> are<00:00:13.080> still<00:00:13.320> in

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
mountains see temperatures are still in

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.259 
mountains see temperatures are still in
the<00:00:13.559> 70s<00:00:14.130> out<00:00:14.219> there<00:00:14.400> we've<00:00:14.519> got<00:00:14.549> dewpoints

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
the 70s out there we've got dewpoints

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.450 
the 70s out there we've got dewpoints
almost<00:00:16.139> equal<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.770> air<00:00:16.890> temperature<00:00:17.250> so

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
almost equal to the air temperature so

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.400 
almost equal to the air temperature so
it's<00:00:17.580> a<00:00:17.640> really<00:00:17.940> soupy<00:00:18.480> airmass<00:00:18.840> across<00:00:19.230> the

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
it's a really soupy airmass across the

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.200 
it's a really soupy airmass across the
region<00:00:19.770> so<00:00:19.949> these<00:00:20.070> storms<00:00:20.430> have<00:00:20.490> plenty<00:00:21.119> of

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
region so these storms have plenty of

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.509 
region so these storms have plenty of
fuel<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:22.289> keep<00:00:22.439> them<00:00:22.650> going<00:00:22.920> during<00:00:23.310> the

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
fuel to keep them going during the

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
line that is kind of formed ahead of the

main line this patch near Greenville is

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.200 
main line this patch near Greenville is
actually<00:00:50.129> ahead<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.610> main<00:00:50.760> line<00:00:51.000> which<00:00:51.180> is

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
actually ahead of the main line which is

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.270 
actually ahead of the main line which is
sitting<00:00:51.629> back<00:00:51.840> in<00:00:52.050> this<00:00:52.230> region<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.920> then

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
sitting back in this region and then

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.770 
sitting back in this region and then
when<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:53.460> look<00:00:53.640> back<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.120> west<00:00:54.329> you<00:00:54.539> still

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
when you look back to the west you still

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.990 
when you look back to the west you still
have<00:00:54.930> plenty<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.500> rain<00:00:55.770> which<00:00:56.399> extends<00:00:56.910> all

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
have plenty of rain which extends all

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.869 
have plenty of rain which extends all
the<00:00:57.030> way<00:00:57.149> back<00:00:57.390> into<00:00:57.920> even<00:00:58.920> parts<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.399> Alabama

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
the way back into even parts of Alabama

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.119 
the way back into even parts of Alabama
and<00:01:00.539> that's<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:00.989> think<00:01:01.020> where<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.500> actual<00:01:01.800> cold

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
and that's I think where the actual cold

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.590 
and that's I think where the actual cold
front<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.550> actually<00:01:02.879> setting<00:01:03.270> up<00:01:03.420> this

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
front is actually setting up this

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.899 
front is actually setting up this
morning<00:01:04.080> this<00:01:04.830> is<00:01:05.040> squall<00:01:05.460> line<00:01:05.670> it's<00:01:05.880> going

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
morning this is squall line it's going

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.580 
morning this is squall line it's going
to<00:01:06.090> raced<00:01:06.270> out<00:01:06.450> ahead<00:01:06.540> of<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.810> main<00:01:06.990> line<00:01:07.290> and

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
to raced out ahead of the main line and

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.080 
to raced out ahead of the main line and
if<00:01:07.979> you're<00:01:08.100> looking<00:01:08.369> for<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.610> cold<00:01:08.850> front

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
if you're looking for the cold front

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.020 
if you're looking for the cold front
it's<00:01:09.330> actually<00:01:09.689> right<00:01:10.080> in<00:01:10.110> there<00:01:10.820> moving<00:01:11.820> east

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
it's actually right in there moving east

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.030 
it's actually right in there moving east
of<00:01:12.210> Birmingham<00:01:12.659> towards<00:01:13.020> aniston<00:01:13.619> in<00:01:13.740> areas

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
of Birmingham towards aniston in areas

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.200 
of Birmingham towards aniston in areas
like<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.369> let's<00:01:14.549> go<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.700> little<00:01:14.850> bit<00:01:15.000> closer

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
like that let's go a little bit closer

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.719 
like that let's go a little bit closer
and<00:01:15.540> show<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:16.080> first<00:01:16.799> warm<00:01:17.009> Doppler<00:01:17.400> radar

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
and show you a first warm Doppler radar

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.550 
and show you a first warm Doppler radar
and<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:17.850> can<00:01:18.000> see<00:01:18.180> first<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.900> all<00:01:19.049> look<00:01:19.320> at<00:01:19.470> the

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
and you can see first of all look at the

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.640 
and you can see first of all look at the
amount<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:20.220> lightning<00:01:20.729> we<00:01:20.880> have<00:01:21.590> across<00:01:22.590> the

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
amount of lightning we have across the

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.800 
amount of lightning we have across the
region<00:01:23.250> just<00:01:23.400> in<00:01:23.610> a<00:01:23.700> tremendous<00:01:24.180> amount<00:01:24.720> of

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
region just in a tremendous amount of

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.499 
region just in a tremendous amount of
lightning<00:01:25.259> in<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.430> western<00:01:27.060> part<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.299> state

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
lightning in the western part of state

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:28.609 
lightning in the western part of state
and<00:01:27.600> that's<00:01:27.750> probably<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.200> one<00:01:28.350> thing<00:01:28.530> that's

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
and that's probably the one thing that's

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.050 
and that's probably the one thing that's
going<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.890> wake<00:01:29.159> people<00:01:29.189> up<00:01:29.670> here<00:01:29.909> in<00:01:30.000> the

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
going to wake people up here in the

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.060 
going to wake people up here in the
middle<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.420> night<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.840> all<00:01:31.829> of<00:01:31.950> the

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
middle of the night is all of the
