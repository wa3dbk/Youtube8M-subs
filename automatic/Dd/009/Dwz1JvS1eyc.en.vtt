explain<00:00:32.590> in<00:00:32.739> game<00:00:32.920> so<00:00:33.250> I<00:00:33.519> use<00:00:34.330> the<00:00:35.080> normal<00:00:35.230> WS

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:35.860

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.210 
explain in game so I use the normal WS
Wallace<00:00:36.610> keys<00:00:36.850> and<00:00:37.120> I<00:00:37.750> just<00:00:38.559> switched<00:00:38.769> with<00:00:39.040> e

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.220 
Wallace keys and I just switched with e

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.049 
Wallace keys and I just switched with e
for<00:00:40.120> my<00:00:40.180> next<00:00:40.360> weapon<00:00:41.309> my<00:00:42.309> sensitivity<00:00:42.760> in

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
for my next weapon my sensitivity in

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:45.869 
for my next weapon my sensitivity in
game<00:00:43.239> is<00:00:43.420> at<00:00:43.570> about<00:00:43.660> 2.2<00:00:44.440> so<00:00:44.800> it's<00:00:45.370> rather<00:00:45.580> low

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:45.879 
game is at about 2.2 so it's rather low

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:47.939 
game is at about 2.2 so it's rather low
and<00:00:46.120> then<00:00:46.239> I<00:00:46.360> also<00:00:46.390> have<00:00:46.809> my<00:00:46.839> DPI<00:00:47.410> from<00:00:47.860> my

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:47.949 
and then I also have my DPI from my

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:53.639 
and then I also have my DPI from my
razer<00:00:48.160> mouse<00:00:48.400> at<00:00:51.059> at<00:00:52.059> around<00:00:52.390> seven<00:00:53.379> hundred

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:53.649 
razer mouse at at around seven hundred

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:56.880 
razer mouse at at around seven hundred
DPI<00:00:53.950> so<00:00:54.370> that's<00:00:54.820> also<00:00:55.000> low<00:00:55.329> my<00:00:56.199> you<00:00:56.260> see<00:00:56.649> the

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
DPI so that's also low my you see the

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.529 
DPI so that's also low my you see the
scope<00:00:57.219> when<00:00:57.489> I'm<00:00:57.610> sniping<00:00:58.149> um<00:00:59.940> so<00:01:00.940> that's<00:01:01.329> a

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:01.539 
scope when I'm sniping um so that's a

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:03.389 
scope when I'm sniping um so that's a
lot<00:01:01.930> different<00:01:01.960> than<00:01:02.469> that<00:01:02.530> let's<00:01:03.129> say<00:01:03.250> the

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:03.399 
lot different than that let's say the

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:06.980 
lot different than that let's say the
right<00:01:03.579> trigger<00:01:03.760> or<00:01:04.030> whatever<00:01:04.300> it<00:01:04.479> is<00:01:04.600> um<00:01:05.490> but

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
right trigger or whatever it is um but

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.070 
right trigger or whatever it is um but
shooting<00:01:07.990> just<00:01:08.350> that<00:01:08.560> no<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:10.180> now<00:01:10.300> anyway<00:01:10.869> I'm

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
shooting just that no so now anyway I'm

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.080 
shooting just that no so now anyway I'm
really<00:01:11.350> used<00:01:11.619> to<00:01:11.740> using<00:01:12.039> a<00:01:12.310> headphone<00:01:12.729> so<00:01:12.970> it's

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
really used to using a headphone so it's

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.279 
really used to using a headphone so it's
a<00:01:13.119> lot<00:01:13.270> different<00:01:13.450> when<00:01:13.720> I'm<00:01:13.840> playing<00:01:13.960> up

00:01:14.279 --> 00:01:14.289
