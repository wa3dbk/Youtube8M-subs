uniform with with all over print to me

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.070 
uniform with with all over print to me
it<00:01:04.080> kind<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.320> gives<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.799> hybrid<00:01:05.220> type<00:01:05.670> feel

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
it kind of gives it a hybrid type feel

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.990 
it kind of gives it a hybrid type feel
but<00:01:07.080> honestly<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.619> don't<00:01:07.860> know<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.580> store<00:01:08.820> we

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
but honestly I don't know the store we

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.310 
but honestly I don't know the store we
haven't<00:01:09.240> seen<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.390> press<00:01:09.630> release<00:01:09.810> on<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.140> shoe

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
haven't seen a press release on the shoe

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.990 
haven't seen a press release on the shoe
we<00:01:10.470> don't<00:01:10.619> know<00:01:10.770> the<00:01:10.950> story<00:01:11.100> behind<00:01:11.220> the

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
we don't know the story behind the

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.700 
we don't know the story behind the
design<00:01:12.299> of<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.510> shoe<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:13.020> I<00:01:13.200> think<00:01:13.409> once<00:01:13.619> we

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
design of the shoe and I think once we

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.170 
design of the shoe and I think once we
hear<00:01:13.860> more<00:01:14.100> of<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.340> then<00:01:14.610> we'll<00:01:14.790> kind<00:01:15.030> of

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
hear more of that then we'll kind of

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.570 
hear more of that then we'll kind of
lean<00:01:15.840> one<00:01:16.170> way<00:01:16.200> or<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.619> other<00:01:16.740> obviously<00:01:17.280> the

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
lean one way or the other obviously the

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.999 
lean one way or the other obviously the
the<00:01:18.150> inside<00:01:18.960> collar<00:01:19.320> this<00:01:19.619> thing<00:01:19.770> looks<00:01:19.950> like

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
the inside collar this thing looks like

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.520 
the inside collar this thing looks like
it's<00:01:20.250> it's<00:01:20.460> leather<00:01:20.700> my<00:01:21.600> guess<00:01:21.810> is<00:01:22.110> this<00:01:22.380> is

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
it's it's leather my guess is this is

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.109 
it's it's leather my guess is this is
going<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.710> be<00:01:22.799> an<00:01:22.920> absolute<00:01:23.400> premium<00:01:23.759> product

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
going to be an absolute premium product

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.240 
going to be an absolute premium product
it<00:01:24.509> will<00:01:24.750> be<00:01:24.930> more<00:01:25.170> expensive<00:01:25.530> i'm<00:01:25.860> guessing

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
it will be more expensive i'm guessing

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.780 
it will be more expensive i'm guessing
200<00:01:26.790> plus<00:01:27.030> for<00:01:27.930> these<00:01:28.080> shoes<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:29.250> then<00:01:29.400> what

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
200 plus for these shoes and then what

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:30.890 
200 plus for these shoes and then what
