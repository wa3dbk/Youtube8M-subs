in devastating fashion no England people

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.320 
in devastating fashion no England people
would<00:03:46.780> be<00:03:46.990> you<00:03:47.830> know<00:03:47.950> jumping<00:03:48.370> up<00:03:48.520> at<00:03:48.730> the

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
would be you know jumping up at the

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.330 
would be you know jumping up at the
final<00:03:49.750> to<00:03:49.870> say<00:03:50.020> it<00:03:50.080> was<00:03:50.260> an<00:03:50.350> amazing<00:03:50.560> fight<00:03:51.040> so

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
final to say it was an amazing fight so

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.130 
final to say it was an amazing fight so
that's<00:03:51.850> the<00:03:52.120> way<00:03:52.210> he<00:03:52.420> fights<00:03:52.630> and<00:03:52.900> I<00:03:52.960> think

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
that's the way he fights and I think

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.060 
that's the way he fights and I think
that<00:03:53.320> he's<00:03:53.410> gonna<00:03:53.500> have<00:03:53.620> to<00:03:53.680> make<00:03:53.770> a<00:03:53.830> lot<00:03:54.010> of

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
that he's gonna have to make a lot of

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:55.680 
that he's gonna have to make a lot of
change<00:03:54.370> to<00:03:54.490> be<00:03:54.700> successful<00:03:55.030> in<00:03:55.300> the<00:03:55.420> probes

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
change to be successful in the probes

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.080 
change to be successful in the probes
and<00:03:55.960> if<00:03:56.560> he<00:03:56.650> changes<00:03:57.220> then<00:03:57.430> it<00:03:57.550> changes<00:03:57.940> the

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
and if he changes then it changes the

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.200 
and if he changes then it changes the
spartax<00:03:58.630> and<00:03:58.960> then<00:03:59.200> will<00:03:59.470> you<00:03:59.560> be<00:03:59.740> as<00:04:00.210> elusive

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:01.210 
spartax and then will you be as elusive

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:10.150 
spartax and then will you be as elusive
as<00:04:01.570> he<00:04:01.720> has<00:04:01.990> been<00:04:02.290> in<00:04:02.410> the<00:04:02.500> past
