she's<00:00:34.950> killed

she's killed

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.410 
she's killed
it's<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.420> way<00:00:36.510> we<00:00:36.539> shot<00:00:37.140> this<00:00:37.460> is<00:00:38.460> we<00:00:39.120> had

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
it's the way we shot this is we had

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.260 
it's the way we shot this is we had
Alice<00:00:40.280> performed<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.370> first<00:00:41.579> portion<00:00:42.149> of

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
Alice performed the first portion of

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.600 
Alice performed the first portion of
this<00:00:42.420> where<00:00:42.690> she<00:00:42.870> falls<00:00:43.800> down<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.430> she

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
this where she falls down and she

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.670 
this where she falls down and she
screams<00:00:45.620> and<00:00:46.620> she<00:00:46.890> dies<00:00:48.260> this<00:00:49.260> was<00:00:49.440> filmed

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
screams and she dies this was filmed

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.080 
screams and she dies this was filmed
against<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:49.949> blue<00:00:50.160> screen<00:00:50.780> then<00:00:51.780> we<00:00:53.090> very

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
against a blue screen then we very

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.720 
against a blue screen then we very
carefully<00:00:54.500> matched<00:00:55.500> modeled<00:00:56.129> her<00:00:56.340> so<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:56.609> we

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
carefully matched modeled her so that we

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.119 
carefully matched modeled her so that we
had<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.000> model<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.870> her<00:00:58.019> that<00:00:58.170> was<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.010> right

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
had a model of her that was the right

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.240 
had a model of her that was the right
proportions<00:00:59.730> that<00:01:00.320> was<00:01:01.320> carefully<00:01:01.769> animated

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
proportions that was carefully animated

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.130 
proportions that was carefully animated
to<00:01:02.340> follow<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.789> performance<00:01:03.420> that<00:01:03.480> we<00:01:03.690> shot

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
to follow the performance that we shot

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.620 
to follow the performance that we shot
of<00:01:04.290> Alice<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.739> then<00:01:05.460> from<00:01:05.880> there<00:01:06.000> that<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.330> CG

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
of Alice and then from there that the CG

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.260 
of Alice and then from there that the CG
takes<00:01:06.869> over<00:01:07.259> we<00:01:08.159> mapped<00:01:08.520> her<00:01:08.729> live-action

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
takes over we mapped her live-action

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.469 
takes over we mapped her live-action
performance<00:01:09.869> onto<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.700> CG<00:01:11.700> model<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.150> her<00:01:12.270> and

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
performance onto the CG model of her and

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.719 
performance onto the CG model of her and
then<00:01:12.960> we<00:01:13.080> erode<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.740> skin<00:01:14.040> down<00:01:14.250> we<00:01:14.430> evaporate

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
then we erode the skin down we evaporate

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.440 
then we erode the skin down we evaporate
it<00:01:15.090> down<00:01:15.299> to<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.770> computer<00:01:16.770> modeled<00:01:17.520> skeleton

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
it down to a computer modeled skeleton

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.840 
it down to a computer modeled skeleton
underneath<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.340> as<00:01:20.340> this<00:01:20.549> is<00:01:20.700> happening

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
underneath and as this is happening

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.870 
underneath and as this is happening
there's<00:01:21.270> little<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:22.159> nasty<00:01:23.159> little<00:01:23.280> flakes<00:01:23.700> of

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
there's little of nasty little flakes of

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.399 
there's little of nasty little flakes of
flesh<00:01:24.150> that<00:01:24.180> are<00:01:24.420> all<00:01:24.509> kind<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.810> flying<00:01:25.079> off

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
flesh that are all kind of flying off

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.020 
flesh that are all kind of flying off
and<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:26.340> think<00:01:27.090> that<00:01:27.270> in<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.900> end<00:01:27.930> it's<00:01:28.259> it's

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
and I think that in the end it's it's

00:01:29.030 --> 00:03:10.940 
and I think that in the end it's it's
worked<00:01:30.030> very<00:01:30.270> well<00:01:30.890> it's<00:01:31.890> quite<00:01:32.159> gruesome

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.010 

you
