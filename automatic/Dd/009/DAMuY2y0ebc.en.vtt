00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
somehow so that's it that's pretty much

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.300 
somehow so that's it that's pretty much
the<00:03:12.610> basics

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.490 

so<00:03:18.000> if<00:03:18.090> you<00:03:18.180> have<00:03:18.360> a<00:03:18.720> um<00:03:20.000> your<00:03:21.000> actual<00:03:21.569> shade

foundation then you can use that to

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.180 
foundation then you can use that to
contour<00:03:27.630> your<00:03:27.690> face<00:03:27.780> so<00:03:28.349> just<00:03:28.620> pretty<00:03:28.950> much

max<00:05:00.630> blunt<00:05:01.200> right<00:05:01.470> here<00:05:01.800> um<00:05:02.100> if<00:05:02.970> you<00:05:03.120> have

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:03.210 
max blunt right here um if you have

max blunt right here um if you have
about<00:05:03.389> the<00:05:04.380> same<00:05:04.789> skin<00:05:05.789> color<00:05:05.820> as<00:05:06.270> mine<00:05:06.570> are<00:05:06.930> a

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
little bit darker than I think max blunt

little bit darker than I think max blunt
would<00:05:09.180> work<00:05:09.570> as<00:05:10.440> well<00:05:10.500> or<00:05:11.460> just<00:05:11.690> just<00:05:12.690> an

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
would work as well or just just an

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.529 
would work as well or just just an
eyeshadow<00:05:13.229> is<00:05:13.500> fine<00:05:13.830> but<00:05:14.370> I<00:05:14.610> guess<00:05:14.789> investing

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:15.539 
eyeshadow is fine but I guess investing

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:20.390 
eyeshadow is fine but I guess investing
for<00:05:15.870> a<00:05:16.729> bronzing<00:05:17.729> powder<00:05:17.910> is<00:05:18.389> really<00:05:19.400> it's

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
for a bronzing powder is really it's

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.950 
for a bronzing powder is really it's
really<00:05:20.520> good<00:05:20.820> that<00:05:21.030> thing<00:05:21.479> will<00:05:21.600> make<00:05:21.780> a<00:05:21.810> lot

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
really good that thing will make a lot

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:24.969 
really good that thing will make a lot
of<00:05:21.990> difference<00:05:22.410> if<00:05:22.830> you're<00:05:23.190> really<00:05:23.490> pale<00:05:23.940> I

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:24.979 
of difference if you're really pale I

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:29.089 
of difference if you're really pale I
think<00:05:26.000> this<00:05:27.000> NYX<00:05:27.419> one<00:05:27.960> in<00:05:28.260> chocolate<00:05:28.860> mousse

00:05:29.089 --> 00:05:29.099 
think this NYX one in chocolate mousse

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:30.800 
think this NYX one in chocolate mousse
will<00:05:29.909> also<00:05:30.270> work

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
will also work

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.190 
will also work
out<00:05:30.900> it's<00:05:31.770> not<00:05:32.010> as<00:05:32.190> dark<00:05:32.520> but<00:05:33.510> if<00:05:33.600> you<00:05:33.720> have<00:05:33.870> a

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.200 
out it's not as dark but if you have a

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.860 
out it's not as dark but if you have a
really<00:05:34.530> young<00:05:34.889> really<00:05:35.460> light<00:05:35.940> skin<00:05:36.570> color

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
really young really light skin color

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.230 
really young really light skin color
then<00:05:37.260> I<00:05:37.500> think<00:05:38.070> this<00:05:38.190> one<00:05:38.370> would<00:05:38.460> be<00:05:38.520> perfect

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:39.240 
then I think this one would be perfect

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.050 
then I think this one would be perfect
um<00:05:39.680> if<00:05:40.680> you<00:05:40.919> want<00:05:41.310> to<00:05:41.370> go<00:05:41.430> for<00:05:41.639> a<00:05:41.669> cheaper

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060 
um if you want to go for a cheaper

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.540 
um if you want to go for a cheaper
alternative<00:05:42.440> so<00:05:43.440> that's<00:05:43.800> pretty<00:05:43.980> much<00:05:44.160> that

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:44.550 
alternative so that's pretty much that

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.780
