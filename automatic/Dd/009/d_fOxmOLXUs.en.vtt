00:05:58.279 --> 00:05:58.289 
was settings went away it's not under

00:05:58.289 --> 00:05:59.600 
was settings went away it's not under
the<00:05:58.409> quit<00:05:58.590> menu<00:05:58.889> which<00:05:59.070> is<00:05:59.250> said<00:05:59.400> it<00:05:59.490> was

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
the quit menu which is said it was

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.159 
the quit menu which is said it was
supposed<00:05:59.909> to<00:05:59.969> be<00:06:00.090> there<00:06:00.270> when<00:06:00.449> I<00:06:00.479> activated<00:06:01.020> it

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:01.169 
supposed to be there when I activated it

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:03.140 
supposed to be there when I activated it
so<00:06:01.770> it<00:06:01.889> took<00:06:01.979> me<00:06:02.130> approximately<00:06:02.250> six<00:06:02.759> to<00:06:02.849> seven

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
so it took me approximately six to seven

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:05.120 
so it took me approximately six to seven
minutes<00:06:03.389> actually<00:06:03.659> figure<00:06:03.900> out<00:06:03.960> how<00:06:04.830> to<00:06:04.889> get

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.130 
minutes actually figure out how to get

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.399 
minutes actually figure out how to get
it<00:06:05.250> back<00:06:05.430> because<00:06:05.880> now<00:06:06.810> I<00:06:06.840> couldn't<00:06:07.259> change

00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:07.409 
it back because now I couldn't change

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:09.080 
it back because now I couldn't change
anything<00:06:07.620> wrong<00:06:08.009> with<00:06:08.130> Cody<00:06:08.400> now<00:06:08.789> I<00:06:08.820> couldn't

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:09.090 
anything wrong with Cody now I couldn't

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.629 
anything wrong with Cody now I couldn't
go<00:06:09.270> back<00:06:09.479> and<00:06:09.690> change<00:06:09.750> my<00:06:09.960> skin<00:06:10.229> or<00:06:10.620> fix<00:06:11.490> my

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:11.639 
go back and change my skin or fix my

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:13.520 
go back and change my skin or fix my
add-ons<00:06:12.060> my<00:06:12.449> shortcuts<00:06:12.990> or<00:06:13.110> anything<00:06:13.289> like

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 
that

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.459 
that
so<00:06:14.539> it<00:06:15.539> took<00:06:15.659> me<00:06:15.810> quite<00:06:15.840> a<00:06:15.990> while<00:06:16.080> I<00:06:16.199> went

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:16.469 
so it took me quite a while I went

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:18.409 
so it took me quite a while I went
through<00:06:16.620> almost<00:06:16.770> every<00:06:17.009> option<00:06:17.430> try<00:06:17.610> to<00:06:17.669> press

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:18.419 
through almost every option try to press

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:19.909 
through almost every option try to press
every<00:06:18.599> key<00:06:18.810> on<00:06:18.900> the<00:06:18.990> keyboard<00:06:19.169> shortcuts

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 
every key on the keyboard shortcuts

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:21.439 
every key on the keyboard shortcuts
anything<00:06:20.280> and<00:06:20.430> just<00:06:20.849> couldn't<00:06:21.120> figure<00:06:21.240> it<00:06:21.330> out

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:21.449 
anything and just couldn't figure it out

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:24.890 
anything and just couldn't figure it out
luckily<00:06:22.110> I<00:06:22.349> had<00:06:22.620> my<00:06:23.060> HTTP<00:06:24.060> remote<00:06:24.389> control<00:06:24.750> app

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:24.900 
luckily I had my HTTP remote control app

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.920 
luckily I had my HTTP remote control app
active<00:06:25.770> and<00:06:26.009> I<00:06:26.580> pretty<00:06:26.880> much<00:06:26.969> used<00:06:27.479> that<00:06:27.690> to

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:27.930 
active and I pretty much used that to

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.890 
active and I pretty much used that to
exit<00:06:28.560> out<00:06:28.710> and<00:06:28.949> change<00:06:29.340> the<00:06:29.520> skin<00:06:29.789> and<00:06:30.090> I<00:06:30.719> was
