00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
picked is at measure 32 and this

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:12.170

involves some ruffs check it out and

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.089 
involves some ruffs check it out and
this<00:02:12.630> is<00:02:12.780> written<00:02:13.050> as<00:02:13.170> a<00:02:13.200> four<00:02:13.590> stroke<00:02:13.800> rub

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
this is written as a four stroke rub

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:15.740 
this is written as a four stroke rub

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
which would actually mean that you play

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.750

you<00:02:20.489> just<00:02:20.640> make<00:02:21.060> a<00:02:21.090> buzz<00:02:21.390> on<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:22.440> drum<00:02:23.190> head

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
you just make a buzz on the drum head

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.650 
you just make a buzz on the drum head
get<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.010> similar<00:02:26.370> sound<00:02:26.580> up<00:02:27.030> over<00:02:27.269> the<00:02:27.360> counting

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
get a similar sound up over the counting

go<00:04:11.810> over<00:04:11.989> is<00:04:12.139> it<00:04:12.349> measure<00:04:12.590> 96<00:04:13.430> check<00:04:13.819> this<00:04:13.940> one

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
go over is it measure 96 check this one

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:19.060 
go over is it measure 96 check this one
out<00:04:16.750> so<00:04:17.750> the<00:04:17.840> counting<00:04:18.109> of<00:04:18.169> this<00:04:18.320> you<00:04:18.530> get<00:04:18.650> 1<00:04:18.859> &amp;

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:37.129 
able to take some of these ideas and
apply<00:04:35.909> them<00:04:36.150> to<00:04:36.180> your<00:04:36.389> drumming<00:04:36.659> is<00:04:36.870> really

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 
apply them to your drumming is really

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:38.629 
apply them to your drumming is really
what<00:04:37.259> we<00:04:37.349> want<00:04:37.530> to<00:04:37.590> be<00:04:37.650> able<00:04:37.740> to<00:04:37.919> do<00:04:38.099> you<00:04:38.490> could

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 
what we want to be able to do you could

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:40.219 
what we want to be able to do you could
pull<00:04:38.759> any<00:04:39.000> one<00:04:39.270> of<00:04:39.300> these<00:04:39.479> measures<00:04:39.990> and

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
pull any one of these measures and

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:42.710 
pull any one of these measures and
create<00:04:41.220> a<00:04:41.250> new<00:04:41.520> fill<00:04:41.819> out<00:04:42.000> of<00:04:42.150> it<00:04:42.270> so<00:04:42.569> if<00:04:42.629> we

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 
create a new fill out of it so if we

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.320 
create a new fill out of it so if we
take<00:04:42.870> say<00:04:43.199> measure<00:04:43.500> 36<00:04:44.400> and<00:04:44.669> just<00:04:45.000> that<00:04:45.150> one

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
take say measure 36 and just that one

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.450 
take say measure 36 and just that one
measure<00:04:45.569> alone<00:04:45.960> we<00:04:46.379> can<00:04:46.530> use<00:04:46.650> that<00:04:46.860> as<00:04:47.099> a<00:04:47.129> drum

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
measure alone we can use that as a drum

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.339 
measure alone we can use that as a drum
fill<00:04:47.669> I<00:04:47.909> might<00:04:48.180> be<00:04:48.270> playing<00:04:48.389> just<00:04:48.720> a<00:04:48.810> basic<00:04:49.139> six

00:04:49.339 --> 00:04:49.349 
fill I might be playing just a basic six

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:52.010 
fill I might be playing just a basic six
eight<00:04:49.530> five<00:04:50.190> six<00:04:50.550> one<00:04:50.789> two<00:04:50.970> three<00:04:51.479> four<00:04:51.750> five

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
eight five six one two three four five

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:58.580 
eight five six one two three four five
now<00:04:52.199> I'm<00:04:52.259> going<00:04:52.379> to<00:04:52.440> play<00:04:52.560> measure<00:04:52.800> 36<00:04:57.440> I'll<00:04:58.440> do

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
now I'm going to play measure 36 I'll do

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:07.760 
now I'm going to play measure 36 I'll do
it<00:04:58.650> again<00:04:58.740> I<00:05:06.050> could<00:05:07.050> do<00:05:07.169> the<00:05:07.319> same<00:05:07.349> thing<00:05:07.560> like

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
it again I could do the same thing like

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.119 
it again I could do the same thing like
go<00:05:08.069> back<00:05:08.250> to<00:05:08.370> measure<00:05:08.580> 16<00:05:09.000> just<00:05:09.479> for<00:05:09.569> the<00:05:09.659> basic

00:05:10.119 --> 00:05:10.129 
go back to measure 16 just for the basic

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:14.029 
go back to measure 16 just for the basic
six<00:05:11.129> eight<00:05:11.310> two<00:05:11.699> three<00:05:11.969> four<00:05:12.300> five<00:05:12.860> I'm<00:05:13.860> gonna

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:14.039 
six eight two three four five I'm gonna

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:21.619 
six eight two three four five I'm gonna
play<00:05:14.219> measures<00:05:14.580> 16<00:05:20.240> see<00:05:21.240> what's<00:05:21.419> cool<00:05:21.599> about

00:05:21.619 --> 00:05:21.629 
play measures 16 see what's cool about

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:24.080 
play measures 16 see what's cool about
this<00:05:21.990> Tuesday's<00:05:22.770> gone<00:05:22.979> is<00:05:23.310> that<00:05:23.550> the<00:05:23.819> fills

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
this Tuesday's gone is that the fills

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.629 
this Tuesday's gone is that the fills
are<00:05:24.330> really<00:05:24.599> two<00:05:24.780> measures<00:05:25.139> long<00:05:25.349> so<00:05:26.099> we<00:05:26.520> get

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 
are really two measures long so we get

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:28.129 
are really two measures long so we get
twice<00:05:26.849> the<00:05:27.120> amount<00:05:27.180> of<00:05:27.389> fills<00:05:27.629> to<00:05:27.780> work<00:05:27.960> with

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:28.139 
twice the amount of fills to work with

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:29.959 
twice the amount of fills to work with
and<00:05:28.349> of<00:05:28.680> course<00:05:28.919> like<00:05:29.099> in<00:05:29.130> the<00:05:29.310> other<00:05:29.430> lessons

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:29.969 
and of course like in the other lessons

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:32.209 
and of course like in the other lessons
you<00:05:30.719> can<00:05:30.840> move<00:05:31.050> the<00:05:31.169> sticks<00:05:31.409> around<00:05:31.710> maybe<00:05:32.069> to

00:05:32.209 --> 00:05:32.219 
you can move the sticks around maybe to

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:33.920 
you can move the sticks around maybe to
the<00:05:32.310> hi-hat<00:05:32.669> you<00:05:32.789> can<00:05:32.909> hit<00:05:33.029> different<00:05:33.419> times

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
the hi-hat you can hit different times

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:35.570 
the hi-hat you can hit different times
you<00:05:34.199> can<00:05:34.349> even<00:05:34.500> change<00:05:34.770> some<00:05:34.979> of<00:05:35.009> the<00:05:35.159> times<00:05:35.400> to

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
you can even change some of the times to

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:37.700 
you can even change some of the times to
crash<00:05:36.060> cymbals<00:05:36.449> there's<00:05:36.960> all<00:05:37.139> kinds<00:05:37.409> of<00:05:37.469> stuff

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
crash cymbals there's all kinds of stuff

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:38.779 
crash cymbals there's all kinds of stuff
that<00:05:37.740> you<00:05:37.919> can<00:05:38.099> do<00:05:38.190> with<00:05:38.310> this<00:05:38.430> this<00:05:38.580> is<00:05:38.639> a

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:38.789 
that you can do with this this is a
