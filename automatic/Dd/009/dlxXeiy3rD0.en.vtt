00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:03.620
 here is a tutorial to learn how to create a border in all courtesy 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.220
 for example to kill a policeman 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.839
 this border this country goes back enamel 

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:12.650
 the first thing to do that to make a noose to ride the 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.929
 first bride 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.900
 the only colors to attacked 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.900
 around vegetables 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:27.509
 while she was taking a mattress knitting 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.140
 at the location 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.570
 but we do not drop 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:35.820
 the mesh 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.980
 delegate left we will rather drag the hand and that we just 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.060
 create a right ankle on the left grids 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.060
 to get hurt 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.820
 in fact the same way to create a third brand 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.990
 ft ama I just created on the blog on the left and therefore three mails 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.640
 and so on the first four 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.640
 5 mail 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.490
 and that's the penalty 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.300
 mounted 5 evil 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.550
 now we will start creating the high court border for this it will take 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.410
 beat one of the five evil 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.410
 to shoot down the mails we start with a shout next to them 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.430
 and we flap 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.710
 the first knitted stitch we did in the past above 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:36.520
 this is the second 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.420
 here I am flipping trimaille and once again and I will pass the mesh 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.420
 who stay on the winged right on the left eight 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.370
 for the Malian MVP5 volt 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:21.879
 and once again the cjb down mali 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:33.019
 the capabilities the right mesh 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.639
 nor left 

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:40.409
 So we start at cannes we start to see the border tiko 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:43.409
 and this form 

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:47.529
 so for my country and to make that border by continuing to ride the 

00:02:47.529 --> 00:02:49.619
 emails as shown on the template 

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:52.539
 and as we go up the bank will form
