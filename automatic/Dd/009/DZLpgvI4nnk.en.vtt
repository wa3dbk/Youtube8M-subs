00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790 
people what if you segmented the race

people what if you segmented the race
that<00:00:40.030> we<00:00:40.149> are<00:00:40.180> and<00:00:40.540> formed<00:00:41.500> something<00:00:41.739> that

00:00:42.029 --> 00:00:42.039 
that we are and formed something that

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:44.580 
that we are and formed something that
he's<00:00:42.370> partly<00:00:43.239> us<00:00:43.480> but<00:00:43.750> not<00:00:43.870> really<00:00:44.230> like<00:00:44.410> us

the<00:00:45.070> half-breeds<00:00:45.430> were<00:00:45.520> formed<00:00:45.850> out<00:00:45.910> of<00:00:46.059> that

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:46.149 
the half-breeds were formed out of that

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:47.340 
the half-breeds were formed out of that
by<00:00:46.570> this<00:00:46.629> point

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
by this point

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:48.899 
by this point
hundreds<00:00:48.010> and<00:00:48.039> hundreds<00:00:48.429> of<00:00:48.460> years<00:00:48.670> of

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:48.909 
hundreds and hundreds of years of

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:50.459 
hundreds and hundreds of years of
struggle<00:00:49.600> has<00:00:49.719> already<00:00:49.989> kind<00:00:50.140> of<00:00:50.170> occurred

00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:50.469 
struggle has already kind of occurred

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:52.349 
struggle has already kind of occurred
between<00:00:50.649> humans<00:00:51.519> and<00:00:51.699> the<00:00:51.850> half-breeds

00:00:52.349 --> 00:00:52.359 
between humans and the half-breeds

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:54.599 
between humans and the half-breeds
basically<00:00:53.079> our<00:00:53.289> story<00:00:53.679> kind<00:00:54.069> of<00:00:54.129> paints<00:00:54.460> them

00:00:54.599 --> 00:00:54.609 
basically our story kind of paints them

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:56.729 
basically our story kind of paints them
as<00:00:54.819> another<00:00:55.239> top<00:00:55.600> tiered<00:00:55.899> redditor<00:00:56.350> just<00:00:56.559> like

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
as another top tiered redditor just like

werewolf is something that came from a

werewolf is something that came from a
law<00:01:06.400> that<00:01:06.610> they<00:01:06.729> probably<00:01:06.880> believed<00:01:07.300> in

law that they probably believed in

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:09.240 
law that they probably believed in

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
thousands of years ago when it actually

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.649 
thousands of years ago when it actually
was<00:01:09.430> a<00:01:09.460> half<00:01:09.729> grade<00:01:10.030> and<00:01:10.210> evolution<00:01:10.630> of

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 
was a half grade and evolution of

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
mankind they still are I would say

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.510 
mankind they still are I would say
anatomically<00:01:14.380> similar<00:01:14.620> in<00:01:14.920> humans<00:01:15.250> but<00:01:15.370> they

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
anatomically similar in humans but they

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.770 
anatomically similar in humans but they
have<00:01:15.729> you<00:01:15.909> know<00:01:16.030> there's<00:01:16.240> obviously<00:01:16.390> they're

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
have you know there's obviously they're

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.600 
have you know there's obviously they're
much<00:01:16.990> taller<00:01:17.320> they're<00:01:17.770> bigger<00:01:17.979> they<00:01:18.400> have

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
much taller they're bigger they have

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.250 
much taller they're bigger they have
hides<00:01:18.850> that<00:01:19.060> are<00:01:19.150> thicker<00:01:19.420> their<00:01:19.840> musculature

is<00:01:20.680> slightly<00:01:20.890> augmented<00:01:21.550> the<00:01:21.700> reason<00:01:22.360> why<00:01:22.480> the

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
is slightly augmented the reason why the

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.020 
is slightly augmented the reason why the
Lycans<00:01:23.110> and<00:01:23.440> that's<00:01:23.920> particular<00:01:24.400> species<00:01:24.760> of

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.820 
Lycans and that's particular species of
half-breed<00:01:25.330> is<00:01:25.570> a<00:01:25.630> threat<00:01:25.990> it<00:01:26.440> was<00:01:26.590> a<00:01:26.620> question

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 
half-breed is a threat it was a question

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.530 
half-breed is a threat it was a question
of<00:01:27.040> understanding<00:01:27.190> what<00:01:27.940> it<00:01:28.060> was<00:01:28.210> about

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
of understanding what it was about

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.410 
of understanding what it was about
the<00:01:28.990> werewolf<00:01:29.500> more<00:01:29.920> that<00:01:30.310> is<00:01:30.550> as<00:01:30.790> intelligent

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
the werewolf more that is as intelligent

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.330 
the werewolf more that is as intelligent
as<00:01:31.510> you<00:01:31.540> are<00:01:31.630> but<00:01:31.930> it's<00:01:32.140> as<00:01:32.260> beasts<00:01:32.590> you<00:01:32.800> as<00:01:32.980> a

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
as you are but it's as beasts you as a

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.460 
as you are but it's as beasts you as a
wolf<00:01:33.790> group<00:01:34.000> I<00:01:34.210> think<00:01:34.720> to<00:01:35.050> me<00:01:35.170> the<00:01:35.320> most

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
wolf group I think to me the most

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:36.990 
wolf group I think to me the most
terrifying<00:01:35.890> thing<00:01:36.130> is<00:01:36.310> that<00:01:36.490> we<00:01:36.670> try<00:01:36.970> to

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
terrifying thing is that we try to

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.390 
terrifying thing is that we try to
basically<00:01:37.480> always<00:01:37.930> have<00:01:38.230> some<00:01:38.500> degree<00:01:38.650> of<00:01:38.830> a

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
basically always have some degree of a

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.400 
basically always have some degree of a
performance<00:01:40.180> and<00:01:40.300> them<00:01:40.480> that<00:01:40.690> carries<00:01:41.230> a

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:41.410 
performance and them that carries a

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.560 
performance and them that carries a
level<00:01:41.770> of<00:01:41.860> intelligence<00:01:42.400> they<00:01:42.820> are<00:01:43.060> smart<00:01:43.390> I

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
level of intelligence they are smart I

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.150 
level of intelligence they are smart I
think<00:01:43.660> to<00:01:43.990> me<00:01:44.110> that's<00:01:44.290> actually<00:01:44.500> the<00:01:44.830> scariest

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
think to me that's actually the scariest

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.710 
think to me that's actually the scariest
thing<00:01:45.310> about<00:01:45.490> that<00:01:45.700> and<00:01:45.820> when<00:01:45.970> something<00:01:46.360> can

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
thing about that and when something can

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.370 
thing about that and when something can
look<00:01:46.960> at<00:01:47.170> you<00:01:47.560> size<00:01:48.100> you<00:01:48.310> up<00:01:48.340> and<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:49.810> be<00:01:50.140> at

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
look at you size you up and it be at

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.680 
look at you size you up and it be at
your<00:01:50.650> equal<00:01:51.010> if<00:01:51.190> not<00:01:51.220> above<00:01:51.850> you<00:01:52.060> I<00:01:52.240> think<00:01:52.570> it

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
your equal if not above you I think it

00:01:52.690 --> 00:02:00.090

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
allowed us to achieve that was this

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.440 
allowed us to achieve that was this
credit<00:03:34.280> processed<00:03:34.760> and<00:03:34.970> then<00:03:35.060> the<00:03:35.209> hair

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
credit processed and then the hair

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.479 
credit processed and then the hair
growth<00:03:35.750> was<00:03:35.989> another<00:03:36.230> challenge<00:03:36.530> as<00:03:36.830> they're

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489
