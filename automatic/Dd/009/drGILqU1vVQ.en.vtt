what<00:03:52.430> music<00:03:52.580> I<00:03:52.970> remember<00:03:53.299> from<00:03:53.390> the<00:03:53.569> 90<00:03:53.900> I

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
what music I remember from the 90 I

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.170 
what music I remember from the 90 I
don't<00:03:54.200> think<00:03:54.410> about<00:03:54.530> music<00:03:55.069> you<00:03:55.280> know<00:03:55.970> in

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
don't think about music you know in

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.880 
don't think about music you know in
terms<00:03:56.420> of<00:03:56.629> the<00:03:57.140> theory<00:03:57.440> that<00:03:57.590> it<00:03:57.860> was

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
terms of the theory that it was

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.600 
terms of the theory that it was
necessarily<00:03:58.670> only<00:03:59.319> do<00:04:00.319> I<00:04:00.349> like<00:04:00.620> this<00:04:00.769> maybe

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
necessarily only do I like this maybe

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.449 
necessarily only do I like this maybe
not<00:04:01.819> so<00:04:02.000> much<00:04:02.209> I<00:04:02.920> always<00:04:04.959> understand<00:04:05.959> these

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
not so much I always understand these

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:11.350 
not so much I always understand these
original<00:04:07.459> influences<00:04:08.500> from<00:04:09.500> the<00:04:10.150> time<00:04:11.150> in<00:04:11.269> the

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
original influences from the time in the

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.630 
original influences from the time in the
past<00:04:11.599> and<00:04:12.019> those<00:04:12.260> things<00:04:12.590> intimacies<00:04:13.190> from

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
past and those things intimacies from

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.110 
past and those things intimacies from
even<00:04:14.060> further<00:04:14.269> back<00:04:14.599> so<00:04:14.660> often

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
even further back so often

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:24.150 
even further back so often
personally<00:04:17.120> I<00:04:17.570> don't<00:04:17.959> hear<00:04:18.229> many<00:04:18.380> singers

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.520 

well<00:04:24.970> obviously<00:04:26.310> with<00:04:27.310> the<00:04:27.940> advent<00:04:28.390> of<00:04:28.540> next

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:29.530 
well obviously with the advent of next

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.299 
well obviously with the advent of next
then<00:04:30.250> Spotify<00:04:30.970> I<00:04:31.120> had<00:04:31.300> be<00:04:31.480> internet<00:04:32.020> so

00:04:33.299 --> 00:04:33.309 
then Spotify I had be internet so

00:04:33.309 --> 00:04:35.549 
then Spotify I had be internet so
very<00:04:33.819> few<00:04:33.939> people<00:04:34.329> are<00:04:34.569> setting<00:04:34.869> records<00:04:34.899> now

00:04:35.549 --> 00:04:35.559 
very few people are setting records now

00:04:35.559 --> 00:04:41.039 
very few people are setting records now
so<00:04:36.989> back<00:04:37.989> then<00:04:38.289> we<00:04:38.799> used<00:04:39.039> to<00:04:39.309> talk<00:04:39.819> to<00:04:40.689> the<00:04:40.899> hope

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:41.049 
so back then we used to talk to the hope

00:04:41.049 --> 00:04:43.799 
so back then we used to talk to the hope
of<00:04:41.169> setting<00:04:41.499> records<00:04:41.859> and<00:04:42.309> now<00:04:42.489> the<00:04:43.479> records

00:04:43.799 --> 00:04:43.809 
of setting records and now the records

00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:45.239 
of setting records and now the records
that<00:04:43.929> we<00:04:44.139> make<00:04:44.319> a<00:04:44.349> more<00:04:44.649> of<00:04:44.739> a<00:04:44.799> labor<00:04:44.979> of<00:04:45.159> love

00:04:45.239 --> 00:04:45.249 
that we make a more of a labor of love

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:48.209 
that we make a more of a labor of love
and<00:04:45.959> they<00:04:46.959> advertise<00:04:47.439> the<00:04:47.649> fact<00:04:47.679> that<00:04:47.979> we're

00:04:48.209 --> 00:04:48.219

still<00:04:48.489> alive<00:04:49.209> and<00:04:50.369> and<00:04:51.369> then<00:04:51.609> we<00:04:51.699> play<00:04:51.939> live

00:04:52.769 --> 00:04:52.779
