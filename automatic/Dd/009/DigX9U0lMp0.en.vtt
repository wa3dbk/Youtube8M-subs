00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.920
 my team too because now this 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.359
 what happens is that I miss 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.859
 graciously contract all my 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.390
 defenders all the players here are in 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.140
 lack of contract so what are we going to do 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.699

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.080

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.279
 Finally like that but worth the 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.559
 control more and more I have chances 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.760
 to have something for once 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.969
