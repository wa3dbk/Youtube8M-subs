00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.610
 Hello I'm the martin of the bit 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.570
 Guitar views and I'll show you today 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:31.760
 the regulators 151 a little very 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.010
 lighter m with its just over 13 kilo 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.440
 and its small size really good 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.420
 and easy to transport and now 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.450
 I show a simple construction again 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.640
 I want to start with the input 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.040
 socket above the one - ten decibels 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.960
 switch is also for deep basses then 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.610
 we have a game drive songs the 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.780
 I explained more exactly how 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.940
 who play together 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.970
 Then we sounded three years old 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:59.690
 regulation with the best at 40 now 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:03.260
 middle forest between 180 and 1000 yards 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.840
 and the heights are one at four clubs 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:09.080
 master controller on the earth another de 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.540
 on the post is switchable and a brown 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.370
 has one last at last 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.060
 switch the back is relative 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:19.610
 Spartan kept with electricity 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:22.970
 a speakern connection and a nice 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.340
 art jack and now i just show 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.060
 three sound samples what to do with the money 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:31.340
 And the motto can do everything 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.380
 the first is relatively klien the second 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.509
 set what counted and that you more 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.299
 Of course, they are just consumed 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:40.460
 exemplary and between you can also 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:42.320
 adjust everything you like so much 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.229
 I'll just show you something 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.460
 is possible with these two professionals and 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.229
 I just want to start 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.229
 told them sound 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.920
 Now I just want to show how 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.230
 the emd with different measure like that 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.150
 That sounds like it was a passive one 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.920
 pass and now we come to one 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.920
 active speckled five page 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.209
 and want to show that the amp too 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.890
 relatively good certain vintage sound 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:13.019
 can map I say one now 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.019
 sandbags with a HÃ¶fner works that 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.320
 all previous sound samples were one 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:32.340
 Mixing of microphone signal and the 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.900
 Skin signal 50 50 ratio and now 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.970
 I'll show you the art and that again 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.680
 microphone signals each sound alone 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.680
 I would like to start with microphone signal 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:53.799
 now the one signal 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:08.140
 ok has now been able to make a picture 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.660
 again with different best and 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.060
 different settings sounds like that 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:16.049
 I have the server and I'm really 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.920
 satisfied with the m 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.140
 some may consider 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:23.260
 he did not have that with 250 watts 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:24.460
 I would be ample of accomplishment 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.860
 never hit the performance limit 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.770
 with a good 4 o box of money is enough 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.600
 really everywhere 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:34.630
 the teams are the idiosyncrasies that they are 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.520
 sound relatively well possible and im 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.040
 compare to all digital divide because 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.140
 many would be relatively sharp in the heights 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:44.530
 if you continue to turn up that have 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:47.320
 just not in comparison to 500 as 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.560
 is that the 350s as you too 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.390
 expected a little less volume 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.460
 performance and also a little less 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.650
 Headroom has what you are looking for 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.510
 bass range more 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.460
 but if you look at the features of the 500 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.320
 can offer more offers it has 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.740
 definitely a good choice 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.150
 especially if you look at the price 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:11.320
 the amp has a two small drawbacks 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:14.290
 Personally striking personally 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:16.780
 just disturb that for one of that 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.830
 he only has a speaker output so 

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.810
 if you have a box for now 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.720
 example also has only one entrance and 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.940
 no exit could drag on 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.919
 get a problem and the second one is 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.479
 that the fan after a short time 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:30.190
 jump on then no longer runs out and 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:33.250
 also for digital part of a relative 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:36.940
 loud fan is installed but I come 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:38.400
 The disadvantages are relatively clear and I am 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:42.580
 very satisfied with the m 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:44.470
 that was it from my side and stay 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.590
 tuned just look again for it 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:50.340
 more will follow 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:50.340
 So that's good
