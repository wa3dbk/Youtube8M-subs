00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.840
 my computer he was he was 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.000

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.369

 strong old man he was fallen but the cougar 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.659
 here he was fallen for 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.570
 around let's sedate it we go with 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.170
 explaining here he was falling for the 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:28.470

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:31.880

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:39.990
 I was fps falling to 20 pradesh ps from here 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.790
 I did I told them I thought 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.759
 here is why because always starting 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.110
 Grow things tend to work out more 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.840
 mine did not work 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.479
 It is okay but this is not a bad side 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.399
 I did I went to turn on the pc knows in time 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.070
 that you link the mayor in two modules 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.960
 have initial thought recovery mode or 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.729
 start the main normal mode 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.649
 I put on start normal mode what 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.469
 happened and blinked and returned to the 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:07.950
 start recovery mode or there 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:10.440
 in normal mode I was the only one who 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.000
 I have left is that the recovery mode but 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.510
 Why do I look like a module? 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.020
 operation did not work well but okay and 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.760
 hence the computer did not care about me 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.070
 I had to format and I'll try to summarize 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.510

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.040

 the network card, the computer 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.400
 I was preaching from there that I had to 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.720
 I had to kill myself behind the 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.530

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.209

 strolling hunting the right people but at last 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.460
 it's bad to play commenting on high density 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:41.169
 because always concentrating even is 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.270

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:47.949
