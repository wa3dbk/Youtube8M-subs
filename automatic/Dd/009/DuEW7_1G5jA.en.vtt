00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.980 

starting<00:00:05.130> with<00:00:05.220> dark<00:00:05.490> grid<00:00:05.700> make<00:00:06.390> a<00:00:06.420> base<00:00:06.720> of

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
starting with dark grid make a base of

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.850 
starting with dark grid make a base of
14<00:00:07.490> so<00:00:08.490> take<00:00:08.700> three<00:00:08.910> pieces<00:00:09.090> and<00:00:09.830> put<00:00:10.830> them

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
14 so take three pieces and put them

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.160 
14 so take three pieces and put them
together<00:00:11.130> like<00:00:11.309> this<00:00:14.509> make<00:00:15.509> fourteen<00:00:15.960> of

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
together like this make fourteen of

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:29.689 
together like this make fourteen of
these<00:00:27.320> once<00:00:28.320> you're<00:00:28.529> 14<00:00:28.680> connect<00:00:29.279> them<00:00:29.429> into<00:00:29.640> a

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
these once you're 14 connect them into a

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:45.829 
these once you're 14 connect them into a
circle

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:45.839 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:48.930 

so<00:00:46.839> I've<00:00:46.929> got<00:00:47.109> three<00:00:47.320> rows<00:00:47.559> now<00:00:48.429> add<00:00:48.640> four<00:00:48.910> more

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
so I've got three rows now add four more

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:58.219 
so I've got three rows now add four more
rows<00:00:49.269> so<00:00:50.019> you'll<00:00:50.199> have<00:00:50.350> seven<00:00:50.559> rows<00:00:50.800> in<00:00:51.010> total

00:00:58.219 --> 00:00:58.229 

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:00.360 

I'm<00:00:59.229> just<00:00:59.500> going<00:00:59.649> to<00:00:59.680> mold<00:00:59.859> it<00:01:00.010> to<00:01:00.070> make<00:01:00.280> it

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
I'm just going to mold it to make it

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.670 
I'm just going to mold it to make it
into<00:01:00.579> a<00:01:00.609> round<00:01:00.789> shape<00:01:01.049> so<00:01:02.049> just<00:01:02.289> bend<00:01:02.500> these

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
into a round shape so just bend these

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:10.499 
into a round shape so just bend these
two<00:01:02.920> ends<00:01:03.129> in<00:01:08.729> now<00:01:09.729> for<00:01:10.000> the<00:01:10.090> shirt<00:01:10.299> you're

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:10.509 
two ends in now for the shirt you're

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:12.180 
two ends in now for the shirt you're
going<00:01:10.659> to<00:01:10.720> remove<00:01:10.960> four<00:01:11.020> pieces<00:01:11.619> and<00:01:11.860> then

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:12.190 
going to remove four pieces and then

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:30.969 
going to remove four pieces and then
three<00:01:12.430> pieces<00:01:19.229> now<00:01:20.229> fill<00:01:20.440> this<00:01:20.619> in<00:01:20.830> with<00:01:20.860> pink

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.160 

since<00:01:31.640> Hello<00:01:31.880> Kitty<00:01:32.060> has<00:01:32.270> overalls<00:01:32.719> it<00:01:32.990> should

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
since Hello Kitty has overalls it should

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.020 
since Hello Kitty has overalls it should
be<00:01:33.320> pink<00:01:33.560> at<00:01:33.710> the<00:01:33.799> back<00:01:33.950> so<00:01:34.549> just<00:01:34.759> from<00:01:34.909> the

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
be pink at the back so just from the

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.940 
be pink at the back so just from the
sides<00:01:35.270> count<00:01:35.600> three<00:01:35.810> pieces<00:01:36.020> and<00:01:36.439> you<00:01:36.799> should

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
sides count three pieces and you should

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.249 
sides count three pieces and you should
have<00:01:37.070> four<00:01:37.310> pieces<00:01:37.490> in<00:01:37.759> between<00:01:38.090> so<00:01:38.990> just

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
have four pieces in between so just

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:40.959 
have four pieces in between so just
remove<00:01:39.500> these<00:01:39.710> four<00:01:39.950> pieces<00:01:40.159> and<00:01:40.579> the<00:01:40.759> three

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:40.969 
remove these four pieces and the three

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:43.120 
remove these four pieces and the three
pieces<00:01:41.179> underneath<00:01:41.570> and<00:01:41.899> replace<00:01:42.740> with<00:01:42.890> pink

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
pieces underneath and replace with pink

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.700 
pieces underneath and replace with pink
so<00:01:43.880> it<00:01:43.969> should<00:01:44.149> be<00:01:44.179> just<00:01:44.329> like<00:01:44.689> this<00:01:44.899> now<00:01:45.500> for

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
so it should be just like this now for

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.080 
so it should be just like this now for
the<00:01:45.770> head<00:01:45.950> you<00:01:46.100> want<00:01:46.130> to<00:01:46.280> make<00:01:46.399> it<00:01:46.520> bigger<00:01:46.700> so

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
the head you want to make it bigger so

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.270 
the head you want to make it bigger so
this<00:01:47.270> is<00:01:47.390> a<00:01:47.420> base<00:01:47.659> of<00:01:47.689> 18<00:01:48.200> this<00:01:48.770> one<00:01:49.009> was<00:01:49.159> made

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
this is a base of 18 this one was made

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.160 
this is a base of 18 this one was made
separately<00:01:49.789> but<00:01:50.600> I'm<00:01:50.780> going<00:01:50.929> to<00:01:50.990> try

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
separately but I'm going to try

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.359 
separately but I'm going to try
something<00:01:51.470> different<00:01:51.590> and<00:01:51.950> make<00:01:52.159> it<00:01:52.280> all

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
something different and make it all

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.219 
something different and make it all
connected<00:01:52.729> so<00:01:53.270> you<00:01:53.329> can<00:01:53.479> start<00:01:53.689> again<00:01:53.990> make<00:01:54.200> a

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
connected so you can start again make a

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:55.990 
connected so you can start again make a
base<00:01:54.439> of<00:01:54.590> 18<00:01:54.950> and<00:01:55.219> then<00:01:55.549> you're<00:01:55.670> going<00:01:55.759> to<00:01:55.819> glue

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
base of 18 and then you're going to glue

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.059 
base of 18 and then you're going to glue
the<00:01:56.119> head<00:01:56.240> on<00:01:56.329> later<00:01:56.539> or<00:01:56.869> if<00:01:57.679> you<00:01:57.770> want<00:01:57.920> to<00:01:57.950> make

00:01:58.059 --> 00:01:58.069 
the head on later or if you want to make

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:00.279 
the head on later or if you want to make
it<00:01:58.189> connected<00:01:58.579> then<00:01:59.119> just<00:01:59.420> make<00:01:59.569> one<00:01:59.780> inverted

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
it connected then just make one inverted

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:02.620 
it connected then just make one inverted
row<00:02:00.490> so<00:02:01.490> instead<00:02:01.850> of<00:02:01.909> putting<00:02:02.149> it<00:02:02.329> this<00:02:02.450> way

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
row so instead of putting it this way

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.320 
row so instead of putting it this way
turn<00:02:03.110> the<00:02:03.229> piece<00:02:03.380> around<00:02:03.970> so<00:02:04.970> that<00:02:05.000> the

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
turn the piece around so that the

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:15.640 
turn the piece around so that the
straight<00:02:05.569> side<00:02:05.750> faces<00:02:06.140> you<00:02:14.079> now<00:02:15.079> add<00:02:15.260> one<00:02:15.470> more

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
straight side faces you now add one more

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.500 
straight side faces you now add one more
row<00:02:15.829> this<00:02:16.220> time<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.610> piece<00:02:16.790> is<00:02:16.910> gone<00:02:17.090> normally

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
row this time the piece is gone normally

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:25.660 
row this time the piece is gone normally
at<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:17.989> bumpy<00:02:18.260> side<00:02:18.380> facing<00:02:18.799> out<00:02:24.280> now<00:02:25.280> this<00:02:25.519> is

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
at the bumpy side facing out now this is

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.339 
at the bumpy side facing out now this is
a<00:02:25.700> row<00:02:25.910> of<00:02:26.030> 14<00:02:26.480> and<00:02:26.690> you<00:02:26.810> want<00:02:26.959> to<00:02:27.019> make<00:02:27.140> it<00:02:27.290> a

00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:27.349 
a row of 14 and you want to make it a

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:29.380 
a row of 14 and you want to make it a
row<00:02:27.500> of<00:02:27.680> 18<00:02:28.069> so<00:02:28.670> we're<00:02:28.790> going<00:02:28.910> to<00:02:29.000> add<00:02:29.120> four

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
row of 18 so we're going to add four

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.059 
row of 18 so we're going to add four
more<00:02:29.420> pieces<00:02:29.750> to<00:02:30.019> this<00:02:30.140> row<00:02:30.349> so<00:02:30.829> I'm<00:02:30.920> just

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
more pieces to this row so I'm just

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:32.800 
more pieces to this row so I'm just
going<00:02:31.190> to<00:02:31.280> add<00:02:31.400> it<00:02:31.489> on<00:02:31.579> the<00:02:31.670> sides<00:02:31.910> find<00:02:32.720> the

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
going to add it on the sides find the

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.750 
going to add it on the sides find the
middle<00:02:32.989> which<00:02:33.440> is<00:02:33.470> here<00:02:33.860> then<00:02:34.340> just<00:02:34.610> keep

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
middle which is here then just keep

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.280 
middle which is here then just keep
moving<00:02:35.090> on<00:02:35.150> to<00:02:35.299> the<00:02:35.420> next<00:02:35.540> piece<00:02:35.780> till<00:02:36.170> you

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
moving on to the next piece till you

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.050 
moving on to the next piece till you
find<00:02:36.500> the<00:02:36.560> sides<00:02:36.799> so<00:02:37.400> these<00:02:37.579> are<00:02:37.790> the<00:02:37.880> side

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
find the sides so these are the side

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.030 
find the sides so these are the side
pieces<00:02:38.299> you've<00:02:38.930> got<00:02:39.139> six<00:02:39.410> pieces<00:02:39.620> in<00:02:39.920> between

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
pieces you've got six pieces in between

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.140 
pieces you've got six pieces in between
them<00:02:40.400> so<00:02:41.090> we're<00:02:41.180> going<00:02:41.299> to<00:02:41.359> remove<00:02:41.630> these<00:02:41.989> and

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
them so we're going to remove these and

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.400 
them so we're going to remove these and
instead<00:02:44.150> of<00:02:44.209> putting<00:02:44.510> a<00:02:44.630> piece<00:02:44.810> on<00:02:44.989> like<00:02:45.200> this

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
instead of putting a piece on like this

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.800 
instead of putting a piece on like this
you<00:02:45.920> just<00:02:46.130> insert<00:02:46.579> with<00:02:46.819> one<00:02:47.030> pocket<00:02:47.269> and<00:02:47.630> you

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
you just insert with one pocket and you

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.990 
you just insert with one pocket and you
leave<00:02:48.019> the<00:02:48.170> other<00:02:48.290> one<00:02:48.470> empty<00:02:51.549> so<00:02:52.549> this<00:02:52.760> lets

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
leave the other one empty so this lets

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.180 
leave the other one empty so this lets
you<00:02:53.090> add<00:02:53.209> an<00:02:53.359> extra<00:02:53.600> piece<00:02:53.810> so<00:02:54.560> again<00:02:54.859> you<00:02:54.980> use

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
you add an extra piece so again you use

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.190 
you add an extra piece so again you use
one<00:02:55.400> hole<00:02:55.609> leave<00:02:55.910> the<00:02:56.030> other<00:02:56.150> one<00:02:56.299> empty<00:02:59.049> so<00:03:00.049> in

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
one hole leave the other one empty so in

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.660 
one hole leave the other one empty so in
there<00:03:00.380> one<00:03:00.560> space<00:03:00.829> you<00:03:01.069> would<00:03:01.130> usually<00:03:01.340> have

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
there one space you would usually have

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.059 
there one space you would usually have
one<00:03:01.819> piece<00:03:02.060> but<00:03:02.510> instead<00:03:02.810> you<00:03:02.989> have<00:03:03.079> two<00:03:03.290> so<00:03:03.980> if

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
one piece but instead you have two so if

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:06.490 
one piece but instead you have two so if
just<00:03:04.220> increased<00:03:04.700> by<00:03:04.910> one<00:03:05.150> piece<00:03:05.389> so<00:03:06.139> do<00:03:06.350> that

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
just increased by one piece so do that

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.590 
just increased by one piece so do that
to<00:03:06.650> the<00:03:06.739> other<00:03:06.769> side<00:03:06.980> put<00:03:07.819> on<00:03:07.940> one<00:03:08.120> piece<00:03:08.329> with

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
to the other side put on one piece with

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:15.339 
to the other side put on one piece with
one<00:03:08.780> pocket<00:03:13.389> so<00:03:14.389> you've<00:03:14.510> got<00:03:14.660> one<00:03:14.810> extra<00:03:15.170> here

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:15.349 
one pocket so you've got one extra here

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:17.080 
one pocket so you've got one extra here
and<00:03:15.560> one<00:03:15.739> extra<00:03:16.040> here<00:03:16.280> so<00:03:16.549> if<00:03:16.670> added<00:03:16.910> two<00:03:17.060> extra

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
and one extra here so if added two extra

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.660 
and one extra here so if added two extra
pieces<00:03:17.569> so<00:03:18.290> now<00:03:18.410> instead<00:03:18.560> of<00:03:18.829> 14<00:03:19.190> this<00:03:19.459> is<00:03:19.639> a

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
pieces so now instead of 14 this is a

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.550 
pieces so now instead of 14 this is a
row<00:03:19.849> of<00:03:19.880> 16<00:03:20.420> so<00:03:21.049> you're<00:03:21.139> going<00:03:21.260> to<00:03:21.319> do<00:03:21.440> this

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
row of 16 so you're going to do this

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.890 
row of 16 so you're going to do this
again<00:03:21.739> two<00:03:22.250> more<00:03:22.489> times<00:03:22.700> so<00:03:23.030> just<00:03:23.420> go<00:03:23.540> next<00:03:23.690> to

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
again two more times so just go next to

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.530 
again two more times so just go next to
it<00:03:24.040> remove<00:03:25.040> this<00:03:25.190> piece<00:03:25.430> in<00:03:25.940> put<00:03:26.269> on<00:03:26.299> two

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
it remove this piece in put on two

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:43.910 
it remove this piece in put on two
pieces<00:03:26.959> with<00:03:27.169> one<00:03:27.349> point

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:47.339 

so<00:03:44.920> now<00:03:45.069> we've<00:03:45.280> added<00:03:45.520> four<00:03:45.940> extra<00:03:46.209> pieces<00:03:46.420> so

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
so now we've added four extra pieces so

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:51.060 
so now we've added four extra pieces so
it's<00:03:47.470> gone<00:03:47.620> from<00:03:47.830> a<00:03:47.980> row<00:03:48.129> of<00:03:48.310> 14<00:03:48.730> to<00:03:48.879> 18
