00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.400 

all<00:02:22.240> right<00:02:22.390> as<00:02:22.510> you<00:02:22.569> can<00:02:22.630> see<00:02:22.900> this<00:02:23.080> plate

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
all right as you can see this plate

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.890 
all right as you can see this plate
isn't<00:02:24.310> completely<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.880> same<00:02:25.120> this<00:02:25.660> has<00:02:25.870> a

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
isn't completely the same this has a

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:33.800 
isn't completely the same this has a
higher<00:02:26.170> standoff<00:02:26.770> here<00:02:29.790> also<00:02:30.790> I<00:02:30.819> got<00:02:31.709> this<00:02:32.709> to

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
higher standoff here also I got this to

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.570 
higher standoff here also I got this to
the<00:02:34.810> hand<00:02:35.110> wheel<00:02:35.290> goes<00:02:35.560> over<00:02:35.800> here<00:02:36.099> or<00:02:36.370> there's

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
the hand wheel goes over here or there's

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.059 
the hand wheel goes over here or there's
a<00:02:36.730> small<00:02:37.120> step<00:02:37.450> not<00:02:38.319> sure<00:02:38.530> if<00:02:38.620> you<00:02:38.739> can<00:02:38.860> see

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
a small step not sure if you can see

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:40.910 
a small step not sure if you can see
that<00:02:39.250> there<00:02:39.489> you<00:02:39.910> see<00:02:40.120> there<00:02:40.300> you<00:02:40.420> go

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
that there you see there you go

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.949 
that there you see there you go
that<00:02:41.920> goes<00:02:42.160> there<00:02:45.420> it's<00:02:46.420> something<00:02:46.540> pretty

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
that goes there it's something pretty

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:54.780 
that goes there it's something pretty
good<00:02:47.170> I<00:02:49.800> have<00:02:50.800> to<00:02:50.860> say<00:02:50.950> in<00:02:51.250> that<00:02:51.340> little<00:02:53.790> snot

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
good I have to say in that little snot

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:00.259 
good I have to say in that little snot
ball<00:02:55.030> for<00:02:55.269> there<00:02:55.450> actually<00:02:56.290> I<00:02:56.319> just<00:02:56.380> cut<00:02:56.739> it

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.970 

not<00:03:01.269> sure<00:03:01.480> if<00:03:01.540> he<00:03:01.660> don't<00:03:02.260> lip<00:03:02.470> there<00:03:02.709> that's

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
not sure if he don't lip there that's

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:20.199 
not sure if he don't lip there that's
from<00:03:03.250> where<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:03.580> layers<00:03:04.440> connect

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.020 

okay<00:03:21.209> it's<00:03:21.599> good

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
okay it's good

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.110 
okay it's good
spins<00:03:24.030> freely<00:03:24.300> and<00:03:24.599> then<00:03:24.720> this<00:03:24.870> goes<00:03:25.170> on<00:03:25.500> here

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
spins freely and then this goes on here

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:33.040 
spins freely and then this goes on here
like<00:03:27.120> so

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.150 

I<00:03:33.140> didn't<00:03:33.800> put<00:03:33.950> the<00:03:34.070> caps<00:03:34.370> on<00:03:35.770> hopefully<00:03:36.770> it

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
I didn't put the caps on hopefully it

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.260 
I didn't put the caps on hopefully it
will<00:03:37.250> fit<00:03:37.550> yep<00:03:38.920> it's<00:03:39.920> just<00:03:40.190> barely<00:03:40.790> a<00:03:40.940> press

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.270 
will fit yep it's just barely a press

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:51.070 
will fit yep it's just barely a press
fit<00:03:41.540> okay<00:03:45.430> give<00:03:46.430> it<00:03:46.460> a<00:03:46.580> shot<00:03:49.360> see<00:03:50.360> that<00:03:50.570> spins

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
fit okay give it a shot see that spins

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.630 
fit okay give it a shot see that spins
around<00:03:51.200> the<00:03:51.710> pin<00:03:51.920> goes<00:03:52.190> in<00:03:52.430> the<00:03:52.550> COG<00:03:52.850> ear<00:03:54.640> the

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
around the pin goes in the COG ear the

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:03.190 
around the pin goes in the COG ear the
whole<00:03:57.340> assembly<00:03:58.340> rotates<00:03:58.760> around<00:03:58.910> on<00:03:59.650> 360<00:04:02.200> and

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
whole assembly rotates around on 360 and

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.170 
whole assembly rotates around on 360 and
it<00:04:03.500> moves<00:04:03.770> again<00:04:04.630> takes<00:04:05.630> four<00:04:06.880> revolutions<00:04:07.880> of

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
it moves again takes four revolutions of

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.620 
it moves again takes four revolutions of
the<00:04:08.750> hand<00:04:09.110> wheel<00:04:09.320> to<00:04:10.160> move<00:04:10.610> the<00:04:10.880> COG<00:04:11.150> around

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
the hand wheel to move the COG around

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:29.250 
the hand wheel to move the COG around
once<00:04:25.930> also<00:04:26.930> works<00:04:27.200> in<00:04:27.380> the<00:04:27.410> universes<00:04:27.950> away

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
once also works in the universes away

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:51.280 
once also works in the universes away
you<00:04:30.260> see<00:04:30.440> here's<00:04:30.710> to<00:04:30.920> spin<00:04:31.250> this<00:04:50.140> as<00:04:51.140> you<00:04:51.260> can

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
you see here's to spin this as you can

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:54.520 
you see here's to spin this as you can
see<00:04:51.380> the<00:04:52.040> moves<00:04:52.340> really<00:04:52.520> fast<00:04:53.380> when<00:04:54.380> it

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
see the moves really fast when it

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.790 
see the moves really fast when it
does<00:04:54.710> spin

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.369 

all<00:04:58.370> right<00:04:58.550> that<00:04:58.789> concludes<00:04:58.940> the<00:04:59.690> Geneva

00:05:00.369 --> 00:05:00.379 
all right that concludes the Geneva

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:04.240 
all right that concludes the Geneva
wheel<00:05:01.330> from<00:05:02.330> print<00:05:02.840> to<00:05:02.930> 3d<00:05:03.710> and<00:05:03.740> as<00:05:04.039> you<00:05:04.129> can

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
wheel from print to 3d and as you can

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:13.860 
wheel from print to 3d and as you can
see<00:05:04.460> I<00:05:04.490> have<00:05:04.819> my<00:05:05.090> website<00:05:07.360> left<00:05:08.360> wheel
