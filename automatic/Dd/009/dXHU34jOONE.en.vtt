00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:08.370
 hello I introduce myself morgan parra 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.960
 is this game monitor fishing guide the 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.360
 house of fishing and nature 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.460
 today we will see how snow 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.070
 that is, how do you hang on 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.830
 the hook the main fishing zappa 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.260
 so we'll have everything 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:27.180
 put the tears of Diptera so we 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.250
 esti legal hours li ping who what will 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.759
 to become flies 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:37.760
 we will see how to hang more who will 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.760
 to be earthworms and corn 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.149
 corn is a stilts and fragile so 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.640
 we will try to prick the best 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.730
 possible while camouflaging the hook to 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.969
 the inside just make a tiny 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.489
 little past the tip of the hook 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.890
 says that the fish will bite at the moment 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.800
 where you are going to shoe the corn grain is going 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.140
 jump and the fish will explain everything 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.879
 alone at the level of the earthworms 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.780
 well then we will do what is called 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.400
 put them to avoid that they 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.659
 pulls out of the hook too easily 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.210
 we're going to go sting not far from the head 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:18.270
 or from there that does not matter the meaning and we 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.360
 will come and put them on the hook for 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.189
 hide the house inside and then 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.670
 we 'll just let out the tip of 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.710
 the hook is covered with the 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.079
 body of the earthworm the nose of 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.650
 the hook at the level of the maggots 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:37.290
 it is a hunt is solid we will come 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.320
 put on the maggots taking the 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.960
 minimum possible pau in order to 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.180
 attach to the hook while leaving a 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.670
 soul are the freest possible 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.340
 the goal being that when the punch goes 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.530
 come bite he'll get stung by himself 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.990
 on the hook there will be more than 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.110
 iron in conclusion the esh the most 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.149
 used on usually the maggot which 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.799
 is very expensive and on the targets at all 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.380
 the world for all that will be small 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.140
 fish are going to be very suitable as well as 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.460
 for the big ones and for dispatch we're going 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.260
 rather sought after 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.560
 kind a little bigger are the most 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:16.280
 patients the corn and the werder is going to be 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.280
 very suitable
