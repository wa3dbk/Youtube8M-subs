so<00:00:03.600> I<00:00:03.629> know<00:00:03.720> he<00:00:03.899> gets<00:00:04.080> old<00:00:04.230> tune<00:00:04.799> in<00:00:04.920> to<00:00:05.040> watch

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
so I know he gets old tune in to watch

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.880 
so I know he gets old tune in to watch
my<00:00:05.400> stove<00:00:05.670> videos<00:00:06.150> and<00:00:06.480> I<00:00:07.109> really<00:00:07.620> enjoy<00:00:07.799> doing

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
my stove videos and I really enjoy doing

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.160 
my stove videos and I really enjoy doing
the<00:00:08.189> stoves<00:00:08.429> but<00:00:08.700> the<00:00:09.599> other<00:00:09.719> day<00:00:09.870> I<00:00:09.900> was<00:00:10.110> a

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
the stoves but the other day I was a

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.999 
the stoves but the other day I was a
mess<00:00:11.010> around<00:00:11.130> work<00:00:11.460> and<00:00:12.000> we<00:00:12.330> had<00:00:12.540> three<00:00:13.080> line

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
mess around work and we had three line

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.519 
mess around work and we had three line
printers<00:00:14.549> that<00:00:14.820> were<00:00:14.969> left<00:00:15.240> and<00:00:15.509> there<00:00:16.350> he

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
printers that were left and there he

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.760 
printers that were left and there he
tossed<00:00:16.800> so<00:00:17.460> I<00:00:17.940> got<00:00:18.539> on<00:00:18.660> lying<00:00:18.900> that's<00:00:19.350> awesome

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
tossed so I got on lying that's awesome

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.650 
tossed so I got on lying that's awesome
stuff<00:00:19.859> where<00:00:20.189> you<00:00:20.279> can<00:00:20.400> use<00:00:20.699> a<00:00:20.730> stepper<00:00:21.359> motor

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
stuff where you can use a stepper motor

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.550 
stuff where you can use a stepper motor
to<00:00:23.090> make<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.800> CNC<00:00:25.800> lathe<00:00:26.000> now<00:00:27.000> I'm<00:00:27.449> not<00:00:28.140> sure<00:00:28.170> to

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
to make a CNC lathe now I'm not sure to

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.200 
to make a CNC lathe now I'm not sure to
what<00:00:28.680> degree<00:00:28.830> I'm<00:00:29.070> going<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.279> take<00:00:29.400> this<00:00:29.580> but<00:00:29.939> I

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
what degree I'm going to take this but I

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.380 
what degree I'm going to take this but I
thought<00:00:30.750> I'd<00:00:30.869> give<00:00:30.900> it<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.170> try<00:00:31.199> so<00:00:31.560> I<00:00:31.619> have<00:00:31.859> a

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
thought I'd give it a try so I have a

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:40.910 
thought I'd give it a try so I have a
couple<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.570> these<00:00:33.630> step<00:00:33.899> motors<00:00:34.260> one<00:00:36.739> too<00:00:39.920> and

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
couple of these step motors one too and

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.760 
couple of these step motors one too and
there's<00:00:41.670> one<00:00:41.790> here<00:00:41.969> which<00:00:42.210> makes<00:00:42.420> three<00:00:42.780> I<00:00:43.020> do

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
there's one here which makes three I do

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.340 
there's one here which makes three I do
not<00:00:44.100> think<00:00:44.370> this<00:00:44.640> is<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.879> stepper<00:00:45.149> motor<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:46.230> was

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
not think this is a stepper motor it was

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.709 
not think this is a stepper motor it was
a<00:00:46.410> very<00:00:46.559> large<00:00:46.739> motor<00:00:46.980> inside<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.670> printer

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
a very large motor inside the printer

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.389 
a very large motor inside the printer
I<00:00:48.780> don't<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.590> can<00:00:49.620> feel<00:00:49.920> it's<00:00:50.070> definitely

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
I don't you can feel it's definitely

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.740 
I don't you can feel it's definitely
generally<00:00:50.789> when<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.090> twist<00:00:51.329> them<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.570> this

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
generally when you twist them and this

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.810 
generally when you twist them and this
one's<00:00:51.930> not<00:00:52.079> giving<00:00:52.559> any<00:00:52.710> kind<00:00:52.890> of<00:00:52.949> steps<00:00:53.219> so<00:00:53.789> I

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
one's not giving any kind of steps so I

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.700 
one's not giving any kind of steps so I
think<00:00:53.910> this<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.120> just<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.449> run<00:00:54.629> motor<00:00:54.870> may<00:00:55.500> come

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
think this is just a run motor may come

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.510 
think this is just a run motor may come
in<00:00:55.800> handy<00:00:55.829> for<00:00:56.070> something<00:00:56.129> I'm<00:00:56.399> not<00:00:56.460> really

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
in handy for something I'm not really

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.229 
in handy for something I'm not really
sure<00:00:56.789> what<00:00:56.940> its<00:00:57.090> far<00:00:58.699> way<00:00:59.699> there's<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.000> lot<00:01:00.120> of

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
sure what its far way there's a lot of

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.569 
sure what its far way there's a lot of
little<00:01:00.449> stepper<00:01:00.750> motors<00:01:01.079> as<00:01:01.230> well<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.649> little

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
little stepper motors as well a little

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.429 
little stepper motors as well a little
bitty<00:01:02.850> ones<00:01:03.059> for<00:01:03.390> stuff<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:04.019> those<00:01:04.140> are

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
bitty ones for stuff and those are

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.070 
bitty ones for stuff and those are
cooking<00:01:05.250> light<00:01:05.460> but<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.299> big<00:01:06.780> thing<00:01:06.990> I'm

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
cooking light but the big thing I'm

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.210 
cooking light but the big thing I'm
working<00:01:07.260> on

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
working on

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.420 
working on
besides<00:01:09.180> how<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.810> make<00:01:10.020> one<00:01:10.200> of<00:01:10.290> these<00:01:10.430> CNC

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
besides how to make one of these CNC

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.050 
besides how to make one of these CNC
lathes<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.570> what<00:01:12.810> what<00:01:13.290> route<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.619> go<00:01:14.060> then

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
lathes and what what route to go then

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.219 
lathes and what what route to go then
doing<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.270> little<00:01:15.299> look<00:01:15.570> in<00:01:15.689> there<00:01:15.840> some<00:01:16.080> that

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
doing a little look in there some that

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.749 
doing a little look in there some that
are<00:01:16.290> run<00:01:16.439> by<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:17.250> band<00:01:17.490> I'm<00:01:18.060> going<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.299> run<00:01:18.450> by

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
are run by the band I'm going to run by

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:24.590 
are run by the band I'm going to run by
threaded<00:01:20.759> rods<00:01:22.009> and<00:01:23.009> other<00:01:23.310> things<00:01:23.610> so<00:01:24.330> some

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
threaded rods and other things so some

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.270 
threaded rods and other things so some
other<00:01:24.720> just<00:01:24.900> on<00:01:24.990> bearings<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.890> go<00:01:26.009> back<00:01:26.159> and

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
other just on bearings to go back and

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.319 
other just on bearings to go back and
forth<00:01:26.430> any<00:01:27.240> way<00:01:27.330> that<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:27.630> start<00:01:27.900> off<00:01:28.020> with<00:01:28.259> the

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329 
forth any way that I start off with the

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:31.880 
forth any way that I start off with the
obviously<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.420> piece<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.110> got<00:01:31.140> from<00:01:31.680> the

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
obviously the piece that I got from the

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.969 
obviously the piece that I got from the
printer<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.670> was<00:01:32.759> well<00:01:33.170> if<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.229> look<00:01:34.770> here

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
printer that was well if you look here

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.830 
printer that was well if you look here
you<00:01:35.100> can<00:01:35.220> see<00:01:35.369> that<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.610> has<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:36.360> cartridge<00:01:36.750> that

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
you can see that it has a cartridge that

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.260 
you can see that it has a cartridge that
goes<00:01:37.049> back<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.439> forth<00:01:37.650> for<00:01:37.950> printing<00:01:38.340> and

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
goes back and forth for printing and

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.020 
goes back and forth for printing and
that's<00:01:39.829> the<00:01:40.829> stepper<00:01:41.100> motor<00:01:41.220> in<00:01:41.460> there<00:01:41.610> run<00:01:41.909> by

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
that's the stepper motor in there run by

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.740 
that's the stepper motor in there run by
that<00:01:42.210> one<00:01:42.329> now<00:01:42.560> so<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.740> lets<00:01:44.009> me<00:01:44.750> control

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
that one now so that lets me control

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.639 
that one now so that lets me control
left<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.770> right<00:01:47.009> our<00:01:47.250> X<00:01:47.610> access<00:01:48.320> so<00:01:49.320> I<00:01:49.350> was

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
left to right our X access so I was

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.789 
left to right our X access so I was
thinking<00:01:49.950> maybe<00:01:50.040> bolt<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.549> board<00:01:50.909> down<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.329> this

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
thinking maybe bolt a board down to this

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:54.170 
thinking maybe bolt a board down to this
frame<00:01:52.799> this<00:01:52.979> out<00:01:53.189> somehow<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.729> hold<00:01:53.880> on<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.149> it

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
frame this out somehow and hold on to it

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.969 
frame this out somehow and hold on to it
pull<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.960> board<00:01:55.170> under<00:01:55.320> here<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.619> that<00:01:55.710> we<00:01:55.799> can

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
pull to board under here and that we can

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.370 
pull to board under here and that we can
make<00:01:56.630> XY<00:01:57.630> on<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.930> X<00:01:58.140> access<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:59.159> then<00:01:59.969> I

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
make XY on the X access and then I

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.139 
make XY on the X access and then I
figured<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.530> would<00:02:01.560> work<00:02:01.950> on<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.610> next<00:02:02.909> step

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
figured I would work on the next step

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.539 
figured I would work on the next step
which<00:02:03.360> would<00:02:03.390> be<00:02:03.570> you<00:02:04.560> know<00:02:04.680> one<00:02:04.920> over<00:02:05.159> on<00:02:05.280> this

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
which would be you know one over on this

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.010 
which would be you know one over on this
side<00:02:05.610> running<00:02:06.540> this<00:02:06.810> way<00:02:07.049> giving<00:02:08.009> me<00:02:08.810> my<00:02:09.810> y

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
side running this way giving me my y

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.250 
side running this way giving me my y
axis<00:02:10.050> going<00:02:10.679> this<00:02:10.860> way

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
axis going this way

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.110 
axis going this way
the<00:02:11.500> motor<00:02:11.680> would<00:02:11.890> move<00:02:12.129> the<00:02:14.730> band<00:02:15.730> or

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
the motor would move the band or

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.780 
the motor would move the band or
whatever<00:02:16.659> I<00:02:16.810> connected<00:02:17.170> to<00:02:17.200> remove<00:02:17.620> this<00:02:18.580> band

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
whatever I connected to remove this band

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.479 
whatever I connected to remove this band
extra<00:02:19.150> is<00:02:19.209> made<00:02:19.420> for<00:02:19.659> this<00:02:19.810> and<00:02:20.349> it<00:02:21.129> runs<00:02:21.310> this

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
extra is made for this and it runs this

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:25.170 
extra is made for this and it runs this
way<00:02:21.670> and<00:02:22.540> it<00:02:22.659> ran<00:02:22.870> with<00:02:23.200> I<00:02:23.760> had<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:24.849> other<00:02:24.940> part

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
way and it ran with I had the other part

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.220 
way and it ran with I had the other part
here<00:02:26.159> and<00:02:27.159> that<00:02:27.489> ran<00:02:27.640> like<00:02:27.819> that<00:02:28.230> so

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
here and that ran like that so

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.690 
here and that ran like that so
potentially<00:02:29.680> I<00:02:29.739> could<00:02:29.860> attach<00:02:30.069> that<00:02:30.370> to<00:02:30.430> a

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
potentially I could attach that to a

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.550 
potentially I could attach that to a
cartridge<00:02:31.180> of<00:02:31.360> some<00:02:31.540> kind<00:02:31.780> or<00:02:31.930> carriage<00:02:32.379> and

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
cartridge of some kind or carriage and

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.649 
cartridge of some kind or carriage and
run<00:02:35.560> it<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:37.480> y-axis<00:02:38.340> given<00:02:39.340> my<00:02:39.579> XY<00:02:40.209> axis

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:40.659 
run it the y-axis given my XY axis

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:42.569 
run it the y-axis given my XY axis
obviously<00:02:41.079> there's<00:02:41.260> some<00:02:41.470> uh<00:02:41.620> controller

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 
obviously there's some uh controller

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:44.339 
obviously there's some uh controller
boards<00:02:42.940> that<00:02:43.030> have<00:02:43.209> to<00:02:43.329> be<00:02:43.360> built<00:02:43.989> to<00:02:44.230> these

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
boards that have to be built to these

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:46.380 
boards that have to be built to these

unless your hoes work I gotta do a lot

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:47.880 
unless your hoes work I gotta do a lot
of<00:02:46.450> research<00:02:46.660> on<00:02:47.019> this<00:02:47.110> and<00:02:47.170> see<00:02:47.440> how<00:02:47.680> these

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
of research on this and see how these

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.819 
of research on this and see how these
things<00:02:47.950> work<00:02:48.430> these<00:02:48.670> stepper<00:02:48.970> motors

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
things work these stepper motors

others I went to the mine be mine be I'm
never<00:03:37.569> was<00:03:37.720> your<00:03:37.840> husband<00:03:38.169> off<00:03:38.230> the<00:03:38.410> site<00:03:39.040> and

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
never was your husband off the site and

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.500 
never was your husband off the site and
it<00:03:39.819> gives<00:03:40.030> you<00:03:40.180> all<00:03:40.299> the<00:03:41.700> torque<00:03:42.700> information

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
it gives you all the torque information

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.170 
it gives you all the torque information
and<00:03:43.750> speed<00:03:44.049> and<00:03:44.230> all<00:03:44.349> that<00:03:44.530> so<00:03:45.430> because<00:03:45.880> you<00:03:46.060> do

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
and speed and all that so because you do

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.550 
and speed and all that so because you do
have<00:03:46.329> to<00:03:46.419> have<00:03:46.450> a<00:03:46.569> controller<00:03:46.989> motor<00:03:47.260> to<00:03:47.410> run

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
have to have a controller motor to run

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.150 
have to have a controller motor to run
these<00:03:47.769> and<00:03:48.130> I<00:03:48.160> don't<00:03:48.700> have<00:03:48.940> the<00:03:49.299> controller

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
these and I don't have the controller

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.860 
these and I don't have the controller
controller<00:03:51.160> to<00:03:51.340> run<00:03:51.400> these<00:03:51.639> motors<00:03:52.120> so<00:03:52.780> I've

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
controller to run these motors so I've

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.780 
controller to run these motors so I've
got<00:03:53.049> to<00:03:53.139> build<00:03:53.319> that<00:03:53.410> controller<00:03:53.889> these<00:03:54.519> are

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
got to build that controller these are

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.610 
got to build that controller these are
all<00:03:55.030> for<00:03:56.019> wire<00:03:56.879> stepper<00:03:57.879> motors<00:03:58.329> and<00:03:58.660> I<00:03:59.349> have

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
all for wire stepper motors and I have

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.150 
all for wire stepper motors and I have
three<00:04:00.160> more<00:04:00.400> of<00:04:00.459> these<00:04:00.700> at<00:04:01.629> work<00:04:01.989> actually<00:04:02.290> I

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
three more of these at work actually I

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:10.979 
three more of these at work actually I
have<00:04:05.790> these<00:04:07.169> these<00:04:08.169> -<00:04:08.500> no<00:04:08.829> I<00:04:09.099> have<00:04:09.540> one<00:04:10.540> so<00:04:10.720> ESEs

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
have these these - no I have one so ESEs

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:14.819 
have these these - no I have one so ESEs
when<00:04:11.139> I<00:04:11.169> have<00:04:13.019> three<00:04:14.019> more<00:04:14.199> these<00:04:14.379> at<00:04:14.500> work<00:04:14.650> I

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 
when I have three more these at work I

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:17.189 
when I have three more these at work I
can't<00:04:15.069> remember<00:04:15.190> which<00:04:15.370> ones<00:04:15.609> I<00:04:15.699> have<00:04:16.199> so

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:17.199 
can't remember which ones I have so

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:19.649 
can't remember which ones I have so
anyway<00:04:17.530> couple<00:04:18.519> more<00:04:18.669> don't<00:04:18.849> we<00:04:18.970> work<00:04:19.150> as<00:04:19.390> you

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:19.659 
anyway couple more don't we work as you

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:20.520 
anyway couple more don't we work as you
still<00:04:19.870> have<00:04:19.959> to<00:04:20.049> take<00:04:20.169> the<00:04:20.349> piece<00:04:20.500> of

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
still have to take the piece of

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.520 
still have to take the piece of
equipment<00:04:20.709> apart<00:04:21.310> to<00:04:21.579> get<00:04:21.760> to<00:04:21.940> them

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
equipment apart to get to them

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.470 
equipment apart to get to them
I<00:04:22.560> don't<00:04:22.770> have<00:04:22.860> them<00:04:22.980> yet<00:04:23.520> I<00:04:23.580> still<00:04:24.150> have<00:04:24.300> to

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:24.480 
I don't have them yet I still have to
