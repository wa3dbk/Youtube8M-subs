thing that you can ever learn is your

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.780 
thing that you can ever learn is your
major<00:00:51.470> scale<00:00:53.860> most<00:00:54.860> of<00:00:55.010> the<00:00:55.070> Western<00:00:55.430> music

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:55.790 
major scale most of the Western music

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.750 
major scale most of the Western music
that<00:00:55.970> we<00:00:56.120> hear<00:00:56.150> comes<00:00:56.809> from<00:00:57.140> that<00:00:57.379> and<00:00:57.860> once

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
that we hear comes from that and once

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.579 
that we hear comes from that and once
you<00:00:58.879> can<00:00:59.089> get<00:00:59.150> understanding<00:00:59.989> of<00:01:00.080> that<00:01:00.229> scale

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:00.589 
you can get understanding of that scale

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:02.860 
you can get understanding of that scale
and<00:01:00.620> the<00:01:00.920> modes<00:01:01.129> inside<00:01:01.580> of<00:01:01.760> it<00:01:01.879> and<00:01:02.180> you<00:01:02.780> know

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
and the modes inside of it and you know

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.149 
and the modes inside of it and you know
be<00:01:03.170> able<00:01:03.290> to<00:01:03.379> understand<00:01:03.830> them<00:01:03.920> in<00:01:04.010> different

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
be able to understand them in different

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.740 
be able to understand them in different
degrees<00:01:06.159> you<00:01:07.159> can<00:01:07.370> move<00:01:07.610> that<00:01:07.850> pattern<00:01:08.540> around

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
degrees you can move that pattern around

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.870 
degrees you can move that pattern around
your<00:01:09.320> neck<00:01:09.560> and<00:01:09.800> you're<00:01:09.920> done<00:01:10.100> it's<00:01:10.310> all<00:01:10.549> the

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
your neck and you're done it's all the

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.510 
your neck and you're done it's all the
same<00:01:11.120> it's<00:01:11.540> all<00:01:11.620> the<00:01:12.620> same<00:01:12.890> you<00:01:13.190> know<00:01:13.220> I<00:01:13.340> mean

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
same it's all the same you know I mean

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.640 
same it's all the same you know I mean
so<00:01:13.760> what<00:01:14.450> we<00:01:14.540> have<00:01:14.750> here<00:01:14.780> if<00:01:15.229> you<00:01:15.320> think<00:01:15.560> of

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:15.650 
so what we have here if you think of

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.160 
so what we have here if you think of
your<00:01:15.799> major<00:01:16.010> scale<00:01:16.430> as<00:01:16.729> your<00:01:17.270> parent<00:01:17.840> scale

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
your major scale as your parent scale

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.320 
your major scale as your parent scale
and<00:01:18.860> it<00:01:19.010> has<00:01:19.190> seven<00:01:19.670> tones<00:01:19.940> and<00:01:20.210> each<00:01:20.330> steps

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.470 

now<00:01:23.860> lay<00:01:24.860> the<00:01:24.890> G<00:01:25.160> twice<00:01:25.430> or<00:01:25.700> dat<00:01:25.970> twice<00:01:26.240> doesn't

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:26.480 
now lay the G twice or dat twice doesn't

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.420 
now lay the G twice or dat twice doesn't
matter<00:01:26.780> what<00:01:26.990> key<00:01:27.200> were<00:01:27.410> in<00:01:27.500> because<00:01:28.100> we<00:01:28.250> need

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
matter what key were in because we need

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.160 
matter what key were in because we need
to<00:01:28.520> hear<00:01:28.670> that<00:01:28.850> closure<00:01:29.150> but<00:01:29.480> what<00:01:29.630> we<00:01:29.750> have<00:01:29.930> is

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
to hear that closure but what we have is

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.420 
to hear that closure but what we have is
seven<00:01:30.710> points<00:01:31.040> on<00:01:31.100> each<00:01:31.250> set<00:01:32.860> each<00:01:33.860> one<00:01:33.920> of

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
seven points on each set each one of

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.560 
seven points on each set each one of
these<00:01:34.550> notes<00:01:35.110> as<00:01:36.110> a<00:01:36.170> scale<00:01:37.450> because<00:01:38.450> the

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
these notes as a scale because the

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.210 
these notes as a scale because the
parent<00:01:38.930> scale<00:01:39.080> has<00:01:39.350> seven<00:01:39.770> thousand<00:01:40.130> eight

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
parent scale has seven thousand eight

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.020 
parent scale has seven thousand eight
steps<00:01:40.550> each<00:01:41.000> one<00:01:41.330> has<00:01:41.570> to<00:01:41.750> have<00:01:41.960> that<00:01:42.200> so<00:01:43.100> what

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
steps each one has to have that so what

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.090 
steps each one has to have that so what
you<00:01:44.210> got<00:01:44.450> there<00:01:44.750> is<00:01:45.020> a<00:01:45.700> pattern<00:01:47.530> up<00:01:48.530> your<00:01:48.860> next

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
you got there is a pattern up your next

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.370 
you got there is a pattern up your next
four<00:01:49.340> across<00:01:49.640> adapt<00:01:50.090> or<00:01:50.330> die<00:01:50.390> a<00:01:50.690> me<00:01:51.110> what<00:01:51.230> you

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
four across adapt or die a me what you

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.200 
four across adapt or die a me what you
want<00:01:51.650> now

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
want now

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.930 
want now
I've<00:01:53.210> loaded<00:01:53.480> a<00:01:53.660> really<00:01:54.020> rough<00:01:54.230> chart<00:01:54.590> on<00:01:55.190> my

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
I've loaded a really rough chart on my

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.990 
I've loaded a really rough chart on my
myspace<00:01:56.150> license<00:01:56.870> and<00:01:57.520> it's<00:01:58.520> right<00:01:58.730> there<00:01:58.970> you

myspace license and it's right there you
can<00:01:59.300> have<00:01:59.450> a<00:01:59.510> look<00:01:59.630> at<00:01:59.810> it<00:01:59.900> and<00:02:00.020> go<00:02:00.110> see<00:02:00.170> it<00:02:00.410> and

can have a look at it and go see it and

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.620 
can have a look at it and go see it and
what<00:02:01.130> I've<00:02:01.280> got<00:02:01.490> there<00:02:01.730> is<00:02:01.790> a<00:02:02.090> little<00:02:02.450> bit<00:02:02.540> of

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
what I've got there is a little bit of

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.570 
what I've got there is a little bit of
an<00:02:02.720> explanation<00:02:03.020> about<00:02:03.320> how<00:02:03.650> you<00:02:03.980> can<00:02:04.310> tie

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
an explanation about how you can tie

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.230 
an explanation about how you can tie
knowing<00:02:05.510> your<00:02:05.660> molds<00:02:06.400> into<00:02:07.400> understanding

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
knowing your molds into understanding

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.490 
knowing your molds into understanding
your<00:02:08.330> nothing<00:02:08.720> feeling<00:02:09.020> really<00:02:09.230> comfortable

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
your nothing feeling really comfortable

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.160 
your nothing feeling really comfortable
but<00:02:10.010> because<00:02:10.399> it's<00:02:10.580> all<00:02:10.880> about<00:02:11.330> patterns

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
but because it's all about patterns

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.680 
but because it's all about patterns
so<00:02:12.830> if<00:02:13.130> you<00:02:13.280> notice<00:02:13.580> though<00:02:13.730> on<00:02:13.940> that<00:02:14.270> sheet<00:02:14.570> on

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
so if you notice though on that sheet on

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.210 
so if you notice though on that sheet on
how<00:02:14.840> to<00:02:14.900> assign<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:16.400> modes<00:02:16.640> to<00:02:16.850> any<00:02:17.030> key<00:02:18.220> the

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
how to assign the modes to any key the

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.280 
how to assign the modes to any key the
longer<00:02:19.580> to<00:02:19.640> do<00:02:19.730> is<00:02:19.850> working<00:02:20.240> on<00:02:20.360> a<00:02:20.390> G<00:02:20.690> okay

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
longer to do is working on a G okay

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.040 
longer to do is working on a G okay
now<00:02:22.130> if<00:02:22.880> you<00:02:23.000> look<00:02:23.240> at<00:02:23.390> you<00:02:23.570> can<00:02:23.720> see<00:02:23.930> around

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
now if you look at you can see around

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.640 
now if you look at you can see around
the<00:02:24.290> other<00:02:24.770> edges<00:02:25.310> is<00:02:25.460> a<00:02:26.260> physical<00:02:27.260> pattern

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
the other edges is a physical pattern

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.940 
the other edges is a physical pattern
between<00:02:27.920> two<00:02:28.850> restraints<00:02:29.420> so<00:02:30.140> if<00:02:30.470> you<00:02:30.590> notice

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
between two restraints so if you notice

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:38.560 
between two restraints so if you notice
a<00:02:31.300> b<00:02:32.300> b<00:02:32.630> c<00:02:33.530> c<00:02:34.160> DD<00:02:34.940> well<00:02:35.420> what<00:02:35.600> those<00:02:35.810> are<00:02:36.050> is<00:02:37.570> now

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
a b b c c DD well what those are is now

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.949 
a b b c c DD well what those are is now
the<00:02:38.630> patterns

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
the patterns

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:46.180 
the patterns
interlocked<00:02:41.959> between<00:02:42.440> each<00:02:42.560> other<00:02:45.190> there's

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
interlocked between each other there's

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:57.460 
interlocked between each other there's
no<00:02:49.450> next<00:02:50.450> one<00:02:50.690> moves<00:02:51.230> up<00:02:51.409> see<00:02:55.930> how<00:02:56.930> they<00:02:57.110> all<00:02:57.290> in

there's there's my the best thing about
them<00:03:44.670> is<00:03:44.700> once<00:03:45.030> you<00:03:45.120> can<00:03:45.329> understand<00:03:45.870> that<00:03:45.989> of

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
them is once you can understand that of

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.190 
them is once you can understand that of
the<00:03:47.280> whole<00:03:47.459> idea<00:03:47.610> of<00:03:47.790> modes<00:03:48.120> and<00:03:48.360> that<00:03:48.420> concept

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
the whole idea of modes and that concept

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.800 
the whole idea of modes and that concept
like<00:03:49.980> it<00:03:50.129> goes<00:03:50.310> on<00:03:50.489> for<00:03:50.760> infinity<00:03:50.879> up<00:03:51.420> and

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
like it goes on for infinity up and

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.069 
like it goes on for infinity up and
infinity<00:03:52.290> down<00:03:52.819> so<00:03:53.819> once<00:03:54.209> you<00:03:54.390> can<00:03:54.569> really<00:03:54.959> get

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
infinity down so once you can really get

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.530 
infinity down so once you can really get
a<00:03:55.140> grip<00:03:55.439> on<00:03:55.680> it<00:03:55.799> and<00:03:56.310> no<00:03:56.549> say<00:03:56.879> we're<00:03:57.180> in<00:03:57.269> a<00:03:57.359> bitch
