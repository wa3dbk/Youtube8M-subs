00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 to teach my five favorite random with 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.259
 sell the last month that tells you 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.690
 I liked it very much and I told you that I would continue 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.190
 doing them every month so today I 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.469
 teach my five favorite Landon's 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.010
 this month is a bit of last month and 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.619
 this month we are in mid -May and 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.480
 these are also from April so good 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.550
 to start to start with this from 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.010
 here that I have it next to my bed that 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:30.390
 are these little glasses that are like 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.160
 straw very interest all but really 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.920
 they are super practical because I have them 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.540
 side of the bed I do not always understand the 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.670
 I have and edited a is empty because I 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.800
 I have taken but always before sleeping 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.410
 I fill them and it's super practical because they're 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.510
 more dish to catch and drink from a glass 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.250
 for me I'm asleep every time 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.719
 I 'm going to drink water it's easier to catch 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.760
 symptoms of the straw plus that is 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.590
 super cute to decorate is to have it at 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.120
 side of the bed I have several I have 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.699
 Various colors several keeping them 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.590
 I have glass that changes the straws 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.570
 I have disposable small disposable ones 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.579
 it's plastic I have a lot of 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.430
 models and I love them and every time I see 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.190
 I buy one because 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.500
 they have also been made as basic for 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.300
 me and I love this I have it here 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.070
 I usually have a little yellow stick 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.600
 more with the bed in room but what 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.340
 I have washing so I changed it for 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.900
 this to do more things the medicinal 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.310
 I do not know what I would have to teach you because 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.100
 well it's not a medication really 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.750
 food supplement is melatonin is 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.920
 this here I will comment on several 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.860
 Sometimes I have problems for 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.270
 sleep and I was recommended to take this 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.070
 here that is something more natural than 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.660
 it really is natural what it does is like 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.180
 that balances this job a little bit 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.790
 a little bit so you fall asleep already 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.710
 it works for me very well I take one each 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.570
 night before sleep and it works 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.670
 great because I'm sleeping well I do not know 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.649
 If you notice me I have less dark circles or 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.930
 something I'm very happy since I 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.790
 he took and he's taking us every day 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.430
 It depends if there are days that I notice that I'm going to 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.140
 cost more sleep I take it or ten that 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.000
 I'm more tired I do not take it depends 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.100
 a lot but I'm doing very well that is 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.990
 for you I buy everything in pharmacies 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.330
 recipe is needed is a medicine not 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.220
 it is not a sleeping pill, much less me 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.940
 is going very well so good melatonin the 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.980
 iese of the brand here read 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.650
 and I said other things that I always have 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.560
 next to the bed see the third 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:16.650
 which are two really what are these 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:20.250
 candles here from primary this is the 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:24.420
 of the watermelon lemonade and this is the 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.340
 plate that is like watermelon apple and 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.200
 full apple lemon mine the 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.660
 I do not like lemon so much and the other two 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.480
 of those calls I ended up and I like 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.560
 because this jar can be used 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.060
 so I've saved us both 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.500
 trolleys and I'm going to reuse them for 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.870
 do some craft or to do 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.390
 something because they are super nice and good 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.010
 these are the ones that I have replaced the 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.530
 monkey because like I said it does not smell much 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.800
 These are worth 13 hours or pretty cars 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.090
 big boys and I love how it smells 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.030
 I noticed nothing for her really when the 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.740
 I bought at the first time I said good they are 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.130
 cute and maybe when they last time 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:01.890
 really smell they are super baratitas and 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.810
 they smell super well the apple and the 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.990
 watermelon well this has already started to 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.700
 burn the watermelon is amazing and it's what 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.350
 I tell you it's three euros and they're super 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.720
 well the fourth thing that I'm going to teach you 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.690
 I've had it for 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.330
 of time for at least three years or 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.700
 four years three years not much is done 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.640
 time debating what is this simple 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.400
 of longueras is called beautiful mais 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.740
 style is from this here what it is like 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.720
 a brush does not spin or anything is a brush 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.130
 of those round to do to 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.960
 comb what you have that we have to 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.790
 to do is to plug it in, I understand it 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.190
 I let it be hot as if it were a 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:40.220
 iron or this is this understood from 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.840
 here that is metal is heated and when 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.990
 it heats up I use it to mold 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.640
 mind we did not pass the iron or anything 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.920
 to make those little bugs these that we 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.620
 led today are from the iron because we 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.600
 says yesterday and they still lasted me but what 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.570
 what I'm doing is that he separated them with 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.940
 layers and I just comb my hair is like no 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:01.220
 it is to trust this here I do like this 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.350
 movement from here you see that the giants 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.560
 brush fingers and you 're going down 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:10.490
 slowly and when it reaches the tip what 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:14.450
 twist a little more and not let my hair 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:15.920
 I know with more super super nice shapes me 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.690
 leaves but with much much more volume 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.260
 that makes you look at the successes with the 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.790
 plates 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.310
 and it looks like essentially I would have 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:25.640
 hairstyle the hairdresser does not stay with a 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.200
 super nice movement and we do not go up 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.060
 I started using I said look it going 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.580
 to start using to see how and what 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:35.150
 loved it and I'm using it a lot 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.590
 for the bangs more areas and tips such 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.900
 with the fringe to leave it as more 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:40.610
 open so out that I also 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.440
 you always ask how I combed it 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.590
 normally I only know it with my little one 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.180
 I only dry it but when already for example 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.190
 I have an extra time that is drying and 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.380
 others or I want to go back to punish but only 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.660
 with giving me these warm 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.950
 I know how to return your site so it 's super 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.780
 cool I do not know how much it costs now I think 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.880
 that will be quite quite below 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.070
 of the 30 euros 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.560
 I do not want to get too close because 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.970
 a lot since I have it but it still 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.620
 you can find on the brushes that you 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.180
 warms up and we can hit with him not 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.060
 tour or anything we have to give us 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.740
 but it's super cool and last month it 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.170

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.810
