00:02:59.130 --> 00:02:59.140 
this process takes me a little while

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.870

different shape slightly so it kind of

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.920 
different shape slightly so it kind of
takes<00:03:03.400> me<00:03:03.550> a<00:03:03.580> while<00:03:03.700> to<00:03:03.760> even<00:03:04.120> the<00:03:04.180> mate<00:03:04.330> when

with a clean blending brush and then

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.220 
with a clean blending brush and then
take<00:03:09.400> something<00:03:10.150> like<00:03:10.239> charcoal<00:03:10.720> brain<00:03:10.989> which
