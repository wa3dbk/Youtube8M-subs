00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
different redstone invention this is a

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.799 
different redstone invention this is a
crazy<00:00:13.650> entrance<00:00:14.309> to<00:00:14.519> a<00:00:14.549> base<00:00:14.820> now<00:00:15.389> to<00:00:15.450> the

crazy entrance to a base now to the
untrained<00:00:16.230> eye<00:00:16.470> this<00:00:16.920> looks<00:00:17.190> like<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.369> random

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
untrained eye this looks like a random

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.730 
untrained eye this looks like a random
sand<00:00:18.180> block<00:00:18.480> and<00:00:18.690> what<00:00:18.810> is<00:00:18.900> this<00:00:19.020> random<00:00:19.289> sand

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
sand block and what is this random sand

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.370 
sand block and what is this random sand
block<00:00:20.100> of<00:00:20.250> doing<00:00:20.609> well<00:00:21.240> it's<00:00:21.449> just<00:00:21.539> bouncing

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
block of doing well it's just bouncing

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.920 
block of doing well it's just bouncing
up<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:23.250> down<00:00:23.400> but<00:00:23.880> little<00:00:24.240> did<00:00:24.420> you<00:00:24.539> know<00:00:24.689> this

enter this secret base all you have to

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.880 
enter this secret base all you have to
do<00:00:30.150> is<00:00:30.240> go<00:00:30.359> ahead<00:00:30.480> stand<00:00:30.960> in<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.439> middle<00:00:31.769> of

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
do is go ahead stand in the middle of

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.380 
do is go ahead stand in the middle of
the<00:00:31.980> sand<00:00:32.219> block<00:00:32.430> if<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:32.669> stand<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.149> side

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
the sand block if you stand to the side

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.090 
the sand block if you stand to the side
you<00:00:33.930> know<00:00:33.960> it's<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.230> normal<00:00:34.469> sand<00:00:34.710> block<00:00:34.920> it's

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
you know it's a normal sand block it's

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.530 
you know it's a normal sand block it's
not<00:00:35.219> going<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.460> do<00:00:35.610> anything<00:00:35.820> but<00:00:36.420> if<00:00:36.510> you

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
not going to do anything but if you

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.119 
not going to do anything but if you
stand<00:00:36.780> directly<00:00:37.170> in<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.590> middle<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:38.040> the

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
stand directly in the middle of the

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.459 
stand directly in the middle of the
sandbox<00:00:38.610> you'll<00:00:38.760> go<00:00:38.879> ahead<00:00:39.120> sink<00:00:39.809> inside<00:00:40.260> of

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
sandbox you'll go ahead sink inside of

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.709 
sandbox you'll go ahead sink inside of
it<00:00:40.620> and<00:00:40.770> then<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:41.399> get<00:00:41.520> pushed<00:00:41.820> into<00:00:42.180> the

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
it and then you get pushed into the

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.119 
it and then you get pushed into the
secret<00:00:43.079> base<00:00:43.260> so<00:00:43.440> this<00:00:43.590> thing's<00:00:43.829> pretty

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
secret base so this thing's pretty

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.430 
secret base so this thing's pretty
simple<00:00:44.700> it's<00:00:44.940> not<00:00:45.239> too<00:00:45.450> complicated<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.320> how

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
simple it's not too complicated and how

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.619 
simple it's not too complicated and how
it<00:00:46.590> works<00:00:46.860> it's<00:00:47.399> just<00:00:47.520> two<00:00:47.850> little<00:00:47.879> Pistons

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
it works it's just two little Pistons

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.840 
it works it's just two little Pistons

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
quick tutorial okie dokie so getting

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.580 
quick tutorial okie dokie so getting
into<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:54.120> tutorial<00:00:54.750> what<00:00:55.050> you're<00:00:55.199> gonna<00:00:55.350> want

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
into the tutorial what you're gonna want

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.830 
into the tutorial what you're gonna want
to<00:00:55.680> do<00:00:55.829> is<00:00:55.980> go<00:00:56.160> ahead<00:00:56.489> place<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:57.000> sticky<00:00:57.480> piston

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
to do is go ahead place a sticky piston

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.290 
to do is go ahead place a sticky piston
facing<00:00:58.050> sideways<00:00:58.620> piston<00:00:59.609> going<00:00:59.730> straight<00:01:00.120> up

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
facing sideways piston going straight up

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.639 
facing sideways piston going straight up
and<00:01:00.480> then<00:01:00.690> this<00:01:00.809> is<00:01:00.989> where<00:01:01.140> your<00:01:01.289> block<00:01:01.500> of

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
and then this is where your block of

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.680 
and then this is where your block of
sands<00:01:01.920> gonna<00:01:02.190> go<00:01:02.399> now<00:01:02.969> we're<00:01:03.120> gonna<00:01:03.210> go<00:01:03.420> ahead

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
sands gonna go now we're gonna go ahead

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.600 
sands gonna go now we're gonna go ahead
and<00:01:03.930> build<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.409> basic<00:01:04.619> clock<00:01:05.250> so<00:01:05.400> we're<00:01:05.519> gonna

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
and build a basic clock so we're gonna

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.030 
and build a basic clock so we're gonna
go<00:01:05.820> dot<00:01:06.299> of<00:01:06.450> redstone<00:01:06.810> dust<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.409> then<00:01:07.590> for

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
go dot of redstone dust and then for

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.820 
go dot of redstone dust and then for
repeaters<00:01:08.610> going<00:01:09.330> into<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.570> block<00:01:10.080> dot<00:01:10.680> of

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
repeaters going into a block dot of

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.760 
repeaters going into a block dot of
redstone<00:01:11.250> dust<00:01:11.640> for<00:01:12.390> repeaters<00:01:12.960> going<00:01:13.439> into

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
redstone dust for repeaters going into

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.679 
redstone dust for repeaters going into
another<00:01:14.220> block<00:01:14.520> and<00:01:14.850> these<00:01:15.090> are<00:01:15.180> gonna<00:01:15.299> be<00:01:15.479> all

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
another block and these are gonna be all

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.770 
another block and these are gonna be all
on<00:01:16.140> four<00:01:16.439> ticks<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:16.890> delay<00:01:17.400> now<00:01:18.000> obviously

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
on four ticks of delay now obviously

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.510 
on four ticks of delay now obviously
feel<00:01:19.020> free<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.320> customize<00:01:19.619> this<00:01:20.189> clock

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
feel free to customize this clock

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.249 
feel free to customize this clock
however<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:21.299> want<00:01:21.540> this<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:21.780> gonna<00:01:21.869> be<00:01:22.080> how

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
however you want this is gonna be how

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.530 
however you want this is gonna be how
often<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:23.340> Machine<00:01:23.700> sort<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.060> triggers<00:01:24.390> so<00:01:24.479> if

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
often the Machine sort of triggers so if

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.120 
often the Machine sort of triggers so if
you<00:01:24.630> want<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.960> trigger<00:01:25.200> every<00:01:25.860> five

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
you want it to trigger every five

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.560 
you want it to trigger every five
minutes<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:26.700> can<00:01:26.850> only<00:01:27.000> enter<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.420> base

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
minutes and you can only enter the base

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.330 
minutes and you can only enter the base
every<00:01:27.930> five<00:01:28.140> minutes<00:01:28.350> will<00:01:28.950> then<00:01:29.159> make<00:01:29.280> a

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
every five minutes will then make a

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.190 
every five minutes will then make a
longer<00:01:29.640> clock<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.509> could<00:01:30.659> do<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:30.840> or

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
longer clock and you could do that or

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.410 
longer clock and you could do that or
you<00:01:31.710> could<00:01:32.070> have<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.369> trigger<00:01:32.579> every<00:01:33.000> second

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
you could have it trigger every second

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.270 
you could have it trigger every second
you<00:01:33.509> know<00:01:33.600> it's<00:01:33.780> all<00:01:33.990> depending<00:01:34.500> on<00:01:34.530> how<00:01:35.070> long

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
you know it's all depending on how long

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.490 
you know it's all depending on how long
you<00:01:35.430> make<00:01:35.579> this<00:01:35.759> clock<00:01:36.030> so<00:01:36.270> go<00:01:36.720> ahead<00:01:36.960> run<00:01:37.290> this

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
you make this clock so go ahead run this

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.830 
you make this clock so go ahead run this
line<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.890> redstone<00:01:38.070> into<00:01:39.030> this<00:01:39.180> piston<00:01:39.600> and

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
line of redstone into this piston and

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.080 
line of redstone into this piston and
place<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.200> repeater<00:01:40.560> right<00:01:41.189> there<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:41.850> now

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
place a repeater right there and now

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.340 
place a repeater right there and now
we're<00:01:42.180> just<00:01:42.299> gonna<00:01:42.420> place<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.750> redstone<00:01:42.930> block

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
we're just gonna place a redstone block

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.469 
we're just gonna place a redstone block
a<00:01:43.560> torch<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.220> that'll<00:01:44.909> get<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.149> machine

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
a torch and that'll get the machine

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.510 
a torch and that'll get the machine
going<00:01:45.750> so<00:01:46.079> it<00:01:46.259> actually<00:01:46.530> glitched<00:01:47.100> out<00:01:47.280> here

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
going so it actually glitched out here

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.460 
going so it actually glitched out here
in<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.700> beginning<00:01:48.060> whoopsies<00:01:48.780> let's<00:01:49.320> go

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
in the beginning whoopsies let's go

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.260 
in the beginning whoopsies let's go
ahead<00:01:49.619> fix<00:01:49.950> this<00:01:50.100> guy<00:01:50.310> so<00:01:50.640> place<00:01:50.909> piston

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
ahead fix this guy so place piston

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.899 
ahead fix this guy so place piston
facing<00:01:51.390> up<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.079> then<00:01:52.500> redstone<00:01:52.979> OOP<00:01:53.430> that's<00:01:53.790> a

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
facing up and then redstone OOP that's a

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.450 
facing up and then redstone OOP that's a
red<00:01:54.060> sand<00:01:54.420> not<00:01:54.630> redstone<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.500> now<00:01:56.130> we're<00:01:56.310> good

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
red sand not redstone and now we're good

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.280 
red sand not redstone and now we're good
to<00:01:56.579> go<00:01:56.610> so<00:01:56.820> if<00:01:57.149> we<00:01:57.270> place<00:01:57.479> our<00:01:57.659> blocks<00:01:57.990> all

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
to go so if we place our blocks all

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.160 
to go so if we place our blocks all
around<00:01:58.829> here<00:01:59.490> like<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.850> so<00:02:00.329> whoopsies

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
around here like a so whoopsies

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.350 
around here like a so whoopsies
there<00:02:01.740> we<00:02:01.950> go<00:02:02.159> we<00:02:02.430> have<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.640> little<00:02:03.030> bit<00:02:03.149> of<00:02:03.270> a

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
there we go we have a little bit of a

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.889 
there we go we have a little bit of a
sand<00:02:04.140> secret<00:02:04.979> base<00:02:05.399> now<00:02:05.820> do<00:02:05.880> make<00:02:06.329> sure<00:02:06.360> before

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
sand secret base now do make sure before

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.020 
sand secret base now do make sure before
you<00:02:07.140> use<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.099> block<00:02:08.340> directly

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
you use it that the block directly

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.570 
you use it that the block directly
underneath<00:02:09.479> this<00:02:09.780> piston<00:02:10.289> is<00:02:10.470> nothing<00:02:11.400> this

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
underneath this piston is nothing this

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.699 
underneath this piston is nothing this
is<00:02:11.640> going<00:02:12.030> to<00:02:12.150> be<00:02:12.300> where<00:02:12.690> you<00:02:12.959> fall<00:02:13.260> through<00:02:13.560> so

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
is going to be where you fall through so

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:13.940 
is going to be where you fall through so
we

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
we

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.640 
we
go<00:02:14.280> down<00:02:14.459> here<00:02:14.940> if<00:02:15.510> I<00:02:15.810> do<00:02:15.870> it<00:02:16.170> right<00:02:16.349> now<00:02:16.530> I'm

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
go down here if I do it right now I'm

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.800 
go down here if I do it right now I'm
gonna<00:02:16.739> go<00:02:16.950> ahead<00:02:17.040> and<00:02:17.220> land<00:02:17.459> on<00:02:17.790> this<00:02:18.330> block<00:02:18.629> so

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
gonna go ahead and land on this block so

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.390 
gonna go ahead and land on this block so
let's<00:02:18.989> test<00:02:19.260> it<00:02:19.440> out<00:02:19.560> we'll<00:02:19.769> go<00:02:19.860> ahead<00:02:20.010> stand

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
let's test it out we'll go ahead stand

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.729 
let's test it out we'll go ahead stand
directly<00:02:20.849> in<00:02:21.209> the<00:02:21.660> middle<00:02:21.900> of<00:02:21.989> the<00:02:22.110> sand<00:02:22.440> we

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
directly in the middle of the sand we

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.199 
directly in the middle of the sand we
get<00:02:22.890> pushed<00:02:23.069> up<00:02:23.280> we<00:02:23.580> fall<00:02:23.790> inside<00:02:24.030> of<00:02:24.150> the

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
get pushed up we fall inside of the

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.140 
get pushed up we fall inside of the
block<00:02:24.420> and<00:02:24.629> there<00:02:25.230> we<00:02:25.410> go<00:02:25.560> we<00:02:25.920> fall<00:02:26.190> down<00:02:26.489> into

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
block and there we go we fall down into

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.910 
block and there we go we fall down into
our<00:02:27.450> little<00:02:27.690> base<00:02:27.930> this<00:02:28.260> is<00:02:28.440> a<00:02:28.470> pretty<00:02:28.709> cool

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
our little base this is a pretty cool

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.860 
our little base this is a pretty cool
entrance<00:02:29.190> for<00:02:29.610> anything<00:02:29.940> it's<00:02:30.150> just<00:02:30.239> fun<00:02:30.660> I

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
entrance for anything it's just fun I

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.050 
entrance for anything it's just fun I
thought<00:02:31.050> it<00:02:31.140> was<00:02:31.230> a<00:02:31.260> silly<00:02:31.530> invention<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.910> way

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
thought it was a silly invention the way

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.880 
thought it was a silly invention the way
it<00:02:33.209> actually<00:02:33.450> works<00:02:33.750> for<00:02:34.170> some<00:02:34.470> reason<00:02:34.769> in

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
it actually works for some reason in

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.070 
it actually works for some reason in
Minecraft<00:02:35.370> when<00:02:35.910> you<00:02:36.030> stand<00:02:36.330> down<00:02:36.569> a<00:02:36.599> block

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
Minecraft when you stand down a block

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.830 
Minecraft when you stand down a block
and<00:02:37.349> a<00:02:37.440> piston<00:02:37.860> pushes<00:02:38.310> you<00:02:38.730> fall<00:02:39.000> inside<00:02:39.660> of

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
and a piston pushes you fall inside of

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.199 
and a piston pushes you fall inside of
the<00:02:39.930> sand<00:02:40.200> block<00:02:40.500> so<00:02:40.769> I<00:02:41.010> sort<00:02:41.610> of<00:02:41.760> took<00:02:41.970> this<00:02:42.150> a

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
the sand block so I sort of took this a

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.479 
the sand block so I sort of took this a
little<00:02:42.450> bit<00:02:42.660> of<00:02:42.780> bug<00:02:43.080> and<00:02:43.470> I<00:02:44.040> went<00:02:44.250> ahead<00:02:44.310> and

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
little bit of bug and I went ahead and

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:46.880 
little bit of bug and I went ahead and
used<00:02:44.790> it<00:02:45.629> to<00:02:45.810> make<00:02:45.930> this<00:02:46.230> a<00:02:46.290> little<00:02:46.500> bit<00:02:46.709> of<00:02:46.799> a

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
used it to make this a little bit of a

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.890 
used it to make this a little bit of a
base<00:02:47.220> entrance<00:02:47.970> I<00:02:48.150> don't<00:02:48.390> know<00:02:48.480> thought<00:02:48.810> it

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
base entrance I don't know thought it

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.199 
base entrance I don't know thought it
was<00:02:48.989> a<00:02:49.019> silly<00:02:49.260> invention<00:02:49.799> and<00:02:49.980> maybe<00:02:50.760> somebody

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
was a silly invention and maybe somebody

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.000 
was a silly invention and maybe somebody
out<00:02:51.360> there<00:02:51.690> would<00:02:51.840> enjoy<00:02:52.079> it<00:02:52.140> so<00:02:52.319> oopsies<00:02:52.829> I'm
