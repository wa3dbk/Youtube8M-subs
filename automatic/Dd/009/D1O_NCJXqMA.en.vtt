00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:14.650
 first I want to say the following if I 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:17.710
 I did not like this one very first. 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.990
 because it did not fit my single 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.330
 like I said before the mother is very wide 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.030
 and another thing I do not know if I can not 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:29.410
 if you can see there but I think it's a 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:33.430
 thing is a defect of the nail 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:36.040
 general not of that mark is specifically 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:39.160
 Every time I put it on, it's my posture. 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:42.719
 break gets extremely massive hence 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:45.719
 without a single one that fits perfectly 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:50.620
 perfectly my fingernail then I liked it 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:54.819
 so to withdraw you do not pull the one 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.920
 because she is you can end can 

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:59.940
 end up getting hurt so why 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:04.629
 Do you have to use any of them? 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:07.810
 substance that softens that glue 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.790
 which is between the nail is only a 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.170
 so like I said to you I do not 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.140
 I really liked the action of the first one because 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:19.259
 she is very small second because in 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:23.680
 packaging says it got the packaging 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:27.159
 packaging says it lasts up to one week is 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:30.310
 how to say it lasts up to a week before 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:33.219
 here only a few nails like the three 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:37.509
 only fell in the second and third 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:38.530
 day and I used the normal glue nÃ© na na na 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:40.750
 posture 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:45.039
 mine is from here only then I do another 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:47.649
 video talking only about thing I do not know 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:50.320
 A lot of a sportswoman, but I know the 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:51.490
 that what I have already used, what I have is 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.219
 as experience 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.799
 You can not hold it, but anyway. 

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:59.679
 still had others who fell 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:02.469
 already yesterday made a week then neither euro 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:05.920
 worry about this piece with this 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:07.840
 union or because as I said it is product 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:13.390
 chemist then it is best to follow the 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:17.660
 packing instructions cadu some 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:21.320
 different types of enamel remover 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.690
 Neither in the package says you have you. 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.610
 can use love and the enamel 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.940
 It's better that you use what 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:31.430
 contains acetone is the one I have 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.960
 example that has no hit is better 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.500
 What do you use that has to be? 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.960
 flamenguista like giving vaccine 69 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:43.490
 years will get a glass otherwise it would be 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:45.350
 a lot of product and then I put it inside it is 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.790
 an option you have you can put 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.820
 you can use this product put of 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.960
 Back in the video I do not like coca. 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.420
 Sorry, I can not I do not like 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.760
 ask a question because the nail 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.710
 people have bacteria these things if you 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.060
 put back will be putting 

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:05.540
 bacteria in the video 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:07.310
 And then you make me feel a bit like 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:12.530
 I was just soaking it 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:15.190
 In this ketone, wait a minute to get a 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.190
 or two minutes 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:24.310
 This time you come with the spatula, right? 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:30.260
 I was already pcp, you'll realize that it's already 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:36.740
 But I live and then you put the spatula between 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:40.459
 the fingernail is this normal fingernail and leaves 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:43.010
 it comes out does not hurt or anything if you do not 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:46.459
 know the process of acetone there is 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:50.120
 sure I already know because I already did 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:54.080
 I went to do this and I ended up 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:56.570
 hurting the one and then you put it right 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:10.150
 Duck entered Portuguese is his only 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:10.150
 and then when you wait for music there 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:23.470
 And one more thing for you, this one. 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.590
 heavy nail not liking the 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:30.400
 technician to say one thing she is not so 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:33.970
 Bad because that's because I wash dishes 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:36.730
 I take a shower in a house. 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.740
 so I'm down I have a whole time 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:42.670
 using your hands doing something with 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:46.270
 hands ne and do not fall all fell 

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:48.000
 some even put it together even when I 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:52.120
 use with glue 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:54.690
 sometimes lasts up to ten days is not 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:59.550
 it is advisable to stay all this time 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:05:07.020
 because if they say I already read right now 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:09.250
 on the internet that is up to seven days is 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:13.390
 advisable but I think this is not 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:22.630
 because you did not even breathe type 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:24.460
 There are people who guard the union. 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:27.790
 use again, right? 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:32.169
 the other option you have 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:35.580
 I do not like to use again but these 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:35.580
 here that did not fit the same 

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:51.080
 then you come with cotton to a 

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:52.969
 same law but returns produce for 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:06:03.399
 take it out 

00:05:52.969 --> 00:06:13.219
 a lamp she remembers herself 

00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:20.509
 which she states that by joining the same 

00:06:13.219 --> 00:06:23.300
 thing that is closed on top of the 

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:26.080
 my mother just to take out software is 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:26.080
 consul consulate 

00:06:29.709 --> 00:06:49.550
 do not let me tell you that it's just 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:58.189
 to the series also do not like and then 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:07:05.689
 then I have one here that is here the 

00:06:58.189 --> 00:07:08.539
 seal silence you start to not take 

00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:13.610
 cuticle and I'm sure I'll spend a day 

00:07:08.539 --> 00:07:22.579
 without doing the nail because my part this 

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:28.279
 It's a craft in beauty, that's it. 

00:07:22.579 --> 00:07:30.759
 If I were to be at one point 

00:07:28.279 --> 00:07:30.759
 I mean
