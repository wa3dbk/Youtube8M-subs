I used my 2-way glue and I glued the

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.820 
I used my 2-way glue and I glued the
whole<00:05:04.630> image<00:05:05.020> in<00:05:05.620> white<00:05:05.950> and<00:05:06.310> I<00:05:07.060> have<00:05:07.540> a<00:05:07.930> 20<00:05:08.800> or

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
2-way glue and i am going to just use it

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:46.250 
2-way glue and i am going to just use it
quickly<00:05:40.450> and<00:05:42.000> I'm<00:05:43.000> going<00:05:43.330> to<00:05:43.479> glue<00:05:43.690> this<00:05:44.050> image

00:07:35.539 --> 00:07:39.040 
cannot get any simpler than what I've
done<00:07:36.050> and<00:07:36.740> put<00:07:37.039> the<00:07:37.219> little<00:07:37.840> probably<00:07:38.840> gonna

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:39.050 
done and put the little probably gonna

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:40.480 
done and put the little probably gonna
have<00:07:39.139> to<00:07:39.199> glue<00:07:39.409> the<00:07:39.590> little<00:07:39.770> pearl<00:07:39.979> back<00:07:40.250> down

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:40.490 
have to glue the little pearl back down

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:44.770 
have to glue the little pearl back down
because<00:07:42.190> the<00:07:43.190> glitter<00:07:43.520> is<00:07:43.909> kind<00:07:44.419> of<00:07:44.509> hard<00:07:44.659> to

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:44.780 
because the glitter is kind of hard to

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:48.899 
because the glitter is kind of hard to
glue<00:07:45.110> on<00:07:45.409> top<00:07:45.770> of<00:07:46.070> once<00:07:46.639> you<00:07:46.940> put<00:07:47.180> it<00:07:47.210> on<00:07:47.680> but

00:07:48.899 --> 00:07:48.909 
glue on top of once you put it on but
