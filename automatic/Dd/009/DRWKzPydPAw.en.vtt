00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.770 
like keeping my main keyboard up on top

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.830 
like keeping my main keyboard up on top
just<00:03:48.370> as<00:03:48.520> for<00:03:48.730> gaming<00:03:49.150> lights<00:03:49.300> a<00:03:49.480> lot<00:03:49.660> more

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
just as for gaming lights a lot more

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.300 
just as for gaming lights a lot more
comfortable<00:03:50.170> to<00:03:50.440> have<00:03:50.590> the<00:03:50.770> keyboard<00:03:50.980> the

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
comfortable to have the keyboard the

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.180 
comfortable to have the keyboard the
mouse<00:03:51.340> on<00:03:51.820> the<00:03:52.090> same<00:03:52.330> level<00:03:52.630> a<00:03:53.040> tempered<00:03:54.040> glass

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
mouse on the same level a tempered glass

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.000 
mouse on the same level a tempered glass
so<00:03:55.180> if<00:03:55.270> you<00:03:55.390> were<00:03:55.540> to<00:03:55.840> pound<00:03:56.350> on<00:03:56.620> it<00:03:56.650> and

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
so if you were to pound on it and

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.610 
so if you were to pound on it and
shatter<00:03:57.459> it<00:03:57.640> for<00:03:58.000> whatever<00:03:58.209> reason<00:03:58.780> it's

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
shatter it for whatever reason it's

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.680 
shatter it for whatever reason it's
meant<00:04:00.130> to<00:04:00.220> spiderwebs<00:04:00.940> it<00:04:01.240> won't<00:04:01.390> be<00:04:01.510> just

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
meant to spiderwebs it won't be just

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.330 
meant to spiderwebs it won't be just
kind<00:04:01.810> of<00:04:01.900> charge<00:04:02.290> of<00:04:02.530> glass<00:04:02.770> everywhere

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
kind of charge of glass everywhere

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.000 
kind of charge of glass everywhere
because<00:04:04.270> it<00:04:04.450> is<00:04:04.630> a<00:04:04.690> glass<00:04:05.110> surface<00:04:05.620> does

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
because it is a glass surface does

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.199 
because it is a glass surface does
typically<00:04:06.489> you're<00:04:06.700> going<00:04:06.820> to<00:04:06.880> get<00:04:07.060> them

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
typically you're going to get them

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:08.940 
typically you're going to get them
pretty<00:04:07.450> dirty<00:04:07.780> especially<00:04:08.410> if<00:04:08.739> you<00:04:08.830> get<00:04:08.890> the

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
pretty dirty especially if you get the

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.740 
pretty dirty especially if you get the
black<00:04:09.250> one<00:04:09.489> like<00:04:09.670> I<00:04:09.790> have<00:04:10.030> it<00:04:10.270> does<00:04:10.420> tend<00:04:10.630> to

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
black one like I have it does tend to

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.780 
black one like I have it does tend to
show<00:04:10.959> things<00:04:11.290> really<00:04:11.800> easily

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
show things really easily

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.460 
show things really easily
so<00:04:13.090> one<00:04:13.300> thing<00:04:13.480> I<00:04:13.570> were<00:04:13.690> going<00:04:13.840> for<00:04:14.020> cleaning

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
so one thing I were going for cleaning

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.400 
so one thing I were going for cleaning
these<00:04:15.160> plugs<00:04:15.550> multi-service<00:04:16.359> everyday<00:04:16.780> wipes

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
these plugs multi-service everyday wipes

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.539 
these plugs multi-service everyday wipes
these<00:04:18.250> are<00:04:18.370> fantastic

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
these are fantastic

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.990 
these are fantastic
just<00:04:19.970> simply<00:04:20.479> wipe<00:04:21.169> everything<00:04:21.500> down

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
just simply wipe everything down

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.490 
just simply wipe everything down
resealable<00:04:23.000> there<00:04:23.659> the<00:04:23.810> master<00:04:24.199> cleaning

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
resealable there the master cleaning

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.779 
resealable there the master cleaning
that<00:04:24.620> asked<00:04:24.889> makes<00:04:25.039> life<00:04:25.310> a<00:04:25.490> little<00:04:25.639> bit

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:25.789 
that asked makes life a little bit

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:27.999 
that asked makes life a little bit
easier<00:04:25.970> in<00:04:26.659> terms<00:04:26.930> of<00:04:27.080> constructing<00:04:27.680> the<00:04:27.800> desk

00:04:27.999 --> 00:04:28.009 
easier in terms of constructing the desk

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:30.550 
easier in terms of constructing the desk
is<00:04:28.340> a<00:04:28.370> little<00:04:28.819> difficult<00:04:29.509> but<00:04:29.690> really<00:04:30.050> not<00:04:30.199> too

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
is a little difficult but really not too

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.890 
is a little difficult but really not too
bad<00:04:30.800> it<00:04:31.310> took<00:04:31.370> me<00:04:31.729> about<00:04:31.849> 45<00:04:32.150> minutes<00:04:32.629> to<00:04:32.750> do

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
bad it took me about 45 minutes to do

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.809 
bad it took me about 45 minutes to do
the<00:04:33.470> instructions<00:04:33.919> are<00:04:34.069> really<00:04:34.190> well<00:04:34.460> written

00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:34.819 
the instructions are really well written

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:36.939 
the instructions are really well written
they're<00:04:35.180> really<00:04:35.449> well<00:04:35.629> you<00:04:36.259> can<00:04:36.409> understand

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:36.949 
they're really well you can understand

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:39.010 
they're really well you can understand
them<00:04:37.099> pretty<00:04:37.370> easily<00:04:37.400> so<00:04:38.300> there's<00:04:38.750> really<00:04:38.840> no

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
them pretty easily so there's really no

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.110 
them pretty easily so there's really no
problems<00:04:39.440> the<00:04:39.530> construction<00:04:40.039> itself<00:04:40.159> you<00:04:40.849> do

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
problems the construction itself you do

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.869 
problems the construction itself you do
need<00:04:41.360> I<00:04:41.389> believe<00:04:41.780> a<00:04:41.810> screwdriver<00:04:42.669> it<00:04:43.669> does

00:04:45.399 --> 00:04:45.409 
come with the allen wrench but you need

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:47.890 
come with the allen wrench but you need
a<00:04:45.590> screwdriver<00:04:45.889> for<00:04:46.520> certain<00:04:46.970> things<00:04:47.180> but<00:04:47.750> I'm

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:47.900 
a screwdriver for certain things but I'm

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.570 
a screwdriver for certain things but I'm
at<00:04:48.110> the<00:04:48.470> construction<00:04:48.770> whether<00:04:49.099> it<00:04:49.430> was

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
at the construction whether it was

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.520 
at the construction whether it was
pretty<00:04:49.849> simple<00:04:50.180> to<00:04:50.270> do<00:04:50.389> it<00:04:50.930> wouldn't<00:04:51.259> hurt<00:04:51.470> to

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
pretty simple to do it wouldn't hurt to

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:53.920 
pretty simple to do it wouldn't hurt to
have<00:04:51.710> a<00:04:51.830> second<00:04:52.190> person<00:04:52.219> to<00:04:52.669> hold<00:04:52.879> things<00:04:53.270> but

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
have a second person to hold things but

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.600 
have a second person to hold things but
if<00:04:54.080> you<00:04:54.289> have<00:04:54.409> something<00:04:54.680> like<00:04:54.919> a<00:04:54.949> bed<00:04:55.310> you<00:04:55.490> can

if you have something like a bed you can

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.670 
if you have something like a bed you can
