device<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:21.539> impossible<00:00:22.289> is<00:00:23.840> let's<00:00:24.840> look<00:00:25.080> at<00:00:25.230> a

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
device the impossible is let's look at a

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:42.430 
device the impossible is let's look at a
real<00:00:25.529> world<00:00:25.769> example

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.800 

certain<00:00:43.440> objects<00:00:43.980> may<00:00:44.190> be<00:00:44.220> vital<00:00:44.790> to<00:00:44.820> yours

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:45.810 
certain objects may be vital to yours

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.440 
certain objects may be vital to yours
if<00:00:46.050> at<00:00:46.230> first<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.680> don't<00:00:46.800> succeed<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.820> fail

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
if at first you don't succeed you fail

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.890 
if at first you don't succeed you fail
and<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.350> test<00:00:49.590> will<00:00:49.860> be<00:00:50.010> terminated<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:51.600> fail

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:51.900 
and the test will be terminated you fail

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.250 
and the test will be terminated you fail
and<00:00:52.560> remember<00:00:53.220> our<00:00:53.250> motto<00:00:53.570> there's<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.660> hole<00:00:54.990> in

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
and remember our motto there's a hole in

and remember our motto there's a hole in
the<00:00:55.440> through<00:00:56.160> which<00:00:56.400> things<00:00:56.790> can<00:00:57.210> fall<00:01:03.890> at<00:01:04.890> the

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:05.190 
the through which things can fall at the

the through which things can fall at the
enrichment<00:01:05.580> center<00:01:05.910> we<00:01:06.720> believe<00:01:07.110> that<00:01:07.320> a

highly motivated mother hope and carry
out<00:01:09.750> rather<00:01:10.080> complex<00:01:10.740> practical<00:01:11.280> problems

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
out rather complex practical problems

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.630 
out rather complex practical problems
during<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.540> most<00:01:12.750> intense<00:01:12.990> so<00:01:13.979> in<00:01:14.130> case<00:01:14.370> you

this<00:01:39.470> next<00:01:39.890> test<00:01:40.100> is<00:01:40.430> easy

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.340
