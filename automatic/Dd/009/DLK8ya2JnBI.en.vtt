00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 today we will talk about the substratum of 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.840
 aquarium 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.840
 come on 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.439
 but what is the substrate is nothing more than 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.180
 that the land at the bottom of the 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.850
 our room 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.370
 and it is precisely she who gives the support and 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.000
 all the nutrients necessary for the 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.800
 plant survival 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.079
 therefore the substrate is one of the factors 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.480
 essential for an aquarium 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.170
 planted very beautiful like the one that 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.170
 we are seeing 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:59.699
 of course we can find two 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.510
 types of substrate the fertile substrate and 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.489
 the inert substrate 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.740
 in the image we can see the two types of 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.860
 substrate side by side with the most 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.770
 clear is sand is the inert substrate and 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:19.200
 the darkest is the fertile substrate a 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:21.180
 specific substrate boards in 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.299
 example of inert substrate I 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.210
 I'm using white sand even she 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.850
 is more used as decoration or for 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.880
 cover some types of fertile substrate 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.970
 who can not come into direct contact 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.580
 with water failure 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.870
 the inert substrate has no type 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.520
 of nutrient 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.410
 hence the plants can not 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.750
 food so it is very important 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:48.610
 together with inert substrate the use 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.610
 of a fertile substrate 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:57.650
 already the iron substrate is carefully 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.230
 developed to guarantee all 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.400
 nutrients from which a plant 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.040
 you need 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:07.520
 so it is ideal in aquariums where 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:11.770
 we will plant without them plants do not 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:14.330
 they have been alive and beautiful for a long time 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.980
 Thank you for watching our video. 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.090
