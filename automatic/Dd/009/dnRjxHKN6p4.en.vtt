this<00:00:30.210> on<00:00:30.449> my<00:00:30.720> last<00:00:30.929> video<00:00:31.140> when<00:00:31.830> I<00:00:31.859> showed

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.540 
this on my last video when I showed

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.970 
this on my last video when I showed
booting<00:00:33.540> up<00:00:33.690> on<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:33.960> USB<00:00:34.350> flash<00:00:34.380> drive<00:00:34.829> with

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
booting up on a USB flash drive with

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.950 
booting up on a USB flash drive with
Haier<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:35.250> Cebu<00:00:35.460> City<00:00:35.540> so<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:36.570> thought<00:00:36.750> make<00:00:36.930> a

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
Haier and Cebu City so I thought make a

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.540 
Haier and Cebu City so I thought make a
quick<00:00:37.200> video<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.620> show<00:00:37.649> you<00:00:37.829> that<00:00:38.100> it's<00:00:38.219> pretty

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
quick video to show you that it's pretty

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.270 
quick video to show you that it's pretty
easy<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:38.910> do<00:00:39.379> now<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.530> program<00:00:40.800> I'm<00:00:41.129> going<00:00:41.160> to

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
easy to do now the program I'm going to

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.760 
easy to do now the program I'm going to
be<00:00:41.370> using<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:42.210> program<00:00:42.719> called<00:00:42.989> Rufus<00:00:43.410> it's

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
be using is a program called Rufus it's

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.260 
be using is a program called Rufus it's
a<00:00:43.950> free<00:00:44.370> tool<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:44.760> think<00:00:44.789> that's<00:00:45.120> how<00:00:45.239> you

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
a free tool I think that's how you

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.240 
a free tool I think that's how you
pronounce<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.379> what<00:00:46.590> this<00:00:46.680> does<00:00:46.890> is<00:00:47.100> it

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
pronounce it and what this does is it

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.580 
pronounce it and what this does is it
allows<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.670> create<00:00:48.030> bootable<00:00:48.930> flash

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
allows you to create bootable flash

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.610 
allows you to create bootable flash
drives<00:00:50.190> is<00:00:50.550> pretty<00:00:50.850> easy<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.210> do<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:51.719> you<00:00:52.440> can

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
drives is pretty easy to do and you can

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.080 
drives is pretty easy to do and you can
do<00:00:52.739> some<00:00:52.980> other<00:00:53.100> stuff<00:00:53.190> with<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.699> now<00:00:53.850> it's<00:00:53.940> not

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
do some other stuff with it now it's not

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.600 
do some other stuff with it now it's not
just<00:00:54.329> for<00:00:54.480> horns<00:00:54.899> boo<00:00:55.050> City<00:00:55.320> it's<00:00:55.559> for<00:00:55.770> windows

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
just for horns boo City it's for windows

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.549 
just for horns boo City it's for windows
disks<00:00:57.059> ISO<00:00:57.510> images<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.140> all<00:00:58.230> these<00:00:58.410> other

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
disks ISO images and all these other

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.439 
disks ISO images and all these other
types<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:59.070> things<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.730> you<00:00:59.910> can<00:01:00.059> do<00:01:00.210> with<00:01:00.329> it

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
types of things that you can do with it

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.959 
types of things that you can do with it
okay<00:01:00.690> so<00:01:00.750> it's<00:01:00.960> not<00:01:01.109> just<00:01:01.320> for<00:01:01.410> one<00:01:01.620> thing<00:01:01.980> but

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
okay so it's not just for one thing but

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.509 
okay so it's not just for one thing but
it<00:01:03.149> also<00:01:03.329> claims<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.500> be<00:01:04.619> one<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:04.979> fastest

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
it also claims to be one of the fastest

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.969 
it also claims to be one of the fastest
now<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:05.850> have<00:01:06.030> not<00:01:06.210> tested<00:01:06.390> this<00:01:06.720> myself<00:01:07.170> but<00:01:07.860> it

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
now I have not tested this myself but it

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.740 
now I have not tested this myself but it
stacks<00:01:08.400> up<00:01:08.549> against<00:01:08.880> some<00:01:09.119> of<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.270> others<00:01:09.540> as

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
stacks up against some of the others as

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.620 
stacks up against some of the others as
being<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:10.200> fastest<00:01:10.740> at<00:01:11.280> doing<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.909> Windows

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
being the fastest at doing a Windows

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.530 
being the fastest at doing a Windows
installation<00:01:12.990> onto<00:01:13.590> an<00:01:14.100> actual<00:01:14.939> USB<00:01:15.299> flash

CD<00:03:55.610> click<00:03:56.610> OK<00:03:57.000> here

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.330 

and<00:04:02.210> now<00:04:02.990> let's<00:04:03.200> start<00:04:03.470> transferring<00:04:04.220> that

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
and now let's start transferring that

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.120 
and now let's start transferring that
iso<00:04:04.730> image<00:04:05.000> across<00:04:05.450> to<00:04:05.840> the<00:04:06.620> actual<00:04:06.920> thumb

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
iso image across to the actual thumb

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:08.560 
iso image across to the actual thumb
drive<00:04:07.340> then<00:04:07.550> this<00:04:07.700> may<00:04:07.880> take<00:04:08.090> a<00:04:08.150> little<00:04:08.420> bit<00:04:08.510> of

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
drive then this may take a little bit of

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:18.860 
drive then this may take a little bit of
time

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.080 

okay<00:04:19.590> so<00:04:19.650> that<00:04:19.889> now<00:04:20.070> is<00:04:20.130> completely<00:04:20.639> turn<00:04:20.970> as

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
okay so that now is completely turn as

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:22.720 
okay so that now is completely turn as
you<00:04:21.209> can<00:04:21.299> see<00:04:21.389> that<00:04:21.540> took<00:04:21.690> about<00:04:21.870> 19<00:04:22.260> minutes

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:22.730 
you can see that took about 19 minutes

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:25.850 
you can see that took about 19 minutes
to<00:04:23.730> do<00:04:23.910> so<00:04:24.240> it<00:04:24.360> takes<00:04:24.570> a<00:04:24.690> quite<00:04:24.900> a<00:04:24.930> while<00:04:25.169> to

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
to do so it takes a quite a while to

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.490 
to do so it takes a quite a while to
actually<00:04:25.919> copy<00:04:26.580> those<00:04:26.820> across<00:04:27.290> so<00:04:28.290> we<00:04:28.380> can

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
actually copy those across so we can

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.439 
actually copy those across so we can
finish<00:04:28.650> this<00:04:28.919> off<00:04:29.100> now<00:04:29.280> by<00:04:29.430> closing<00:04:29.699> this<00:04:30.000> if

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:30.449 
finish this off now by closing this if

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:32.090 
finish this off now by closing this if
we<00:04:30.600> have<00:04:30.720> a<00:04:30.750> look<00:04:30.870> at<00:04:31.020> our<00:04:31.139> pen<00:04:31.440> drive<00:04:31.680> itself

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100
