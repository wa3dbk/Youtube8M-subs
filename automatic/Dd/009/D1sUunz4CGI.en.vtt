00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
man okay I was not good not good and

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.349 
man okay I was not good not good and
will<00:03:45.409> so<00:03:45.620> get<00:03:45.799> a<00:03:45.859> good<00:03:46.219> majority<00:03:46.609> of<00:03:46.849> the<00:03:47.120> gold

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:47.359 
will so get a good majority of the gold

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:53.020 
will so get a good majority of the gold
though<00:03:47.889> so<00:03:48.889> it's<00:03:49.129> not<00:03:49.310> a<00:03:49.370> total<00:03:49.519> loss<00:03:49.909> I<00:03:52.030> think

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
though so it's not a total loss I think

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:57.369 
though so it's not a total loss I think
I<00:03:53.090> was<00:03:53.180> going<00:03:53.359> to<00:03:53.569> surrender<00:03:54.139> now<00:03:56.049> okay<00:03:57.049> that

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:57.379 
I was going to surrender now okay that

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:02.490 
I was going to surrender now okay that
was<00:03:58.000> decent<00:03:59.000> gold<00:03:59.209> but<00:03:59.889> those<00:04:00.889> bombs<00:04:01.340> Manos

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
was decent gold but those bombs Manos

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.640 
was decent gold but those bombs Manos
children<00:04:03.500> slaughtered<00:04:05.049> now<00:04:06.049> can<00:04:06.319> I<00:04:06.409> hear

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
children slaughtered now can I hear

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.119 
children slaughtered now can I hear
another<00:04:06.829> Archer<00:04:07.819> tower<00:04:08.199> and<00:04:09.199> I<00:04:09.799> think<00:04:10.010> we'll

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:10.129 
another Archer tower and I think we'll

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:12.440 
another Archer tower and I think we'll
finish<00:04:10.340> up<00:04:10.549> the<00:04:10.819> rest<00:04:10.939> a's<00:04:11.150> walls

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
finish up the rest a's walls

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.929 
finish up the rest a's walls
the<00:04:13.050> mouth

00:04:17.929 --> 00:04:17.939 

00:04:17.939 --> 00:04:23.330 

here<00:04:18.939> we<00:04:19.180> go<00:04:21.030> see<00:04:22.030> what<00:04:22.360> else<00:04:22.569> we<00:04:22.750> can<00:04:22.780> upgrade

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
here we go see what else we can upgrade

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.420 
here we go see what else we can upgrade
we<00:04:24.340> could<00:04:24.490> do<00:04:24.580> a<00:04:25.110> cannon<00:04:26.110> if<00:04:26.560> we<00:04:26.770> read<00:04:27.129> some

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
we could do a cannon if we read some

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.969 
we could do a cannon if we read some
more<00:04:27.610> or<00:04:28.180> something<00:04:28.810> else<00:04:29.110> but<00:04:29.199> I<00:04:29.439> think<00:04:29.740> imma

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:29.979 
more or something else but I think imma

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:32.459 
more or something else but I think imma
keep<00:04:30.129> the<00:04:30.310> Builder<00:04:30.719> available<00:04:31.719> at<00:04:32.050> the<00:04:32.199> walls

00:04:32.459 --> 00:04:32.469 
keep the Builder available at the walls

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:34.980 
keep the Builder available at the walls
while<00:04:32.770> these<00:04:33.150> buildings<00:04:34.150> upgrade<00:04:34.539> and<00:04:34.780> then<00:04:34.960> I

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
while these buildings upgrade and then I

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.649 
while these buildings upgrade and then I
can<00:04:35.199> get<00:04:35.379> a<00:04:35.620> few<00:04:36.129> level<00:04:36.550> for<00:04:36.879> wall<00:04:37.090> sandwich<00:04:37.599> I

00:04:39.649 --> 00:04:39.659 
can get a few level for wall sandwich I

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:42.499 
can get a few level for wall sandwich I
think<00:04:40.659> that<00:04:40.810> will<00:04:40.930> conclude<00:04:41.110> this<00:04:41.349> episode

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:42.509 
think that will conclude this episode

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:44.700 
think that will conclude this episode
