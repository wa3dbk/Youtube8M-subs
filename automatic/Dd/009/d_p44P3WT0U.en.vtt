Reach<00:00:03.149> is<00:00:03.179> a<00:00:03.449> fictional<00:00:04.080> planet<00:00:04.529> in<00:00:04.650> the<00:00:04.710> Halo

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
Reach is a fictional planet in the Halo

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.769 
Reach is a fictional planet in the Halo
universe<00:00:04.980> where<00:00:05.700> the<00:00:05.790> Spartans<00:00:06.210> were<00:00:06.330> created

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
universe where the Spartans were created

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.290 
universe where the Spartans were created
when<00:00:07.500> the<00:00:07.589> Covenant<00:00:07.919> found<00:00:08.250> it<00:00:08.519> they<00:00:08.940> glassed

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
when the Covenant found it they glassed

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.910 
when the Covenant found it they glassed
it<00:00:09.599> so<00:00:09.990> what<00:00:10.200> would<00:00:10.290> it<00:00:10.410> take<00:00:10.559> to<00:00:10.620> actually

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
it so what would it take to actually

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.450 
it so what would it take to actually
glass<00:00:11.550> a<00:00:11.580> planet<00:00:12.090> and<00:00:12.269> is<00:00:12.389> it<00:00:12.509> even<00:00:12.630> possible

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:13.460 
glass a planet and is it even possible

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.070 
glass a planet and is it even possible
the<00:00:14.460> geography<00:00:14.969> of<00:00:15.000> reach<00:00:15.330> is<00:00:15.570> somewhat

the geography of reach is somewhat

the geography of reach is somewhat

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
years this seems like a long time but

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.249 
years this seems like a long time but
considering<00:01:18.240> reach<00:01:18.450> has<00:01:18.630> been<00:01:18.780> around<00:01:18.960> for

blink of the cosmic eye plasma is
generally<00:01:25.350> measured<00:01:25.560> in<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.130> amount<00:01:26.310> of

energy per unit volume but for
comparison<00:01:29.579> purposes<00:01:29.939> let's<00:01:30.240> take<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.450> look<00:01:30.659> at

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
comparison purposes let's take a look at

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.380 
comparison purposes let's take a look at
temperature<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:32.189> average<00:01:32.220> melting<00:01:33.030> point<00:01:33.240> of

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
temperature the average melting point of

temperature the average melting point of
most<00:01:33.600> silicates<00:01:34.170> is<00:01:34.409> about<00:01:34.920> 1,200<00:01:35.790> degrees

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
most silicates is about 1,200 degrees

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.240 
most silicates is about 1,200 degrees
Celsius<00:01:36.659> therefore<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.799> need<00:01:37.920> to<00:01:38.040> make<00:01:38.220> sure

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
Celsius therefore you need to make sure

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.609 
Celsius therefore you need to make sure
that<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.700> plasma<00:01:39.000> has<00:01:39.450> enough<00:01:39.720> exposure<00:01:40.259> time

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
that the plasma has enough exposure time

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.580 
that the plasma has enough exposure time

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
would you hide if earth was being
