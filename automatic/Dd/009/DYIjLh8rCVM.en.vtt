00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:17.430 
muff pie with tone wicker let's take a
look<00:00:15.520> at<00:00:15.610> the<00:00:15.670> pedal<00:00:15.940> we've<00:00:16.720> got<00:00:16.960> a<00:00:16.990> volume

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:17.440 
look at the pedal we've got a volume

what they do the sustain control is

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.910 
what they do the sustain control is
basically<00:00:22.240> your<00:00:22.630> drive<00:00:22.930> gain<00:00:23.260> Distortion

the amount of overdrive and then here
we've<00:00:28.870> got<00:00:29.050> a<00:00:29.290> tone<00:00:29.650> switch<00:00:29.890> and<00:00:30.280> a<00:00:30.400> wicker

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
to notice a very large jump in volume

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.099 
to notice a very large jump in volume
the<00:00:53.800> Wicker<00:00:54.039> knob<00:00:54.370> usually<00:00:55.149> set<00:00:55.420> off<00:00:55.629> here

00:00:56.099 --> 00:00:56.109 
the Wicker knob usually set off here

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:58.020 
the Wicker knob usually set off here
when<00:00:56.379> we<00:00:56.469> turn<00:00:56.679> it<00:00:56.829> on<00:00:57.010> it<00:00:57.309> acts<00:00:57.489> as<00:00:57.699> a<00:00:57.729> top

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
when we turn it on it acts as a top

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.369 
when we turn it on it acts as a top
boost<00:00:58.390> it's<00:00:58.659> really<00:00:58.870> going<00:00:59.019> to<00:00:59.079> accentuate

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
boost it's really going to accentuate

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:02.189 
boost it's really going to accentuate
some<00:01:00.190> higher<00:01:00.399> frequencies<00:01:01.030> so<00:01:01.659> let's<00:01:01.899> take<00:01:02.170> a

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 
some higher frequencies so let's take a

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:03.840 
some higher frequencies so let's take a
listen<00:01:02.499> to<00:01:02.649> what<00:01:02.949> this<00:01:03.069> thing<00:01:03.280> sounds<00:01:03.519> like

and I'm going to turn off the tone we're

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:05.620 
and I'm going to turn off the tone we're
bypassing<00:02:04.250> the<00:02:04.789> tone<00:02:05.000> switch<00:02:05.179> we're<00:02:05.450> going<00:02:05.569> to

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
bypassing the tone switch we're going to

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.300 
bypassing the tone switch we're going to
hear<00:02:05.840> a<00:02:05.869> louder<00:02:06.229> volume<00:02:06.710> let's<00:02:06.920> hear<00:02:07.130> what<00:02:07.280> it

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
hear a louder volume let's hear what it

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:16.660 
hear a louder volume let's hear what it
does<00:02:07.520> to<00:02:07.700> the<00:02:07.850> distortion<00:02:15.459> still<00:02:16.459> got<00:02:16.580> the

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
does to the distortion still got the

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.880 
does to the distortion still got the
same<00:02:16.849> kind<00:02:17.090> of<00:02:17.120> retro<00:02:17.480> saturation<00:02:18.410> happening

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
same kind of retro saturation happening

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.190 
same kind of retro saturation happening
at<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.190> lower<00:02:19.370> sustain<00:02:19.940> but<00:02:20.569> with<00:02:20.810> the<00:02:20.930> lack

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
at the lower sustain but with the lack

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.619 
at the lower sustain but with the lack
of<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:21.560> tone<00:02:22.010> knob<00:02:22.340> it<00:02:22.849> seems<00:02:23.239> to<00:02:23.390> be<00:02:23.480> more

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:23.629 
of the tone knob it seems to be more

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:26.710 
of the tone knob it seems to be more
transparent<00:02:24.549> let's<00:02:25.549> do<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:25.880> same<00:02:26.090> thing<00:02:26.450> with

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
transparent let's do the same thing with

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:35.760 
transparent let's do the same thing with
the<00:02:27.110> sustain<00:02:28.010> cranked

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.370 

very<00:02:36.640> cool<00:02:36.910> it's<00:02:37.060> a<00:02:37.120> very<00:02:37.450> very<00:02:37.750> cool<00:02:37.990> kind<00:02:38.290> of

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
very cool it's a very very cool kind of

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.260 
very cool it's a very very cool kind of
break<00:02:38.620> up<00:02:38.830> again<00:02:39.430> I'm<00:02:39.700> playing<00:02:39.970> the<00:02:40.060> same

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
break up again I'm playing the same

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:41.730 
break up again I'm playing the same
thing<00:02:40.420> over<00:02:40.600> and<00:02:40.780> over<00:02:40.930> again<00:02:41.170> so<00:02:41.410> you<00:02:41.440> can

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
thing over and over again so you can

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.710 
thing over and over again so you can
hear<00:02:42.100> how<00:02:42.280> these<00:02:42.550> knobs<00:02:42.820> are<00:02:43.060> changing<00:02:43.570> the

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
hear how these knobs are changing the

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.320 
hear how these knobs are changing the
sound<00:02:43.960> now<00:02:44.830> let's<00:02:45.040> put<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.280> sustain<00:02:45.670> back<00:02:46.000> at

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
sound now let's put the sustain back at

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.230 
sound now let's put the sustain back at
the<00:02:46.810> middle<00:02:47.140> position<00:02:47.290> here<00:02:47.980> and<00:02:48.100> let's<00:02:49.000> hit

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
the middle position here and let's hit

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.060 
the middle position here and let's hit
the<00:02:49.420> Wicker<00:02:49.720> switch<00:02:50.200> again<00:02:50.500> this<00:02:50.620> is<00:02:50.770> a<00:02:50.800> top

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
the Wicker switch again this is a top

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.970 
the Wicker switch again this is a top
boost<00:02:51.340> it's<00:02:51.550> going<00:02:51.670> to<00:02:51.730> accentuate<00:02:52.300> a<00:02:52.960> lot<00:02:53.770> of

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
boost it's going to accentuate a lot of

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:10.830 
boost it's going to accentuate a lot of
the<00:02:54.070> higher<00:02:54.250> frequencies

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.140 

and<00:03:10.959> yeah<00:03:11.890> that's<00:03:12.099> definitely<00:03:12.280> a<00:03:12.640> very<00:03:12.849> cool

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
and yeah that's definitely a very cool

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.479 
and yeah that's definitely a very cool
variation<00:03:13.840> on<00:03:14.050> the<00:03:14.200> original<00:03:14.709> big<00:03:14.950> muff<00:03:15.190> pie
