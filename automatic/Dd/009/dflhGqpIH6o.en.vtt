00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
the two and it's easiest to to say which

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
so without even playing it's going to be

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.350 
so without even playing it's going to be
right<00:01:33.600> left<00:01:34.049> right<00:01:34.560> right<00:01:34.770> left<00:01:35.610> right<00:01:35.909> left
