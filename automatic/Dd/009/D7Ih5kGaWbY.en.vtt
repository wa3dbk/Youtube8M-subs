little<00:03:18.310> step-back<00:03:18.580> create<00:03:19.180> some<00:03:19.330> space<00:03:19.450> and<00:03:19.870> I

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
little step-back create some space and I

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:26.640 
little step-back create some space and I
got<00:03:20.410> a<00:03:20.440> jumper<00:03:20.830> that<00:03:20.920> I<00:03:21.040> can<00:03:21.190> meet

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.770 

to<00:03:27.370> this<00:03:27.519> point<00:03:27.700> in<00:03:27.819> the<00:03:27.879> game<00:03:27.909> every<00:03:28.299> basket<00:03:28.689> I

to this point in the game every basket I

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.539 
to this point in the game every basket I
score<00:03:29.049> has<00:03:29.170> been<00:03:29.319> some<00:03:29.470> type<00:03:29.650> of<00:03:29.680> attack<00:03:30.159> into

score has been some type of attack into
the<00:03:30.640> paint<00:03:30.909> or<00:03:31.120> to<00:03:31.329> the<00:03:31.360> basket<00:03:31.930> so<00:03:32.110> now<00:03:32.290> when<00:03:32.500> I

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
the paint or to the basket so now when I

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.899 
the paint or to the basket so now when I
just<00:03:32.799> pull<00:03:33.010> straight<00:03:33.040> up<00:03:33.370> he's<00:03:33.700> already

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:33.909 
just pull straight up he's already

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:36.479 
just pull straight up he's already
sagging<00:03:34.390> off<00:03:34.510> expecting<00:03:35.170> that<00:03:35.290> drive<00:03:35.590> all<00:03:35.950> you

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
sagging off expecting that drive all you

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:44.960 
sagging off expecting that drive all you
got<00:03:36.579> to<00:03:36.670> do<00:03:36.790> is<00:03:36.819> hit

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.360 

I<00:03:45.290> think<00:03:46.290> he<00:03:46.380> was<00:03:46.470> kind<00:03:46.650> of<00:03:46.740> expecting<00:03:47.190> me<00:03:47.280> to

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
I think he was kind of expecting me to

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.190 
I think he was kind of expecting me to
go<00:03:47.490> for<00:03:47.670> the<00:03:47.730> pull<00:03:47.940> up<00:03:48.060> here<00:03:48.270> so<00:03:48.480> when<00:03:48.630> I<00:03:48.660> pull

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
go for the pull up here so when I pull

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.320 
go for the pull up here so when I pull
that<00:03:49.410> dribble<00:03:49.740> up<00:03:49.980> to<00:03:50.220> shoot<00:03:50.550> he<00:03:50.790> reaches<00:03:51.180> in

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
that dribble up to shoot he reaches in

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:52.940 
that dribble up to shoot he reaches in
and<00:03:51.510> disrupts<00:03:52.020> my<00:03:52.140> timing<00:03:52.590> but<00:03:52.680> then<00:03:52.830> he

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
and disrupts my timing but then he

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.130 
and disrupts my timing but then he
doesn't<00:03:53.160> play<00:03:53.850> the<00:03:53.970> second<00:03:54.360> move<00:03:54.510> and<00:03:54.900> still

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
doesn't play the second move and still

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.320 
doesn't play the second move and still
open<00:03:55.560> look<00:03:55.740> and<00:03:55.950> I<00:03:56.400> knock<00:03:56.610> it<00:03:56.760> down<00:03:56.910> he<00:03:57.180> was

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
open look and I knock it down he was

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:58.940 
open look and I knock it down he was
there<00:03:57.570> but<00:03:57.600> he<00:03:57.840> didn't<00:03:58.140> play<00:03:58.260> that<00:03:58.350> he<00:03:58.770> didn't

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
there but he didn't play that he didn't

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:08.510 
there but he didn't play that he didn't
finish<00:03:59.070> the<00:03:59.280> play

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.140 

three-pointer<00:04:09.520> off<00:04:09.550> the<00:04:09.760> dribble<00:04:09.970> is

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
three-pointer off the dribble is

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.760 
three-pointer off the dribble is
probably<00:04:10.390> one<00:04:10.750> of<00:04:10.780> the<00:04:10.900> most<00:04:10.990> difficult<00:04:11.140> shots

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
probably one of the most difficult shots

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.680 
probably one of the most difficult shots
in<00:04:11.950> basketball<00:04:12.100> once<00:04:12.730> the<00:04:12.850> score<00:04:13.120> gets<00:04:13.420> into

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
in basketball once the score gets into

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:14.970 
in basketball once the score gets into
