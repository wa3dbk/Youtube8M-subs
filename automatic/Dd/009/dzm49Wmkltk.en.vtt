00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
we wanted the score to reflect that so

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.370 
we wanted the score to reflect that so
it's<00:00:34.770> very<00:00:34.829> aggressive<00:00:35.719> rudl<00:00:36.750> in-your-face

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
it's very aggressive rudl in-your-face

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
and we wanted to convey that feeling

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.979 
and we wanted to convey that feeling
more<00:00:40.829> than<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.100> typical<00:00:41.250> fantasy<00:00:41.700> score<00:00:42.210> so

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
more than the typical fantasy score so

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.170 
more than the typical fantasy score so
while<00:00:43.739> I<00:00:44.010> still<00:00:44.340> used<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.760> large<00:00:44.969> Orchestra

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
sort of make the score unique well we

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.170 
sort of make the score unique well we
had<00:00:51.780> one<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.590> goals<00:00:52.800> was<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.129> really<00:00:53.610> make

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
had one of the goals was to really make

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.639 
had one of the goals was to really make
the<00:00:54.329> percussion<00:00:54.809> section<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.320> he<00:00:55.410> stopped

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
the percussion section and he stopped

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.799 
the percussion section and he stopped
the<00:00:55.739> game<00:00:55.860> really<00:00:56.250> massive<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:57.000> brutal<00:00:57.570> and

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
the game really massive and brutal and

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.720 
the game really massive and brutal and
pretty<00:00:58.649> awful<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.070> bring<00:00:59.250> it<00:00:59.340> up<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.609> next

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
pretty awful to bring it up to the next

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.160 
pretty awful to bring it up to the next
level<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:01.489> kind<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.579> reflect<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.539> game's

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
level and kind of reflect the game's

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.240 
level and kind of reflect the game's
dark<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.240> you<00:01:06.240> know<00:01:06.360> brutal<00:01:06.689> combat<00:01:07.159> kind<00:01:08.159> of

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
dark and you know brutal combat kind of

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.160 
dark and you know brutal combat kind of
mix<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:08.549> in<00:01:08.640> with<00:01:08.670> Chris's<00:01:09.090> stuff<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.600> I

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
mix that in with Chris's stuff and I

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.210 
mix that in with Chris's stuff and I
think<00:01:10.350> we<00:01:10.740> got<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:10.950> really<00:01:11.070> good<00:01:11.250> mixture<00:01:13.220> well

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
think we got a really good mixture well

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.429 
think we got a really good mixture well
for<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.820> score<00:01:15.180> we<00:01:15.659> didn't<00:01:15.990> want<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.170> do<00:01:16.290> the

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
for the score we didn't want to do the

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.429 
for the score we didn't want to do the
typical<00:01:16.619> fantasy<00:01:17.250> go<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.030> fantasy<00:01:18.570> route<00:01:18.750> so

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
typical fantasy go to a fantasy route so

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.039 
typical fantasy go to a fantasy route so
we<00:01:19.920> were<00:01:20.159> thinking<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:21.390> score<00:01:21.689> needs<00:01:21.930> to

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
we were thinking the score needs to

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.260 
we were thinking the score needs to
sound<00:01:22.640> ancient<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:23.880> needs<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.119> sound

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
sound ancient it needs to sound

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.800 
sound ancient it needs to sound
primitive<00:01:24.840> somehow<00:01:25.259> so<00:01:26.479> when<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.540> was<00:01:27.630> writing

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
primitive somehow so when I was writing

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:28.969 
primitive somehow so when I was writing
the<00:01:27.960> orchestra<00:01:28.380> saying<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.710> what's<00:01:28.890> more

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
the orchestra saying it what's more

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.670 
the orchestra saying it what's more
primitive<00:01:29.400> than<00:01:29.880> drums<00:01:30.360> really<00:01:30.689> so<00:01:31.380> I<00:01:31.409> made

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
primitive than drums really so I made

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.860 
primitive than drums really so I made
the<00:01:31.860> orchestra<00:01:32.369> actually

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:32.870 
the orchestra actually

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.220 
the orchestra actually
very<00:01:33.110> percussive<00:01:33.470> it's<00:01:34.250> very<00:01:34.640> rhythmic<00:01:35.230> while

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:36.230 
very percussive it's very rhythmic while

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.140 
very percussive it's very rhythmic while
it<00:01:36.380> has<00:01:36.500> its<00:01:36.710> melodic<00:01:36.980> side<00:01:37.370> to<00:01:37.610> it<00:01:37.760> it's<00:01:37.940> also

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
it has its melodic side to it it's also

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.100 
it has its melodic side to it it's also
I<00:01:38.980> would<00:01:39.980> say<00:01:40.130> not<00:01:40.400> super<00:01:40.940> melodic<00:01:41.780> it's<00:01:41.930> just

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
I would say not super melodic it's just

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.050 
I would say not super melodic it's just
more<00:01:42.320> it's<00:01:42.470> very<00:01:42.710> just<00:01:42.920> aggressive<00:01:43.460> playing

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
more it's very just aggressive playing

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.370 
more it's very just aggressive playing
all<00:01:44.480> the<00:01:44.660> way<00:01:44.750> through<00:01:45.020> and<00:01:46.900> to<00:01:47.900> stay<00:01:48.110> with<00:01:48.290> the

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
all the way through and to stay with the

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.850 
all the way through and to stay with the
whole<00:01:48.500> primitive<00:01:49.040> idea<00:01:49.700> I<00:01:50.260> set<00:01:51.260> the<00:01:51.410> whole

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
whole primitive idea I set the whole

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.220 
whole primitive idea I set the whole

stones and different dense materials and
then<00:02:34.660> I<00:02:34.720> would<00:02:34.870> sample<00:02:35.140> that<00:02:35.410> put<00:02:36.310> it<00:02:36.400> back

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
then I would sample that put it back

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.180 
then I would sample that put it back
into<00:02:36.670> the<00:02:36.790> computer<00:02:37.210> and<00:02:37.770> the<00:02:38.770> chemo

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
into the computer and the chemo

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.190 
into the computer and the chemo
workstation<00:02:39.760> of<00:02:39.880> would<00:02:40.000> then<00:02:40.150> edit<00:02:41.110> and

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
workstation of would then edit and

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.790 
workstation of would then edit and
modify<00:02:41.380> the<00:02:41.770> sounds<00:02:42.600> to<00:02:43.600> give<00:02:43.780> it<00:02:43.930> a<00:02:43.960> sense<00:02:44.680> of

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
modify the sounds to give it a sense of

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.170 
modify the sounds to give it a sense of
weight<00:02:45.100> to<00:02:45.640> them<00:02:46.080> we<00:02:47.080> did<00:02:47.230> that<00:02:47.440> and<00:02:48.090> just<00:02:49.090> the

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
weight to them we did that and just the

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.570 
weight to them we did that and just the
overall<00:02:49.360> focus<00:02:49.930> or<00:02:50.080> the<00:02:50.200> concussion<00:02:50.680> who<00:02:51.460> us

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
overall focus or the concussion who us

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.570 
overall focus or the concussion who us
to<00:02:51.880> get<00:02:52.120> this<00:02:52.300> massive<00:02:53.580> larger-than-life

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
to get this massive larger-than-life

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.460 
to get this massive larger-than-life
sound<00:02:55.120> greedy<00:02:55.360> I<00:02:55.630> mean<00:02:55.810> really<00:02:55.959> if<00:02:56.200> I<00:02:56.320> could

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
sound greedy I mean really if I could

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.010 
sound greedy I mean really if I could
compare<00:02:56.740> to<00:02:56.860> anything<00:02:57.070> it<00:02:57.340> would<00:02:57.459> be<00:02:57.640> a<00:02:58.020> movie

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 
compare to anything it would be a movie

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.770 
compare to anything it would be a movie
