00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
terrific gas for preserving wine in its

terrific gas for preserving wine in its
freshest<00:01:46.680> state<00:01:46.950> it's<00:01:47.759> inert<00:01:48.090> it's<00:01:49.020> insoluble

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
freshest state it's inert it's insoluble

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.520 
freshest state it's inert it's insoluble
it<00:01:50.610> doesn't<00:01:51.000> dissolve<00:01:51.240> into<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.780> wine<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.380> it

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
it doesn't dissolve into the wine and it

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.590 
it doesn't dissolve into the wine and it
also<00:01:52.649> stops<00:01:53.040> mines<00:01:53.310> from<00:01:53.700> oxidizing<00:01:54.240> and

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
also stops mines from oxidizing and

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.209 
also stops mines from oxidizing and
oxidizing<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.500> real<00:01:55.680> issue<00:01:55.890> with<00:01:56.189> one

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
oxidizing the real issue with one

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.359 
oxidizing the real issue with one
because<00:01:56.729> if<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:57.000> is<00:01:57.090> oxidizes<00:01:57.869> too<00:01:58.049> quickly

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
because if it is oxidizes too quickly

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:00.499 
because if it is oxidizes too quickly
then<00:01:59.369> we're<00:01:59.520> not<00:01:59.610> looking<00:01:59.939> at<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.060> one<00:02:00.240> in<00:02:00.270> its

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
then we're not looking at the one in its

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.450 
then we're not looking at the one in its
best<00:02:00.719> condition<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.380> we<00:02:01.649> want<00:02:01.829> freshness<00:02:02.280> and
