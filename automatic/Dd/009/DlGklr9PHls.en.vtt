automatically convert to a six digit
passcode<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.660> it<00:00:25.410> looks<00:00:25.619> it<00:00:25.859> as<00:00:26.009> of<00:00:26.310> right<00:00:26.550> now

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
passcode and it looks it as of right now

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.230 
passcode and it looks it as of right now
in<00:00:26.970> iOS<00:00:27.330> 9<00:00:27.390> beta<00:00:27.599> one<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.380> answer<00:00:28.769> is<00:00:29.179> no<00:00:30.179> you

passcode and enter our passcode just one
more<00:00:54.330> time<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:55.290> can<00:00:55.470> see<00:00:55.680> there's<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.949> new

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
more time you can see there's a new

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.640 
more time you can see there's a new
button<00:00:56.519> that<00:00:56.879> says<00:00:57.089> password<00:00:57.479> options<00:00:58.379> and

here you can see it says custom

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.350 
here you can see it says custom
alphanumeric<00:01:01.320> code<00:01:01.530> custom<00:01:02.400> numeric<00:01:02.909> code<00:01:03.119> or

six<00:01:04.260> digit<00:01:04.890> numeric<00:01:05.010> code<00:01:05.489> off<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.750> bat

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
six digit numeric code off the bat

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.929 
six digit numeric code off the bat
there's<00:01:07.229> no<00:01:07.500> option<00:01:08.070> for<00:01:08.100> four<00:01:08.549> digits

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
there's no option for four digits

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.420 
there's no option for four digits
because<00:01:09.210> you<00:01:09.330> can<00:01:09.479> see<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:09.960> by<00:01:10.110> default<00:01:10.430> four

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
because you can see that by default four

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.490 
because you can see that by default four
digits<00:01:11.880> still<00:01:12.390> looks<00:01:12.630> like<00:01:12.720> it's<00:01:12.990> going<00:01:13.230> to<00:01:13.350> be

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
digits still looks like it's going to be

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.680 
digits still looks like it's going to be
the<00:01:13.620> way<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.770> go<00:01:14.100> although<00:01:14.460> I<00:01:14.940> have<00:01:15.210> seen<00:01:15.450> some

if you are simply upgrading your device
from<00:01:27.300> iOS<00:01:27.600> 8<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:28.200> iOS<00:01:28.530> 9<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:29.190> should<00:01:29.820> still<00:01:30.120> be

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
from iOS 8 to iOS 9 you should still be

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.930 
from iOS 8 to iOS 9 you should still be
able<00:01:30.330> to<00:01:30.510> use<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.840> four<00:01:31.230> digit<00:01:31.380> passcode<00:01:31.940> this

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 
able to use a four digit passcode this

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.430 
able to use a four digit passcode this
is<00:01:33.060> also<00:01:33.360> kind<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.600> interesting<00:01:34.080> because<00:01:34.200> of

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
is also kind of interesting because of

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.260 
is also kind of interesting because of
course<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.800> custom<00:01:35.220> alphanumeric<00:01:35.940> code<00:01:36.120> is

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
course the custom alphanumeric code is

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.210 
course the custom alphanumeric code is
just<00:01:36.870> like<00:01:37.050> they've<00:01:37.200> had<00:01:37.380> on<00:01:37.409> many<00:01:37.740> previous

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
versions of iOS you can use letters

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.010 
versions of iOS you can use letters
numbers<00:01:39.780> all<00:01:40.520> kinds<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.580> stuff<00:01:41.820> new<00:01:42.750> things

here though are not only the six digit
passcode<00:01:45.270> but<00:01:45.750> there's<00:01:45.900> actually<00:01:46.440> a<00:01:46.470> custom

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
passcode but there's actually a custom

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.399 
passcode but there's actually a custom
numeric<00:01:47.909> code<00:01:48.120> now<00:01:48.540> this<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:48.930> pretty<00:01:49.170> cool

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
numeric code now this is pretty cool

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.440 
numeric code now this is pretty cool
because<00:01:49.620> iOS<00:01:50.159> 9<00:01:50.370> actually<00:01:50.940> gives<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.300> the

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
because iOS 9 actually gives you the

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.630 
because iOS 9 actually gives you the
option<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:52.080> use<00:01:52.320> as<00:01:52.620> many<00:01:53.040> or<00:01:53.190> as<00:01:53.430> little

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
option to use as many or as little

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.940 
option to use as many or as little
digits<00:01:54.360> in<00:01:54.540> a<00:01:54.780> number<00:01:55.080> passcode<00:01:55.500> as<00:01:55.620> you<00:01:55.710> one

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
digits in a number passcode as you one

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.370 
digits in a number passcode as you one
if<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:57.120> just<00:01:57.450> want<00:01:57.690> one<00:01:57.840> numbers<00:01:58.200> your

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
if you just want one numbers your

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.590 
if you just want one numbers your
passcode<00:01:58.770> for<00:01:59.070> example<00:01:59.430> one<00:01:59.670> you<00:02:00.390> can

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
passcode for example one you can

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.840 
passcode for example one you can
actually<00:02:00.810> do<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:01.380> in<00:02:01.440> iOS<00:02:01.950> 9<00:02:02.010> now<00:02:02.610> if<00:02:02.729> you're

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
actually do that in iOS 9 now if you're

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.070 
actually do that in iOS 9 now if you're
wondering<00:02:03.030> how<00:02:03.299> that<00:02:03.360> looks<00:02:03.690> on<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.900> lock

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
wondering how that looks on the lock

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.500 
wondering how that looks on the lock
screen<00:02:04.380> as<00:02:04.620> I<00:02:04.650> know<00:02:04.950> I<00:02:05.100> was<00:02:05.490> it<00:02:06.000> won't<00:02:06.270> actually

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
screen as I know I was it won't actually

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.109 
screen as I know I was it won't actually
give<00:02:06.930> away<00:02:06.960> how<00:02:07.530> many<00:02:07.740> digits<00:02:07.950> your<00:02:08.549> custom

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
give away how many digits your custom

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.809 
give away how many digits your custom
numeric<00:02:09.629> code<00:02:09.840> is<00:02:10.140> it<00:02:10.890> could<00:02:11.129> be<00:02:11.250> I<00:02:11.280> guess<00:02:11.580> from

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
numeric code is it could be I guess from

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.550 
numeric code is it could be I guess from
one<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.269> a<00:02:12.299> thousand<00:02:12.840> but<00:02:12.959> it's<00:02:13.110> still<00:02:13.319> going

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
one to a thousand but it's still going

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.860 
one to a thousand but it's still going
to<00:02:13.590> show<00:02:13.709> you<00:02:13.890> this<00:02:14.190> box<00:02:14.489> right<00:02:14.879> here<00:02:15.180> and<00:02:15.330> it's

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
to show you this box right here and it's

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.599 
to show you this box right here and it's
not<00:02:16.080> going<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.409> show<00:02:16.560> you<00:02:16.620> how<00:02:16.830> many<00:02:17.010> digits<00:02:17.400> so

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:17.609 
not going to show you how many digits so

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:19.489 
not going to show you how many digits so
if<00:02:17.730> you<00:02:17.849> do<00:02:18.029> have<00:02:18.239> just<00:02:18.569> a<00:02:18.659> one<00:02:18.930> digit<00:02:19.170> passcode

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:19.499 
if you do have just a one digit passcode

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:21.920 
if you do have just a one digit passcode
it's<00:02:20.040> not<00:02:20.579> going<00:02:20.849> to<00:02:20.939> show<00:02:21.090> one<00:02:21.329> bubble

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
it's not going to show one bubble

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.289 
it's not going to show one bubble
obviously<00:02:22.620> then<00:02:23.280> it<00:02:23.400> would<00:02:23.519> be<00:02:23.640> incredibly

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
obviously then it would be incredibly

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:26.330 
obviously then it would be incredibly
easy<00:02:24.390> for<00:02:24.780> someone<00:02:25.260> to<00:02:25.530> know<00:02:25.680> if<00:02:25.950> you're<00:02:26.099> using

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
easy for someone to know if you're using

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.819 
easy for someone to know if you're using
this<00:02:26.610> custom<00:02:26.909> numeric<00:02:27.480> passcode<00:02:27.989> how<00:02:28.650> many

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:28.829 
this custom numeric passcode how many

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:30.470 
this custom numeric passcode how many
attempts<00:02:29.250> that<00:02:29.370> they<00:02:29.459> have<00:02:29.670> to<00:02:29.849> try<00:02:30.120> to<00:02:30.150> get

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
attempts that they have to try to get

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.789 
attempts that they have to try to get
into<00:02:30.659> your<00:02:30.689> phone<00:02:30.930> so<00:02:31.170> it's<00:02:31.290> a<00:02:31.349> pretty<00:02:31.530> cool

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:31.799 
into your phone so it's a pretty cool

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.039 
into your phone so it's a pretty cool
security<00:02:32.400> feature<00:02:32.610> there<00:02:32.970> the<00:02:33.659> final

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
security feature there the final

digit<00:02:37.799> pass<00:02:37.980> codes<00:02:38.310> this<00:02:39.120> is<00:02:39.299> kind<00:02:39.540> of

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
digit pass codes this is kind of

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.059 
digit pass codes this is kind of
interesting<00:02:39.870> because<00:02:40.260> like<00:02:40.590> I<00:02:40.680> mentioned

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
interesting because like I mentioned

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.099 
interesting because like I mentioned
earlier<00:02:41.159> some<00:02:41.640> people<00:02:42.000> said<00:02:42.269> that<00:02:42.450> when<00:02:43.019> they

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:43.109 
earlier some people said that when they

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:44.569 
earlier some people said that when they
were<00:02:43.140> setting<00:02:43.470> up<00:02:43.620> their<00:02:43.799> iPhone<00:02:44.189> after<00:02:44.400> a

clean restore on iOS 9 it suggested for

which is pretty awesome if you ask me I
don't<00:03:13.260> think<00:03:13.319> I'll<00:03:13.560> be<00:03:13.680> enabling<00:03:14.129> six<00:03:14.430> digit

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730

just<00:03:17.159> because<00:03:17.489> I'm<00:03:17.670> not<00:03:17.700> really<00:03:18.090> worried

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
just because I'm not really worried

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.809 
just because I'm not really worried
about<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:19.290> overall<00:03:19.620> security<00:03:20.370> or<00:03:20.489> someone

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
about the overall security or someone

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.119 
about the overall security or someone
typing<00:03:21.269> in<00:03:21.359> a<00:03:21.420> passcode<00:03:21.870> to<00:03:22.079> hack<00:03:22.650> my<00:03:22.859> device
