00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.720 

okay<00:00:05.319> I've<00:00:05.440> got<00:00:05.470> a<00:00:05.620> few<00:00:05.920> things<00:00:06.100> here<00:00:06.460> that<00:00:06.490> I

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:06.730 
okay I've got a few things here that I

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:07.920 
okay I've got a few things here that I
thought<00:00:07.060> might<00:00:07.330> need<00:00:07.540> a<00:00:07.569> bit<00:00:07.840> of

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:07.930 
thought might need a bit of

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:14.070 
thought might need a bit of
clarification<00:00:12.510> when<00:00:13.510> removing<00:00:13.990> that

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:14.080 
clarification when removing that

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.310 
clarification when removing that
transmission<00:00:15.299> there's<00:00:16.299> this<00:00:16.539> transmission

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:17.320 
transmission there's this transmission

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.339 
transmission there's this transmission
mount<00:00:17.560> that<00:00:18.279> mounts<00:00:18.850> to<00:00:18.880> the<00:00:19.140> differential<00:00:20.140> so

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:20.349 
mount that mounts to the differential so

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:22.859 
mount that mounts to the differential so
these<00:00:20.470> are<00:00:20.679> the<00:00:20.830> three<00:00:21.099> bolts<00:00:21.519> that<00:00:22.480> I<00:00:22.539> took

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:22.869 
these are the three bolts that I took

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.150 
these are the three bolts that I took
off<00:00:23.080> and<00:00:24.179> this<00:00:25.179> one<00:00:25.419> here<00:00:25.689> is<00:00:25.869> the<00:00:25.900> upper<00:00:26.410> one<00:00:26.650> I

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.160 
off and this one here is the upper one I

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.700 
off and this one here is the upper one I
believe<00:00:27.789> I<00:00:27.910> use<00:00:28.089> a<00:00:28.119> 17<00:00:28.720> millimeter<00:00:28.960> sometimes

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:29.710 
believe I use a 17 millimeter sometimes

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.700 
believe I use a 17 millimeter sometimes
they're<00:00:29.890> 16<00:00:30.400> and<00:00:31.179> what<00:00:31.749> can<00:00:31.869> also<00:00:32.020> happen<00:00:32.200> is

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 
they're 16 and what can also happen is

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.250 
they're 16 and what can also happen is
that<00:00:32.829> this<00:00:33.040> bolt<00:00:33.370> will<00:00:33.490> just<00:00:33.850> spin<00:00:34.260> because

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
that this bolt will just spin because

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.400 
that this bolt will just spin because
the<00:00:35.410> inside<00:00:35.920> of<00:00:36.219> the<00:00:36.309> amount<00:00:36.760> is<00:00:36.969> spinning<00:00:37.410> in

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:38.410 
the inside of the amount is spinning in

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.250 
the inside of the amount is spinning in
which<00:00:38.680> case<00:00:38.920> it<00:00:39.129> can<00:00:39.280> be<00:00:39.399> a<00:00:39.430> pain<00:00:39.699> to<00:00:39.910> remove<00:00:40.260> so

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
which case it can be a pain to remove so

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.920 
which case it can be a pain to remove so
the<00:00:41.440> next<00:00:41.800> best<00:00:42.070> thing<00:00:42.250> to<00:00:42.699> do<00:00:43.180> is<00:00:43.449> when<00:00:43.750> it's

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
the next best thing to do is when it's

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.750 
the next best thing to do is when it's
installed<00:00:44.350> in<00:00:44.710> the<00:00:44.800> engine<00:00:45.100> like<00:00:45.280> this<00:00:45.460> or<00:00:45.670> in

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
installed in the engine like this or in

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.410 
installed in the engine like this or in
there<00:00:45.969> in<00:00:46.239> the<00:00:46.510> engine<00:00:46.960> bay<00:00:47.250> remove<00:00:48.250> the<00:00:48.489> 2<00:00:48.940> 13

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
there in the engine bay remove the 2 13

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.000 
there in the engine bay remove the 2 13
millimeter<00:00:49.899> bolts<00:00:50.350> and<00:00:50.530> then<00:00:50.620> this<00:00:50.769> whole

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
millimeter bolts and then this whole

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.500 
millimeter bolts and then this whole
assembly<00:00:51.370> comes<00:00:51.820> out<00:00:52.090> just<00:00:52.359> just<00:00:52.719> like<00:00:53.140> this

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
assembly comes out just just like this

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.889 
assembly comes out just just like this
and<00:00:55.510> it's<00:00:56.440> supposed<00:00:57.039> to<00:00:57.280> come<00:00:57.579> out<00:00:57.730> just<00:00:58.090> the

00:00:58.889 --> 00:00:58.899 
and it's supposed to come out just the

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:02.549 
and it's supposed to come out just the
bracket<00:00:59.320> by<00:00:59.500> itself<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:01.989> that's<00:01:02.170> the<00:01:02.379> one

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
bracket by itself so that's the one

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:05.160 
bracket by itself so that's the one
thing<00:01:02.829> and<00:01:03.330> the<00:01:04.330> other<00:01:04.390> thing<00:01:04.690> that<00:01:04.720> I<00:01:04.839> tried

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
thing and the other thing that I tried

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.020 
thing and the other thing that I tried
didn't<00:01:05.800> show<00:01:06.450> completely<00:01:07.450> were<00:01:07.720> these

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
didn't show completely were these

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.000 
didn't show completely were these
shifter<00:01:10.030> links<00:01:10.360> and<00:01:10.630> how<00:01:10.930> do<00:01:10.990> you<00:01:11.110> how<00:01:11.860> they

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.010 
shifter links and how do you how they

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.340 
shifter links and how do you how they
operate<00:01:12.460> and<00:01:12.580> how<00:01:12.760> they<00:01:12.820> come<00:01:13.090> off<00:01:13.350> basically

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
operate and how they come off basically

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.610 
operate and how they come off basically
it's<00:01:14.740> just<00:01:14.800> a<00:01:15.010> ball<00:01:15.190> socket<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:16.810> put<00:01:17.200> that

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:17.620 
it's just a ball socket that put that

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.460 
it's just a ball socket that put that
pushes<00:01:18.310> onto<00:01:18.670> the<00:01:18.790> or<00:01:19.330> a<00:01:19.570> cup<00:01:19.930> that<00:01:19.960> pushes

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
pushes onto the or a cup that pushes

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.680 
pushes onto the or a cup that pushes
onto<00:01:20.620> the<00:01:20.860> ball<00:01:21.040> and<00:01:21.220> then<00:01:22.000> this<00:01:22.150> plastic

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:22.690 
onto the ball and then this plastic

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.870 
onto the ball and then this plastic
retainer<00:01:23.110> closes<00:01:23.770> around<00:01:24.100> it<00:01:24.340> and<00:01:24.520> that

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
retainer closes around it and that

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:31.200 
retainer closes around it and that
creates<00:01:25.120> a<00:01:25.510> solid<00:01:27.090> seal<00:01:28.090> or<00:01:28.770> snug<00:01:29.770> fit<00:01:30.160> so<00:01:30.970> what

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
creates a solid seal or snug fit so what

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.810 
creates a solid seal or snug fit so what
you<00:01:31.330> saw<00:01:31.540> me<00:01:31.720> do<00:01:31.900> is<00:01:32.140> use<00:01:32.950> a<00:01:32.980> small<00:01:33.430> screwdriver

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
you saw me do is use a small screwdriver

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.620 
you saw me do is use a small screwdriver
and<00:01:34.540> all<00:01:34.690> I<00:01:34.720> did<00:01:34.900> was<00:01:35.490> wedge<00:01:36.490> this<00:01:36.760> arm<00:01:37.120> open

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
and all I did was wedge this arm open

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.100 
and all I did was wedge this arm open
like<00:01:38.470> this<00:01:38.770> and<00:01:39.580> with<00:01:40.180> it<00:01:40.330> open<00:01:40.510> you<00:01:40.810> can<00:01:40.960> then

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
like this and with it open you can then

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.970 
like this and with it open you can then
go<00:01:41.320> underneath<00:01:42.280> it<00:01:43.440> apply<00:01:44.440> a<00:01:44.470> little<00:01:44.740> bit<00:01:44.860> of

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:44.980 
go underneath it apply a little bit of

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.500 
go underneath it apply a little bit of
pressure<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:46.360> it<00:01:46.660> pops<00:01:46.900> off<00:01:47.110> the<00:01:47.320> ball<00:01:48.390> so<00:01:49.390> you

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
pressure and it pops off the ball so you

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.080 
pressure and it pops off the ball so you
can<00:01:49.630> see<00:01:49.810> here<00:01:50.080> it's<00:01:50.200> the<00:01:50.710> plastic<00:01:51.160> piece<00:01:51.370> it's

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
can see here it's the plastic piece it's

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.800 
can see here it's the plastic piece it's
just<00:01:52.270> a<00:01:52.330> split<00:01:52.720> there's<00:01:53.470> a<00:01:53.530> split<00:01:53.800> here<00:01:54.160> and

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
just a split there's a split here and

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.530 
just a split there's a split here and
when<00:01:55.810> it<00:01:55.930> sits<00:01:56.080> over<00:01:56.830> the<00:01:56.950> ball<00:01:57.160> you<00:01:57.540> close

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
when it sits over the ball you close

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.960 
when it sits over the ball you close
this<00:01:58.840> or<00:01:59.080> you<00:01:59.230> pinch<00:01:59.500> it<00:01:59.710> and<00:01:59.860> so<00:02:00.430> it<00:02:00.580> cannot

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
this or you pinch it and so it cannot

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.580 
this or you pinch it and so it cannot
spread<00:02:01.510> and<00:02:01.840> that<00:02:02.170> creates<00:02:02.680> a<00:02:02.800> solid<00:02:03.040> fear<00:02:03.580> fit

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
spread and that creates a solid fear fit

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.380 
spread and that creates a solid fear fit
so<00:02:05.590> again<00:02:05.890> it's<00:02:06.430> just<00:02:06.550> a<00:02:06.790> matter<00:02:06.970> of

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:13.110 

spreading<00:02:11.290> the<00:02:11.530> little<00:02:11.770> plastic<00:02:11.980> tab<00:02:12.520> once<00:02:12.910> is

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
spreading the little plastic tab once is

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.120 
spreading the little plastic tab once is
when<00:02:13.510> it's<00:02:13.660> on<00:02:13.840> like<00:02:14.110> this<00:02:14.320> and<00:02:14.590> again<00:02:14.890> there's

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
when it's on like this and again there's

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.830 
when it's on like this and again there's
a<00:02:15.190> second<00:02:15.610> one<00:02:15.700> this<00:02:15.940> one<00:02:16.090> here<00:02:16.270> is<00:02:16.360> black<00:02:16.600> this

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
a second one this one here is black this

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.810 
a second one this one here is black this
one's<00:02:17.080> white<00:02:17.350> slightly<00:02:18.190> different<00:02:18.430> lengths

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
one's white slightly different lengths

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.960 
one's white slightly different lengths
different<00:02:19.360> application<00:02:19.990> so<00:02:20.860> same<00:02:21.130> thing<00:02:21.430> you

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
different application so same thing you

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.180 
different application so same thing you
take<00:02:22.270> your<00:02:22.420> screwdriver<00:02:22.690> you<00:02:23.620> spread<00:02:24.010> the

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
take your screwdriver you spread the

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.610 
take your screwdriver you spread the
little<00:02:24.460> plastic<00:02:24.910> piece<00:02:25.210> and<00:02:25.570> then<00:02:26.380> you<00:02:26.410> go

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
little plastic piece and then you go

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.590 
little plastic piece and then you go
from<00:02:26.770> underneath<00:02:27.100> and<00:02:27.520> you<00:02:28.090> just<00:02:28.300> wedge

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
from underneath and you just wedge

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:36.410 
from underneath and you just wedge
against<00:02:29.530> it<00:02:32.160> and<00:02:33.160> that<00:02:33.690> pops<00:02:34.690> it<00:02:34.900> off<00:02:35.050> the<00:02:35.620> ball

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
against it and that pops it off the ball

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.050 
against it and that pops it off the ball
sometimes<00:02:37.420> they<00:02:37.900> do<00:02:37.959> break<00:02:38.350> they<00:02:39.220> split<00:02:39.910> along

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
sometimes they do break they split along

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.080 
sometimes they do break they split along
the<00:02:40.360> housing<00:02:40.840> here<00:02:41.170> where<00:02:41.950> that<00:02:42.000> where<00:02:43.000> the

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
the housing here where that where the

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.330 
the housing here where that where the
seam<00:02:43.360> is<00:02:43.410> because<00:02:44.410> the<00:02:44.530> seam<00:02:44.740> doesn't<00:02:44.980> extend

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
seam is because the seam doesn't extend

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.120 
seam is because the seam doesn't extend
all<00:02:45.550> the<00:02:45.580> way<00:02:45.760> down<00:02:46.140> but<00:02:47.140> over<00:02:47.260> time<00:02:47.620> it<00:02:48.070> does

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
all the way down but over time it does

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.890 
all the way down but over time it does
break<00:02:48.700> and<00:02:49.120> then<00:02:49.239> for<00:02:49.840> the<00:02:50.320> little<00:02:50.620> locking

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
break and then for the little locking

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.240 
break and then for the little locking
the<00:02:52.900> little<00:02:53.200> locking<00:02:53.620> tab<00:02:53.890> can<00:02:54.190> break<00:02:54.430> off

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
the little locking tab can break off

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.190 
the little locking tab can break off
this<00:02:57.250> guy<00:02:57.459> here<00:02:57.820> so<00:02:58.390> then<00:02:58.540> once<00:02:58.780> this<00:02:58.989> guy<00:02:59.140> is

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
this guy here so then once this guy is

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.920 
this guy here so then once this guy is
broken<00:02:59.800> off<00:03:00.040> it<00:03:00.550> no<00:03:00.790> longer<00:03:00.970> can<00:03:01.540> retain

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
broken off it no longer can retain

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.770 
broken off it no longer can retain
tension<00:03:02.530> on<00:03:02.680> these<00:03:02.860> two<00:03:03.130> pieces<00:03:03.550> or<00:03:04.450> on<00:03:04.630> this

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
tension on these two pieces or on this

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.890 
tension on these two pieces or on this
one<00:03:04.989> piece<00:03:05.260> the<00:03:05.440> coal<00:03:05.680> to<00:03:06.010> hold<00:03:06.190> it<00:03:06.340> together

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
one piece the coal to hold it together

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.530 
one piece the coal to hold it together
so<00:03:08.350> anyways<00:03:08.739> that's<00:03:08.950> it<00:03:09.160> so<00:03:09.459> you<00:03:09.970> saw<00:03:10.209> me<00:03:10.390> take

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
so anyways that's it so you saw me take

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.310 
so anyways that's it so you saw me take
that<00:03:10.570> off<00:03:11.220> talked<00:03:12.220> about<00:03:12.459> that<00:03:12.810> and<00:03:13.810> this<00:03:14.170> is

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
that off talked about that and this is

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.860 
that off talked about that and this is
that<00:03:14.500> cooling<00:03:14.920> pipe<00:03:15.220> and<00:03:15.580> the<00:03:16.180> front<00:03:16.480> engine

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
that cooling pipe and the front engine

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.500 
that cooling pipe and the front engine
mount<00:03:17.080> or<00:03:17.380> the<00:03:17.650> bracket<00:03:18.100> and<00:03:18.549> there<00:03:19.390> was<00:03:19.480> a

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
mount or the bracket and there was a

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.280 
mount or the bracket and there was a
little<00:03:19.690> 10<00:03:19.959> millimeter<00:03:20.410> bolt<00:03:21.000> so<00:03:22.000> I<00:03:22.450> was

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
little 10 millimeter bolt so I was

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.740 
little 10 millimeter bolt so I was
looking<00:03:23.590> at<00:03:23.739> it<00:03:23.890> like<00:03:24.010> this<00:03:24.250> from<00:03:24.489> above<00:03:24.850> and

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
looking at it like this from above and

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.750 
looking at it like this from above and
there's<00:03:25.989> a<00:03:26.049> 10<00:03:26.290> millimeter<00:03:26.680> bolt<00:03:27.010> that<00:03:27.730> you

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
there's a 10 millimeter bolt that you

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.330 
there's a 10 millimeter bolt that you
have<00:03:28.060> to<00:03:28.209> take<00:03:28.420> out<00:03:28.660> so<00:03:29.500> that<00:03:29.650> this<00:03:29.799> pipe<00:03:30.100> is

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
have to take out so that this pipe is

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.670 
have to take out so that this pipe is
free<00:03:30.670> from<00:03:30.910> this<00:03:31.060> bracket<00:03:31.660> the<00:03:32.080> pipe<00:03:32.320> itself

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
free from this bracket the pipe itself

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.350 
free from this bracket the pipe itself
won't<00:03:33.010> move<00:03:33.190> because<00:03:33.430> it's<00:03:33.670> attached<00:03:34.000> to<00:03:34.209> the

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
won't move because it's attached to the

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.720 
won't move because it's attached to the
engine<00:03:34.540> the<00:03:34.930> cylinder<00:03:35.290> head<00:03:35.470> here<00:03:35.830> and

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
engine the cylinder head here and

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.310 
engine the cylinder head here and
obviously<00:03:36.880> the<00:03:37.180> coolant<00:03:37.570> hose<00:03:37.690> is<00:03:37.930> done<00:03:38.140> by

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
obviously the coolant hose is done by

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.680 
obviously the coolant hose is done by
going<00:03:38.830> towards<00:03:39.250> the<00:03:39.370> water<00:03:39.580> pump

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
going towards the water pump

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.630 
going towards the water pump
but<00:03:41.140> once<00:03:41.290> that<00:03:41.470> bolt<00:03:41.680> is<00:03:41.860> out<00:03:42.070> this<00:03:42.340> Brockie

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
but once that bolt is out this Brockie

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.320 
but once that bolt is out this Brockie
can<00:03:43.000> be<00:03:43.120> taken<00:03:43.450> out<00:03:44.670> hope<00:03:45.670> that<00:03:45.700> cleared<00:03:46.180> up

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
can be taken out hope that cleared up

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.630 
can be taken out hope that cleared up
some<00:03:46.570> things<00:03:46.870> any<00:03:47.650> questions<00:03:48.190> feel<00:03:48.400> free<00:03:48.459> to
