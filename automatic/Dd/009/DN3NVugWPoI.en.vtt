00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.390
 according to the report of the commission 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.460
 national water cold front number 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.829

 coahuila new lion and tamaulipas added 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:31.220
 at the entrance of ocean moisture 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.050
 pacific and gulf of mexico provoked 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.320
 intense rains in the area that were 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.269
 from 75 to 150 millimeters with showers 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.519
 thunderstorms hailed and 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:42.710
 strong winds in city valleys in the 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:44.780
 period from 6 to 9 in the morning that 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.699
 they have cut the steps of the communities 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.680
 of the indigenous zone when exceeding the water 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:50.120
 of the Puente de las Cruces bridge in the 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.949
 tomorrow news we talk with the 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.140
 director of civil protection and this was 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:55.699
 what advanced us well then is a 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.769
 rather peculiar phenomenon is that 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.059
 we are living are around nine 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:01.359
 and a half in the morning and it looks like it's 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.359
 night 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.030
 progressing with these goals 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.860
 observing what we are with the 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.050
 previous reform of the previous 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.490
 has been submitted 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.490
 something else 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.060
 the step because this 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.330
 going up the street on the street 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.230
 reform tells us he 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.790
 and that other types of information have 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.540
 with respect to these heavy rains 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.540
 since early morning 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:38.119
 the colony by the same ipad format 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.060
 Now let's go in front of the glass 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.189
 adductors 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.409
 the 11 is for what is the are 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:47.189
 indigenous is right now I go with the 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.189
 licensed let's go 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:57.950
 with the heat then what it marks 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.679
 we will wait the next few 

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:07.170
 equation of study and the rain and the 

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:11.179
 weather put here comes still a little 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.179
 more data water here what we gain 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.010
 and that is not being reinforced for 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.709
 to be able to go to those who are us 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.950
 and municipal police public works 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:24.370
 we already started to move the new 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.370
 stop 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:31.830
 because there is alert in the lower parts of 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.630
 the city in columns in those sectors 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.460
 that you already have well identified 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.350
 but right now they are not 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.720
 reported to us we are checking 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:44.330
 now but I think 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.330
 a little bit of programmed then 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.730
 how many more hours finally how many are 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.350
 hands waiting for rain 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.250
 how many more hours tentatively we 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:03:03.120
 They wait for rain all day 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:06.840

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.020
 note that some schools resulted 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.060
 affected when the water was 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.550
