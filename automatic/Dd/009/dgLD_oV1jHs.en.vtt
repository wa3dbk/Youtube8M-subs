00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:19.119
 sito tj and I bring you a luke gameplay 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.040
 town vale is a video tutorial in which 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.720
 let's say where is the situation of 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.689
 the three bears to make the easter ec of 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.200
 nu how bears and how to activate 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:29.860
 song 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.410
 the first thing we have to do 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.270
 is to open doors to earn points 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.760
 and to open four doors that are going 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:40.789
 to do we are going to be necessary 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.789
 to find the three places where the 

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:47.180
 we are going to do the situation of the prisoners 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:49.640
 make points to bag for those who do not 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:53.300
 you know ya tell you never town has left 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:55.070
 was quite serious as soon as the 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.129
 call of duty black or is not what happens 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.049
 is that this week they have put it on xbox 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:05.570
 for those who do not have the season pass 

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:09.800
 for sale costs 399 are not 410 104 euros 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.840
 in play and I tell you how I do not have the 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.030
 I bought 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.100
 and for those who did not know and where 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.719
 are the three bears right now not 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.850
 I will say then and arctic what not 

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:22.429
 we have to do is open doors in 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.869
 total on door we will not leave 3500 

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:25.880
 so we're going to have to do a lot 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.579
 points can be a bit heavy 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.539
 first rounds since the zombies 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:34.009
 come slow and few come so 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:37.939
 I tell you if you have any problems 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:39.679
 regarding ammunition or what is that 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:42.770
 they leave bonuses with respect to low 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:45.380
 instant double score or 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:49.189
 minimally the Eurovision bonus 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.200
 do not worry about taking a box or taking 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:54.349
 a wall gun quietly to six 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.170
 points as you know the first first 

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:59.929
 solitude comes the rival quid if you play at 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.490
 an individual game in the central zone 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:04.220
 where are we now 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.100
 if you see that he can not stand it is for any 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.959
 thing you get you buy the rival and now 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.400
 later to open the doors to you 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.200
 you worry 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.580
 As you can see here I am making points and 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.460
 I am 1920 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.870
 2000 point that could open what is the 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.760
 first door but I also want 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.880
 buy a wall gun as I eat 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.460
 you see we are in round 2 finishing the and 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.260
 I need ammunition because it does not come out 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:32.020
 then let's catch now he killed this 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.180
 zombie and we go only to the ronde we go to 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.580
 buy the first door plus open the 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.980
 first door and whatever it costs 650 what 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.700
 what to do is buy me the 23 of this 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:44.440
 The elite wall is coming out pretty good 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.950
 it comes out by a thousand if you want to buy yourselves 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:50.080
 the m-14 that goes for luxury or the Olympia 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.690
 you yourselves I fucked up this 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.069
 gun because that blast pretty well 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.010
 and it goes well ammo 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:00.700
 it kills very well 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:03.040
 I say the pipe to the initial gun 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.310
 if you have instant low as well but as 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.110
 you have to wait next round sumo 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.480
 here we open the second door since 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:12.849
 we have money is a door costs 1000 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.769
 we already have that open house that already 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:17.319
 we can access the box in this 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:19.720
 situation the exit leave here if you want 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:21.670
 in green you do not catch a wall gun 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.830
 risk taking box you 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.290
 you will see but there is also a risk that you 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.700
 come out style war machines and things 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.860
 A) Yes 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.440
 that to make points come very badly 

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:35.799
 then you do not know gays take a gun 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.110
 of wall and as you go giving it 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:40.930
 joke the game and killing zombies 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.900
 advancing rounds and you get weapons of 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.000
 box or if you get a rebate of those that 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.840
 for ten you can open any box 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.840
 Well, better than better 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.800
 we have already opened two doors 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.380
 ok let's go doing many more 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.780
 points to open the two that we have left 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.510
 the two that remain are going to be in the 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.610
 opposite house 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.650
 you are going to open here that I open the third 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:08.640
 door this third door is going to cost 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:11.220
 750 and the last one we have left is not a 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:15.480
 door are some debris that go to 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.769
 cost a thousand who are in that house in that 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.470
 house where the third door opened 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:22.109
 climbing the stairs those debris 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.020
 are the ones that we are going to need to open for 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:27.780
 start locating the bears 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:29.370
 sincerely at this time, that is from 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.620
 the beginning you can find us or if 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:32.820
 you want to play it perfect but what 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:35.310
 I'm going to do and it's going to be open all 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.350
 Necessary doors 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.670
 so you can see where the three bears are 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.670
 Wolf already directly 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.550
 Now what I'm doing is opening 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:48.490
 doors leave everything clean and activate 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:51.430
 the bears then at the same moment all 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.889
 suddenly to take it off and do it 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:57.400
 all at the same moment that is what 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:05:01.330
 let's find out where the bears are for 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:03.819

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.310
