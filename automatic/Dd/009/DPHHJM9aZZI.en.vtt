diet and how did it and I followed it

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.850 
diet and how did it and I followed it
exact<00:01:13.500> I<00:01:14.060> think<00:01:15.060> on<00:01:15.360> Tuesday<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.530> was<00:01:16.710> either

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
exact I think on Tuesday it was either

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.350 
exact I think on Tuesday it was either
Tuesday<00:01:17.159> or<00:01:17.340> Wednesday<00:01:17.430> you'll<00:01:17.909> see<00:01:18.150> where<00:01:18.330> I

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
Tuesday or Wednesday you'll see where I

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.240 
Tuesday or Wednesday you'll see where I
gained<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.930> pound<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.500> on<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.920> day<00:01:20.070> before

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
gained a pound and on the day before

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.219 
gained a pound and on the day before
that<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:20.670> only<00:01:20.909> had<00:01:21.180> one<00:01:21.210> bowl<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.659> soup<00:01:21.960> because

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
that I only had one bowl of soup because

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.830 
that I only had one bowl of soup because
I<00:01:22.320> was<00:01:22.439> kind<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.680> sick<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:22.950> soup<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:24.180> I<00:01:24.450> had<00:01:24.630> one

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
I was kind of sick of soup and I had one

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.170 
I was kind of sick of soup and I had one
bowl<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.049> soup<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:25.409> I<00:01:25.590> guess<00:01:25.860> eating<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.939> soup

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
bowl of soup so I guess eating the soup

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.030 
bowl of soup so I guess eating the soup
actually<00:01:27.659> makes<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:27.990> lose<00:01:28.170> some<00:01:28.409> weight<00:01:28.439> also

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
actually makes you lose some weight also

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.649 
actually makes you lose some weight also
so<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.280> guess<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.610> maybe<00:01:29.790> works<00:01:30.060> on<00:01:30.180> a<00:01:30.210> chemical

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
so I guess it maybe works on a chemical

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.830 
so I guess it maybe works on a chemical
breakdown<00:01:30.860> or<00:01:31.860> however<00:01:32.180> but<00:01:33.180> when<00:01:33.360> I<00:01:33.390> saw<00:01:33.720> that

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
breakdown or however but when I saw that

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.230 
breakdown or however but when I saw that
I<00:01:33.930> gained<00:01:34.140> weight<00:01:34.640> from<00:01:35.640> just<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.909> one<00:01:36.060> bowl

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
I gained weight from just the one bowl

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.700 
I gained weight from just the one bowl
of<00:01:36.360> soup<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.840> next<00:01:37.079> day<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.229> turned<00:01:37.500> around<00:01:37.560> and

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
of soup the next day I turned around and

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.160 
of soup the next day I turned around and
I<00:01:37.829> ate<00:01:38.009> like<00:01:38.280> a<00:01:38.549> lot<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:39.000> cabbage<00:01:39.479> soup<00:01:39.689> but<00:01:40.020> it

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
I ate like a lot of cabbage soup but it

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.240 
I ate like a lot of cabbage soup but it
just<00:01:40.320> got<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.619> point<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.890> was<00:01:40.950> just<00:01:41.100> tired

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:49.690 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.520 

yeah<00:05:49.990> so<00:05:50.349> I<00:05:50.379> gained<00:05:50.909> 2.4<00:05:51.909> pounds<00:05:52.180> back<00:05:52.900> of<00:05:53.169> what

yeah so I gained 2.4 pounds back of what

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.580 
yeah so I gained 2.4 pounds back of what
I<00:05:53.560> lost<00:05:53.830> from<00:05:54.340> the<00:05:54.520> cabbage<00:05:54.819> soup<00:05:54.849> diet<00:05:55.590> which

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.559 
I lost from the cabbage soup diet which
I<00:05:56.860> guess<00:05:57.159> it's<00:05:57.699> not<00:05:57.940> just<00:05:58.360> too<00:05:58.870> too<00:05:59.080> bad<00:05:59.259> but

00:06:00.559 --> 00:06:00.569 
I guess it's not just too too bad but

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:04.710 
I guess it's not just too too bad but
it's<00:06:01.569> still<00:06:01.810> I<00:06:02.759> thought<00:06:03.759> it's<00:06:04.090> still<00:06:04.300> smaller

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:04.720 
it's still I thought it's still smaller

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.830 
it's still I thought it's still smaller
than<00:06:04.870> when<00:06:05.830> I<00:06:05.860> started<00:06:06.490> before<00:06:07.270> the<00:06:07.509> cabbage
