00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
for I don't know what I'm going to do

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.410 
for I don't know what I'm going to do
we'll<00:01:25.100> just<00:01:25.250> pop<00:01:25.460> them

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
we'll just pop them

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.020 
we'll just pop them
um<00:01:28.250> sometimes<00:01:29.250> I<00:01:29.340> like<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.490> hold<00:01:29.670> on<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:29.939> the

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
um sometimes I like to hold on to the

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.030 
um sometimes I like to hold on to the
coin<00:01:30.210> I<00:01:30.509> do<00:01:30.570> have<00:01:30.810> king<00:01:31.049> crush<00:01:31.409> which<00:01:31.770> is<00:01:32.009> a

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
coin I do have king crush which is a

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.539 
coin I do have king crush which is a
nine<00:01:32.880> mana<00:01:33.240> for<00:01:33.450> an<00:01:33.570> 88<00:01:34.049> hasty<00:01:34.860> dinosaur<00:01:35.369> with

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
nine mana for an 88 hasty dinosaur with

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.450 
nine mana for an 88 hasty dinosaur with
charge<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.950> sometimes<00:01:37.950> it's<00:01:38.100> cool<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.369> get

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
charge and sometimes it's cool to get

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.810 
charge and sometimes it's cool to get
wins<00:01:38.670> with<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:39.619> if<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:40.799> had<00:01:40.979> more<00:01:41.189> dust<00:01:41.520> I

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
wins with that if I had more dust I

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.999 
wins with that if I had more dust I
would<00:01:42.030> probably<00:01:42.240> scoop<00:01:42.810> up<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.290> faceless

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
would probably scoop up to faceless

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.029 
would probably scoop up to faceless
manipulators<00:01:44.820> I<00:01:45.409> think<00:01:46.409> those<00:01:46.530> costs<00:01:46.740> 400

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 
manipulators I think those costs 400

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:49.310 
manipulators I think those costs 400
though<00:01:47.549> so<00:01:47.789> that's<00:01:47.970> kind<00:01:48.330> of<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.479> steep<00:01:48.899> one<00:01:48.930> for

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
though so that's kind of a steep one for

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.570 
though so that's kind of a steep one for
me<00:01:49.409> right<00:01:49.649> now<00:01:51.350> and<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.799> just<00:01:52.830> spent<00:01:53.250> a<00:01:53.369> lot<00:01:53.549> of

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
me right now and I just spent a lot of

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.490 
me right now and I just spent a lot of
coin<00:01:54.030> or<00:01:54.450> dust<00:01:56.000> hold<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:57.149> but<00:01:57.570> I<00:01:57.840> just<00:01:58.409> hit

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
coin or dust hold that but I just hit

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.180 
coin or dust hold that but I just hit
the<00:01:58.530> misdirection<00:01:59.100> I<00:02:00.770> think<00:02:01.770> I'm<00:02:01.860> going<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.009> do

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
the misdirection I think I'm going to do

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.969 
the misdirection I think I'm going to do
it<00:02:02.780> there's<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.869> good<00:02:04.050> chance<00:02:04.380> that<00:02:04.649> he'll<00:02:04.800> hit

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
it there's a good chance that he'll hit

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.490 
it there's a good chance that he'll hit
one<00:02:05.159> of<00:02:05.280> his<00:02:05.399> two<00:02:05.640> ones<00:02:08.989> otherwise<00:02:09.989> I<00:02:10.170> could<00:02:10.380> go

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
one of his two ones otherwise I could go

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.259 
one of his two ones otherwise I could go
animal<00:02:10.920> companion<00:02:11.519> that<00:02:11.700> would<00:02:11.819> be<00:02:11.940> like<00:02:12.090> the

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.830 
too but I still think it's a dumb time
to<00:03:36.570> use<00:03:36.720> it<00:03:37.700> but<00:03:38.700> if<00:03:38.820> not<00:03:38.940> now<00:03:39.180> when<00:03:39.209> kind<00:03:39.750> of

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
to use it but if not now when kind of

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:40.970 
to use it but if not now when kind of
thing<00:03:40.020> because<00:03:40.350> everything<00:03:40.709> is<00:03:40.830> just

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
thing because everything is just

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:49.010 
thing because everything is just
chipping<00:03:41.220> away<00:03:41.490> at<00:03:41.670> me<00:03:44.390> so<00:03:45.390> I<00:03:47.840> don't<00:03:48.840> want<00:03:48.959> to
