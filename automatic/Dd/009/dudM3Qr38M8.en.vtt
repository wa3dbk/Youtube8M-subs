00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.969
 hello welcome everyone in a way 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.119
 cooperative special as we are with the 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:11.119
 palace 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.140
 is special is special because the 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.130
 Christmas and the bazaars arrive 

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.960
 technological and we are going to do 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.160
 least let's make a super bazaar of 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.510
 technology but if we're going to talk about 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.500
 telephony that I think the star of 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.230
 this Christmas 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.390
 yes yes exact let's start with samsung 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.520
 we will be talking about the companies more more 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.110
 important and with samsung what happens is 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.120
 that as we did nothing we were talking 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.040
 of know 3 for example that is a 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.379
 phone that I love a tablet 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.510
 therefore we decided to go slightly 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:43.120
 phone is a little earlier why 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.040
 because telephones already have a 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.019
 much higher turnover can last 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.239
 perfectly two years to work very 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:50.680
 well and we also have the advantage that 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:52.330
 if we buy it now because to leave 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.390
 cheaper than at the beginning of the year 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:56.470
 when they arrived at the market 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.320
 are the models that have come out 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:02.080
 long of 2013 but that Christmas is the 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.449
 perfect moment to get 16 are 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.500
 all the models of that 4 we have chosen 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:10.390
 this is the s 4 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.369
 this is the normal and current c 4 that is 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.640
 a gorgeous phone has a design 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:17.470
 very careful the lines that followed the s 3 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.360
 but still less 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.730
 and the truth is that it is very beautiful is almost 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.010
 all screen with aluminum finish and 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.870
 then good the bright plastic a 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.520
 little imitation of perfect metal is 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.250
 well it's pretty good it does not weigh much of 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.650
 a 5-inch screen is fast is 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.790
 powerful has all these functions of 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.460
 those that we have talked a lot also to what 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.740
 year of the recognition of the 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.300
 fungi and so everything everything 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.310
 included samsung basically this is the 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.990
 top of the range the highest range model 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.780
 jackson probably within about 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.250
 months we will see in that cinema 85 but good 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.650
 for now we have this 4 that is 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.500
 very good more models more models 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.119
 this is the active s4 do not worry if 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.920
 you drop it because it resists everything we 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.720
 resists everything is the sanz SUV 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.530
 already accurate inside is very similar to 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.210
 s 4 but but it's a little more robust 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.619
 as we see hold but clear because 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.330
 is made to endure can do 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.509
 pictures under the water and so on is 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:11.490
 a little bit for more adventurous people so that what 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.130
 it's better that he's a little scared 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:18.050
 exact and then we have the for the 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.500
 photographers s 4 zoom 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.910
 as we see has a camera 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.370
 impressive in a camera embedded to 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.230
 the back of 16 megapixels is 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.170
 man can be a little bit more 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.060
 uncomfortable you can hold on well in the 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.040
 pocket will not occupy more is a 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.330
 phone to be a lover of 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.700
 photograph and want to always have a 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.350
 good camera above if now that 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.790
 lately we are replacing a lot 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:41.840
 many of us have replaced the 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.520
 camera we no longer have a digital camera 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.260
 as we already have a phone that makes 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.850
 good pictures this is so you want a 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.120
 little else the only thing that has a 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:52.010
 inconvenience that is that every time to 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.600
 phone you are going to have a camera 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.870
 stuck to your ear you can see a little 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:03:00.620
 crazy but it's fine is Carmen and then 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:02.870
 we already have the mini s4 that the good thing that 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.540
 has because it is traditionally that 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.250
 minis that we have been seeing tend 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.160
 take advantage of the name and be telephones 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.650
 low-end medium if this good one is a 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.620
 mid range but it's practically 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.700
 identical to the c4 the design is 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.860
 practically the same only that instead 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.319
 of 5 inches has 4.3 inches the 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.840
 same as him 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:25.090
 that zoom zoom and inside man 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.870
 it is less powerful but it is up to the task 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:32.799
 it has its dual-core processor 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:34.599
 arose and a half of ram because it can and there 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:37.000
 to say that the samsung mini's 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.739
 this generation are no longer as mini as 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.030
 the andres no longer only had a mobile 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.400
 what you said a mobile that mini 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.069
 they will be a bit of low-end, but 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:48.129
 it is not so minimal at 43 already really 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:52.989
 we can not talk about mini 43 is what 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:55.000
 I had the iphone 4 and now it's the mini 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:56.469
 now in fact we are so 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.359
 used to being in the background big 

00:03:56.469 --> 00:04:01.120
 that seems a small phone does 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:04.030
 a few years it would have seemed great and 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.739
 then well of prices already varies and 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:07.780
 take so long in the market vary 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:12.340
 but good basically we can find 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:14.349
 the s4 and the s4 actress around 450 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.470
 s 4 can go up to 500 and 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:20.079
 while the minimum the mini can be 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:23.919
 find below the 300 looks and 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:26.349
 is the zoom varies by having this is from 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:29.050
 reluctantly 102 clear within the 400 

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:30.909
 euros maybe as always depends on the 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.740
 site is much easier to find 

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:34.810
 in peace in several web pages and even 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.970

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.250
 some of the offers but we're 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.409
 talking about free prices and well then 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.240

 they bleed more next year for good 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:53.590
