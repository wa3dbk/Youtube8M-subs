00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.820 
know his approval rating among blacks is
96<00:01:23.670> 97<00:01:24.180> %<00:01:24.630> which<00:01:24.840> is<00:01:24.960> obviously<00:01:25.290> not<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.619> same

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
96 97 % which is obviously not the same

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.410 
96 97 % which is obviously not the same
as<00:01:26.820> it<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.119> in<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.750> general<00:01:28.049> community

I think with him announcing support of
same-sex<00:01:37.440> marriage<00:01:37.740> it's<00:01:38.460> gonna<00:01:38.760> change<00:01:38.909> the

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
dynamic I don't believe it's gonna be

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.300 
dynamic I don't believe it's gonna be
the<00:01:41.940> same<00:01:42.470> yeah<00:01:43.470> I<00:01:43.500> know<00:01:43.680> that's<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:44.040> big<00:01:44.190> issue

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
judgment

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.270 
judgment
it<00:03:34.480> was<00:03:34.720> important<00:03:35.350> for<00:03:35.380> him<00:03:35.650> to<00:03:35.740> be<00:03:36.010> there

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
it was important for him to be there

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.820 
it was important for him to be there
because<00:03:37.150> she<00:03:37.600> should<00:03:37.930> have<00:03:38.050> been<00:03:38.080> there<00:03:38.500> I

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
because she should have been there I

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.820 
because she should have been there I
think<00:03:39.820> he<00:03:40.420> would<00:03:40.810> have<00:03:40.930> been<00:03:41.170> there<00:03:41.410> had<00:03:41.710> he

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
think he would have been there had he

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.340 
think he would have been there had he
not<00:03:42.040> taken<00:03:42.370> the<00:03:42.640> n-double-a-cp<00:03:43.120> for<00:03:43.750> granted

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
not taken the n-double-a-cp for granted

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.920 
not taken the n-double-a-cp for granted
the<00:03:44.680> n-double-a-cp<00:03:45.250> had<00:03:45.970> handed<00:03:46.600> to<00:03:46.810> the

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
the n-double-a-cp had handed to the

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.380 
the n-double-a-cp had handed to the
president<00:03:47.500> they<00:03:48.130> are<00:03:48.250> doing<00:03:48.640> his<00:03:48.820> wheel<00:03:49.090> by

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
president they are doing his wheel by

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.840 
president they are doing his wheel by
endorsing<00:03:49.720> same-sex<00:03:50.560> marriage<00:03:51.070> and<00:03:51.340> I<00:03:51.790> don't

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
endorsing same-sex marriage and I don't

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:53.910 
endorsing same-sex marriage and I don't
think<00:03:52.270> he<00:03:52.390> counts<00:03:52.870> him<00:03:53.020> as<00:03:53.140> being<00:03:53.320> important

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
think he counts him as being important

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.310 
think he counts him as being important
now<00:03:54.040> because<00:03:54.430> he<00:03:54.550> already<00:03:54.700> has<00:03:55.060> them<00:03:55.390> but<00:03:56.080> if

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
now because he already has them but if

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.700 
now because he already has them but if
you<00:03:56.530> look<00:03:56.770> at<00:03:56.980> why<00:03:57.250> then<00:03:57.730> double<00:03:58.120> AC<00:03:58.480> P<00:03:58.720> voted

00:03:59.700 --> 00:03:59.710 
you look at why then double AC P voted

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.010 
you look at why then double AC P voted
for<00:03:59.920> same-sex<00:04:00.160> marriage

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:02.020 
for same-sex marriage

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.620 
for same-sex marriage
had<00:04:02.410> they<00:04:02.620> led<00:04:02.860> and<00:04:03.490> they<00:04:03.820> left<00:04:04.120> it<00:04:04.330> to<00:04:04.480> the

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
had they led and they left it to the

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.090 
had they led and they left it to the
masses<00:04:04.900> of<00:04:05.170> the<00:04:05.410> members<00:04:05.740> of<00:04:05.830> the<00:04:05.980> n-double

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
masses of the members of the n-double

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.790 
masses of the members of the n-double
a-c-p<00:04:06.400> they<00:04:07.300> would<00:04:07.450> have<00:04:07.570> lost<00:04:07.750> they<00:04:08.440> had<00:04:08.650> to

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:08.800 
a-c-p they would have lost they had to

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.770 
a-c-p they would have lost they had to
do<00:04:08.950> it<00:04:09.070> in<00:04:09.250> the<00:04:09.340> cloak<00:04:09.580> of<00:04:09.730> darkness<00:04:10.000> and<00:04:10.570> I

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
do it in the cloak of darkness and I

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.900 
do it in the cloak of darkness and I
think<00:04:11.140> the<00:04:11.260> president<00:04:11.860> is<00:04:11.950> making<00:04:12.130> a<00:04:12.370> serious

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
think the president is making a serious

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.450 
think the president is making a serious
mistake<00:04:13.050> by<00:04:14.050> taking<00:04:14.320> the<00:04:14.590> black<00:04:14.860> vote<00:04:15.220> for

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:15.460 
mistake by taking the black vote for

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.400 
mistake by taking the black vote for
granted<00:04:15.880> and<00:04:16.030> I<00:04:16.540> think<00:04:16.810> the<00:04:16.930> n-double-a-cp

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
granted and I think the n-double-a-cp

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.750 
granted and I think the n-double-a-cp
has<00:04:18.010> made<00:04:18.280> a<00:04:18.489> serious<00:04:18.880> mistake<00:04:19.260> by<00:04:20.760> pandering

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
has made a serious mistake by pandering

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.970 
has made a serious mistake by pandering
to<00:04:21.880> the<00:04:22.270> president<00:04:22.780> and<00:04:23.050> endorsed<00:04:23.560> the<00:04:23.740> same
