00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
game forward so the characters when we

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.380 
game forward so the characters when we
doing<00:01:11.070> something<00:01:11.610> immediately<00:01:12.030> after<00:01:12.330> you

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
doing something immediately after you

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.800 
doing something immediately after you
switch<00:01:12.630> so<00:01:13.350> it's<00:01:13.500> like<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:13.860> bit<00:01:14.159> more<00:01:14.250> realistic

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
switch so it's like a bit more realistic

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.050 
switch so it's like a bit more realistic
the<00:01:15.810> camera<00:01:16.080> is<00:01:16.229> grainy<00:01:17.070> when<00:01:17.460> pulling<00:01:17.729> into

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
the camera is grainy when pulling into

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.880 
the camera is grainy when pulling into
the<00:01:18.270> google<00:01:18.570> earth<00:01:18.720> style<00:01:19.140> view<00:01:19.500> during<00:01:19.740> the

the google earth style view during the

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.249 
the google earth style view during the
switches<00:01:20.310> so<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.549> like<00:01:20.700> kind<00:01:21.479> of<00:01:21.659> fade<00:01:21.900> in<00:01:22.200> and

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
switches so it like kind of fade in and

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.460 
switches so it like kind of fade in and
fade<00:01:22.380> out<00:01:22.530> with<00:01:22.920> a<00:01:22.950> fuzzy<00:01:23.790> effect<00:01:24.200> though<00:01:25.200> each

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
fade out with a fuzzy effect though each

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.620 
fade out with a fuzzy effect though each
stick<00:01:26.070> broadly<00:01:26.580> speaking<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:27.030> one<00:01:27.210> area<00:01:27.570> of

stick broadly speaking to one area of
the<00:01:27.689> map<00:01:27.900> when<00:01:28.320> you're<00:01:28.439> not<00:01:28.590> controlling<00:01:28.890> them

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
the map when you're not controlling them

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.410 
the map when you're not controlling them
so<00:01:29.310> Michael<00:01:29.610> probably<00:01:29.880> sit<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.119> Rockford

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420
