you should have it you know how many
shapes<00:00:08.099> in<00:00:08.460> a<00:00:08.610> day<00:00:08.820> like<00:00:09.090> what<00:00:09.330> times<00:00:09.599> you

shapes in a day like what times you
should<00:00:09.870> have<00:00:10.170> them<00:00:10.530> how<00:00:11.160> many<00:00:11.340> grams<00:00:11.639> of

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
should have them how many grams of

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.669 
should have them how many grams of
protein<00:00:12.120> you're<00:00:12.630> supposed<00:00:12.870> to<00:00:12.960> have<00:00:13.080> /<00:00:13.349> shake

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
protein you're supposed to have / shake

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.939 
protein you're supposed to have / shake
all<00:00:14.519> that<00:00:14.820> kind<00:00:15.030> of<00:00:15.089> stuff<00:00:15.199> all<00:00:16.199> questions

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
all that kind of stuff all questions

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.580 
all that kind of stuff all questions
that<00:00:17.100> I<00:00:17.160> asked<00:00:17.580> quite<00:00:17.850> frequently<00:00:18.590> probably

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
that I asked quite frequently probably

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.099 
that I asked quite frequently probably
the<00:00:19.680> most<00:00:19.980> frequent<00:00:20.520> one<00:00:20.640> being<00:00:20.880> how<00:00:21.270> many

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
the most frequent one being how many

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.750 
the most frequent one being how many
protein<00:00:22.500> shakes<00:00:22.800> should<00:00:22.980> I<00:00:23.070> have<00:00:23.310> in<00:00:23.490> a<00:00:23.580> day

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
protein shakes should I have in a day

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.150 
protein shakes should I have in a day
and<00:00:24.029> what<00:00:24.990> this<00:00:25.109> really<00:00:25.320> breaks<00:00:25.590> down<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:26.039> is

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
and what this really breaks down to is

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.300 
and what this really breaks down to is
your<00:00:26.310> own<00:00:26.460> dietary<00:00:27.150> needs<00:00:27.650> as<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:28.710> person<00:00:29.279> who

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
your own dietary needs as a person who

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.100 
your own dietary needs as a person who
is<00:00:30.269> say<00:00:30.920> 200<00:00:31.920> pounds<00:00:32.279> for<00:00:32.430> example<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:33.300> would

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
is say 200 pounds for example you would

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.709 
is say 200 pounds for example you would
generally<00:00:35.100> speaking<00:00:35.670> want<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.120> have<00:00:36.239> about<00:00:36.450> 1

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
generally speaking want to have about 1

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.930 
generally speaking want to have about 1
gram<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.170> protein<00:00:37.770> per<00:00:38.010> pound<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:38.579> body<00:00:38.640> weight

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
gram of protein per pound of body weight

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.420 
gram of protein per pound of body weight
and<00:00:39.329> this<00:00:39.840> is<00:00:39.989> including<00:00:40.530> your<00:00:40.649> food<00:00:40.890> sources

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
and this is including your food sources

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.979 
and this is including your food sources
so<00:00:42.090> if<00:00:42.600> you're<00:00:42.840> 200<00:00:43.320> pounds<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:44.520> have<00:00:44.989> six

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
so if you're 200 pounds and you have six

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.290 
so if you're 200 pounds and you have six
chicken<00:00:46.350> breasts<00:00:46.770> will<00:00:47.070> say<00:00:47.309> roughly<00:00:47.730> 25

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
chicken breasts will say roughly 25

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.380 
chicken breasts will say roughly 25
grams<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.930> protein<00:00:49.489> and<00:00:50.489> each<00:00:50.640> chicken<00:00:51.030> breast

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
grams of protein and each chicken breast

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.470 
grams of protein and each chicken breast
so<00:00:52.260> you're<00:00:52.469> looking<00:00:52.800> at<00:00:52.920> what<00:00:53.190> 150<00:00:54.059> grams<00:00:54.300> of

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
so you're looking at what 150 grams of

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.470 
so you're looking at what 150 grams of
protein<00:00:54.719> just<00:00:55.199> from<00:00:55.350> your<00:00:55.469> food<00:00:55.739> sources

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 
protein just from your food sources

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:58.729 
protein just from your food sources
assuming<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.660> was<00:00:57.960> all<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.109> had<00:00:58.350> in

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
assuming that that was all you had in

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.880 
assuming that that was all you had in
the<00:00:58.890> day<00:00:59.120> and<00:01:00.120> not<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.690> pecan<00:01:01.079> for<00:01:01.379> you<00:01:01.530> know<00:01:01.620> yet

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
the day and not a pecan for you know yet

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.250 
the day and not a pecan for you know yet
being<00:01:02.370> about<00:01:02.520> or<00:01:02.640> anything<00:01:02.879> like<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.260> that

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
being about or anything like that that

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.780 
being about or anything like that that
also<00:01:04.439> has<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.799> be<00:01:04.890> accounted<00:01:05.070> for<00:01:05.250> but<00:01:05.549> keeping

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
also has to be accounted for but keeping

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.580 
also has to be accounted for but keeping
it<00:01:05.939> really<00:01:06.090> simple<00:01:06.210> we'll<00:01:07.110> say<00:01:07.260> you've<00:01:07.470> had

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
it really simple we'll say you've had

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.609 
it really simple we'll say you've had
150<00:01:08.310> grams<00:01:08.610> from<00:01:09.090> those<00:01:09.450> chicken<00:01:09.810> breasts<00:01:10.110> any

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
150 grams from those chicken breasts any

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:11.929 
150 grams from those chicken breasts any
other<00:01:10.860> protein<00:01:11.250> powder<00:01:11.490> that<00:01:11.640> gives<00:01:11.820> you

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
other protein powder that gives you

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.050 
other protein powder that gives you
roughly<00:01:12.150> 25<00:01:13.080> grams<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.619> protein<00:01:13.830> per<00:01:14.220> scoop

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
roughly 25 grams of protein per scoop

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.179 
roughly 25 grams of protein per scoop
now<00:01:15.720> what<00:01:16.290> you're<00:01:16.439> looking<00:01:16.710> at<00:01:16.740> here<00:01:16.799> is<00:01:17.070> that

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
now what you're looking at here is that

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.980 
now what you're looking at here is that
obviously<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:17.909> have<00:01:18.030> 50<00:01:18.390> grams<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.780> protein

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
obviously you have 50 grams of protein

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.490 
obviously you have 50 grams of protein
left<00:01:19.439> in<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.710> day<00:01:19.939> to<00:01:20.939> have<00:01:21.150> so<00:01:21.750> you<00:01:22.170> would<00:01:22.290> have

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
left in a day to have so you would have

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.039 
left in a day to have so you would have
two<00:01:22.979> scoops<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.490> protein<00:01:23.640> powder<00:01:24.180> in<00:01:24.570> order<00:01:24.930> to

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
two scoops of protein powder in order to

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.899 
two scoops of protein powder in order to
supplement<00:01:25.259> that<00:01:25.619> in<00:01:26.100> my<00:01:26.580> personal

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
supplement that in my personal

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.420 
supplement that in my personal
experience<00:01:27.720> I<00:01:27.960> haven't<00:01:28.380> found<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:29.340> know

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
you had eggs for breakfast you're a

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.030 
you had eggs for breakfast you're a
chicken<00:03:10.090> breast<00:03:10.180> for<00:03:10.480> lunch<00:03:10.799> so<00:03:11.799> you're<00:03:11.950> at

chicken breast for lunch so you're at
what<00:03:12.459> 50<00:03:12.820> grams<00:03:13.000> of<00:03:13.180> protein<00:03:13.360> and<00:03:13.630> will<00:03:13.750> say

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
what 50 grams of protein and will say

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.830 
what 50 grams of protein and will say
from<00:03:14.290> that<00:03:14.610> you<00:03:15.610> realizing<00:03:16.570> that<00:03:16.600> you<00:03:16.810> know

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
from that you realizing that you know

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.199 
from that you realizing that you know
you're<00:03:17.079> maybe<00:03:17.410> not<00:03:17.530> going<00:03:17.829> to<00:03:17.920> have<00:03:18.100> four<00:03:19.060> more

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
you're maybe not going to have four more

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.449 
you're maybe not going to have four more
chicken<00:03:19.540> roaster<00:03:19.810> dinner<00:03:19.989> so<00:03:20.620> maybe<00:03:20.680> have<00:03:21.070> two

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
chicken roaster dinner so maybe have two

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.100 
chicken roaster dinner so maybe have two
scoops<00:03:21.820> of<00:03:21.970> protein<00:03:22.239> before<00:03:22.720> your<00:03:22.989> workout

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
scoops of protein before your workout

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.759 
scoops of protein before your workout
and<00:03:23.880> you<00:03:24.880> know<00:03:25.060> maybe<00:03:25.600> have<00:03:25.900> your<00:03:26.380> chicken

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
and you know maybe have your chicken

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:28.140 
and you know maybe have your chicken
breast<00:03:26.920> or<00:03:27.040> tissue<00:03:27.250> numbers<00:03:27.549> for<00:03:27.700> dinner<00:03:27.850> and

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
breast or tissue numbers for dinner and

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.910 
breast or tissue numbers for dinner and
then<00:03:28.660> some<00:03:28.840> more<00:03:28.959> protein<00:03:29.380> before<00:03:29.560> you<00:03:29.739> go<00:03:29.860> to

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:29.920 
then some more protein before you go to

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.680 
then some more protein before you go to
bed<00:03:30.010> or<00:03:30.130> whatever<00:03:30.340> you<00:03:30.880> know<00:03:30.910> so<00:03:31.239> it's<00:03:31.269> just

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
bed or whatever you know so it's just

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.509 
bed or whatever you know so it's just
about<00:03:31.930> making<00:03:32.470> sure<00:03:32.829> that<00:03:32.980> throughout<00:03:33.310> the

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
about making sure that throughout the

people<00:04:11.150> go<00:04:11.480> with<00:04:11.630> a<00:04:11.660> gram<00:04:11.930> and<00:04:12.080> a<00:04:12.110> half<00:04:12.320> of

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
people go with a gram and a half of

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.890 
people go with a gram and a half of
protein<00:04:13.850> per<00:04:13.880> pound<00:04:14.060> of<00:04:14.390> body<00:04:14.450> weight<00:04:14.720> and

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
protein per pound of body weight and

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.259 
protein per pound of body weight and
some<00:04:15.200> people<00:04:15.500> think<00:04:15.710> that<00:04:15.830> even<00:04:16.070> gram<00:04:16.430> per

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
some people think that even gram per

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.360 
some people think that even gram per
pound<00:04:17.420> of<00:04:17.540> body<00:04:17.600> weight<00:04:17.810> is<00:04:18.049> overkill<00:04:18.530> so<00:04:19.160> some

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
pound of body weight is overkill so some

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.090 
pound of body weight is overkill so some
people<00:04:19.609> go<00:04:19.730> much<00:04:20.090> less<00:04:20.330> than<00:04:20.540> that<00:04:20.600> I

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100

people go much less than that I
personally<00:04:22.100> always<00:04:22.130> stuck<00:04:22.610> around<00:04:22.760> a<00:04:22.970> gram

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
personally always stuck around a gram

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.260
