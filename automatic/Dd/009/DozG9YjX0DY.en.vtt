so you can actually see where you're

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:32.380 
so you can actually see where you're
going<00:01:30.080> and<00:01:30.350> what<00:01:31.220> the<00:01:31.310> procedures<00:01:31.759> are<00:01:31.970> and<00:01:32.180> as

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
you can see this s ID card chart is very

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.899 
you can see this s ID card chart is very
nice<00:01:35.979> representation<00:01:36.979> of<00:01:37.310> the<00:01:37.460> routes<00:01:37.670> we're

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909

okay<00:01:43.190> so<00:01:43.539> that's<00:01:44.539> symmetry<00:01:45.080> the<00:01:45.470> charts<00:01:45.860> very

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
okay so that's symmetry the charts very

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.539 
okay so that's symmetry the charts very
important<00:01:46.729> then<00:01:47.690> number<00:01:47.930> four<00:01:48.289> try<00:01:49.070> to<00:01:49.190> use<00:01:49.369> as

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
important then number four try to use as

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:51.430 
important then number four try to use as
much<00:01:49.700> possible<00:01:50.149> key<00:01:50.420> assignments<00:01:50.750> as<00:01:51.200> you<00:01:51.289> can

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
much possible key assignments as you can

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.240 
much possible key assignments as you can
see<00:01:51.619> and<00:01:51.799> I've<00:01:51.860> here

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
just display the airport's the data

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.920 
just display the airport's the data
position<00:02:15.709> all<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:17.090> stuff<00:02:17.390> you<00:02:17.540> can<00:02:17.569> basically

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
position all the stuff you can basically

are<00:02:42.980> able<00:02:43.160> to<00:02:43.489> do<00:02:43.609> that<00:02:43.790> right<00:02:43.850> now<00:02:44.180> just<00:02:44.620> makes

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
are able to do that right now just makes

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.949 
are able to do that right now just makes
flying<00:02:45.799> easier<00:02:46.220> you<00:02:46.459> know<00:02:46.609> right<00:02:47.600> now<00:02:47.750> I<00:02:47.780> don't

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
flying easier you know right now I don't

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.039 
flying easier you know right now I don't
have<00:02:48.170> to<00:02:48.350> use<00:02:48.440> my<00:02:48.620> mouse<00:02:48.799> anymore<00:02:49.340> during<00:02:50.049> the

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:51.049 
have to use my mouse anymore during the

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:52.810 
have to use my mouse anymore during the
parching<00:02:51.500> approach<00:02:51.890> the<00:02:52.220> only<00:02:52.430> thing<00:02:52.670> I've

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
parching approach the only thing I've

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.150 
parching approach the only thing I've
used<00:02:53.120> my<00:02:53.269> mouse<00:02:53.450> for<00:02:53.750> is<00:02:53.900> for<00:02:54.200> radio<00:02:54.500> tuning<00:02:54.920> so

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
used my mouse for is for radio tuning so

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.470 
used my mouse for is for radio tuning so
but<00:02:55.820> that's<00:02:55.970> okay<00:02:56.269> now<00:02:56.329> I<00:02:56.570> can<00:02:57.400> basically<00:02:58.480> very

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
but that's okay now I can basically very

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.640 
but that's okay now I can basically very
quickly<00:03:01.090> make<00:03:02.090> sure<00:03:02.299> that<00:03:02.810> the<00:03:02.959> autopilot<00:03:03.320> is

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
quickly make sure that the autopilot is

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.800 
quickly make sure that the autopilot is
fully<00:03:03.890> set<00:03:04.160> and<00:03:04.430> all<00:03:04.820> that<00:03:04.970> kind<00:03:05.239> of<00:03:05.299> stuff<00:03:05.420> so

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
fully set and all that kind of stuff so

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.840 
fully set and all that kind of stuff so
I<00:03:05.840> don't<00:03:06.140> have<00:03:06.230> to<00:03:06.410> mess<00:03:07.340> around<00:03:07.489> with<00:03:07.760> the

make sure you assign keys to joystick as

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.050 
make sure you assign keys to joystick as
well<00:03:20.299> and<00:03:20.540> this<00:03:21.350> key<00:03:21.560> over<00:03:21.739> here<00:03:21.859> I'm<00:03:22.609> using<00:03:22.819> it

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
well and this key over here I'm using it

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.770 
well and this key over here I'm using it
as<00:03:23.209> a<00:03:23.239> push<00:03:23.480> to<00:03:23.600> trophy<00:03:24.019> so<00:03:25.510> it's<00:03:26.510> very<00:03:26.630> easy

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
as a push to trophy so it's very easy

as a push to trophy so it's very easy
while<00:03:27.290> flying<00:03:27.590> around<00:03:28.340> I<00:03:28.639> only<00:03:28.970> have<00:03:29.120> to<00:03:29.239> push

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:29.419 
while flying around I only have to push

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:30.759 
while flying around I only have to push
this<00:03:29.570> key<00:03:29.810> and<00:03:29.959> I'm<00:03:30.079> transmitting<00:03:30.410> on<00:03:30.739> a
