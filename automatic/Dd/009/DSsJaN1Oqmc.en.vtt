00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:24.689
 this time you will have flight here in 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:26.400
 modeling or how I said the videos 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.380
 previous were missing some 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.449
 things to ride the fighter author and 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:35.550
 these things were pretty hot glue 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:37.800
 velcro sticker and s1 they were not so 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.080
 propellers I bought on the local history wheel 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.780
 where the one who had a June knife the only one 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:45.210
 posting being verified of size 10 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.760
 by 41 points in perfect for three 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.980
 times is the most in need of Chinese and 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.350
 like Chinese so we always have 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.880
 have a look at her balancing 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.800
 And this one here is well balanced favelas 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.810
 It's very simple you see the side that she 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.450
 It was so hard, so we'll go. 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.909
 have to add weight to this side here 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.579
 but I bought more than 1s we'll see if 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.020
 all have the same side is of 

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:12.630
 balanced as if it were a 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:19.759
 chronic health problem being more 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:19.759
 one on the side because it generates another 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:31.750
 who also saw the vice private is not only 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:34.569
 lot f was killed and another one is a problem 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.100
 chronicle of the Sistani series is not a 

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:38.020
 Good problem, because it's easy. 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.549
 balance but it's something that people 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.869
 roaming companies do not know that it is 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:43.810
 Need to do this 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.579
 universe a piece of tape can be 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.310
 any kind of tape even I'm going to use 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:49.959
 this one is Flemish tosa any 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.590
 that you have in your house will serve 

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:55.750
 always put in front of the area is a 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.159
 where she's going to turn we'll see if 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.520
 this tape size will suffice 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:06.159
 perfect 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:07.689
 lack standing here is this method and we 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.579
 enter the screwdriver 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:12.430
 is not the most appropriate because it is not so 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:14.380
 I need it but he already attacked you cat 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.579
 will realize that it seems when she will come 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.450
 will not demonstrate any of the 

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:18.450
 releases 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.950
 You were also my stupid finger. 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.570
 then you to you but the little airplane 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.030
 along with this cap and I put 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.580
 just over here it was with the pre 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.000
 but we did not get the first one with 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.000
 velcro 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.650
 surely this will not faithful in 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:53.810
 methods that many of you do not approve 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.330
 but these methods do not only say in the 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.000
 of the airplane in its functional part. 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.700
 there is no gambiarra so I can say 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.200
 that left is so well mounted only remains 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.200
 to know if it will fly 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:40.030
 the wind was strong for good luck joah 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:44.949
 He's going now I do not know what the 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:47.470
 landing and the plane can get off the ground 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:51.940
 needing only a little bit of 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:54.250
 track to be able to take off without hitting the hit 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:57.120
 of the radio I tried to make a hit and he 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:57.120
 did very well 

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:12.370
 so I made a pen for the procon mobile 

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:14.530
 will behave in that moment the chic 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:17.710
 of the accelerator was about 40% 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:19.150
 that's a lot with the plane was also 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.090
 sent a little of the plane while 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:24.039
 smoked 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.419
 now the champion just to know if 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:28.600
 it could do a bit of precision 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:30.400
 in those lines of climb know but there I saw 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.510
 that he did not behave well 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.510
 weak for this 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:46.460
 people right now I 'm already very 

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:48.229
 happy all the time next year was a year 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:50.419
 better than I expected 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:52.939
 It's just that it was not just for flying that 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:55.069
 built with the father himself in 

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:57.430
 say try doing acrobatics and you have to 

00:05:55.069 --> 00:05:57.430
 to be good 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:09.020
 then hit the key and started to 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.020
 try to make a maneuver 

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:31.309
 now I was happy with this plane 

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:31.309
 did everything he should do 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:45.410
 so I almost wanted to run - runway 

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:45.410
 possible 

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:54.099
 Well, I decided to leave this bull like this. 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.500
 winding down here because the wind is 

00:06:54.099 --> 00:06:58.090
 tense because the fear of breaking the plane 

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:00.729
 I want good but with him. 

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:02.819
 This time I did not break anything in that 

00:07:00.729 --> 00:07:02.819
 episode
