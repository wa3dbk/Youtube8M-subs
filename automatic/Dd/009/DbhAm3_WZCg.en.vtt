00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:05.770
 Welcome to your girlfriend and volunteers 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.320
 when our library is home 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.190
 we have 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.259
 all songs labels 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:15.309
 with its cover 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.919
 we complement by creating different playlists 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:21.960
 observation 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.039
 different playlists 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.979
 where we organize the music either by a group of Chilean senators efe 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:35.969
 it may be the case that we wait for these files with which to be 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.460
 convenient to have a backup of our library 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.790
 sane 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.910
 failing eye 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.350
 use kanasin to make a drink 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.449
 I do not know if it happened to you but it may be that it is frequent 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:54.150
 that by mistake 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.720
 we have a playlist 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.720
 let's eliminate something and eliminate 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.320
 that playlist 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.620
 With which 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.740
 bris who has disappeared 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.880
 tie we have a problem because because percent does not 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.250
 we have the fact disappear the music can be found perfectly our 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.920
 library 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.780
 from a playlist 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.300
 with that organized music 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.970
 they have disappeared 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.430
 If we have everything organized, we could always analyze it again 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.700
 that we know what we had 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.390
 if we do not want to lose in time we want to recover it easily if 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.380
 we have a copy of your image 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.310
 we can use this to recover 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.310
 the library file of the library 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.810
 get everything back to its place 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.250
 for this the first thing we should do is 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:50.150
 serra 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:51.540
 there all 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.320
 agreement 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.820
 the closed application 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.680
 we go 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.680
 tired machin 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.920
 we go to our user folder 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.560
 we go to the music folder that sounds 

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:14.299
 is our library if we had changed it by shaking bush 

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:18.869
 where the tablets are 

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:23.249
 enter central music here we have our library 

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:27.979
 we access 

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:29.309
 and here we have 

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:30.239
 the file that 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.529
 let's recover according to this case 

00:02:33.529 --> 00:02:35.389
 haiti is free 

00:02:35.389 --> 00:02:38.579
 we can select what 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:41.579
 and we're going to be banks that their last modification 

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:44.759
 in agreement 

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:47.759
 at 10 and 56 we are 

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:51.879
 we go like this unlike the goat i 

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:55.269
 or we can move by the way of time driving any of the 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:56.319
 10 cents 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.109
 in agreement 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:00.379
 or we can 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:02.999
 modern also 

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:04.609
 the arrows 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:05.899
 appear 

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:08.399
 between magín to go 

00:03:08.399 --> 00:03:12.469
 to the version that interests us the most advisable is to go to a 

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:15.419
 Same-day injury agreement 

00:03:15.419 --> 00:03:17.669
 for example 

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:19.909
 today at 9 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:22.539
 today at 4 in the morning 

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:25.539
 we can stand up well to the version that interests us most 

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:28.269
 I remember 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.609
 today we have at 7 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:35.930
 we had made some modifications today at 9 55 before the modification of 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.260
 according to pigs changed something in the library so that this 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:40.699
 do not be affected 

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:43.579
 we select the file 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:45.779
 and we click on the button 

00:03:45.779 --> 00:03:49.069
 restore 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:50.979
 automatically 

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:53.319
 the file 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.409
 will replace us if we want to run original 

00:03:58.059 --> 00:04:00.619
 we go over 

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:03.619
 and we can return April 

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:08.709
 open to inputs 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.129
 our library 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:13.619
 and if we go 

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:17.120
 to that resolution here is the resolution list 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.850
 that we had lost the lanús party 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:25.680
 left agreement with what you see that simple gil a small country 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.660
 level your backup and restore the version that we most 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:31.210
 interest 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.139
 if we have made changes remember to use 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:38.800
 an injury in a former hairdresser of the prosperous day could choose between 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.789
 different
