00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.380
 hello here is python thank you 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.910
 be back here now there is the 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.620
 next online fight and we already 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.390
 can see it this time no came from 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.090
 me but from my very good friend 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.500
 nw luxair also has a chance search 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.360
 fought and found someone who 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.040
 really just fought with new pokémon 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.750
 has from the sixth generation 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.989
 and this fight is really one 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:32.000
 example of the double fight xy 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:35.059
 can run more defensively and 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.670
 not just a pure exchange 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.320
 As you can see, the enemy must catch up 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.019
 garth jürgen and rock era to 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.320
 Of course that is already one 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:47.300
 defensive song lux has had at the beginning 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.949
 exchanged hate because of the types 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.140
 Effect really not the best position 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:52.670
 had sparkles on the spot it brings 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.850
 here the thunder wave first through 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:58.100
 Bots King's shield is only paralyzed 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.280
 and pigs are brought out for 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:05.420
 kara you can see nothing interesting 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.670
 Too often in double combat toxin comes 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.409
 and thanks to spotlight we are on tour 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.380
 it would probably like to 12 too 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:13.909
 i have appreciated the windows 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.680
 Fist was enough to over half 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:19.520
 to make harm both ears gave that 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.619
 is called a toolkit ko that would be with 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.240
 dark fist, however, bears gates 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:27.860
 also remains why a simple king 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.710
 sign here again sufficiently around the 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.869
 to get out of the way 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.969
 tobias just kept on banding and spotlighting 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.619
 lynx has king sign with the 

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:39.860
 probably foreseen and does 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.570
 therefore the mistake on rocca rastatt 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.000
 to attack again through the garden 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:47.030
 and yes we have seen the bizarre room 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.950
 got out of rock this is now 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.670
 Of course for the opponent completely 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.189
 orderly 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.899
 a paralyzed tier guard also had 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:55.340
 Of course, there is always something then 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:57.649
 should attack first 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.020
 which is also here after the spotlight and 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:02.180
 the opportunity continues to benefit 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.630
 to know with sword dance now comes 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.939
 however another one more 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.890
 window fist through the almost kate 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:12.560
 but thank you remnants it could 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.360
 Surviving toxin will awake from worry 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.260
 Chris just fended off because it already 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.840
 poisoned 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.959
 and as it continues to make spotlight 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.410
 Toxin can not be absorbed either 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:26.180
 The opponent has now tried 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.800
 attack and not the kingsfeld 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:32.690
 However, it was sacrifice 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.370
 become paralysis and could 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.410
 nevertheless not attack 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.170
 lux took advantage of the opportunity 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:42.560
 pizarro room again off here 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.160
 However, as we will not see 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.989
 Long 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.610
 It's the trophy here 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.540
 Indulged again with a bit of coffee 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.610
 fill 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.040
 it just protects you now 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.290
 was re-sign with the king with 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:59.349
 no more attacking the pc first 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:02.540
 Space is indeed at this point attacks 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:05.629
 but also because of local change because 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:08.030
 lux probably looks with the king 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:12.140
 has reckoned thanks to red card 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.790
 We are also exchanged and we already 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.180
 half announced comes now here in the 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:19.430
 room again by the enemy then kroker 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.209
 and looking there has at least one again 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.980
 few café collected so and clock harbor 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.650
 Of course, this must first happen 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:33.450
 Let's worry because it's here last 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:38.489
 attacking may, however, rescued cris 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:41.190
 pretty much everyone out of everyone 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:43.680
 situation with the spotlight shadow 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.810
 kick came through and foot has become 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.489
 harbor sacrificed so to speak here still stands 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.410
 there and for a draco meteor 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:51.480
 and that's enough 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:55.050
 actually watch and watch here 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:57.090
 field to clear the special attack sinks 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.280
 Of course, however, herring will now turn 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.250
 we activate now and see through it 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:05.190
 the status values ​​are restored 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.750
 so now that's probably what 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.209
 even each one seems to be from the opponent 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.380
 and ohoven would have that here, of course 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.470
 can make problems 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.209
 At this point, Dhabi becomes active in the room 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.150
 is and where to be in his towering 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:20.040
 call pool also has dragon pulse because of that 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:23.580
 Luxury thought it was easy 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.950
 protected port and with 415 affordable 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:29.070
 deactivated again now he can help 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:31.889
 Pass me the draco meteor enough 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.530
 but not where to look completely 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:35.850
 to defeat that before that one here 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.130
 before that the dragon pulse 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.940
 bring through and thus harbor 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.330
 saying goodbye 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:44.070
 two windows brings here but still 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.720
 window fist so looks was aware 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.300
 that it is not enough for an oneway 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.280
 I estimate coverband meanwhile 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.350
 just keep on running 

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:55.380
 lux still has logo in the backhand 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.760
 and the opponent still bizarre that it for 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:00.120
 Of course, lux first, a good one 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:04.650
 initial situation lux even plays the 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:07.350
 mega stone on logic and it looks 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.660
 Of course not so bad 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:13.470
 for lux in place of the opponent protects 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:15.510
 but first his bidon and begins 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:18.210
 so the mistake of what two 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:20.460
 Fans come from here comes toxin 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:24.180
 by what, but not so much 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:26.870
 A lot should matter in this offensive 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:30.360
 phase that's what I call it 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:32.340
 blog is now launching the dive house 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.950
 shelves which, of course, for the moment 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:37.289
 is not enough focus kurt or similar on 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.430
 start and there I have to go directly 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:40.490
 say goodbye 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.750
 praise gets neat recoil 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.790
 however, the fight is like you now 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.920
 I almost ran 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.360
 rocker still stands with a few kpd and 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.550
 the opponent thought probably one more 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.580
 Round out by again the number 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.380
 Space sets the power, however, too 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.200
 not so many can help it 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:00.740
 even attack 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:03.180
 first intervene and thus cyclists 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:07.290
 Say goodbye and that's the victory 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:09.000
 also to lux yes and that was the fight like 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:10.560
 I thought it was a very good one 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.990
 example that it is not necessarily 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:14.700
 I always have to run aggressively, I hope 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.200
 I liked your fight and that 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:19.550
 I say goodbye already and 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.550
 his tips and see you next time
