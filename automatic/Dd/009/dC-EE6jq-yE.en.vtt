way this was a really short match
started<00:02:05.409> out<00:02:05.530> about<00:02:05.770> seven<00:02:06.460> minutes<00:02:06.640> and<00:02:06.820> 30

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
started out about seven minutes and 30

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.499 
started out about seven minutes and 30
seconds<00:02:07.479> long<00:02:07.689> which<00:02:07.990> is<00:02:08.110> very<00:02:08.440> short<00:02:09.209> in<00:02:10.209> my

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
seconds long which is very short in my

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.009 
seconds long which is very short in my
opinion<00:02:10.980> squad<00:02:11.980> deathmatch<00:02:12.630> rounds<00:02:13.630> usually

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
opinion squad deathmatch rounds usually

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:16.559 
opinion squad deathmatch rounds usually
lasts<00:02:14.319> a<00:02:15.310> shorter<00:02:15.940> period<00:02:15.970> of<00:02:16.330> time<00:02:16.390> than

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
lasts a shorter period of time than

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:19.229 
lasts a shorter period of time than
Russia<00:02:17.050> conquest<00:02:17.620> but<00:02:17.830> still<00:02:18.160> just<00:02:18.400> about

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
Russia conquest but still just about

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.320 
Russia conquest but still just about
every<00:02:19.599> match<00:02:19.780> you<00:02:19.959> play<00:02:20.110> in<00:02:20.290> this<00:02:20.410> game<00:02:21.330> goes

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
every match you play in this game goes

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.520 
every match you play in this game goes
around<00:02:22.709> 10<00:02:23.709> minutes<00:02:24.069> or<00:02:24.370> longer<00:02:25.269> in<00:02:26.200> my

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
around 10 minutes or longer in my

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.050 
around 10 minutes or longer in my
experience<00:02:26.769> so<00:02:27.340> it<00:02:27.430> was<00:02:27.580> kind<00:02:27.760> of<00:02:27.790> a<00:02:27.910> nice

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
experience so it was kind of a nice

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.539 
experience so it was kind of a nice
change<00:02:28.360> of<00:02:28.510> pace<00:02:28.569> to<00:02:29.049> jump<00:02:30.010> into<00:02:30.160> this<00:02:30.310> match

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549

from medal of honor because the knifing
in<00:03:39.639> that<00:03:39.850> game<00:03:40.060> is<00:03:40.299> much<00:03:40.540> better<00:03:40.810> it's<00:03:41.530> not<00:03:41.769> as

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
in that game is much better it's not as

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.160 
in that game is much better it's not as
responsive<00:03:42.130> as<00:03:42.519> it<00:03:42.970> is<00:03:43.090> in<00:03:43.329> call<00:03:43.540> of<00:03:43.569> duty<00:03:43.690> but

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
responsive as it is in call of duty but

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.780 
responsive as it is in call of duty but
it's<00:03:44.350> definitely<00:03:44.650> improvement<00:03:45.430> on<00:03:45.549> the

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
it's definitely improvement on the
