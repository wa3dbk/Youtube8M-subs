00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.549
 between May and poker there are different 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.770
 similarities then according to me the most 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.250
 important of all is that in both 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.060
 games 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.560
 a phenomenal concentration is needed 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.630
 we must not lose even a moment 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.480
 of the match clear the moment when 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.550
 you want to get a kind of game 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.369
 competitive because more information yes 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.080
 they take from every situation the better 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.720
 can manage his own poker game 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.430
 and tributes and that it is another similarity 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.920
 that there are between these two games is 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.160
 the importance of not underestimating any 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.480
 mathematical aspect of the game in magic is 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.270
 fundamental to know mathematics 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.379
 situations like in poker though 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.600
 we don't know an example 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.640
 quite simple that knows if k against 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.570
 22 is a blow where there are equal 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.730
 chance of victory 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.969
 we have difficulty sitting at 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.430
 table then the psychological aspect is more 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.989
 important in poker because you need to 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.610
 understand who is in front of you 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.229
 based on how he is playing that cards 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.820
 poor in hand the same thing also i 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.490
 magic from how our opponent 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.890
 leads the game we can understand 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.180
 what cards in hand and so what 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.220
 it will also happen later 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.360
 I believe that one of the reasons why i 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.350
 players switch from magic to poker is the 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.740
 competitiveness that exists within the 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.070
 game 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.600
 because I remember magic when you do 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.400
 played a game 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.470
 the goal was to never give up too 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.009
 when the situation gets tough 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.310
 and this we say is also in poker too 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.009
 if we have very few chips we say 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.409
 in a tournament with a chip leader at 30 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:45.110
 Sometimes we know that the game can 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.850
 change can change from a moment 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.259
 to the other because it is enough to win two three 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.030
 shots in a row and get back in 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.340
 roadway now fail to 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.840
 return to goods because I have 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.869
 completely in love with the game of 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.759
 poker and it's difficult to manage yours 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.890
 passions at the same time with the 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:02.689
 maximum concentration now not 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.220
 I could go back to the media because 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:07.909
 the excitement of poker 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.560
 I know no magic has given me are 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:13.540
 in love with this game and no not 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.540
 I would spend a few from the machine
