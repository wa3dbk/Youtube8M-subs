00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
acted as a catalyst to seemingly growing

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.360 
acted as a catalyst to seemingly growing
separation<00:03:37.079> between<00:03:37.200> you<00:03:37.530> and<00:03:37.680> the<00:03:37.739> other<00:03:37.889> PKA

hosts<00:03:38.700> I'm<00:03:39.510> going<00:03:39.750> to<00:03:39.810> go<00:03:39.870> in<00:03:39.989> to<00:03:40.019> find<00:03:40.319> the

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
hosts I'm going to go in to find the

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.809 
hosts I'm going to go in to find the
word<00:03:40.560> catalyst<00:03:40.950> because<00:03:41.040> I<00:03:41.250> had<00:03:41.430> to<00:03:41.519> look<00:03:41.670> it

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
word catalyst because I had to look it

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:43.430 
word catalyst because I had to look it
up<00:03:41.940> and<00:03:42.120> actually<00:03:42.269> what<00:03:42.600> it<00:03:42.690> means<00:03:42.900> catalyst

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
up and actually what it means catalyst

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.780 
up and actually what it means catalyst
is<00:03:43.650> a<00:03:43.950> source<00:03:44.340> of<00:03:45.560> whatever<00:03:46.560> materials<00:03:47.400> that

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
is a source of whatever materials that

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.199 
is a source of whatever materials that
can<00:03:48.000> act<00:03:48.239> as<00:03:48.389> fuel<00:03:48.810> to<00:03:49.680> burn<00:03:50.400> without<00:03:50.790> changing

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
can act as fuel to burn without changing

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.809 
can act as fuel to burn without changing
itself<00:03:51.540> so<00:03:52.160> essentially<00:03:53.160> is<00:03:53.340> white<00:03:53.579> white

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
itself so essentially is white white

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:55.430 
itself so essentially is white white

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
separates women between me and the host

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.720 
separates women between me and the host
I<00:03:57.739> would<00:03:58.739> like<00:03:58.889> to<00:03:59.010> think<00:03:59.190> that<00:03:59.430> me<00:03:59.579> and<00:03:59.639> the

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
I would like to think that me and the

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.479 
I would like to think that me and the
host<00:03:59.940> aren't<00:04:00.510> separating<00:04:01.290> I<00:04:01.500> think<00:04:01.889> what<00:04:02.430> I

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
host aren't separating I think what I

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.099 
host aren't separating I think what I
want<00:04:02.670> to<00:04:02.760> do<00:04:02.849> is<00:04:02.970> like<00:04:03.120> we<00:04:03.150> kind<00:04:03.510> of<00:04:03.630> stepped

want to do is like we kind of stepped

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:05.960 
want to do is like we kind of stepped
