00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:16.049
 these are the files that you may need 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:20.150
 when it comes to working with gel in the first 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.490
 place you need a 100 grain file 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:26.660
 the grain has to do with roughness 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:28.849
 of the lime to a lesser degree means that 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.890
 is more aggressive therefore in this 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.739
 case the 100 grain is the one 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.260
 we will use to reduce the thickness of 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:39.199
 gel at the time of making for example 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:42.350
 well a filling and it's also pretty 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:46.070
 useful for shaping the gel nail 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:49.070
 then maybe you need the lime 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:52.670
 whose grain is 150 is a little less 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:55.190
 aggressive therefore it is used in the area 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.559
 of the cuticle because there is less 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.170
 of gel and a more aggressive lime could 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:03.859
 damage the natural nail 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:06.260
 also serves to polish as last 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:09.710
 I review the gel nail 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:13.160
 then finally there is the grain file 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.200
 180 is much finer and in the gel it 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.100
 used to polish the surface 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.440
 eliminate roughness some irregularity 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.890
 of the gel surface 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:28.400
 then the lime taco file is once 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.500
 you see smoothed surface of the gel 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.930
 I will use jce to eliminate scratches 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.230
 that have remained of any of these 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:39.080
 files and leaves it is finer in this way 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:44.340
 is ready to apply the brightness is 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:47.009
 of grain 220 280 approximately 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.810
 I have put a file of each form but 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.469
 The only thing you have to take into account 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:57.929
 is that the big balloon is different 

00:01:52.469 --> 00:02:02.340
 I remember grain 100 grain 150 grain 180 and 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:04.319
 then the one that is to polish 220 280 and 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.929
 then if you want to do a lot of work 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:09.239
 faster is the lathe 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:11.810
 has lime refills and you can also 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:17.510
 you can find it in different 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:20.030
 beads 180 150 or 100 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.860
