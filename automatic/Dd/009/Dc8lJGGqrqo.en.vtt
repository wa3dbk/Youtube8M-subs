environment for the first example we're

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:33.490 
environment for the first example we're
going<00:00:31.669> to<00:00:31.730> graph<00:00:32.090> the<00:00:32.329> input<00:00:32.660> output<00:00:32.780> nodes<00:00:33.260> of

editor notice that the nodes as well as

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:39.760 
editor notice that the nodes as well as
their<00:00:38.149> connections<00:00:38.600> are<00:00:38.750> color-coded<00:00:39.350> giving

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
their connections are color-coded giving

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.170 
their connections are color-coded giving
you<00:00:39.829> a<00:00:39.890> visual<00:00:40.219> representation<00:00:40.579> as<00:00:40.969> to<00:00:41.000> the

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
you a visual representation as to the

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.549 
you a visual representation as to the
type<00:00:41.390> of<00:00:41.420> data<00:00:41.690> that<00:00:41.899> you're<00:00:42.020> working<00:00:42.230> with

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
type of data that you're working with

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:45.069 
type of data that you're working with
the<00:00:43.309> node<00:00:43.520> names<00:00:43.790> appear<00:00:44.149> above<00:00:44.359> the<00:00:44.510> nodes<00:00:44.719> so

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 
the node names appear above the nodes so

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:46.329 
the node names appear above the nodes so
that<00:00:45.230> even<00:00:45.379> when<00:00:45.559> you<00:00:45.649> compress<00:00:45.980> the<00:00:46.129> nodes

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:46.339 
that even when you compress the nodes

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:48.250 
that even when you compress the nodes
down<00:00:46.489> to<00:00:46.640> a<00:00:46.670> very<00:00:46.850> small<00:00:47.000> view<00:00:47.570> they're<00:00:48.019> still

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
down to a very small view they're still

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.529 
down to a very small view they're still
easily<00:00:48.649> readable<00:00:48.999> when<00:00:49.999> working<00:00:50.179> with<00:00:50.420> the

00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:50.539 
easily readable when working with the

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:52.299 
easily readable when working with the
node<00:00:50.719> names<00:00:50.989> we<00:00:51.199> can<00:00:51.350> use<00:00:51.469> a<00:00:51.499> hotkey<00:00:51.829> to<00:00:52.129> switch

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
node names we can use a hotkey to switch

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.009 
node names we can use a hotkey to switch
between<00:00:52.460> different<00:00:52.670> display<00:00:53.300> types<00:00:53.570> right

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:54.019 
between different display types right

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:56.020 
between different display types right
now<00:00:54.199> we're<00:00:54.440> currently<00:00:54.620> showing<00:00:55.280> the<00:00:55.789> node

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
now we're currently showing the node

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.970 
now we're currently showing the node
name<00:00:56.329> if<00:00:56.600> I<00:00:56.690> hit<00:00:56.839> the<00:00:56.929> hotkey<00:00:57.289> v<00:00:57.620> I've

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
name if I hit the hotkey v I've

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.430 
name if I hit the hotkey v I've
displayed<00:00:58.519> the<00:00:58.850> type<00:00:59.089> of<00:00:59.269> node<00:00:59.480> if<00:00:59.719> I<00:01:00.050> hit<00:01:00.170> v

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
displayed the type of node if I hit v

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.419 
displayed the type of node if I hit v
one<00:01:00.710> more<00:01:00.949> time

00:01:01.419 --> 00:01:01.429 
one more time

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:03.430 
one more time
I<00:01:01.460> basically<00:01:01.850> hide<00:01:02.420> all<00:01:02.719> the<00:01:02.899> naming<00:01:03.230> and<00:01:03.379> I'm

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440 
I basically hide all the naming and I'm

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.140 
I basically hide all the naming and I'm
left<00:01:03.589> with<00:01:03.679> just<00:01:03.800> a<00:01:04.040> visual<00:01:04.400> flow<00:01:04.640> of<00:01:04.909> the

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
left with just a visual flow of the

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.140 
left with just a visual flow of the
dependency<00:01:05.659> graph<00:01:05.690> inside<00:01:06.290> of<00:01:06.380> our<00:01:06.500> node<00:01:07.150> so

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
dependency graph inside of our node so

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.250 
dependency graph inside of our node so
the<00:01:08.240> next<00:01:08.480> thing<00:01:08.600> that<00:01:08.630> we<00:01:08.750> want<00:01:08.930> to<00:01:08.960> do<00:01:09.110> is

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
the next thing that we want to do is

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.690 
the next thing that we want to do is
look<00:01:09.380> at<00:01:09.470> how<00:01:09.620> we<00:01:09.680> can<00:01:09.860> use<00:01:10.070> the<00:01:10.220> node<00:01:10.430> editor

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
look at how we can use the node editor

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.670 
look at how we can use the node editor
to<00:01:11.060> generate<00:01:11.420> shaders<00:01:11.870> I'll<00:01:12.350> go<00:01:12.440> ahead<00:01:12.530> and

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
to generate shaders I'll go ahead and

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.780 
to generate shaders I'll go ahead and
I'll<00:01:12.740> pick<00:01:12.860> a<00:01:12.890> piece<00:01:13.100> of<00:01:13.220> geometry<00:01:13.430> that<00:01:13.670> I

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
I'll pick a piece of geometry that I

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:15.370 
I'll pick a piece of geometry that I
want<00:01:13.970> to<00:01:14.030> begin<00:01:14.210> working<00:01:14.420> with<00:01:14.600> and<00:01:14.990> just<00:01:15.229> use

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
want to begin working with and just use

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.350 
want to begin working with and just use
our<00:01:15.500> marker<00:01:15.800> menu<00:01:16.040> to<00:01:16.220> graph<00:01:16.520> that<00:01:16.790> material

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
our marker menu to graph that material

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.180 
our marker menu to graph that material
so<00:01:18.050> you<00:01:18.110> can<00:01:18.200> see<00:01:18.410> here<00:01:18.560> that<00:01:18.650> we<00:01:18.770> have<00:01:18.800> a

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.190 
so you can see here that we have a

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.280 
so you can see here that we have a
simple<00:01:19.550> blend<00:01:19.820> material<00:01:19.910> and<00:01:20.420> a<00:01:20.750> shader<00:01:21.020> group

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
simple blend material and a shader group

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.470 
simple blend material and a shader group
associated<00:01:21.920> with<00:01:22.010> it<00:01:22.190> so<00:01:22.790> I<00:01:22.820> know<00:01:22.940> that<00:01:23.240> I<00:01:23.270> want

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:23.480 
associated with it so I know that I want

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.730 
associated with it so I know that I want
to<00:01:23.570> have<00:01:23.750> a<00:01:23.780> diffuse<00:01:24.290> channel<00:01:24.650> on<00:01:24.710> a

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
to have a diffuse channel on a

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.620 
to have a diffuse channel on a
reflection<00:01:25.190> channel<00:01:25.490> piped<00:01:25.910> into<00:01:26.360> this<00:01:26.450> piece

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
reflection channel piped into this piece

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.030 
reflection channel piped into this piece
of<00:01:26.780> geometry<00:01:27.020> so<00:01:27.380> what<00:01:27.500> we're<00:01:27.620> going<00:01:27.710> to<00:01:27.770> do<00:01:27.920> is

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
of geometry so what we're going to do is

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.100 
of geometry so what we're going to do is
we're<00:01:28.130> going<00:01:28.220> to<00:01:28.280> go<00:01:28.400> ahead<00:01:28.520> and<00:01:28.940> just<00:01:29.750> drag

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
we're going to go ahead and just drag

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.110 
we're going to go ahead and just drag
those<00:01:30.350> guys<00:01:30.560> down<00:01:30.860> into<00:01:31.400> into<00:01:31.850> our<00:01:31.970> node

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.120 
those guys down into into our node

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.790 
those guys down into into our node
editor<00:01:32.360> so<00:01:32.540> we'll<00:01:32.660> grab<00:01:32.870> this<00:01:33.110> kind<00:01:33.740> of

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
editor so we'll grab this kind of

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.640 
editor so we'll grab this kind of
reflection<00:01:34.220> ball<00:01:34.580> and<00:01:35.260> we'll<00:01:36.260> grab<00:01:36.470> this

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:36.650 
reflection ball and we'll grab this

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.070 
reflection ball and we'll grab this
diffuse<00:01:37.160> we'll<00:01:37.490> put<00:01:37.670> that<00:01:37.820> guy<00:01:38.000> over<00:01:38.330> here<00:01:38.660> and

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
diffuse we'll put that guy over here and

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.660 
diffuse we'll put that guy over here and
kind<00:01:39.260> of<00:01:39.350> snap<00:01:39.770> those<00:01:40.010> guys<00:01:40.190> to<00:01:40.370> the<00:01:40.490> grid

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
kind of snap those guys to the grid

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.880 
kind of snap those guys to the grid
really<00:01:40.940> quickly<00:01:41.270> so<00:01:42.020> right<00:01:42.260> now<00:01:42.440> we're

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
really quickly so right now we're

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.290 
really quickly so right now we're
looking<00:01:43.040> at<00:01:43.250> the<00:01:43.370> nodes<00:01:43.610> in<00:01:43.910> their<00:01:44.120> most

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
looking at the nodes in their most

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.000 
looking at the nodes in their most
compressed<00:01:44.690> view<00:01:45.110> when<00:01:45.380> working<00:01:45.590> in<00:01:45.800> the<00:01:45.860> node

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.010 
compressed view when working in the node

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:47.920 
compressed view when working in the node
editor<00:01:46.130> we<00:01:46.430> can<00:01:46.460> always<00:01:46.910> display<00:01:47.330> the<00:01:47.360> node<00:01:47.690> in

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
editor we can always display the node in

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.990 
editor we can always display the node in
multiple<00:01:48.470> different<00:01:48.680> levels<00:01:48.980> giving<00:01:49.910> you

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
multiple different levels giving you

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.330 
multiple different levels giving you
more<00:01:50.240> or<00:01:50.450> less<00:01:50.630> information<00:01:51.320> this<00:01:52.010> can<00:01:52.220> be

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
more or less information this can be

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.250 
more or less information this can be
done<00:01:52.490> either<00:01:52.640> with<00:01:52.820> hotkeys<00:01:53.360> or<00:01:53.630> by<00:01:53.930> using<00:01:54.110> the

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
done either with hotkeys or by using the

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.530 
done either with hotkeys or by using the
toggle<00:01:54.680> switches<00:01:54.890> on<00:01:55.130> top<00:01:55.280> of<00:01:55.430> the<00:01:55.490> toolbar<00:01:55.730> so

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
toggle switches on top of the toolbar so

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:57.340 
toggle switches on top of the toolbar so
what<00:01:56.660> we're<00:01:56.780> going<00:01:56.870> to<00:01:56.930> do<00:01:57.020> is<00:01:57.110> we're<00:01:57.200> going<00:01:57.290> to

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.810 
what we're going to do is we're going to
take<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:57.770> muffler<00:01:58.190> and<00:01:58.220> the<00:01:58.400> shading<00:01:58.790> group

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
take the muffler and the shading group

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.430 
take the muffler and the shading group
and<00:01:59.450> we're<00:01:59.570> going<00:01:59.720> to<00:01:59.750> switch<00:01:59.990> their<00:02:00.230> node

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
and we're going to switch their node

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.650 
and we're going to switch their node
view<00:02:00.920> from<00:02:01.160> being<00:02:01.370> the<00:02:01.490> compressed<00:02:01.910> view<00:02:02.180> to

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660

obviously<00:02:19.459> we<00:02:19.610> don't<00:02:19.700> really<00:02:19.999> want<00:02:20.150> to<00:02:20.209> see

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:20.359 
obviously we don't really want to see

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:21.910 
obviously we don't really want to see
all<00:02:20.510> that<00:02:20.540> information<00:02:21.079> so<00:02:21.109> we'll<00:02:21.319> go<00:02:21.409> back<00:02:21.439> to

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
all that information so we'll go back to

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.459 
all that information so we'll go back to
our<00:02:22.040> compressed<00:02:22.489> view<00:02:23.109> let's<00:02:24.109> go<00:02:24.230> ahead<00:02:24.290> and

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:24.469 
our compressed view let's go ahead and

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:25.580 
our compressed view let's go ahead and
increase<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:24.859> size<00:02:25.069> of<00:02:25.219> this

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
increase the size of this

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.960 
increase the size of this
shader'<00:02:25.769> ball<00:02:26.040> too<00:02:26.190> so<00:02:26.340> it's<00:02:26.430> a<00:02:26.489> little<00:02:26.700> easier

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
shader' ball too so it's a little easier

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.150 
shader' ball too so it's a little easier
to<00:02:27.030> see<00:02:27.150> what's<00:02:27.390> going<00:02:27.540> on<00:02:27.720> with<00:02:27.870> that<00:02:27.989> guy<00:02:28.200> so

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
to see what's going on with that guy so

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.140 
to see what's going on with that guy so
the<00:02:29.340> next<00:02:29.519> thing<00:02:29.700> we're<00:02:29.790> going<00:02:29.910> to<00:02:29.970> talk<00:02:30.120> about

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
the next thing we're going to talk about

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.820 
the next thing we're going to talk about
is<00:02:30.480> how<00:02:30.599> we<00:02:30.660> can<00:02:30.870> make<00:02:31.019> connections<00:02:31.379> between

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
is how we can make connections between

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.410 
is how we can make connections between
the<00:02:32.160> different<00:02:32.190> nodes<00:02:32.670> we<00:02:33.000> can<00:02:33.030> either<00:02:33.300> do

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
the different nodes we can either do

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.119 
the different nodes we can either do
this<00:02:33.510> in<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.750> compress<00:02:34.140> view<00:02:34.470> or<00:02:34.650> the

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
this in the compress view or the

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:36.830 
this in the compress view or the
expanded<00:02:35.700> view<00:02:35.819> and<00:02:36.030> the<00:02:36.090> workflow<00:02:36.450> is<00:02:36.510> very

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
expanded view and the workflow is very

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.960 
expanded view and the workflow is very
similar<00:02:37.110> for<00:02:37.260> both<00:02:37.440> all<00:02:38.160> you<00:02:38.519> have<00:02:38.640> to<00:02:38.730> do<00:02:38.819> is

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
similar for both all you have to do is

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.490 
similar for both all you have to do is
go<00:02:39.090> and<00:02:39.239> click<00:02:39.450> on<00:02:39.629> the<00:02:39.750> output<00:02:39.900> side<00:02:40.319> of<00:02:40.440> a

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
go and click on the output side of a

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.530 
go and click on the output side of a
given<00:02:40.800> node<00:02:40.980> select<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:41.879> attribute<00:02:42.030> that<00:02:42.480> you

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
given node select the attribute that you

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.000 
given node select the attribute that you
want<00:02:42.690> to<00:02:42.780> get<00:02:42.840> so<00:02:43.260> in<00:02:43.379> this<00:02:43.470> step<00:02:43.799> but<00:02:43.890> we'll

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
want to get so in this step but we'll

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.800 
want to get so in this step but we'll
get<00:02:44.099> out<00:02:44.340> color<00:02:44.640> and<00:02:45.120> then<00:02:45.239> go<00:02:45.330> to<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.510> input

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
get out color and then go to the input

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.089 
get out color and then go to the input
side<00:02:46.019> of<00:02:46.049> the<00:02:46.170> node<00:02:46.379> you<00:02:46.530> want<00:02:46.709> to<00:02:46.769> pipe<00:02:46.950> it

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
side of the node you want to pipe it

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:48.890 
side of the node you want to pipe it
information<00:02:47.580> into<00:02:47.849> again<00:02:48.450> we'll<00:02:48.599> just<00:02:48.629> shove

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
information into again we'll just shove

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.110 
information into again we'll just shove
it<00:02:49.019> into<00:02:49.140> color<00:02:49.519> so<00:02:50.519> that's<00:02:50.700> that's<00:02:50.910> basically

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
it into color so that's that's basically

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.880 
it into color so that's that's basically
one<00:02:51.690> way<00:02:51.720> of<00:02:51.989> working<00:02:52.170> with<00:02:52.379> the<00:02:52.500> compressed

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
one way of working with the compressed

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.949 
one way of working with the compressed
nodes<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:54.120> next<00:02:54.390> view<00:02:54.599> that<00:02:54.690> we're<00:02:54.810> going<00:02:54.900> to

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
nodes the next view that we're going to

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.259 
nodes the next view that we're going to
look<00:02:55.110> at<00:02:55.290> is<00:02:55.530> let's<00:02:56.220> expand<00:02:56.610> these<00:02:56.790> guys<00:02:57.000> out

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
look at is let's expand these guys out

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.509 
look at is let's expand these guys out
to<00:02:57.540> show<00:02:57.690> all<00:02:57.930> the<00:02:58.140> lists<00:02:58.560> here<00:02:58.739> is<00:02:58.890> how<00:02:59.370> we<00:02:59.430> can

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
to show all the lists here is how we can

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.190 
to show all the lists here is how we can
make<00:02:59.790> connections<00:03:00.060> in<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.569> more<00:03:00.750> expanded

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
make connections in the more expanded

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.430 
make connections in the more expanded
view<00:03:01.530> so<00:03:01.709> let's<00:03:01.739> go<00:03:01.920> ahead<00:03:01.980> and<00:03:02.069> delete<00:03:02.250> that

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
view so let's go ahead and delete that

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.180 
view so let's go ahead and delete that
what<00:03:04.440> we're<00:03:04.560> gonna<00:03:04.620> do<00:03:04.799> now<00:03:04.920> is<00:03:04.950> we're<00:03:05.069> gonna

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
what we're gonna do now is we're gonna

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:06.589 
what we're gonna do now is we're gonna
grab<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.459> out<00:03:05.700> color<00:03:06.000> and<00:03:06.209> again<00:03:06.269> we're<00:03:06.540> gonna

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
grab the out color and again we're gonna

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.210 
grab the out color and again we're gonna
pipe<00:03:06.810> it<00:03:06.989> to<00:03:07.019> in<00:03:07.230> color<00:03:07.530> but<00:03:07.739> I<00:03:07.769> want<00:03:08.010> you<00:03:08.099> to

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
pipe it to in color but I want you to

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.420 
pipe it to in color but I want you to
notice<00:03:08.519> what<00:03:08.849> happens<00:03:09.209> when<00:03:09.360> I<00:03:09.390> get<00:03:09.480> this<00:03:09.780> note

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
notice what happens when I get this note

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.190 
notice what happens when I get this note
close<00:03:11.430> to<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:12.000> input<00:03:12.360> side<00:03:12.540> of<00:03:12.599> the<00:03:12.930> muffler

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.319 
close to the input side of the muffler
it<00:03:13.769> goes<00:03:14.010> ahead<00:03:14.190> and<00:03:14.370> it<00:03:14.430> Gray's<00:03:14.879> out<00:03:15.120> the

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
it goes ahead and it Gray's out the

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.059 
it goes ahead and it Gray's out the

type can't go in - it's a vector file or
data<00:03:20.010> type<00:03:20.220> so<00:03:20.340> it's<00:03:20.459> got<00:03:20.610> XY<00:03:21.329> names<00:03:21.510> the

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
data type so it's got XY names the

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 
information or RGB the information so it

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:25.789

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
close to incandescent it'll try to snap

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
to it or if I get close to color it'll

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.920 
to it or if I get close to color it'll
try<00:03:29.519> to<00:03:29.579> snap<00:03:29.880> to<00:03:30.090> it<00:03:30.209> to<00:03:30.510> make<00:03:30.750> that

try to snap to it to make that

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.930 
try to snap to it to make that
connection<00:03:31.400> another<00:03:32.400> thing<00:03:32.579> that's<00:03:32.639> kind<00:03:32.819> of

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
connection another thing that's kind of

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.580 
connection another thing that's kind of
nice<00:03:33.090> about<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.480> node<00:03:33.600> editor<00:03:33.900> is<00:03:33.989> if<00:03:34.139> you

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
nice about the node editor is if you

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.830 
nice about the node editor is if you
have<00:03:34.739> a<00:03:34.769> node<00:03:35.100> that's<00:03:35.880> maybe<00:03:36.060> a<00:03:36.209> float<00:03:36.630> and

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
have a node that's maybe a float and

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.569 
have a node that's maybe a float and
it's<00:03:36.959> going<00:03:37.260> into<00:03:37.500> a<00:03:37.530> compound<00:03:38.130> node<00:03:38.370> so

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
it's going into a compound node so

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:40.430 
it's going into a compound node so
something<00:03:38.880> like<00:03:38.910> color<00:03:39.389> that's<00:03:39.660> a<00:03:39.720> compound

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
something like color that's a compound

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.050 
something like color that's a compound
of<00:03:40.530> red<00:03:40.709> green<00:03:40.859> and<00:03:40.980> blue<00:03:41.130> if<00:03:41.430> you<00:03:41.670> just<00:03:41.880> kind

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
of red green and blue if you just kind

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.370 
of red green and blue if you just kind
of<00:03:42.090> hover<00:03:42.299> that<00:03:42.510> close<00:03:42.720> to<00:03:42.840> it<00:03:42.930> it<00:03:42.989> Gray's<00:03:43.200> out

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
of hover that close to it it Gray's out

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.199 
of hover that close to it it Gray's out
at<00:03:43.560> first<00:03:43.769> but<00:03:44.280> Maya's<00:03:44.609> smart<00:03:44.970> enough<00:03:45.150> to

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
at first but Maya's smart enough to

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:46.400 
at first but Maya's smart enough to
think<00:03:45.359> all<00:03:45.720> right<00:03:45.840> well<00:03:45.989> maybe<00:03:46.139> I<00:03:46.230> should

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
think all right well maybe I should

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.229 
think all right well maybe I should
expand<00:03:46.889> that<00:03:47.010> out<00:03:47.069> so<00:03:47.700> that<00:03:47.819> you<00:03:47.910> can<00:03:48.030> get<00:03:48.120> in

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
expand that out so that you can get in

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.759 
expand that out so that you can get in
there<00:03:48.359> and<00:03:48.450> make<00:03:48.630> that<00:03:48.900> connection<00:03:49.170> so<00:03:49.530> you

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
there and make that connection so you

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.110 
there and make that connection so you
know<00:03:49.950> maybe<00:03:50.130> we'll<00:03:50.310> pipe<00:03:50.489> the<00:03:50.670> red<00:03:50.880> to<00:03:51.030> the

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
know maybe we'll pipe the red to the

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.000 
know maybe we'll pipe the red to the
blue<00:03:51.150> obviously<00:03:52.079> that's<00:03:52.530> not<00:03:52.650> what<00:03:52.769> we<00:03:52.859> want

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
blue obviously that's not what we want

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.830 
blue obviously that's not what we want
to<00:03:53.099> do<00:03:53.220> let's<00:03:53.489> go<00:03:53.609> ahead<00:03:53.670> and<00:03:53.849> get<00:03:54.630> this<00:03:54.780> guy

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
to do let's go ahead and get this guy

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.500 
to do let's go ahead and get this guy
back<00:03:55.200> to<00:03:55.260> just<00:03:55.620> being<00:03:55.739> sort<00:03:56.010> of<00:03:56.329> shoved<00:03:57.329> into

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
back to just being sort of shoved into

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.270 
back to just being sort of shoved into
the<00:03:57.660> color<00:03:57.840> there<00:03:58.079> so<00:03:58.109> let's<00:03:58.440> compress<00:03:59.130> that

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
the color there so let's compress that

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.460 
the color there so let's compress that
guy<00:03:59.489> back<00:03:59.700> down<00:04:00.000> so<00:04:00.900> the<00:04:01.049> next<00:04:01.200> thing<00:04:01.319> that<00:04:01.349> we

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:01.470 
guy back down so the next thing that we

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:02.900 
guy back down so the next thing that we
want<00:04:01.620> to<00:04:01.680> do<00:04:01.799> is<00:04:02.040> begin<00:04:02.430> working<00:04:02.700> with

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
want to do is begin working with

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.990 
want to do is begin working with
reflections<00:04:03.870> on<00:04:04.079> this<00:04:04.319> object<00:04:04.500> so<00:04:04.980> I've<00:04:05.819> got

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
reflections on this object so I've got

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.360 
reflections on this object so I've got
this<00:04:06.150> reflection<00:04:06.660> texture<00:04:07.650> map<00:04:07.799> in<00:04:07.950> my<00:04:08.069> scene

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
this reflection texture map in my scene

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.680 
this reflection texture map in my scene
and<00:04:08.669> whenever<00:04:09.150> you're<00:04:09.299> working<00:04:09.419> with

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
and whenever you're working with

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.210 
and whenever you're working with

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
reflection texture maps inside of Maya

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.849 
reflection texture maps inside of Maya
sort<00:04:11.519> of<00:04:11.609> cubic<00:04:12.419> environment<00:04:12.870> Maps<00:04:13.049> or<00:04:13.440> ball

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859 
sort of cubic environment Maps or ball

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:15.979 
sort of cubic environment Maps or ball

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
environment maps or spherical maps they

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.020 
environment maps or spherical maps they
need<00:04:16.169> to<00:04:16.260> pipe<00:04:16.500> through<00:04:16.889> an<00:04:17.099> environment<00:04:17.669> node

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
need to pipe through an environment node

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.000 
need to pipe through an environment node
now<00:04:18.810> luckily<00:04:19.049> I've<00:04:19.320> already<00:04:19.590> used<00:04:19.620> this

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
now luckily I've already used this

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.860 
now luckily I've already used this
reflection<00:04:20.430> texture<00:04:21.150> in<00:04:21.329> my<00:04:21.359> scene<00:04:21.690> in<00:04:21.810> a

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
reflection texture in my scene in a

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:22.940 
reflection texture in my scene in a
couple<00:04:22.079> of<00:04:22.109> different<00:04:22.349> places<00:04:22.500> so<00:04:22.800> I've

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
couple of different places so I've

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.409 
couple of different places so I've
already<00:04:23.099> got<00:04:23.400> that<00:04:23.580> environment<00:04:24.030> node<00:04:24.240> in

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
already got that environment node in

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:25.909 
already got that environment node in
there<00:04:24.599> it's<00:04:24.750> just<00:04:24.810> not<00:04:24.990> currently<00:04:25.500> shown<00:04:25.800> in

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
there it's just not currently shown in

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.140 
there it's just not currently shown in
my<00:04:26.010> graph<00:04:26.250> so<00:04:26.280> the<00:04:26.580> first<00:04:26.760> thing<00:04:26.880> we<00:04:26.970> want<00:04:27.120> to

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
my graph so the first thing we want to

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.150 
my graph so the first thing we want to
do<00:04:27.270> is<00:04:27.389> basically<00:04:27.960> display<00:04:28.770> the<00:04:28.979> output

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
do is basically display the output

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.610 
do is basically display the output
connections<00:04:29.849> of<00:04:30.180> this<00:04:30.660> shader<00:04:31.080> so<00:04:31.320> if<00:04:31.410> I<00:04:31.500> just

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620 
connections of this shader so if I just

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.040 
connections of this shader so if I just
go<00:04:31.740> to<00:04:31.800> my<00:04:31.919> output<00:04:32.099> connections<00:04:32.550> and<00:04:33.050> just

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
go to my output connections and just

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.420 
go to my output connections and just
hold<00:04:34.200> down<00:04:34.229> my<00:04:34.349> shift<00:04:34.500> key<00:04:34.860> when<00:04:34.979> I<00:04:35.010> click<00:04:35.250> that

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
hold down my shift key when I click that

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:36.980 
hold down my shift key when I click that
guy<00:04:35.610> you<00:04:35.849> can<00:04:36.060> see<00:04:36.210> that<00:04:36.330> it<00:04:36.419> basically<00:04:36.780> went

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
guy you can see that it basically went

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.110 
guy you can see that it basically went
and<00:04:37.169> added<00:04:37.349> to<00:04:37.770> my<00:04:37.919> graph

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
and added to my graph

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.880 
and added to my graph
the<00:04:39.330> output<00:04:39.810> connections<00:04:40.110> that<00:04:40.410> this<00:04:40.590> this

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
the output connections that this this

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.170 
the output connections that this this
guy<00:04:41.070> has<00:04:41.370> so<00:04:41.640> what<00:04:41.760> we're<00:04:41.850> gonna<00:04:41.910> do<00:04:42.030> is<00:04:42.090> we're

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
guy has so what we're gonna do is we're

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.020 
guy has so what we're gonna do is we're
going<00:04:42.270> to<00:04:42.330> grab<00:04:42.480> this<00:04:42.750> ball<00:04:43.650> and<00:04:44.070> we're<00:04:44.940> gonna

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
going to grab this ball and we're gonna

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.160 
going to grab this ball and we're gonna
take<00:04:45.480> its<00:04:45.630> out<00:04:45.810> color<00:04:47.660> and<00:04:48.660> we're<00:04:48.780> gonna<00:04:48.870> shove

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
take its out color and we're gonna shove

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.720 
take its out color and we're gonna shove
that<00:04:49.200> into<00:04:49.530> reflected<00:04:50.310> color<00:04:52.010> oops<00:04:53.010> let's<00:04:53.490> do

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.730 
that into reflected color oops let's do

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.150 
that into reflected color oops let's do
that<00:04:53.850> one<00:04:54.090> more<00:04:54.240> time<00:04:54.620> so<00:04:55.620> now<00:04:55.710> we've<00:04:55.860> got<00:04:56.010> that

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
that one more time so now we've got that

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.620 
that one more time so now we've got that
guy<00:04:56.310> piped<00:04:56.610> into<00:04:56.760> the<00:04:56.880> reflected<00:04:57.270> color<00:04:57.450> it

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
guy piped into the reflected color it

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:58.700 
guy piped into the reflected color it
looks<00:04:57.810> pretty<00:04:57.990> good<00:04:58.170> you<00:04:58.290> can<00:04:58.320> see<00:04:58.530> that<00:04:58.650> we

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
looks pretty good you can see that we

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.170 
looks pretty good you can see that we
now<00:04:58.860> have<00:04:58.890> sort<00:04:59.220> of<00:04:59.340> a<00:04:59.430> chrome<00:04:59.820> looking

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
now have sort of a chrome looking

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:01.880 
now have sort of a chrome looking
muffler<00:05:00.570> so<00:05:01.290> the<00:05:01.380> next<00:05:01.620> thing<00:05:01.710> that<00:05:01.740> we're

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:01.890 
muffler so the next thing that we're

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.140 
muffler so the next thing that we're
going<00:05:01.980> to<00:05:02.040> do<00:05:02.190> is<00:05:02.340> we're<00:05:02.460> going<00:05:02.490> to<00:05:02.610> use<00:05:02.670> a<00:05:02.880> node

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
going to do is we're going to use a node

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.060 
going to do is we're going to use a node
editor<00:05:03.420> to<00:05:03.600> start<00:05:03.840> to<00:05:03.930> create<00:05:04.110> some<00:05:04.290> new<00:05:04.800> nodes

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
editor to start to create some new nodes

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.820 
editor to start to create some new nodes
that<00:05:05.280> don't<00:05:05.490> exist<00:05:06.150> in<00:05:06.270> the<00:05:06.390> scene<00:05:06.660> to<00:05:07.200> modify

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
that don't exist in the scene to modify

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:09.860 
that don't exist in the scene to modify
the<00:05:08.340> way<00:05:08.490> that<00:05:08.670> reflection<00:05:09.060> looks<00:05:09.480> I<00:05:09.600> want<00:05:09.780> to

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
the way that reflection looks I want to

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.570 
the way that reflection looks I want to
have<00:05:09.960> sort<00:05:10.140> of<00:05:10.200> a<00:05:10.350> Fornell<00:05:10.800> effect<00:05:11.280> happening

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
have sort of a Fornell effect happening

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:13.490 
have sort of a Fornell effect happening
I<00:05:11.640> want<00:05:11.760> it<00:05:11.880> to<00:05:12.000> drop<00:05:12.240> off<00:05:12.540> and<00:05:12.810> sort<00:05:13.290> of<00:05:13.380> be

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
I want it to drop off and sort of be

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.230 
I want it to drop off and sort of be
reflected<00:05:13.980> on<00:05:14.040> the<00:05:14.130> edges<00:05:14.430> but<00:05:14.460> not<00:05:14.760> reflected

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
reflected on the edges but not reflected

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.120 
reflected on the edges but not reflected
in<00:05:15.300> the<00:05:15.420> center<00:05:15.720> of<00:05:15.750> the<00:05:15.900> object<00:05:16.320> so<00:05:16.860> to<00:05:16.920> do

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
in the center of the object so to do

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:18.590 
in the center of the object so to do
that<00:05:17.160> we're<00:05:17.460> gonna<00:05:17.520> grab<00:05:17.850> a<00:05:17.880> sampler<00:05:18.450> info

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 
that we're gonna grab a sampler info

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.150 
that we're gonna grab a sampler info
node<00:05:18.900> I'll<00:05:19.320> have<00:05:19.500> to<00:05:19.560> do<00:05:19.650> is<00:05:19.740> hit<00:05:19.800> the<00:05:19.890> tab<00:05:20.130> key

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
node I'll have to do is hit the tab key

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.760 
node I'll have to do is hit the tab key
to<00:05:20.580> begin<00:05:20.820> creating<00:05:21.090> new<00:05:21.240> nodes<00:05:21.480> start<00:05:22.320> typing

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
to begin creating new nodes start typing

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.360 
to begin creating new nodes start typing
out<00:05:22.920> what<00:05:23.100> I<00:05:23.130> want<00:05:23.370> to<00:05:23.430> get<00:05:23.610> let's<00:05:23.910> type<00:05:24.570> in

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
out what I want to get let's type in

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:31.160 
out what I want to get let's type in
sampler<00:05:26.450> so<00:05:28.910> we'll<00:05:29.910> grab<00:05:30.150> that<00:05:30.420> sampler<00:05:30.990> info

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:31.170 
sampler so we'll grab that sampler info

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.950 
sampler so we'll grab that sampler info
node<00:05:31.790> so<00:05:32.790> we've<00:05:32.880> got<00:05:33.030> the<00:05:33.150> sampler<00:05:33.480> info<00:05:33.600> node

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
node so we've got the sampler info node

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.110 
node so we've got the sampler info node
and<00:05:34.500> we<00:05:34.560> want<00:05:34.740> to<00:05:34.800> have<00:05:34.890> that<00:05:35.040> type<00:05:35.460> piped<00:05:35.820> into

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
and we want to have that type piped into

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.570 
and we want to have that type piped into
reflectivity<00:05:37.020> the<00:05:37.680> problem<00:05:38.070> with<00:05:38.220> this<00:05:38.370> is

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
reflectivity the problem with this is

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.550 
reflectivity the problem with this is
reflectivity<00:05:39.390> isn't<00:05:39.870> part<00:05:40.050> of<00:05:40.080> my<00:05:40.140> default

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
reflectivity isn't part of my default

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.080 
reflectivity isn't part of my default
list<00:05:40.830> so<00:05:40.980> we're<00:05:41.100> gonna<00:05:41.190> have<00:05:41.370> to<00:05:41.400> go<00:05:41.550> grab<00:05:41.850> this

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:42.090 
list so we're gonna have to go grab this

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.240 
list so we're gonna have to go grab this
node<00:05:42.330> expand<00:05:43.080> it<00:05:43.200> out<00:05:43.260> to<00:05:43.410> the<00:05:43.500> full<00:05:43.770> list<00:05:44.040> and

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
node expand it out to the full list and

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:45.680 
node expand it out to the full list and
trying<00:05:44.760> to<00:05:44.880> find<00:05:45.000> reflectivity

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
trying to find reflectivity

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.360 
trying to find reflectivity
it's<00:05:46.050> just<00:05:46.410> going<00:05:46.500> to<00:05:46.590> be<00:05:46.710> hard<00:05:46.920> so<00:05:47.130> what<00:05:47.250> we're

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
it's just going to be hard so what we're

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.110 
it's just going to be hard so what we're
gonna<00:05:47.460> do<00:05:47.610> is<00:05:47.700> we're<00:05:47.790> gonna<00:05:47.850> filter<00:05:48.480> out<00:05:48.660> what

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 
gonna do is we're gonna filter out what

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.700 
gonna do is we're gonna filter out what
is<00:05:51.120> being<00:05:51.360> displayed<00:05:51.780> in<00:05:52.260> that<00:05:52.350> list

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.710 
is being displayed in that list

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.680 
is being displayed in that list
something<00:05:53.580> that's<00:05:53.820> a<00:05:53.880> little<00:05:54.180> bit<00:05:54.360> easier<00:05:54.390> to

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:54.690 
something that's a little bit easier to

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:56.000 
something that's a little bit easier to
see<00:05:54.960> so<00:05:54.990> we'll<00:05:55.290> go<00:05:55.380> in<00:05:55.500> here<00:05:55.710> and<00:05:55.830> we'll<00:05:55.980> just

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.010 
see so we'll go in here and we'll just

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.880 
see so we'll go in here and we'll just
grab<00:05:56.400> the<00:05:56.870> facing<00:05:57.870> ratio<00:05:58.260> on<00:05:58.380> this<00:05:58.530> guy<00:05:58.650> would

00:05:58.880 --> 00:05:58.890 
grab the facing ratio on this guy would

00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:01.060 
grab the facing ratio on this guy would
look<00:05:59.040> at<00:05:59.130> the<00:05:59.250> attributes<00:05:59.730> that<00:05:59.820> this<00:06:00.030> has

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.070 
look at the attributes that this has

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.700 
look at the attributes that this has
grab<00:06:02.070> facing<00:06:02.580> ratio<00:06:02.940> and<00:06:03.360> we'll<00:06:04.020> put<00:06:04.200> that<00:06:04.350> to

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
grab facing ratio and we'll put that to

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.520 
grab facing ratio and we'll put that to
reflectivity<00:06:05.450> so<00:06:06.450> as<00:06:06.540> soon<00:06:06.690> as<00:06:06.780> I<00:06:06.870> do<00:06:06.930> that<00:06:07.050> you

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:07.530 
reflectivity so as soon as I do that you

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:09.050 
reflectivity so as soon as I do that you
can<00:06:07.650> see<00:06:07.800> that<00:06:07.920> that<00:06:08.040> reflection<00:06:08.370> changed<00:06:08.940> but

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
can see that that reflection changed but

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.370 
can see that that reflection changed but
it's<00:06:09.210> not<00:06:09.330> really<00:06:09.540> giving<00:06:09.690> me<00:06:09.930> the<00:06:10.020> effect

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380 
it's not really giving me the effect

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.100 
it's not really giving me the effect
that<00:06:10.530> I<00:06:10.650> want<00:06:10.980> so<00:06:11.460> we<00:06:11.610> need<00:06:11.760> to<00:06:11.850> modify<00:06:12.300> what

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
that I want so we need to modify what

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.840 
that I want so we need to modify what
this<00:06:13.260> facing<00:06:13.470> ratio<00:06:14.010> is<00:06:14.130> providing<00:06:14.580> right<00:06:14.730> now

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:14.850 
this facing ratio is providing right now

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:16.490 
this facing ratio is providing right now
it's<00:06:15.000> providing<00:06:15.390> zero<00:06:15.810> to<00:06:15.930> one<00:06:16.110> value<00:06:16.470> that's

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:16.500 
it's providing zero to one value that's

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.440 
it's providing zero to one value that's
just<00:06:16.920> linear<00:06:17.160> from<00:06:17.460> the<00:06:17.640> normals<00:06:18.030> facing<00:06:18.360> the

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:18.450 
just linear from the normals facing the

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:19.580 
just linear from the normals facing the
camera<00:06:18.720> to<00:06:18.810> the<00:06:18.900> normals<00:06:19.170> facing<00:06:19.440> away<00:06:19.500> from

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:19.590 
camera to the normals facing away from

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:21.740 
camera to the normals facing away from
the<00:06:19.740> camera<00:06:19.830> so<00:06:20.580> to<00:06:20.640> modify<00:06:21.180> that<00:06:21.450> I'm<00:06:21.600> going

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:21.750 
the camera so to modify that I'm going

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:23.390 
the camera so to modify that I'm going
to<00:06:21.810> pass<00:06:22.020> it<00:06:22.200> through<00:06:22.350> a<00:06:22.440> ramp<00:06:22.800> so<00:06:23.070> again<00:06:23.250> we'll

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.400 
to pass it through a ramp so again we'll

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.770 
to pass it through a ramp so again we'll
hit<00:06:23.460> the<00:06:23.580> tab<00:06:23.790> key<00:06:24.000> to<00:06:24.030> create<00:06:24.330> a<00:06:24.360> new<00:06:24.570> node

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:24.780 
hit the tab key to create a new node

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:27.050 
hit the tab key to create a new node
we'll<00:06:25.590> start<00:06:25.770> typing<00:06:26.100> ramp<00:06:26.400> I'm<00:06:26.670> going<00:06:27.000> to

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060 
we'll start typing ramp I'm going to

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.120 
we'll start typing ramp I'm going to
create<00:06:27.180> a<00:06:27.270> ramp<00:06:27.480> texture<00:06:28.050> now<00:06:28.710> this<00:06:28.890> ramp

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:29.130 
create a ramp texture now this ramp

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:30.440 
create a ramp texture now this ramp
texture<00:06:29.550> I<00:06:29.580> don't<00:06:29.820> need<00:06:30.030> the<00:06:30.210> text

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:30.450 
texture I don't need the text

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:31.700 
texture I don't need the text
replacement<00:06:30.690> node<00:06:31.050> for<00:06:31.230> that<00:06:31.320> because<00:06:31.470> we're

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:31.710 
replacement node for that because we're

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:33.110 
replacement node for that because we're
just<00:06:31.830> going<00:06:31.950> to<00:06:32.010> be<00:06:32.100> using<00:06:32.280> the<00:06:32.460> ramp<00:06:32.670> as<00:06:32.850> a

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120 
just going to be using the ramp as a

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.110 
just going to be using the ramp as a
modifier<00:06:33.860> we're<00:06:34.860> this<00:06:35.010> is<00:06:35.070> a<00:06:35.220> V<00:06:35.460> chord<00:06:35.730> ramp<00:06:35.970> by

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.120 
modifier we're this is a V chord ramp by

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.460 
modifier we're this is a V chord ramp by
default<00:06:36.480> so<00:06:36.660> what<00:06:36.810> we<00:06:36.900> want<00:06:37.050> to<00:06:37.110> do<00:06:37.170> is<00:06:37.260> we<00:06:37.320> want

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:37.470 
default so what we want to do is we want

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:39.680 
default so what we want to do is we want
to<00:06:37.530> take<00:06:37.650> that<00:06:37.770> facing<00:06:38.250> ratio<00:06:38.730> and<00:06:39.330> we<00:06:39.450> want<00:06:39.600> to

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:39.690 
to take that facing ratio and we want to

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:42.800 
to take that facing ratio and we want to
have<00:06:39.810> it<00:06:39.930> pipe<00:06:40.170> into<00:06:40.470> the<00:06:40.920> V<00:06:41.100> chord<00:06:41.520> of<00:06:41.790> of<00:06:42.330> this

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:42.810 
have it pipe into the V chord of of this

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:45.260 
have it pipe into the V chord of of this
ramp<00:06:43.110> so<00:06:43.380> again<00:06:43.620> if<00:06:44.130> I<00:06:44.250> use<00:06:44.400> the<00:06:44.580> V<00:06:44.790> key<00:06:45.060> to

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:45.270 
ramp so again if I use the V key to

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:46.640 
ramp so again if I use the V key to
filter<00:06:45.720> down<00:06:45.840> what<00:06:46.020> we're<00:06:46.170> seeing<00:06:46.380> there

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:46.650 
filter down what we're seeing there

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:49.550 
filter down what we're seeing there
we'll<00:06:47.370> grab<00:06:47.580> that<00:06:47.610> facing<00:06:48.180> ratio<00:06:48.570> notice<00:06:49.470> that

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:49.560 
we'll grab that facing ratio notice that

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.830 
we'll grab that facing ratio notice that
it's<00:06:49.680> going<00:06:49.770> to<00:06:49.860> expand<00:06:50.610> out<00:06:50.850> that<00:06:51.060> so<00:06:51.600> I<00:06:51.630> can

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:51.840 
it's going to expand out that so I can

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:52.850 
it's going to expand out that so I can
get<00:06:51.990> to<00:06:52.020> that<00:06:52.200> V<00:06:52.410> chord

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:52.860 
get to that V chord

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.760 
get to that V chord
nice<00:06:53.219> automatically<00:06:54.139> sort<00:06:55.139> of<00:06:55.229> push<00:06:55.409> that<00:06:55.560> guy

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:55.770 
nice automatically sort of push that guy

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:59.450 
nice automatically sort of push that guy
over<00:06:55.949> there<00:06:56.689> now<00:06:57.689> we'll<00:06:57.900> grab<00:06:58.080> the<00:06:58.379> out<00:06:59.069> color

00:06:59.450 --> 00:06:59.460 
over there now we'll grab the out color

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.580 
over there now we'll grab the out color
for<00:06:59.699> this<00:06:59.789> guy<00:06:59.969> so<00:07:00.000> let's<00:07:00.509> just<00:07:00.689> grab<00:07:00.930> one<00:07:01.500> of

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:01.590 
for this guy so let's just grab one of

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:05.089 
for this guy so let's just grab one of
the<00:07:01.680> attributes<00:07:01.830> just<00:07:02.340> out<00:07:02.520> red<00:07:03.919> throw<00:07:04.919> that

00:07:05.089 --> 00:07:05.099 
the attributes just out red throw that

00:07:05.099 --> 00:07:07.760 
the attributes just out red throw that
into<00:07:05.219> the<00:07:05.310> reflectivity<00:07:05.819> slot<00:07:06.500> looks<00:07:07.500> like<00:07:07.650> I

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:07.770 
into the reflectivity slot looks like I

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:11.209 
into the reflectivity slot looks like I
missed<00:07:08.039> my<00:07:08.189> connection<00:07:08.520> there<00:07:09.949> so<00:07:10.949> we've<00:07:11.069> got

00:07:11.209 --> 00:07:11.219 
missed my connection there so we've got

00:07:11.219 --> 00:07:12.469 
missed my connection there so we've got
the<00:07:11.340> out<00:07:11.490> red<00:07:11.819> flowing<00:07:12.270> into<00:07:12.389> that

00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:12.479 
the out red flowing into that

00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:13.850 
the out red flowing into that
reflectivity<00:07:13.020> so<00:07:13.319> you<00:07:13.409> can<00:07:13.530> see<00:07:13.650> that<00:07:13.740> it

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:13.860 
reflectivity so you can see that it

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.559 
reflectivity so you can see that it
looks<00:07:13.889> a<00:07:14.099> little<00:07:14.189> bit<00:07:14.400> different<00:07:14.520> we'll<00:07:15.360> jump

00:07:15.559 --> 00:07:15.569 
looks a little bit different we'll jump

00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:16.459 
looks a little bit different we'll jump
into<00:07:15.750> this<00:07:15.870> ramp

00:07:16.459 --> 00:07:16.469 
into this ramp

00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:19.369 
into this ramp
we'll<00:07:16.919> just<00:07:17.189> kind<00:07:17.400> of<00:07:17.460> make<00:07:17.669> the<00:07:18.330> bottom<00:07:18.750> white

00:07:19.369 --> 00:07:19.379 
we'll just kind of make the bottom white

00:07:19.379 --> 00:07:22.490 
we'll just kind of make the bottom white
and<00:07:19.650> the<00:07:20.280> top<00:07:20.550> black<00:07:21.240> and<00:07:21.599> now<00:07:21.930> I<00:07:21.960> can<00:07:22.169> use<00:07:22.199> this

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:22.500 
and the top black and now I can use this

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:24.800 
and the top black and now I can use this
ramp<00:07:22.800> to<00:07:22.949> really<00:07:23.159> start<00:07:23.370> to<00:07:23.580> adjust<00:07:24.090> you<00:07:24.780> know

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:24.810 
ramp to really start to adjust you know

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:26.839 
ramp to really start to adjust you know
where<00:07:25.259> are<00:07:25.409> my<00:07:25.590> reflections<00:07:26.159> at<00:07:26.340> what's<00:07:26.729> it

00:07:26.839 --> 00:07:26.849 
where are my reflections at what's it

00:07:26.849 --> 00:07:27.980 
where are my reflections at what's it
going<00:07:26.969> to<00:07:27.029> look<00:07:27.120> like<00:07:27.270> is<00:07:27.629> it<00:07:27.719> going<00:07:27.810> to<00:07:27.900> be

00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:27.990 
going to look like is it going to be

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:29.959 
going to look like is it going to be
glancing<00:07:28.259> is<00:07:28.620> it<00:07:28.710> going<00:07:28.830> to<00:07:28.889> be<00:07:29.009> you<00:07:29.610> know<00:07:29.699> add

00:07:29.959 --> 00:07:29.969 
glancing is it going to be you know add

00:07:29.969 --> 00:07:31.730 
glancing is it going to be you know add
a<00:07:30.000> little<00:07:30.210> bit<00:07:30.360> more<00:07:30.539> in<00:07:30.629> there<00:07:30.840> so<00:07:31.469> it's<00:07:31.560> sort

00:07:31.730 --> 00:07:31.740 
a little bit more in there so it's sort
