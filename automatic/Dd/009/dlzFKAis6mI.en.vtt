00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
genotype you can maximize weight loss so

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.650 
genotype you can maximize weight loss so
if<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.609> want<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:03.000> lose<00:01:03.149> weight<00:01:03.390> without

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
if you want to lose weight without

if you want to lose weight without
wasting<00:01:04.290> time<00:01:04.470> make<00:01:05.250> this<00:01:05.519> your<00:01:06.060> very<00:01:06.390> first

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
wasting time make this your very first

step the older I get the harder it is to

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.100 
step the older I get the harder it is to
stay<00:01:10.560> in<00:01:10.590> shape<00:01:11.070> so<00:01:11.939> with<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.119> million<00:01:12.659> diets

out<00:01:13.320> there<00:01:13.380> how<00:01:14.250> did<00:01:14.310> I<00:01:14.520> pick<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.880> right<00:01:15.030> one

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
out there how did I pick the right one

for<00:01:15.270> me<00:01:15.770> easy<00:01:16.770> I<00:01:17.220> took<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:17.939> test<00:01:18.240> just<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:19.590> swab

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
for me easy I took a test just to swab

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.630 
for me easy I took a test just to swab
at<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.159> cheek<00:01:20.400> then<00:01:20.880> off<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.540> lab<00:01:22.640> once
