00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.680
 Today we are going to experience Porsche completely 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.510
 differently we take part in an eco 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.950
 Rally There are two teams each 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.660
 from Germany Austria and the 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.730
 switzerland it is about as little as 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.509
 possible to use fuel or energy 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.600
 to use 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.520
 Let's see how we beat ours 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.050
 vehicle becomes a porsche cayenne 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.590
 not necessarily with low 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.210
 Gasoline consumption associated 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.250
 but if you have a cayenne s 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.769
 then a hybrid is on the way 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.340
 careful gas foot to surprises 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.899
 to lead 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.630
 our participant vehicle here at the 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.640
 eco rallye is a porsche cayenne s 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:41.910
 hybrid, we are talking about a pan 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.430
 system power of 416 ps so 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.219
 neat bums, especially since we 5 190 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.840
 newtonmeter have maximum torque 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:50.520
 propulsion should not be a problem 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.379
 But it's about saving energy 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.629
 or energy saving and 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.059
 Porsche indicates the vehicle with 3,4 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.260
 Let's use standard consumption on what if we 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.160
 really comes during the rally 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.159
 Schavan later from the outside is the cayenne 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.630
 s hybrid on his brake calipers in asset 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.799
 green as well as the corresponding 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.240
 deposited writings recognizable 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.760
 otherwise our four is different 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.220
 meter 85 long and almost two meters 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.650
 broad rally does not endanger his 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.509
 Brothers His services are ours 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.509
 vehicle from a three-liter v6 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.420
 Compressor engine coupled with a 95 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.159
 ps strong electric engine that's us 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.250
 have a system really power enough 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.930
 we can be up to 36 purely electric 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.479
 kilometer ride and that with a 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.700
 peak speed of 125 maximum 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.600
 km h I think that is more than 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.009
 everyday use 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.229
 our trip takes us over curvy 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.350
 country roads and through picturesque villages 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.270
 once around Lake Constance 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.399
 whether the modern drive of our cayenne 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.670
 Here, its saving potential can unfold 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:57.080
 has yet to turn out 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.600
 all participants have tried hard 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.789
 to be as economical as possible 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.280
 the perfect recipe for saving fuel 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:05.920
 but it does not seem to be found yet 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.850
 the first days were very mixed 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.950
 I have to be a bit on the car 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.620
 because there is a lot 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.880
 weight is there and it is moving 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.470
 was as much a learning process as can be 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.310
 I work with the battery one sets 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.650
 the combustor 1 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.150
 and I think we are currently in good shape 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.600
 Mittelfeld but there is still air 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.730
 above 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.980
 So there is still potential for 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.630
 improvements especially if you during 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.910
 The break opportunity had the 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.239
 to exchange experiences made 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:34.060
 the Porsche cayenne s hybrid sets in motion 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.209
 the combination of electrical and 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.000
 internal combustion engine 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.280
 he can not do so only by so-called 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.690
 recuperation brake energy store 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.970
 but thanks to his under the 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.930
 Load compartment attached battery too 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:46.930
 drive purely electric 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.200
 a porsche is not home-made 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.910
 especially loud when we are quite comfortable 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.010
 glide but what is noticeable 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.019
 our eco rallye as soon as we arrive in one 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.640
 Village or a city come on the switch 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:00.739
 vehicle around and we drive thanks to plug in 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.930
 hybrid pure electric that has two 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:04.790
 Giant benefits for a great for the 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.790
 environment because zero emission to another 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.019
 extremely quiet awfully relaxed and so on 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.930
 you can see the prospects much better 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.370
 enjoy 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.439
 we try the relationship between 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.400
 the electric drive and the use 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:20.659
 to perfect the ottomotors 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.400
 while we are the landscape around the 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:24.049
 Lake Constance is ours 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.670
 Consumption during the second stage 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:30.170
 almost unnoticed direction 6 liters 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:33.349
 The task of the rally is clear 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.150
 defined with as little energy as possible 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:37.700
 to reach the goal 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.980
 but if you have a porsche with over 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.200
 400 horse under the butt has then 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.340
 you should also try what for 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.379
 that are capable 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.579
 We are on a coral though 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:48.379
 you a vehicle with so much power 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:50.659
 have fun somehow too 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:53.769
 or problem again from what sport plus 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:53.769
 previously practiced 8 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:02.060
 it's okay but not 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:04.550
 In the end, it is not for the 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.820
 first place may be enough 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:09.710
 because of our little outlier the 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:12.410
 best participant of our group was im 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:15.110
 overall average of only 4.9 liters 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:17.810
 the worst one liter higher 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.550
 that was the porsche eco rallye now 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.280
 are we on target have managed three 

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:24.110
 Altogether about 350 kilometers 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.090
 after each stop probably the vehicle 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.070
 completely fueled or the 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.360
 recharged battery what you have achieved 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.280
 in spite of the services that are 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:35.900
 vehicle has average consumption like that 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:38.650
 between 45 to 58 59 liters I think 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.650
 We did quite well
