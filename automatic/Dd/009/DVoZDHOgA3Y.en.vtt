00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.140 
feeling the rope and they're extremely
light<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.100> lot<00:01:20.220> of<00:01:20.340> people<00:01:20.610> do<00:01:20.790> them<00:01:21.030> and

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
light and a lot of people do them and

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.670 
light and a lot of people do them and
say<00:01:21.270> oh<00:01:21.299> I<00:01:21.450> can<00:01:21.689> do<00:01:21.780> doubles<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.229> triples<00:01:22.350> and

say oh I can do doubles and triples and
stuff<00:01:22.860> like<00:01:23.009> that<00:01:23.220> but<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.520> Rope<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:23.880> so<00:01:24.119> light

stuff like that but the Rope is so light
it<00:01:25.380> really<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:26.250> think<00:01:26.939> it's<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.180> cheat<00:01:27.479> so<00:01:28.140> when<00:01:28.409> I

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
it really I think it's a cheat so when I

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.200 
it really I think it's a cheat so when I
talk<00:01:28.890> about<00:01:28.920> jumping<00:01:29.610> rope<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:29.909> doing

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.859 
talk about jumping rope and doing
doubles<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:31.549> always<00:01:32.549> consider<00:01:33.299> it<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:33.630> jump

doubles I always consider it you jump

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.600 
doubles I always consider it you jump
with<00:01:33.990> a<00:01:34.049> beaded<00:01:34.470> rope<00:01:34.650> or<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:34.950> jump<00:01:35.430> with<00:01:35.579> a

reps<00:03:35.780> so<00:03:36.409> check<00:03:36.620> this<00:03:36.799> out<00:03:37.010> here<00:03:37.760> we<00:03:37.879> go<00:03:38.060> and<00:03:38.269> he

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569 
reps so check this out here we go and he

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.080 
reps so check this out here we go and he
started<00:03:38.989> just<00:03:39.230> from<00:03:39.469> straight<00:03:39.739> no<00:03:40.519> pretty

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
started just from straight no pretty

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:53.370 
started just from straight no pretty
rough

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.510 

that<00:03:54.380> was<00:03:54.680> hard

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:55.520 
that was hard

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.890 
that was hard
that's<00:03:56.300> incredible<00:03:57.470> exercise<00:03:58.310> and<00:03:58.900> the

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
that's incredible exercise and the

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.240 
that's incredible exercise and the
reason<00:04:00.230> why<00:04:00.319> I<00:04:00.350> love<00:04:00.590> this<00:04:00.740> so<00:04:00.920> much<00:04:01.069> is

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
reason why I love this so much is

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.150 
reason why I love this so much is
because<00:04:01.610> the<00:04:02.620> gets<00:04:03.620> your<00:04:03.709> heart<00:04:03.890> rate<00:04:04.130> up

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
because the gets your heart rate up

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.570 
because the gets your heart rate up
you're<00:04:04.940> getting<00:04:05.209> a<00:04:05.300> maximally<00:04:05.990> strong

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
you're getting a maximally strong

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.699 
you're getting a maximally strong
contraction<00:04:07.580> in<00:04:07.700> your<00:04:07.760> muscles<00:04:08.660> when<00:04:09.350> people

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
contraction in your muscles when people

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:13.750 
contraction in your muscles when people
run<00:04:10.069> or<00:04:10.910> jog<00:04:11.530> there's<00:04:12.530> no<00:04:12.680> strong<00:04:13.069> contraction

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
run or jog there's no strong contraction

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.910 
run or jog there's no strong contraction
in<00:04:13.880> the<00:04:13.970> arms<00:04:14.360> and<00:04:14.540> then<00:04:15.290> there<00:04:15.470> are<00:04:15.560> moving

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
in the arms and then there are moving

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.009 
in the arms and then there are moving
across<00:04:16.190> the<00:04:16.310> ground<00:04:16.760> in<00:04:17.060> a<00:04:17.120> horizontal<00:04:17.450> manner

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
across the ground in a horizontal manner

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.069 
across the ground in a horizontal manner
and<00:04:19.209> gravity<00:04:20.209> is<00:04:20.239> sort<00:04:20.419> of<00:04:20.450> just<00:04:20.660> pulling<00:04:20.989> them

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 
and gravity is sort of just pulling them

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:24.640 
and gravity is sort of just pulling them
forward<00:04:21.590> now<00:04:22.340> when<00:04:22.550> you<00:04:22.730> when<00:04:23.720> you<00:04:23.870> jump<00:04:24.410> rope

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
forward now when you when you jump rope

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.620 
forward now when you when you jump rope
you're<00:04:25.040> vertically<00:04:25.490> displacing<00:04:26.210> yourself

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
you're vertically displacing yourself

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.420 
you're vertically displacing yourself
and<00:04:26.870> the<00:04:27.320> action<00:04:27.740> of<00:04:27.860> your<00:04:27.980> arm<00:04:28.190> will<00:04:28.400> be

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
and the action of your arm will be

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.909 
and the action of your arm will be
forward<00:04:28.850> and<00:04:28.940> backwards<00:04:29.450> quickly<00:04:30.140> and<00:04:30.770> with

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 
forward and backwards quickly and with

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:33.340 
forward and backwards quickly and with

contraction<00:04:41.990> what<00:04:42.140> does<00:04:42.290> that<00:04:42.320> do<00:04:42.710> it<00:04:42.919> helps

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
contraction what does that do it helps

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.330 
contraction what does that do it helps
to<00:04:43.700> build<00:04:43.880> muscle<00:04:44.479> and<00:04:44.630> cut<00:04:44.870> body<00:04:45.140> fat<00:04:45.500> jumping

rope<00:04:46.490> is<00:04:46.669> one<00:04:46.880> of<00:04:47.000> the<00:04:47.120> most<00:04:47.300> incredible<00:04:48.110> tools

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
rope is one of the most incredible tools

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.680 
rope is one of the most incredible tools
you<00:04:48.740> can<00:04:48.919> have<00:04:49.160> back<00:04:49.970> in<00:04:50.150> the<00:04:50.240> day<00:04:50.389> they<00:04:50.540> had<00:04:50.660> a

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
you can have back in the day they had a

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.600 
you can have back in the day they had a
study<00:04:50.990> that<00:04:51.229> ten<00:04:51.500> minutes<00:04:51.950> of<00:04:52.100> jumping<00:04:52.430> rope

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
study that ten minutes of jumping rope

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.960 
study that ten minutes of jumping rope
is<00:04:52.910> equal<00:04:53.540> to<00:04:53.720> 30<00:04:54.169> minutes<00:04:54.590> of<00:04:54.710> jogging<00:04:55.070> then

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
is equal to 30 minutes of jogging then

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:57.820 
is equal to 30 minutes of jogging then
and<00:04:56.270> the<00:04:56.390> reason<00:04:56.720> I<00:04:56.810> just<00:04:56.990> explained<00:04:57.470> is<00:04:57.620> why

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
and the reason I just explained is why

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.650 
and the reason I just explained is why
because<00:04:58.340> you're<00:04:58.460> vertically<00:04:58.910> displacing

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
because you're vertically displacing

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.900 
because you're vertically displacing
yourself<00:05:00.050> which<00:05:00.830> takes<00:05:01.100> more<00:05:01.310> energy<00:05:01.760> than

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910 
yourself which takes more energy than

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.240 
yourself which takes more energy than
just<00:05:02.180> plotting<00:05:02.690> forward<00:05:03.169> and<00:05:03.320> it's<00:05:04.070> that

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:04.250 
just plotting forward and it's that

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:06.880 
just plotting forward and it's that
accent<00:05:04.640> of<00:05:04.790> the<00:05:04.820> arms<00:05:05.300> that<00:05:06.260> in<00:05:06.500> the<00:05:06.590> fact<00:05:06.800> that

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:06.890 
accent of the arms that in the fact that

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:08.800 
accent of the arms that in the fact that
you<00:05:07.039> have<00:05:07.250> to<00:05:07.430> keep<00:05:07.669> that<00:05:07.850> rhythm<00:05:08.150> with<00:05:08.479> it

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
you have to keep that rhythm with it

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.960 
you have to keep that rhythm with it
there's<00:05:09.289> no<00:05:09.470> comparison<00:05:09.830> jumping<00:05:10.580> rope<00:05:10.729> is
