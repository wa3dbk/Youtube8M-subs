but<00:03:13.760> we'll<00:03:14.760> get<00:03:14.910> it<00:03:15.060> there<00:03:15.680> like<00:03:16.680> I<00:03:16.800> said<00:03:17.040> it's

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
but we'll get it there like I said it's

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.940 
but we'll get it there like I said it's
got<00:03:17.280> 390<00:03:17.790> big<00:03:17.970> block<00:03:18.180> in<00:03:18.390> it<00:03:18.500> and<00:03:19.500> she'll<00:03:19.739> pop

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
got 390 big block in it and she'll pop

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.360 
got 390 big block in it and she'll pop
there's<00:03:20.610> there's<00:03:21.330> the<00:03:21.420> 390<00:03:21.959> it's<00:03:22.830> a<00:03:22.890> really

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
there's there's the 390 it's a really

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.400 
there's there's the 390 it's a really
really<00:03:23.790> strong<00:03:24.090> running<00:03:24.480> motor

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
really strong running motor

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.210 
really strong running motor
it's<00:03:26.310> got<00:03:26.430> straight<00:03:26.700> pipes<00:03:26.910> on<00:03:27.120> right<00:03:27.360> now<00:03:27.510> and

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
it's got straight pipes on right now and

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.920 
it's got straight pipes on right now and
long<00:03:29.220> tube<00:03:29.430> headers<00:03:29.730> so<00:03:30.120> it<00:03:30.209> sounds<00:03:30.660> mean<00:03:30.870> but

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
long tube headers so it sounds mean but

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.860 
long tube headers so it sounds mean but
it<00:03:31.170> makes<00:03:31.560> a<00:03:31.650> ton<00:03:31.830> of<00:03:31.890> power<00:03:32.390> and<00:03:33.390> it's<00:03:33.600> really

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
it makes a ton of power and it's really

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.890 
it makes a ton of power and it's really
healthy<00:03:34.260> motor<00:03:34.560> so<00:03:35.489> it's<00:03:36.150> gonna<00:03:36.270> stay<00:03:36.780> in

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
healthy motor so it's gonna stay in

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.140 
healthy motor so it's gonna stay in
there<00:03:37.080> the<00:03:37.200> way<00:03:37.320> it<00:03:37.350> is<00:03:37.530> right<00:03:37.800> now<00:03:37.940> how<00:03:38.940> you<00:03:38.970> do
