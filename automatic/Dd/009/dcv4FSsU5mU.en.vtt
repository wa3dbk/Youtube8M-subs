00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.210
 Czech 

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:22.929
 we ordered and the round took the new 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:25.689
 version of nc which is now 750 x has 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:27.759
 also in black to white color continues to 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:30.359
 be sold and red is no longer 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:30.359
 produced 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.920
 the great news is the same engine that 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.880
 gained 75 cubic centimeters 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:43.390
 she went from 670 to 745 centimeters 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.390
 public 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:50.740
 she also won half a kilo of the torque 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:56.400
 which was 6.4 went to 6.94 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:59.250
 kilograms-force meter at 4,750 turns 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.080
 what has changed in the vice-leader engine and the 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.290
 parallel with four valves per 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.810
 cylinder and cognition functioning there are 270 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.930
 degrees was the course diameter ratio of 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.930
 piston 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:17.540
 the size of the piston that was 73 was to 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:21.820
 77 mm and the course kept the 80 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.820
 the touch became larger 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.520
 What happens is that now this touch to 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.500
 power appears in a more 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.980
 down 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.690
 she also won 400 final spins 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:36.790
 so now she's cutting more in 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.240
 about six thousand seven hundred 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.240
 turns 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.390
 another novelty of this engine was the gain 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.460
 a second set of balance sheets that 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.680
 is at the top rear of the engine 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.470
 with this happened the engine rollers 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.450
 picture and soft or 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.370
 you take a long hard road one 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.950
 long- term travel 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.810
 by carone also the clear pilot is 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:03.880
 much more comfortable because the bike 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:08.320
 much less and even with this gain 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:10.390
 of torque and power at 750 was 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.430
 I myself have not yet made the 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.850
 but the institute did not 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.100
 compared to beginners in tuscon at 750 and 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:21.100
 reached the conclusion of the average consumption 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.530
 measuring 28 km city road 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.520
 and a half per liter of fuel, ie 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.070
 so if you walk in speed 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:30.670
 constant on the road she does there 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:33.580
 at least 32 kilometers per liter at the pump 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.560
 of internal fuel into the tank 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.070
 liquid cooling and injection 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.709
 electronics 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:44.110
 chassis and design remain the same 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.750
 there also that this chest here continues 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.970
 this chest here forward way 21 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.280
 liters that you can put on a helmet 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.290
 closed here I do not use the 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.989
 helmet that I tie behind I put 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.750
 here photographic camera button paninhas 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:01.480
 that is enough fits here in 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.540
 another novelty is the bank that now has 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.130
 a texture so it has a bigger grip 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.989
 you do not slide on the bench it is not 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:11.760
 smooth ride also that does not fall 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:11.760
 on top of you in case of braking, huh? 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.560
 the original tire is now another is the 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:22.500
 pirelli scorpion that he has the drawing 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.269
 a little more pointed or he has - 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.670
 the area of â€‹â€‹contact with the ground while 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.260
 you're straight with that the bike stays 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.939
 lighter mainly for the curve 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.980
 low to walk in traffic these 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:33.959
 things 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.269
 the panel remains the same 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.769
 now have gait indicator and consumption 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:41.659
 snapshot and it's the way I like it 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.659
 Easy to read black white 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:52.750
 she arrives with price of 28 1990 the version 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:55.110
 without abs and 31,100 a with the base abs are 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.110
 Paulo 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:10.510
 It's good for those who comment on my 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.070
 videos saying that I just compliment that I 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.650
 I only speak well of motorbikes. 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:17.320
 I'll explain, I commend the motorcycles. 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.910
 because I love motorcycles then all 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.160
 any motorcycle for me is 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.950
 Wonderful, I have the goal of 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:26.110
 to present the products to you 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.810
 they offer and not what they do not 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:31.330
 offer any motorcyclist 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:34.150
 who is going to buy your product be it there 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.970
 Whats it important for me to buy happy? 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.650
 of gay life and that you will enjoy this 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.230
 two-wheeled vehicle in any and all 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:44.020
 After all, we will live with 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.580
 many thousands of kilometers and 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.040
 People need to be happy with him, the people. 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.870
 need to understand and love 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.430
 in the same way with the marriage that 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.200
 product the way it is
