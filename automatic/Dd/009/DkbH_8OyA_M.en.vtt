00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.659 
passion and an understanding of the land
I<00:03:18.359> think<00:03:18.930> this<00:03:19.230> is<00:03:19.380> cattle<00:03:19.709> country<00:03:19.739> um<00:03:20.220> we

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:20.669 
I think this is cattle country um we

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:21.890 
I think this is cattle country um we
have<00:03:20.790> a<00:03:20.849> very<00:03:21.060> short<00:03:21.269> growing<00:03:21.450> season

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
have a very short growing season

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.150 
have a very short growing season
especially<00:03:22.290> in<00:03:22.380> this<00:03:22.470> valley<00:03:22.709> there's<00:03:23.010> not

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
especially in this valley there's not

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.650 
especially in this valley there's not
very<00:03:23.190> many<00:03:23.459> for<00:03:23.700> us<00:03:23.760> three<00:03:23.970> days<00:03:24.090> a<00:03:24.150> year<00:03:24.389> so

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
very many for us three days a year so

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.990 
very many for us three days a year so
the<00:03:25.260> land<00:03:25.470> is<00:03:25.650> really<00:03:26.099> best<00:03:26.370> for<00:03:26.549> cattle<00:03:26.849> we

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
the land is really best for cattle we

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.849 
the land is really best for cattle we
can't<00:03:27.209> grow<00:03:27.329> green<00:03:27.569> here<00:03:27.840> and<00:03:28.560> something

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
can't grow green here and something

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:30.650 
can't grow green here and something
needs<00:03:28.980> to<00:03:29.040> eat<00:03:29.130> the<00:03:29.280> grass<00:03:29.459> so<00:03:29.790> so<00:03:30.150> cattle<00:03:30.540> is

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
needs to eat the grass so so cattle is

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.000 
needs to eat the grass so so cattle is
cattle<00:03:31.230> country<00:03:31.260> is<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:31.739> best<00:03:31.889> way<00:03:31.980> to

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
cattle country is the best way to

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.030 
cattle country is the best way to
describe<00:03:32.340> it<00:03:32.810> there's<00:03:33.810> no<00:03:33.989> doubt<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.650> Simpson

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
describe it there's no doubt the Simpson

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.250 
describe it there's no doubt the Simpson

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.600 
ranch is fenced off into quarter
sections<00:03:57.440> so<00:03:57.620> we<00:03:57.650> move<00:03:57.920> cattle<00:03:58.129> from<00:03:58.340> field

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610

calm thing we don't want to get them
around<00:04:15.920> riled<00:04:16.579> up<00:04:16.639> or<00:04:16.850> roundup<00:04:17.209> we<00:04:17.359> just<00:04:17.540> want

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
around riled up or roundup we just want

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:18.969 
around riled up or roundup we just want

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:18.979 
to move them into the next field and

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:20.500 
to move them into the next field and
usually<00:04:19.519> they<00:04:19.639> understand<00:04:20.030> what's<00:04:20.150> going<00:04:20.389> on

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
usually they understand what's going on

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:21.640 
usually they understand what's going on
and<00:04:20.690> they<00:04:20.750> know<00:04:20.870> that<00:04:20.900> typically<00:04:21.470> they're

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
and they know that typically they're

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.050 
and they know that typically they're
going<00:04:21.859> somewhere<00:04:21.979> where<00:04:22.250> more<00:04:22.370> grasses<00:04:22.850> so

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
going somewhere where more grasses so

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:31.780 
going somewhere where more grasses so
they're<00:04:23.210> pretty<00:04:23.330> happy<00:04:23.570> to<00:04:23.660> do<00:04:23.750> it

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:31.790 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.000 

I<00:04:31.850> think<00:04:32.810> a<00:04:32.870> good<00:04:32.990> ranch<00:04:33.230> horse<00:04:33.530> is<00:04:33.710> the<00:04:33.830> tool

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
I think a good ranch horse is the tool

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.100 
I think a good ranch horse is the tool
of<00:04:34.040> the<00:04:34.160> trade<00:04:34.360> we<00:04:35.360> do<00:04:35.480> a<00:04:35.510> lot<00:04:35.720> by<00:04:35.840> horseback

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 
of the trade we do a lot by horseback

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.080 
of the trade we do a lot by horseback
when<00:04:36.500> we<00:04:36.860> have<00:04:36.950> to<00:04:37.040> treat<00:04:37.250> an<00:04:37.370> animal<00:04:37.520> in<00:04:38.000> the

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
when we have to treat an animal in the

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.180 
when we have to treat an animal in the
field<00:04:38.360> if<00:04:38.660> it<00:04:38.810> is<00:04:39.410> sick<00:04:39.680> and<00:04:39.800> we<00:04:39.860> have<00:04:40.010> to<00:04:40.100> give

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
field if it is sick and we have to give

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.840 
field if it is sick and we have to give
it<00:04:40.280> some<00:04:40.310> medicine

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
it some medicine

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.580 
it some medicine
we'll<00:04:41.300> use<00:04:41.330> horses<00:04:41.690> and<00:04:41.900> we<00:04:41.960> will<00:04:42.110> use<00:04:42.290> rope

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
we'll use horses and we will use rope

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:44.710 
we'll use horses and we will use rope
ropes<00:04:43.040> we'll<00:04:43.250> rope<00:04:43.430> rope<00:04:43.760> the<00:04:43.940> cattle<00:04:44.240> and<00:04:44.420> to

ropes we'll rope rope the cattle and to

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.310 
ropes we'll rope rope the cattle and to
give<00:04:45.170> them<00:04:45.320> their<00:04:45.440> treatment<00:04:47.080> some<00:04:48.080> people

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
give them their treatment some people
