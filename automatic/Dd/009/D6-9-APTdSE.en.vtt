00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.610
 ah 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.900
 let's meet steam 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.230
 we will need a very useful element like 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:18.539
 the tie you want 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.680
 to use in the 3- liter pot 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.680
 with normal cover 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:29.460
 in this case we are going to use a kilogram of 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.460
 Mussels and a knife 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:35.500
 to start the dish the first thing that 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.780
 we will have to do will be to add water 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:42.100
 indicated are about 300 milliliters of water 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.750
 at the base of the pot 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:48.190
 trying as long as it does not exceed 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.190
 level of society 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:02.820
 next we will put the mussels 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.820
 in the hosts 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.950
 and on top of that we will put the knife 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.660
 how the cooking times are 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.659
 different 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.880
 we will do a first programming 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.100
 4 minutes 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.750
 and later we will leave the 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.750
 Mussels two minutes more 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:53.350
 we will cover the pot again , we will leave it 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.350
 two minutes and the Mexicans will already be
