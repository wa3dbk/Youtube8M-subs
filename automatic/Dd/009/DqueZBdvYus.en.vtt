00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.959
 Google's one of the largest companies 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.250
 in the world 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.200
 he makes people as easy as possible 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.599
 in the field of computers and 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.340
 information and that is why we 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.380
 come up with a new concept 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.849
 google shoes when designing the 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.800
 Google shoes your well thought about 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.080
 appearance and mother sporty shoe 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.760
 its my technical side the lace 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.590
 sits on the top of the shoe 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.689
 so that you as a user are so good 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.369
 can close but at the bottom of one 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.109
 shoe has a thick sole 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.179
 but technology is incorporated and 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.560
 where feyenoord comes walking we are up 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.480
 this idea came 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.550
 because there are so many separate accessories and 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.800
 smartphones are your environment and 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.540
 have bulging pocket 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.100
 and the google shoe is the solution 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.230
 therefor 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.820
 yep shoes always on and there 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.379
 everything you need for the shoe 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.870
 we have a new operating system 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.910
 written so that you as a user there 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.530
 make optimum use of it 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.270
 for example if you are twice on the 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.460
 ground stand and share the shoe your 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.370
 location with all google plus 4 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.359

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.500
 but on 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.899
 Google shoes are fully integrated 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.339
 so they always know with google maps 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.659

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.030
