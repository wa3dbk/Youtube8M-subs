is about a centimeter here and then

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.190 
is about a centimeter here and then
because<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.400> rolling<00:01:14.760> didn't<00:01:15.060> work<00:01:15.240> at<00:01:15.450> the

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
because the rolling didn't work at the

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.429 
because the rolling didn't work at the
beginning<00:01:16.590> I<00:01:16.740> started<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.790> cut<00:01:18.090> with<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.900> saw

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.640 
beginning I started to cut with the saw
I<00:01:19.470> started<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.070> cut<00:01:20.340> this<00:01:20.580> inner<00:01:20.939> fender<00:01:21.390> on

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
I started to cut this inner fender on

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.039 
I started to cut this inner fender on
those<00:01:22.650> areas<00:01:23.009> here<00:01:23.549> there<00:01:24.509> was<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.869> biggest

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
those areas here there was the biggest

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.429 
those areas here there was the biggest
mistake<00:01:25.290> I<00:01:25.830> was<00:01:26.549> hoping<00:01:27.119> that<00:01:27.360> it<00:01:27.840> was<00:01:27.990> would

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
mistake I was hoping that it was would

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.770 
mistake I was hoping that it was would
be<00:01:28.619> easier<00:01:29.100> than<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.640> take<00:01:29.820> pliers<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.600> to

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
be easier than to take pliers and to

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.530 
be easier than to take pliers and to
kind<00:01:30.990> of<00:01:31.079> like<00:01:31.259> bend<00:01:32.009> it<00:01:32.250> towards<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.270> inner

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
kind of like bend it towards the inner

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.640 
kind of like bend it towards the inner
wall<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.430> that<00:01:35.430> didn't<00:01:35.759> work<00:01:35.939> at<00:01:36.119> all<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:37.049> then

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
wall and that didn't work at all so then

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.249 
wall and that didn't work at all so then
and<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.820> still<00:01:38.850> looked<00:01:39.390> good<00:01:39.509> at<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:39.990> time

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
and it still looked good at that time

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.760 
and it still looked good at that time
but<00:01:41.009> then<00:01:41.340> what<00:01:41.640> I<00:01:41.670> did<00:01:42.030> afterwards<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:43.259> took<00:01:43.380> a

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
but then what I did afterwards I took a

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.219

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.220 
same here too I will cut out the fender
that<00:03:44.970> it<00:03:45.209> looks<00:03:45.390> a<00:03:45.480> little<00:03:45.600> bit<00:03:45.750> more<00:03:45.930> round

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
that it looks a little bit more round

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.180 
that it looks a little bit more round
not<00:03:46.769> so<00:03:46.920> straight<00:03:47.310> as<00:03:47.900> it<00:03:48.900> is<00:03:49.049> with<00:03:49.590> the<00:03:49.829> 92

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
not so straight as it is with the 92

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.670 
not so straight as it is with the 92
eight<00:03:50.390> don't<00:03:51.390> liked<00:03:51.600> it<00:03:51.810> Letty's<00:03:52.260> aren't<00:03:52.530> much
