concern in terms of traveling it's the

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.129 
concern in terms of traveling it's the
standing<00:04:34.800> water<00:04:35.240> and<00:04:36.240> maybe<00:04:36.510> a<00:04:36.600> few<00:04:36.720> slick

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 
standing water and maybe a few slick

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
spots on bridges so for travel Wednesday

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.610

morning<00:04:39.449> why<00:04:39.600> the<00:04:39.660> whole<00:04:39.930> mess<00:04:40.199> is<00:04:40.350> kind<00:04:40.530> of

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
morning why the whole mess is kind of

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:41.900 
morning why the whole mess is kind of
out<00:04:40.740> of<00:04:40.770> here<00:04:41.100> and<00:04:41.190> I<00:04:41.250> don't<00:04:41.400> think<00:04:41.490> the<00:04:41.639> snow

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
out of here and I don't think the snow

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.100 
out of here and I don't think the snow
is<00:04:42.090> going<00:04:42.210> to<00:04:42.300> be<00:04:42.419> enough<00:04:42.630> to<00:04:42.720> cause<00:04:42.900> any

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
is going to be enough to cause any

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.230 
is going to be enough to cause any
problems<00:04:43.530> just<00:04:43.590> remember<00:04:44.100> any<00:04:44.280> standing

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
problems just remember any standing

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.170 
problems just remember any standing
water<00:04:45.889> could<00:04:46.889> maybe<00:04:47.070> you<00:04:47.550> know<00:04:47.580> generate<00:04:48.150> a

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
water could maybe you know generate a

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.270 
water could maybe you know generate a
few<00:04:48.389> icy<00:04:48.750> spots<00:04:49.080> just<00:04:49.410> be<00:04:49.620> aware<00:04:49.710> of<00:04:49.889> that

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.610 

let's<00:04:53.280> take<00:04:53.460> a<00:04:53.520> look<00:04:53.760> at<00:04:53.910> the<00:04:54.180> gfs<00:04:54.990> it's<00:04:55.290> a<00:04:55.380> tad

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
let's take a look at the gfs it's a tad

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.800 
let's take a look at the gfs it's a tad
slower<00:04:56.130> this<00:04:56.430> is<00:04:56.639> six<00:04:57.120> o'clock<00:04:57.210> Wednesday

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810 
slower this is six o'clock Wednesday

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.210 
slower this is six o'clock Wednesday
morning<00:04:58.110> it's<00:04:58.229> still<00:04:58.410> showing<00:04:58.590> some<00:04:58.740> snow

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
morning it's still showing some snow

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.240 
morning it's still showing some snow
over<00:05:00.030> a<00:05:00.060> pretty<00:05:00.270> good<00:05:00.450> chunk<00:05:00.630> of<00:05:00.780> the<00:05:00.870> state

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
over a pretty good chunk of the state

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.340 
over a pretty good chunk of the state
like<00:05:02.250> snow<00:05:02.630> but<00:05:03.630> I<00:05:03.660> think<00:05:03.780> the<00:05:03.960> name<00:05:04.169> is

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
like snow but I think the name is

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:05.960 
like snow but I think the name is
probably<00:05:04.770> correct<00:05:05.070> it's<00:05:05.430> been<00:05:05.610> much<00:05:05.790> better

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
probably correct it's been much better

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:07.670 
probably correct it's been much better
with<00:05:06.180> the<00:05:06.240> timing<00:05:06.630> of<00:05:06.690> this<00:05:06.780> thing<00:05:07.020> so<00:05:07.229> far<00:05:07.440> and

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
with the timing of this thing so far and

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.560 
with the timing of this thing so far and
clearly<00:05:08.669> going<00:05:08.970> up<00:05:09.150> the<00:05:09.240> eastern<00:05:09.510> seaboard

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
clearly going up the eastern seaboard

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.340 
clearly going up the eastern seaboard
that's<00:05:10.200> a<00:05:10.350> mess<00:05:11.150> let's<00:05:12.150> look<00:05:12.300> at<00:05:12.450> noon<00:05:12.900> on

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.350 
that's a mess let's look at noon on

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.190 
that's a mess let's look at noon on
Wednesday<00:05:14.040> and<00:05:14.340> again<00:05:14.580> this<00:05:14.760> is<00:05:15.360> the<00:05:15.780> busiest

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 
Wednesday and again this is the busiest

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:18.640 
Wednesday and again this is the busiest
