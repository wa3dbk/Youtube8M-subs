right now i'm doing a lot of parkour and
then<00:02:22.709> servers<00:02:23.220> and<00:02:23.550> maps<00:02:23.819> and<00:02:24.269> it<00:02:24.690> might<00:02:24.989> get<00:02:25.110> a

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
then servers and maps and it might get a

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.839 
then servers and maps and it might get a
little<00:02:25.349> boring<00:02:25.650> i<00:02:25.830> can<00:02:26.010> see<00:02:26.160> how<00:02:26.280> it<00:02:26.310> would<00:02:26.580> Oh

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
little boring i can see how it would Oh

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.240 
little boring i can see how it would Oh
was<00:02:27.629> there<00:02:27.780> no<00:02:27.989> one<00:02:28.170> on<00:02:28.290> this<00:02:28.470> island<00:02:28.739> I<00:02:29.069> don't

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.640 
was there no one on this island I don't
guess<00:02:29.790> so<00:02:30.120> maybe<00:02:30.510> that's<00:02:30.870> kind<00:02:31.050> of<00:02:31.170> weird<00:02:31.349> that

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
guess so maybe that's kind of weird that

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.220 
guess so maybe that's kind of weird that
these<00:02:31.890> weren't<00:02:32.160> taken<00:02:32.580> cuz<00:02:32.790> there<00:02:33.150> was<00:02:33.230> there
