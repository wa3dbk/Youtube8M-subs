00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
start right at this corner but I'm gonna

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.279 
start right at this corner but I'm gonna
make<00:00:27.000> it<00:00:27.180> about<00:00:28.099> this<00:00:29.099> width<00:00:29.510> here<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.750> here

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
make it about this width here and here

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.569 
make it about this width here and here
and<00:00:31.920> we<00:00:32.040> want<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.309> keep<00:00:32.460> this<00:00:34.399> diameter<00:00:35.399> if<00:00:35.489> you

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
and we want to keep this diameter if you

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:35.959 
and we want to keep this diameter if you
will

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
will

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.790 
will

that<00:00:51.040> stops<00:00:51.460> there<00:00:53.460> so<00:00:54.460> when<00:00:54.730> you<00:00:54.880> get<00:00:55.090> to<00:00:55.270> your

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
that stops there so when you get to your

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
first crossover point decide if it's

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.030 
first crossover point decide if it's
going<00:00:59.620> to<00:00:59.860> go<00:01:00.010> over<00:01:00.460> or<00:01:00.820> under<00:01:00.850> I<00:01:01.650> am<00:01:02.650> gonna<00:01:02.830> go

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
going to go over or under I am gonna go

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:19.500 
going to go over or under I am gonna go
over<00:01:06.330> that<00:01:07.330> goes<00:01:07.570> over<00:01:09.870> goes<00:01:10.870> over

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:30.030 

yeah

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.060 

the<00:01:30.490> next<00:01:30.790> one's<00:01:30.970> going<00:01:31.300> to<00:01:31.390> go<00:01:31.890> under<00:01:32.890> here

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
the next one's going to go under here

00:01:33.070 --> 00:02:14.650 
the next one's going to go under here
and<00:01:33.280> then<00:01:33.340> over<00:01:33.760> here

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.790 

all<00:02:15.200> right

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
all right

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:25.420 
all right
this<00:02:17.370> one's<00:02:17.610> gonna<00:02:17.730> continue<00:02:19.100> under<00:02:20.100> and<00:02:20.310> over

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:54.290 

and<00:02:25.819> this<00:02:26.209> one<00:02:26.420> will<00:02:26.569> go

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:22.860 

then<00:02:55.300> under

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.550 

when<00:03:23.590> you<00:03:23.709> draw<00:03:24.150> you<00:03:25.150> tend<00:03:25.450> to<00:03:25.630> get<00:03:25.810> into<00:03:26.200> a

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
when you draw you tend to get into a

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:33.140 
when you draw you tend to get into a
zone<00:03:27.510> it's<00:03:28.510> almost<00:03:28.690> like<00:03:28.870> a<00:03:28.900> meditative<00:03:29.319> date

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.390 

where<00:03:34.150> you<00:03:34.180> become<00:03:34.510> obsessed<00:03:34.660> with<00:03:35.400> making

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
where you become obsessed with making

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.390 
where you become obsessed with making
sure<00:03:36.550> that<00:03:36.910> your<00:03:37.030> drawing<00:03:37.330> is<00:03:37.860> as<00:03:38.860> close<00:03:39.220> to

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
sure that your drawing is as close to

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:50.710 
sure that your drawing is as close to
perfect<00:03:39.640> as<00:03:39.880> possible

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.150 

one<00:03:51.720> of<00:03:51.810> the<00:03:51.870> best<00:03:52.080> ways<00:03:52.260> to<00:03:52.410> draw<00:03:52.620> a<00:03:52.650> curve<00:03:52.920> is

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
one of the best ways to draw a curve is

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:59.260 
one of the best ways to draw a curve is
actually<00:03:53.610> to<00:03:55.280> try<00:03:56.280> and<00:03:56.610> do<00:03:56.820> it<00:03:56.970> in<00:03:57.180> one

00:03:59.260 --> 00:03:59.270 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:05.780 

practiced<00:04:02.450> line<00:04:03.450> rather<00:04:03.960> than<00:04:04.640> continuing<00:04:05.640> it

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
practiced line rather than continuing it

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.030 
practiced line rather than continuing it
it<00:04:06.720> just<00:04:06.900> looks<00:04:07.140> a<00:04:07.200> little<00:04:07.230> smoother<00:04:07.800> when<00:04:07.950> you

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
it just looks a little smoother when you

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.460 
it just looks a little smoother when you
do<00:04:08.130> it<00:04:08.250> that<00:04:08.400> way<00:04:08.550> so<00:04:09.330> this<00:04:09.420> one's<00:04:09.630> over<00:04:09.900> under

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
do it that way so this one's over under

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:27.260 
do it that way so this one's over under
over<00:04:15.799> and<00:04:16.799> this<00:04:16.920> one<00:04:16.980> is<00:04:17.340> on<00:04:17.519> there

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:53.100 

and<00:04:27.810> this<00:04:27.990> one's<00:04:28.199> under<00:04:29.090> and<00:04:30.090> then<00:04:30.419> over

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:57.200 

if<00:04:53.560> you<00:04:53.680> make<00:04:53.860> your<00:04:53.979> line<00:04:54.190> a<00:04:54.220> little<00:04:54.550> too

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.909 

doubled<00:04:58.210> remember<00:04:58.960> that<00:04:59.229> you<00:04:59.319> can<00:04:59.500> always<00:04:59.650> go

00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 
doubled remember that you can always go

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:04.680 
doubled remember that you can always go
back<00:04:59.949> and<00:05:00.400> change<00:05:00.610> it<00:05:01.800> by<00:05:02.800> doing<00:05:02.860> this<00:05:03.539> on<00:05:04.539> a

back and change it by doing this on a
photocopier<00:05:05.530> and<00:05:06.330> reversing<00:05:07.330> the<00:05:07.449> image<00:05:09.000> one

photocopier and reversing the image one

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.899 
photocopier and reversing the image one
of<00:05:10.120> the<00:05:10.180> little<00:05:10.419> tricks<00:05:10.599> I've<00:05:10.930> found<00:05:11.879> sort<00:05:12.879> of

00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:12.909 
of the little tricks I've found sort of

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:22.920 
of the little tricks I've found sort of
a<00:05:13.000> secret<00:05:13.240> with<00:05:15.509> design<00:05:19.409> not<00:05:20.409> doing<00:05:21.569> cyber<00:05:22.569> say

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
a secret with design not doing cyber say

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.869 
a secret with design not doing cyber say
but<00:05:23.729> marketing<00:05:24.729> design<00:05:26.639> alright<00:05:27.639> so<00:05:27.789> this
