00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.630
 hello I am christian solmecke 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.429
 lawyer and partner of the cologne 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.059
 law firm wilde beuger &amp; 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.290
 Solmecke 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.420
 and today there are those again 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.300
 Sunday users ask and me 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.150
 would like to ask a question from janney bau 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.660
 start to be interested in whether 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.190
 to imitate web page designs 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.570
 can 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.800
 Now my question i want my page 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.060
 Of course, not everyone looks the same 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.530
 let but a bit 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.730
 have a change and then watch me 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.280
 like to visit other sites 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.640
 bit the design from now on always 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.350
 your page as an example, I should be pure 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.030
 Theoretically, the design side 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.040
 rebuild as well 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.440
 So, speak up here 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.100
 white div container puremache underneath 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.950
 one as navigation with the blue one 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.440
 history with css3 makes your company 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.760
 cation, therefore, I should be one to me 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.829
 copy one 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.940
 I copy nothing but that 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.800
 means I do not go in your source code 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.439
 recopied as or copy which 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.470
 graphic I do everything myself it is 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.080
 then I can never do that 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.479
 you also say that designs are natural 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.479
 copyrighted are possible 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.320
 It is through quite trivial websites too 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.650
 copy 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.060
 where in fact the whole of baukÃ¤sten 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.490
 but maybe it has been created 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.920
 whenever it is in the creative 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.020
 area goes in then that works 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.610
 not there in the copyright of the 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.740
 so-called protection of the small minster 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.979
 that is the smallest sign of 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.190
 Creativity is protected so there must be 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.860
 be careful with very simple ones 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.630
 websites that you can copy but 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.369
 it will not get any more complicated and now 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:49.860
 one more question from the pug man 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:51.659
 Please , my last question goes 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.290
 it's the copyright of youtube 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.900
 videos 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.110
 yes they use the videos under 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:01.200
 their posts will be posted again 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.090
 in your user questions videos and now 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.860
 My question is how far you are at all 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.520
 the permission to have these videos too 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.569
 use 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.240
 yes it is okay so you too 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:13.180
 conclude it simply 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.340
 can get in if the users see 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.860
 how the videos are used and in 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.850
 post a video question in this context 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.790
 in the video 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.050
 then everyone knows that these videos 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.240
 used again in our videos 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.970
 and that is called konkludent 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.130
 we have agreement here 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.590
 after all, the agreement of the 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.560
 users and beyond, I say 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.420
 Of course, always synonymous in the videos turns 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.540
 us inquire so we can put you back in 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.390
 can use the videos from us and 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.240
 Last ask again a question with 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.550
 many likes of osas video he or she 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.770
 I would like to be anonymous on the internet 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.900
 and still would like to make videos 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.450
 but i also need an imprint like 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.100
 I say difficult to start in the situation 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.800
 you can really want to take it 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.380
 must grow to the artist names the 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.760
 add rent 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.390
 There is something like that and then you are anonymous 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.040
 largely anonymous though 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.700
 traceable but first of all 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.130
 anonymous 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.260
 would have a phone number at think 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:17.380
 because of the boss over ip society kate 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.730
 to attach and a contact address 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.580
 google clearly one can as far as possible 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.750
 Anonymous then you have an effective 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.000
 imprint if you are a decent 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.980
 has also chosen a pseudonym 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.500
 phone number is still 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.390
 not so readily determinable with 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.550
 further research already but without 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.650
 impressum is not then in any case 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:39.060
 not if you opinion-making videos 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:41.860
 there is always an imprint 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.390
 required i thank you again for 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.830
 all users ask us 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.420
 I hope you have arrived yet 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.170
 much more users are also asking in the 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.150
 following weeks 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:53.130
 For the time being I thank you for watching 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.130
 and bye until next time
