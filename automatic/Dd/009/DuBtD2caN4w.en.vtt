just<00:00:58.949> really<00:00:59.219> really<00:00:59.520> bad<00:00:59.820> what<00:01:00.090> I'll

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
just really really bad what I'll

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
eventually get used to it and this was

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.579 
eventually get used to it and this was
actually<00:01:02.250> my<00:01:02.430> first<00:01:02.520> time<00:01:02.879> gunning<00:01:03.559> so<00:01:04.559> I

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
actually my first time gunning so I

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.950 
actually my first time gunning so I
didn't<00:01:05.010> know<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.549> they<00:01:05.939> implemented<00:01:06.689> the

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
didn't know that they implemented the

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.219 
didn't know that they implemented the
new<00:01:06.990> thing<00:01:07.650> in<00:01:07.830> where<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.310> don't<00:01:09.299> have<00:01:09.450> ammo

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
new thing in where you don't have ammo

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.039 
new thing in where you don't have ammo
all<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.619> time<00:01:11.030> in<00:01:12.030> battlefield<00:01:12.630> 3<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:12.900> could

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
all the time in battlefield 3 you could

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.230 
all the time in battlefield 3 you could
have<00:01:13.170> pretty<00:01:13.409> much<00:01:13.470> unlimited<00:01:13.920> ammo<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.700> just

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
have pretty much unlimited ammo I just

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.850 
have pretty much unlimited ammo I just
had<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.420> wait<00:01:15.600> on<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.810> reloads<00:01:16.200> in<00:01:16.470> between

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
had to wait on the reloads in between

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.609 
had to wait on the reloads in between
but<00:01:17.790> in<00:01:17.880> this<00:01:17.970> game<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.689> actually<00:01:18.960> takes<00:01:19.500> a

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
but in this game you it actually takes a

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.100 
but in this game you it actually takes a
while<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:20.040> region<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.610> ammo<00:01:20.939> I'm<00:01:21.479> not<00:01:21.750> sure<00:01:21.990> if

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
while to region the ammo I'm not sure if

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.640 
while to region the ammo I'm not sure if
it<00:01:22.229> regions<00:01:22.619> faster<00:01:23.130> if<00:01:23.220> you<00:01:23.340> have<00:01:23.549> like<00:01:23.850> a

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
it regions faster if you have like a

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.010 
it regions faster if you have like a
more<00:01:25.650> ammo<00:01:25.860> saved<00:01:26.280> up<00:01:26.520> or<00:01:27.270> I'm<00:01:27.689> not<00:01:27.869> sure

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
more ammo saved up or I'm not sure

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.770 
more ammo saved up or I'm not sure
exactly<00:01:28.470> how<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:28.890> works<00:01:29.100> but<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:30.420> can<00:01:30.570> see

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
exactly how it works but I you can see

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.020 
exactly how it works but I you can see
in<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.259> beginning<00:01:31.560> I<00:01:31.950> sort<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.369> just<00:01:32.430> spam

after the first day i've played probably

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.559 
after the first day i've played probably
about<00:02:35.780> seven<00:02:36.230> hours<00:02:36.319> and<00:02:36.909> the<00:02:37.909> game<00:02:38.090> is<00:02:38.299> I'm

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569

absolutely beautiful I have played on
ultra<00:02:41.329> settings<00:02:41.859> but<00:02:42.859> I<00:02:43.180> turned<00:02:44.180> it<00:02:44.299> back<00:02:44.329> on

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
ultra settings but I turned it back on

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.379 
ultra settings but I turned it back on
to<00:02:44.720> auto<00:02:45.189> and<00:02:46.189> I<00:02:46.459> believe<00:02:46.760> everything's<00:02:47.180> on

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:47.389 
to auto and I believe everything's on

high<00:02:47.629> and<00:02:47.930> ultra<00:02:48.620> mixed<00:02:48.950> all<00:02:49.069> together<00:02:49.189> I

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
high and ultra mixed all together I

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.119 
high and ultra mixed all together I
don't<00:02:49.669> know<00:02:49.780> it<00:02:50.780> looks<00:02:51.260> fine<00:02:51.439> to<00:02:51.500> me<00:02:51.650> on<00:02:51.859> higher

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:52.129 
don't know it looks fine to me on higher

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:54.670 
don't know it looks fine to me on higher
auto<00:02:52.609> whatever<00:02:53.030> i<00:02:53.120> have<00:02:53.209> it<00:02:53.450> on<00:02:53.540> but<00:02:54.469> the<00:02:54.530> game

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
auto whatever i have it on but the game

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.280 
auto whatever i have it on but the game
does<00:02:54.980> look<00:02:55.250> absolutely<00:02:55.549> amazing<00:02:56.290> especially

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
does look absolutely amazing especially

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.890 
does look absolutely amazing especially
on<00:02:57.680> those<00:02:57.859> levels<00:02:58.340> where<00:02:58.609> the<00:02:58.879> i<00:02:59.419> believe<00:02:59.750> it's

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
on those levels where the i believe it's

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.289 
on those levels where the i believe it's
still<00:02:59.989> some<00:03:00.409> sort<00:03:00.650> of<00:03:00.709> flood<00:03:01.010> level<00:03:01.370> I<00:03:01.609> mean

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
still some sort of flood level I mean

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:03.640 
still some sort of flood level I mean
flood<00:03:02.569> map<00:03:02.810> whatever<00:03:03.169> you<00:03:03.260> want<00:03:03.379> to<00:03:03.439> call<00:03:03.590> it

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
flood map whatever you want to call it

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.250 
flood map whatever you want to call it
it<00:03:03.889> looks<00:03:04.159> really<00:03:04.549> really<00:03:05.239> good<00:03:05.269> it<00:03:05.959> looks<00:03:06.169> a

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
it looks really really good it looks a

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.839 
it looks really really good it looks a
lot<00:03:06.439> better<00:03:06.650> than<00:03:06.950> when<00:03:07.129> it<00:03:07.250> did<00:03:07.430> in<00:03:07.519> the<00:03:07.609> beta

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:07.849 
lot better than when it did in the beta

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:09.580 
lot better than when it did in the beta
and<00:03:08.090> that's<00:03:08.239> that's<00:03:08.510> for<00:03:08.810> obvious<00:03:09.139> reasons<00:03:09.500> I

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
and that's that's for obvious reasons I

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:10.809 
and that's that's for obvious reasons I
mean<00:03:09.709> they<00:03:09.829> didn't<00:03:10.040> want<00:03:10.189> to<00:03:10.250> make<00:03:10.370> the<00:03:10.430> file

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
mean they didn't want to make the file

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:12.640 
mean they didn't want to make the file
size<00:03:11.120> too<00:03:11.419> large<00:03:11.450> so<00:03:11.750> you<00:03:12.260> don't<00:03:12.440> have<00:03:12.530> to

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
size too large so you don't have to

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.949 
size too large so you don't have to
download<00:03:12.829> all<00:03:13.159> that<00:03:13.340> just<00:03:13.549> for<00:03:13.699> beta<00:03:14.030> one

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
download all that just for beta one

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.479 
download all that just for beta one
thing<00:03:15.139> I've<00:03:15.260> noticed<00:03:15.379> is<00:03:15.709> that<00:03:15.769> these<00:03:16.129> snipers

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
thing I've noticed is that these snipers

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.430 
thing I've noticed is that these snipers
feel<00:03:17.030> really<00:03:17.359> powerful<00:03:17.900> in<00:03:18.019> this<00:03:18.169> game<00:03:18.409> I

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
feel really powerful in this game I

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.089 
feel really powerful in this game I
don't<00:03:18.560> know<00:03:18.769> if<00:03:18.859> it's<00:03:18.979> just<00:03:19.159> me<00:03:19.359> my<00:03:20.359> had<00:03:20.540> a<00:03:21.099> well

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:22.099 
don't know if it's just me my had a well

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:23.530 
don't know if it's just me my had a well
I<00:03:22.129> had<00:03:22.310> one<00:03:22.489> game<00:03:22.669> when<00:03:22.790> I<00:03:22.819> was<00:03:22.940> playing<00:03:23.090> rush

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
I had one game when I was playing rush

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.869 
I had one game when I was playing rush
yesterday<00:03:24.500> the<00:03:24.919> first<00:03:25.159> day<00:03:25.370> the<00:03:25.489> game<00:03:25.639> came

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:25.879 
yesterday the first day the game came

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:28.539 
yesterday the first day the game came
out<00:03:26.090> and<00:03:26.389> i<00:03:26.870> think<00:03:27.290> i<00:03:27.379> went<00:03:27.560> on<00:03:27.620> a<00:03:27.650> 20<00:03:28.069> some<00:03:28.280> kill

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
out and i think i went on a 20 some kill

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:31.110 
out and i think i went on a 20 some kill
streak<00:03:28.849> with<00:03:29.030> the<00:03:29.150> m40<00:03:29.720> like<00:03:30.019> close<00:03:30.319> range<00:03:30.709> and

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
streak with the m40 like close range and

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.819 
streak with the m40 like close range and
that's<00:03:32.120> a<00:03:32.209> little<00:03:32.449> ridiculous<00:03:32.829> especially

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
too they died stood I mean the maps they

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.890 
too they died stood I mean the maps they
all<00:04:31.800> look<00:04:32.069> really<00:04:32.310> good<00:04:32.639> but<00:04:32.909> every<00:04:33.389> freakin

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
all look really good but every freakin

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.140 
all look really good but every freakin
map<00:04:34.110> is<00:04:34.379> like<00:04:34.650> 10<00:04:35.159> different<00:04:35.340> layers<00:04:35.819> we<00:04:36.060> have

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
map is like 10 different layers we have

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.140 
map is like 10 different layers we have
a<00:04:36.180> roof<00:04:36.479> we<00:04:36.690> have<00:04:36.810> a<00:04:36.840> mid-level<00:04:37.349> a<00:04:37.680> mid<00:04:38.460> to<00:04:38.699> top

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
a roof we have a mid-level a mid to top

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.499 
a roof we have a mid-level a mid to top
roof<00:04:39.599> level<00:04:39.990> bottom<00:04:40.590> level<00:04:40.979> underground<00:04:41.759> it's

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:42.509 
roof level bottom level underground it's

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:44.149 
roof level bottom level underground it's
like<00:04:42.720> that<00:04:42.930> on<00:04:43.080> every<00:04:43.440> map<00:04:43.620> so<00:04:43.860> it's<00:04:43.979> really

00:04:44.149 --> 00:04:44.159 
like that on every map so it's really

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:45.920 
like that on every map so it's really
difficult<00:04:44.460> like<00:04:45.060> when<00:04:45.270> someone<00:04:45.509> spots

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930 
difficult like when someone spots

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.260 
difficult like when someone spots
somebody<00:04:46.349> and<00:04:46.770> you're<00:04:47.460> like<00:04:47.699> see<00:04:47.970> them<00:04:48.090> on<00:04:48.180> the

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
somebody and you're like see them on the

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.580 
somebody and you're like see them on the
map<00:04:48.330> and<00:04:48.599> you're<00:04:48.720> looking<00:04:49.050> all<00:04:49.139> around<00:04:49.259> you're

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
map and you're looking all around you're

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.619 
map and you're looking all around you're
looking<00:04:49.860> up<00:04:49.979> you're<00:04:50.159> looking<00:04:50.400> down<00:04:50.550> and<00:04:50.909> it's

00:04:51.619 --> 00:04:51.629 
looking up you're looking down and it's

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:52.909 
looking up you're looking down and it's
like<00:04:51.750> you<00:04:51.840> get<00:04:51.960> then<00:04:52.259> you<00:04:52.379> get<00:04:52.500> shot<00:04:52.740> in<00:04:52.860> the

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 
like you get then you get shot in the

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:55.189 
like you get then you get shot in the
back<00:04:53.129> for<00:04:53.370> looking<00:04:53.669> for<00:04:53.819> that<00:04:53.909> person<00:04:54.330> so<00:04:54.569> I

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:55.199 
back for looking for that person so I

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:56.629 
back for looking for that person so I
don't<00:04:55.620> know<00:04:55.680> I<00:04:55.710> guess<00:04:55.800> I<00:04:56.009> have<00:04:56.099> to<00:04:56.190> get<00:04:56.310> used<00:04:56.520> to

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639 
don't know I guess I have to get used to

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:59.809 
don't know I guess I have to get used to
all<00:04:56.699> these<00:04:56.879> different<00:04:57.889> levels<00:04:58.889> I<00:04:59.159> mean<00:04:59.669> it's

00:04:59.809 --> 00:04:59.819 
all these different levels I mean it's

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:01.430 
all these different levels I mean it's
really<00:04:59.909> it's<00:05:00.120> cool<00:05:00.389> new<00:05:00.629> dimension<00:05:01.259> to<00:05:01.289> the

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
really it's cool new dimension to the

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.890 
really it's cool new dimension to the
game<00:05:01.620> I<00:05:01.800> suppose<00:05:02.159> it<00:05:02.460> wasn't<00:05:02.639> too<00:05:03.449> much<00:05:03.659> like

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
game I suppose it wasn't too much like

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.439 
game I suppose it wasn't too much like
that<00:05:04.110> in<00:05:04.289> battlefield<00:05:04.800> 3<00:05:05.120> but<00:05:06.120> like<00:05:06.270> I<00:05:06.389> said

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:06.449 
that in battlefield 3 but like I said

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:09.230 
that in battlefield 3 but like I said
it'll<00:05:06.810> be<00:05:06.960> really<00:05:07.110> cool<00:05:07.379> to<00:05:07.440> get<00:05:07.830> used<00:05:08.039> to<00:05:08.250> but

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
it'll be really cool to get used to but
