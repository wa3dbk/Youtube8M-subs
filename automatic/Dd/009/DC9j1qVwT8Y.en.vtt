00:00:03.224 --> 00:00:06.000
I majored in biomedical engineering. 

00:00:06.224 --> 00:00:09.224
And research in biomedical engineering

00:00:09.324 --> 00:00:13.224
is conducted here at BECS.

00:00:13.625 --> 00:00:16.125
There was this MEG-MRI research project 

00:00:16.625 --> 00:00:19.125
which sounded interesting.

00:00:19.625 --> 00:00:26.625
Some of my hobbies were beneficial to the research, so the choice was natural.

00:00:27.549 --> 00:00:33.549
We have this hybrid brain imaging method which combines two different procedures.

00:00:34.141 --> 00:00:39.641
One method focuses on structural brain imaging, the other on functional brain imaging.

00:00:40.377 --> 00:00:52.877
With the hybrid devise we can put these together, to improve accuracy, and to include both methods in one single instrument.

00:00:54.373 --> 00:00:57.373
What is essential in research group work?

00:00:58.347 --> 00:01:02.447
We do a lot together, and think together about what is the best way to proceed. 

00:01:02.814 --> 00:01:08.814
Different people specialize on different things based on their interests and strengths. 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
And end up doing slightly different tasks.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:28.940
The work can range from technical construction, even sawing and hammering two by fours, to deep theoretical work. 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:37.370
We do calculations with pen and paper, then on the other hand, we use computers in various tasks, like in computer programming.  

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.200
Then there is also signal processing etc. 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.700
What courses would you recommend?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
First and second year math and physics.

00:01:48.125 --> 00:02:04.120
We put them in good use here. Even if sometimes, at the time of study, they would not seem to answer any specific questions.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Then there are courses in biomedical engineering. 

00:02:09.533 --> 00:02:18.530
The structure and function of the human brain, and related courses, are good ones to attend. 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:30.720
And if you take additional electronics courses, for example, even they will come handy.

00:02:33.036 --> 00:02:46.040
A few months ago I went to a neuroscience conference that was held in New Orleans. And I made this poster for that occasion. 

00:02:47.705 --> 00:02:56.000
People from all over the world came to tell me that they had heard about MEG-MRI, and asked how the project was doing.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.380
I told them that the first images have now come out, and this is how it looks.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:08.800
People were really interested and excited. They asked: 
- When can we get one of these?
