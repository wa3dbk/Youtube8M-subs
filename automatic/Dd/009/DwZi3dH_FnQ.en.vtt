let's go back to the catalog open up one

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.569 
let's go back to the catalog open up one
of<00:03:29.569> the<00:03:29.690> parts<00:03:30.019> and<00:03:30.260> actually<00:03:30.919> go<00:03:31.250> through<00:03:31.430> the

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:31.579 
of the parts and actually go through the

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:32.890 
of the parts and actually go through the
process<00:03:31.970> that<00:03:32.000> an<00:03:32.209> engineer<00:03:32.540> might<00:03:32.750> go

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
through to download this part so we've

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.599 
through to download this part so we've
brought<00:03:36.079> the<00:03:36.290> product<00:03:36.500> to<00:03:36.680> the<00:03:36.769> screen<00:03:37.099> we've

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:37.609 
brought the product to the screen we've

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:39.159 
brought the product to the screen we've
configured<00:03:37.940> it<00:03:38.239> with<00:03:38.599> exactly<00:03:39.019> the

then<00:03:41.060> we<00:03:41.239> want<00:03:41.389> to<00:03:41.480> be<00:03:41.780> able<00:03:41.840> to<00:03:41.959> receive<00:03:42.410> that

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
then we want to be able to receive that

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.369 
then we want to be able to receive that
model<00:03:43.099> on<00:03:43.449> our<00:03:44.449> computer<00:03:44.900> so<00:03:45.049> that<00:03:45.079> we<00:03:45.260> can

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:45.379 
model on our computer so that we can

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:47.259 
model on our computer so that we can
integrate<00:03:45.560> it<00:03:45.829> into<00:03:46.010> our<00:03:46.250> CAD<00:03:46.459> application<00:03:47.090> in
