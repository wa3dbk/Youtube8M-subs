 video title I put 8 tips the

 reason is that this video the fact of 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.400
 joint way with thin desirée a 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.410
 youtuber that has a magnificent channel 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.289
 dedicated to digital photography photography 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.359
 and blogs for it in your channel you have the 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.520
 4 tips remaining in the description 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:35.500
 I'm going to leave the link to your video for 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.780
 that you can know the other 4 tips 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.940
 without further delay I go with the first 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.920
 Advice accessories that can be 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.870
 useful on a trip the first of them 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.030
 is the famous stick type is the end you 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.890
 you can buy from about nine euros and 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.109
 you can even do it yourself 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.730
 for about three euros on my channel you have 

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:54.070
 a tutorial in which I explain how 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.960
 make what this stick allows you to record 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.390
 you to yourself without using the arm and also 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.489
 that gives more stability to the videos 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.079
 if you are going to use the car it is very 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:03.879
 interesting that you carry this kind of 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.100
 suction cups that allow you to place the 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.510
 camera on the front moon to grab 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.000
 all the way that we are traveling 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.550
 this tripod takes up very little space 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.110
 It has a ridiculous price and gives you a 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.630
 wide range of exhibitions 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.400
 to place the camera in still shots this 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.020
 Support is necessary to be able to place 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.600
 the camera in the three accessories that you 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.210
 I have taught now if you have a sj 4000 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.560
 or sj 5000 is one of the accessories that 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.380
 they come next to the camera when the 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.270
 We obviously bought the housing 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.370
 Water is imperative to record 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.770
 under the water or place the camera in 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.750
 the accessories the harness for the chest is 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.220
 frankly useful not to lose any 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.500
 detail when we go for a 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.690
 city ​​or when we go by motorcycle or bike 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.970
 and the last accessory that I find very 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.530
 useful is a power van with her you're going to 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.900
 can increase the duration of the 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.060
 battery exponentially advice number 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.040
 2 uses the functions of your channel 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.780
 normally this type of cameras come 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.000
 equipped with extra features aside 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.860
 of the video and the simple photo the two 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.509
 extra functions to which more parties 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.790
 we are going to be able to take them out are the time 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.100
 lapse and the photos in burst mode the 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.080
 timelapse consists of continuous taking 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.090
 of photos in time intervals with 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.560
 this we managed to portray the course 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.390
 of an action that usually lasts a lot 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.220
 time in a few seconds by 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.200
 example I have taken pictures every five 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.390
 seconds while eating then the 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.040
 put together in video format and the result 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.560
 is the one you are seeing now 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.359
 the photos in burst mode are really 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.010
 interesting when we want to capture the 

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:29.650
 image of an action that takes place very 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.510
 fast for example if we want to have a 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.909
 Our photo jumping will be difficult 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.920
 shoot at an opportune time but with 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:38.079
 the burst mode we will have all the 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.849
 sequence of the action in photos and let's 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:41.680
 to have the right moment stored 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.689
 the memory of our council chamber 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.760
 number 3 takes advantage of the size of your 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:47.230
 camera to place it in cool places 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.209
 it is one of the main 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.680
 characteristics of these cameras is that 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.900
 They are of a pretty size and weight 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.609
 reduced what allows us to put them in 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.590
 places that a reflection a camera of 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:58.569
 common video could not be placed 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.669
 Under the car are usually images 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.349
 pretty cool or in the hollow of some 

00:03:00.669 --> 00:03:06.540
 shelf to capture some jump 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:06.540
 slow motion monster on top of your bed 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.239
 body number advice or do not stay 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.800
 never without battery in the first council 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.349
 I told you that a power band is 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.390
 frankly useful and this is specifically 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:20.580
 the one that I show you now is the power band 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.220
 Yao Ming is 10,400 milliamps 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.200
 will allow us to record almost 18 hours 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.030
 uninterruptedly if we plug it in 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.040
 our camera so that the feed from 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.050
 electricity is ideal when we go to 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.090
 mount and we will not have a plug to 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:35.190
 hand or if we want to do a timelapse of 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.720
 several hours these have been my four 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.580
 tips remember that you have others 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.500
 four tips waiting for you in the video

 some of the accessories that I have 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:45.030
 commented on the video I leave in the
