00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.670 

I've<00:00:07.029> copied<00:00:07.420> this<00:00:07.690> program<00:00:08.290> from<00:00:08.620> the

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:08.680 
I've copied this program from the

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.980 
I've copied this program from the
article<00:00:09.340> and<00:00:09.520> this<00:00:10.030> will<00:00:10.240> allow<00:00:10.480> us<00:00:10.510> to<00:00:10.719> play

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:10.990 
article and this will allow us to play

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:17.339 
article and this will allow us to play
one<00:00:11.170> sequence<00:00:11.679> at<00:00:11.830> a<00:00:11.920> time<00:00:15.750> you'll<00:00:16.750> see<00:00:16.840> here

00:00:17.339 --> 00:00:17.349 
one sequence at a time you'll see here

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:19.440 
one sequence at a time you'll see here
that<00:00:17.380> we<00:00:17.650> can<00:00:17.680> change<00:00:18.310> the<00:00:18.610> sequence<00:00:18.820> number

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:19.450 
that we can change the sequence number

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.080 
that we can change the sequence number
with<00:00:20.050> key<00:00:20.380> hits<00:00:20.650> when<00:00:20.920> I<00:00:20.949> press<00:00:21.220> the<00:00:21.460> one<00:00:22.060> key

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.090 
with key hits when I press the one key

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.810 
with key hits when I press the one key
the<00:00:22.600> sequence<00:00:22.990> will<00:00:23.170> be<00:00:23.350> one<00:00:23.560> and<00:00:23.830> likewise

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:24.820 
the sequence will be one and likewise

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.730 
the sequence will be one and likewise
with<00:00:25.090> the<00:00:25.119> two<00:00:25.900> and<00:00:26.080> three<00:00:26.320> keys<00:00:26.529> on<00:00:26.710> the

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:26.740 
with the two and three keys on the

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.900 
with the two and three keys on the
keyboard<00:00:26.980> and<00:00:28.260> then<00:00:29.260> here<00:00:29.590> we<00:00:29.619> just<00:00:29.890> see<00:00:30.220> that

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:30.910 
keyboard and then here we just see that

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.900 
keyboard and then here we just see that
it's<00:00:31.559> looking<00:00:32.559> at<00:00:32.739> what<00:00:33.040> the<00:00:33.070> sequence<00:00:33.550> value

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
it's looking at what the sequence value

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.780 
it's looking at what the sequence value
is<00:00:34.120> if<00:00:34.440> it's<00:00:35.440> one<00:00:35.710> then<00:00:35.979> the<00:00:36.129> first<00:00:36.339> frame<00:00:36.610> is

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:36.790 
is if it's one then the first frame is

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.640 
is if it's one then the first frame is
zero<00:00:37.089> and<00:00:37.330> the<00:00:38.309> last<00:00:39.309> frame<00:00:39.610> is<00:00:39.820> 69<00:00:40.449> if<00:00:40.930> it's<00:00:41.440> to

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:41.650 
zero and the last frame is 69 if it's to

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.460 
zero and the last frame is 69 if it's to
the<00:00:41.860> first<00:00:42.129> frame<00:00:42.339> is<00:00:42.610> 70<00:00:43.089> and<00:00:43.299> the<00:00:43.870> last<00:00:44.199> frame

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.470 
the first frame is 70 and the last frame

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.180 
the first frame is 70 and the last frame
is<00:00:44.650> 70<00:00:45.129> or<00:00:45.339> 130<00:00:46.210> and<00:00:46.479> if<00:00:47.440> the<00:00:47.589> sequence<00:00:47.890> is

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:48.190 
is 70 or 130 and if the sequence is

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.780 
is 70 or 130 and if the sequence is
three<00:00:48.580> the<00:00:49.089> first<00:00:49.690> frame<00:00:50.019> is<00:00:50.229> 131<00:00:50.799> and<00:00:51.250> the

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:51.790 
three the first frame is 131 and the

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.899 
three the first frame is 131 and the
last<00:00:52.000> frame<00:00:52.299> is<00:00:52.540> 171<00:00:53.350> and<00:00:53.589> I<00:00:54.460> know<00:00:54.640> this

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:54.909 
last frame is 171 and I know this

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:57.450 
last frame is 171 and I know this
because<00:00:55.180> the<00:00:55.570> person<00:00:55.750> who<00:00:56.199> created<00:00:57.159> who

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
because the person who created who

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.689 
because the person who created who
animated<00:00:57.820> this<00:00:58.150> mash<00:00:58.390> told<00:00:58.780> me<00:00:58.900> those<00:00:59.080> numbers

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.620 

down<00:01:03.699> here<00:01:04.030> we're<00:01:04.409> using<00:01:05.409> the<00:01:05.799> app<00:01:05.950> time<00:01:06.250> /<00:01:06.820> 100

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
down here we're using the app time / 100

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.440 
down here we're using the app time / 100
for<00:01:08.470> the<00:01:08.500> frame<00:01:08.800> value<00:01:10.830> but<00:01:11.830> then<00:01:12.010> we're

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
for the frame value but then we're

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.070 
for the frame value but then we're
modulating<00:01:13.450> the<00:01:13.620> frame<00:01:14.620> by<00:01:15.010> the<00:01:15.840> by<00:01:16.840> this

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
modulating the frame by the by this

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.980 
modulating the frame by the by this
which<00:01:17.320> is<00:01:17.500> the<00:01:17.860> last<00:01:18.250> frame<00:01:18.550> minus<00:01:19.330> the<00:01:19.750> first

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
which is the last frame minus the first

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.280 
which is the last frame minus the first
frame<00:01:20.350> which<00:01:21.310> equals<00:01:22.090> the<00:01:22.480> length<00:01:22.810> of<00:01:23.110> the

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
frame which equals the length of the

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.520 
frame which equals the length of the
frame<00:01:23.560> the<00:01:24.400> length<00:01:24.610> of<00:01:24.730> the<00:01:24.850> sequence<00:01:25.170> so<00:01:26.170> when

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
frame the length of the sequence so when

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.420 
frame the length of the sequence so when
we<00:01:26.650> call<00:01:26.890> this<00:01:27.040> f<00:01:27.280> mod<00:01:27.580> f<00:01:27.790> function<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:29.710> divides

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
we call this f mod f function it divides

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.110 
we call this f mod f function it divides
this<00:01:31.390> frame<00:01:31.780> value<00:01:32.260> by<00:01:32.920> the<00:01:32.980> length<00:01:33.550> of<00:01:33.820> the

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 
this frame value by the length of the

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.000 
this frame value by the length of the
frame<00:01:34.390> of<00:01:34.659> the<00:01:34.720> sequence<00:01:35.380> until<00:01:36.060> this<00:01:37.060> is<00:01:37.420> a

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.010 
frame of the sequence until this is a

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.060 
frame of the sequence until this is a
value<00:01:39.010> between<00:01:39.159> 0<00:01:39.760> and<00:01:40.090> this<00:01:40.480> value<00:01:40.770> it's<00:01:41.770> like

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
value between 0 and this value it's like

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:48.810 
value between 0 and this value it's like
if<00:01:42.340> you<00:01:43.290> if<00:01:44.290> the<00:01:45.070> time<00:01:45.310> is<00:01:45.450> 345<00:01:46.450> p.m.<00:01:47.050> and<00:01:47.820> you

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
if you if the time is 345 p.m. and you

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.310 
if you if the time is 345 p.m. and you
want<00:01:49.000> to<00:01:49.060> find<00:01:49.240> out<00:01:49.420> how<00:01:49.570> many<00:01:49.630> minutes<00:01:49.930> there

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
want to find out how many minutes there

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.320 
want to find out how many minutes there
are<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:52.060> just<00:01:52.330> the<00:01:52.750> minutes<00:01:53.200> value<00:01:53.590> is<00:01:53.740> 45<00:01:54.370> you

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
are you just the minutes value is 45 you

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.040 
are you just the minutes value is 45 you
just<00:01:55.620> divide<00:01:56.620> the<00:01:56.800> hours<00:01:57.100> by<00:01:57.310> 60<00:01:57.820> until<00:01:58.420> the

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
just divide the hours by 60 until the

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.149 
just divide the hours by 60 until the
value<00:01:59.380> you<00:01:59.770> have<00:01:59.950> is<00:02:00.190> less<00:02:00.430> than<00:02:00.670> 60<00:02:01.120> and<00:02:02.159> then

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
value you have is less than 60 and then

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.480 
value you have is less than 60 and then
at<00:02:03.490> the<00:02:03.700> end<00:02:03.820> we<00:02:04.060> add<00:02:04.299> this<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.920> first<00:02:06.159> frame

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
at the end we add this the first frame

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.779 
at the end we add this the first frame
here<00:02:06.790> and<00:02:06.970> if<00:02:07.450> this<00:02:07.630> isn't<00:02:07.990> clear<00:02:08.319> then<00:02:08.789> it's

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
here and if this isn't clear then it's

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.760 
here and if this isn't clear then it's
explained<00:02:10.239> better<00:02:10.450> in<00:02:10.659> the<00:02:10.780> article<00:02:11.200> and<00:02:11.379> I

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
explained better in the article and I

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.699 
explained better in the article and I
recommend<00:02:12.190> you<00:02:12.250> take<00:02:12.430> a<00:02:12.459> look<00:02:12.610> at<00:02:12.760> that<00:02:12.790> and

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
recommend you take a look at that and

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:31.290 
recommend you take a look at that and
then<00:02:14.709> we<00:02:14.830> just<00:02:14.860> animate<00:02:15.550> it<00:02:15.700> like<00:02:16.060> normal

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.660 

so<00:02:31.960> right<00:02:32.140> now<00:02:32.170> explain<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:32.710> idol<00:02:33.250> sequence

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
so right now explain the idol sequence

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.100 
so right now explain the idol sequence
in<00:02:33.820> a<00:02:33.910> loop<00:02:34.090> and<00:02:34.300> I'll<00:02:34.870> press<00:02:35.080> the<00:02:35.230> two<00:02:35.440> key<00:02:35.710> and

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
in a loop and I'll press the two key and

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:43.400 
in a loop and I'll press the two key and
now<00:02:38.110> it's<00:02:38.290> playing<00:02:38.440> the<00:02:38.680> walk<00:02:38.860> sequence<00:02:40.920> and

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
now it's playing the walk sequence and

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.510 
now it's playing the walk sequence and
you'll<00:02:44.410> notice<00:02:44.650> it's<00:02:44.950> playing<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.340> same

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
you'll notice it's playing the same

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.970 
you'll notice it's playing the same
frames<00:02:45.880> over<00:02:46.240> and<00:02:46.360> over<00:02:46.480> again<00:02:46.690> but<00:02:47.560> you<00:02:47.740> can't

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
frames over and over again but you can't

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.280 
frames over and over again but you can't
see<00:02:48.250> any<00:02:48.430> transition<00:02:49.240> when<00:02:49.570> it<00:02:49.600> loops<00:02:49.930> and

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
see any transition when it loops and

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:58.200 
see any transition when it loops and
it's<00:02:50.440> perfectly<00:02:50.830> smooth<00:02:54.360> and<00:02:56.820> the<00:02:57.820> same<00:02:58.000> thing

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.210 
it's perfectly smooth and the same thing

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:06.660 
it's perfectly smooth and the same thing
goes<00:02:58.390> for<00:02:58.420> the<00:02:58.660> running<00:02:58.870> animation<00:03:05.670> I've

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
goes for the running animation I've

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.640 
goes for the running animation I've
copied<00:03:07.000> this<00:03:07.240> program<00:03:07.690> from<00:03:07.900> the<00:03:07.960> article<00:03:08.470> and

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
copied this program from the article and

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.620 
copied this program from the article and
this<00:03:09.280> will<00:03:09.460> demonstrate<00:03:09.730> how<00:03:09.970> we<00:03:10.120> can<00:03:10.390> use

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 
this will demonstrate how we can use

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.630 
this will demonstrate how we can use
animation<00:03:11.350> blending<00:03:11.980> to<00:03:12.220> smoothly

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
animation blending to smoothly

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:19.200 
animation blending to smoothly
transition<00:03:12.820> between<00:03:13.720> two<00:03:13.990> sequences<00:03:18.210> now

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:19.210 
transition between two sequences now

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.890 
transition between two sequences now
like<00:03:19.390> before<00:03:19.840> I<00:03:20.080> have<00:03:20.890> the<00:03:21.750> keyboard<00:03:22.750> input

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
like before I have the keyboard input

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.050 
like before I have the keyboard input
set<00:03:23.350> up<00:03:23.530> to<00:03:23.770> affect<00:03:24.310> the<00:03:24.430> sequence<00:03:24.880> that's

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
set up to affect the sequence that's

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.830 
set up to affect the sequence that's
being<00:03:25.330> played<00:03:26.370> but<00:03:27.370> I<00:03:27.430> have<00:03:27.640> this<00:03:27.850> blend<00:03:28.420> value

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
being played but I have this blend value

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.420 
being played but I have this blend value
here<00:03:29.140> and<00:03:31.200> this<00:03:32.200> says<00:03:32.560> that<00:03:32.860> if<00:03:32.980> the<00:03:33.100> sequence

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
here and this says that if the sequence

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.050 
here and this says that if the sequence
equals<00:03:33.970> to<00:03:34.860> the<00:03:35.860> blend<00:03:36.160> value<00:03:36.580> will<00:03:36.850> keep

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
equals to the blend value will keep

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.900 
equals to the blend value will keep
getting<00:03:37.480> just<00:03:38.260> a<00:03:38.380> little<00:03:38.410> value<00:03:39.250> subtracted

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
getting just a little value subtracted

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.510 
getting just a little value subtracted
from<00:03:39.940> that<00:03:40.239> each<00:03:40.390> frame<00:03:40.750> and<00:03:41.070> if<00:03:42.070> the<00:03:42.190> sequence

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:42.520 
from that each frame and if the sequence

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.520 
from that each frame and if the sequence
is<00:03:42.820> three<00:03:43.239> the<00:03:43.600> blend<00:03:43.840> value<00:03:44.200> will<00:03:44.380> get<00:03:44.500> a

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
is three the blend value will get a

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.850 
is three the blend value will get a
little<00:03:44.830> bit<00:03:45.070> added<00:03:45.459> to<00:03:45.610> it<00:03:45.730> each<00:03:45.940> frame<00:03:46.390> and

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:46.860 
little bit added to it each frame and

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.560 
little bit added to it each frame and
then<00:03:47.860> here<00:03:48.190> we<00:03:48.220> just<00:03:48.459> clamped<00:03:48.940> the<00:03:49.120> blend

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
then here we just clamped the blend

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.810 
then here we just clamped the blend
value<00:03:49.959> so<00:03:50.110> that<00:03:50.200> it's<00:03:50.410> always<00:03:50.709> between<00:03:51.100> 0<00:03:51.220> and

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
value so that it's always between 0 and

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.940 
value so that it's always between 0 and
1<00:03:52.470> and<00:03:54.480> now<00:03:55.480> I'm<00:03:55.630> going<00:03:55.900> to<00:03:56.050> blend<00:03:56.500> these<00:03:56.709> two

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
1 and now I'm going to blend these two

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.390 
1 and now I'm going to blend these two
different<00:03:57.100> sequences<00:03:58.200> with<00:03:59.200> the<00:03:59.560> blend<00:04:00.010> value

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
different sequences with the blend value

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.240 
different sequences with the blend value
so<00:04:01.209> the<00:04:01.330> first<00:04:01.540> thing<00:04:01.630> I'm<00:04:01.840> going<00:04:01.989> to<00:04:02.110> do<00:04:02.290> is<00:04:02.500> to

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
so the first thing I'm going to do is to

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.270 
so the first thing I'm going to do is to
play<00:04:03.459> the<00:04:03.730> walk<00:04:04.209> sequence<00:04:04.840> and<00:04:05.140> I'm<00:04:05.980> going<00:04:06.190> to

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
play the walk sequence and I'm going to

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.260 
play the walk sequence and I'm going to
use<00:04:06.489> a<00:04:07.830> blend<00:04:08.830> value<00:04:09.190> of<00:04:09.310> one<00:04:09.580> because<00:04:09.940> I<00:04:10.060> want

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270 
use a blend value of one because I want

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.990 
use a blend value of one because I want
this<00:04:10.420> to<00:04:10.480> have<00:04:11.320> a<00:04:11.610> 100-percent<00:04:12.610> effect<00:04:13.060> and

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
this to have a 100-percent effect and

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.800 
this to have a 100-percent effect and
then<00:04:16.000> after<00:04:16.480> I've<00:04:16.919> set<00:04:17.919> the<00:04:18.160> walk<00:04:18.820> frame<00:04:19.239> I'm

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:19.810 
then after I've set the walk frame I'm

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.350 
then after I've set the walk frame I'm
also<00:04:20.530> going<00:04:20.890> to<00:04:20.980> animate<00:04:21.340> the<00:04:21.700> mesh<00:04:21.970> with<00:04:22.330> the

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
also going to animate the mesh with the

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.820 
also going to animate the mesh with the
run<00:04:22.810> frame<00:04:23.169> with<00:04:23.800> the<00:04:23.919> run<00:04:24.100> sequence<00:04:24.460> and<00:04:25.830> for

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
run frame with the run sequence and for

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.070 
run frame with the run sequence and for
the<00:04:26.890> blend<00:04:27.160> value<00:04:27.580> I'm<00:04:27.790> going<00:04:28.570> to<00:04:28.660> use<00:04:28.840> this

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
the blend value I'm going to use this

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.900 
the blend value I'm going to use this
blending<00:04:30.040> value<00:04:30.370> that<00:04:30.550> we<00:04:30.640> talked<00:04:30.880> about<00:04:32.910> so

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
blending value that we talked about so

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.880 
blending value that we talked about so
first<00:04:34.180> we're<00:04:34.450> playing<00:04:34.690> the<00:04:34.960> walk<00:04:35.290> sequence

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:35.890 
first we're playing the walk sequence

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.970 
first we're playing the walk sequence
and<00:04:36.540> now<00:04:37.540> we'll<00:04:37.690> have<00:04:37.870> just<00:04:38.200> a<00:04:38.290> complete<00:04:38.650> one

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980 
and now we'll have just a complete one

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.350 
and now we'll have just a complete one
hundred<00:04:39.250> percent<00:04:39.280> of<00:04:39.640> fact<00:04:39.820> like<00:04:40.090> it<00:04:40.240> did

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
hundred percent of fact like it did

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.140 
hundred percent of fact like it did
before<00:04:40.510> and<00:04:41.370> then<00:04:42.370> we're<00:04:42.520> going<00:04:42.669> to<00:04:42.820> play<00:04:43.000> the

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
before and then we're going to play the

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.700 
before and then we're going to play the
run<00:04:43.360> sequence<00:04:43.720> on<00:04:44.080> top<00:04:44.380> of<00:04:44.530> the

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
run sequence on top of the

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.690 
run sequence on top of the
and<00:04:45.750> if<00:04:46.750> the<00:04:46.960> blend<00:04:47.230> value<00:04:47.650> when<00:04:48.280> we<00:04:48.400> play<00:04:48.580> the

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
and if the blend value when we play the

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.750 
and if the blend value when we play the
run<00:04:48.880> sequence<00:04:49.210> is<00:04:49.570> 1<00:04:49.870> then<00:04:50.830> we'll<00:04:51.340> just<00:04:51.580> see

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
run sequence is 1 then we'll just see

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.210 
run sequence is 1 then we'll just see
the<00:04:51.910> normal<00:04:52.270> run<00:04:52.660> sequence<00:04:53.080> completely<00:04:53.920> with

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
the normal run sequence completely with

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.930 
the normal run sequence completely with
a<00:04:54.520> full<00:04:55.330> effect<00:04:55.660> if<00:04:55.960> the<00:04:56.590> blend<00:04:56.830> value<00:04:57.160> is<00:04:57.370> 0

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
a full effect if the blend value is 0

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.660 
a full effect if the blend value is 0
then<00:04:58.870> we<00:04:59.200> won't<00:04:59.440> see<00:04:59.710> any<00:04:59.920> effect<00:05:00.220> of<00:05:00.400> the<00:05:00.490> run

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.670 
then we won't see any effect of the run

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.760 
then we won't see any effect of the run
sequence<00:05:01.000> at<00:05:01.360> all<00:05:01.540> and<00:05:01.840> if<00:05:02.350> it's<00:05:02.500> somewhere

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
sequence at all and if it's somewhere

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.920 
sequence at all and if it's somewhere
between<00:05:02.830> then<00:05:03.670> we'll<00:05:03.910> see<00:05:04.150> a<00:05:04.180> mixture<00:05:04.660> of

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
between then we'll see a mixture of

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:15.340 
between then we'll see a mixture of
walking<00:05:05.740> and<00:05:05.920> running

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.350 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.590 

so<00:05:16.350> here<00:05:16.590> he<00:05:16.710> is<00:05:16.740> walking<00:05:17.130> and<00:05:17.490> I'm<00:05:18.330> going<00:05:18.570> to

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 
so here he is walking and I'm going to

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.960 
so here he is walking and I'm going to
press<00:05:18.840> the<00:05:19.050> two<00:05:19.230> key<00:05:19.470> which<00:05:19.890> will<00:05:19.920> make<00:05:20.760> him

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:20.970 
press the two key which will make him

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:28.670 
press the two key which will make him
transition<00:05:21.420> into<00:05:21.750> the<00:05:21.960> run<00:05:22.110> sequence<00:05:27.170> and<00:05:28.170> you

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
transition into the run sequence and you

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.310 
transition into the run sequence and you
can<00:05:28.800> see<00:05:28.980> now<00:05:29.190> he's<00:05:29.460> running<00:05:29.730> and<00:05:30.060> if<00:05:30.960> I<00:05:31.110> press

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
can see now he's running and if I press

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.560 
can see now he's running and if I press
the<00:05:31.470> one<00:05:31.650> key<00:05:31.680> again<00:05:32.190> he'll<00:05:32.700> transition<00:05:33.360> back

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:33.570 
the one key again he'll transition back

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:37.790 
the one key again he'll transition back
into<00:05:33.600> the<00:05:34.170> wok<00:05:34.410> sequence<00:05:34.920> and<00:05:36.500> it's<00:05:37.500> a<00:05:37.590> nice

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
into the wok sequence and it's a nice

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.500 
into the wok sequence and it's a nice
smooth<00:05:38.160> transition<00:05:38.880> that<00:05:39.060> looks<00:05:39.270> very

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.510 
smooth transition that looks very

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:58.740 
smooth transition that looks very
natural

00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:58.750 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.660 

now<00:05:59.350> there's<00:05:59.560> one<00:05:59.680> more<00:05:59.740> technique<00:06:00.130> i<00:06:00.430> want<00:06:00.610> to

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:00.670 
now there's one more technique i want to

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:04.310 
now there's one more technique i want to
show<00:06:00.850> you<00:06:00.880> and<00:06:01.150> that's<00:06:01.750> split<00:06:02.230> animation

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:04.320 
show you and that's split animation

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.390 
show you and that's split animation
you'll<00:06:05.320> remember<00:06:05.590> that<00:06:05.740> I<00:06:05.860> said<00:06:05.920> we<00:06:06.250> can

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:06.400 
you'll remember that I said we can

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.930 
you'll remember that I said we can
animate<00:06:07.150> any<00:06:07.420> entity<00:06:08.050> in<00:06:08.200> the<00:06:08.290> hierarchy

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940 
animate any entity in the hierarchy

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:13.020 
animate any entity in the hierarchy
recursively<00:06:10.860> so<00:06:11.860> here<00:06:12.040> I'm<00:06:12.160> going<00:06:12.370> to<00:06:12.550> find

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:13.030 
recursively so here I'm going to find

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.360 
recursively so here I'm going to find
this<00:06:13.240> base<00:06:13.720> of<00:06:13.930> the<00:06:14.050> spine<00:06:14.170> bone<00:06:14.770> and<00:06:15.100> I'll

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:15.370 
this base of the spine bone and I'll

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:20.420 
this base of the spine bone and I'll
just<00:06:15.550> call<00:06:15.700> that<00:06:15.880> spine<00:06:16.300> and<00:06:18.810> during<00:06:19.810> the<00:06:19.900> loop

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:20.430 
just call that spine and during the loop

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:23.070 
just call that spine and during the loop
first<00:06:21.430> I'm<00:06:21.670> going<00:06:21.880> to<00:06:21.970> animate<00:06:22.600> the<00:06:22.870> whole

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:23.080 
first I'm going to animate the whole

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:27.360 
first I'm going to animate the whole
mesh<00:06:23.380> with<00:06:23.710> the<00:06:23.740> walk<00:06:24.040> sequence<00:06:24.610> and<00:06:26.220> then<00:06:27.220> I'm

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:27.370 
mesh with the walk sequence and then I'm

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.610 
mesh with the walk sequence and then I'm
going<00:06:27.610> to<00:06:27.670> animate<00:06:28.000> only<00:06:28.750> the<00:06:28.930> spine<00:06:29.260> bone

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:29.620 
going to animate only the spine bone

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:34.140 
going to animate only the spine bone
recursively<00:06:30.570> so<00:06:31.570> this<00:06:32.290> will<00:06:32.560> animate<00:06:33.520> the

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:34.150 
recursively so this will animate the

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:36.330 
recursively so this will animate the
spine<00:06:34.840> and<00:06:34.870> all<00:06:35.320> its<00:06:35.470> children<00:06:35.560> so<00:06:36.100> it<00:06:36.250> will

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:36.340 
spine and all its children so it will

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.000 
spine and all its children so it will
animate<00:06:36.790> the<00:06:37.000> whole<00:06:37.150> upper<00:06:37.390> body<00:06:37.740> with<00:06:38.740> the

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:39.010 
animate the whole upper body with the

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:41.550 
animate the whole upper body with the
run<00:06:39.340> sequence<00:06:39.730> and<00:06:40.090> you'll<00:06:40.900> notice<00:06:41.200> here<00:06:41.410> i'm

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:41.560 
run sequence and you'll notice here i'm

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.310 
run sequence and you'll notice here i'm
dividing<00:06:42.100> app<00:06:42.310> time<00:06:42.790> by<00:06:43.060> only<00:06:43.419> 50<00:06:43.840> so<00:06:44.140> it's

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:44.320 
dividing app time by only 50 so it's

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.560 
dividing app time by only 50 so it's
going<00:06:44.470> to<00:06:44.560> be<00:06:44.680> a<00:06:44.710> little<00:06:44.860> bit<00:06:45.010> faster<00:06:45.390> so<00:06:46.390> let's

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:46.570 
going to be a little bit faster so let's

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:58.210 
going to be a little bit faster so let's
see<00:06:46.720> what<00:06:46.750> that<00:06:46.960> does

00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:58.220 

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:00.800 

so<00:06:59.220> you<00:06:59.340> can<00:06:59.580> see<00:06:59.760> our<00:06:59.790> character<00:07:00.390> here<00:07:00.660> is

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:00.810 
so you can see our character here is

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:03.100 
so you can see our character here is
dancing<00:07:01.470> around<00:07:01.590> and<00:07:01.890> having<00:07:02.040> a<00:07:02.190> good<00:07:02.340> time<00:07:02.610> a

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:03.110 
dancing around and having a good time a

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:05.540 
dancing around and having a good time a
more<00:07:04.110> practical<00:07:04.350> application<00:07:05.250> for<00:07:05.460> this

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:05.550 
more practical application for this

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:08.840 
more practical application for this
might<00:07:05.850> be<00:07:06.030> to<00:07:06.450> play<00:07:06.990> a<00:07:07.130> walking<00:07:08.130> sequence<00:07:08.610> for

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:08.850 
might be to play a walking sequence for

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:11.300 
might be to play a walking sequence for
the<00:07:08.880> lower<00:07:09.330> body<00:07:09.630> and<00:07:09.870> then<00:07:10.560> you<00:07:10.800> can<00:07:10.950> make<00:07:11.130> the

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:11.310 
the lower body and then you can make the

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:14.180 
the lower body and then you can make the
upper<00:07:11.730> body<00:07:11.940> shoot<00:07:12.630> a<00:07:12.720> gun<00:07:12.930> or<00:07:13.290> swing<00:07:13.890> a<00:07:14.010> sword

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:14.190 
upper body shoot a gun or swing a sword

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:17.510 
upper body shoot a gun or swing a sword
or<00:07:14.460> do<00:07:15.000> something<00:07:15.210> like<00:07:15.450> that
