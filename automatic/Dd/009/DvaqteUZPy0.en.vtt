00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.060 

I'm<00:00:07.339> going<00:00:07.520> to<00:00:07.609> start<00:00:07.850> with<00:00:08.149> a<00:00:08.389> grooving<00:00:08.809> tool

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:09.070 
I'm going to start with a grooving tool

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.280 
I'm going to start with a grooving tool
it's<00:00:10.070> got<00:00:10.280> a<00:00:10.309> nice<00:00:11.120> flat<00:00:11.420> surface<00:00:11.930> here<00:00:11.959> I'm

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:12.290 
it's got a nice flat surface here I'm

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.289 
it's got a nice flat surface here I'm
going<00:00:12.440> to<00:00:12.530> take<00:00:12.709> that<00:00:12.889> flat<00:00:13.160> surface<00:00:13.430> and<00:00:13.910> I'm

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:14.299 
going to take that flat surface and I'm

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:16.630 
going to take that flat surface and I'm
going<00:00:14.480> to<00:00:14.539> run<00:00:14.750> it<00:00:14.900> at<00:00:15.139> 45-degree<00:00:16.039> angle<00:00:16.610> just

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:16.640 
going to run it at 45-degree angle just

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.060 
going to run it at 45-degree angle just
right<00:00:16.910> across<00:00:17.150> the<00:00:17.539> edges<00:00:17.869> to<00:00:18.350> knock<00:00:18.560> off<00:00:18.859> any

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:19.070 
right across the edges to knock off any

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:28.930 
right across the edges to knock off any
excess<00:00:19.609> wax<00:00:27.010> we'll<00:00:28.010> do<00:00:28.160> it<00:00:28.280> on<00:00:28.430> the<00:00:28.460> same<00:00:28.730> on

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:28.940 
excess wax we'll do it on the same on

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:36.430 
excess wax we'll do it on the same on
this<00:00:29.090> side<00:00:33.430> and<00:00:34.719> then<00:00:35.719> we're<00:00:35.899> going<00:00:36.020> to<00:00:36.140> remove

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
this side and then we're going to remove

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.340 
this side and then we're going to remove
the<00:00:36.710> wax<00:00:36.860> in<00:00:37.190> the<00:00:37.309> groove<00:00:38.019> so<00:00:39.019> that's<00:00:39.140> going<00:00:39.260> to

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
the wax in the groove so that's going to

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.520 
the wax in the groove so that's going to
be<00:00:39.440> a<00:00:39.469> nice<00:00:40.239> easy<00:00:41.239> movement<00:00:41.870> this<00:00:41.989> way<00:00:42.199> it's

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
be a nice easy movement this way it's

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:43.899 
be a nice easy movement this way it's
better<00:00:42.769> to<00:00:43.010> do<00:00:43.190> a<00:00:43.219> number<00:00:43.609> of<00:00:43.760> different

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:43.909 
better to do a number of different

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:47.079 
better to do a number of different
passes<00:00:44.780> that<00:00:45.050> are<00:00:45.199> lighter<00:00:45.699> rather<00:00:46.699> than<00:00:46.940> one

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:47.089 
passes that are lighter rather than one

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:48.939 
passes that are lighter rather than one
heavy<00:00:47.390> pass<00:00:47.839> where<00:00:48.199> you<00:00:48.350> can<00:00:48.530> potentially

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:48.949 
heavy pass where you can potentially

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:53.219 
heavy pass where you can potentially
damage<00:00:49.219> your<00:00:49.460> skis<00:00:51.100> what<00:00:52.100> I've<00:00:52.219> got<00:00:52.399> our<00:00:52.699> two

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:53.229 
damage your skis what I've got our two

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:55.629 
damage your skis what I've got our two
plexiglass<00:00:54.229> scrapers<00:00:54.829> one<00:00:55.190> is<00:00:55.309> a<00:00:55.339> five

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:55.639 
plexiglass scrapers one is a five

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:57.639 
plexiglass scrapers one is a five
millimeter<00:00:55.909> scraper<00:00:56.719> the<00:00:57.170> other<00:00:57.289> one<00:00:57.499> is<00:00:57.620> a

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
millimeter scraper the other one is a

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:00.069 
millimeter scraper the other one is a
thinner<00:00:58.100> three<00:00:58.489> millimeter<00:00:58.969> the<00:00:59.719> three

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
thinner three millimeter the three

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:01.750 
thinner three millimeter the three
millimeter<00:01:00.559> you<00:01:00.799> can<00:01:00.949> actually<00:01:01.129> flex<00:01:01.609> a

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
millimeter you can actually flex a

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.700 
millimeter you can actually flex a
little<00:01:01.999> bit<00:01:02.179> I'm<00:01:03.049> going<00:01:03.199> to<00:01:03.260> start<00:01:03.499> with<00:01:03.679> a

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
little bit I'm going to start with a

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:05.920 
little bit I'm going to start with a
five<00:01:03.979> millimeter<00:01:04.220> and<00:01:04.699> I've<00:01:05.299> just<00:01:05.449> sharpened

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
five millimeter and I've just sharpened

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.890 
five millimeter and I've just sharpened
my<00:01:06.490> plexiglass<00:01:07.490> scraper<00:01:07.909> and<00:01:08.210> what's

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:08.900 
my plexiglass scraper and what's

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.200 
my plexiglass scraper and what's
important<00:01:09.380> is<00:01:09.530> that<00:01:09.579> you<00:01:10.579> want<00:01:10.880> to<00:01:10.969> scrape

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
important is that you want to scrape

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.499 
important is that you want to scrape
with<00:01:11.509> sharp<00:01:11.840> scrapers<00:01:12.430> the<00:01:13.430> reason<00:01:13.820> being<00:01:14.030> is

00:01:14.499 --> 00:01:14.509 
with sharp scrapers the reason being is

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:16.569 
with sharp scrapers the reason being is
if<00:01:14.689> you're<00:01:14.899> working<00:01:15.439> with<00:01:15.649> a<00:01:15.770> dull<00:01:16.039> scrape<00:01:16.369> or

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:16.579 
if you're working with a dull scrape or

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:18.130 
if you're working with a dull scrape or
you're<00:01:16.670> gonna<00:01:16.759> have<00:01:17.030> to<00:01:17.180> push<00:01:17.420> down<00:01:17.659> harder

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
you're gonna have to push down harder

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.800 
you're gonna have to push down harder
and<00:01:18.399> as<00:01:19.399> I<00:01:19.579> mentioned<00:01:19.969> with<00:01:20.119> the<00:01:20.149> groove<00:01:20.450> you

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
and as I mentioned with the groove you

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.330 
and as I mentioned with the groove you
have<00:01:20.960> the<00:01:21.079> potential<00:01:21.439> of<00:01:21.680> doing<00:01:21.740> damage<00:01:22.159> to

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
have the potential of doing damage to

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.109 
have the potential of doing damage to
your<00:01:22.490> ski<00:01:22.880> by<00:01:23.180> skidding<00:01:23.630> off<00:01:23.799> the<00:01:24.799> ski<00:01:25.100> and<00:01:25.460> you

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
your ski by skidding off the ski and you

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.870 
your ski by skidding off the ski and you
also<00:01:26.619> have<00:01:27.619> the<00:01:27.740> potential<00:01:28.100> of<00:01:28.549> actually

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
also have the potential of actually

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.209 
also have the potential of actually
flattening<00:01:29.689> and/or<00:01:30.020> ruining<00:01:30.530> your<00:01:30.680> structure

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:31.219 
flattening and/or ruining your structure

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:34.179 
flattening and/or ruining your structure
by<00:01:31.369> pushing<00:01:31.640> down<00:01:31.820> too<00:01:32.270> hard<00:01:32.409> you<00:01:33.409> can<00:01:33.560> even<00:01:33.920> if

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
by pushing down too hard you can even if

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:36.039 
by pushing down too hard you can even if
your<00:01:34.340> scraper<00:01:34.880> is<00:01:35.000> sharp<00:01:35.329> and<00:01:35.600> you're<00:01:35.719> pushing

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
your scraper is sharp and you're pushing

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:37.240 
your scraper is sharp and you're pushing
down<00:01:36.200> hard<00:01:36.439> you<00:01:36.500> can<00:01:36.740> actually<00:01:36.890> take<00:01:37.219> your

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
down hard you can actually take your

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.370 
down hard you can actually take your
structure<00:01:37.850> off<00:01:38.030> or<00:01:38.359> at<00:01:38.450> least<00:01:38.630> portions<00:01:39.109> of<00:01:39.229> it

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
structure off or at least portions of it

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.919 
structure off or at least portions of it
off<00:01:39.530> so<00:01:40.310> we<00:01:40.850> want<00:01:41.030> to<00:01:41.090> have<00:01:41.149> a<00:01:41.240> sharp<00:01:41.570> scrape

00:01:41.919 --> 00:01:41.929 
off so we want to have a sharp scrape

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:44.590 
off so we want to have a sharp scrape
scraper<00:01:42.619> we<00:01:43.460> want<00:01:43.670> to<00:01:43.759> go<00:01:43.880> nice<00:01:44.149> and<00:01:44.420> light

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
scraper we want to go nice and light

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.529 
scraper we want to go nice and light
it's<00:01:45.049> better<00:01:45.259> to<00:01:45.439> do<00:01:45.619> many<00:01:46.070> light<00:01:46.700> passes<00:01:47.299> than

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:47.539 
it's better to do many light passes than

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:52.480 
it's better to do many light passes than
a<00:01:47.570> few<00:01:47.929> hard<00:01:48.200> ones<00:01:48.469> and<00:01:50.740> you<00:01:51.740> need<00:01:51.920> to<00:01:52.039> know<00:01:52.310> how

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
a few hard ones and you need to know how

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.399 
a few hard ones and you need to know how
to<00:01:52.549> hold<00:01:52.789> it<00:01:52.969> what<00:01:53.240> I<00:01:53.270> like<00:01:53.600> is<00:01:53.929> I<00:01:54.259> basically

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
to hold it what I like is I basically

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:58.389 
to hold it what I like is I basically
hold<00:01:55.070> the<00:01:55.340> scraper<00:01:55.609> like<00:01:55.999> this<00:01:57.100> that<00:01:58.100> way<00:01:58.340> you

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
hold the scraper like this that way you

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:01.569 
hold the scraper like this that way you
don't<00:01:58.999> run<00:01:59.600> the<00:01:59.780> you<00:02:00.140> you<00:02:00.679> eliminate<00:02:01.189> the<00:02:01.340> risk

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
don't run the you you eliminate the risk

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:04.749 
don't run the you you eliminate the risk
of<00:02:01.880> the<00:02:02.719> scraper<00:02:03.140> moving<00:02:03.469> to<00:02:03.619> the<00:02:03.740> side<00:02:04.009> if<00:02:04.369> it

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
of the scraper moving to the side if it

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:06.849 
of the scraper moving to the side if it
moves<00:02:04.999> to<00:02:05.210> the<00:02:05.329> side<00:02:05.600> like<00:02:05.929> this<00:02:06.140> that's<00:02:06.590> when

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:06.859 
moves to the side like this that's when

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:09.700 
moves to the side like this that's when
you<00:02:06.890> can<00:02:07.159> cut<00:02:07.429> and<00:02:07.640> damage<00:02:08.330> your<00:02:08.360> ski<00:02:08.810> so<00:02:09.590> we're

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
you can cut and damage your ski so we're

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.130 
you can cut and damage your ski so we're
going<00:02:09.800> to<00:02:09.890> hold<00:02:10.130> it<00:02:10.340> with<00:02:10.520> our<00:02:11.330> index<00:02:11.780> fingers

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
going to hold it with our index fingers
