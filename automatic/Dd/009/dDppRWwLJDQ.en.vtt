00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.120
 Hello my name is Vasily Ulyanov and 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:18.770
 in this video we are with you 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.410
 wish to talk about proper nutrition 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.900
 that allow you to always be in excellent 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.550
 forms here to be full of strength and energy and 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.160
 health and in this video we are with you 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.980
 talk about such a food as 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.960
 water now I will explain why water is 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.020
 the most important point of nutrition which 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:39.950
 should introduce first if 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:44.120
 you haven't done it yet and so let's 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:47.630
 write the sacred word water what are you 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.120
 should know in simple language we are with you 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.699
 is 80 percent water 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.620
 what is important to understand is important to understand 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.559
 that all the cells of your body 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:01.489
 absolutely including the same muscular 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:04.129
 cells they are all made of water here 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.830
 what you need to understand if in your body 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.200
 not enough water if you drink little if 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.990
 you don't support 80 percent 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:17.060
 own body your body works 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:19.310
 at a very low level that is so your 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.010
 efficiency is about can 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.170
 be there 30-40 percent of a hundred 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:29.710
 possible then see let's be 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:35.650
 knit water low howl down arrow 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:39.830
 low speed low speed running 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:42.380
 that is, your business starts to experience 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:45.590
 lethargy fatigue you keep walking 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.770
 you have little power little energy it happens 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.660
 because the cells begin to dry in 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.210
 the body lacks enough water and drink 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:56.090
 and every cell of your body and 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.770
 shrinks and she just survive and even 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.770
 if you start eating right 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.230
 provide themselves with protein and carbohydrates and 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.970
 fat cells are just not capable 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.340
 take a normal amount of food 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.540
 because you feed from society 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.030
 the dead 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.310
 and the longer you don't drink the less water 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.590
 the more cells from and even though you are not 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.660
 can work efficiently ie your 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.420
 the body just work at low speeds 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.760
 and if you want you can 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.920
 effectively addressed in the training 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.870
 so that you have a very long time to 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.950
 the fat burning process took place on 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.290
 full power 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.040
 you first have to tax 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.340
 water intake 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:39.470
 when you start raising water yes here 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:42.020
 separate the water up work speed 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.360
 your body increases well right 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.270
 I would say that dozens of times, that is, you 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.040
 become you run 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.770
 your body at full capacity 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.850
 work on all 100 percent of the cell 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.700
 saturated with water 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.070
 they become full again again 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.780
 become alive and your body starts 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:03.130
 work at maximum speeds 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:08.080
 as far as possible takes place 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:11.290
 speed increase muscle growth 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:14.900
 muscle growth 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:18.020
 increase fat burning rate 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.180
 but these are the main processes that us 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.459
 Water interested want to speed up 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.410
 if you want your full 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.989
 power performed these processes you in 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.370
 first of all must start feeding yourself 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:30.440
 water to your cells 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:32.630
 restore to completely on 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.920
 full power works and itâ€™s important 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:38.930
 what you need to remember 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:41.750
 water for you is yours is your battery 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.540
 this is your energy efficiency source 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.270
 the more water in the body the better 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.960
 She made up for your body to give the 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.120
 effectively 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:53.090
 work but i love to portray it 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:56.240
 so imagine some station 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.490
 dates hydro and 80 percent 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:02.450
 parts but simply not repaired 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:05.930
 somewhere around 10 to 3 the station is already dying 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:08.270
 such fights suddenly come repairmen 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.460
 they are all 80 percent of the parts replaced 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.140
 put new restored and station 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.570
 started working at full capacity such 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:17.060
 there is a sharp increase in efficiency 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:18.830
 she starts to give out more energy 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.410
 more forces the same thing happens 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:25.070
 do when you start drinking water in this 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:27.920
 video i want to tell you a few 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.150
 rules have water too 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.180
 admission rules 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.400
 let's consider them the first rule you 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.290
 must take water immediately 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.210
 after sleep as soon as we woke up 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:41.390
 here we ourselves said that in the morning we 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.920
 must fill your body with food but 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:49.310
 first of all you have to make it up 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:50.950
 water after slade after sleep woke up 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:55.070
 immediately take out 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:59.320
 The following rule is mandatory for 30 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.320
 minutes to eat 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.880
 very important rule that you should 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.680
 remember yourself 30 minutes before 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.170
 every meal you must 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.910
 must drink water because very 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:12.430
 large amount of water is used 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:15.490
 our body's digestion and yes 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:18.640
 no pour water before eating process 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:21.940
 digestion of food is difficult to happen 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:23.980
 much harder and during 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.750
 your body begins to have more water 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:28.360
 suck out of your cages to your 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.730
 food accordingly you are not consuming water 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:34.690
 Acad you carry a very big 

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:38.910
 damage the third rule is sure to drink during 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:38.910
 training time in the gym 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:46.510
 work on sweating 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.790
 be sure to be annoyed and 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:49.180
 water during exercise on black 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:52.060
 the hall 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.610
 this is a mandatory three basic rule 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:56.860
 rules of which you must remember 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:06:01.770
 consume water the rate of water two two with 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:04.810
 half a liter two you will day 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:06.640
 for men with low levels of physical 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:11.700
 activity either not training or on 

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:13.870
 easy training and 3-3 and a half 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:16.560
 gym on muscle growth and so 

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:19.630
 Further, these are the rules and regulations 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:22.110
 Be sure to first implement in 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:24.550
 its britain water intake to 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:26.920
 increase the efficiency of your 

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:28.180
 organism on this I have everything here is 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.400
 here is a small useful video 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:32.710
 use it fly water in 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:36.420
 and your body will work beyond 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:36.420
 effectively this is all for now
