00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
one now feels very polished we did the

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.020 
one now feels very polished we did the
same<00:03:35.989> floating<00:03:36.470> detail<00:03:36.860> that<00:03:37.160> we<00:03:37.280> did<00:03:37.489> at<00:03:37.670> the

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
same floating detail that we did at the

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.479 
same floating detail that we did at the
entryway<00:03:38.660> with<00:03:38.900> the<00:03:39.050> white<00:03:39.230> oak<00:03:39.500> so<00:03:40.130> there's<00:03:40.430> a

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
entryway with the white oak so there's a

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:42.490 
entryway with the white oak so there's a
nice<00:03:40.640> sense<00:03:40.910> of<00:03:41.000> continuity<00:03:41.390> there<00:03:41.750> I<00:03:41.959> put<00:03:42.470> a

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
nice sense of continuity there I put a

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.229 
nice sense of continuity there I put a
drivet<00:03:42.950> sink<00:03:43.190> on<00:03:43.340> top<00:03:43.370> of<00:03:43.730> it<00:03:43.820> so<00:03:43.970> it<00:03:44.060> feels

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
drivet sink on top of it so it feels

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.000 
drivet sink on top of it so it feels
like<00:03:44.450> it's<00:03:44.630> sitting<00:03:44.930> right<00:03:44.959> on<00:03:45.230> top<00:03:45.410> of<00:03:45.440> that<00:03:45.709> I

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
like it's sitting right on top of that I

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.460 
like it's sitting right on top of that I

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
subway tile so there's a nice mix of

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.970 
subway tile so there's a nice mix of
textures<00:03:52.220> on<00:03:52.489> the<00:03:52.519> walls<00:03:52.790> the<00:03:53.570> black<00:03:53.870> hex<00:03:54.709> tile

on the floor it's also heated with new
heat<00:03:56.870> underneath<00:03:57.350> so<00:03:57.560> it<00:03:57.650> feels<00:03:57.800> really<00:03:57.980> warm

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250

for us down there our laundry area is
also<00:05:10.050> downstairs<00:05:10.680> but<00:05:10.920> it's<00:05:11.070> in<00:05:11.160> its<00:05:11.280> own

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
also downstairs but it's in its own

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.250 
also downstairs but it's in its own
dedicated<00:05:11.670> section<00:05:12.390> through<00:05:12.630> a<00:05:12.660> door<00:05:12.900> so<00:05:13.140> it's

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:13.260 
dedicated section through a door so it's

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:15.590 
dedicated section through a door so it's
kept<00:05:13.440> separate<00:05:13.860> it<00:05:14.490> has<00:05:14.730> the<00:05:14.910> same<00:05:15.120> feeling

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 
kept separate it has the same feeling

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.970 
kept separate it has the same feeling
the<00:05:15.720> same<00:05:15.930> tile<00:05:16.200> on<00:05:16.320> the<00:05:16.380> floor<00:05:16.590> that<00:05:16.740> we<00:05:16.830> saw

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:16.980 
the same tile on the floor that we saw

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:18.770 
the same tile on the floor that we saw
in<00:05:17.070> the<00:05:17.160> bathroom<00:05:17.310> the<00:05:17.820> same<00:05:18.030> white<00:05:18.240> paneling

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
in the bathroom the same white paneling

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.430 
in the bathroom the same white paneling
for<00:05:18.810> a<00:05:19.050> nice<00:05:19.290> sense<00:05:19.530> of<00:05:19.680> continuity<00:05:19.980> I<00:05:21.440> think

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
for a nice sense of continuity I think

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.960 
for a nice sense of continuity I think
the<00:05:22.530> biggest<00:05:22.740> thing<00:05:23.040> that<00:05:23.070> we<00:05:23.550> learnt<00:05:23.790> a

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
the biggest thing that we learnt a

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.730 
the biggest thing that we learnt a
reason<00:05:24.360> I<00:05:24.450> from<00:05:24.750> doing<00:05:24.930> this<00:05:25.050> renovation<00:05:25.410> is

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
reason I from doing this renovation is

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.860 
reason I from doing this renovation is
that<00:05:25.980> you<00:05:26.160> don't<00:05:26.520> have<00:05:26.820> to<00:05:27.120> dig<00:05:27.510> down<00:05:27.660> your

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
that you don't have to dig down your

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:28.970 
that you don't have to dig down your
basement<00:05:28.350> when<00:05:28.500> you're<00:05:28.620> doing<00:05:28.800> a<00:05:28.860> renovation

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:28.980 
basement when you're doing a renovation

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.950 
basement when you're doing a renovation
I<00:05:29.520> think<00:05:29.730> a<00:05:29.790> lot<00:05:30.000> of<00:05:30.120> people<00:05:30.360> think<00:05:30.630> that<00:05:30.780> you

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
I think a lot of people think that you

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.050 
I think a lot of people think that you
have<00:05:31.080> to<00:05:31.200> blow<00:05:31.410> a<00:05:31.440> bundle<00:05:31.890> and<00:05:32.130> really<00:05:32.970> go

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
have to blow a bundle and really go

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.730 
have to blow a bundle and really go
through<00:05:33.210> that<00:05:33.390> massive<00:05:33.960> mess<00:05:34.140> of<00:05:34.350> digging<00:05:34.650> it

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
through that massive mess of digging it

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.830 
through that massive mess of digging it
out<00:05:34.830> and<00:05:35.040> getting<00:05:35.340> high<00:05:35.520> ceiling<00:05:35.970> height<00:05:36.120> but

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
out and getting high ceiling height but

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:39.020 
out and getting high ceiling height but
we<00:05:37.080> did<00:05:37.290> not<00:05:37.470> do<00:05:37.710> that<00:05:37.740> we<00:05:38.190> chose<00:05:38.430> to<00:05:38.730> instead

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
we did not do that we chose to instead

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.390 
we did not do that we chose to instead
do<00:05:39.720> some<00:05:40.050> really<00:05:40.260> clever<00:05:40.530> design<00:05:40.920> moves<00:05:41.190> to

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
do some really clever design moves to

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.490 
do some really clever design moves to
hide<00:05:41.610> things<00:05:41.880> like<00:05:42.180> the<00:05:42.330> vents<00:05:42.660> we<00:05:43.080> move<00:05:43.320> the

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
hide things like the vents we move the

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.250 
hide things like the vents we move the
furnace<00:05:43.920> to<00:05:44.190> open<00:05:44.460> things<00:05:44.640> up<00:05:44.940> and<00:05:45.240> we<00:05:46.020> also
