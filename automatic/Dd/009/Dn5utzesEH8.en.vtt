have a walmart mirror in here that I

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.080 
have a walmart mirror in here that I
used<00:03:14.170> to<00:03:14.380> pluck<00:03:14.769> my<00:03:14.920> eyebrows<00:03:15.250> now<00:03:15.489> use<00:03:15.760> this

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
used to pluck my eyebrows now use this

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.360 
used to pluck my eyebrows now use this
because<00:03:16.360> I<00:03:16.630> can<00:03:16.780> get<00:03:16.900> a<00:03:16.930> lot<00:03:17.110> closer<00:03:17.440> and<00:03:17.680> the

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
because I can get a lot closer and the

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.130 
because I can get a lot closer and the
clarity<00:03:18.700> on<00:03:18.940> it<00:03:19.299> I'll<00:03:19.540> know<00:03:19.660> how<00:03:19.810> to<00:03:19.840> explain

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
clarity on it I'll know how to explain

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.080 
clarity on it I'll know how to explain
it<00:03:20.260> but<00:03:20.709> the<00:03:20.830> clarity<00:03:21.280> on<00:03:21.310> this<00:03:21.580> is<00:03:21.790> a<00:03:21.820> lot

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
it but the clarity on this is a lot

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.400 
it but the clarity on this is a lot
better<00:03:22.360> and<00:03:22.690> I'm<00:03:22.780> not<00:03:22.930> just<00:03:23.110> saying<00:03:23.200> that

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
better and I'm not just saying that

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.740 
better and I'm not just saying that
because<00:03:23.500> over<00:03:24.100> it<00:03:24.220> costs<00:03:24.640> a<00:03:24.790> little<00:03:24.910> more<00:03:25.090> but

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
because over it costs a little more but

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.570 
because over it costs a little more but
honestly<00:03:26.320> the<00:03:26.470> clarity<00:03:26.920> is<00:03:26.980> better<00:03:27.250> on<00:03:27.430> this

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
honestly the clarity is better on this

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.660 
honestly the clarity is better on this
and<00:03:27.850> the<00:03:28.380> magnification<00:03:29.380> on<00:03:29.470> on<00:03:29.830> this<00:03:30.250> isn't

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
and the magnification on on this isn't

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.720 
and the magnification on on this isn't
as<00:03:30.850> strong<00:03:31.239> as<00:03:31.630> something<00:03:32.290> like<00:03:32.620> you<00:03:33.400> like<00:03:33.700> you

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
as strong as something like you like you

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.750 
as strong as something like you like you
would<00:03:34.000> bite<00:03:34.209> a<00:03:34.239> piece<00:03:34.570> of<00:03:34.630> plaster<00:03:35.200> or<00:03:35.760> you

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
would bite a piece of plaster or you

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.000 
would bite a piece of plaster or you
know<00:03:36.910> or<00:03:37.090> whatever<00:03:37.330> it<00:03:37.690> but<00:03:38.080> it<00:03:38.290> but<00:03:38.709> the<00:03:38.799> thing

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
know or whatever it but it but the thing

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.830 
know or whatever it but it but the thing
is<00:03:39.040> about<00:03:39.370> that<00:03:39.640> it<00:03:39.850> doesn't<00:03:40.209> warp<00:03:40.540> the

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
is about that it doesn't warp the

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.990 
is about that it doesn't warp the
magnification<00:03:41.680> you<00:03:41.799> know<00:03:41.920> when<00:03:42.190> you<00:03:42.310> put<00:03:42.970> a

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
magnification you know when you put a

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.990 
magnification you know when you put a
mirror<00:03:43.269> up<00:03:43.540> and<00:03:43.810> then<00:03:44.709> you<00:03:44.920> get<00:03:45.400> all<00:03:45.640> sit<00:03:45.880> and

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
mirror up and then you get all sit and

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.970 
mirror up and then you get all sit and
get<00:03:46.090> big<00:03:46.360> the<00:03:46.720> magnificum<00:03:47.320> the<00:03:47.500> magnifying

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
get big the magnificum the magnifying

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.009 
get big the magnificum the magnifying
side<00:03:48.370> and<00:03:48.700> your<00:03:48.790> eyes<00:03:49.000> kind<00:03:49.330> of<00:03:49.420> hurt<00:03:49.690> a<00:03:49.840> little

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
side and your eyes kind of hurt a little

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:51.479 
side and your eyes kind of hurt a little
bit<00:03:50.230> or<00:03:50.410> they're<00:03:50.590> adjusting<00:03:51.070> to<00:03:51.190> the<00:03:51.280> bigness

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
bit or they're adjusting to the bigness

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:55.680 
bit or they're adjusting to the bigness
this<00:03:52.209> one<00:03:52.480> doesn't<00:03:52.720> do<00:03:52.959> that<00:03:53.110> it<00:03:53.320> gets<00:03:53.650> big<00:03:54.690> it

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
this one doesn't do that it gets big it

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.660 
this one doesn't do that it gets big it
magnifies<00:03:56.470> and<00:03:57.310> gets<00:03:57.489> big<00:03:57.760> without

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
magnifies and gets big without

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.190 
magnifies and gets big without
distorting<00:04:00.670> your<00:04:00.940> view<00:04:01.450> and<00:04:01.660> making<00:04:02.080> your

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
distorting your view and making your

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.750 
distorting your view and making your
eyes<00:04:02.350> hurt<00:04:02.680> so<00:04:03.190> I<00:04:03.220> thought<00:04:03.370> that<00:04:03.430> was<00:04:03.700> very

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
eyes hurt so I thought that was very

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.460 
eyes hurt so I thought that was very
interesting<00:04:04.239> but<00:04:04.570> I've<00:04:04.690> literally<00:04:05.049> honestly

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
interesting but I've literally honestly
