you look at the terminals are in right
bad<00:00:53.940> shape<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.930> then<00:00:55.079> we<00:00:55.170> got<00:00:55.350> our<00:00:55.380> device<00:00:55.770> to

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:55.950 
bad shape and then we got our device to

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.670 
bad shape and then we got our device to
clean<00:00:56.160> that<00:00:56.340> way<00:00:56.550> here's<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.180> device<00:00:57.680> with

and all that now this side it's the part
that<00:01:13.499> goes<00:01:13.590> on<00:01:13.859> the<00:01:14.009> terminal<00:01:14.399> itself<00:01:14.549> we'll

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
that goes on the terminal itself we'll

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.889 
that goes on the terminal itself we'll
put<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.299> lid<00:01:15.539> on<00:01:15.569> and<00:01:16.700> do<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.569> then<00:01:18.719> take

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:18.899 
put the lid on and do that and then take

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:22.789 
put the lid on and do that and then take
a<00:01:18.929> look<00:01:19.079> at<00:01:19.139> the<00:01:19.759> condition<00:01:21.499> you<00:01:22.499> don't<00:01:22.590> want

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
a look at the condition you don't want

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.379 
a look at the condition you don't want
to<00:01:22.859> go<00:01:22.979> back<00:01:23.249> and<00:01:23.429> forth<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.030> want<00:01:24.179> to<00:01:24.240> go

00:01:24.379 --> 00:01:24.389 
to go back and forth and you want to go

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:30.849 
to go back and forth and you want to go
in<00:01:24.960> one<00:01:25.139> direction<00:01:26.659> and<00:01:27.659> work<00:01:27.929> your<00:01:28.109> way<00:01:28.229> up

00:01:30.849 --> 00:01:30.859 

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:33.230 

because<00:01:31.859> if<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.069> look<00:01:32.249> at<00:01:32.399> it<00:01:32.549> if<00:01:32.609> you<00:01:32.759> go<00:01:32.939> one

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
because if you look at it if you go one

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.959 
because if you look at it if you go one
direction<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:33.840> then<00:01:33.959> go<00:01:34.439> together<00:01:34.819> the<00:01:35.819> way

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:35.969 
direction and then go together the way

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:37.819 
direction and then go together the way
these<00:01:36.149> little<00:01:36.509> cleaning<00:01:36.990> splines<00:01:37.409> will<00:01:37.679> be

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
these little cleaning splines will be

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.590 
these little cleaning splines will be
they'll<00:01:38.039> they'll<00:01:38.549> fold<00:01:38.850> back<00:01:39.119> over<00:01:39.479> on

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
they'll they'll fold back over on

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.910 
they'll they'll fold back over on
themselves<00:01:39.950> and<00:01:40.950> that's<00:01:41.100> not<00:01:41.280> good<00:01:41.780> yo<00:01:42.920> you'll

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
themselves and that's not good yo you'll

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.499 
themselves and that's not good yo you'll
just<00:01:44.159> ruin<00:01:46.939> there<00:01:47.939> we're<00:01:48.029> gonna<00:01:48.149> do<00:01:48.299> that<00:01:48.450> a

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
just ruin there we're gonna do that a

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.510 
just ruin there we're gonna do that a
couple<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.840> pounds<00:01:49.229> on<00:01:49.289> both<00:01:49.529> terminals<00:01:49.829> this

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
couple of pounds on both terminals this

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.179 
couple of pounds on both terminals this
one<00:01:50.700> feels<00:01:50.969> smaller<00:01:51.829> we're<00:01:52.829> gonna<00:01:52.950> go<00:01:53.100> the

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
one feels smaller we're gonna go the

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.699 
one feels smaller we're gonna go the
opposite<00:01:53.520> direction<00:01:53.670> on<00:01:54.090> this<00:01:54.560> one<00:01:55.560> direction

00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:55.709 
opposite direction on this one direction

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:57.499 
opposite direction on this one direction
or<00:01:56.069> the<00:01:56.100> other<00:01:56.189> we<00:01:56.729> don't<00:01:56.850> put<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.179> on<00:01:57.270> there

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
or the other we don't put it on there

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:11.640 
or the other we don't put it on there
and<00:01:57.600> then<00:01:57.719> switch<00:01:57.929> directions

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.140 

and<00:02:12.650> both<00:02:12.860> these<00:02:13.100> posts<00:02:13.610> are<00:02:13.700> supposed<00:02:13.970> to<00:02:14.030> be

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
and both these posts are supposed to be

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.250 
and both these posts are supposed to be
the<00:02:14.240> same<00:02:14.450> diameter

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
the same diameter

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.020 
the same diameter
I<00:02:15.290> can<00:02:15.980> tell<00:02:16.160> there's<00:02:16.340> a<00:02:16.460> difference<00:02:16.790> in<00:02:16.940> the

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
I can tell there's a difference in the

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.610 
I can tell there's a difference in the
size<00:02:17.560> one<00:02:18.560> to<00:02:18.740> the<00:02:18.800> other<00:02:19.990> the<00:02:20.990> negative<00:02:21.380> side

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
size one to the other the negative side

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.300 
size one to the other the negative side
is<00:02:23.260> larger<00:02:25.120> and<00:02:26.120> that's<00:02:26.210> good<00:02:26.540> enough

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
is larger and that's good enough

when<00:02:51.470> you<00:02:51.560> look<00:02:51.740> at<00:02:51.920> it<00:02:52.040> the<00:02:52.580> teeth<00:02:52.880> are<00:02:53.060> going

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:53.240 
when you look at it the teeth are going

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.760 
when you look at it the teeth are going
in<00:02:53.480> a<00:02:53.570> forward<00:02:53.960> direction<00:02:53.990> isn't<00:02:54.500> gonna

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
in a forward direction isn't gonna

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.470 
in a forward direction isn't gonna
indicate<00:02:55.100> on<00:02:55.460> this<00:02:55.640> plate<00:02:55.910> it's<00:02:56.270> a<00:02:56.300> nice

Stanley blade it's a bi-metal blade so

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:02.050 
Stanley blade it's a bi-metal blade so
it<00:02:59.360> should<00:02:59.750> be<00:02:59.780> good<00:03:00.050> for<00:03:00.260> cutting<00:03:00.500> metal<00:03:01.060> and

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
it should be good for cutting metal and

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.670 
it should be good for cutting metal and
you<00:03:02.330> want<00:03:02.510> your<00:03:02.630> teeth<00:03:02.870> going<00:03:03.200> in<00:03:03.320> the<00:03:03.410> forward

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
overtop of a drop cloth so we don't get

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.680 
overtop of a drop cloth so we don't get
all<00:03:16.010> these<00:03:17.800> metal<00:03:18.800> shavings<00:03:19.040> and<00:03:19.690> then
