00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.910
 with the liquid ingredients and now 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.610
 let's move on to the liquid part 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.990

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.990

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:37.060

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:59.609
 vegetable oil also not use oil 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.390
 olive because if it is not for cooking 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:05.780
 pastry 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.780
 now let's use a small box of yogurt 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:16.109

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.560
 d 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.540

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.540
 teaspoonful 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.240
 we started here 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:50.800
 well let's move on 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.800
 to avoid the ingredients 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.069
 I do not know 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:07.040
 but then everyone 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.040
 so 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:16.450
 for me now of the psoe 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:16.450
 the demands of the eu 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.370
 and we say 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.800
 in that area see better 

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:32.799
 for my movement we pour it into the 

00:04:31.209 --> 00:04:35.619
 mold of the world has to be of 

00:04:32.799 --> 00:04:38.349
 butter befriended with flour a little 

00:04:35.619 --> 00:04:39.610
 on the banks of heart posts of 

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:42.149
 presence of heart because it is like that 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.149
 because they have bitten 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:50.080
 we have the cake made in the 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:53.319
 mold for how long you put it in the 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.509
 area 40 minutes at 180 degrees 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:57.870
 only to equip it is to put in the 

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:57.870
 plate 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.949

 more see what a heart is 

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:25.599
 lighting and doing this there are people who 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:26.819
 what it does is that they split the cake to the 

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:29.949
 half 

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:33.069
