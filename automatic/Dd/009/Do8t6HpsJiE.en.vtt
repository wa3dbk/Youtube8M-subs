00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:07.170
 presents the new collection for the 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.510
 2015-16 glove season value 309 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.519
 evo is called evo and he jumps us in the 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.200
 numbering of 309 because it's simply 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.849
 an evolution of the model that we already saw in 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.320
 the previous season and in that 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.820
 evolves because it really is a 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.470
 involution what it does is become more 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.300
 classic return to the original trend 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.789
 of the glove value that is trying to be the 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.199
 most classic model possible that had the 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.820
 glove from the previous collection that we 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.170
 He finished liking everything because those 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.640
 fingers with angular finishing 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.320
 Maybe they made the sizes not be 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.610
 exactly correct and above all 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.170
 lost the concept of classic cut 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.090
 well then in the value glove of the 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.850
 2015 season the value of the collection 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.260
 high five fingers are rounded and 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.149
 they come back with that flat cut and the finish 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.290
 rounded that is as classic as possible 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.290
 when it comes to building a glove 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.350
 and a second element we have skipped 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.879
 the classicism here yes we lose that 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.309
 classic concept is the color the 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.230
 haifa collection this season is going to 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.940
 be a total introduction of color in 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.290
 the gloves that's why we have chosen the 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.790
 color green fluorine the color that goes to 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.560
 have more presence in gloves than 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:10.990
 group the season and we have assembled it 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.990
 in the glove with classic cut value 309 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.020
 characteristics of the glove that already 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.090
 You know, the back is a 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.399
 combination of a very fine natural latex 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.079
 a latex with many segments to be able 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:23.100
 create different bending points and that 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:25.770
 in no time we find ourselves 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.600
 uncomfortable and everything mounted on the textile 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.490
 mpfc to say that we have introduced 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.530
 two or three collections that you love and 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.119
 that is practically in the hundred 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.079
 one hundred of the gloves of soloporteros de 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.079
 the 2015 collection 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.220
 we went on to talk about the palm of the palm 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.870
 as said earlier the model that 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.330
 you are seeing is the model with cut to 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.890
 gray in the model in green always in 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.200
 flat with the wrap on the thumb 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.550
 to help us put this finger together with the 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.040
 little dots that will help us create 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.080
 Bending without forming into a hard bag 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.360
 in the area of ​​the palm and this area 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.980
 reinforced with an elastic textile and very 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.750
 resistant so that they do not occur 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.750
 breaks in this area of ​​so much tension 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.140
 for the wrist of the closure we use a 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.150
 very classic system that you already know that 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.070
 is a wrist was elastic two points of 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.630
 Fixing Velcro something that is already very 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.340
 incorporated alain to value how is a 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.050
 introduction of a piece of the back one 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.180
 Wristband to create a feeling of 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.890
 continuity throughout the glove and also 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.050
 we introduce this new Velcro Velcro 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.880
 much more technical that is fixed just like 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.260
 the anterior rectum but that is not so 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.580
 aggressive nor so rough so you do not 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:37.640
 break the fingertips when 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:39.020
 I contacted the radio and made 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.580
 about the grip logic mode but as 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.130
 you know the collection is much more 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.450
 complete we have a model with palms of 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.370
 water with palms what what what 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.510
 you wear a much more porous latex than us 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.610
 will help when the ball is 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.550
 wet we absorb all the water possible and 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.480
 the risk is greatly reduced the planète if 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.070
 what you want is a glove with 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.140
 protections that will help stocks 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.239
 more aggressive because we have this model 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.489
 that this one is mounted with white palm and 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.770
 that carries removable protections and 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:04.730
 all fingers if we lift this area 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.040
 we find some rods 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.570
 internal that will allow us 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.250
 bend your finger forward but do not 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.780
 you can with hyperextension with the 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.420
 consequent risk of injury 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.950
 during the game if you do not want models 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.330
 high- end you do not want models with 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.680
 palm which I took them to grip you have 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.600
 always an intermediate model between the 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.340
 low range and the high range a model with 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.350
 palm gave me a soft a finish on a 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.120
 fluorine we have said that the even 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.830
 of the dyna value is flooded with color to 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.420
 this season and that is going to give you that 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.239
 perfect balance between grip and 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.130
 duration depending on the type of use 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.630
 crossed the glove and of course if 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.640
 you want a glove that gives you a lot 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.650
 performance with regard to 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.239
 term erosion resistance in 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.190
 more abrasive fields because we have 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:45.230
 our characteristic latex hard ground 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.080
 a much denser latex much more 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.519
 compact that above is synthetic and 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.010
 get a good grip especially in 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:53.860
 dry and its main characteristic is 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.420
 a very high resistance to erosion 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.880
 guys you know all the collection of 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.380
 value 309 evo is an evolution of the 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.450
 model that you had previously but 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.590
 going back to the larger classicism that 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.580
 has made it one of the lines that 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.810
 longer takes our collection 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.810
 he has not called me
