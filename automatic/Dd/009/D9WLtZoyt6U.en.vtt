00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.040
 Hello, my name is Anna Koshkina 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.620
 and today I want to continue the lesson on 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.420
 tightening the tablet means this one 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.340
 the very tablet that I pulled into 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.480
 last lesson that is, he is already with 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.000
 the work performed 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.050
 anonymous watercolor i do the work and 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.760
 Today I want to show how to cut 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.580
 I work from a tablet that is our 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.630
 tablet here it is edge means what we do 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:30.750
 it means we push between the tablet and 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:39.180
 the edge can be somewhere so that from below and where 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:43.500
 then start starting to cut try 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.780
 you can pierce the knife between the tablet 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.190
 also tie and try just 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.629
 hold a knife 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:55.860
 I can not see that is, I spend a knife and 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:58.410
 starting the paper here I shoved a knife and now 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.020
 already just starting out like this 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.850
 cut the shadows which even edges 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:08.159
 will just need to take and 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:12.330
 align with a ruler take a ticker 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:16.590
 Beautifully attach a pencil and trim 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:20.250
 scissors or stationery knife here on 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.110
 surfaces respectively edges then 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.090
 will need to align with work 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.070
 but also want to say see you mostly 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.460
 the tablet is stretched very well kirsten 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.890
 no 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.590
 the skew paper is absolutely even though 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.610
 when we pulled wet she was she 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:40.229
 was let's say so before drying it 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:43.880
 very charred after 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.380
 dried paper became perfectly even on 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.070
 the tablet is stretched correctly then the paper 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.899
 It will be very beautiful to lie on it and 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.299
 in general, I want to say at all for what 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.159
 pull the paper to paper on a rod 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.860
 more convenient to draw it 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:02.100
 The first on a stretched tablet can be 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.610
 you can draw with pencils 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:09.479
 and gouaches can be painted with watercolor 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.410
 but I want to say most for for 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.140
 tensioning 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.750
 most of all in the tension let's say about 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.470
 more properly born all the same 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.350
 watercolor 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.110
 why because when you draw you 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:26.180
 take on kraz on the brush a lot 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:29.489
 water paint accordingly and it turns out 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.680
 that paper from a lot of water 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:36.989
 starts getting scared and i'm starting 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:39.840
 leaves and so as if for example 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:43.739
 drawing can be done by attaching 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:47.040
 just clamping and holding but only big 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.090
 attention if the picture can be so 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.940
 accomplish that 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.370
 watercolor you can do it but 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:57.239
 eventually the paper will seem 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.860
 as if she was a little crushed so all sorts 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.200
 cd-key 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:05.069
 watercolor works it is desirable that 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.410
 on made on a stretched tablet I will treat 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:09.530
 Of course you just can not pull but 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.269
 it is still more convenient to draw on the tablet 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.890
 Well, this is the final picture 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.980
 it is also more convenient of course to draw on 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.810
 tablet but if gouache drawing you can 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.060
 plans to execute without pulling 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.049
 the paper itself is nothing like it 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.280
 was flat and remains exactly the 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:29.130
 watercolor with watercolor 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.980
 it will be my job 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.910
 done to cut on the edges of ksk I said 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:40.170
 will need to flip up to take 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:43.620
 tick pencil mark from linear 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:46.950
 and then cut to align here but I think 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.769
 what is it basically do yourself let's 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:53.150
 I'll show you a little bit again 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:55.890
 the usual work that performed 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.200
 foreground made in more detail 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.109
 the back is a little blurred he is 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.390
 was my idea now what to do 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:06.359
 that is, here are my buttons and buttons 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.010
 shoot this way but we don't need 

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:09.780
 because next time we will 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:13.830
 use this tablet so we 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:18.049
 I need to remove the buttons I take out the buttons 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.049
 a little shorter things, our ponies broke off 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:28.590
 it will take us all the same to take 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:32.910
 tighter my knife on the other okay here 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:34.440
 pull the buttons around the perimeter i.e. 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.650
 complete with all the notes should be 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.650
 stretched out 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:43.200
 and it can be pulled out and used after 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:46.440
 of how pva glue has already taken and prisoh 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:51.150
 tablet along with the paper can be on this 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:53.280
 In principle, the buttons did not interfere with us. 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.960
 go work because they are with round 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.240
 hats, that is, if the buttons were 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:00.060
 some other you need them 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:04.620
 it would be necessary to remove it is not terrible you interfere 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:08.810
 when working here after glue 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:12.750
 together with paper prisoh here well and so time 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:15.380
 as if sponges and still with such hats 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.990
 it was not necessary to cut them off 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:22.050
 you understood right at the beginning 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:25.620
 completely remove all the buttons here and 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:27.360
 further paper remains paper can 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.480
 rip off can not rip off for a day 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.760
 nicer it will still tear as 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:35.070
 it turns out as they could and she stripped 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:38.030
 even if we later pull 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:40.919
 principle will not hinder us much 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:45.090
 this way we wipe it remains 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:51.169
 so here can stay in such here 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:54.630
 see along with the glue and completely 

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:56.280
 we finish paper in order to 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:59.760
 the next stretch the tablet was like 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:01.830
 ready here that is here like here 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:07.110
 completely peeled edge will be 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:10.590
 way to look well that's all i think 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:13.979
 what do you understand you understand I think that you have 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:16.729
 too everything will turn out good luck with you 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:16.729
