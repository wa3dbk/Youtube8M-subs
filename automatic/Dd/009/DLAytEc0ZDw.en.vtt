00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:08.370
 It's really weird 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:11.570
 If you are posting a video on youtube that is today you are not much video editing 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:16.279
 I think that software is used 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:20.360
 Showy of Tteyuu person a person potentially interested that a video posted in those who have seen the video of the Usa 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:23.270
 What software should I use? What software do I use? What software do I use? 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:28.460
 I wonder if you are telling me 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:31.590
 So if you see through that video you're looking at that girl you're looking at comment Rati I like this software 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:34.590
 A little lie and comment able to say I am using 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:41.010
 c I think Uz Originally 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:46.550
 Still the first time has entered the Mac I'd do not want a year, including the videos, such as in imob 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:51.579
 Soon after this, which was a little non-video editing software Tteyuu 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:55.269
 Buy the song before the Patty shot player elevator 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:58.239
 Now that the US photo processing and the stick do Pyeongchang 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:00.219
 Photoshop Ya because the movies is sometimes a little carried out originally to not sleep 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.510
 I understand how to use the illustrator 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:08.189
 By it was not what he had said so much Te video editing 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:12.600
 And browsed in what will become a fool and waited for the use in the bookstore there Femi 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.560
 It does not not mean that you can head suitably I like that a lot many things to remember the operation of the basic 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.490
 But a little 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.710
 It's easy to become an animated ninja, and I 've been here for a while and I have a little trouble 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:24.350
 I will 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:29.140
 adobe Nene Premier n benz is also very easy to use 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:33.950
 Chat ne recent years photoshop and illustrator 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:38.630
 What does the buzzer use is adobe software and illustrator cs 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:40.910
 It's a bit old software like this, but after that you have a photoshop old 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:45.800
 Is I was using cs 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:49.190
 In so little it is not sulfuric acid towards the photoshop is if put N usually sufficient uncle 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:54.860
 I'm satisfied with the use way of san in time 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:59.200
 Video editing is almost daily or once every two days 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:02.229
 I do not remember whether I want to use a full-scale software 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.380
 Is here for in was a little trial monday 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:11.019
 Hey I'd light it may be hard to see and ended up reflection 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:15.519
 I'm an adobe premiere pro I tried it a bit more 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:17.319
 I 'm sorry I 'm sorry I 'm sorry to say that this screen interface is the arrangement 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:19.190
 It seems that I can change it a little 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:19.840
 This is a standard condition 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.489
 me 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:27.590
 Here I'd say the timeline sequence Rutte and has come out the video of the timeline 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:30.590
 The right side is the video 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:36.560
 It becomes the picture of 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:37.610
 I cut off various things while checking various animations here and cut and get letters 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:43.930
 Can do 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:47.079
 I material tool of such video materials and or a character on the left side is the feeling to enter this 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.980
 The left side is for the video you are editing 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:55.650
 What a source 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:57.110
 It is possible to cut in various tabs and such people and it seems that very detailed setting can be done 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.620
 Right 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:05.150
 There are many great items for writing 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.600
 In fact, it's a bit different from adobe's previous premiere 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.120
 Say 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:14.300
 There is a lot of information 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:19.580
 So has previously Premier stallion of adobe also over here the right to say 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:23.050
 It's this is hit now is you want to do the Koch It is a guy you are using much is simple 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:27.940
 There may be something that can be done quickly 

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:28.900
 After all about the processing of the video and moving the premiere pro gold comfortably move 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.740
 That's right 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.770
 eh 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:38.260
 I'm not a trouble but this 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:39.940
 Because it does not is doing it so difficult Tteyuu fact Woods's uses videos in the Premier 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.460
 It's enough in time but 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:47.410
 But if a little would play around with professional black Likes 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.410
 You think that black is good 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.260
 I think 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.690

 But it's not a good Do city if I remember good kana of Tteyuu say 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:16.910
 And the place to say is whether we need 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:18.350
 I tried to edit the game video one more time this time, but I can still read it 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:23.240
 If the file is large thanks 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:24.430

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:30.250

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:49.700

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:56.210
 buying and selling In addition, in another video a 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:57.700
 But you know adobe of increasing Mia professional This I monthly I take 2200 yen this software alone 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:02.200
 But it is 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:04.260
 The fee is a bit of a neck, I 'm not a professional. 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.260
 Hey 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.060
