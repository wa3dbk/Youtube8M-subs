Dale<00:01:59.819> and<00:02:00.300> Planescape<00:02:00.659> torment<00:02:01.289> I<00:02:01.619> think<00:02:02.130> the

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
Dale and Planescape torment I think the

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.139 
Dale and Planescape torment I think the
appeal<00:02:02.550> in<00:02:04.220> the<00:02:05.220> Infinity<00:02:05.549> entry<00:02:05.789> games<00:02:05.970> was

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
appeal in the Infinity entry games was

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.740 
appeal in the Infinity entry games was
really<00:02:06.830> the<00:02:07.830> story<00:02:08.100> the<00:02:08.519> setting<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:09.420> also

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
really the story the setting and also

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.930 
really the story the setting and also
the<00:02:09.989> tactical<00:02:10.380> combat<00:02:10.530> this<00:02:11.459> were<00:02:11.640> the

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
the tactical combat this were the

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.430 
the tactical combat this were the
classic<00:02:12.510> locked<00:02:13.350> camera<00:02:14.220> view<00:02:14.580> top-down

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
classic locked camera view top-down

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.539 
classic locked camera view top-down
looking<00:02:16.440> at<00:02:16.530> your<00:02:16.620> whole<00:02:16.799> party<00:02:17.130> looking<00:02:17.400> at<00:02:17.519> a

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
looking at your whole party looking at a

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:19.699 
looking at your whole party looking at a
battlefield<00:02:17.910> I<00:02:18.750> think<00:02:19.260> there's<00:02:19.380> a<00:02:19.470> really

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
battlefield I think there's a really

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.380 
battlefield I think there's a really
great<00:02:19.830> appeal<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.400> that<00:02:20.519> and<00:02:20.850> I<00:02:21.090> think<00:02:21.269> that's

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
great appeal to that and I think that's

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.509 
great appeal to that and I think that's
a<00:02:21.450> really<00:02:21.690> fun<00:02:21.989> style<00:02:22.350> of<00:02:22.500> game<00:02:22.739> and<00:02:23.430> that's

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
a really fun style of game and that's

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:24.830 
a really fun style of game and that's
that's<00:02:23.850> the<00:02:23.970> sort<00:02:24.150> of<00:02:24.180> thing<00:02:24.330> that<00:02:24.360> we<00:02:24.540> want<00:02:24.690> to

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
that's the sort of thing that we want to

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.840 
that's the sort of thing that we want to
capture<00:02:25.319> but<00:02:25.980> as<00:02:26.069> all<00:02:26.190> our<00:02:26.250> ideas<00:02:26.610> came

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
capture but as all our ideas came

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.309 
capture but as all our ideas came
together<00:02:26.970> we<00:02:27.510> really<00:02:27.810> had<00:02:27.930> to<00:02:27.959> kind<00:02:28.140> of<00:02:28.170> figure

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
together we really had to kind of figure

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:29.870 
together we really had to kind of figure
out<00:02:28.470> well<00:02:28.739> how<00:02:28.890> we<00:02:28.950> were<00:02:29.310> actually<00:02:29.580> gonna<00:02:29.670> make

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
out well how we were actually gonna make

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.460 
out well how we were actually gonna make
this<00:02:30.030> game<00:02:30.269> and<00:02:30.540> that's<00:02:31.109> really<00:02:31.290> why

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
this game and that's really why

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.930 
this game and that's really why

clear<00:04:04.320> of<00:04:04.440> that<00:04:04.560> these<00:04:04.890> days<00:04:05.130> and<00:04:05.430> I<00:04:05.489> think

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
clear of that these days and I think

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:07.070

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
because that's the other thing that's

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.620 
because that's the other thing that's
really<00:04:08.400> appealing<00:04:08.790> about<00:04:08.970> it<00:04:09.180> is<00:04:09.269> it's<00:04:09.510> not

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:09.630 
really appealing about it is it's not

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:11.270 
really appealing about it is it's not
just<00:04:09.690> a<00:04:10.050> fantasy<00:04:10.500> setting<00:04:10.769> it's<00:04:11.040> something
