let's see if we get the headset off so I

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.990 
let's see if we get the headset off so I
can<00:01:37.020> show<00:01:37.200> you<00:01:37.259> how<00:01:37.409> that<00:01:37.560> works

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.440 

there<00:01:42.000> we<00:01:42.119> go

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
there we go

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.130 
there we go
so<00:01:42.659> here's<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.649> headset<00:01:44.040> itself<00:01:44.960> very<00:01:45.960> very

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
so here's the headset itself very very

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.410 
so here's the headset itself very very
very<00:01:46.619> light<00:01:47.270> it's<00:01:48.270> only<00:01:48.950> 7.2<00:01:49.950> grams<00:01:50.420> according

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
very light it's only 7.2 grams according

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.270 
very light it's only 7.2 grams according
to<00:01:51.780> LG<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.079> can<00:01:52.200> see<00:01:52.350> how<00:01:52.500> thin<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.009> is<00:01:53.100> it's

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
to LG you can see how thin it is it's

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.380 
to LG you can see how thin it is it's
rather<00:01:53.430> long<00:01:53.700> so<00:01:53.909> let's<00:01:54.060> look<00:01:54.149> at<00:01:54.270> some

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
rather long so let's look at some

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.359 
rather long so let's look at some
microphone<00:01:54.810> close<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.259> your<00:01:55.409> mouth<00:01:55.950> for<00:01:56.310> the

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
microphone close to your mouth for the

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.609 
microphone close to your mouth for the
proper<00:01:56.850> voice<00:01:57.000> pickup<00:01:57.479> but<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.140> really<00:01:58.380> really

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
proper voice pickup but it really really

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.700 
proper voice pickup but it really really
thin<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:58.979> really<00:01:59.250> really<00:01:59.549> light<00:01:59.790> it's<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.719> 15

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
thin and really really light it's a 15

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.340 
thin and really really light it's a 15
millimeters<00:02:02.430> why<00:02:03.090> not<00:02:03.420> long<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:03.990> guess<00:02:04.170> you

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
millimeters why not long I guess you

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.370 
millimeters why not long I guess you
would<00:02:04.439> say<00:02:04.649> it<00:02:05.579> supports<00:02:06.030> five<00:02:06.750> hours<00:02:07.079> of<00:02:07.200> talk

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
would say it supports five hours of talk

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.240 
would say it supports five hours of talk
time<00:02:07.409> or<00:02:07.680> 200<00:02:08.369> hours<00:02:08.610> of<00:02:08.640> standby<00:02:09.060> time<00:02:09.619> so<00:02:10.619> you

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
time or 200 hours of standby time so you

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.610 
time or 200 hours of standby time so you
can<00:02:11.340> see<00:02:11.489> as<00:02:11.610> I<00:02:11.730> mentioned<00:02:12.060> here<00:02:12.239> here's<00:02:12.510> the

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
can see as I mentioned here here's the

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.890 
can see as I mentioned here here's the
car<00:02:14.190> adapter<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:14.880> say<00:02:15.060> you<00:02:15.120> had<00:02:15.360> this<00:02:15.480> stuck

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
car adapter and say you had this stuck

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.960 
car adapter and say you had this stuck
in<00:02:16.020> your<00:02:16.110> dash<00:02:16.319> like<00:02:16.620> so<00:02:16.980> you'll<00:02:17.670> see<00:02:17.819> the

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
in your dash like so you'll see the

the<00:03:27.030> red<00:03:27.239> tip<00:03:27.480> here's<00:03:27.810> where<00:03:28.019> you<00:03:28.109> find<00:03:28.320> one<00:03:28.530> of

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
the red tip here's where you find one of

the red tip here's where you find one of

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
the two microphone holes and then there

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.680 
the two microphone holes and then there
are<00:03:31.950> the<00:03:32.280> contacts<00:03:32.760> for<00:03:33.030> charging<00:03:33.510> through

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
are the contacts for charging through

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.170 
are the contacts for charging through
the<00:03:33.750> cradle<00:03:34.260> now<00:03:34.950> the<00:03:35.010> device<00:03:35.370> itself<00:03:35.730> I<00:03:35.910> think

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
the cradle now the device itself I think

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.150 
the cradle now the device itself I think
I<00:03:36.299> mentioned<00:03:36.480> where<00:03:36.750> he's<00:03:36.840> 7.2<00:03:37.590> grams<00:03:37.920> the

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
I mentioned where he's 7.2 grams the

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.360 
I mentioned where he's 7.2 grams the
cradle<00:03:38.579> weighs<00:03:39.329> another<00:03:39.720> almost<00:03:40.140> 17<00:03:40.829> grams<00:03:41.130> so

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
cradle weighs another almost 17 grams so

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.150 
cradle weighs another almost 17 grams so
if<00:03:41.519> you<00:03:41.609> want<00:03:41.790> to<00:03:41.959> take<00:03:42.959> that<00:03:43.139> into<00:03:43.319> account<00:03:43.350> in

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
if you want to take that into account in

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.379 
if you want to take that into account in
terms<00:03:44.250> your<00:03:44.489> packing<00:03:44.940> if<00:03:45.060> you're<00:03:45.209> really

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:45.389 
terms your packing if you're really

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:49.460 
terms your packing if you're really
counting<00:03:45.750> grams<00:03:45.989> they're<00:03:46.910> very<00:03:47.910> nice<00:03:48.440> feel<00:03:49.440> to

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
counting grams they're very nice feel to

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.819

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
it

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.800 
it
it's<00:03:50.250> very<00:03:50.430> comfortable<00:03:50.850> on<00:03:51.060> the<00:03:51.180> ear<00:03:51.359> both

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
it's very comfortable on the ear both

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.030 
it's very comfortable on the ear both
with<00:03:52.049> and<00:03:52.230> without<00:03:52.319> the<00:03:52.500> loop<00:03:52.769> and<00:03:52.980> that

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
with and without the loop and that

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.020 
with and without the loop and that
reminds<00:03:53.489> me<00:03:53.639> there's<00:03:53.880> a<00:03:53.940> couple<00:03:54.420> different

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
reminds me there's a couple different

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.400 
reminds me there's a couple different
earpieces<00:03:57.030> here<00:03:57.359> of<00:03:57.450> different<00:03:57.750> size<00:03:57.989> so<00:03:58.350> you

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
earpieces here of different size so you

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.470 
earpieces here of different size so you
could<00:03:58.650> potentially<00:03:58.889> use<00:03:59.130> one<00:03:59.910> of<00:04:00.030> these<00:04:00.180> and

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
could potentially use one of these and

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.030 
could potentially use one of these and
manage<00:04:00.840> to<00:04:00.959> use<00:04:01.079> the<00:04:01.200> devices<00:04:01.470> completely

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
manage to use the devices completely

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.349 
manage to use the devices completely
without<00:04:02.310> the<00:04:02.459> ear<00:04:02.579> loop<00:04:02.760> although<00:04:03.060> I<00:04:03.090> prefer

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:03.359 
without the ear loop although I prefer

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:05.990 
without the ear loop although I prefer
to<00:04:03.630> use<00:04:03.750> your<00:04:03.959> loops<00:04:04.370> when<00:04:05.370> you<00:04:05.489> first<00:04:05.730> pair

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
to use your loops when you first pair
