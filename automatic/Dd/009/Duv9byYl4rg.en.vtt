00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:59.100 
that basically means that a trip from
home<00:03:57.730> to<00:03:58.000> work<00:03:58.180> at<00:03:58.390> 9:00<00:03:58.750> a.m.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
home to work at 9:00 a.m.

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.289 
home to work at 9:00 a.m.
may<00:03:59.590> yield<00:03:59.769> a<00:03:59.950> different<00:04:00.489> route<00:04:00.670> from<00:04:01.150> the

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:01.299 
may yield a different route from the

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:03.810 
may yield a different route from the
same<00:04:01.570> trip<00:04:01.959> planned<00:04:02.290> at<00:04:02.620> 11:00<00:04:03.100> a.m.<00:04:03.220> or<00:04:03.549> even

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
same trip planned at 11:00 a.m. or even

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.449 
same trip planned at 11:00 a.m. or even
5:00<00:04:04.150> p.m.<00:04:04.480> based<00:04:05.170> on<00:04:05.380> historic<00:04:05.920> and<00:04:06.100> current

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
5:00 p.m. based on historic and current

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:17.440 
5:00 p.m. based on historic and current
traffic<00:04:06.880> trends

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:22.250 

so<00:04:18.450> around<00:04:18.780> town<00:04:19.170> the<00:04:19.760> Mazda<00:04:20.760> cx-5<00:04:21.239> is<00:04:21.720> a

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
so around town the Mazda cx-5 is a

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.560 
so around town the Mazda cx-5 is a
little<00:04:22.560> bit<00:04:22.650> rougher<00:04:23.100> than<00:04:23.610> other<00:04:24.090> vehicles

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
little bit rougher than other vehicles

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.990 
little bit rougher than other vehicles
in<00:04:24.690> its<00:04:24.780> class<00:04:25.170> that<00:04:25.890> a<00:04:26.190> little<00:04:26.520> bit<00:04:26.640> of<00:04:26.700> extra

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
in its class that a little bit of extra

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.580 
in its class that a little bit of extra
roughness<00:04:27.510> kind<00:04:27.750> of<00:04:27.810> gives<00:04:27.960> you<00:04:28.080> the<00:04:28.260> illusion

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
roughness kind of gives you the illusion

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.800 
roughness kind of gives you the illusion
that<00:04:29.250> the<00:04:29.700> car<00:04:29.970> would<00:04:30.090> have<00:04:30.270> some<00:04:30.510> sort<00:04:30.690> of

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
that the car would have some sort of

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.900 
that the car would have some sort of
really<00:04:31.230> good<00:04:31.440> road<00:04:31.650> handling<00:04:31.920> chops<00:04:32.460> and<00:04:32.760> I

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
really good road handling chops and I

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.080 
really good road handling chops and I
mean<00:04:33.090> that<00:04:33.120> about<00:04:33.690> regular<00:04:34.440> around<00:04:34.710> town<00:04:35.130> you

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
mean that about regular around town you

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:38.060 
mean that about regular around town you
know<00:04:36.180> zipping<00:04:36.630> down<00:04:36.900> an<00:04:37.050> off-ramp<00:04:37.470> you<00:04:37.950> know

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
know zipping down an off-ramp you know

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.650 
know zipping down an off-ramp you know
quickly<00:04:38.460> cutting<00:04:38.790> around<00:04:39.060> a<00:04:39.120> corner<00:04:39.360> type

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
quickly cutting around a corner type

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.440 
quickly cutting around a corner type
speed<00:04:39.990> it's<00:04:40.830> not<00:04:40.890> bad<00:04:41.280> now<00:04:42.090> the<00:04:42.150> biggest

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
speed it's not bad now the biggest

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.300 
speed it's not bad now the biggest
problem<00:04:42.870> that<00:04:42.900> I<00:04:43.050> think<00:04:43.110> a<00:04:43.530> lot<00:04:43.890> of<00:04:43.920> people<00:04:44.220> are

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
problem that I think a lot of people are

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.400 
problem that I think a lot of people are
going<00:04:44.400> to<00:04:44.460> have<00:04:44.640> on<00:04:45.000> their<00:04:45.180> first<00:04:45.480> outing<00:04:45.630> with

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
going to have on their first outing with

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.700 
going to have on their first outing with
the<00:04:46.500> cx-5<00:04:47.040> is<00:04:47.220> that<00:04:47.820> well<00:04:48.420> under<00:04:49.260> fifty<00:04:49.530> five

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
the cx-5 is that well under fifty five

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.170 
the cx-5 is that well under fifty five
horsepower<00:04:50.040> doesn't<00:04:50.490> sound<00:04:50.670> like<00:04:50.820> a<00:04:50.910> lot<00:04:51.090> on

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
horsepower doesn't sound like a lot on

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.150 
horsepower doesn't sound like a lot on
paper<00:04:51.450> and<00:04:51.810> it's<00:04:52.020> not<00:04:52.440> a<00:04:52.470> lot<00:04:52.830> of<00:04:52.950> horsepower

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
paper and it's not a lot of horsepower

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.100 
paper and it's not a lot of horsepower
in<00:04:53.670> practice<00:04:54.180> you're<00:04:54.540> going<00:04:54.660> to<00:04:54.720> have<00:04:54.840> a<00:04:54.870> hard

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
in practice you're going to have a hard

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.960 
in practice you're going to have a hard
time<00:04:55.290> just<00:04:55.560> hanging<00:04:55.770> onto<00:04:56.040> 50<00:04:56.490> mile<00:04:56.670> an<00:04:56.700> hour

Automatic transmission actually isn't
that<00:05:03.300> bad<00:05:03.480> I<00:05:04.050> mean<00:05:04.170> aside<00:05:04.470> from<00:05:04.530> a<00:05:04.910> tendency<00:05:05.910> to

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
that bad I mean aside from a tendency to

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.870 
that bad I mean aside from a tendency to
jump<00:05:06.810> all<00:05:07.020> the<00:05:07.050> way<00:05:07.230> up<00:05:07.350> six<00:05:07.680> gear<00:05:08.040> thereby

jump all the way up six gear thereby

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:11.000 
jump all the way up six gear thereby
leaving<00:05:09.180> you<00:05:09.270> out<00:05:09.420> of<00:05:09.570> the<00:05:09.660> power<00:05:09.870> band<00:05:10.230> when

leaving you out of the power band when
you<00:05:11.130> do<00:05:11.340> actually<00:05:11.910> need<00:05:12.240> it<00:05:12.480> to<00:05:13.020> give<00:05:13.440> you<00:05:13.560> a

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
you do actually need it to give you a

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.170 
you do actually need it to give you a
little<00:05:13.830> bit<00:05:14.010> of<00:05:14.070> extra<00:05:14.340> get<00:05:14.580> up<00:05:14.700> and<00:05:14.850> go<00:05:14.970> it<00:05:15.150> is

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
little bit of extra get up and go it is

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.060 
little bit of extra get up and go it is
happy<00:05:15.720> to<00:05:15.840> downshift<00:05:16.080> and<00:05:16.590> it'll<00:05:16.830> drop<00:05:16.950> down

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
happy to downshift and it'll drop down

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.370

into<00:05:17.490> fifth<00:05:17.700> if<00:05:18.480> you<00:05:18.570> give<00:05:18.720> it<00:05:18.840> just<00:05:18.870> a<00:05:19.350> little

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
into fifth if you give it just a little
