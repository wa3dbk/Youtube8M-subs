it<00:01:24.799> is<00:01:26.950> dry<00:01:27.950> it<00:01:28.579> takes<00:01:28.850> a<00:01:28.969> while<00:01:29.119> to<00:01:29.329> dry

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
it is dry it takes a while to dry

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.940 
it is dry it takes a while to dry
depending<00:01:29.929> on<00:01:29.929> how<00:01:30.109> thick<00:01:30.320> you<00:01:30.439> pour<00:01:30.649> it<00:01:31.420> and

depending on how thick you pour it and
as<00:01:33.950> you<00:01:34.130> can<00:01:34.280> see<00:01:35.140> also<00:01:37.750> then<00:01:38.750> you're<00:01:39.439> done<00:01:39.619> in

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
as you can see also then you're done in

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.559 
as you can see also then you're done in
here<00:01:40.119> it<00:01:41.119> is<00:01:41.539> flexible<00:01:42.530> so<00:01:43.000> you<00:01:44.000> don't<00:01:44.360> have<00:01:44.420> to

00:01:44.559 --> 00:01:44.569 
here it is flexible so you don't have to

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:47.709 
here it is flexible so you don't have to
worry<00:01:44.840> about<00:01:45.490> any<00:01:46.490> kind<00:01:46.700> of<00:01:46.850> flex<00:01:47.329> with<00:01:47.689> the

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:47.719 
worry about any kind of flex with the

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:49.809 
worry about any kind of flex with the
miniatures<00:01:48.500> are<00:01:48.530> you<00:01:48.740> playing<00:01:49.159> with<00:01:49.280> them<00:01:49.640> or

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:49.819 
miniatures are you playing with them or

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:53.649 
miniatures are you playing with them or
your<00:01:50.240> terrain<00:01:50.929> pieces<00:01:51.500> it<00:01:52.429> will<00:01:52.729> move<00:01:53.030> as<00:01:53.479> you

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
your terrain pieces it will move as you

00:01:53.659 --> 00:02:00.669 
your terrain pieces it will move as you
can<00:01:53.840> see<00:01:54.469> there<00:01:57.009> so<00:01:58.149> does<00:01:59.149> stay<00:01:59.390> flexible<00:01:59.899> but

00:02:00.669 --> 00:02:00.679 
can see there so does stay flexible but

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:02.979 
can see there so does stay flexible but
it's<00:02:01.429> still<00:02:01.700> hard<00:02:02.060> we'll<00:02:02.599> leave<00:02:02.780> any

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:02.989 
it's still hard we'll leave any

00:02:02.989 --> 00:02:05.649 
it's still hard we'll leave any
fingerprints<00:02:03.530> once<00:02:03.860> it's<00:02:04.039> dry<00:02:04.369> I<00:02:04.659> believe

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.659 
fingerprints once it's dry I believe

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.589 
fingerprints once it's dry I believe
once<00:02:06.170> you<00:02:06.289> get<00:02:06.409> to<00:02:06.439> the<00:02:06.649> drying<00:02:06.979> process<00:02:07.599> where

00:02:08.589 --> 00:02:08.599 
once you get to the drying process where

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:10.539 
once you get to the drying process where
it's<00:02:08.720> starting<00:02:09.110> to<00:02:09.200> harden<00:02:09.410> and<00:02:09.799> thicken<00:02:10.310> up<00:02:10.399> a

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:10.549 
it's starting to harden and thicken up a

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:13.150 
it's starting to harden and thicken up a
little<00:02:10.849> you<00:02:11.420> can<00:02:11.629> take<00:02:12.530> some<00:02:12.860> kind<00:02:13.069> of

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
little you can take some kind of

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.180 
little you can take some kind of
sculpting<00:02:13.700> tools<00:02:13.940> toothpicks<00:02:14.629> and<00:02:15.010> put<00:02:16.010> in

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
sculpting tools toothpicks and put in

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.500 
sculpting tools toothpicks and put in
some<00:02:16.879> little<00:02:17.090> ripples<00:02:17.629> to<00:02:18.879> make<00:02:19.879> an<00:02:20.060> effect

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
some little ripples to make an effect

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.449 
some little ripples to make an effect
with<00:02:20.810> or<00:02:21.459> striations<00:02:22.459> or<00:02:22.700> whatnot<00:02:24.459> haven't

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
with or striations or whatnot haven't

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.610 
with or striations or whatnot haven't
tried<00:02:25.730> that<00:02:25.760> so<00:02:26.329> I<00:02:26.510> don't<00:02:26.780> really<00:02:26.930> know<00:02:27.230> but<00:02:27.560> i

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
tried that so I don't really know but i

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.410 
tried that so I don't really know but i
think<00:02:27.890> is<00:02:28.069> possible<00:02:28.400> if<00:02:28.910> you<00:02:29.030> let<00:02:29.180> it<00:02:29.209> thicken

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
think is possible if you let it thicken

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.349 
think is possible if you let it thicken
up<00:02:29.690> enough<00:02:30.019> now<00:02:30.829> for<00:02:31.130> the<00:02:31.430> really<00:02:31.579> cool<00:02:31.850> part

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:34.359 

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:37.420 

let<00:02:35.359> me<00:02:35.420> show<00:02:35.630> you<00:02:35.660> this<00:02:35.989> is<00:02:36.380> you<00:02:36.590> when<00:02:37.310> it

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
let me show you this is you when it

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.089 
let me show you this is you when it
comes<00:02:37.639> out<00:02:37.790> of<00:02:37.850> the<00:02:38.090> bottle<00:02:38.959> i<00:02:39.139> can<00:02:39.799> get<00:02:39.980> it

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
comes out of the bottle i can get it

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:43.800 
comes out of the bottle i can get it
open<00:02:40.190> here<00:02:40.549> because<00:02:40.790> it's<00:02:40.970> stuck<00:02:41.299> together

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810

what<00:03:02.040> the<00:03:02.159> color<00:03:02.370> would<00:03:02.519> be<00:03:02.549> but<00:03:03.540> when<00:03:04.019> it

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:04.139 
what the color would be but when it

what the color would be but when it
dries<00:03:04.469> out<00:03:04.829> here's<00:03:05.760> what<00:03:06.239> you'll<00:03:06.450> get<00:03:06.719> if

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
dries out here's what you'll get if

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.250 
dries out here's what you'll get if
you're<00:03:07.230> going<00:03:07.379> four<00:03:07.650> clear<00:03:08.900> how<00:03:09.900> cool<00:03:10.109> was

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
you're going four clear how cool was

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.470 
you're going four clear how cool was
that<00:03:12.500> absolutely<00:03:13.500> clear<00:03:14.280> when<00:03:14.639> it<00:03:14.760> dries<00:03:15.060> I

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
that absolutely clear when it dries I

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.929 
that absolutely clear when it dries I
just<00:03:16.409> painted<00:03:16.590> some<00:03:16.889> blue<00:03:17.099> under<00:03:17.370> there<00:03:17.549> you

00:03:17.929 --> 00:03:17.939 
just painted some blue under there you

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:19.550 
just painted some blue under there you
could<00:03:18.329> use<00:03:18.510> it<00:03:18.540> for<00:03:18.689> like<00:03:18.959> if<00:03:19.079> you<00:03:19.169> were<00:03:19.260> making

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
could use it for like if you were making

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.470 
could use it for like if you were making
a<00:03:19.650> pool<00:03:19.859> and<00:03:20.159> you<00:03:20.280> wanted<00:03:20.519> to<00:03:20.609> paint<00:03:20.849> the<00:03:21.090> base

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
a pool and you wanted to paint the base

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.869 
a pool and you wanted to paint the base
and<00:03:21.780> then<00:03:22.230> put<00:03:22.469> the<00:03:22.650> water<00:03:22.889> effect<00:03:23.549> or<00:03:23.790> the

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:23.879 
and then put the water effect or the

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:25.849 
and then put the water effect or the
pouring<00:03:24.480> medium<00:03:24.780> rats<00:03:24.989> not<00:03:25.139> a<00:03:25.169> water<00:03:25.439> effect

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:25.859 
pouring medium rats not a water effect

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:29.300 
pouring medium rats not a water effect
it's<00:03:26.519> just<00:03:26.849> a<00:03:27.000> poor<00:03:27.299> medium<00:03:27.810> for<00:03:28.109> making<00:03:28.650> clear

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
it's just a poor medium for making clear

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:35.420 
it's just a poor medium for making clear
sheets<00:03:31.699> so<00:03:32.719> as<00:03:33.719> you<00:03:33.930> can<00:03:34.169> see<00:03:34.409> you<00:03:35.040> can<00:03:35.219> see

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
sheets so as you can see you can see

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.159 
sheets so as you can see you can see
right<00:03:35.669> through<00:03:35.969> it's<00:03:36.120> absolutely<00:03:36.959> clear

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:37.169 
right through it's absolutely clear

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:39.379 
right through it's absolutely clear
it'll<00:03:38.010> show<00:03:38.219> up<00:03:38.370> anything<00:03:39.000> that<00:03:39.239> you<00:03:39.359> put

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:39.389 
it'll show up anything that you put

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:41.659 
it'll show up anything that you put
underneath<00:03:39.900> it<00:03:40.230> if<00:03:40.439> you<00:03:40.650> pour<00:03:41.400> it<00:03:41.549> straight

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:41.669 
underneath it if you pour it straight

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:45.170 
underneath it if you pour it straight
out<00:03:41.879> of<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.299> bottle<00:03:43.219> really<00:03:44.219> neat<00:03:44.459> stuff<00:03:44.849> and

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
out of the bottle really neat stuff and

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.959 
out of the bottle really neat stuff and
as<00:03:45.719> you<00:03:45.840> noticed<00:03:46.319> I<00:03:46.650> hope<00:03:47.459> the<00:03:47.579> camera<00:03:47.849> can

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:47.969 
as you noticed I hope the camera can

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:49.970 
as you noticed I hope the camera can
pick<00:03:48.000> it<00:03:48.180> up<00:03:48.299> you<00:03:48.510> don't<00:03:48.629> see<00:03:48.870> any<00:03:49.139> bubbles<00:03:49.409> if

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
pick it up you don't see any bubbles if

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.319 
pick it up you don't see any bubbles if
you<00:03:50.129> see<00:03:50.340> anything<00:03:50.730> that<00:03:50.939> looks<00:03:51.150> like<00:03:51.269> a

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:51.329 
you see anything that looks like a

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:53.629 
you see anything that looks like a
bubble<00:03:51.599> that's<00:03:51.870> because<00:03:52.230> of<00:03:52.439> the<00:03:52.639> styrofoam

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:53.639 
bubble that's because of the styrofoam

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:56.330 
bubble that's because of the styrofoam
plate<00:03:54.180> that<00:03:54.389> I<00:03:54.479> used<00:03:54.810> but<00:03:55.590> it<00:03:55.709> drives<00:03:55.979> without

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
plate that I used but it drives without

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.659 
plate that I used but it drives without
bubbles<00:03:56.790> so<00:03:57.120> that's<00:03:57.329> a<00:03:57.799> very<00:03:58.799> very<00:03:59.129> nice

00:03:59.659 --> 00:03:59.669 
bubbles so that's a very very nice

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:02.330 
bubbles so that's a very very nice
feature<00:04:00.000> to<00:04:00.209> have<00:04:00.359> a<00:04:00.840> lot<00:04:01.349> of<00:04:01.379> water<00:04:01.799> effects

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
feature to have a lot of water effects

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.640 
feature to have a lot of water effects
that<00:04:02.579> I've<00:04:02.759> seen<00:04:03.000> and<00:04:03.269> I'll<00:04:03.359> be<00:04:03.479> doing<00:04:03.629> another

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.949 

review<00:04:07.650> of<00:04:07.829> a<00:04:07.979> product<00:04:08.489> that<00:04:08.669> that<00:04:09.540> is<00:04:09.720> what

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
review of a product that that is what

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.649 
review of a product that that is what
are<00:04:10.109> effects<00:04:10.470> but<00:04:11.459> I<00:04:11.489> don't<00:04:11.759> think<00:04:11.970> it's<00:04:12.209> going

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:12.659 
are effects but I don't think it's going

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:14.360 
are effects but I don't think it's going
to<00:04:12.750> have<00:04:12.959> the<00:04:13.259> properties<00:04:13.799> at<00:04:13.979> this<00:04:14.159> wheel

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
to have the properties at this wheel

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.189 
to have the properties at this wheel
where<00:04:14.609> it<00:04:14.699> will<00:04:14.849> be<00:04:15.000> flexible<00:04:15.599> you<00:04:15.930> will<00:04:16.019> have

00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:16.199 
where it will be flexible you will have

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:17.930 
where it will be flexible you will have
to<00:04:16.320> worry<00:04:16.500> about<00:04:16.709> cracking<00:04:17.220> it<00:04:17.579> tells<00:04:17.820> you

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
to worry about cracking it tells you

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.860 
to worry about cracking it tells you
that<00:04:18.090> right<00:04:18.299> on<00:04:18.509> the<00:04:19.789> label<00:04:20.789> know<00:04:21.659> if<00:04:21.750> it'll

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
that right on the label know if it'll

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.990 
that right on the label know if it'll
picked<00:04:22.079> it<00:04:22.199> up<00:04:22.289> there<00:04:22.590> we<00:04:22.860> go<00:04:23.039> pause<00:04:23.610> it<00:04:23.639> to

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
picked it up there we go pause it to

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.720 
picked it up there we go pause it to
read<00:04:24.150> it<00:04:24.330> if<00:04:25.139> you<00:04:25.380> wish<00:04:25.530> to

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730

read it if you wish to
and<00:04:28.540> it<00:04:28.690> gives<00:04:28.840> you<00:04:29.140> the<00:04:29.530> properties<00:04:30.280> of<00:04:30.310> it

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
and it gives you the properties of it

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.760 
and it gives you the properties of it
right<00:04:30.790> there<00:04:31.060> you<00:04:31.360> can<00:04:31.510> use<00:04:31.990> it<00:04:32.020> for<00:04:32.440> paint

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
right there you can use it for paint

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.010 
right there you can use it for paint
will<00:04:33.520> dry<00:04:33.550> like<00:04:34.000> glass<00:04:34.360> it<00:04:34.750> will<00:04:34.900> be

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
will dry like glass it will be

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.980 
will dry like glass it will be
transparent<00:04:35.770> it<00:04:36.460> is<00:04:36.670> kind<00:04:37.210> of<00:04:37.330> fluid<00:04:37.720> so<00:04:37.960> it

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
transparent it is kind of fluid so it

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.440 
transparent it is kind of fluid so it
will<00:04:38.590> pour<00:04:38.980> easily<00:04:39.670> and<00:04:39.850> like<00:04:39.970> I<00:04:40.060> said<00:04:40.120> you<00:04:40.420> can

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
will pour easily and like I said you can

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.540 
will pour easily and like I said you can
just<00:04:40.780> the<00:04:41.410> colors<00:04:41.740> are<00:04:41.890> endless<00:04:42.220> what<00:04:42.400> you

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
just the colors are endless what you

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.940 
just the colors are endless what you
could<00:04:42.700> do<00:04:42.850> with<00:04:42.880> this<00:04:43.180> folks<00:04:43.650> you<00:04:44.650> could<00:04:44.800> put

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
could do with this folks you could put

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.710 
could do with this folks you could put
two<00:04:45.310> colors<00:04:45.640> close<00:04:45.820> together<00:04:46.030> and<00:04:46.330> use

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
two colors close together and use

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.690 
two colors close together and use
something<00:04:46.990> like<00:04:47.020> a<00:04:47.140> toothpick<00:04:47.440> to<00:04:48.040> kind<00:04:48.640> of

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
something like a toothpick to kind of

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.310 
something like a toothpick to kind of
