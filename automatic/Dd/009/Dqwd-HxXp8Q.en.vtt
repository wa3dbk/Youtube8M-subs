pole operate for different skiers at
different<00:02:45.900> set<00:02:46.109> speeds<00:02:46.470> you<00:02:47.220> can<00:02:47.489> look<00:02:47.699> at

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
different set speeds you can look at

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.909 
different set speeds you can look at
your<00:02:48.120> ballast<00:02:48.479> system<00:02:48.630> monitor<00:02:49.260> how<00:02:49.440> much<00:02:49.709> is

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:49.919 
your ballast system monitor how much is

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:50.520 
your ballast system monitor how much is
in<00:02:50.070> each

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
in each

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.860 
in each
ank<00:02:50.680> you<00:02:50.980> can<00:02:51.520> look<00:02:51.700> at<00:02:51.819> your<00:02:51.970> wedge<00:02:52.180> position

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
ank you can look at your wedge position

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.600 
ank you can look at your wedge position
and<00:02:53.080> then<00:02:53.200> have<00:02:53.410> all<00:02:53.590> your<00:02:53.740> vitals<00:02:54.190> with<00:02:54.310> volt

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
and then have all your vitals with volt

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.390 
and then have all your vitals with volt
temperature<00:02:55.209> all<00:02:55.420> gauges<00:02:55.720> fuel<00:02:56.709> gauge<00:02:56.980> and

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
temperature all gauges fuel gauge and

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.699 
temperature all gauges fuel gauge and
still<00:02:58.060> some<00:02:58.390> redundancy<00:02:59.020> with<00:02:59.290> kind<00:02:59.590> of<00:02:59.650> the

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
still some redundancy with kind of the

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.570 
still some redundancy with kind of the
old<00:02:59.860> analog<00:03:00.310> look<00:03:00.640> and<00:03:00.970> then<00:03:01.810> some<00:03:02.580> LCD

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
old analog look and then some LCD

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.000 
old analog look and then some LCD
displays<00:03:04.000> on<00:03:04.209> those<00:03:04.420> so<00:03:04.720> it's<00:03:04.959> it's<00:03:05.709> kind<00:03:05.950> of

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
displays on those so it's it's kind of

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.520 
displays on those so it's it's kind of
the<00:03:06.130> monitoring<00:03:06.880> the<00:03:07.569> control<00:03:08.020> there's

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
the monitoring the control there's

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.949 
the monitoring the control there's
control<00:03:08.980> here<00:03:09.250> with<00:03:09.400> the<00:03:09.550> new<00:03:09.670> touch<00:03:09.910> pad<00:03:10.270> so

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
control here with the new touch pad so

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.530 
control here with the new touch pad so
here's<00:03:11.290> basically<00:03:11.739> your<00:03:12.069> switches<00:03:12.580> to<00:03:13.390> where

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
here's basically your switches to where

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.010 
here's basically your switches to where
you<00:03:13.690> can<00:03:13.870> do<00:03:14.380> your<00:03:14.530> lights<00:03:14.800> do<00:03:15.190> you<00:03:15.340> ballast

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
you can do your lights do you ballast

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.380 
you can do your lights do you ballast
employ<00:03:17.020> or<00:03:17.319> deploy<00:03:17.709> your<00:03:17.980> wedge<00:03:18.250> and<00:03:18.700> it's

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
employ or deploy your wedge and it's

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.630 
employ or deploy your wedge and it's
keyless<00:03:20.170> there's<00:03:20.410> a<00:03:20.500> lot<00:03:20.650> going<00:03:20.680> on<00:03:21.040> keyless

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
keyless there's a lot going on keyless

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.030 
keyless there's a lot going on keyless
start<00:03:22.060> with<00:03:22.480> security<00:03:22.989> yeah<00:03:23.260> that's<00:03:23.590> great<00:03:23.830> I

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
start with security yeah that's great I

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.160 
start with security yeah that's great I
really<00:03:24.970> like<00:03:25.090> the<00:03:25.239> mirror<00:03:25.450> hero<00:03:25.660> that<00:03:25.900> you

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
really like the mirror hero that you

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.229 
really like the mirror hero that you
know<00:03:26.260> usually<00:03:26.560> you<00:03:26.769> see<00:03:27.010> it<00:03:27.070> attached<00:03:27.880> to<00:03:28.120> the

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
know usually you see it attached to the

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.050 
know usually you see it attached to the
header<00:03:28.600> here<00:03:28.810> but<00:03:29.190> well<00:03:30.190> it's<00:03:30.430> a<00:03:30.580> it's<00:03:30.820> another

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
header here but well it's a it's another

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.509 
header here but well it's a it's another
option<00:03:31.480> we<00:03:31.600> do<00:03:31.810> it's<00:03:32.080> nice<00:03:32.320> to<00:03:32.620> attach<00:03:33.160> stuff

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
option we do it's nice to attach stuff

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:35.580 
option we do it's nice to attach stuff
especially<00:03:34.239> when<00:03:34.600> you<00:03:34.690> have<00:03:34.840> the<00:03:34.959> Bimini<00:03:35.319> tops

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
especially when you have the Bimini tops

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.770 
especially when you have the Bimini tops
to<00:03:36.370> get<00:03:36.580> it<00:03:36.700> up<00:03:36.850> and<00:03:37.030> the<00:03:37.180> farther<00:03:37.420> you<00:03:37.510> get<00:03:37.660> it

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
to get it up and the farther you get it

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.720 
to get it up and the farther you get it
up<00:03:37.930> people<00:03:38.170> can<00:03:38.530> go<00:03:38.680> through<00:03:38.950> so<00:03:39.220> use<00:03:39.430> it<00:03:39.580> as<00:03:39.700> a

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
up people can go through so use it as a

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.670 
up people can go through so use it as a
pathway<00:03:40.030> and<00:03:40.480> then<00:03:40.600> your<00:03:40.750> visibility<00:03:41.140> out

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
pathway and then your visibility out

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.460 
pathway and then your visibility out
back<00:03:41.950> is<00:03:42.550> greatly<00:03:42.970> enhance<00:03:43.480> so<00:03:43.810> it<00:03:43.989> works

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
back is greatly enhance so it works

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.020 
back is greatly enhance so it works
really<00:03:44.560> well<00:03:44.769> well<00:03:45.280> it's<00:03:45.370> great<00:03:45.489> let's<00:03:45.819> take<00:03:45.910> a

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
really well well it's great let's take a

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.590 
really well well it's great let's take a
look<00:03:46.239> at<00:03:46.330> the<00:03:46.480> forward<00:03:46.780> up<00:03:47.110> a<00:03:48.090> social<00:03:49.090> zone<00:03:49.390> up

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
here that is a social zone dennis is

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.509 
here that is a social zone dennis is
quite<00:03:52.390> an<00:03:52.510> adult<00:03:52.870> playpen<00:03:53.410> up<00:03:53.560> here<00:03:53.860> you<00:03:54.400> know
