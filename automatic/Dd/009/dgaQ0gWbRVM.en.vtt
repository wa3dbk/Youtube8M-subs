00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 
and I got the feels mainly because I

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:15.429

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
and I'm always into something I'm always

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.449 
and I'm always into something I'm always
doing<00:02:32.660> something<00:02:32.930> and<00:02:33.470> it's<00:02:33.830> hard<00:02:34.069> for<00:02:34.160> me<00:02:34.370> to

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
doing something and it's hard for me to

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.339 
doing something and it's hard for me to
just<00:02:34.610> like<00:02:34.790> sit<00:02:35.120> down<00:02:35.300> I<00:02:35.569> like<00:02:35.720> sleep<00:02:36.140> all<00:02:36.319> day

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
just like sit down I like sleep all day

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:38.470 
just like sit down I like sleep all day
like<00:02:36.680> I<00:02:36.890> cannot<00:02:37.250> do<00:02:38.030> that

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
like I cannot do that

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.210 
like I cannot do that
at<00:02:38.660> all<00:02:38.930> when<00:02:39.080> I<00:02:39.170> think<00:02:39.379> it<00:02:39.680> also<00:02:39.860> presents

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
at all when I think it also presents

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.309 
at all when I think it also presents
stress<00:02:41.030> eating<00:02:41.300> and<00:02:41.629> that's<00:02:41.810> something<00:02:42.080> that

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
stress eating and that's something that

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.130 
stress eating and that's something that
I<00:02:42.379> also<00:02:42.620> have<00:02:43.610> pretty<00:02:44.030> bad<00:02:44.390> so<00:02:44.840> that's<00:02:45.019> a

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
I also have pretty bad so that's a

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.870 
I also have pretty bad so that's a
benefit<00:02:45.500> for<00:02:45.739> me<00:02:45.800> because<00:02:46.280> when<00:02:46.430> I<00:02:46.459> do<00:02:46.550> get

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
benefit for me because when I do get

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.920 
benefit for me because when I do get
stressed<00:02:47.180> out<00:02:47.330> I<00:02:47.599> will<00:02:48.110> tend<00:02:48.500> to<00:02:49.120> lean<00:02:50.120> towards

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
stressed out I will tend to lean towards

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.490 
stressed out I will tend to lean towards
overeating<00:02:51.920> or<00:02:52.540> eating<00:02:53.540> junk<00:02:53.900> or<00:02:54.140> things<00:02:54.380> that

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
overeating or eating junk or things that

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.320 
overeating or eating junk or things that
are<00:02:54.739> unhealthy<00:02:55.069> for<00:02:55.459> me<00:02:55.489> are<00:02:55.760> just<00:02:55.790> eating

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
are unhealthy for me are just eating

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.930 
are unhealthy for me are just eating
really<00:02:56.660> really<00:02:57.019> large<00:02:57.200> portions<00:02:57.860> at<00:02:58.099> one<00:02:58.670> time

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
really really large portions at one time

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.610 
really really large portions at one time
and<00:02:59.360> it<00:02:59.450> does<00:02:59.660> that<00:02:59.930> because<00:03:00.049> they<00:03:00.319> kind<00:03:00.530> of

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
and it does that because they kind of

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.640 
and it does that because they kind of
curves<00:03:00.950> your<00:03:01.190> appetite<00:03:01.730> to<00:03:02.030> prevent<00:03:02.390> you<00:03:02.599> from

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
curves your appetite to prevent you from

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.259 
curves your appetite to prevent you from
strength<00:03:03.650> eating<00:03:04.010> or<00:03:04.190> overeating<00:03:04.610> and<00:03:05.030> then

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
strength eating or overeating and then

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:06.940 
strength eating or overeating and then
it<00:03:05.420> also<00:03:05.599> can<00:03:06.019> help<00:03:06.140> regulate<00:03:06.530> or<00:03:06.920> control

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
it also can help regulate or control

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:09.190 
it also can help regulate or control
your<00:03:07.489> blood<00:03:07.730> sugar<00:03:07.790> I<00:03:08.360> don't<00:03:08.569> have<00:03:08.959> an<00:03:09.079> issue
