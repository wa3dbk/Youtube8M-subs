some<00:00:46.559> idea<00:00:46.920> of<00:00:46.980> on<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.250> technical<00:00:47.730> specs<00:00:47.820> of

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
some idea of on the technical specs of

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.000 
some idea of on the technical specs of
these<00:00:48.329> speakers<00:00:48.629> so<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.410> green<00:00:49.590> ones<00:00:49.829> right

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
these speakers so the green ones right

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.560 
these speakers so the green ones right
here<00:00:50.039> these<00:00:50.340> are<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.550> x-men<00:00:51.030> max<00:00:51.329> these<00:00:51.510> are

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
here these are the x-men max these are

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.330 
here these are the x-men max these are
their<00:00:51.750> stereo<00:00:52.260> units<00:00:52.680> that<00:00:52.829> are<00:00:52.890> both<00:00:53.070> a

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
their stereo units that are both a

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.709 
their stereo units that are both a
compact<00:00:54.500> modular<00:00:55.500> design<00:00:56.090> basically<00:00:57.090> compact

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
compact modular design basically compact

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.360 
compact modular design basically compact
meaning<00:00:58.079> they<00:00:58.199> actually<00:00:58.590> get<00:00:58.710> bigger<00:00:59.010> for

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
meaning they actually get bigger for

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.490 
meaning they actually get bigger for

about<00:02:36.900> this<00:02:37.200> one<00:02:37.440> is<00:02:37.470> it<00:02:37.650> actually<00:02:37.890> has<00:02:38.130> a

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
about this one is it actually has a

volume knob if you see here you can make

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:42.410 
volume knob if you see here you can make
it<00:02:41.130> louder<00:02:41.310> you<00:02:41.520> can<00:02:41.670> quiet<00:02:41.940> so<00:02:42.270> I'm<00:02:42.330> assuming

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
it louder you can quiet so I'm assuming

them is the Max's have this little

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.510 
them is the Max's have this little
speaker<00:03:58.170> cover<00:03:58.500> right<00:03:58.800> here<00:03:59.040> which<00:03:59.160> is<00:03:59.310> trying

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
speaker cover right here which is trying

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.110 
speaker cover right here which is trying
to<00:03:59.580> protect<00:03:59.880> the<00:03:59.970> cone<00:04:00.560> they<00:04:01.560> cantilever<00:04:02.120> so

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
to protect the cone they cantilever so

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.430 
to protect the cone they cantilever so
I'm<00:04:03.270> a<00:04:03.300> little<00:04:03.480> afraid<00:04:03.720> at<00:04:03.930> some<00:04:04.110> point<00:04:04.350> I'm

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
I'm a little afraid at some point I'm

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:05.960 
I'm a little afraid at some point I'm
going<00:04:04.530> to<00:04:04.620> end<00:04:04.740> up<00:04:04.770> breaking<00:04:05.010> these<00:04:05.370> off<00:04:05.670> I

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
going to end up breaking these off I

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.520 
going to end up breaking these off I
mean<00:04:06.090> it's<00:04:06.209> pretty<00:04:06.420> flexible<00:04:06.959> so<00:04:07.290> I<00:04:07.320> don't

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
mean it's pretty flexible so I don't

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:08.840 
mean it's pretty flexible so I don't
know<00:04:07.590> if<00:04:07.680> that's<00:04:07.830> going<00:04:07.950> to<00:04:08.010> happen<00:04:08.070> right

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
know if that's going to happen right

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:10.490 
know if that's going to happen right
that's<00:04:09.240> the<00:04:09.360> only<00:04:09.690> issue<00:04:09.720> I<00:04:10.020> think<00:04:10.140> in<00:04:10.440> the

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
that's the only issue I think in the

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.260 
that's the only issue I think in the
future<00:04:10.530> is<00:04:10.950> I'm<00:04:11.130> gonna<00:04:11.250> end<00:04:11.459> up<00:04:11.550> breaking<00:04:11.970> them

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
future is I'm gonna end up breaking them

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:14.360 
future is I'm gonna end up breaking them
off<00:04:12.450> yes<00:04:12.959> because<00:04:13.260> I'm<00:04:13.410> hard<00:04:13.860> on<00:04:14.040> everything

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
off yes because I'm hard on everything

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.610 
off yes because I'm hard on everything
but<00:04:14.760> they're<00:04:14.940> pretty<00:04:15.030> stout<00:04:15.390> in<00:04:15.690> all<00:04:16.140> honesty

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
but they're pretty stout in all honesty

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.410 
but they're pretty stout in all honesty
I<00:04:16.650> it<00:04:16.799> would<00:04:17.070> take<00:04:17.280> quite<00:04:17.430> an<00:04:17.670> impact<00:04:17.970> to<00:04:18.209> break

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:18.420 
I it would take quite an impact to break

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.150 
I it would take quite an impact to break
them<00:04:18.630> or<00:04:18.810> I<00:04:19.230> think<00:04:19.709> the<00:04:19.830> probably<00:04:20.130> the

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
them or I think the probably the

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.590 
them or I think the probably the
downside<00:04:20.609> what<00:04:20.760> might<00:04:20.910> happen<00:04:21.239> is<00:04:21.359> you<00:04:21.450> might

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
downside what might happen is you might

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.510 
downside what might happen is you might
get<00:04:21.780> them<00:04:21.900> hooked<00:04:22.109> on<00:04:22.380> something<00:04:22.800> yeah<00:04:23.310> and

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
get them hooked on something yeah and

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.360 
get them hooked on something yeah and
you<00:04:23.700> pull<00:04:24.090> in<00:04:24.510> that

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
you pull in that

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.310 
you pull in that
where<00:04:25.490> you<00:04:25.610> might<00:04:25.790> break<00:04:25.940> them<00:04:26.240> that's<00:04:27.080> my

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
where you might break them that's my

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.100 
where you might break them that's my
only<00:04:27.590> really<00:04:28.100> concern<00:04:28.520> yeah<00:04:28.729> I<00:04:28.940> really<00:04:29.870> like

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
that's not a bad idea we ought to try

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:08.469 
that's not a bad idea we ought to try
that<00:05:05.720> but<00:05:06.110> in<00:05:06.770> like<00:05:07.100> John<00:05:07.340> said<00:05:07.520> we<00:05:07.669> have<00:05:07.789> a<00:05:07.820> 4

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:08.479 
that but in like John said we have a 4

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
these a 4 out of 5 and the only the only

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.070 
these a 4 out of 5 and the only the only
negative<00:05:13.910> that<00:05:14.060> i<00:05:14.090> have<00:05:14.300> to<00:05:14.419> say<00:05:14.570> it<00:05:14.660> alls<00:05:14.810> i

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
negative that i have to say it alls i

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.370 
negative that i have to say it alls i
would<00:05:15.229> like<00:05:15.410> to<00:05:15.590> see<00:05:15.770> it<00:05:15.860> have<00:05:16.039> USB<00:05:16.840> audio<00:05:17.840> and

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
would like to see it have USB audio and

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.860 
would like to see it have USB audio and
it<00:05:19.160> once<00:05:19.460> they<00:05:19.639> had<00:05:19.820> that<00:05:20.090> then<00:05:20.389> i<00:05:20.419> think<00:05:20.750> this

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
it once they had that then i think this

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.770 
it once they had that then i think this
is<00:05:21.080> almost<00:05:21.380> a<00:05:21.530> slam<00:05:21.770> dunk<00:05:22.300> five<00:05:23.300> out<00:05:23.479> of<00:05:23.510> five

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
is almost a slam dunk five out of five

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.840 
is almost a slam dunk five out of five
you<00:05:24.080> think<00:05:24.440> that's<00:05:24.740> how<00:05:25.190> many<00:05:25.370> people<00:05:25.729> would

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:25.850 
you think that's how many people would

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:27.700 
you think that's how many people would
actually<00:05:26.090> use<00:05:26.300> that<00:05:26.539> I<00:05:26.930> mean<00:05:27.080> I<00:05:27.260> just<00:05:27.440> think

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
actually use that I mean I just think

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.500 
actually use that I mean I just think
it'd<00:05:27.889> be<00:05:27.919> an<00:05:28.100> added<00:05:28.370> feature<00:05:28.400> okay<00:05:29.300> you<00:05:29.360> know

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:29.510 
it'd be an added feature okay you know

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:32.860 
it'd be an added feature okay you know
and<00:05:29.810> and<00:05:30.520> at<00:05:31.520> some<00:05:31.910> point<00:05:32.210> there's<00:05:32.479> the<00:05:32.660> some

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
and and at some point there's the some

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.230 
and and at some point there's the some
devices<00:05:33.200> out<00:05:33.500> there<00:05:33.530> that<00:05:33.919> don't<00:05:34.340> have<00:05:34.729> photo
