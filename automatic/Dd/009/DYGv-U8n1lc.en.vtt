00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.400 
Wi-Fi but you have an Ethernet port that
you<00:02:38.730> can<00:02:38.970> plug<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.240> cable<00:02:39.570> into<00:02:39.720> now<00:02:40.200> there's

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
you can plug the cable into now there's

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:41.810 
you can plug the cable into now there's
a<00:02:40.500> way<00:02:40.590> to<00:02:40.650> connect<00:02:40.950> to<00:02:40.980> transformer<00:02:41.460> private

little<00:02:48.180> lights<00:02:48.390> just<00:02:48.780> a<00:02:48.900> flashing<00:02:49.430> it<00:02:50.430> doesn't

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
little lights just a flashing it doesn't

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.370 
little lights just a flashing it doesn't
look<00:02:50.880> like<00:02:50.910> it's<00:02:51.150> flashing<00:02:51.360> that<00:02:51.720> fast<00:02:52.050> on<00:02:52.290> the

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
look like it's flashing that fast on the

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.410 
look like it's flashing that fast on the
camera<00:02:52.770> but<00:02:53.070> trust<00:02:53.310> me<00:02:53.459> it<00:02:53.580> is<00:02:53.760> maybe<00:02:54.300> it<00:02:54.390> just

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
camera but trust me it is maybe it just

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.150 
camera but trust me it is maybe it just
looks<00:02:54.750> that<00:02:54.870> way<00:02:55.020> for<00:02:55.470> my<00:02:55.590> computer<00:02:55.860> screen

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
looks that way for my computer screen

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.710 
looks that way for my computer screen
cuz<00:02:56.430> I'm<00:02:56.580> actually<00:02:56.760> watching<00:02:57.270> what<00:02:57.390> my<00:02:57.480> camera

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
cuz I'm actually watching what my camera

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.620 
cuz I'm actually watching what my camera
is<00:02:57.870> doing<00:02:58.140> via<00:02:58.320> my<00:02:58.560> laptop<00:02:59.010> so<00:02:59.370> USB<00:02:59.790> 2.0<00:03:00.270> this

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
is doing via my laptop so USB 2.0 this

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.650 
is doing via my laptop so USB 2.0 this
is<00:03:00.959> a<00:03:00.990> gigabit<00:03:01.680> adapter<00:03:02.220> but<00:03:02.640> with<00:03:02.790> USB<00:03:03.060> 2.0

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
is a gigabit adapter but with USB 2.0

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.930 
is a gigabit adapter but with USB 2.0
the<00:03:03.870> maximum<00:03:04.230> you<00:03:04.350> can<00:03:04.470> do<00:03:04.620> is<00:03:04.770> 480<00:03:05.700> megabits

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
the maximum you can do is 480 megabits

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.699 
the maximum you can do is 480 megabits
so<00:03:06.540> you're<00:03:06.660> not<00:03:06.750> gonna<00:03:06.870> get<00:03:07.080> to<00:03:07.200> use<00:03:07.380> a<00:03:07.410> whole

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
so you're not gonna get to use a whole

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.760 
so you're not gonna get to use a whole
1000<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:08.940> whole<00:03:09.060> gigabit<00:03:09.510> but<00:03:09.810> it's<00:03:10.320> faster

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
1000 the whole gigabit but it's faster

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.160 
1000 the whole gigabit but it's faster
than<00:03:10.920> the<00:03:10.980> 100<00:03:11.700> because<00:03:12.150> this<00:03:12.600> is<00:03:12.720> going<00:03:13.050> at

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
than the 100 because this is going at

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.590 
than the 100 because this is going at
480<00:03:13.980> megabits<00:03:14.220> per<00:03:14.580> second<00:03:15.000> instead<00:03:15.300> of<00:03:15.450> just

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
480 megabits per second instead of just

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.259 
480 megabits per second instead of just
100<00:03:16.350> and<00:03:16.560> yes<00:03:16.830> I<00:03:17.070> am<00:03:17.250> hooked<00:03:17.489> up<00:03:17.670> to<00:03:17.790> a<00:03:17.820> gigabit

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
turn it back on then it connects again

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:04.569 
turn it back on then it connects again
just<00:04:03.439> fine<00:04:03.650> it<00:04:04.010> looks<00:04:04.069> like<00:04:04.280> it's<00:04:04.430> still

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:04.579 
just fine it looks like it's still

just fine it looks like it's still

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:08.559 
flashing through the USB 2.0 Ethernet
adapter<00:04:07.549> so<00:04:07.790> it's<00:04:07.909> probably<00:04:08.150> using<00:04:08.420> that

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
adapter so it's probably using that

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:10.629 
adapter so it's probably using that
connection<00:04:08.900> instead<00:04:09.590> of<00:04:09.680> the<00:04:09.769> wireless<00:04:09.980> and

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:10.639

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:12.009 
connection instead of the wireless and
look<00:04:10.819> at<00:04:10.939> it<00:04:11.030> flashing<00:04:11.420> like<00:04:11.540> that

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
look at it flashing like that

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:13.360 
look at it flashing like that
I<00:04:12.049> would<00:04:12.319> recommend<00:04:12.620> your<00:04:12.680> string<00:04:12.889> Wi-Fi<00:04:13.220> off

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
I would recommend your string Wi-Fi off

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.250 
I would recommend your string Wi-Fi off
when<00:04:13.790> you're<00:04:13.970> connected<00:04:14.329> to<00:04:14.359> an<00:04:14.840> Ethernet

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
when you're connected to an Ethernet

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.580 
when you're connected to an Ethernet

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:17.389 
besides the Ethernet cable it's gonna be

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:18.819 
besides the Ethernet cable it's gonna be
more<00:04:17.570> reliable<00:04:18.049> than<00:04:18.139> a<00:04:18.229> wireless<00:04:18.259> connection

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
more reliable than a wireless connection
