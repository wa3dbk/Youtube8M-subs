kind<00:00:35.890> of<00:00:35.950> weather<00:00:36.130> it<00:00:36.820> was<00:00:36.970> really<00:00:37.600> bright<00:00:37.870> out

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
kind of weather it was really bright out

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.440 
kind of weather it was really bright out
there<00:00:38.110> and<00:00:38.739> I<00:00:38.950> guess<00:00:39.130> I'm<00:00:39.340> not<00:00:39.399> the<00:00:39.730> gloom<00:00:40.210> with

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:40.450 
there and I guess I'm not the gloom with

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.389 
there and I guess I'm not the gloom with
so<00:00:40.630> much<00:00:40.780> in<00:00:40.960> London<00:00:41.320> and<00:00:41.530> all<00:00:41.620> the<00:00:41.770> clouds<00:00:42.010> and

00:00:42.389 --> 00:00:42.399 
so much in London and all the clouds and

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:44.460 
so much in London and all the clouds and
I<00:00:42.550> didn't<00:00:43.390> really<00:00:43.870> take<00:00:44.260> that<00:00:44.410> into

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.470 
I didn't really take that into

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:46.229 
I didn't really take that into
consideration<00:00:44.860> but<00:00:45.610> other<00:00:45.850> than<00:00:45.910> that<00:00:46.090> the

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
consideration but other than that the

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:48.750 
consideration but other than that the
weather<00:00:46.420> was<00:00:46.630> fine<00:00:47.070> yeah<00:00:48.070> I<00:00:48.100> think<00:00:48.250> she<00:00:48.550> played

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:48.760 
weather was fine yeah I think she played

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.389 
weather was fine yeah I think she played
really<00:00:49.000> well<00:00:49.120> she<00:00:49.630> has<00:00:49.780> a<00:00:49.920> she<00:00:50.920> moves<00:00:51.190> really

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:51.399 
really well she has a she moves really

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:54.660 
really well she has a she moves really
well<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:52.840> she<00:00:53.230> doesn't<00:00:53.469> quit<00:00:53.800> and<00:00:54.130> that's<00:00:54.430> I

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
well and she doesn't quit and that's I

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.600 
well and she doesn't quit and that's I
think<00:00:54.700> that's<00:00:55.000> the<00:00:55.180> best<00:00:55.480> thing<00:00:55.600> you<00:00:55.840> can<00:00:55.989> have

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
think that's the best thing you can have

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.490 
think that's the best thing you can have
she<00:00:57.610> could<00:00:57.760> easily<00:00:57.969> gave<00:00:58.390> up<00:00:58.600> and<00:00:58.930> she<00:00:59.170> didn't

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
she could easily gave up and she didn't

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.729 
she could easily gave up and she didn't
and<00:00:59.770> I<00:01:00.610> think<00:01:01.570> that's<00:01:01.899> the<00:01:01.989> best<00:01:02.140> quality<00:01:02.530> you

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
and I think that's the best quality you

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:04.200 
and I think that's the best quality you
can<00:01:02.920> have<00:01:03.100> as<00:01:03.250> an<00:01:03.399> athlete<00:01:03.670> especially<00:01:03.910> a

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
can have as an athlete especially a

I<00:01:54.459> think<00:01:54.520> she<00:01:54.759> played<00:01:54.999> a<00:01:55.270> really<00:01:55.869> good<00:01:55.990> game

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:56.169 
I think she played a really good game

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:57.809 
I think she played a really good game
and<00:01:56.709> she<00:01:56.919> was<00:01:57.039> really<00:01:57.310> focused<00:01:57.700> the<00:01:57.789> whole

00:01:57.809 --> 00:01:57.819 
and she was really focused the whole

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:01.080 
and she was really focused the whole
time<00:01:58.179> and<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:59.590> she<00:02:00.340> didn't<00:02:00.609> play<00:02:00.759> with<00:02:00.939> too

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
time and and she didn't play with too

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.580 
time and and she didn't play with too
many<00:02:01.179> nerves<00:02:01.479> she<00:02:01.630> started<00:02:01.929> out<00:02:02.020> I<00:02:02.049> think<00:02:02.409> with

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
many nerves she started out I think with

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:03.870
