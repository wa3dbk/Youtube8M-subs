00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
this one I've heard mixed things I've

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.339 
this one I've heard mixed things I've
heard<00:02:51.010> that<00:02:51.220> target<00:02:51.700> is<00:02:51.849> allowing<00:02:52.689> only<00:02:52.870> five

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:53.349 
heard that target is allowing only five

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:55.860 
heard that target is allowing only five
of<00:02:53.680> the<00:02:53.799> same<00:02:53.980> items<00:02:54.430> per<00:02:55.329> person<00:02:55.720> per

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
of the same items per person per

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.569 
of the same items per person per
transaction<00:02:56.169> and<00:02:56.739> then<00:02:56.829> I've<00:02:56.919> also<00:02:57.040> heard

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
transaction and then I've also heard

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:00.030 
transaction and then I've also heard
from<00:02:58.419> some<00:02:58.780> stores<00:02:59.319> that<00:02:59.590> they're<00:02:59.799> just

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
from some stores that they're just

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.039 
from some stores that they're just
allowing<00:03:00.280> again<00:03:00.700> five<00:03:01.030> items<00:03:01.269> I<00:03:01.599> guess<00:03:01.780> just

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
allowing again five items I guess just

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.379 
allowing again five items I guess just
to<00:03:02.169> avoid<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:02.650> whole<00:03:02.799> like<00:03:03.209> buying<00:03:04.209> in<00:03:04.359> bulk

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:04.389 
to avoid the whole like buying in bulk

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:05.879 
to avoid the whole like buying in bulk
to<00:03:04.689> stick<00:03:04.959> up<00:03:05.079> on<00:03:05.200> ebay<00:03:05.530> thing<00:03:05.560> that's
