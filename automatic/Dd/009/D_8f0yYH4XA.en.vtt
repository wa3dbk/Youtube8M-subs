00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.630 
if I just push the adjusting bar forward
like<00:03:58.610> right<00:03:58.910> there<00:03:59.390> and<00:04:00.010> then<00:04:01.010> I<00:04:01.190> put<00:04:01.520> the

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
like right there and then I put the

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.330 
like right there and then I put the
lever<00:04:01.880> back<00:04:02.180> on<00:04:02.390> and<00:04:02.570> lock<00:04:02.810> it<00:04:02.989> in<00:04:03.080> position

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
lever back on and lock it in position

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:06.720 
lever back on and lock it in position
that's<00:04:04.340> going<00:04:04.640> to<00:04:04.760> make<00:04:05.420> an<00:04:05.540> adjustment<00:04:05.660> on<00:04:06.290> my

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
that's going to make an adjustment on my

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.370 
that's going to make an adjustment on my
Clippers<00:04:07.730> so<00:04:07.910> that<00:04:08.090> when<00:04:08.239> I<00:04:08.270> actually<00:04:08.570> do<00:04:09.230> the

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
Clippers so that when I actually do the

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.250 
Clippers so that when I actually do the
lever<00:04:09.620> action<00:04:09.890> it's<00:04:10.820> going<00:04:11.090> to<00:04:11.180> make<00:04:11.390> the<00:04:11.690> gap

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
lever action it's going to make the gap

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.009 
lever action it's going to make the gap
tighter<00:04:12.940> between<00:04:13.940> a<00:04:13.970> steel<00:04:14.480> blade<00:04:14.750> and<00:04:14.930> the

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
tighter between a steel blade and the

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:17.680 
tighter between a steel blade and the
movable<00:04:15.410> blade<00:04:15.700> okay<00:04:16.700> I<00:04:16.880> mean<00:04:17.150> this<00:04:17.299> is<00:04:17.480> one

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
movable blade okay I mean this is one

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.539 
movable blade okay I mean this is one
simple<00:04:17.959> method<00:04:18.200> I've<00:04:18.590> seen<00:04:18.890> another<00:04:19.130> Method

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
simple method I've seen another Method

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.510 
simple method I've seen another Method
Man<00:04:19.760> where<00:04:20.200> earlier<00:04:21.200> a<00:04:21.290> guy<00:04:21.650> actually<00:04:22.340> took

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
Man where earlier a guy actually took

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.810 
Man where earlier a guy actually took
off<00:04:23.320> let<00:04:24.320> me<00:04:24.350> let<00:04:24.710> me<00:04:24.740> get<00:04:25.220> something<00:04:25.610> where<00:04:25.789> I

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
off let me let me get something where I

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.090 
off let me let me get something where I
can<00:04:25.940> point<00:04:26.240> with

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
can point with

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:34.490 
can point with
the<00:04:29.100> guy<00:04:29.250> actually<00:04:32.300> he<00:04:33.300> took<00:04:33.600> this<00:04:33.870> metal<00:04:34.260> clip

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
the guy actually he took this metal clip

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.370 
the guy actually he took this metal clip
off<00:04:34.710> right<00:04:34.980> here<00:04:35.190> it<00:04:35.370> goes<00:04:35.550> around<00:04:35.880> there<00:04:36.380> and

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
off right here it goes around there and

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
screws but he cut out the bottom so he

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.340 
screws but he cut out the bottom so he
was<00:04:44.370> able<00:04:44.520> to<00:04:44.700> adjust<00:04:45.120> he<00:04:45.690> cut<00:04:45.870> the<00:04:45.990> bottoms

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 
we see a difference between the gap BAM

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.300 
we see a difference between the gap BAM
see<00:05:55.710> how<00:05:55.800> that<00:05:55.890> looks

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310
