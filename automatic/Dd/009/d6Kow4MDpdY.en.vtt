00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
this basically will help it to stay on

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.290

longer not crease and the colors will be

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:34.160 
longer not crease and the colors will be
more<00:00:24.480> vibrant<00:00:32.210> if<00:00:33.210> you<00:00:33.450> don't<00:00:33.660> already<00:00:33.870> use<00:00:34.020> a

more vibrant if you don't already use a
base<00:00:34.440> I<00:00:34.680> would<00:00:34.739> definitely<00:00:35.280> go<00:00:35.370> out<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.520> get

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760
