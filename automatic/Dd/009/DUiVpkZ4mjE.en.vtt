00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:16.950
 old floor did not see liked love 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.770

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.900
 and we're going to have a really nice chat 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.820

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.060
 said a lot of things for us that 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.759
 Can people see which shed that case? 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.720
 structure that behaves well 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:34.040
 great 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.680
 a series at last is little pink green 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.930
 more pop nelson nelson sergeant 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.410
 I think you'll like that because 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:47.360
 she promises to surprise the car that 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.360
 it will reach 12 meters and 30 meters 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:56.809
 Are you sir and believe in your car? 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.809
 dancing lost love 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:04.830
 When you talk about Nelson Sergeant, you have 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.549
 his person has his work is that 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.869
 The way you're going to put it is 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:11.820
 practically speaking in terms of 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.060
 fantasy material 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.130
 school proposal is honor it is 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.430
 finally his 90 years 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:25.820
 offering flowers there and making life 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.820
 cut of his musical and artistic life 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:37.730
 the sergeant refined talent in the 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.550
 recipe 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:42.530
 you've come since 11 of a season 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.900
 praised in command 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.280
 and now here in the belford purple direction 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.560
 Do you worry about leaving your 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.580
 signature or you leave me more 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:55.850
 Rise is everything carnival he seeks 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:58.130
 identity is professional as large 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.530
 I swear to medallions, I swear, right? 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:04.190
 maxi lopez polo alexandre louzada 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.200
 fall down here is telling you right 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.940
 it also comes from a crop of new 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.850
 carnival and now it's 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.310
 consolidating a great friend I am 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.350
 student of alexandre louzada who has a 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.260
 style partezan, right? 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:21.470
 so I see the carnival very well finished 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:25.490
 and I'm working on the following 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.560
 methodology the bamboo where I showed 2014 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.150
 I took the school on 11th 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.070
 Thank god with everyone's help. 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.870
 get her fifth 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.350
 I think it's an honorable position for anyone 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.350
 debut 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:41.360
 I believe that I will follow the same 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.760
 well-lined cars methodology well 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.290
 finished working the chromatic 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.520
 This is very important. 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:52.100
 is clever wings and allegories and 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:54.230
 finishing with a more signed brightness 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.560
 loaded because we do not have time 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:00.709
 for this and I think the carnival already 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:04.220
 has taken a proportion of how much less 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:06.440
 It's better but do not pull poor, huh? 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.420
 depart wisely 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:12.190
 but it's an exquisite thing to march like this 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.190
 lightweight 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.210
 after all it 's not cuba 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:23.240
 this year the honoree is the sergeant 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:25.860
 great sambistas is everyone loves is 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.360
 that she is a person who is alive and I 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.730
 I think it's an interesting detail to 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.030
 people who are now have up to 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.370
 the number of schools that have 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.750
 honoring living people does not do that 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.410
 all the difference right? 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.360
 It sure is the school proposal was 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.930
 make a story honoring this great 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:49.710
 mardi gras icon nÃ© and culture 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:53.490
 and pay homage to a 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:55.980
 way is special in life, because it is 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:57.750
 very important you make a great 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.420
 homage to a great man a great 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:04.350
 personality in life 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:06.240
 so he is innocent with a tractor for 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:09.240
 contribute to the development of this fear 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.370
 not easy storyline to develop not 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:15.570
 It was nothing good, it was not easy. 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:19.200
 We need to develop 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:22.140
 Nelson next door to his son and 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.630
 wife so he could always be in 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:27.300
 providing information for the 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.130
 development of the plot because when 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.960
 There's talk of a sergeant, we do not talk about 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.900
 anyone with any character 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:37.740
 who is talking about a man who is capable 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:41.940
 culturally very important for all 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:45.120
 Brazilian culture and what it is is a 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:47.640
 responsibility to take to 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.770
 avenue all its history 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:52.350
 So I told you when you can not see that 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:55.110
 attack that it was very important that we 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:57.840
 to see how we develop the carnival 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:02.700
 with his eyes because then there 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:03.660
 we would be translating is with all emotion 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:07.370
 the truth 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.370
 continuing its history flowers 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.220
 to help my piracy
