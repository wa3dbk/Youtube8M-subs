00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:06.180
 in the greater part of the average age the 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.990
 wars were made with spears spears 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.990
 and flash 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:19.670
 but from the 14th century came an invention in 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:22.010
 europe that would change all that there are 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.619
 first weapons in Europe were thus 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:27.410
 they were this size in fact this is a 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:29.420
 replica of a weapon today launches the weapon 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.730
 oldest excavated archaeologically 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.920
 in Europe 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.110
 may not seem like much but this 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.320
 weapon was a turnaround in the war 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:42.110
 can demonstrate this for me 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.610
 the weapons and extortion specialist is 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.489
 helping me load the 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.350
 The surprising thing about the first weapon is that 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:51.260
 she did not throw a cannonball 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:54.379
 the first ammunition that was used was 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.480
 this an arrow and if you stop to think 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:58.670
 this is not so surprising because 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.290
 You've never seen a cannonball through 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.790
 who would think of her as the first 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:08.400
 punishment to be used 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:11.180
 I use the hammer to make sure that 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.180
 it's good 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.679
 the bearers were not 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.840
 considered gentlemen 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:27.210
 he was threatened that if they were 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.049
 captured would have their hands cut in 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.500
 your eyes are drawn right let's stop 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.500
 come on 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.899
 only one chance the arrow broke in 

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:49.240
 some place on land 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:51.820
 she danced danced the force of the impact 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.399
 broke it 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.200
 one of the oldest weapons records 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.689
 being used on the battlefield in the 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.979
 Europe was when the British the 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:04.090
 brought to contain the forces 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.470
 in the battle decreases 1,346 to 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.750
 threatening explosion 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:11.610
 the sulfurous smell of the flame that was 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.610
 spat spread the enemy 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.870
 a chronicle of the time said they did 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.580
 a noise like thunder and caused 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.580
 many losses between men and horses 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:36.680
 the whole historical period had ideas that 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:39.230
 ideas that have disappeared since the 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.959
 beginning the weapon was destined to 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.180
 success in 50 years from the 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.340
 primitive weapons the gunsmiths 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.900
 mediated the construction of weapons 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.989
 they looked a lot like the cannons that 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.520
 we met today 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:54.410
 one of the first things was that they 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.280
 freed from flash went to bullet 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.989
 cannon 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.720
 the first cannonballs were stones 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.310
 so they were carved by craftsmen 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.130
 because we had not yet discovered 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:07.700
 European cast iron only discovered 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.410
 cast iron at the end of the 15th century 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.630
 another thing that happened was that they 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.790
 left for longer barrels 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.550
 but how to make a long barrel of iron 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:20.150
 without being able to make cast iron 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:22.700
 response was pay attention using the 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.730
 technology of a barrel 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.100
 you are seeing these tracks in the barrio 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.220
 strips of wood that are bonded by 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:34.130
 those hoops are what's going on here 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:37.220
 below these rings are bands of 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:40.790
 together form a core 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.709
 of round wood and then these rings 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.920
 with their long years they are hammered 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:48.380
 over it the wood core is burned 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.780
 and you have the barrel of the gun he calls himself 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.200
 because the same technology as a 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.200
 barrel 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.690
 This is what looks like a mug of 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.790
 beer flame brewing what goes 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:05.329
 happen is that the cannonball goes 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:07.850
 here the gunpowder goes in the breech now he 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:10.730
 will put the senator there placing a 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:13.750
 wooden cap and this will push the 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.750
 bullet in the barrel 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:18.780
 shooting 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:27.100
 It's done, money's collapsed now. 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.500
 he is ready to fire again 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.620
 while this is recharging my 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.690
 work is to clean with this scrub 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.580
 wet can have faults the guide does not want 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.530
 put gunpowder alive until these 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:45.520
 needles one off and it's ready 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:50.610
 to be carried off and here goes 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:55.620
 they berg and then gang and then berg 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.620
 the era of artillery has arrived 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:04.100
 the appearance of amraa was one of the signs 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.180
 of which the medieval period was 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.520
 ending 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:11.500
 changed the course of war and 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.500
 civilization forever
