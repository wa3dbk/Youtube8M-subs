my favorite Creek boat that I've paddled

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.930 
my favorite Creek boat that I've paddled
and<00:00:15.020> been<00:00:16.020> a<00:00:16.049> part<00:00:16.110> of<00:00:16.580> developing<00:00:17.580> in<00:00:17.730> some

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
and been a part of developing in some

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.580 
and been a part of developing in some
former<00:00:18.300> fashion<00:00:18.480> it<00:00:18.780> was<00:00:18.869> designed<00:00:19.199> by<00:00:19.289> Johnny

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
former fashion it was designed by Johnny

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.460 
former fashion it was designed by Johnny
Kern<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:20.220> then<00:00:20.400> myself<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:22.019> whole<00:00:22.199> crew

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
Kern and then myself and the whole crew

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.400 
Kern and then myself and the whole crew
a<00:00:22.529> really<00:00:22.920> crazy<00:00:23.490> paddlers<00:00:24.089> got<00:00:24.330> to<00:00:24.480> test<00:00:25.289> it

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
a really crazy paddlers got to test it

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.999 
a really crazy paddlers got to test it
on<00:00:25.560> just<00:00:26.310> about<00:00:26.490> every<00:00:27.179> major<00:00:27.740> classified<00:00:28.740> run

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:29.009 
on just about every major classified run

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:31.400 
on just about every major classified run
in<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.310> Western<00:00:29.609> Hemisphere<00:00:30.289> which<00:00:31.289> we

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
in the Western Hemisphere which we

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.990 
in the Western Hemisphere which we
thoroughly<00:00:31.619> enjoyed<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.340> out<00:00:32.490> of<00:00:32.640> that<00:00:32.730> the

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
thoroughly enjoyed and out of that the

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.200 
thoroughly enjoyed and out of that the
jefe<00:00:33.300> was<00:00:33.480> born<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.440> I<00:00:34.680> believe<00:00:34.980> that<00:00:35.340> it

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
jefe was born and I believe that it

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.450 
jefe was born and I believe that it
really<00:00:36.420> sets<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.990> benchmark<00:00:37.200> of<00:00:37.860> the

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
really sets the benchmark of the

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.570 
really sets the benchmark of the
modern-day<00:00:38.850> creeper<00:00:39.420> design<00:00:40.070> so<00:00:41.070> the<00:00:41.160> jefe<00:00:41.460> is

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:41.580 
modern-day creeper design so the jefe is

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.750 
modern-day creeper design so the jefe is
the<00:00:41.700> stuff<00:00:41.970> it's<00:00:42.390> what<00:00:42.600> you<00:00:42.720> want<00:00:43.640> you<00:00:44.640> know

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
the stuff it's what you want you know

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.280 
the stuff it's what you want you know
when<00:00:44.910> you're<00:00:45.060> in<00:00:45.150> the<00:00:45.210> pit<00:00:45.420> this<00:00:46.020> stuff's

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290 
when you're in the pit this stuff's

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.010 
when you're in the pit this stuff's
going<00:00:46.500> down<00:00:46.770> but<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.550> 2008<00:00:48.180> season<00:00:48.450> liquid

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
going down but the 2008 season liquid

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.130 
going down but the 2008 season liquid
logic<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.470> going<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.680> expand<00:00:50.130> this<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:51.140> bring

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
logic is going to expand this to bring

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.260 
logic is going to expand this to bring
