how to well what kind of printer i use
sprint<00:01:03.149> up<00:01:03.210> my<00:01:03.329> transparencies<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.290> so<00:01:04.439> you

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
sprint up my transparencies and so you

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.440 
sprint up my transparencies and so you
can<00:01:05.010> see<00:01:05.159> here<00:01:05.369> it's<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:05.549> same<00:01:05.729> design<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.090> just

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
can see here it's the same design I just

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.500 
can see here it's the same design I just
put<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.720> out<00:01:07.040> so<00:01:08.040> I'm<00:01:08.610> using<00:01:08.760> that<00:01:08.909> design<00:01:09.180> I'm

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
put it out so I'm using that design I'm

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.510 
put it out so I'm using that design I'm
putting<00:01:09.780> likes<00:01:10.080> my<00:01:10.560> test<00:01:10.890> strip<00:01:11.250> on<00:01:11.460> the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
putting likes my test strip on the

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.429 
putting likes my test strip on the
exposure<00:01:12.180> board<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.630> then<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:12.780> transparency

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
exposure board that then I transparency

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.649 
exposure board that then I transparency
on<00:01:13.560> top<00:01:13.799> and<00:01:14.460> now<00:01:14.610> i'm<00:01:14.790> clipping<00:01:15.030> down<00:01:15.360> my

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
on top and now i'm clipping down my

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.890 
on top and now i'm clipping down my
exposure<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.229> it

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.030 

right<00:01:22.900> now<00:01:23.080> that<00:01:23.200> I<00:01:23.260> have<00:01:23.380> everything<00:01:23.620> set<00:01:23.980> up

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:24.040 
right now that I have everything set up

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.890 
right now that I have everything set up
with<00:01:24.190> my<00:01:24.280> exposure<00:01:24.550> board<00:01:24.880> and<00:01:25.120> I<00:01:25.180> said<00:01:25.360> 108

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
with my exposure board and I said 108

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.920 
with my exposure board and I said 108
the<00:01:26.050> light<00:01:26.230> source<00:01:26.440> and<00:01:26.770> turn<00:01:27.250> it<00:01:27.340> on<00:01:27.460> and<00:01:27.930> this

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
the light source and turn it on and this

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.930 
the light source and turn it on and this
experiment<00:01:29.560> i'm<00:01:29.650> going<00:01:29.800> to<00:01:29.860> go<00:01:30.190> for<00:01:30.520> 15

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
experiment i'm going to go for 15

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.550 
experiment i'm going to go for 15
minutes<00:01:31.120> i'm<00:01:31.390> going<00:01:31.600> to<00:01:31.690> see<00:01:31.840> if<00:01:31.870> 15<00:01:32.290> minutes

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
minutes i'm going to see if 15 minutes

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.610 
minutes i'm going to see if 15 minutes
is<00:01:32.680> long<00:01:32.710> enough<00:01:32.890> to<00:01:33.820> expose<00:01:34.330> this<00:01:34.750> test<00:01:35.320> strip

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.620 
is long enough to expose this test strip

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.370 
is long enough to expose this test strip
so<00:01:36.340> i'm<00:01:36.430> setting<00:01:36.730> my<00:01:36.850> alarm<00:01:37.120> for<00:01:37.450> 15<00:01:38.440> minutes

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
so i'm setting my alarm for 15 minutes

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.910 
so i'm setting my alarm for 15 minutes
and<00:01:42.330> then<00:01:43.330> you<00:01:43.450> can<00:01:43.600> see<00:01:43.810> here<00:01:44.200> is<00:01:44.500> exposing

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
and then you can see here is exposing

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.920 
and then you can see here is exposing
leave<00:01:45.460> it<00:01:45.610> Emily<00:01:45.940> to<00:01:46.000> here<00:01:46.150> for<00:01:46.300> 50<00:01:46.570> minutes<00:01:46.750> so

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
leave it Emily to here for 50 minutes so

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.660 
leave it Emily to here for 50 minutes so
you<00:01:46.990> can<00:01:47.140> see<00:01:47.320> it<00:01:47.440> just<00:01:47.650> sitting<00:01:48.460> underneath

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
you can see it just sitting underneath

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:58.090 
you can see it just sitting underneath
the<00:01:48.820> light<00:01:49.000> switch

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.730 

alright<00:01:58.790> spend<00:01:59.119> 15<00:01:59.479> minutes<00:01:59.510> it's<00:02:00.409> my<00:02:00.560> turn

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
alright spend 15 minutes it's my turn

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.679 
alright spend 15 minutes it's my turn
off<00:02:00.830> my<00:02:00.979> light<00:02:01.009> source<00:02:01.460> and<00:02:01.790> then<00:02:02.420> I'm<00:02:02.540> going

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
off my light source and then I'm going

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:07.120 
off my light source and then I'm going
to<00:02:02.750> remove<00:02:03.049> my<00:02:03.290> test<00:02:03.650> strip<00:02:05.890> from<00:02:06.890> the

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
to remove my test strip from the

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.220 
to remove my test strip from the
exposure<00:02:07.490> board<00:02:07.820> and<00:02:09.160> then<00:02:10.750> once<00:02:11.750> I<00:02:11.870> have<00:02:12.080> done

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
exposure board and then once I have done

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.470 
exposure board and then once I have done
that<00:02:12.470> I<00:02:12.680> need<00:02:12.920> to<00:02:12.950> let<00:02:13.160> it<00:02:13.400> sit<00:02:13.760> in<00:02:13.790> water<00:02:14.330> for

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
that I need to let it sit in water for

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.930 
that I need to let it sit in water for
about<00:02:14.720> 30<00:02:15.200> minutes<00:02:15.440> so<00:02:15.770> I<00:02:16.250> have<00:02:16.370> my<00:02:16.489> water<00:02:16.670> set

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
about 30 minutes so I have my water set

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.510 
about 30 minutes so I have my water set
up<00:02:17.030> already<00:02:17.180> another<00:02:17.540> sit<00:02:17.930> here<00:02:18.220> for<00:02:19.220> 30

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
up already another sit here for 30

up already another sit here for 30
minutes<00:02:19.760> what<00:02:20.600> it's<00:02:20.750> been<00:02:20.930> soaking<00:02:21.170> for<00:02:21.319> 30

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
minutes what it's been soaking for 30

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.740 
minutes what it's been soaking for 30
minutes<00:02:21.770> I'm<00:02:22.100> going<00:02:22.280> to<00:02:22.370> rinse<00:02:22.610> it<00:02:22.790> out<00:02:22.880> so<00:02:23.720> you

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
minutes I'm going to rinse it out so you

minutes I'm going to rinse it out so you
can<00:02:23.870> see<00:02:24.050> here<00:02:24.260> what<00:02:24.470> it<00:02:24.530> looks<00:02:24.680> like<00:02:24.890> you<00:02:25.100> can

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
can see here what it looks like you can

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.280 
can see here what it looks like you can
see<00:02:25.340> the<00:02:25.430> light<00:02:25.580> blue<00:02:25.880> is<00:02:26.090> where<00:02:26.270> my<00:02:26.959> design

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
see the light blue is where my design

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.890 
see the light blue is where my design
was<00:02:27.530> is<00:02:27.770> blocking<00:02:28.160> out<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.310> light<00:02:28.430> and<00:02:28.900> now

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
was is blocking out the light and now

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.600 
was is blocking out the light and now
i'm<00:02:30.170> going<00:02:30.290> to<00:02:30.380> hold<00:02:30.530> it<00:02:30.709> under<00:02:30.920> water<00:02:31.130> to<00:02:31.400> wash

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
i'm going to hold it under water to wash

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.850 
i'm going to hold it under water to wash
away<00:02:31.640> all<00:02:32.330> that<00:02:32.660> emulsion<00:02:33.260> that<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:36.530> design

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
away all that emulsion that the design

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.610 
away all that emulsion that the design
was<00:02:36.890> in<00:02:37.220> so<00:02:37.790> here<00:02:38.030> it<00:02:38.090> is<00:02:38.150> i'm<00:02:38.500> brings<00:02:39.500> me

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
was in so here it is i'm brings me

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.960 
was in so here it is i'm brings me
underwater<00:02:39.950> and<00:02:40.370> sometimes<00:02:40.700> when<00:02:40.880> the

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
underwater and sometimes when the

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.100 
underwater and sometimes when the
emulsion<00:02:41.300> has<00:02:41.330> been<00:02:41.540> really<00:02:41.720> stubborn<00:02:41.930> and

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
emulsion has been really stubborn and

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.600 
emulsion has been really stubborn and
won't<00:02:42.200> come<00:02:42.319> out<00:02:42.590> i<00:02:42.860> just<00:02:43.100> use<00:02:43.250> a<00:02:43.280> paintbrush

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
won't come out i just use a paintbrush

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.240 
won't come out i just use a paintbrush
to<00:02:44.269> get<00:02:44.390> it<00:02:44.510> started<00:02:44.720> my<00:02:45.650> bed<00:02:45.860> should<00:02:46.069> come<00:02:46.220> out

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
to get it started my bed should come out

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.509 
to get it started my bed should come out
real<00:02:46.580> easy<00:02:46.840> if<00:02:47.840> you<00:02:47.989> have<00:02:48.170> really<00:02:48.709> older<00:02:49.220> you

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
real easy if you have really older you

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.729 
real easy if you have really older you
hadn't<00:02:50.060> used<00:02:50.269> your<00:02:50.660> screen<00:02:51.110> in<00:02:51.230> a<00:02:51.290> while<00:02:51.470> then

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
hadn't used your screen in a while then

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.140 
hadn't used your screen in a while then
it<00:02:51.860> might<00:02:51.950> be<00:02:52.069> kind<00:02:52.280> of<00:02:52.310> stubborn<00:02:52.519> you<00:02:52.910> need<00:02:53.030> to

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
it might be kind of stubborn you need to

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.360 
it might be kind of stubborn you need to
use<00:02:53.299> the<00:02:53.480> paintbrush<00:02:53.810> to<00:02:54.350> feel<00:02:54.890> the<00:02:55.040> emotion

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
use the paintbrush to feel the emotion

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.500 
use the paintbrush to feel the emotion
out<00:02:55.459> but<00:02:55.790> it<00:02:55.880> should<00:02:56.000> come<00:02:56.150> out<00:02:56.209> pretty<00:02:56.360> well

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
out but it should come out pretty well

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.440 
out but it should come out pretty well
just<00:02:56.870> rinse<00:02:57.230> it<00:02:57.260> under<00:02:57.350> water<00:02:57.650> and<00:02:58.239> you<00:02:59.239> see

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
just rinse it under water and you see

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.949 
just rinse it under water and you see
here<00:02:59.660> after<00:02:59.870> I've<00:02:59.959> rinsed<00:03:00.110> it<00:03:00.319> out<00:03:01.959> here's

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
here after I've rinsed it out here's

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.620 
here after I've rinsed it out here's
what<00:03:03.110> it<00:03:03.200> looks<00:03:03.380> like<00:03:03.560> I<00:03:03.860> had<00:03:04.280> my<00:03:04.310> screen<00:03:04.820> with

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
what it looks like I had my screen with

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.600 
what it looks like I had my screen with
the<00:03:05.660> emulsion<00:03:06.140> on<00:03:06.230> it<00:03:06.760> so<00:03:08.890> there<00:03:09.890> we<00:03:09.980> go<00:03:10.010> didn't

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
the emulsion on it so there we go didn't

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.610 
the emulsion on it so there we go didn't
see<00:03:10.730> either<00:03:10.850> so<00:03:11.720> 15<00:03:12.019> minutes<00:03:12.260> was<00:03:12.350> a<00:03:12.380> good

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
see either so 15 minutes was a good

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.620 
see either so 15 minutes was a good
amount<00:03:12.890> of<00:03:12.980> time<00:03:13.220> this<00:03:14.120> would<00:03:14.269> be<00:03:14.359> a<00:03:14.390> perfect

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
amount of time this would be a perfect

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.949 
amount of time this would be a perfect
at<00:03:14.870> that<00:03:14.989> time<00:03:15.260> for<00:03:15.590> this<00:03:15.709> source<00:03:15.950> so<00:03:16.959> I'm

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
at that time for this source so I'm

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:19.210 
at that time for this source so I'm
going<00:03:18.170> to<00:03:18.200> go<00:03:18.290> ahead<00:03:18.320> and<00:03:18.440> expose<00:03:18.769> my<00:03:18.950> full

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
going to go ahead and expose my full

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.580 
going to go ahead and expose my full
sheet<00:03:19.519> I'm<00:03:20.450> actually<00:03:20.660> using<00:03:20.930> this<00:03:21.170> design<00:03:21.470> in

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590 
sheet I'm actually using this design in

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:23.500 
sheet I'm actually using this design in
another<00:03:21.829> project<00:03:22.130> that<00:03:22.370> the<00:03:22.820> coming<00:03:23.090> up<00:03:23.180> video

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
another project that the coming up video

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.740 
another project that the coming up video
so<00:03:24.290> I'm<00:03:24.709> going<00:03:24.859> to<00:03:24.890> go<00:03:24.980> ahead<00:03:25.040> and<00:03:25.130> make<00:03:25.370> my

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
so I'm going to go ahead and make my

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.360 
so I'm going to go ahead and make my
cheap<00:03:26.750> for<00:03:26.959> that<00:03:27.109> palm<00:03:27.829> you<00:03:27.980> can<00:03:28.130> see<00:03:28.250> my

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
cheap for that palm you can see my

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.670 
cheap for that palm you can see my
transparencies<00:03:28.970> come<00:03:29.209> with<00:03:29.390> that<00:03:29.570> white<00:03:30.320> tab

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
transparencies come with that white tab

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.620 
transparencies come with that white tab
up<00:03:30.920> top<00:03:30.950> it's<00:03:31.549> best<00:03:31.850> to<00:03:32.000> go<00:03:32.030> ahead<00:03:32.120> and<00:03:32.329> cut<00:03:32.359> the

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:32.630 
up top it's best to go ahead and cut the

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.990 
up top it's best to go ahead and cut the
hall<00:03:32.810> so<00:03:33.200> interfere<00:03:33.859> with<00:03:34.010> your<00:03:34.160> exposing<00:03:34.760> new

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
hall so interfere with your exposing new

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.620 
hall so interfere with your exposing new
sheet<00:03:35.829> cut<00:03:36.829> that<00:03:36.980> off<00:03:37.040> I<00:03:37.489> put<00:03:38.150> my<00:03:38.269> design<00:03:38.480> on

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
sheet cut that off I put my design on

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.320 
sheet cut that off I put my design on
the<00:03:39.310> easy<00:03:40.310> screen<00:03:41.060> print<00:03:41.299> sheet

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
the easy screen print sheet

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.540 
the easy screen print sheet
put<00:03:43.020> it<00:03:43.110> on<00:03:43.200> the<00:03:43.320> exposure<00:03:43.680> would<00:03:46.430> put<00:03:47.430> the

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:47.550 
put it on the exposure would put the

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:53.620 
put it on the exposure would put the
piece<00:03:47.730> of<00:03:47.880> glass<00:03:48.060> on<00:03:48.360> and<00:03:49.110> then<00:03:49.470> clamp<00:03:49.770> it<00:03:49.920> down

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.330 

and<00:03:54.630> then<00:03:54.690> let's<00:03:54.870> just<00:03:54.990> set<00:03:55.260> up<00:03:55.380> I<00:03:55.620> will<00:03:56.130> turn

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
and then let's just set up I will turn

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.070 
and then let's just set up I will turn
it<00:03:56.400> on<00:03:56.610> and<00:03:56.850> leave<00:03:57.000> it<00:03:57.030> sit<00:03:57.270> there<00:03:57.300> for<00:03:57.480> 15
