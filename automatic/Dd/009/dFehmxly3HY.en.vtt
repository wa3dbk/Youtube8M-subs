if you're going to do a lot of
high-volume<00:02:18.590> vacuum<00:02:19.310> packing<00:02:19.700> then<00:02:20.120> you

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
high-volume vacuum packing then you

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.030 
high-volume vacuum packing then you
probably<00:02:20.600> want<00:02:21.050> what<00:02:21.380> I<00:02:21.410> have<00:02:21.709> which<00:02:21.890> is<00:02:21.920> a

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
commercial one if you're going to do low

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.800 
commercial one if you're going to do low
volume<00:02:24.739> then<00:02:25.340> the<00:02:25.670> smaller<00:02:26.209> ones<00:02:26.480> like<00:02:26.600> the

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
volume then the smaller ones like the

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.470 
volume then the smaller ones like the
FoodSaver<00:02:27.380> or<00:02:27.980> what-have-you<00:02:28.730> those<00:02:29.300> are

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
FoodSaver or what-have-you those are

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.170 
FoodSaver or what-have-you those are
fine<00:02:29.780> but<00:02:30.530> if<00:02:31.220> you<00:02:31.430> really<00:02:31.670> want<00:02:31.970> to<00:02:32.060> invest

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
fine but if you really want to invest

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.160 
fine but if you really want to invest
into<00:02:32.600> something<00:02:33.080> I<00:02:33.910> having<00:02:34.910> a<00:02:35.000> good<00:02:35.209> deck<00:02:35.989> and

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
into something I having a good deck and

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.600 
into something I having a good deck and
packer<00:02:36.380> I<00:02:36.530> think<00:02:36.890> as<00:02:37.010> well<00:02:37.250> worth<00:02:37.430> the<00:02:37.580> money

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
packer I think as well worth the money

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.130 
packer I think as well worth the money
because<00:02:38.030> there's<00:02:38.300> so<00:02:38.450> many<00:02:38.540> other<00:02:38.720> things<00:02:38.840> you

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
because there's so many other things you

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.810 
because there's so many other things you
can<00:02:39.320> do<00:02:39.500> with<00:02:39.800> the<00:02:39.920> advantage<00:02:40.250> of<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.430> Packers

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
can do with the advantage of the Packers

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.590 
can do with the advantage of the Packers
so<00:02:41.060> I<00:02:41.300> have<00:02:41.810> that<00:02:42.019> one<00:02:42.670> as<00:02:43.670> far<00:02:43.970> as<00:02:44.120> my<00:02:44.300> meat

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
so I have that one as far as my meat

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.100 
so I have that one as far as my meat
slicer<00:02:45.110> is<00:02:45.200> concerned<00:02:45.739> I<00:02:45.980> have<00:02:46.519> a<00:02:47.090> meat<00:02:47.930> slicer
