 [Music] 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.340
 or not 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.670
 I think it's a lot of important light 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.190
 hello javi friends we are already in 2014 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.080
 although better than starting with recycling 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.730
 that's why this week I'm going to 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.860
 teach how to make a folder that goes to 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.600
 serve to keep all your works 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.940
 your drawings or whatever you want to save in 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.580
 he is a folder that is based on 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.770
 cardboard and some other little things that 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.510
 we can find very very easy 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.280
 before I start with the video I invite you 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.870
 to subscribe here below in the 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.430
 little red button that says subscribe 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.379
 because every Thursday we bring you a 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.600
 very very easy craft that can you 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.960
 like now, let's start with the 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.960
 tutorial 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.970
 The materials that we are going to use is 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.770
 A carton 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:06.320
 liquid glue a ribbon 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:11.510
 a drilling machine 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:13.840
 a ruler a pencil or a pen paintings 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.840
 acrylic 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.650
 the jobs that you are going to put in 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.850
 from your folder we will also use 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.850
 a cutter 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.870
 our scissors 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.850
 and finally we are going to use a 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:37.050
 cardboard 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:39.390
 [Music] 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.950
 let's take our cardboard and we will 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.279
 make a mark at 48 centimeters 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.279
 [Music] 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.310
 and wide we are going to make a mark to the 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.020
 30 centimeters 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.640
 [Music] 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.310
 then we will have a rectangle of 30 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.580
 centimeters wide by 48 centimeters 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.580
 long 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.540
 cut surplus 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.490
 [Applause] 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.320
 now let's measure in the part of 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.540
 above you will take your rule and go to 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.390
 make a mark at 23 centimeters 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.890
 then next we're going to make a mark 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.730
 at 2 centimeters 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.440
 then we will have these 2 points 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.940
 now these two points that we made in the 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.880
 part of the top we will do 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.430
 exactly the same at the bottom 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:32.950
 then we will stay like this now 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.260
 let's join these points with a line 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.210
 vertical if you realize this is going to be 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.830
 the spine of our folder 

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.830
 [Music] 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.930
 now let's pass a cutter on the 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.820
 lines that we just did and this is 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.330
 to give it flexibility when it comes to 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.330
 close it 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.060
 cut out two rectangles of 22 points 5 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.950
 centimeters wide x 30 centimeters 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.620
 long that these are going to be the caps of 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.989
 our folder this we are going to put 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.879
 one in front and the other on the part of 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.890
 back if you realize this is going to be 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:08.990
 so that it gives more rigidity and more strength 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.900
 to our folder 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:14.600
 with enough glue so that this one does not 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.430
 is going to come off and good press a 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.620
 little with your hands so they stick 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.340
 very very good and good what are you going to do with 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.340
 the back 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.610
 now you are going to cut two strips of 30 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.670
 centimeters long by 2 centimeters 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.050
 Wide 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.050
 [Music] 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.590
 take one of them and well let's mark 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:42.410
 to four centimeters and then we go 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.660
 to mark the two centimeters now if 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.620
 you want you can move your rule and we're going to 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:50.620
 mark at eight centimeters 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:53.370
 then we will mark again the 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.370
 two centimeters 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.120
 and then we will mark again at 8 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.120
 centimeters 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:05.349
 and finally we will mark the 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:07.420
 two centimeters and good these points the 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:09.840
 we are going to transform them into lines 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.840
 vertical 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:16.110
 if you realize you are going to be three 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.970
 squares 1 2 and 3 then these me the 

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:20.700
 I'll scratch so you know not the 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.540
 let's use then let's 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:30.340
 cut them out 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:32.530
 [Music] 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.110
 then you will have two rectangles 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:38.260
 of eight centimeters and two rectangles 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.690
 small ones of 4 centimeters then we're going 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:43.000
 to take a small one of 4 centimeters and 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:45.040
 we are going to stick it where we did the tenderloin 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.810
 of our book we are going to stick it in the 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.370
 bottom part then let's make a 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:51.040
 Mark with our rule at 2 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:53.229
 centimeters and we're going to stick a long one of 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.870
 8 centimeters from the line 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:58.270
 then we make a brand again 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:01.360
 the 2 centimeters with our rule and 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:03.430
 let's paste from there another long 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.020
 8 centimeters 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.880
 we return to make a mark at 2 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.850
 centimeters with our rule and by 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:12.330
 last we are going to paste the rectangle of 4 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.330
 centimeters 

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:19.009
 now if you can see how high you are 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:21.770
 to do the perforations in your leaves 

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:24.800
 Now, I'm sorry for the strips that 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:27.159
 we paste and we're going to paste the other strip 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.159
 over 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:32.620
 now if you can tie the slats or 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:36.529
 with what you are going to hold their leaves 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.529
 [Music] 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.750
 the next step is to line your folder 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.970
 with a white card it is as if 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:47.059
 were a book commonly 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.059
 [Music] 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:51.979
 and 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.730
 Now you can paint it, I used it 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.860
 this pastel green but you can 

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:00.860
 use the one you want to put several 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.300
 layers to make it more uniform 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:06.199
 [Music] 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:11.120
 now only save your jobs 

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:11.120
 helping you with the slats and ready 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:22.150
 [Music] 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.500

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.270

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:32.980
 thing that I really liked is that a 

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:35.020
 little person sent me his photographs about 

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:38.490
 students from some schools that did 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:38.490
 the recycled reindeer 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.639
 and other people saw me their 

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:44.590
 photographs that I also liked 

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:48.250
 much much 

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:48.250
 [Music] 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.430

 to find in the description box 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.680
 is that I wanted to say is that they are 

00:06:59.789 --> 00:07:03.660
 losing a lot if they do not like 

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:06.210
 my social networks because recently 

00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:07.710
 we made a live video that lasted a lot 

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:09.930
 a long time but we were very 

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:12.780
 entertaining talking about everything 

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:15.120

00:07:37.349 --> 00:07:42.690
 to pass is that we are already 1800 that means 

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:43.800
