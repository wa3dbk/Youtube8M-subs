it's a uh it's the statistical

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.170 
it's a uh it's the statistical
possibility<00:03:50.460> so<00:03:50.640> that's<00:03:50.790> why<00:03:50.910> we're<00:03:51.090> doing

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
possibility so that's why we're doing

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.270 
possibility so that's why we're doing
the<00:03:51.390> list<00:03:51.600> well<00:03:51.810> two<00:03:52.020> things<00:03:52.260> number<00:03:52.470> one<00:03:52.710> yeah
