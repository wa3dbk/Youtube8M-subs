00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.310 

and<00:02:44.220> so<00:02:44.430> then<00:02:44.700> what<00:02:44.880> we<00:02:45.030> want<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.300> do<00:02:45.450> is<00:02:45.810> focus

on this right hand and so another it's

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.680 
on this right hand and so another it's
it's<00:02:51.630> another<00:02:51.870> basic<00:02:52.710> Travis<00:02:53.430> picking<00:02:53.700> kind

and<00:03:04.760> the<00:03:05.760> pattern<00:03:06.240> with<00:03:07.200> our<00:03:07.350> right<00:03:07.560> hand<00:03:07.860> is

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
and the pattern with our right hand is

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.520 
and the pattern with our right hand is
going<00:03:08.160> to<00:03:08.220> stay<00:03:08.460> the<00:03:08.610> same<00:03:08.640> for<00:03:09.090> this<00:03:09.150> whole

whole little intro so we've got this

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:44.179 
whole little intro so we've got this
then<00:03:41.219> thumb<00:03:42.000> on<00:03:42.299> the<00:03:42.450> D<00:03:42.719> and<00:03:43.170> I'm<00:03:43.769> using<00:03:44.069> my

00:03:44.179 --> 00:03:44.189 
then thumb on the D and I'm using my

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:48.170 
then thumb on the D and I'm using my
middle<00:03:44.609> on<00:03:45.469> the<00:03:46.469> G<00:03:47.099> you<00:03:47.400> could<00:03:47.579> use<00:03:47.730> your<00:03:47.849> index

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
middle on the G you could use your index

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:53.220 
middle on the G you could use your index
if<00:03:48.389> you<00:03:48.510> want<00:03:49.700> we've<00:03:50.700> got

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:04:10.250 

check<00:03:54.040> it<00:03:54.130> out<00:03:54.190> Han

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.729 

followed<00:04:11.220> by<00:04:11.250> the<00:04:11.879> a<00:04:11.910> and<00:04:12.510> the<00:04:12.720> B<00:04:12.930> and<00:04:13.230> I'm

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
followed by the a and the B and I'm

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.140 
followed by the a and the B and I'm
using<00:04:13.920> my<00:04:14.129> thumb<00:04:14.280> and<00:04:14.489> middle<00:04:14.580> finger<00:04:14.730> again

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
using my thumb and middle finger again

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.400 
using my thumb and middle finger again
so<00:04:15.269> we've<00:04:15.390> got<00:04:15.540> the<00:04:15.930> a<00:04:16.230> and<00:04:16.980> the<00:04:17.070> B<00:04:17.100> together

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
so we've got the a and the B together

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.260 
so we've got the a and the B together
followed<00:04:19.410> by<00:04:19.530> the<00:04:19.590> D<00:04:19.859> G

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.270 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.420 

then<00:04:22.780> the<00:04:22.960> a<00:04:22.990> be<00:04:23.500> separate

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
then the a be separate

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:26.740 
then the a be separate
when<00:04:25.940> you<00:04:26.000> put<00:04:26.180> it<00:04:26.270> together<00:04:26.389> it<00:04:26.570> looks<00:04:26.600> like

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
when you put it together it looks like

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:35.900 
when you put it together it looks like
this

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:44.830 

Oh

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.050 

two<00:04:45.840> more<00:04:46.020> notes<00:04:46.230> and<00:04:46.770> then<00:04:47.550> that's<00:04:47.730> the<00:04:47.910> whole

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
two more notes and then that's the whole

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.600 
two more notes and then that's the whole
pattern

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.070 

and<00:04:53.729> that<00:04:54.539> last<00:04:54.870> last<00:04:55.530> two<00:04:55.740> notes<00:04:56.030> RDG<00:04:57.080> got

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
and that last last two notes RDG got

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:58.990 
and that last last two notes RDG got
these<00:04:58.229> two<00:04:58.379> together

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
these two together

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:12.740 
these two together
d<00:05:00.000> G<00:05:00.300> a<00:05:01.280> B<00:05:02.280> separate<00:05:03.050> and<00:05:04.050> then<00:05:04.169> D<00:05:04.379> G

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:35.960 

Oh

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:35.970 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.380 

start<00:05:36.870> really<00:05:37.350> slow<00:05:37.620> and<00:05:37.950> then<00:05:38.270> you<00:05:39.270> know

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:39.390 
start really slow and then you know

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.270 
start really slow and then you know
eventually<00:05:39.600> speed<00:05:40.350> it<00:05:40.440> up<00:05:40.560> a<00:05:40.680> little<00:05:40.710> bit<00:05:41.070> at<00:05:41.190> a

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 
eventually speed it up a little bit at a

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.610 
eventually speed it up a little bit at a
time<00:05:41.310> and<00:05:41.820> then<00:05:42.720> we're<00:05:43.020> going<00:05:43.110> to<00:05:43.170> do<00:05:43.440> that

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
time and then we're going to do that

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.370 
time and then we're going to do that
finger<00:05:43.980> pattern<00:05:44.400> and<00:05:44.780> the<00:05:45.780> finger<00:05:46.020> pattern

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 
finger pattern and the finger pattern

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.910 
finger pattern and the finger pattern
that<00:05:47.040> we<00:05:47.190> learn<00:05:47.550> is<00:05:47.820> for<00:05:48.210> one<00:05:48.750> time<00:05:49.080> for<00:05:49.620> each

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:49.920 
that we learn is for one time for each

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:52.820 
that we learn is for one time for each
of<00:05:50.370> these<00:05:50.940> left<00:05:51.450> hand<00:05:51.660> chords<00:05:52.110> so<00:05:52.530> check<00:05:52.710> it

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
of these left hand chords so check it

00:05:52.830 --> 00:06:16.390 
of these left hand chords so check it
out

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.400 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.999 

you

00:06:18.999 --> 00:06:19.009 

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:33.050 

Oh

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:37.219 

Oh

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:37.229 

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:40.860 

so<00:06:38.229> it<00:06:38.319> starts<00:06:38.680> right<00:06:39.009> with<00:06:39.250> that<00:06:39.430> and<00:06:39.870> that

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:40.870 
so it starts right with that and that

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:44.460 
so it starts right with that and that
pattern<00:06:41.259> is<00:06:41.800> a<00:06:42.370> really<00:06:43.030> nice<00:06:43.240> pattern<00:06:43.539> to<00:06:44.319> know

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:44.470 
pattern is a really nice pattern to know

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:46.680 
pattern is a really nice pattern to know
it's<00:06:44.800> used<00:06:45.280> in<00:06:45.400> a<00:06:45.460> lot<00:06:45.490> of<00:06:45.759> other<00:06:45.880> songs<00:06:46.180> and
