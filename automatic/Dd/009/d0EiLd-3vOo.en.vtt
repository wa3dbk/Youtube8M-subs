00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:05.799
 Hello Friends Welcome to my channel 

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:10.699
 This time with another video, this is the starting point 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.400
 It will show you this time like a fishing net that contains lead 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.600
 We already have our leads ready to be placed in the tow rope 

00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:24.799
 Now we only lead 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.800
 We take Dalton 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:34.299
 And together with lead cord embrace 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.900
 I was thrown into the shape 

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:46.799
 So that it is a kind of ball 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:48.899
 Some also 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.899
 The lead distance to bullets must be the same 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:10.700
 I also remember that the rope where the presentations are placed 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.500
 Do not be too flexible because you have tangled problems 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.900
 It is best not too flexible 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:34.200
 The series has more lead range 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.400
 If you put one elastic you will have a tangled problem 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.100
 Because it will lead dominate the series 

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:45.899
 Which should be avoided 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.400
 We continue to place presentations 

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:57.699
 We became comfortable with this flat stone to give 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.700
 Shock and lead formation 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.699
 Good driving which is very flexible and easy to operate 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:18.800
 So we put leads in this way 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.800
 With a hammer hit a small 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.900
 It looked good 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.900
 Always keep an eye we grab 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.300
 With a rope 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.300
 And hit now 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.900
 Then we 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.900
 The Lost Eye Willy 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.400
 We grabbed the lead with the rope and hit 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.099
 So we have left a kind of ball 

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:13.899
 I have now met with the Union 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.900
 Rope 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.099
 That's why we chose a larger margin 

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:24.599
 I have already made a bigger difference 

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:28.000
 To embrace the two ropes 

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:36.899
 Well now that we have ready 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.900
 We hit with the hammer 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.900
 We hit really hard 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.900
 Now we begin to cut 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.900
 Cut here 

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:14.899
 Such as cutting the other end 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.000
 I have attached the cord and keep the rest 

00:04:27.399 --> 00:04:31.799
 Always taking the eye do not forget 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:51.000
 If you prefer more weight 

00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:57.799
 It can give more weight to one flimsy eye 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.100
 Remember that when we lift up to form a breast 

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:07.500
 Three were free diamonds 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.500
 Two of them put weights on and are free 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.500
 We finish with the threads placed 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.300
 They must be that way 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.300
 Lead to a unified command instead 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.300
 While friends arrived at the end point of this video 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 we 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.300
 Later videos and others 

00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:36.899
 So next time.
