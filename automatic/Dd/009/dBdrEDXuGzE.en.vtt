00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:33.070
 that you see the contents of the box and the 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:33.070
 product itself that is quite remarkable 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:41.220
 It is a simple product so no 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.750
 we will have to go with complying with 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.010
 cables 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.010
 nor with adapters 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:55.059
 that is, it is a plug-and-play product on 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:55.059
 content is a quick manual 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:01.240
 an advice they give us for the 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.660
 stretching of the beat band that is to say 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.660
 Diadem 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.990
 warranty 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:12.290
 from tech sio we go there with the 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.290
 headphones 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:20.960
 we see that it has magnificent finishes 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:25.040
 with a touch ruber on the outside and 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:27.770
 inside at any point we notice 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:31.760
 that there is outstanding plastic everything is 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:34.700
 very padded with a foam with memory 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:38.000
 so it will be much more comfortable to 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.670
 the long hours of play we see that what 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.540
 we can fold and hang them from the neck already 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:48.780
 who has the headphones here you speak 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:53.870
 we see the earmuffs finished in leather 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.870
 for total sound isolation 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.930
 we make the microphone that is 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.270
 the useful track is to say we can save it 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.640
 when we are not going to use it, it is 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.400
 flexible so it will adapt us 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:10.810
 totally to our needs and 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.810
 now let's see the connectors 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.810
 before seeing the connector we see the 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:22.210
 volume control 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:25.470
 and on and off the microphone 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:28.520
 we see that the cable is flat so 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.520
 it will be much more comfortable 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:34.910
 and we see that it is simply a yak that 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:38.740
 we have to connect in our command or 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:41.740
 in our smartphone mobile tablet 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.740
