00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:18.659
 nothing to do 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.640
 the 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:03.430
 l 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.420
 at 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.870
 at 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.590
 no 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.080
 at 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.570
 this session time was going on it's another level of reading 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.290
 this game if we have not been really present since the missed start 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.930
 very funny then I had a lot of the guests who followed that we got 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.739
 not put in the return match 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.170
 but we know that wallace said it's played on details tonight 

00:02:12.169 --> 00:02:13.559
 was not present 

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:16.409
 when my party a good part of the match and that's what he says what makes me 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:18.159
 hurts tonight now 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:21.930
 here the thing to remember is a set for the next game in the school 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.769
 calmette they are stable on the third third but it is surely what it takes 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.169
 hold back 

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:29.769
 what happened in this second third time mossialos 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.969
 I have the impression that we call the vase 

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:32.920
 for Slovaks 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.339
 2nd third they came to appreciate this time 

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:39.749
 nimes was a little jostled in attacked French have also 

00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:42.089
 a little bit the same thing they really closed the game investigation 

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:45.549
 we had very little spacing began a little bit these wonders 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:48.680
 oration profited from the penalties of not arriving because well played their 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.729
 game now that's it we turn the tide 

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:54.170
 we saw in the third third another swollen face 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.569
 the message we were waiting for today 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:57.410
 conquerors 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.379
 and we had never won this little regret project 0 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:04.329
 the second guy following me I think it would be strongly tonight the 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:06.569
 third which was much better than the first 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.609
 even if they relaxed a little bit on the end it's true but we saw 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:11.349
 we were still more present opinion 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:14.189
 we must take all that is positive tonight is really the third 

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:17.099
 third and then forget the rest really devoted 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:20.539
 if you lose 8 305 changes for the score to 10 to 7 

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:23.059
 important now this next match at bienne must we be ready to 

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:26.059
 departure and do not know what to expect 

00:03:27.149 --> 00:03:28.260
 for training 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.260
 a local leader early in the game the most important 

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:33.599
 of the same name 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.959
 but a lot of pressure on our elected 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:37.509
 we did not manage that well 

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:39.089
 the German club 

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:42.879
 the state on the puck all night the net pure impression 

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:47.529
 there was a little different problem this level tonight it shows 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.459
 that's what happened in the second third 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.189
 they concluded the source 

00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:54.050
 I like You 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.339
 specifically a sock the vote was done at the camp nou 

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:58.669
 36 

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:02.519
 who even brought a lot of pressure on us but this cancer 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:05.579
 every time cemat earth exam make weapons 

00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:09.789
 the new ones our options were limited q a year ago 

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:13.709
 every ten years or so started holding a port goal and 

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:15.669
 as much as I do that 

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:19.010
 when you're really indecent depression I think it's a little bit 

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:21.359
 the difference 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.359
 we arrive at the third third that was won 12.00 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.939
 other uses 

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:28.120
 it's just 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.990
 Yes I think 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.369
 what did I see - Thursday 8 am we call to be more relaxed 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.030
 for us to come into the isere let know that she was a little bit of 

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:42.279
 of not really thought too much 

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:44.669
 checkout that can happen or not 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:48.300
 the monthly the stake is to ride tournai 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.330
 it's a hockey game 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.539
 must really fail it's the one I know I think a little more 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:58.909
 relax will try to make games it's a dough 

00:04:58.909 --> 00:05:02.580
 but beware of compelling the hamas to focus on the ice 3 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.009
 so the value more relaxing 3 cm and created chances that we put the 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:10.009
 pressure 

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:12.100
 for his return it is possible 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.620
 Of our society 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.599
 yes this sunday and on his resume 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:18.680
 the station of honor 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.870
 we're going to take that one game at a time a time at a time the leaders 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.180
 of state both 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.080
 there as I am 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.089
 for a little bit 

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:29.879
 e go there with the key an agreement 

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:33.319
 and really play relax with intensity 

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:37.500
 and to have the pleasure of playing a hundred and fifty years as a player 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:39.400
 really 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:44.750
 to the enthusiasm of and play gold but this mention on ice and pear 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.970
 what is it going wrong surely even changes measures last year what 

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:50.819
 I believe it is 2 0 

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:56.300
 the senior management qmb a match is obviously same theme that changes 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.629
 very quickly 

00:05:57.629 --> 00:05:59.849
 if you judge the level 

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:02.589
 i hate you lived m 

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:04.819
 advisor 

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:08.189
 that I am lucky enough 

00:06:08.189 --> 00:06:09.000
 I did not know 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.280
 we made a match tonight and in europe the weight that people have joined the most 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.680
 high level 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.740
 I was doing a real 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.880
 I come back from a single preparation that we practiced the next match and 

00:06:23.389 --> 00:06:25.919
 laroche three years realizes the tempo 

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:28.680
 the tempo is the highest now go 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.419
 I believe that everyone 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:33.379
 will look at himself in a tea mirror 

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:36.650
 funny is that I think everyone knows that their job 

00:06:37.779 --> 00:06:39.069
 for anthony level 

00:06:39.069 --> 00:06:41.089
 most productive clan 

00:06:41.089 --> 00:06:42.610
 and I believe that everything is possible
