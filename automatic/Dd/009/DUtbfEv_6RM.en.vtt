00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:11.429
 all my love for ps4 i can't 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.620
 overlook the fact that games for which 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.599
 the console itself was created worth 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.480
 insanely expensive with all its meager 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.250
 although the bk range represents 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.990
 good alternative but confess 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.970
 much more comfortable to sit on the sofa and 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.310
 slowly play nova come out and 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.930
 leave the dispute and the master flights to another 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.939
 Well, today I would like to tell you 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.130
 you about the game that with all its 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.149
 low price pleasure not 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.760
 less triple 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.870
 hey projects talk about tales 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.870
 from worries lance 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.410
 the plot of the game begins after the action 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.670
 the second part of the series barton finck in which 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:16.100
 the main antagonist of the series dies 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:17.840
 handsome jack for corporations and perrin 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.060
 in which by the way you work it 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.780
 means a raise but it is clear that the plot is not 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.270
 was hanging 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.900
 if the hero, that is, you would not be given 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.670
 illusory lyuley 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.430
 thereby lowering you and sending you to 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.080
 pandora with a fucking cloud of money and cool 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.570
 wheelbarrow to buy the key to the store 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.550
 which will provide the most advanced 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.130
 technology corporation on which you 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.900
 killed all my life at the same time and arm of course 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.850
 the laws of the genre all covered with copper 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.040
 pelvis after you ask where 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.410
 there is a souvenir shop at the left 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.360
 shawma selling guy and you 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.920
 Tarava bandits attack then falls 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.040
 cool robot when firing at all she 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.590
 then they beat it theft but all this 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.210
 consequently the reality is that you have the 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.890
 no one in a mask who 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.720
 Concurrently you tell your 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.030
 story just because he is bored 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.649
 haul the protagonist carcass through the desert 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.750
 along the way, it turns out real 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.970
 circumstances of the purchase transaction so 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.530
 expensive key in the form of your partner for 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.050
 which by the way you will also have to 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.030
 play that way begins 1 of 5 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.650
 episodes that narrate about strings 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.360
 the adventures of our heroes 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.370
 graphics on all supported 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.020
 devices their word can not be much 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.390
 call magnificent but in the same and 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.580
 chip is still the same borderlands not 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.380
 shooter and kitty series you only need 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.960
 press buttons when this is from you 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.370
 asked more often you will look beautiful 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.560
 and interesting prices they participate 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.360
 skirmishes and killing yes on 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.310
 computers it looks not so hot but 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.020
 because there are mobile consoles 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:44.510
 devices on which the ported game 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.220
 all telltale games always porting 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.840
 your games on all popular devices 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.880
 while trying to keep the price 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.010
 policy is the same another question what 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.140
 for example on the console you can buy 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.569
 separate episode for 200 rubles a season 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.890
 pass to all episodes for 800 with a single 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.170
 the price of the game incentive 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.540
 this whole conversation I lead to the same thoughts 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.090
 similar projects are far from even 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.620
 for poppies the game looks quite 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.150
 acceptable but not for the staff 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.620
 much nicer to sit in front of the TV 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.769
 and watch the progress of the plot 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.819
 chewing fluff then this is what is 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.860
 philosophy city ​​telltale games but 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.810
 back on pandora all your actions 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.450
 reflected on the subsequent development 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.459
 plot your companions will remember your 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.739
 promises will remind you of your weaknesses and 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.599
 so on shorter everything is tied to them and 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.760
 on the dialogues I would also like to note 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:32.040
 sparkling humor in the style of the original 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.349
 the series that are impregnated with all the action well 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.629
 Of the serious disadvantages perhaps localization 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:38.459
 there is no hint in psn 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:40.769
 Russian for me is certainly not 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.750
 problem but i'm not alone on the planet so 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.970
 that before you take the game think 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.620
 English voice acting in all versions 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.930
 Well, for staff provided 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.780
 Subtitles in general I can recommend 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.730
 this game especially if you're tired 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.920
 all sorts of jokers and the game is available almost 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:59.370
 on all devices, be it a tablet 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.349
 phone or console I don't know 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:04.590
 you are confused by the lack of Russian 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:06.390
 localization then decide for yourself whether 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.599
 it is for you or not and it is better to teach 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.599
 English 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.680
 tried to
