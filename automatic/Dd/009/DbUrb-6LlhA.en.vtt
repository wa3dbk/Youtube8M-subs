is super smooth and velvety and the

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.790 
is super smooth and velvety and the
color<00:04:32.790> is<00:04:32.880> matte<00:04:33.420> and<00:04:33.660> that's<00:04:34.080> what<00:04:34.260> they<00:04:34.440> said

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
color is matte and that's what they said

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.560 
color is matte and that's what they said
but<00:04:35.340> the<00:04:35.460> one<00:04:35.610> thing<00:04:35.790> I<00:04:35.880> noticed<00:04:36.300> is<00:04:36.540> that

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
but the one thing I noticed is that

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.540 
but the one thing I noticed is that
these<00:04:37.050> things<00:04:37.290> don't<00:04:37.560> twist<00:04:38.010> up<00:04:38.190> or<00:04:38.340> anything

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
these things don't twist up or anything

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.140 
these things don't twist up or anything

do this shirt instead and that was like
a<00:06:21.440> really<00:06:21.680> long<00:06:21.860> explanation<00:06:22.580> so<00:06:23.300> it's<00:06:23.510> now

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:23.840 
a really long explanation so it's now

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:29.320 
a really long explanation so it's now
about<00:06:24.110> to<00:06:26.320> imagining<00:06:27.320> and<00:06:27.790> the<00:06:28.790> kids<00:06:29.030> see<00:06:29.300> that

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:29.330 
about to imagining and the kids see that

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.500 
about to imagining and the kids see that
um<00:06:30.230> the<00:06:30.770> lipstick<00:06:31.190> cowboy<00:06:31.610> off<00:06:31.820> a<00:06:31.850> little<00:06:32.240> bit

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:32.510 
um the lipstick cowboy off a little bit

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:36.040 
um the lipstick cowboy off a little bit
especially<00:06:32.990> on<00:06:33.380> the<00:06:33.470> inside<00:06:33.890> minutes<00:06:34.960> so<00:06:35.960> you

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.050 
especially on the inside minutes so you

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:38.980 
especially on the inside minutes so you
probably<00:06:36.260> would<00:06:36.800> have<00:06:36.830> to<00:06:36.980> reapply<00:06:37.510> and<00:06:38.510> maybe

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:38.990 
probably would have to reapply and maybe

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:43.090 
probably would have to reapply and maybe
like<00:06:39.460> the<00:06:40.460> hour<00:06:40.580> of<00:06:40.880> using<00:06:41.330> it<00:06:41.800> the<00:06:42.800> stain

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:43.100 
like the hour of using it the stain

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.400 
like the hour of using it the stain
