00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
entertaining I think two might be a

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.030 
entertaining I think two might be a
little<00:02:45.330> too<00:02:45.480> much<00:02:45.510> because<00:02:46.290> it's<00:02:46.560> pretty<00:02:46.740> rich

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
little too much because it's pretty rich

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.590 
little too much because it's pretty rich
but<00:02:47.340> you<00:02:47.430> put<00:02:47.640> little<00:02:47.880> tomato<00:02:48.150> sauce<00:02:48.360> in<00:02:48.510> the

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
but you put little tomato sauce in the

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.870 
but you put little tomato sauce in the
bottom<00:02:48.870> so<00:02:49.020> that<00:02:49.050> it<00:02:49.200> doesn't<00:02:49.590> stick<00:02:49.710> and<00:02:50.100> then

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
bottom so that it doesn't stick and then

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.910 
bottom so that it doesn't stick and then
just<00:02:51.180> put<00:02:51.720> them<00:02:51.870> on<00:02:51.990> top<00:02:52.290> and<00:02:52.590> you<00:02:52.680> can<00:02:52.710> make
