00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
okay so let's first see the design and

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.650 
okay so let's first see the design and
build<00:03:43.970> of<00:03:44.239> the<00:03:44.450> memo<00:03:44.900> so<00:03:45.230> comparing<00:03:45.920> it<00:03:45.980> to<00:03:46.010> the

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:46.660 
build of the memo so comparing it to the

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.560 
build of the memo so comparing it to the
500e<00:03:47.660> that<00:03:47.870> i<00:03:47.900> recently<00:03:48.410> reviewed<00:03:49.160> is

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
500e that i recently reviewed is

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.090 
500e that i recently reviewed is
actually<00:03:50.570> it's<00:03:50.780> more<00:03:51.110> thinner<00:03:51.500> and<00:03:51.890> lighter

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
actually it's more thinner and lighter

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.650 
actually it's more thinner and lighter
and<00:03:52.550> usually<00:03:53.510> a<00:03:53.540> couple<00:03:54.280> 5.3<00:03:55.280> or<00:03:55.519> a<00:03:56.000> larger

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
and usually a couple 5.3 or a larger

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.740 
and usually a couple 5.3 or a larger
phone<00:03:57.350> or<00:03:57.560> phablet<00:03:57.800> nap<00:03:58.640> atmos-<00:03:59.090> gotcha<00:03:59.510> but

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
phone or phablet nap atmos- gotcha but

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.630 
phone or phablet nap atmos- gotcha but
here<00:04:00.140> actually<00:04:00.709> it<00:04:00.830> is<00:04:00.980> more<00:04:01.370> lighter

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
here actually it is more lighter

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.600 
here actually it is more lighter
comparing<00:04:02.510> it<00:04:02.570> to<00:04:02.600> the<00:04:02.780> 500<00:04:03.560> d<00:04:03.769> okay<00:04:04.370> so

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
comparing it to the 500 d okay so

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:06.699 
comparing it to the 500 d okay so
