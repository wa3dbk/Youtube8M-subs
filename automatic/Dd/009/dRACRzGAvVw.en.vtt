not wearing you know clip-on pedals

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.790 
not wearing you know clip-on pedals
because<00:03:17.760> I<00:03:17.970> don't<00:03:18.150> like<00:03:18.330> I<00:03:18.840> don't<00:03:19.110> like<00:03:19.380> tippy

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.130 
because I don't like I don't like tippy
pebbles<00:03:20.130> because<00:03:20.400> they're<00:03:20.580> expensive<00:03:21.390> and<00:03:21.840> I

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
pebbles because they're expensive and I

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.580 
pebbles because they're expensive and I
don't<00:03:22.350> think<00:03:22.470> I'm<00:03:22.560> necessary<00:03:24.440> you<00:03:25.440> know

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
don't think I'm necessary you know

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.430 
don't think I'm necessary you know
probably<00:03:26.190> when<00:03:26.580> I'm<00:03:26.760> cycling<00:03:27.360> downhill<00:03:27.570> and<00:03:28.320> I

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
probably when I'm cycling downhill and I

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.130 
probably when I'm cycling downhill and I
fall<00:03:28.740> off<00:03:28.920> I<00:03:29.220> do<00:03:29.670> not<00:03:30.120> have<00:03:30.209> the<00:03:30.360> brainpower<00:03:30.660> to

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
fall off I do not have the brainpower to

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.250 
fall off I do not have the brainpower to
think<00:03:31.410> turn<00:03:32.010> my<00:03:32.250> foot<00:03:32.580> left<00:03:33.150> a<00:03:33.390> bit<00:03:33.570> to<00:03:34.140> make

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
think turn my foot left a bit to make

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.710 
think turn my foot left a bit to make
them<00:03:34.410> unfit<00:03:34.770> so<00:03:35.490> if<00:03:35.640> you<00:03:35.820> have<00:03:36.090> flat<00:03:36.209> downhill

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
them unfit so if you have flat downhill

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.380 
them unfit so if you have flat downhill
pedals<00:03:37.110> and<00:03:37.410> you<00:03:38.400> want<00:03:38.580> shoes<00:03:38.850> or<00:03:39.060> sitting

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
pedals and you want shoes or sitting

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.510 
pedals and you want shoes or sitting
from<00:03:39.510> very<00:03:39.690> nicely<00:03:39.900> on<00:03:40.230> them<00:03:40.380> you<00:03:40.920> need<00:03:41.100> to<00:03:41.160> get

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
from very nicely on them you need to get

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:44.990 
from very nicely on them you need to get
skate<00:03:42.150> shoes<00:03:42.739> like<00:03:43.739> these<00:03:44.010> now<00:03:44.610> have<00:03:44.730> a<00:03:44.790> very

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
skate shoes like these now have a very

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.020 
skate shoes like these now have a very
flat<00:03:45.330> sole<00:03:45.660> they're<00:03:46.350> built<00:03:46.770> for<00:03:47.489> actually

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
flat sole they're built for actually

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.500 
flat sole they're built for actually
bitumen<00:03:49.250> that<00:03:50.250> I<00:03:50.280> built<00:03:50.550> for<00:03:50.850> gripping<00:03:51.209> to

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
bitumen that I built for gripping to

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.720 
bitumen that I built for gripping to
skate<00:03:51.840> boards<00:03:52.140> of<00:03:52.320> skateboards<00:03:53.250> which<00:03:53.280> are

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
skate boards of skateboards which are

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.500 
skate boards of skateboards which are
flat<00:03:54.090> mostly<00:03:55.370> and<00:03:56.370> that's<00:03:56.550> why<00:03:56.820> as<00:03:57.150> you<00:03:57.360> can

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
flat mostly and that's why as you can

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.180 
flat mostly and that's why as you can
see<00:03:57.720> they<00:03:58.020> have<00:03:58.140> a<00:03:58.230> flat<00:03:58.500> sole<00:03:58.860> which<00:03:59.040> are

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
see they have a flat sole which are

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.380 
see they have a flat sole which are
great<00:03:59.459> I<00:03:59.900> mean<00:04:01.220> these<00:04:02.220> aren't<00:04:02.640> so<00:04:03.030> great<00:04:03.180> even

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
great I mean these aren't so great even

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.000 
great I mean these aren't so great even
though<00:04:03.600> they're<00:04:03.750> flat<00:04:04.340> because<00:04:06.920> you<00:04:07.920> know

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
though they're flat because you know

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.640 
though they're flat because you know
they're<00:04:08.190> very<00:04:08.220> narrow<00:04:08.730> and<00:04:09.209> where<00:04:09.750> I<00:04:09.780> where<00:04:10.620> I

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
they're very narrow and where I where I

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.350 
they're very narrow and where I where I
put<00:04:11.010> my<00:04:11.160> feet<00:04:11.370> on<00:04:11.520> the<00:04:11.670> pedals<00:04:12.000> which<00:04:12.180> are

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
put my feet on the pedals which are

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.500 
put my feet on the pedals which are
about<00:04:12.540> there<00:04:13.070> is<00:04:14.070> quite<00:04:14.370> thin<00:04:14.700> here<00:04:15.030> so<00:04:15.300> not

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
about there is quite thin here so not

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.110 
about there is quite thin here so not
all<00:04:15.630> the<00:04:15.780> studs<00:04:16.140> would<00:04:16.350> grip<00:04:16.760> so<00:04:17.760> that's<00:04:17.940> why<00:04:18.090> I

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
all the studs would grip so that's why I

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.570 
all the studs would grip so that's why I
got<00:04:18.330> those<00:04:18.480> let<00:04:18.989> me<00:04:19.080> show<00:04:19.260> you<00:04:19.320> a<00:04:19.590> bad<00:04:20.280> example

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:20.580 
got those let me show you a bad example

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.480
