let's<00:04:11.799> take<00:04:11.980> a<00:04:12.010> look<00:04:12.250> at<00:04:12.340> some<00:04:12.549> of<00:04:12.610> the

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
let's take a look at some of the

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.240 
let's take a look at some of the
different<00:04:13.030> flavors<00:04:13.660> if<00:04:14.140> you<00:04:14.290> will<00:04:14.500> that<00:04:15.040> they

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
different flavors if you will that they

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.460 
different flavors if you will that they
have<00:04:15.459> on<00:04:15.760> the<00:04:15.940> OCO<00:04:16.269> fruit<00:04:16.630> they<00:04:16.959> have<00:04:17.169> the
