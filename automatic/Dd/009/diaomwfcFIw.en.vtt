00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
and then to put our fabric that's been

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.279 
and then to put our fabric that's been
interfaced<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.210> stiffened<00:00:51.750> on<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.020> top<00:00:52.260> of

that then we take this tool and press it
down<00:00:54.930> like<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:55.860> we're<00:00:56.100> going<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.370> hammer

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
down like that and we're going to hammer

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.820 
down like that and we're going to hammer
it<00:00:57.510> really<00:00:58.170> hard<00:00:59.930> and<00:01:01.969> it's<00:01:02.969> noisy<00:01:03.149> and<00:01:04.049> now

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
it really hard and it's noisy and now

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.179 
it really hard and it's noisy and now
you<00:01:04.890> can<00:01:05.430> see<00:01:05.850> we've<00:01:06.720> made<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:06.990> hole<00:01:07.350> in<00:01:07.619> the

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
you can see we've made a hole in the

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.770 
you can see we've made a hole in the
fabric<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.670> it's<00:01:08.760> fallen<00:01:09.150> through<00:01:09.420> like<00:01:09.750> the

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
fabric and it's fallen through like the

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.100 
fabric and it's fallen through like the
middle<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.979> polo<00:01:11.220> mint<00:01:11.670> okay<00:01:12.510> it's<00:01:12.659> fallen

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
middle of a polo mint okay it's fallen

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.520 
middle of a polo mint okay it's fallen
through<00:01:13.549> this<00:01:14.549> tool<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.330> then<00:01:16.140> what<00:01:16.290> we<00:01:16.380> do<00:01:16.500> is

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
through this tool and then what we do is

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.730 
through this tool and then what we do is
we<00:01:16.740> turn<00:01:16.979> this<00:01:17.130> tool<00:01:17.400> over<00:01:17.970> so<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:19.140> makes<00:01:19.470> a

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
we turn this tool over so it it makes a

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.130 
we turn this tool over so it it makes a
little<00:01:19.890> there's<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.820> little<00:01:21.090> dip<00:01:21.360> in<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.840> tool

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
little there's a little dip in that tool

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.420 
little there's a little dip in that tool
there<00:01:22.439> which<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.189> perfect<00:01:23.880> for<00:01:25.100> the<00:01:26.100> curved

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
there which is perfect for the curved

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.660 
there which is perfect for the curved
edge<00:01:26.790> of<00:01:27.090> this<00:01:27.540> part<00:01:28.080> of<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.439> eyelet<00:01:28.890> which<00:01:29.520> I

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
edge of this part of the eyelet which I

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.730 
edge of this part of the eyelet which I
call<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:29.909> hat<00:01:30.240> and<00:01:30.600> that<00:01:30.869> sits<00:01:31.170> in<00:01:31.380> there<00:01:31.530> like

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
call the hat and that sits in there like

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.580 
call the hat and that sits in there like
that<00:01:31.920> and<00:01:32.869> if<00:01:33.869> this<00:01:34.020> is<00:01:34.079> going<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.380> be<00:01:34.470> the

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
that and if this is going to be the

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.740 
that and if this is going to be the
front<00:01:34.770> of<00:01:35.070> our<00:01:35.250> rock<00:01:35.490> sack<00:01:35.820> then<00:01:36.390> we've<00:01:36.540> got<00:01:36.570> to

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
front of our rock sack then we've got to

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.920 
front of our rock sack then we've got to
turn<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.350> over<00:01:37.939> so<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.479> top<00:01:39.659> of<00:01:39.840> the

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
turn that over so that the top of the

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.690 
turn that over so that the top of the
Hat<00:01:40.079> comes<00:01:40.439> through<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.040> back<00:01:41.189> so<00:01:41.520> if<00:01:41.610> you

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
Hat comes through to the back so if you

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.889 
Hat comes through to the back so if you
just<00:01:41.909> think<00:01:42.259> hat<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.649> back<00:01:43.860> Oh<00:01:44.479> Samson<00:01:45.479> we're

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
just think hat and back Oh Samson we're

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.050 
just think hat and back Oh Samson we're
not<00:01:46.020> quite<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.320> same<00:01:46.470> button<00:01:46.860> put<00:01:47.670> that<00:01:47.850> on

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
not quite the same button put that on

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.539 
not quite the same button put that on
there<00:01:48.240> like<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.479> so<00:01:49.439> that<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.829> hat<00:01:50.040> pops

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
there like that so that the hat pops

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.090 
there like that so that the hat pops
through<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.030> hole<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.540> then<00:01:51.840> take<00:01:52.259> this

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
through the hole and then take this

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.910 
through the hole and then take this
washer<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:54.780> if<00:01:54.899> we<00:01:55.020> look<00:01:55.140> at<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.380> picture

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
washer and if we look at the picture

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.840 
washer and if we look at the picture
this<00:01:56.579> washer<00:01:57.119> goes<00:01:57.649> that<00:01:58.649> way<00:01:58.950> down<00:01:59.340> its<00:01:59.640> kind

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
this washer goes that way down its kind

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.790 
this washer goes that way down its kind
of<00:01:59.909> got<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.149> little<00:02:00.299> groove<00:02:00.869> through<00:02:01.259> it

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
of got a little groove through it

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.080 
of got a little groove through it
doesn't<00:02:02.040> really<00:02:02.130> matter<00:02:02.430> which<00:02:02.670> way<00:02:02.880> around

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
doesn't really matter which way around

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.140 
doesn't really matter which way around
you<00:02:03.270> get<00:02:03.420> that<00:02:03.570> but<00:02:03.870> that<00:02:04.110> flops<00:02:04.860> on<00:02:05.160> the<00:02:05.880> back

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
you get that but that flops on the back

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.500 
you get that but that flops on the back
like<00:02:06.750> that<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.590> then<00:02:08.160> you<00:02:08.310> use<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.760> same<00:02:09.119> tool

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:09.510 
like that and then you use the same tool

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:11.900 
like that and then you use the same tool
