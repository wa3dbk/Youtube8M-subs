00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.000
 twelve thousand nine hundred years ago something 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.370
 it happened on the earth that changed the 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.430
 history of large mammals and 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.930
 being human forever is something that 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:22.540
 we put in this moment in quotes 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:25.180
 changed the climate changed the climate and made 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:27.849
 come a very cold period and very 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.520
 dry and what happened during 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:33.640
 this period that scientists call 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:36.130
 younger trias because something happened that had 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.809
 a tremendous impact for life in the 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.910
 planet for humans in 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:41.920
 concrete because they went extinct 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.110
 all large mammals from the 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.420
 saber teeth to the mastodons a 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.060
 all those animals that our 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.790
 distant ancestors hunted and chased 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.680
 in their migrations they chased and hunted 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:57.330
 with spears and 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:00.280
 a fact that forced them to be nomads 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.350
 nomadic tribes or small groups of 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.839
 nomadic human nomads as for example 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.850
 in the USA where today in the USA the clovis 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.880
 the town of the Clovis and that suddenly 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:12.280
 they saw that their sustenance disappeared with 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.080
 which they had to 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.990
 manage to keep surviving 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:20.600
 what happened that were made 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.420
 settled down and started to live on 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.100
 other things could be twelve thousand ago 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.650
 nine hundred years 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.330
 that agriculture arose or the way 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.250
 of sedentary life based on 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.170
 agricultural production happens that in the 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.470
 same period in other regions very 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.420
 distant from what is North America 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:42.030
 we also find a similar thing 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.220
 that cooling as I say was global and 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.920
 change the customs of our 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.890
 ancestors but that change 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.270
 it produced does not argue anyone the reasons 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.789
 of that change is what is in 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.360
 discussion until now it was thought that the 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:02:01.619
 america cold at that time a great 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.990
 ice barrier broke and released a 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.149
 huge amount of ice water that went to 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.009
 stop at the Atlantic this huge 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.390
 contribution of icy water would affect 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.340
 the currents on all 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.080
 warm currents and caused this 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.239
 global cooling that those 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.489
 currents across the ocean work 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.019
 like the veins of a large organism that 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.840
 is the earth and contribute to its 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:23.299
 cooling or your heating now 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.380
 however a group of scientists 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:28.290
 they think that 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:31.590
 it was about the impact of a meteorite that 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:35.430
 there was a body come from space that in 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:37.470
 the Quebec region fell and provoked it was 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.270
 he the one who unleashed all this huge 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.970
 climate change whose consequences 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.640
 we still have now because I remember you 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:48.060
 that without agriculture there would not have been 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.950
 settlements there would have been no cities 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.990
 there would have been no countries and probably 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.210
 there would have been no civilization, there is no more 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.400
 have to look at the towns that are still 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.170
 nomads and they continue to live in conditions 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.790
 that would be prehistoric in the middle of 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.790
 jungles chasing their prey 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.640
 and what evidence there is of physical evidence there 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:11.340
 that this was really like that until 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.349
 now not many the truth most of 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:17.370
 of the tests are some small cells 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:19.440
 of molten rock and melted is supposed 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.850
 during the impact when a 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.220
 meteorite generated in temperatures 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.860
 terrible and when it hits the 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:29.040
 ground all that molten material that 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.380
 it goes bounced as it charges this form very 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.330
 characteristic of small small 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.920
 great little drops of lava that 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.360
 they remain solidify so they stay like this 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.940
 well they have found they have 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.220
 found many of these is cells from 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.950
 solidified rocks that was melted in 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.870
 some time in the region and also in 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.209
 other areas where the 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.500
 impact crater but that's where it is 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.060
 the problem that impact crater 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.950
 has not yet appeared 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.170
 it is true that near the regions 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.720
 near the Quebec region there is a large 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.030
 impact crater about 4 kilometers 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.790
 in diameter, it must be a great 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.190
 collision but the data does not match 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.590
 those of these cells the crater must 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.610
 be other than not unless this 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.130
 Crater or other 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.570
 and in the area they have covered the crater 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.520
 original but it's something that 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.560
 scientists are investigating everything 

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:19.560
 If we know perfectly 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.140
 that at that moment in the history of 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:24.240
 humanity and the planet makes 12 000 900 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.130
 millions of years the weather cooled 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.710
 suddenly and that it had some 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.600
 huge consequences for both the 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.940
 fauna as for humans that had 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.880
 then as much as I said does a 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:37.980
 moment that could be the origin of a 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:40.080
 change of habits in humans 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.380
 that took us to what we are today 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.380
 in day
