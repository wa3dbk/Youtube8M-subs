00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:03.760
 hello girls I hope you are very 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.460
 good in this video I'm going to 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:09.459
 show how to clean the brushes for 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:11.289
 the hair that created these brushes 

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:13.660
 they tend to work like sponges 

00:00:11.289 --> 00:00:16.019
 because they retain everything that is dust 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:19.449
 oils hair products 

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:21.759
 dirty bacteria and smells and I'm sure 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:23.890
 that none of us would like 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:25.599
 that our brush smells ugly 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.090
 so good in this video we're going to 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:31.400
 give a little love to the brushes 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.620
 that at the end of the day this is what we 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.600
 leave beautiful with or dry the hair 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.489
 and good is super easy 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.220
 we started by removing all the hair 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:43.760
 that the brush has but does not use a 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.379
 stick like this or a finite comb like 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.250
 this one for good to remove all 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:51.830
 hair and then in a deep container 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.989
 we put teeth in mouth I prefer water 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:57.739
 hot because that way I know I'm going 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:59.449
 to kill all the bacteria and shampoo the 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.220
 while I 'm using the shampoo 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:04.190
 that we use every day and this is the 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:07.100
 campus organ and borders but you 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:09.290
 in the shampoo of your preference and good 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.600
 now we start to wash the brush 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.369
 obviously if your round brush you're going 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.680
 spinning around to be cleaned by 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.320
 everywhere if your brush has wood 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.690
 try not to wet that area because it 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.300
 It hurts and good after they have done 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.970
 this leave on the brush as per 5 or 10 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:28.039
 minutes to absorb the water with 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.530
 shampoo and clean it better and good since 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:34.590
 then with refreshing cold water 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.510
 we remove the water with shampoo that 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.610
 you had and well now we go with this guy 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.650
 of brush that is a flat brush and 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.350
 We do the same procedure to remove 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.409
 the hair you have can use a 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.140
 stick with a finite comb like you 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.149
 they feel more comfortable and good the same 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.580
 procedure in a deep container we put 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.770
 hot water and shampoo I put 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:58.680
 about 5 cans of shampoo 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:02.040
 but this you are seeing and you 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:05.100
 you are going testing and well we wash 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.770
 the brush if I recommend you leave 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.289
 the brush like for 510 minutes in the 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.380
 soap because that way is going to remove 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:16.290
 all the fats the brush has and 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.200
 well, it will be like new and 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.480
 then with cold water we remove this all 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.459
 the excess of shampoo you have and there you 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.940
 all fats will go and all the 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.940
 dirty 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.709
 and good to take the cleaning to another 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.890
 level we will be using puppets 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.239
 essential that is an oil to eliminate 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.709
 all bacteria 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.739
 and good since I'm putting some 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.720
 droplets in a container and a SEPI 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:47.090
 old tooth obviously we are going to clean 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.970
 very well what is the bottom of the brush 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.920
 the sow this and well that's also going to 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.400
 Help him give a good smell to the 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.860
 brush and eliminate all the germs and 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.780
 then well do not forget to give it very 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.640
 well to all the sows and has a 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.580
 round brush are spinning and 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.959
 also do not forget to avoid the part 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.269
 of wood because we do not want to be 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:12.230
 damage the brush and good after 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:14.360
 that with cold water we rinse again the 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.360
 pe the brush because that way 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.190
 we eliminate the excess oil and good 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.260
