00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
I'd let that motion sensor blip go an

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.859 
I'd let that motion sensor blip go an
extra<00:01:10.950> time<00:01:11.460> just<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:12.060> make<00:01:12.210> sure<00:01:12.240> he<00:01:12.720> was

anyways<00:04:58.010> that<00:04:58.550> was<00:04:58.880> the<00:04:59.540> game<00:04:59.720> search<00:05:00.050> on<00:05:00.320> grid

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
anyways that was the game search on grid

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.230 
anyways that was the game search on grid
I<00:05:00.860> think<00:05:01.220> it<00:05:01.280> was<00:05:01.370> like<00:05:01.490> nine<00:05:01.790> and<00:05:02.000> two<00:05:02.090> or

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
I think it was like nine and two or

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.090 
I think it was like nine and two or
something<00:05:02.420> like<00:05:02.480> that<00:05:02.540> so<00:05:03.530> pretty<00:05:03.740> decent

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100 
something like that so pretty decent

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.430 
something like that so pretty decent
first<00:05:04.580> round<00:05:04.880> the<00:05:05.540> last<00:05:05.720> round<00:05:06.050> was<00:05:06.170> pretty

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
first round the last round was pretty

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.650 
first round the last round was pretty
good<00:05:06.560> as<00:05:06.710> well<00:05:06.740> there<00:05:07.730> was<00:05:07.970> you<00:05:08.240> know<00:05:08.270> I<00:05:08.360> wanted

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
good as well there was you know I wanted

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.450 
good as well there was you know I wanted
to<00:05:08.720> show<00:05:08.870> you<00:05:08.900> that<00:05:09.020> that<00:05:09.650> interference<00:05:10.160> run

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
to show you that that interference run

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.180 
to show you that that interference run
on<00:05:11.110> that<00:05:12.110> third<00:05:12.410> round<00:05:12.680> so<00:05:12.890> I<00:05:12.950> thought<00:05:13.100> that

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
on that third round so I thought that
