this<00:00:34.150> is<00:00:34.360> the<00:00:34.510> original<00:00:35.220> that's<00:00:36.220> the<00:00:36.460> retro<00:00:36.910> I

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
this is the original that's the retro I

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.979 
this is the original that's the retro I
don't<00:00:38.500> even<00:00:38.620> have<00:00:38.890> to<00:00:39.010> tell<00:00:39.250> you<00:00:39.570> how<00:00:40.570> smooth

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989 
don't even have to tell you how smooth

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.510 
don't even have to tell you how smooth
the<00:00:41.170> leather<00:00:41.410> is<00:00:41.650> on<00:00:41.920> the<00:00:42.040> original<00:00:42.610> I<00:00:44.309> mean<00:00:45.309> we

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
the leather is on the original I mean we

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.420 
the leather is on the original I mean we
all<00:00:45.670> know<00:00:45.910> that<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:47.410> new<00:00:47.590> releases<00:00:47.890> get<00:00:48.309> the

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
all know that the new releases get the

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.240 
all know that the new releases get the
synthetic<00:00:49.030> material<00:00:49.680> but<00:00:50.680> this<00:00:50.890> is<00:00:51.070> pretty

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
synthetic material but this is pretty

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.479 
synthetic material but this is pretty
decent<00:00:51.489> in<00:00:51.940> my<00:00:52.150> opinion<00:00:52.830> it's<00:00:53.830> pretty<00:00:54.160> stiff

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
decent in my opinion it's pretty stiff

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.470 
decent in my opinion it's pretty stiff
compared<00:00:55.030> to<00:00:55.239> this<00:00:55.390> so<00:00:55.960> the<00:00:56.080> original<00:00:56.620> but<00:00:57.480> you

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:58.480 
compared to this so the original but you

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.890 
compared to this so the original but you
got<00:00:58.660> to<00:00:59.970> take<00:01:00.970> it<00:01:01.000> how<00:01:01.239> they<00:01:01.390> putting<00:01:01.660> it<00:01:01.750> out

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:01.900 
got to take it how they putting it out

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:10.950 
got to take it how they putting it out
or<00:01:02.050> just<00:01:02.080> pass<00:01:02.470> it<00:01:02.680> up<00:01:09.270> if<00:01:10.270> your<00:01:10.450> side<00:01:10.780> of<00:01:10.899> the

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
or just pass it up if your side of the

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.889 
or just pass it up if your side of the
front<00:01:13.500> this<00:01:14.500> is<00:01:14.560> the<00:01:14.860> original<00:01:15.540> this<00:01:16.540> is<00:01:16.780> the
