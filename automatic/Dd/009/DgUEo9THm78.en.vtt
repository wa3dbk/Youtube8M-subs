 I would like to check

 This eco-sport is based on Ford's Pfister segment's compact cars 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:41.260
 It is a crossover model 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:46.420
 Minimum ground clearance is 180mm There are also such as trying It's back Spear corresponding 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:52.710
 It has a cross-country feel but this model is ff 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:52.710

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:11.770
 But we checked the off-road performance of the Ford eco sport Igaiyaigai 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:16.780
 It was left to the impression that quite enjoy the off-road run 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:21.130
 Honestly before 4 runs though the approach angle of the front is 25 degrees though 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:25.630
 The lip spoiler part is jumping out and the off road will hit 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:30.580
 Also a without, but I'm such anxiety bought 2 to hit When I started running 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:31.990
 As per the fact that river jungle is excellent 35 minutes it is possible to care 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:37.640
 I was able to put out 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:43.790
 In Mogul suspension rainy day is not a successful off-loader but he is still 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:48.500
 Hard road surface in an attempt to stretch the legs and take advantage of the capture also traction control tires 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:51.780
 And sometimes when you go off while using idle and turn off 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.090
 Yuzu f model but unexpectedly runs out 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:58.880
 me 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:05:00.440
 Suspension low floor that is deep pockets will climb to more than to is the tire road surface even at home where there is here a little 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.340
 Keep an eye on 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:07.760
 There is such an impression and there is a woman and it is fun 0 anyway 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:11.720
 Such a feeling of grip also remained very rich 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.500
 Recently, the number of pictorial crossover models based on the b platform has increased. 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.080
 But 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:19.580

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:19.580

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.120
 Hmm
