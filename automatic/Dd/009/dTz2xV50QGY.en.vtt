00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.950
 today you are going to all have the gamers and 

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:05.690
 well this is the video that complements the 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.690
 what we did before of types of 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.190
 subjects where we saw all kinds of type 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.869
 of subjects that are in league of legends 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.659
 and also the time of appearance and the 

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:15.889
 appearance of each of them 

00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:18.140
 let's clarify some things and go 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:21.110
 to see new things we also learned 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.510
 that at one minute and 30 seconds is generated 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:25.490
 the first wave well today we're going to see 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.410
 the time it takes for these waves to 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.090
 reach the different lines the line 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.220
 from above the middle line and the line 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.629
 below is something that you do not have very 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.420
 account but that is really quite 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:37.550
 important and now we will see why we see 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.180
 that the middle line is slow to arrive 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.900
 about 23 seconds 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.550
 the line takes 23 seconds to have 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.500
 contact our subjects with the 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.870
 subjects of the enemy but instead the 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.820
 line up the girl below give 33 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.670
 seconds that is 100 seconds more than 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.140
 the middle line at this time 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.120
 you can say it's very good but for what 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.120
 this serves us because this helps us to 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.500
 in that time it depends on if we have 33 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.300
 about 10 seconds depends on we are 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.930
 located then we can make different 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:10.780
 things we can go to get gold with 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.910
 subjects of the jungle we can even 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:14.410
 try a quick change of the 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.210
 different lines of penalties that we have 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.920
 located always taking into account if 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.600
 we are in the middle as in this case we are going 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.320
 to have to make a quicker arching 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.060
 since we only have 23 seconds 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.430
 we can go to bleach then we can 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.140
 return to our line without having to 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.820
 have necessarily lost any 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.580
 subject since the screams will reach 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.200
 the same time that we also 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.119
 It depends a little on the character you have 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.230
 at that time if you have more or less 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.610
 mobility 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:43.460
 and good another thing I wanted to clarify 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:46.970
 enough is the subjects is at 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.350
 general are generated in waves of 6-3 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.210
 of one type and three of another as we saw 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.370
 but when the sudden the 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.900
 cannon generates a total of seven 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.030
 six of always going to be subject of the 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.740
 cannon can also say that when 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.660
 we wrote an inhibitor of that line the 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.940
 subject of the cannon is replaced by a 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:05.390
 super minion so they will continue to be 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:07.430
 waves of seven subjects but not that of the 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.619
 cannon will not appear but a 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.390
 super minion so good I hope that you 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.920
 have liked and see you next 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.920
 video a greeting and see you later
