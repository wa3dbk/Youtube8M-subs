00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.089 
your flight receiver that way you get
the<00:02:13.160> best<00:02:13.360> reception<00:02:14.680> like<00:02:15.680> I<00:02:15.800> mentioned

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
the best reception like I mentioned

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.009 
the best reception like I mentioned
earlier<00:02:16.160> the<00:02:16.459> fuselage<00:02:16.819> is<00:02:17.060> blow<00:02:17.630> molded

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
earlier the fuselage is blow molded

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:20.470 
earlier the fuselage is blow molded
plastic<00:02:18.530> so<00:02:19.459> it<00:02:19.550> is<00:02:19.640> very<00:02:19.819> durable<00:02:20.030> and<00:02:20.330> then

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
plastic so it is very durable and then

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.559 
plastic so it is very durable and then
the<00:02:20.690> wings<00:02:21.080> and<00:02:21.440> tail<00:02:21.890> surfaces<00:02:22.069> are<00:02:22.610> of<00:02:23.000> epo

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
the wings and tail surfaces are of epo

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.229 
the wings and tail surfaces are of epo
foam<00:02:23.930> which<00:02:24.650> again<00:02:25.069> is<00:02:25.310> also<00:02:25.730> very<00:02:26.000> durable

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 
foam which again is also very durable

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.500 
foam which again is also very durable
and<00:02:26.630> can<00:02:27.260> be<00:02:27.380> repaired<00:02:27.769> quite<00:02:28.099> easily<00:02:28.459> now<00:02:29.120> for

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
and can be repaired quite easily now for

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:30.850 
and can be repaired quite easily now for
the<00:02:29.599> important<00:02:30.019> parts<00:02:30.319> I<00:02:30.440> did<00:02:30.650> mention

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
the important parts I did mention

already<00:02:31.400> you<00:02:31.640> do<00:02:31.970> need<00:02:32.150> that<00:02:32.180> three<00:02:32.690> cell<00:02:33.130> lipo

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
already you do need that three cell lipo

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.640 
already you do need that three cell lipo

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
and again if you did decide to run flaps

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.339 
and again if you did decide to run flaps
you'll<00:02:51.769> need<00:02:51.920> two<00:02:52.220> more<00:02:52.430> additional<00:02:53.349> nine
