00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
hi I'm Tom Ruiz and I'm a math

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.839 
hi I'm Tom Ruiz and I'm a math
supervisor<00:00:07.319> today<00:00:08.040> we're<00:00:08.280> going<00:00:08.370> to<00:00:08.460> discuss

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
supervisor today we're going to discuss

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.790 
supervisor today we're going to discuss
how<00:00:09.030> to<00:00:09.090> factor<00:00:09.360> polynomials<00:00:09.809> that<00:00:10.530> have

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
how to factor polynomials that have

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.530 
how to factor polynomials that have
radicals<00:00:11.309> in<00:00:11.460> them

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
radicals in them

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.110 
radicals in them
here's<00:00:13.259> an<00:00:13.380> example<00:00:13.500> of<00:00:14.040> one<00:00:14.820> of<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.000> more

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
here's an example of one of the more

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.470 
here's an example of one of the more
basic<00:00:16.190> polynomials<00:00:17.190> with<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.000> radical

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
basic polynomials with a radical

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.840 
basic polynomials with a radical
involved<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:19.109> radical<00:00:19.859> is<00:00:19.980> your<00:00:20.189> basic<00:00:20.580> square

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
involved a radical is your basic square

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.700 
involved a radical is your basic square
root<00:00:21.060> symbol<00:00:21.330> so<00:00:21.930> in<00:00:22.080> order<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.350> find<00:00:22.590> the

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
root symbol so in order to find the

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.019 
root symbol so in order to find the
square<00:00:22.980> root<00:00:23.010> of<00:00:23.250> something<00:00:23.490> you<00:00:23.760> need<00:00:23.910> to

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
square root of something you need to

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.599 
square root of something you need to
know<00:00:24.180> what<00:00:24.990> number<00:00:25.320> times<00:00:25.500> itself<00:00:25.949> gives<00:00:26.189> you

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
know what number times itself gives you

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.070 
know what number times itself gives you
what's<00:00:27.269> inside<00:00:27.449> here

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
what's inside here

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.740 
what's inside here
however<00:00:28.830> 32<00:00:29.640> is<00:00:29.820> not<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:30.060> perfect<00:00:30.630> square

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
however 32 is not a perfect square

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.569 
however 32 is not a perfect square
therefore<00:00:31.320> there's<00:00:31.500> not<00:00:31.650> any<00:00:31.920> given<00:00:32.340> number

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
therefore there's not any given number

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.780 
therefore there's not any given number
that<00:00:33.210> you<00:00:33.300> can<00:00:33.450> multiply<00:00:34.309> itself<00:00:35.309> by<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.550> get

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
that you can multiply itself by to get

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.150 
that you can multiply itself by to get
32<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.540> well<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:36.840> said<00:00:37.079> some<00:00:37.350> sort<00:00:37.590> of<00:00:37.680> decimal

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
32 and well I said some sort of decimal

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.560 
32 and well I said some sort of decimal
number<00:00:38.430> which<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:38.850> gonna<00:00:39.030> be<00:00:39.120> very<00:00:39.300> hard<00:00:39.480> to

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
number which is gonna be very hard to

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.350 
number which is gonna be very hard to
figure<00:00:39.780> out<00:00:39.930> so<00:00:40.649> by<00:00:41.160> using<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.610> radical<00:00:42.120> sign

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
figure out so by using the radical sign

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.180 
figure out so by using the radical sign
we're<00:00:42.870> gonna<00:00:42.989> we're<00:00:43.500> gonna<00:00:43.559> split<00:00:43.950> this<00:00:44.129> up

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
we're gonna we're gonna split this up

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.310 
we're gonna we're gonna split this up
into<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.730> number<00:00:45.059> portion<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:46.110> letter

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
into the number portion and the letter

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.010 
into the number portion and the letter
portion<00:00:46.829> so<00:00:47.280> we're<00:00:47.399> gonna<00:00:47.489> split<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.969> 32<00:00:48.450> away

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
portion so we're gonna split the 32 away

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.979 
portion so we're gonna split the 32 away
from<00:00:49.399> the<00:00:50.399> x<00:00:50.579> squared<00:00:50.789> which<00:00:51.300> is<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.510> perfect

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
from the x squared which is a perfect

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.100 
from the x squared which is a perfect
square<00:00:52.110> X<00:00:52.440> times<00:00:52.860> X<00:00:53.129> gives<00:00:53.250> you<00:00:53.489> x<00:00:53.670> squared<00:00:54.079> 32

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
square X times X gives you x squared 32

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.229 
square X times X gives you x squared 32
not<00:00:55.530> as<00:00:55.710> easy<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:56.039> do<00:00:56.280> so<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:56.670> need<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.030> think

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
not as easy to do so you need to think

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.889 
not as easy to do so you need to think
of<00:00:57.360> some<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:58.280> factors<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.460> 32<00:00:59.820> where<00:01:00.690> that

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
of some of the factors of 32 where that

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.750 
of some of the factors of 32 where that
might<00:01:01.109> include<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.590> perfect<00:01:02.010> square<00:01:02.190> inside<00:01:02.609> of

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
might include a perfect square inside of

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.250 
might include a perfect square inside of
it<00:01:02.879> for<00:01:03.570> example<00:01:04.049> if<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:04.619> multiply<00:01:05.100> 16<00:01:06.260> times

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
it for example if you multiply 16 times

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.780 
it for example if you multiply 16 times
2<00:01:08.479> that<00:01:09.479> gives<00:01:09.780> you<00:01:09.930> 32<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.680> 16<00:01:11.490> is<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.729> perfect

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
2 that gives you 32 and 16 is a perfect

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.770 
2 that gives you 32 and 16 is a perfect
square<00:01:12.210> because<00:01:12.479> 4<00:01:13.170> times<00:01:13.470> 4<00:01:13.799> gives<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:14.159> 16

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
square because 4 times 4 gives you 16

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.570 
square because 4 times 4 gives you 16
you<00:01:15.780> also<00:01:16.020> have<00:01:16.380> this<00:01:16.590> x<00:01:16.830> squared<00:01:16.920> over<00:01:17.430> here

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
you also have this x squared over here

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.370 
you also have this x squared over here
to<00:01:17.700> worry<00:01:17.880> about<00:01:18.030> as<00:01:18.299> well<00:01:18.479> so<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.200> have<00:01:19.320> a

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
to worry about as well so you have a

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.859 
to worry about as well so you have a
perfect<00:01:19.619> square<00:01:20.100> here<00:01:20.240> you<00:01:21.240> have<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.420> perfect

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
perfect square here you have a perfect

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.050 
perfect square here you have a perfect
square<00:01:21.900> here<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.590> this<00:01:23.220> 2<00:01:23.430> is<00:01:23.610> not<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.909> perfect

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
square here and this 2 is not a perfect

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.200 
square here and this 2 is not a perfect
square<00:01:24.570> because<00:01:24.810> 1<00:01:25.770> times<00:01:26.009> 1<00:01:26.250> is<00:01:26.369> 1<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.820> 2

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
square because 1 times 1 is 1 and 2

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.370 
square because 1 times 1 is 1 and 2
times<00:01:27.450> 2<00:01:27.689> is<00:01:27.810> 4

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
times 2 is 4

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.469 
times 2 is 4
so<00:01:29.009> you're<00:01:29.159> looking<00:01:29.280> at<00:01:29.520> some<00:01:29.729> weird<00:01:29.970> decimal

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
so you're looking at some weird decimal

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.539 
so you're looking at some weird decimal
number<00:01:30.810> in<00:01:30.960> order<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.200> get<00:01:31.409> this<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:32.400> be<00:01:32.520> a

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
number in order to get this to be a

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.120 
number in order to get this to be a
perfect<00:01:33.000> square<00:01:33.090> so<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.259> 16<00:01:34.740> we're<00:01:34.950> going<00:01:35.070> to

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
perfect square so the 16 we're going to

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.780 
perfect square so the 16 we're going to
take<00:01:35.340> 4<00:01:36.000> times<00:01:36.270> 4<00:01:36.570> gives<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:37.770> 16<00:01:38.220> so<00:01:38.670> the

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
take 4 times 4 gives you 16 so the

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.420 
take 4 times 4 gives you 16 so the
square<00:01:39.060> root<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.360> 16<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:39.990> 4<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.920> square<00:01:41.159> root

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
square root of 16 is 4 the square root

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.810 
square root of 16 is 4 the square root
of<00:01:41.579> x<00:01:41.759> squared<00:01:42.090> x<00:01:42.360> times<00:01:42.750> X<00:01:43.280> is<00:01:44.280> here<00:01:44.670> and

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
of x squared x times X is here and

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.139 
of x squared x times X is here and
you're<00:01:45.329> left<00:01:45.600> over<00:01:45.869> with<00:01:46.140> this<00:01:46.979> non<00:01:47.579> perfect

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
you're left over with this non perfect

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.020 
you're left over with this non perfect
square<00:01:48.420> here<00:01:48.450> this<00:01:48.869> is<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:50.009> simplest<00:01:50.520> form<00:01:50.640> of

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
square here this is the simplest form of

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.780 
square here this is the simplest form of
our<00:01:51.810> 32<00:01:52.200> x<00:01:52.500> squared<00:01:52.860> in<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.189> radical<00:01:53.610> symbol

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
our 32 x squared in the radical symbol

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.520
