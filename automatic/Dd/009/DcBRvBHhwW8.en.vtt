controller<00:02:56.570> on<00:02:56.840> that<00:02:57.470> side<00:02:57.890> and<00:02:58.340> I<00:02:58.459> would

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
controller on that side and I would

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.240 
controller on that side and I would
assume<00:02:58.910> if<00:02:59.269> I<00:02:59.600> am<00:03:00.140> correct<00:03:01.070> I<00:03:02.140> have<00:03:03.140> a<00:03:03.170> USB<00:03:03.650> chat

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
assume if I am correct I have a USB chat

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.670 
assume if I am correct I have a USB chat
cable<00:03:04.760> right<00:03:05.000> here<00:03:05.030> that<00:03:05.450> I<00:03:05.570> can<00:03:05.630> use<00:03:05.989> for<00:03:06.440> my

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
cable right here that I can use for my

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.520 
cable right here that I can use for my
playstation<00:03:07.250> 3<00:03:07.820> I<00:03:08.090> would<00:03:08.870> assume<00:03:09.079> that<00:03:09.380> we'll

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
playstation 3 I would assume that we'll

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.590 
playstation 3 I would assume that we'll
probably<00:03:09.799> plug<00:03:10.280> in<00:03:10.489> right<00:03:10.700> there<00:03:11.000> in<00:03:11.180> the<00:03:11.209> USB

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
probably plug in right there in the USB

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.660 
probably plug in right there in the USB
outlet<00:03:13.060> and<00:03:14.060> let's<00:03:14.359> just

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
outlet and let's just

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.650 
outlet and let's just
check<00:03:14.819> this<00:03:15.030> out<00:03:15.240> this<00:03:15.540> is<00:03:15.690> the<00:03:15.840> actual<00:03:17.330> TX<00:03:18.330> for

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
check this out this is the actual TX for

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
check this out this is the actual TX for
the<00:03:18.750> mixamp<00:03:19.790> these<00:03:20.790> are<00:03:21.209> all<00:03:21.569> our<00:03:22.110> plugins

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
the mixamp these are all our plugins

hear in the back that's where auxiliary
in<00:03:25.920> ok<00:03:26.310> here's<00:03:26.489> where<00:03:26.640> our<00:03:26.670> power<00:03:27.000> cord<00:03:27.390> is

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
in ok here's where our power cord is

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.690 
in ok here's where our power cord is
going<00:03:27.599> to<00:03:27.690> plug<00:03:27.870> in<00:03:28.020> at<00:03:28.230> we've<00:03:28.500> got<00:03:28.709> optical<00:03:29.400> in

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
going to plug in at we've got optical in

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.040 
going to plug in at we've got optical in
and<00:03:29.970> optical<00:03:30.480> out<00:03:32.390> so<00:03:33.390> that's<00:03:33.630> pretty<00:03:33.959> cool

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
and optical out so that's pretty cool

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.100 
and optical out so that's pretty cool
we'll<00:03:35.010> have<00:03:35.160> to<00:03:35.190> maybe<00:03:36.120> do<00:03:36.360> another<00:03:36.390> set<00:03:37.020> up

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
we'll have to maybe do another set up

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.050 
we'll have to maybe do another set up

in the case we've got our pub we've got

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.830 
in the case we've got our pub we've got
a<00:05:12.750> wire<00:05:13.370> which<00:05:14.370> I'm<00:05:14.850> not<00:05:15.000> sure<00:05:15.240> exactly<00:05:15.600> what

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
a wire which I'm not sure exactly what

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:20.200 
a wire which I'm not sure exactly what
that<00:05:15.870> wires<00:05:16.260> going<00:05:16.560> to<00:05:16.620> do<00:05:16.970> there<00:05:17.970> are<00:05:18.330> the

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
that wires going to do there are the

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.030 
that wires going to do there are the
little<00:05:21.210> sound<00:05:21.979> mufflers

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:24.040 
little sound mufflers

another<00:05:25.040> set<00:05:25.370> of<00:05:25.460> wires<00:05:25.670> right<00:05:26.330> in<00:05:26.570> there<00:05:27.340> and

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
another set of wires right in there and

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.120 
another set of wires right in there and
most<00:05:29.120> importantly<00:05:29.720> here<00:05:30.170> is<00:05:30.290> our<00:05:30.500> microphone

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
most importantly here is our microphone

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.310 
most importantly here is our microphone
boom<00:05:31.370> which<00:05:31.970> you<00:05:32.300> can<00:05:32.480> actually<00:05:32.600> put<00:05:32.930> this<00:05:32.960> on

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.320 
boom which you can actually put this on
