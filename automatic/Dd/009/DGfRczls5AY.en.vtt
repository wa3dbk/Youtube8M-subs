00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.089
 He specified that they became aware of the whole situation 

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:12.319

 missing min 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:22.429
 which feeling 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:25.529
 He entered into the commitment acquired by his parents 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.780
 sources will inaugurate a new commitment 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.679
 what part of you 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:32.470

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.470
 his because

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.900
 separated from them 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.110
 in by also that 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.110
 separately from 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.590
 I can not continue 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.450
 with what I thought 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.310
 for what he tells you 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.690
 a kameni cameroon 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.530
 haha I asked if you should follow that path the same is another time not 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.730
 your time can not be the same crime 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.730
 Nowadays it can be said that it was clear a long time ago 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.820
 that themselves and rioja 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.820
 any wasted 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.460
 shortly after all 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.659
 portuondo sings because it removes natural light clear 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.700
 not for pleasure 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.900
 the club not for not for my story but for d 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.850
 besides the history of a product out of competition 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.400
 with how I think about how I am 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.930
 until now others 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.340
 soon but 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.240
 does not mean to be left-wing others either 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.880
 soros same difference neither the Celtic powel network of the only left 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.590
 is one of them that does very well 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.270
 basso is something that since only the true 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.650
 the teachers 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.670
 and you went to the 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.999
 in what raised the value and frontality 

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:58.950
 yes without doubt is who 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.180
 I never voted 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.430
 not even 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.570
 because from the first moment I realized about her family 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.219
 he had paid very dearly for politics 

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:10.999
 or as a boy 

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:13.349
 at age 13 I started saying what 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.729
 with people they point us that NATO 

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:17.809
 have other 

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:21.239
 because it was a good way to protect us deported 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.239
 in the elections just because I promised them to 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.279
 to 'the salao' in the one of d my lady very high 

00:02:28.279 --> 00:02:32.119
 highlights the belief that I never got to enter if the opposite 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:36.180
 the union of these boxes passages increasing in day is that a people that 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.869
 you 

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:38.000
 what happens 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.910
 but in political life in safe flight because palace in the flesh still 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.020
 political tension but 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.999
 the time has changed 

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:48.469
 quintero lara 

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:51.559
 the attitude of the right has not changed 

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:52.939
 your 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:55.249
 in the same fight 

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:58.159
 oppress the one who thinks differently 

00:02:58.159 --> 00:02:59.179
 ii 

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:00.769
 and think differently and think 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.139
 as it is to carry forward some 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:06.729
 but in a democracy like the one that is lived 

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:09.359
 with a government with the majority that you have 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:14.459
 that is to say if the democratic regime is strengthened every day 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.829
 daily with the work of not only the rulers and not of 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:22.279
 each one of us percent in short 

00:03:22.279 --> 00:03:25.859
 The situation can also be modified 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:30.619
 all the extremes are bad and that's not why I'm going to vote for weapons so that 

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:34.339
 they said that it was global commitment making you compromise anything 

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:36.949
 new because that money 

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:39.909
 that's what we want all former presidents 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:41.179
 in short for nothing 

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:42.709
 thank you 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.079
 the new one to eses 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:47.079
 every time we have then an exaggeration quintero 

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:52.639
 I think that this democratic society exaggerate 

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:55.639
 waiting for what he expects and putting him in power 

00:03:56.289 --> 00:04:00.289
 and taking away the guilt of others takes care of that at their own weight on top of 

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:01.549
 each person 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:03.469
 titans is important 

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:06.879
 reflects what you are saying 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:07.930
 Madrid 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:09.029
 the sales 

00:04:09.029 --> 00:04:13.040
 believe that we are not believe in democracy only when we vote and 

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:15.879
 then we do not assume responsibility for each of the facts that he wants 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:18.879
 vote and they represent us sanz I had a clean time 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:23.220
 You start brutal and all for the lack of housing 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.930
 It's all because we'll take care of them, but what happens is that we have a 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.930
 terrible fear of living 

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:34.729
 but there are a lot of people who will take care of the cattle nothing from those 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:39.240
 box boxes although say sitting at a table all Argentines agree 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.190
 I think I took others step by step 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.529
 they accuse him when we say it's nothing they say they do not know 

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:47.529
 not the torrent of totoral leave it behind efe 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.819
 and has slight amaral expose before xerez when they see death so close 

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:57.020
 very well 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.020
 all that process 

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:02.199
 this club invites gentlemen
