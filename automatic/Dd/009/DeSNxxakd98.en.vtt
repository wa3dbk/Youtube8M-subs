braid<00:00:25.590> you're<00:00:25.920> just<00:00:26.099> going<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.400> take<00:00:26.580> this

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
braid you're just going to take this

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.700 
braid you're just going to take this
hair<00:00:27.000> because<00:00:27.630> you're<00:00:27.869> only<00:00:28.019> adding<00:00:28.230> hair<00:00:28.590> to

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
hair because you're only adding hair to

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.279 
hair because you're only adding hair to
one<00:00:28.980> section<00:00:29.310> so<00:00:30.060> you're<00:00:30.330> just<00:00:30.449> going<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.689> lap

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
one section so you're just going to lap

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.080 
one section so you're just going to lap
that<00:00:31.529> in<00:00:31.710> without<00:00:31.949> adding<00:00:32.460> any<00:00:32.640> other<00:00:32.850> hair

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
that in without adding any other hair

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.830 
that in without adding any other hair
but<00:00:33.899> when<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:34.710> get<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:34.980> top<00:00:35.130> section<00:00:35.460> or<00:00:36.030> C

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
but when you get to the top section or C

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.740 
but when you get to the top section or C
I<00:00:37.110> think<00:00:37.500> this<00:00:37.860> is<00:00:37.950> C<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:39.000> take<00:00:39.210> hair<00:00:39.510> from<00:00:39.660> the

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
I think this is C you take hair from the

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.680 
I think this is C you take hair from the
top<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.500> do<00:00:40.710> add<00:00:40.860> it<00:00:41.040> in<00:00:41.160> like<00:00:42.030> that<00:00:42.480> and

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
top and you do add it in like that and

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.660 
top and you do add it in like that and
you<00:00:43.020> take<00:00:43.170> it<00:00:43.320> over<00:00:43.379> piece<00:00:44.000> B<00:00:45.379> and<00:00:46.379> now<00:00:47.100> you're

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
you take it over piece B and now you're

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.520 
you take it over piece B and now you're
just<00:00:47.879> again<00:00:48.180> you're<00:00:48.840> not<00:00:48.960> adding<00:00:49.140> any<00:00:49.410> hair

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530
