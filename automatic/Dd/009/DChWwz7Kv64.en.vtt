00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.180
 story because I'm going to show you a 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:33.190
 mystery 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:37.980
 stress is pretty weird is a doll 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.980

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.379

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.780
 is here in this part of the map to 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.850
 than the others and that in the spaces 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.070
 God I hate that black has put on 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.329

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.670
 it's a black car and here you see that several 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.989
 doors and all are closed it's worth 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.970
 except those, so you can see what happens in 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.340
 ends where fast and notice that there 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.630
 They are very snow does not know 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.300
 exactly what you can get to 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.300
 mean of shooting disappears 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.120
 to exactly I do not know what it can mean 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.530
 this interest but it's a little weird 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.530
 put a snowman with some boxes 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.050

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.520
 a little weird what do you want me to tell you 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.520
 when exploding or something 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.500

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.500

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:42.480

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.220
 nothing black there is no more to say about 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.230
 this interest that I know nothing if you know 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.170
 something some history or some mystery 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:51.750
 I would like to know about this because I 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.240
 when I saw him I said seriously seriously 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.400
 and I'm still freaking out because he met me and he 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.390
 has turned a black is that I do not understand 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:03.070
 my car was not black 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.510
 and the back to painted 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:12.470
 and nothing black with this I say goodbye 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:12.470
 a greeting and I hope that the former favorite 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.680
 but because you're black I do not understand 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.870
 my car is not black 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.780
 and nothing people have said I hope there 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.780
 more videos from the channel 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.160

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.270

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.170
 evidently 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:38.490
 and anything with this I say goodbye and greetings 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.490
