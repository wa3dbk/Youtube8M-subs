that's<00:02:44.609> my<00:02:44.760> Lego<00:02:44.939> Marvel<00:02:45.389> collection<00:02:45.900> I<00:02:46.079> would

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
that's my Lego Marvel collection I would

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.420 
that's my Lego Marvel collection I would
estimate<00:02:47.040> it's<00:02:47.519> worth<00:02:47.609> probably<00:02:48.180> close<00:02:48.870> to

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
estimate it's worth probably close to

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.439 
estimate it's worth probably close to
well<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:51.000> Quinjet<00:02:51.239> is<00:02:51.510> like<00:02:51.719> 100<00:02:52.709> and<00:02:53.010> then

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:53.449 
well the Quinjet is like 100 and then

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:59.659 
well the Quinjet is like 100 and then
Malibu's<00:02:54.449> and<00:02:55.290> say<00:02:55.980> maybe<00:02:56.159> 200<00:02:58.040> 200<00:02:59.040> something

00:02:59.659 --> 00:02:59.669 
Malibu's and say maybe 200 200 something

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:05.979 
Malibu's and say maybe 200 200 something
would<00:03:00.629> be<00:03:00.719> two<00:03:00.840> hundred<00:03:00.870> and<00:03:02.989> two<00:03:03.989> hundred<00:03:04.019> and

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
would be two hundred and two hundred and

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.159 
would be two hundred and two hundred and
twenty-five<00:03:06.989> dollars<00:03:07.019> I'm<00:03:07.799> estimating

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:09.169 
twenty-five dollars I'm estimating

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:11.240 
twenty-five dollars I'm estimating
that's<00:03:10.169> how<00:03:10.379> much<00:03:10.500> I'm<00:03:10.680> guessing<00:03:10.980> it's<00:03:11.069> worth

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
that's how much I'm guessing it's worth

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.189 
that's how much I'm guessing it's worth
because<00:03:11.669> you<00:03:11.849> know<00:03:12.000> Quinn<00:03:12.299> jet<00:03:12.480> it's<00:03:12.629> like<00:03:12.750> 100

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:13.199 
because you know Quinn jet it's like 100

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:15.199 
because you know Quinn jet it's like 100
and<00:03:13.349> then<00:03:13.469> Malibu<00:03:14.010> mansion<00:03:14.189> 50<00:03:14.939> and<00:03:15.120> then

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
and then Malibu mansion 50 and then

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:19.009 
and then Malibu mansion 50 and then
everything<00:03:15.599> else<00:03:15.750> probably<00:03:16.250> close<00:03:17.250> to<00:03:17.519> 75<00:03:18.090> so

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:19.019 
everything else probably close to 75 so

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.179
