of<00:00:19.350> how<00:00:19.410> this<00:00:19.740> works<00:00:20.070> it<00:00:20.850> can<00:00:21.060> be<00:00:21.180> used<00:00:21.359> for

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
of how this works it can be used for

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.250 
of how this works it can be used for
many<00:00:22.199> different<00:00:22.500> applications<00:00:23.269> our<00:00:24.269> next
