going<00:01:08.000> on<00:01:08.090> here<00:01:08.360> I<00:01:08.780> mean<00:01:09.350> this<00:01:09.440> is<00:01:09.649> the<00:01:10.060> it's<00:01:11.060> an

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:11.300 
going on here I mean this is the it's an

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
electric barbecue and an outside fridge

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.790 
electric barbecue and an outside fridge

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800 
so it's what we've done away with is all

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.380 
so it's what we've done away with is all
the<00:01:15.950> gas<00:01:16.130> on<00:01:16.399> board<00:01:16.670> so<00:01:16.850> everything<00:01:17.180> is<00:01:17.270> either

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
the gas on board so everything is either

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.359 
the gas on board so everything is either
diesel<00:01:17.960> fight<00:01:18.200> or<00:01:18.410> electric<00:01:18.860> on<00:01:19.009> this<00:01:19.160> vehicle

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369

and they're machined up so I can send
them<00:04:07.209> anywhere<00:04:07.480> yeah<00:04:08.440> and<00:04:09.250> at<00:04:09.370> the<00:04:09.430> bottom<00:04:09.700> of

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
them anywhere yeah and at the bottom of

them anywhere yeah and at the bottom of
the<00:04:09.849> partition<00:04:10.450> I<00:04:10.599> noticed<00:04:11.049> you've<00:04:11.170> got<00:04:11.319> clear

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
the partition I noticed you've got clear

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.210 
the partition I noticed you've got clear
plastic<00:04:12.420> okay<00:04:13.420> I<00:04:13.660> mean<00:04:13.900> we've<00:04:14.140> evolved<00:04:14.980> from

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
plastic okay I mean we've evolved from

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:16.770 
plastic okay I mean we've evolved from
black<00:04:15.459> rubber<00:04:15.849> now<00:04:16.150> and<00:04:16.329> I<00:04:16.359> think<00:04:16.419> we've<00:04:16.690> gone

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
black rubber now and I think we've gone

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.420
