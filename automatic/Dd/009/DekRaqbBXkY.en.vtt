00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
without having to go all the way down to

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.220 
without having to go all the way down to
the<00:00:56.740> to<00:00:57.940> power<00:00:58.940> and<00:00:59.390> then<00:00:59.600> ride<00:00:59.870> the<00:00:59.900> elevator

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.200 
the to power and then ride the elevator
up<00:01:00.500> so<00:01:00.950> this<00:01:01.100> just<00:01:01.280> makes<00:01:01.520> it<00:01:01.730> a<00:01:01.790> hundred<00:01:02.060> times

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
up so this just makes it a hundred times

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.669 
up so this just makes it a hundred times
easier<00:01:02.840> to<00:01:03.110> do<00:01:03.260> this<00:01:03.440> um<00:01:05.049> so<00:01:06.049> yeah<00:01:06.439> I<00:01:06.619> would

00:01:06.669 --> 00:01:06.679 
easier to do this um so yeah I would

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:10.270 
easier to do this um so yeah I would
definitely<00:01:06.950> recommend<00:01:07.490> it<00:01:07.939> and<00:01:08.210> you<00:01:09.140> can<00:01:09.439> get
