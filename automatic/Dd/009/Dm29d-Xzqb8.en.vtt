00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.370
 hi friends good morning I hope you are 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:07.250
 all good and good today I'm going to bring 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.860
 a video that lost less many times 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:12.890
 many people in the comments 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.920
 well this video is about how to put the 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:19.190
 dock in the form of a cover flow as 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.560
 I can appreciate there have I done 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.420
 several multi- click tutorial videos 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.430
 and the comments come many people 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.800
 they ask me how to do this I've 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.840
 answered in the comments but there 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.940
 other people who have not seen it and I 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.220
 keep asking why I've decided 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.950
 do what is this video so that 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.690
 all of you know how to do it and 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.870
 can have what is this appearance 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.370
 just as I have it and to do 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.230
 this first thing we have to do is 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.980
 have an application called screen to 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:51.469
 my is this application is very brief by 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.980
 say so very famous because it allows you to 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:57.820
 modify your phone 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:01.059
 in several aspects and one of that is what 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.579
 what is the doc and this application is 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:07.810
 find and palencia in the network by font 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:10.360
 Puntocom yacht and let's start once 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.160
 that you have installed it 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.170
 llama we are going to address what they are 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:18.090
 settings 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.090
 let's look down 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:24.180
 whoever says the sprint mais here is what 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.580
 we are going to open 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.700
 and here we will activate it for the first time 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.400
 yes, if you have not had it 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.130
 we activate and as you can see we have 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.950
 several categories to be able to modify 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.930
 we have animations in which we can 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.380
 leave some animation when 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:49.580
 do what is the screen but you are in 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.580
 save but unlock the device 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:56.820
 but what we are interested in is the 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:59.880
 2nd so we are going to open the 2 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.820
 and let's go if we want to hide what they are 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.040
 the names of the applications we're going 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.990
 to give orders to hide label we're going 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.390
 to activate 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.910
 and we're going to use the number 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:15.209
 we activate it and we will 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:19.319
 we put five icons here we can choose 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:23.310
 from 1 to 10 so we 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:25.620
 we choose in kobe with or we go back 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.620
 remember to have the option to use 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.599
 personalized number activated and once 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.510
 done that ends shortly you will appreciate 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:36.440
 that that coverflow effect we 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:40.500
 we activate this option and change 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:44.880
 we simply put in mode such as 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:48.840
 is here we activate the dynamic ones and you 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:52.590
 we give in apla and we give in keeping a 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:55.049
 Once done that, the dock of you is going to 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.959
 appear as I have it here and 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.549
 there a question of tastes to modify the 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:03.660
 icons that you want to add the 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:07.110
 applications and good - that would be all 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:11.790
 it's very simple to put this very simple 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:15.240
 and it works on iphone ipod touch and ipad 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.950
 in version of 5.0 forward equally 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.500
 because that has been everything I hope that you 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.470
