would like to see and I think certainly

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.230 
would like to see and I think certainly
the<00:01:39.259> IOC<00:01:40.259> has<00:01:40.290> failed<00:01:40.950> in<00:01:41.100> that<00:01:41.130> regard<00:01:41.490> your

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
the IOC has failed in that regard your

the IOC has failed in that regard your

Olympic champion of course you're there

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.160 
Olympic champion of course you're there
to<00:01:43.829> compete<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.250> there<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.520> win<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:44.990> you<00:01:45.990> have

to compete you there to win and you have

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.530 
to compete you there to win and you have
but<00:01:47.130> when<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.579> look<00:01:47.729> at<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:47.850> should<00:01:48.119> athletes

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
but when you look at it should athletes

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.420 
but when you look at it should athletes
ever<00:01:48.750> boycott<00:01:49.290> games<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:49.950> an<00:01:50.040> effective

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
ever boycott games is it an effective

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.389 
ever boycott games is it an effective
way<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.610> handle<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.329> situation<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:52.110> know<00:01:52.229> I

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
way to handle the situation you know I

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:54.410 
way to handle the situation you know I
again<00:01:53.399> perhaps<00:01:53.670> i'm<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.970> bit<00:01:54.090> biased<00:01:54.210> because

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
again perhaps i'm a bit biased because

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.179 
again perhaps i'm a bit biased because
i've<00:01:54.600> been<00:01:54.810> two<00:01:55.200> times<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.619> the<00:01:55.710> olympics<00:01:56.070> and

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
i've been two times to the olympics and

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.100 
i've been two times to the olympics and
what<00:01:56.310> I<00:01:56.340> found<00:01:56.520> was<00:01:56.670> this<00:01:56.939> had<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.450> not<00:01:57.689> gone<00:01:57.960> to

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
what I found was this had I not gone to

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.899 
what I found was this had I not gone to
the<00:01:58.170> Olympics<00:01:58.290> in<00:01:58.560> Torino<00:01:58.950> my<00:01:59.250> local<00:01:59.759> paper

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
the Olympics in Torino my local paper

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.370 
the Olympics in Torino my local paper
may<00:02:00.090> have<00:02:00.210> said<00:02:00.390> local<00:02:00.810> boy<00:02:00.990> fur<00:02:01.259> goes

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
may have said local boy fur goes

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.499 
may have said local boy fur goes
Olympics<00:02:01.829> for<00:02:01.890> cause<00:02:02.189> but<00:02:02.909> because<00:02:03.180> I<00:02:03.299> went

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
Olympics for cause but because I went

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.560 
Olympics for cause but because I went
there<00:02:03.659> I<00:02:03.689> was<00:02:03.750> successful<00:02:04.409> because<00:02:04.560> I

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
there I was successful because I

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.230 
there I was successful because I
believe<00:02:06.320> I<00:02:06.440> I<00:02:06.470> had<00:02:07.430> the<00:02:07.520> right<00:02:07.670> message<00:02:08.090> in

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
believe I I had the right message in

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.790 
believe I I had the right message in
front<00:02:08.360> of<00:02:08.479> the<00:02:08.539> media<00:02:08.690> I<00:02:09.020> was<00:02:09.410> able<00:02:09.500> to<00:02:09.679> reach

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
front of the media I was able to reach

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.590 
front of the media I was able to reach
more<00:02:10.670> than<00:02:10.850> more<00:02:11.060> than<00:02:11.090> a<00:02:11.210> billion<00:02:11.390> people

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
more than more than a billion people

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.240 
more than more than a billion people
around<00:02:11.810> the<00:02:11.960> world<00:02:12.110> we<00:02:12.320> raised<00:02:12.530> more<00:02:13.100> than<00:02:13.130> a

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
around the world we raised more than a

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.920 
around the world we raised more than a
million<00:02:13.430> dollars<00:02:13.760> for<00:02:14.090> for<00:02:14.360> refugees<00:02:14.750> from

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
million dollars for for refugees from

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.750 
million dollars for for refugees from
Darfur<00:02:15.260> so<00:02:15.740> I<00:02:15.770> think<00:02:15.860> what<00:02:16.040> you<00:02:16.130> can<00:02:16.280> do<00:02:16.459> is<00:02:16.610> you

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
Darfur so I think what you can do is you

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.340 
Darfur so I think what you can do is you
can<00:02:16.790> use<00:02:16.940> that<00:02:17.180> spotlight<00:02:17.630> to<00:02:17.810> amplify<00:02:18.320> your

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
can use that spotlight to amplify your

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.230 
can use that spotlight to amplify your
message<00:02:18.770> that's<00:02:19.010> what<00:02:19.459> I<00:02:19.490> tried<00:02:19.760> well<00:02:20.090> some

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
message that's what I tried well some

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.430 
message that's what I tried well some
have<00:02:20.390> done<00:02:20.630> that<00:02:20.780> but<00:02:20.959> do<00:02:21.080> you<00:02:21.170> feel<00:02:21.290> light

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
have done that but do you feel light

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.720 
have done that but do you feel light
enough<00:02:21.620> athletes<00:02:22.010> look<00:02:22.220> at<00:02:22.340> the<00:02:22.459> political

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
enough athletes look at the political

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.310 
enough athletes look at the political
impact<00:02:23.120> of<00:02:23.300> what<00:02:23.330> they<00:02:23.570> can<00:02:23.750> do<00:02:23.930> and<00:02:23.959> what<00:02:24.170> they

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
impact of what they can do and what they

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.410 
impact of what they can do and what they
do<00:02:24.380> I<00:02:24.709> certainly<00:02:25.490> hope<00:02:25.730> that<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:26.180> more

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
do I certainly hope that the more

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.330 
do I certainly hope that the more
athletes<00:02:26.750> will<00:02:27.260> realize<00:02:27.650> that<00:02:27.680> position<00:02:28.250> I

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
athletes will realize that position I

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.880 
athletes will realize that position I
personally<00:02:28.730> think<00:02:28.880> that<00:02:29.000> citizens<00:02:29.890> athlete

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
personally think that citizens athlete

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.310 
personally think that citizens athlete
or<00:02:31.010> not<00:02:31.160> and<00:02:31.430> and<00:02:31.640> well<00:02:32.600> known<00:02:32.810> or<00:02:32.959> not<00:02:33.080> should

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
or not and and well known or not should

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.050 
or not and and well known or not should
take<00:02:33.470> the<00:02:33.590> responsibility<00:02:33.680> to<00:02:34.280> to<00:02:34.730> promote

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
take the responsibility to to promote

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.430 
take the responsibility to to promote
the<00:02:35.209> values<00:02:35.240> and<00:02:35.630> morals<00:02:35.959> they<00:02:36.080> believe<00:02:36.320> or

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
the values and morals they believe or

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.190 
the values and morals they believe or
acura<00:02:36.800> are<00:02:37.070> right<00:02:37.630> so<00:02:38.630> I<00:02:38.660> certainly<00:02:39.020> think

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
acura are right so I certainly think

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.840 
acura are right so I certainly think
that<00:02:39.320> more<00:02:39.530> athletes<00:02:39.770> could<00:02:40.040> take<00:02:40.250> an<00:02:40.550> active

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
that more athletes could take an active

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.630 
that more athletes could take an active
role<00:02:40.880> but<00:02:41.840> I<00:02:41.870> understand<00:02:42.650> that<00:02:42.770> that<00:02:43.250> at<00:02:43.489> the

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
role but I understand that that at the

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.740 
role but I understand that that at the
Olympic<00:02:43.910> Games<00:02:43.940> some<00:02:44.270> athletes<00:02:44.540> are<00:02:44.630> not
