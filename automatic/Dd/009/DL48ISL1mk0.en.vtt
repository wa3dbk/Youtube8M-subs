00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.919
 what are we going to find in the box 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:16.160
 when we open this smart hair 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:18.560
 and well first of all of course we have 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.599
 found the watch with its lighting that 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.099
 allows him to be readable even in the 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:24.080
 greater darkness 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:27.259
 we will continue the opening of 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.779
 this box with the discovery of a 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:31.550
 usb cord that will recharge 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.520
 our watch by a direct connection 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.260
 on a computer or on a charger and 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.300
 we will also find a way 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.740
 which will help to find the 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.780
 information for the first connection 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.850
 and the first setting of love 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.670
 like everything shows connected interest 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:49.250
 main of the smart touch 2 of sony and 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.140
 to be able to control almost all 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:54.920
 functions of a range phone 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.290
 xperia sony is a watch that 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.960
 runs under an operating system 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.730
 android 4.0 and so to recover the 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.369
 main functions just enough 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.829
 to press the house key the key 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:08.750
 home that will allow me to find 

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:11.270
 the different functions that are 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.890
 preinstalled with for example access 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.679
 social networks such as facebook 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.399
 some twitter i'm going to find my 

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:18.049
 calendar 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:20.359
 I also have the opportunity to 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.049
 recover all my emails and 

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:24.350
 view them 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:27.649
 I also have the possibility when an email 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.329
 happens to ask here for the transfer of 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:31.399
 this mail directly on the screen of my 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:33.200
 phone to see it in a way 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:35.390
 much simpler 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.920
 backwards as on any element 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.170
 from android 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.549
 the touch screen allows navigation 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.829
 very fluid 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:45.380
 when I will receive a call and 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:47.509
 well this call I have the opportunity to 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.670
 pick up straight from my 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.399
 screen and the communication will be 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.880
 transferred either on my sony smartphone 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:57.289
 or on my android smartphone for that matter 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.209
 or also I have the opportunity to 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:01.780
 take the communication simply 

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:04.280
 with a bluetooth headset 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.229
 the first association with the 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.789
 phone that will be attached to this 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.530
 watch is extremely simple 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:11.690
 since she uses the new 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.900
 bluetooth technology nfc for near 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.989
 field release 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.790
 sean and the simple the simple act of 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.829
 vices and the watch on the back of the 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.650
 phone will launch the 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:24.540
 pairing process it's a watch 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.930
 who is waterproof in the rain she 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.790
 enjoys ip54 protection like 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.510
 besides a lot of sony phones 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.000
 xperia 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.480
 it is compatible with any phone 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.060
 android 4.0 and the big interest of this 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.000
 shows is to be able to access via 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.250
 google likes a catalog 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.180
 about 250 applications 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.180
 applications
