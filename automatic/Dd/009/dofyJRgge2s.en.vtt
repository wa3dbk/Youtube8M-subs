00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
incredible stuff I phone so this is so

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.859 
incredible stuff I phone so this is so
easy<00:00:22.830> so<00:00:23.820> let's<00:00:24.000> begin<00:00:24.150> with<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.449> smoothie

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
easy so let's begin with the smoothie

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.839 
easy so let's begin with the smoothie
now<00:00:25.199> you<00:00:25.260> start<00:00:25.650> with<00:00:25.800> 1<00:00:26.099> cup<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.519> rainwater

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
now you start with 1 cup of rainwater

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.910 
now you start with 1 cup of rainwater
now<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:27.599> know<00:00:27.720> it<00:00:27.930> looks<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.170> little<00:00:28.289> murky<00:00:28.560> but

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
now I know it looks a little murky but

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.500 
now I know it looks a little murky but
it's<00:00:29.099> just<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.460> natural<00:00:29.640> elements<00:00:30.000> and

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
it's just the natural elements and

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.780 
it's just the natural elements and
actually<00:00:30.929> this<00:00:31.109> is<00:00:31.320> nature's<00:00:31.920> distilled

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
actually this is nature's distilled

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.340 
actually this is nature's distilled
water<00:00:33.090> so<00:00:33.329> it's<00:00:33.450> really<00:00:33.719> easy<00:00:34.020> for<00:00:34.140> ourselves

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
water so it's really easy for ourselves

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.130 
water so it's really easy for ourselves
to<00:00:34.829> absorb<00:00:38.329> next<00:00:39.329> I<00:00:39.480> got<00:00:39.629> a<00:00:39.660> whole<00:00:39.809> bunch<00:00:40.020> of

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
to absorb next I got a whole bunch of

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.740 
to absorb next I got a whole bunch of
grass<00:00:40.410> most<00:00:41.129> mammals<00:00:41.399> eat<00:00:41.790> grass<00:00:42.030> so<00:00:42.390> we<00:00:42.540> can

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
grass most mammals eat grass so we can

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.840 
grass most mammals eat grass so we can
too<00:00:42.989> it's<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.500> great<00:00:43.770> source<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.219> chlorophyll

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
too it's a great source of chlorophyll

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.670 
too it's a great source of chlorophyll
hopefully<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.809> job<00:00:45.989> didn't<00:00:46.320> pee<00:00:46.440> on<00:00:46.469> this

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
hopefully the job didn't pee on this

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.660 
hopefully the job didn't pee on this
batch<00:00:47.930> then<00:00:48.930> I've<00:00:49.110> got<00:00:49.320> some<00:00:49.680> dirt<00:00:50.039> now<00:00:50.520> this

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
batch then I've got some dirt now this

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.100 
batch then I've got some dirt now this
might<00:00:50.820> sound<00:00:51.000> gross<00:00:51.329> but<00:00:51.690> if<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:51.840> think<00:00:52.050> about

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
might sound gross but if you think about

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.170 
might sound gross but if you think about
it<00:00:52.289> dirt<00:00:52.860> is<00:00:53.010> loaded<00:00:53.520> with<00:00:53.550> soil<00:00:53.940> based

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
it dirt is loaded with soil based

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.910 
it dirt is loaded with soil based
organisms<00:00:55.050> which<00:00:55.199> is<00:00:55.350> really<00:00:55.530> good<00:00:55.680> for<00:00:55.829> the

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
organisms which is really good for the

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.310 
organisms which is really good for the
gut<00:00:56.160> it's<00:00:56.699> high<00:00:56.969> in<00:00:57.000> iron<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:58.050> makes<00:00:58.230> a

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
gut it's high in iron and it makes a

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.430 
gut it's high in iron and it makes a
nice<00:00:58.590> addition<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.579> any<00:00:59.789> smoothie<00:01:00.359> then<00:01:01.109> I

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
nice addition to any smoothie then I

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.560 
nice addition to any smoothie then I
found<00:01:01.590> some<00:01:01.800> really<00:01:01.920> thick<00:01:02.370> twigs<00:01:03.000> now<00:01:03.329> these

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
found some really thick twigs now these

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.260 
found some really thick twigs now these
are<00:01:03.840> great<00:01:04.170> because<00:01:04.350> they<00:01:04.710> are<00:01:04.890> prebiotics<00:01:05.820> so

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
are great because they are prebiotics so

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.240 
are great because they are prebiotics so
they<00:01:06.390> feed<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:06.900> good<00:01:07.229> bacteria<00:01:07.470> in<00:01:07.830> our<00:01:07.950> guts

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
they feed that good bacteria in our guts

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.640 
they feed that good bacteria in our guts
they<00:01:08.760> also<00:01:08.970> high<00:01:09.390> an<00:01:09.570> insoluble<00:01:10.049> fiber<00:01:12.080> then<00:01:13.080> I

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
they also high an insoluble fiber then I

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.520 
they also high an insoluble fiber then I
found<00:01:13.950> this<00:01:14.130> juicy<00:01:14.970> cockroach<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:15.930> know<00:01:16.380> that

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530

sounds gross but you heard it here first

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.270 
sounds gross but you heard it here first
bugs<00:01:19.770> are<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.430> protein<00:01:20.970> of<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.210> future<00:01:22.280> then

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
bugs are the protein of the future then

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.609 
bugs are the protein of the future then
I<00:01:23.310> got<00:01:23.729> some<00:01:23.970> berries<00:01:24.450> hopefully<00:01:25.350> they're<00:01:25.500> not

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
I got some berries hopefully they're not

I got some berries hopefully they're not
poisonous<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:27.080> then<00:01:28.080> finally<00:01:28.350> some<00:01:29.250> rocks

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
poisonous and then finally some rocks

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.630 
poisonous and then finally some rocks
now<00:01:30.240> if<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.420> think<00:01:30.720> about<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:31.049> our<00:01:31.640> magnesium

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
now if you think about it our magnesium

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.730 
now if you think about it our magnesium
our<00:01:32.909> calcium<00:01:33.210> supplements<00:01:33.960> most<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.439> them<00:01:34.560> are

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
our calcium supplements most of them are

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.010 
our calcium supplements most of them are
derived<00:01:35.130> from<00:01:35.280> rock<00:01:35.729> so<00:01:36.299> this<00:01:36.479> is<00:01:36.509> total<00:01:37.049> DIY

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
derived from rock so this is total DIY

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:45.460 
derived from rock so this is total DIY
alright<00:01:40.020> lets<00:01:40.290> blend<00:01:40.590> away

this in your Blendtec blender these
things<00:01:59.360> are<00:01:59.570> crazy<00:01:59.930> powerful<00:02:00.440> if<00:02:00.890> I<00:02:01.040> gave<00:02:01.220> a

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
things are crazy powerful if I gave a

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.070 
things are crazy powerful if I gave a
whole<00:02:01.460> video<00:02:01.670> series<00:02:02.210> called<00:02:02.240> will<00:02:02.660> it<00:02:02.810> blend

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
whole video series called will it blend

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.990 
whole video series called will it blend
have<00:02:03.470> you<00:02:03.560> ever<00:02:03.680> seen<00:02:03.890> it<00:02:04.010> they<00:02:04.550> pulverize
