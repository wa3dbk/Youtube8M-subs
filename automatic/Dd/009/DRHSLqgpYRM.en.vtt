00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
someone just redo a certain test you

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.060 
someone just redo a certain test you
know<00:04:11.300> you<00:04:11.660> know<00:04:11.780> that<00:04:11.930> how<00:04:12.050> money<00:04:12.290> medically

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:13.070 
know you know that how money medically

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.630 
know you know that how money medically
evaluated<00:04:13.340> everybody<00:04:14.000> thoroughly<00:04:14.390> so<00:04:15.640> my

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:16.640 
evaluated everybody thoroughly so my

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.570 
evaluated everybody thoroughly so my
tests<00:04:16.880> showed<00:04:17.270> it<00:04:17.480> they<00:04:18.170> did<00:04:18.320> an<00:04:18.440> EKG<00:04:18.530> EKG<00:04:19.400> and

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:19.580 
tests showed it they did an EKG EKG and

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:22.950 
tests showed it they did an EKG EKG and
echo<00:04:20.000> and<00:04:20.570> then<00:04:20.810> they<00:04:21.049> gave<00:04:21.470> me<00:04:21.680> like<00:04:21.799> a<00:04:21.830> IV<00:04:22.280> and

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
echo and then they gave me like a IV and

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.540 
echo and then they gave me like a IV and
they<00:04:23.960> put<00:04:24.170> like<00:04:24.350> some<00:04:24.560> kind<00:04:24.830> of<00:04:24.920> bubble<00:04:25.250> fluid

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
they put like some kind of bubble fluid

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.320 
they put like some kind of bubble fluid
and<00:04:25.730> i<00:04:26.360> guess<00:04:26.570> the<00:04:26.600> way<00:04:26.930> the<00:04:27.620> bubble<00:04:27.920> fluid

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
and i guess the way the bubble fluid

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.270 
and i guess the way the bubble fluid
enters<00:04:29.330> my<00:04:29.660> heart<00:04:29.930> and<00:04:30.230> my<00:04:30.410> bloodstream<00:04:30.740> in<00:04:31.190> my

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
enters my heart and my bloodstream in my

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.490 
enters my heart and my bloodstream in my
oxygen<00:04:31.640> strength<00:04:32.000> the<00:04:32.420> way<00:04:32.570> interest<00:04:33.020> lets

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
oxygen strength the way interest lets

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.840 
oxygen strength the way interest lets
him<00:04:33.590> know<00:04:33.650> that<00:04:33.890> that<00:04:34.010> for<00:04:34.100> episode<00:04:34.400> you<00:04:34.670> can't

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
him know that that for episode you can't

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.580 
him know that that for episode you can't
even<00:04:34.940> see<00:04:35.180> it<00:04:35.240> on<00:04:35.330> the<00:04:35.390> screen<00:04:35.420> as<00:04:36.260> to<00:04:36.440> whether
