00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
at the top just to change some of the

at the top just to change some of the
flyaways<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.480> I<00:00:51.690> also<00:00:51.899> put<00:00:52.470> in<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:53.130> little

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
flyaways and I also put in a little

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.090

powder<00:00:53.880> into<00:00:54.329> my<00:00:54.690> part<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.470> make<00:00:55.500> it<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.950> little

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
powder into my part to make it a little

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.000 
powder into my part to make it a little
more<00:00:56.220> defined<00:00:56.870> but<00:00:57.870> other<00:00:58.020> than<00:00:58.200> that<00:00:58.260> this<00:00:58.649> is

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
more defined but other than that this is

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.660 
more defined but other than that this is
the<00:00:59.700> natural<00:00:59.910> texture<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.870> hair<00:01:01.219> I<00:01:02.219> have

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
the natural texture of the hair I have

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.030 
the natural texture of the hair I have
not<00:01:02.880> washed<00:01:03.239> his<00:01:03.660> hair<00:01:03.930> or<00:01:04.199> conditioning<00:01:04.830> yet

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
not washed his hair or conditioning yet

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.370 
not washed his hair or conditioning yet
so<00:01:05.280> i'm<00:01:05.369> not<00:01:05.520> sure<00:01:05.880> if<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.479> will<00:01:06.600> keep<00:01:06.869> this

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
so i'm not sure if it will keep this

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.180 
so i'm not sure if it will keep this
texture<00:01:07.979> after<00:01:08.369> his<00:01:08.460> wet<00:01:08.729> but<00:01:09.270> so<00:01:09.420> far<00:01:09.660> i<00:01:09.990> do

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190

so far I'm really really liking the

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.399 
so far I'm really really liking the
texture<00:01:25.799> I<00:01:25.830> hope<00:01:26.220> it<00:01:26.400> does<00:01:26.580> stay<00:01:27.200> after<00:01:28.200> it's

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
texture I hope it does stay after it's

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.240 
texture I hope it does stay after it's
wet<00:01:28.860> because<00:01:29.340> it's<00:01:29.580> really<00:01:29.939> really<00:01:30.180> pretty

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250

now<00:02:34.630> I'm<00:02:34.780> really<00:02:35.380> like<00:02:35.710> the<00:02:36.100> waviness<00:02:36.640> of<00:02:37.030> it<00:02:37.360> I

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
now I'm really like the waviness of it I

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.970 
now I'm really like the waviness of it I
was<00:02:38.680> going<00:02:39.280> to<00:02:39.580> die<00:02:39.940> this<00:02:40.000> hair<00:02:40.840> but<00:02:41.830> it's

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
was going to die this hair but it's

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.440 
was going to die this hair but it's
actually<00:02:42.220> a<00:02:42.580> very<00:02:42.760> very<00:02:43.660> dark<00:02:43.990> brown<00:02:44.410> so<00:02:44.890> if<00:02:45.450> it

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
actually a very very dark brown so if it

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.270 
actually a very very dark brown so if it
doesn't<00:02:46.810> look<00:02:46.870> bad<00:02:47.080> I<00:02:47.380> think<00:02:47.620> I<00:02:47.680> might<00:02:47.890> keep<00:02:48.100> it

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
doesn't look bad I think I might keep it

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.840 
doesn't look bad I think I might keep it
just<00:02:48.520> colored<00:02:49.120> it<00:02:50.130> just<00:02:51.130> looks<00:02:51.340> very<00:02:51.430> natural

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
just colored it just looks very natural

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.820
