00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.139
 bonasso and enrique solís de lealcan and today we are going to teach 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:10.949
 how to work so that the dog did not put the road 

00:00:10.949 --> 00:00:14.349
 this exercise can be divided into two parts one related to orders of 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:15.199
 control 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:18.199
 related to waiting orders that we spend to work now 

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:20.630
 so yes but slow down 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.429
 another related to the call 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:25.719
 and then point out the boundaries of the steps so that the dog understands 

00:00:25.719 --> 00:00:29.769
 walking cut and that does not live each client haystack different limits 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:32.220
 as for example the step 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.880
 The first thing we are going to do is as always using different types of 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:35.970
 reinforcers 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.420
 we are going to work with the clicker and with food 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.640
 then we can also stay with him 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.890
 and with the ball with the reinforced criterion of a games of biting and throwing 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.050
 today we use first to show you the waiting order 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.170
 the three types of reinforce 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.030
