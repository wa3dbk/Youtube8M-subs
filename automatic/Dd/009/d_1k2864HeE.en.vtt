00:00:04.749 --> 00:00:04.759 
so now I've got the Tucker hero this is

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:08.000 
so now I've got the Tucker hero this is
my<00:00:05.759> absolute<00:00:05.940> favorite<00:00:06.299> coffees<00:00:07.109> Yemen<00:00:07.589> mocha

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
my absolute favorite coffees Yemen mocha

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.000 
my absolute favorite coffees Yemen mocha
and<00:00:08.849> I've<00:00:09.540> probably<00:00:09.809> done<00:00:10.110> four<00:00:10.440> cups<00:00:10.740> now

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
and I've probably done four cups now

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.289 
and I've probably done four cups now
with<00:00:11.820> the<00:00:12.000> tak<00:00:12.240> and<00:00:12.889> I'm<00:00:13.889> beginning<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:14.790> get

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
with the tak and I'm beginning to get

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.180 
with the tak and I'm beginning to get
used<00:00:15.360> to<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.049> way<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.379> water<00:00:16.529> comes<00:00:16.890> out<00:00:17.130> of

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
used to the way the water comes out of

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.300 
used to the way the water comes out of
it<00:00:17.539> sit<00:00:18.539> when<00:00:18.660> I<00:00:18.690> pour<00:00:19.080> it<00:00:19.410> kind<00:00:19.650> of<00:00:19.680> goes<00:00:19.859> over

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
it sit when I pour it kind of goes over

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.730 
it sit when I pour it kind of goes over
there<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.240> left<00:00:21.270> it<00:00:21.840> doesn't<00:00:22.350> just<00:00:22.529> come

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
there to the left it doesn't just come

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.340 
there to the left it doesn't just come
straight<00:00:23.130> down<00:00:23.720> the<00:00:24.720> way<00:00:24.840> that<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.170> water

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
straight down the way that the water

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.429 
straight down the way that the water
does<00:00:25.619> with<00:00:25.949> my<00:00:26.160> Hari<00:00:26.460> Oh<00:00:26.580> kettle<00:00:27.480> with<00:00:28.320> the

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
does with my Hari Oh kettle with the

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:35.180 
does with my Hari Oh kettle with the
flow<00:00:28.619> restrictor<00:00:31.820> so<00:00:33.770> water<00:00:34.770> comes<00:00:34.950> out<00:00:35.160> a

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
flow restrictor so water comes out a

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.040 
flow restrictor so water comes out a
little<00:00:35.340> faster<00:00:35.610> so<00:00:36.149> I'm<00:00:36.300> kind<00:00:36.570> of<00:00:36.630> having<00:00:36.899> to

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
little faster so I'm kind of having to

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.400 
little faster so I'm kind of having to
stop<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.590> start<00:00:37.770> again<00:00:37.950> because<00:00:38.730> I<00:00:38.879> I<00:00:39.410> really

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
stop and start again because I I really

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.410 
stop and start again because I I really
keep<00:00:40.620> this<00:00:41.489> low<00:00:41.879> in<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.960> filter<00:00:43.770> cone<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:44.420> don't

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
keep this low in the filter cone I don't

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.760 
keep this low in the filter cone I don't
even<00:00:45.539> try<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.870> bring<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:46.230> up<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.590> halfway

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
even try to bring it up to the halfway

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.959 
even try to bring it up to the halfway
point<00:00:48.020> this<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.230> just<00:00:49.469> based<00:00:49.710> on<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.700> know<00:00:50.730> the

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
point this is just based on you know the

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.110 
point this is just based on you know the
way<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.449> like<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.989> coffee<00:00:52.199> to<00:00:52.440> taste<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:53.120> it

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
way I like the coffee to taste that it

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.510 
way I like the coffee to taste that it
seems<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.629> give<00:00:55.230> better<00:00:55.440> results<00:00:55.980> in<00:00:56.129> terms<00:00:56.160> of

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
seems to give better results in terms of

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.439 
seems to give better results in terms of
keeping<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.170> the<00:00:58.170> water<00:00:58.379> temperature<00:00:59.329> at<00:01:00.329> the

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
keeping the the water temperature at the

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.280 
keeping the the water temperature at the
right<00:01:00.660> place<00:01:02.149> if<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.300> put<00:01:03.539> too<00:01:03.750> much<00:01:03.899> water<00:01:04.110> in

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
right place if I put too much water in

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.109 
right place if I put too much water in
there<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:04.619> sometimes<00:01:05.280> worry<00:01:05.790> if<00:01:05.970> the

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
there I sometimes worry if the

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.929 
there I sometimes worry if the
temperature<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:06.570> dropping<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:07.260> don't<00:01:07.590> know

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 
temperature is dropping I don't know

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:10.219 
temperature is dropping I don't know
yeah<00:01:08.939> we<00:01:09.090> can<00:01:09.240> all<00:01:09.330> overthink<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:09.960> stuff

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
yeah we can all overthink this stuff

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:20.179 
yeah we can all overthink this stuff
right<00:01:14.450> so<00:01:16.400> I'm<00:01:17.400> also<00:01:17.640> watching<00:01:18.570> my<00:01:18.780> gauge<00:01:19.770> down

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
right so I'm also watching my gauge down

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.870 
right so I'm also watching my gauge down
here<00:01:20.580> on<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:20.970> six<00:01:21.799> I've<00:01:22.799> got<00:01:23.070> several<00:01:23.640> more

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
here on it six I've got several more

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:40.030 
here on it six I've got several more
ounces<00:01:24.390> to<00:01:24.630> go<00:01:26.270> shooting<00:01:27.270> for<00:01:27.479> my<00:01:27.570> usual<00:01:28.020> ten

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.100 

we<00:01:40.610> don't<00:01:40.760> worry<00:01:40.970> about<00:01:41.120> the<00:01:41.360> time<00:01:41.630> of<00:01:41.660> the

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
we don't worry about the time of the

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.290 
we don't worry about the time of the
poor<00:01:42.320> chicken<00:01:43.160> right<00:01:43.340> get<00:01:43.820> it<00:01:43.940> through<00:01:44.150> there

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
poor chicken right get it through there

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.910 
poor chicken right get it through there
pretty<00:01:44.570> much<00:01:44.750> as<00:01:44.900> fast<00:01:45.110> as<00:01:45.380> it's<00:01:45.590> gonna<00:01:45.710> go

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
pretty much as fast as it's gonna go

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.450 
pretty much as fast as it's gonna go
this<00:01:46.160> way<00:01:46.220> and<00:01:47.230> when<00:01:48.230> my<00:01:48.380> 10<00:01:48.620> ounces<00:01:49.010> is<00:01:49.220> gone

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
this way and when my 10 ounces is gone

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.210 
this way and when my 10 ounces is gone
or<00:01:49.910> 10<00:01:50.600> ounces<00:01:50.900> 60<00:01:51.200> now<00:01:51.260> when<00:01:51.440> I<00:01:51.470> get<00:01:51.590> to<00:01:51.800> the<00:01:52.070> 10

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
or 10 ounces 60 now when I get to the 10

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.840 
or 10 ounces 60 now when I get to the 10
ounce<00:01:52.340> point<00:01:52.700> I<00:01:52.850> just<00:01:53.030> stopped<00:01:53.440> so<00:01:54.700> only<00:01:55.700> when

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
ounce point I just stopped so only when

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.310 
ounce point I just stopped so only when
I'm<00:01:55.970> done<00:01:56.150> with<00:01:56.360> this<00:01:56.480> video<00:01:56.810> will<00:01:57.050> I<00:01:57.140> actually

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
I'm done with this video will I actually

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.230 
I'm done with this video will I actually
know<00:01:57.590> exactly<00:01:57.980> how<00:01:58.160> long<00:01:58.400> it<00:01:58.640> usually<00:01:58.790> takes

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
know exactly how long it usually takes

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.300 
know exactly how long it usually takes
to<00:01:59.680> do<00:02:00.680> one<00:02:00.860> of<00:02:00.890> these<00:02:01.070> pores<00:02:02.000> I<00:02:03.010> used<00:02:04.010> to<00:02:04.100> worry

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
to do one of these pores I used to worry

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.890 
to do one of these pores I used to worry
about<00:02:04.430> that<00:02:04.760> stuff<00:02:04.880> a<00:02:05.090> lot<00:02:05.240> more<00:02:05.480> when<00:02:05.660> I<00:02:05.690> had<00:02:05.870> a

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
about that stuff a lot more when I had a

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.160 
about that stuff a lot more when I had a
chem<00:02:06.140> X<00:02:06.380> and<00:02:06.740> I<00:02:06.980> could<00:02:07.790> never<00:02:08.090> get<00:02:08.480> the<00:02:08.840> Chemex

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
chem X and I could never get the Chemex

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.870 
chem X and I could never get the Chemex
stuff<00:02:09.500> to<00:02:09.680> go<00:02:09.800> fast<00:02:10.100> enough<00:02:10.490> for<00:02:10.700> my

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
stuff to go fast enough for my

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.200 
stuff to go fast enough for my
satisfaction<00:02:12.100> all<00:02:13.100> right<00:02:13.220> that's<00:02:13.700> it

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
satisfaction all right that's it

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.530 
satisfaction all right that's it
I<00:02:14.240> made<00:02:14.570> it<00:02:14.720> to<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:14.960> 10<00:02:15.140> ounces
