00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
 yes 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.170
 hello apple droid friends welcome 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:22.130
 to the complete analysis of the band 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:24.680
 sports vido this is the second 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:28.490
 generation that we have available from 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:32.360
 this device and that within your 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:35.030
 main differences is in a new 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.520
 proper design and a new type 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:40.460
 of charger if they realize in the part 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.460
 below it has two in this case the slot 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.399
 to connect magnetically to the charger 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.760
 which makes it much easier 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:52.370
 Loading process of this device 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.409
 this one has an oled screen that does not 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.719
 pay a series of information such 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:59.210
 such as the number of steps 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:01.359
 that we have also given the calories that 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.489
 we have spent and also the distance 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:08.270
 but one of the main differences 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:11.240
 is that he will also be able to show 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.970
 the notifications here we can see the 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.420
 application in this case that we have for 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.420
 part of the million 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.070
 will determine us for example the 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.900
 distance that we have traveled the 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.200
 calories that we have spent and all that 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.600
 type of important information 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.909
 this is the application we have for 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.700
 use the device and it gives us 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.460
 information such as the battery 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.770
 remaining the calorie distance 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.860
 etcetera that we have burned and if we 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.799
 let's go to the additional options today 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.979
 to my bracelet and I go for example to the 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.659
 other sevenths good and here as they can 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.630
 see are all the different 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.780
 options is for example the 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.420
 option of notifications and already here 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.819
 we can see all notifications and 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.259
 pressing add there we will see by 

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:03.780
 example all the different 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.259
 applications that we have and which are 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.360
 which, for example, we want 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:13.230
 notifications appear at the time of 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.880
 be using the device wants 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.100
 say that every time we see a 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.709
 new notification of course goes to 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.910
 appear on the bracelet we can not 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:24.660
 to interact 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.540
 For example, change or respond 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:30.210
 notifications directly from here 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:33.060
 but if we are going to have an option that 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:36.000
 are available if we want 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:39.060
 use to then take out the phone and 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.760
 obviously see them from this 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.910
 positive so that's pretty useful that 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.220
 option and as for the duration of 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.870
 battery of this device the truth is 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.940
 that has lasted much more than one 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.370
 week the truth is that if there is one of 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.930
 the points that calls much much the 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.630
 attention on this device your 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.819
 huge battery life what 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.810
 requires last week and if they are given 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.580
 account 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:09.890
 I'm going to try to get a little closer 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:13.310
 I have about 50% of duration of 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:16.340
 battery in this case with nice next 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:19.650
 pretty good in that section is a 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.950
 band the truth that at the time of 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:26.310
 It feels very comfortable like it was not 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:29.370
 using it there is and how can you see 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:32.489
 the truth feels very good and is 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:34.920
 quite comfortable to be able to use is a 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.720
 band the truth quite economic and it's 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.709
 that's why he does not want things like 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:43.349
 example a hard rain's reader and that 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.980
 kind of things because obviously inside 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:48.170
 of the range of pressure that moves 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.340
 not available to its action 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:55.470
 but if you are looking for a bracelet to 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:59.700
 power in this case carry 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:02.220
 an analysis of its performance in this 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.650
 case to run and that kind of thing and 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.170
 have some notifications available 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.030
 and then do not pay defraud duration of 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.640
 battery a week so you go the truth 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.430
 highly recommended so I hope that you 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:18.590
 have liked this little analysis of the 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.590
 band of 'don x
