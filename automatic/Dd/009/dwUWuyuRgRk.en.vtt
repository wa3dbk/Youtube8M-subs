00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.269
 little 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.630
 today we had to meet for 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:18.220
 a pathfinder month test but this 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.720
 video is going to be short since 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.240
 Unfortunately, the knife broke 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.740
 enough this is concretely this knife 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.939
 it's the big thing from humor to mouth 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.340
 kraft blacks we already saw together 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:29.230
 who is here this is what goes especially the 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.210
 differentiate it's the length of 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.210
 man since we are sure in cm on the 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.940
 dead to mouth black kraft and 17 cm on 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.240
 the pathfinder then this difference of 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.040
 blade 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.050
 obviously it will play on everything that 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.180
 is shopping so shopping is where 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.640
 where we come to slap with the knife a 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.530
 little bit like a machete and also 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.820
 over the length of the sections that the 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.190
 diameter of sections that we will be able 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.960
 sticks with at reading level on 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.380
 is on a Scandinavian-type measurement 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:59.260
 on the other hand all packed grind is done 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:03.370
 very slight little angle here so everything to 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.869
 left of the cutting edge so this little angle 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.850
 in my opinion is really voluntary from the 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:08.320
 part of me what will surely him 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.300
 allow to have a little more 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.590
 impact resistance 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.480
 here I am going to try to come and type here 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.520
 a little bit like a machete for 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.570
 fall this little branch of diameter 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.570
 already substantial 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.630
 that's the work on this type of section 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.159
 is really easy while 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.380
 comfort since the sleeve remains 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.000
 nice so we can take it here or 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.740
 so take it down two sleeves by 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.909
 against again my rap do not have 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.140
 planned small strokes for the strap 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.119
 which is really a shame for this guy 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.289
 of tool since it would be nice to 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.810
 see the hand strap allows handle to 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:00.450
 saint-servan at the end of the sleeve 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.759
 So here is the slaughter of 7 this little 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.829
 tree did not move quickly by 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.079
 against there are some small problems 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.000
 at the cutting edge so the cutting edge 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:12.870
 who was a little bit twisted with 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.959
 a little chic if so so maybe 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.840
 not if she called it to the work of 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.640
 machete at the level of the baton I'm going 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.090
 start by boat the one piece of 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.700
 so be well know well hard of a 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.000
 good length for a little bit what 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.000
 it gives 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.680
 the knife broke net 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.569
 this is still a great 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.209
 disillusionment for me who trusted 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:58.800
 still in the pond as will have so 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.110
 there we really see that it broke net 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.580
 so 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:07.820
 a hit of a stick hall 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.170
 really disappointed on this one well here 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.910
 in the end I'm really 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:15.080
 disappointed because I still wanted a 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:16.760
 trust in the mora brand is here 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.740
 knowing that the boat the age I have 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.090
 does it's essential that the beginning 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.620
 I had planned a little bigger 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.350
 to see if the length of the mpt 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.520
 was really worth it at the 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.190
 function a little machete that one 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:31.700
 could say well there has already been 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.080
 some small chips on the blade a 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.310
 little bit disappointed anyway here I have the 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.720
 say 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.420
 knowing that at the level of the length at 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.850
 my opinion is not that the ratio 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.739
 soul length and so who who 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.020
 crosses in the match is not suitable 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:47.150
 in fact the silk must be too thin 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.190
 since logically it is the same as 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.540
 on the black kraft mouth mucha which is 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.190
 here a much shorter blade so 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.690
 the lever arm or when comes 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.590
 tap on the tip this will put a 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.270
 little bit less force inside 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.900
 so could a knife that had some 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:01.280
 potential that I used 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.050
 just that all week and 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.790
 ben I was regaled with me for 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.740
 to be frank I really thought that his 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.740
 letter 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.960
 a good knife and there a great big 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.370
 big disappointment 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:14.320
 here is a knife of this size 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:16.420
 if we can not do a lot of work 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.520
 with it's still a little bit 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.200
 incoherent what is it like to have a 

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.910
 long blade if we can not sticks 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.670
 the big sections 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:27.350
 it's a bit useless otherwise this put 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:29.510
 apart from that I had found that 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.560
 the length of the soul did not bother that 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.000
 the knife was still nice 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.790
 for small tasks also 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.860
 since it weighs only 167 g 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.000
 so that's only 45 grams more than the 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.770
 word to mouth kraft blacks 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.690
 so I found that very precisely 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:42.860
 interesting to have a knife that 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.840
 allow to work as a 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.580
 knife so little girls doer 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.250
 stick et cetera and so on 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.870
 very nice while being able 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.420
 possibly additionally act as a 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.500
 little bit of machete or come again 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.080
 big logs like we could 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.010
 do with a knife two camps so 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.470
 I was really in quotation marks 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.580
 big hopes in this knife that's who 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.490
 have been negated 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:06.440
 with this boat swims here hoping 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.570
 that this video you and more and then 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.870
 you avoid an unhappy purchase thanks to 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:10.870
 soon
