 an independent entrepreneur's car 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:59.179

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:02.959
 yes you know on the other hand 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.939
 11,000 euros you just have one thing that 

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:06.740
 probably advances for years 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:08.119
 with your hunger about such an outlander 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.860
 little to tell 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.880
 no sir it's still quite a character 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.410
 bake why well subaru we 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.890
 boxer engine Serbian wants it that way 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.989
 special 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.060
 the permanent four-wheel drive 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:21.200
 such a special this is really a brand 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.350
 with an appearance and their own 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.030
 I have my identity and 158 horsepower 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.980
 let them tell 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.400
 so then immediately something more than the 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.609
 yours 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.660
 jan de dan the mitsubishi forrester 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:34.639
 outlander 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.739
 You could say exactly that 

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:38.510
 own for years to go 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.980
 drive with this body yes both the 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.209
 mitsubishi if we find subaru 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.000
 actually assume it isn't 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:46.370
 just go wrong but which of these 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.530
 you buy two with your head well me 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.829
 would say you do the extra dees 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.160
 Do you have a serious daddy plan? 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:54.350
 goes here 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.790
 I am already planning mix blocking sea 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.310
 but mike u on bello 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.470
 yes yes let's get a good one first 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.600
 excludes peter than yes for some old ones 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.709
 yes what is the wise one 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.359
 without a doubt why 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:07.420
 two- wheel drive four - wheel drive 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:10.730
 it has a higher kilometer cost price 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.720
 This is the most you can here it too 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.110
 bring the fastest children to school 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.620
 yes good question arrive i see what the 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.620
 starting line 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.150
 three 2p 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:25.270
 a beautiful hard time there began 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:27.669
 doing well 2 yes yes but even more horsepower 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.720
 can well that is a known about van 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:30.009
 is building and you know all that 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.449
 four-wheel drive ensures 

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:35.139
 presumably the drive is already there 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:36.280
 you have 158 hp and the box this too 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:38.349
 pretty rough 

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.090
 yes you can say yes but what 

00:04:38.349 --> 00:04:41.560
 benefit of a subaru 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:43.750
 I of course have four-wheel drive 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.979
 so if it would have snowed 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.990
 or how should a mountain on one be 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:48.400
 I had just driven that we were today 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.650
 not wrong hey take it with you 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:54.970
 out with it makes me feel good 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:57.729
 w about want with you because i have like 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.620
 usually not the fastest car either 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:02.740
 like just i have the most economic 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.180
 today's choice but if you are with you 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.460
 heart should choose which of these 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.800
 take two then yes I secretly find the 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.240
 Subaru is really the coolest he looks 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.690
 just cool out 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.220

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:17.080

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.979
