00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.410 

I<00:01:04.530> think<00:01:05.190> the<00:01:05.340> fact<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:05.700> this<00:01:05.970> looked<00:01:06.240> like

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
I think the fact that this looked like

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.090 
I think the fact that this looked like
just<00:01:06.570> any<00:01:06.810> other<00:01:06.900> airplane<00:01:07.350> taking<00:01:07.590> off<00:01:07.830> is

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
just any other airplane taking off is

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:17.660 
just any other airplane taking off is
actually<00:01:08.550> a<00:01:08.580> really<00:01:08.850> wonderful<00:01:08.970> thing<00:01:16.670> in

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
actually a really wonderful thing in

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.940 
actually a really wonderful thing in
both<00:01:17.880> car<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.450> plane<00:01:18.750> mode<00:01:19.050> the<00:01:19.500> vehicle<00:01:19.860> is

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
both car and plane mode the vehicle is

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.010 
both car and plane mode the vehicle is

for pricier aviation fuel this will help

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.030 
for pricier aviation fuel this will help
