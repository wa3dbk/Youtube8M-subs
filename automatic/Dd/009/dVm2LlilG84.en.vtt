 Working child and today I got into it light. 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.970
 I entered 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.210

 out-of-field environment too 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.950
 very good coming from the stands 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.320
 We expect the same thing there in 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.049

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.799
 I think the objective was fulfilled. 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.900
 goal of passing first and 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.520
 contradictory was wonderful and the selection 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.810
 only to be congratulated us dedicated to our 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.409
 supporters who have been supporting us 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.049
 and has the most passionate fans of the 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.960
 world is Brazilian and when you see 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.340
 it has no way to rip the suddenly 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.070
 alliance of the game we already comes with 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.659
 only goal is to run to win the 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.369
 play and dedicate to them the victory because 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.060
 they deserve our goal was this 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.060
 huh 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:06.300
 only sort independently whether 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.280
 with a win and a draw 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.160
 it is our thought to classify then 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.570
 now it's rest and rest because 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.240
 in a little while you have a hard game too 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.380
 do not know yet who we will face but 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.600
 It's definitely going to be a very fun game. 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:22.890
 It's difficult that it's a team 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.600
 affirms that he is very fond of the 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.510
 our game also seeks to do in 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.760
 selection and the other is a good 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.990
 known to us that Uruguay is a 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.240
 team that we were already 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.160
 accompanying since the Copa America is a 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.770
 team that has a lot of quality is 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.540
 going through a special moment and going 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.780
 be a semifinal game now it's all 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.710
 zeroed and who misses less with certainty 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.710
 to move to the final
