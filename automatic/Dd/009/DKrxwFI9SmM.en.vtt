00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.020 
is one of these maps that I've kind of
grown<00:00:13.440> a<00:00:13.559> little<00:00:13.769> bit<00:00:13.920> of<00:00:14.099> love<00:00:14.280> for<00:00:14.549> you<00:00:14.940> know

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
I really did struggle with this map in

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.470 
I really did struggle with this map in
the<00:00:16.619> beginning<00:00:16.920> because<00:00:17.340> it's<00:00:17.850> hard<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.240> hold

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
the beginning because it's hard to hold

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.970 
the beginning because it's hard to hold
down<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.750> position<00:00:18.930> because<00:00:19.680> there's<00:00:19.830> so

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
down the position because there's so

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.590 
down the position because there's so
many<00:00:20.070> flank<00:00:20.400> routes<00:00:20.609> but<00:00:21.240> once<00:00:21.420> you<00:00:21.480> start

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
many flank routes but once you start

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.300 
many flank routes but once you start
understanding<00:00:21.810> spawns<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:22.800> all<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.100> traffic

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
understanding spawns and all the traffic

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.340 
understanding spawns and all the traffic
patterns<00:00:23.820> it<00:00:24.359> can<00:00:24.570> get<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.720> little<00:00:25.080> bit<00:00:25.199> easier

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
patterns it can get a little bit easier

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.050 
patterns it can get a little bit easier

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.770 
mid-range engagements every now and then
and<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.590> like<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.890> use<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.340> mp5<00:01:38.939> on<00:01:39.240> maps<00:01:39.509> that

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
and I like to use the mp5 on maps that

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.840 
and I like to use the mp5 on maps that
require<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.500> lot<00:01:40.799> of<00:01:40.829> close<00:01:41.280> quarter<00:01:41.820> combat

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
might be the best map to use the mp5 I

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.520 
might be the best map to use the mp5 I
might<00:01:48.270> be<00:01:48.420> forgetting<00:01:48.960> some<00:01:49.140> maps<00:01:49.320> off<00:01:49.470> the

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:51.570 
tier in dead silence in the third tier I
find<00:03:49.540> personally<00:03:50.470> that<00:03:50.680> dead<00:03:50.980> silence<00:03:51.430> is

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:51.580 
find personally that dead silence is

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.850 
find personally that dead silence is
essential<00:03:52.360> for<00:03:52.390> running<00:03:52.810> around<00:03:52.900> you<00:03:53.709> know<00:03:53.830> I

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
essential for running around you know I

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:55.650 
essential for running around you know I
do<00:03:54.040> like<00:03:54.340> to<00:03:54.459> use<00:03:54.489> steady<00:03:54.910> aim<00:03:55.120> don't<00:03:55.450> get<00:03:55.570> me

do like to use steady aim don't get me

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.330 
do like to use steady aim don't get me
wrong<00:03:55.690> steady<00:03:56.080> aim<00:03:56.260> would<00:03:56.470> be<00:03:56.530> the<00:03:56.769> optimal

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
wrong steady aim would be the optimal

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.330 
wrong steady aim would be the optimal
you<00:03:57.970> know<00:03:58.120> if<00:03:58.269> in<00:03:59.019> a<00:03:59.170> perfect<00:03:59.530> world<00:03:59.680> if<00:04:00.130> you

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
you know if in a perfect world if you

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.310 
you know if in a perfect world if you
could<00:04:00.820> put<00:04:01.000> steady<00:04:01.269> aim<00:04:01.450> on<00:04:01.630> an<00:04:01.900> quick-draw

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
could put steady aim on an quick-draw

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.930 
could put steady aim on an quick-draw
that'd<00:04:02.769> be<00:04:03.010> great<00:04:03.250> but<00:04:03.430> the<00:04:03.550> fact<00:04:03.580> of<00:04:03.850> the

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
that'd be great but the fact of the

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.370 
that'd be great but the fact of the
matter<00:04:04.000> is<00:04:04.239> it's<00:04:04.660> not<00:04:04.810> a<00:04:04.840> perfect<00:04:05.290> world

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
matter is it's not a perfect world

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.100 
matter is it's not a perfect world
people<00:04:05.769> call<00:04:06.070> in<00:04:06.220> UAVs<00:04:06.700> religiously<00:04:07.450> so<00:04:08.019> you

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
people call in UAVs religiously so you

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.860 
people call in UAVs religiously so you
have<00:04:08.590> to<00:04:08.860> use<00:04:09.239> assassin<00:04:10.239> in<00:04:10.390> this<00:04:10.510> game<00:04:10.690> if<00:04:10.840> you

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
have to use assassin in this game if you

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.259 
have to use assassin in this game if you
plan<00:04:11.170> on<00:04:11.290> moving<00:04:11.440> at<00:04:11.739> all<00:04:11.890> and<00:04:12.190> I<00:04:12.820> look<00:04:13.030> at<00:04:13.120> this

that<00:04:17.590> using<00:04:17.739> assassin<00:04:18.310> is<00:04:18.400> essential<00:04:19.049> and

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
that just means it's gonna be easier for

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.640 
that just means it's gonna be easier for
me<00:04:40.450> to<00:04:40.480> kill<00:04:40.720> you<00:04:40.870> but<00:04:41.080> they<00:04:41.200> do<00:04:41.260> get<00:04:41.500> their

cheap kills every now and now and then
which<00:04:43.960> is<00:04:44.080> why<00:04:44.230> it's<00:04:44.440> frustrating<00:04:45.010> but<00:04:45.880> I<00:04:46.060> find

from the enemy team and I find it it's

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.300 
from the enemy team and I find it it's
actually<00:05:43.380> really<00:05:44.380> helped<00:05:44.620> my<00:05:44.710> game<00:05:44.919> out<00:05:45.130> as

actually really helped my game out as
far<00:05:45.520> as<00:05:45.640> Russian<00:05:46.030> goes<00:05:46.210> I'm<00:05:46.840> trying<00:05:47.110> to<00:05:47.289> stay

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:47.890 
far as Russian goes I'm trying to stay

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:49.650 
far as Russian goes I'm trying to stay
away<00:05:48.130> from<00:05:48.190> the<00:05:48.580> camping<00:05:49.240> a<00:05:49.300> little<00:05:49.510> bit

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:49.660 
away from the camping a little bit

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.350 
away from the camping a little bit
because<00:05:49.810> in<00:05:50.350> this<00:05:50.800> game<00:05:51.039> I<00:05:51.400> find<00:05:51.820> it<00:05:51.940> does<00:05:52.090> take

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360 
because in this game I find it does take

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.510 
because in this game I find it does take
a<00:05:52.390> little<00:05:52.630> bit<00:05:52.750> more<00:05:52.870> you<00:05:53.440> know<00:05:53.560> fast<00:05:53.890> reaction

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520 
a little bit more you know fast reaction

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.110 
a little bit more you know fast reaction
times<00:05:55.289> than<00:05:56.289> black<00:05:56.500> ops<00:05:56.740> because<00:05:57.669> of<00:05:57.850> the<00:05:57.910> fact

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:58.120 
times than black ops because of the fact

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.510 
times than black ops because of the fact
that<00:05:58.180> you<00:05:58.360> die<00:05:58.600> so<00:05:58.990> fast<00:05:59.020> so<00:05:59.590> I'm<00:05:59.860> figuring<00:06:00.370> out

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 
that you die so fast so I'm figuring out

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.730 
that you die so fast so I'm figuring out
that<00:06:00.639> I<00:06:00.700> can<00:06:00.970> actually<00:06:01.120> abuse<00:06:01.720> this<00:06:01.900> and<00:06:02.139> I<00:06:02.590> can

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740 
that I can actually abuse this and I can

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.350 
that I can actually abuse this and I can
take<00:06:02.889> advantage<00:06:03.340> because<00:06:03.760> a<00:06:03.789> lot<00:06:04.060> of<00:06:04.090> people

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:04.360 
take advantage because a lot of people

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.180 
take advantage because a lot of people
don't<00:06:04.510> have<00:06:04.660> the<00:06:05.169> reaction<00:06:05.620> time<00:06:05.800> to<00:06:06.039> be

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.190 
don't have the reaction time to be

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:08.940 
don't have the reaction time to be
extremely<00:06:06.760> successful<00:06:06.910> as<00:06:07.600> rushing<00:06:08.110> and<00:06:08.289> you

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:08.950 
extremely successful as rushing and you

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:10.469 
extremely successful as rushing and you
know<00:06:09.070> when<00:06:09.250> you<00:06:09.340> pop<00:06:09.520> up<00:06:09.700> in<00:06:09.820> the<00:06:09.910> face<00:06:10.120> can

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:10.479 
know when you pop up in the face can

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:12.810 
know when you pop up in the face can
they<00:06:10.690> can't<00:06:10.960> always<00:06:11.250> take<00:06:12.250> you<00:06:12.460> out<00:06:12.610> in<00:06:12.729> a

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:12.820 
they can't always take you out in a

split second so I try to you know work

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:19.620 
split second so I try to you know work
the<00:06:16.780> maps<00:06:17.020> in<00:06:17.200> a<00:06:17.260> way<00:06:17.410> and<00:06:17.770> use<00:06:18.160> those<00:06:19.090> extra
