I love this palette I really like it

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.189 
I love this palette I really like it
because<00:00:14.639> it's<00:00:14.910> mostly<00:00:15.059> warm<00:00:15.540> but<00:00:15.690> it<00:00:15.750> does<00:00:15.900> mix

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
because it's mostly warm but it does mix

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.900 
because it's mostly warm but it does mix
in<00:00:16.350> a<00:00:16.410> few<00:00:16.650> cooler<00:00:17.039> tones<00:00:17.310> so<00:00:17.550> it<00:00:17.640> gives<00:00:17.730> a

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
in a few cooler tones so it gives a

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.359 
in a few cooler tones so it gives a
really<00:00:17.940> good<00:00:18.270> range<00:00:18.570> of<00:00:18.930> color<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.439> it<00:00:20.160> also

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
really good range of color and it also

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.880 
really good range of color and it also
has<00:00:20.550> more<00:00:21.449> mass<00:00:21.689> than<00:00:21.720> it<00:00:22.020> does<00:00:22.170> have<00:00:22.470> shimmers

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
has more mass than it does have shimmers

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.500 
has more mass than it does have shimmers
which<00:00:23.100> is<00:00:23.250> pretty<00:00:23.400> hard<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.699> find<00:00:23.910> in<00:00:24.119> Pallet

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510
