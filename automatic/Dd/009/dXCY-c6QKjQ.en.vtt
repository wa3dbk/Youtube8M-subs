00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
know for so long I think they've been

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:47.300 
know for so long I think they've been
stuck<00:03:45.269> a<00:03:45.299> little<00:03:45.599> bit<00:03:45.720> in<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:45.930> 50s<00:03:46.379> in<00:03:47.069> terms

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
stuck a little bit in the 50s in terms

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.280 
stuck a little bit in the 50s in terms

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
of their viewpoints so that was really

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.189 
of their viewpoints so that was really
nice<00:03:49.470> to<00:03:49.680> see<00:03:49.829> in<00:03:49.949> the<00:03:50.040> audience<00:03:50.540> again<00:03:51.540> was

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:52.199

talent to really make a mark and Kevin

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:51.110 
talent to really make a mark and Kevin
Hart<00:04:49.919> of<00:04:50.010> course<00:04:50.219> is<00:04:50.370> front<00:04:50.610> and<00:04:50.639> center<00:04:51.029> and

00:04:53.149 --> 00:04:53.159 
it's a good thing he's so small because

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:54.140 
it's a good thing he's so small because
a<00:04:53.219> little<00:04:53.520> of<00:04:53.610> Kevin

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
a little of Kevin

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.270 
a little of Kevin
goes<00:04:54.330> a<00:04:54.360> long<00:04:54.630> way<00:04:54.930> and<00:04:55.229> I<00:04:55.560> think<00:04:55.740> he<00:04:55.830> Joe<00:04:56.040> he

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
goes a long way and I think he Joe he

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.400 
goes a long way and I think he Joe he
comes<00:04:56.490> just<00:04:56.850> up<00:04:57.000> to<00:04:57.150> the<00:04:57.180> edge<00:04:57.389> here<00:04:57.419> of<00:04:57.960> being

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
comes just up to the edge here of being

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:00.830 
comes just up to the edge here of being
grading<00:04:59.220> of<00:04:59.340> being<00:04:59.639> overexposed<00:05:00.389> and<00:05:00.540> I<00:05:00.630> think

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
grading of being overexposed and I think

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:01.790 
grading of being overexposed and I think
that's<00:05:00.960> something<00:05:01.139> he's<00:05:01.320> going<00:05:01.470> to<00:05:01.620> have<00:05:01.710> to

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
that's something he's going to have to

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.500 
that's something he's going to have to
watch<00:05:01.949> out<00:05:02.190> for<00:05:02.370> as<00:05:02.610> he<00:05:02.910> makes<00:05:03.090> more<00:05:03.300> and<00:05:03.360> more

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
watch out for as he makes more and more

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:05.120 
watch out for as he makes more and more
movies<00:05:04.020> I<00:05:04.050> mean<00:05:04.320> this<00:05:04.380> is<00:05:04.560> his<00:05:04.680> third<00:05:04.860> film

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660

this year already and I think he's gonna
have<00:05:06.750> to<00:05:06.900> be<00:05:06.990> a<00:05:07.020> little<00:05:07.169> careful<00:05:07.440> especially

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 
have to be a little careful especially

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.550 
have to be a little careful especially
because<00:05:08.190> his<00:05:08.460> routine<00:05:08.850> is<00:05:09.060> to<00:05:09.330> be<00:05:09.630> manic<00:05:10.020> but

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
because his routine is to be manic but

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
as I said he comes just up to the edge

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.330 
as I said he comes just up to the edge
here<00:05:12.389> he<00:05:12.690> doesn't<00:05:12.870> cross<00:05:13.169> the<00:05:13.199> line<00:05:13.470> and<00:05:13.889> he
