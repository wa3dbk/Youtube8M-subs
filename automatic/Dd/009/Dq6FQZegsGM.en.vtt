00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
I believe which I don't know if it's

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.240 
I believe which I don't know if it's
going<00:04:00.590> to<00:04:00.650> work<00:04:01.690> i'm<00:04:02.690> studing<00:04:03.320> can<00:04:03.650> skate

going to work i'm studing can skate
tank<00:04:04.520> every<00:04:04.850> week<00:04:05.230> be<00:04:06.230> pumped<00:04:06.590> for<00:04:06.770> the<00:04:06.980> filter

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.730 

the<00:04:10.670> air<00:04:11.000> pump<00:04:11.630> which<00:04:11.900> I'm<00:04:12.050> so<00:04:12.230> excited<00:04:12.260> about

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:12.740 
the air pump which I'm so excited about

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.660 
the air pump which I'm so excited about
because<00:04:13.280> I<00:04:13.310> can<00:04:13.580> make<00:04:13.730> a<00:04:13.790> filter<00:04:14.240> out<00:04:14.390> of<00:04:14.510> this

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
because I can make a filter out of this

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.640 
because I can make a filter out of this
the<00:04:16.670> tubing<00:04:17.450> for<00:04:17.780> the<00:04:17.840> air<00:04:17.959> pump<00:04:18.170> I<00:04:18.320> don't<00:04:18.530> know

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
the tubing for the air pump I don't know

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:19.780 
the tubing for the air pump I don't know
what<00:04:18.769> this<00:04:18.920> is<00:04:18.980> called<00:04:19.250> I<00:04:19.400> think<00:04:19.459> it's<00:04:19.700> just

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
what this is called I think it's just

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.310 
what this is called I think it's just
tubing<00:04:20.299> and<00:04:21.010> these<00:04:22.010> seven<00:04:22.400> watt<00:04:23.020> light<00:04:24.020> bulb

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
tubing and these seven watt light bulb

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.930 
tubing and these seven watt light bulb
which<00:04:24.620> you<00:04:24.770> can<00:04:24.950> switch<00:04:25.160> out<00:04:25.370> if<00:04:25.580> you<00:04:25.700> want<00:04:25.880> to

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:25.940 
which you can switch out if you want to

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.360 
which you can switch out if you want to
buy<00:04:26.060> another<00:04:26.270> one<00:04:26.510> so<00:04:27.110> yeah<00:04:27.380> and<00:04:27.590> what<00:04:28.280> I<00:04:28.310> just

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
buy another one so yeah and what I just

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:29.920 
buy another one so yeah and what I just
realized<00:04:28.670> is<00:04:28.970> this<00:04:29.090> tank<00:04:29.300> as<00:04:29.390> a<00:04:29.420> feeding<00:04:29.780> hole

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:29.930 
realized is this tank as a feeding hole

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.260 
realized is this tank as a feeding hole
which<00:04:30.080> is<00:04:30.200> so<00:04:30.350> cool<00:04:30.560> okay<00:04:31.400> I<00:04:31.580> really<00:04:31.970> have<00:04:32.090> to

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
which is so cool okay I really have to

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.340 
which is so cool okay I really have to
set<00:04:32.420> this<00:04:32.570> up<00:04:33.640> okay<00:04:34.640> whatever<00:04:35.030> this<00:04:35.180> is<00:04:35.390> I<00:04:35.870> did

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:36.350 
set this up okay whatever this is I did

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.890 
set this up okay whatever this is I did
decide<00:04:37.040> I<00:04:37.490> think<00:04:37.790> it's<00:04:38.060> the<00:04:38.210> bubbler<00:04:38.600> thingy

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
decide I think it's the bubbler thingy

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.780 
decide I think it's the bubbler thingy
for<00:04:39.140> the<00:04:39.260> air<00:04:39.350> pump<00:04:39.560> but<00:04:39.860> yeah<00:04:40.010> I<00:04:40.310> just<00:04:40.520> found

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
for the air pump but yeah I just found

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.580 
for the air pump but yeah I just found
that<00:04:40.940> that's<00:04:41.300> pretty<00:04:41.540> cool<00:04:41.720> there's<00:04:42.110> closel

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
so here's what the final tank looks like

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.160

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
like one gallon but it took way more

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.090 
like one gallon but it took way more
than<00:04:56.300> one<00:04:56.510> gallon<00:04:56.960> for<00:04:57.200> me<00:04:57.380> at<00:04:57.470> least<00:04:57.650> if<00:04:57.980> you

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
than one gallon for me at least if you

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.070 
than one gallon for me at least if you
have<00:04:58.190> the<00:04:58.280> same<00:04:58.460> attack<00:04:58.760> tank<00:04:59.360> just<00:04:59.750> comment

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
have the same attack tank just comment

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.960 
have the same attack tank just comment
down<00:05:00.140> below<00:05:00.350> but<00:05:01.220> I<00:05:01.400> don't<00:05:01.550> know<00:05:01.610> it<00:05:01.760> took<00:05:01.880> a

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970

down below but I don't know it took a
lot<00:05:02.180> more<00:05:02.480> than<00:05:02.780> a<00:05:02.810> gallon<00:05:03.260> I<00:05:03.290> think<00:05:03.710> it<00:05:04.010> has

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
lot more than a gallon I think it has

lot more than a gallon I think it has
this<00:05:05.060> little<00:05:05.210> feeder<00:05:05.600> hole<00:05:05.900> right<00:05:06.080> here<00:05:06.140> I

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
this little feeder hole right here I

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:11.010 
this little feeder hole right here I
will<00:05:06.740> show<00:05:06.770> you<00:05:07.190> where's<00:05:07.970> my<00:05:08.150> camera

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.529 

there<00:05:12.020> it<00:05:12.169> is<00:05:12.319> and<00:05:12.559> it<00:05:13.279> actually<00:05:13.430> has<00:05:13.909> like<00:05:14.479> a

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:14.539 
there it is and it actually has like a

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:17.980 
there it is and it actually has like a
piece<00:05:14.779> of<00:05:14.809> plastic<00:05:15.460> above<00:05:16.460> the<00:05:16.669> light<00:05:16.939> in<00:05:17.150> so

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:17.990 
piece of plastic above the light in so

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:22.450 
piece of plastic above the light in so
it's<00:05:18.919> pretty<00:05:19.279> safe<00:05:19.520> and<00:05:20.139> okay<00:05:21.139> I<00:05:21.499> have<00:05:22.099> the

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
it's pretty safe and okay I have the

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.159 
it's pretty safe and okay I have the
filter<00:05:22.939> it's<00:05:23.120> under<00:05:23.360> gravel<00:05:23.749> I<00:05:23.900> don't<00:05:24.080> know

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:24.169 
filter it's under gravel I don't know

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:27.040 
filter it's under gravel I don't know
how<00:05:25.039> that's<00:05:25.159> gonna<00:05:25.339> work<00:05:25.699> you<00:05:25.969> know<00:05:25.999> because<00:05:26.900> a

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 
how that's gonna work you know because a

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.390 
how that's gonna work you know because a
lot<00:05:27.259> of<00:05:27.379> people<00:05:27.589> say<00:05:27.680> the<00:05:27.889> underground<00:05:28.309> my

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
lot of people say the underground my

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.679 
lot of people say the underground my
filters<00:05:28.789> don't<00:05:28.999> work<00:05:30.339> so<00:05:31.339> there<00:05:32.029> is<00:05:32.330> just<00:05:32.479> the

00:05:32.679 --> 00:05:32.689 
filters don't work so there is just the

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:37.510
