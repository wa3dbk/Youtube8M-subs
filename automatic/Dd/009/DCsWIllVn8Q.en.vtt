00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.769
 Good day dear friends 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.050
 my name is Vladislav and in this video I 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.169
 I would like to tell you and show how 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.470
 You can play multiplayer spintires with 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:40.500
 mods for this we need to go to 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:44.820
 media folder and cut out folders 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:47.220
 I have already connected them with the mod 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.920
 Now I paste on the desktop 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:53.760
 you can paste at any convenient for 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:57.500
 you place and so here they are on the desktop 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:01.289
 we seem to be all defaulted now 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:07.200
 Now we go into the game itself, I will not find myself 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:08.820
 just a couple of seconds so expensive 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.970
 friends here I am already in the game 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.310
 Now click on the button to play and 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.759
 go to the network game section as leads 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.349
 we are showing rooms and now 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:26.489
 we need to roll the game 

00:01:21.349 --> 00:01:28.560
 what I will do now and so here I am 

00:01:26.489 --> 00:01:31.410
 turned up on the desktop now 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:36.239
 copy rather cut well or copy 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:43.009
 as it is more convenient for someone that we cut up 

00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:43.009
 this and paste it back into the media folder 

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:52.739
 here we have again installed the mod and go 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:55.289
 back to the game so dear friends i 

00:01:52.739 --> 00:02:00.899
 again in the game now let's create 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:04.500
 the room I found you 456 since 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.660
 This is a proven mod, that is, we are 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.869
 filmed with him off-road adventure then 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:13.500
 there he will 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:15.990
 he is well suited, and so let's start 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.730
 actually the game 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.630
 of course now the one who joined us 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.410
 can fly out 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:25.630
 since he doesn't have this mod let's 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.090
 let's change here with us 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:33.580
 earned that is replaced the default 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:36.610
 addons all work the same way to say 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:40.450
 that not all mods work in multiplayer 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.430
 that is, we literally recently tested 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.210
 some multiplayer mods literally 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:51.010
 three did not try to test almost all 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:55.000
 cars flew out ie units can 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:59.410
 work fine well what do you think 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.330
 understand how to do it I think that 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.340
