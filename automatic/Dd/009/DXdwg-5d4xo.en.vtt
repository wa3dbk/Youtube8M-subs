great detail on this review but a couple
things<00:02:10.050> I<00:02:10.229> will<00:02:10.349> make<00:02:10.530> mention<00:02:10.830> of

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
things I will make mention of

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.030 
things I will make mention of
is<00:02:11.800> the<00:02:12.280> signs<00:02:12.940> of<00:02:13.210> the<00:02:13.330> engines<00:02:13.960> instead<00:02:14.860> of

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
is the signs of the engines instead of

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.900 
is the signs of the engines instead of
putting<00:02:15.250> decals<00:02:16.120> or<00:02:16.830> stickers<00:02:17.830> it's<00:02:18.190> actual

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
putting decals or stickers it's actual

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:20.970 
putting decals or stickers it's actual
Lego<00:02:19.120> that<00:02:19.660> makes<00:02:19.870> those<00:02:20.020> arrows<00:02:20.470> that's

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
Lego that makes those arrows that's

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.590 
Lego that makes those arrows that's
pretty<00:02:21.340> neat<00:02:21.520> was<00:02:21.700> fun<00:02:21.880> to<00:02:21.970> build<00:02:22.090> it<00:02:22.270> as<00:02:22.390> well

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
pretty neat was fun to build it as well

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.700 
pretty neat was fun to build it as well
and<00:02:24.120> the<00:02:25.120> sticker<00:02:25.420> sheet<00:02:25.750> also<00:02:25.960> I<00:02:26.230> like

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
and the sticker sheet also I like

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.550 
and the sticker sheet also I like
because<00:02:26.950> it<00:02:27.730> gives<00:02:28.720> you<00:02:28.840> all<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:29.110> numbers<00:02:29.410> to

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
because it gives you all the numbers to

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.230 
because it gives you all the numbers to
play<00:02:29.740> with<00:02:29.920> so<00:02:30.130> you<00:02:30.190> can<00:02:30.490> put<00:02:30.910> any<00:02:31.060> number

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
play with so you can put any number

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.210 
play with so you can put any number
really<00:02:31.510> on<00:02:31.810> your<00:02:31.990> engine<00:02:32.350> instead<00:02:32.920> of<00:02:33.010> what's

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
really on your engine instead of what's

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.670 
really on your engine instead of what's
instructed<00:02:33.880> that<00:02:33.910> was<00:02:34.270> pretty<00:02:34.480> neat

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
instructed that was pretty neat

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.060 
instructed that was pretty neat
you<00:02:35.950> do<00:02:36.100> get<00:02:36.340> a<00:02:36.640> brick<00:02:37.480> separator<00:02:38.070> and

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
you do get a brick separator and

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.070 
you do get a brick separator and
obviously<00:02:39.910> some<00:02:40.120> extra<00:02:40.330> pieces<00:02:40.480> here<00:02:40.840> I<00:02:40.870> don't

a lot of the sides with it and what that

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.210 
a lot of the sides with it and what that
allows<00:03:31.090> you<00:03:31.270> to<00:03:31.390> do<00:03:31.540> is<00:03:31.810> much<00:03:32.650> easier<00:03:33.010> access

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
objects inside the train card so I

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.210

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.440 
this thing downstairs and we'll put some
motors<00:03:48.190> in<00:03:48.340> it<00:03:48.370> and<00:03:48.610> we'll<00:03:48.880> see<00:03:49.060> how<00:03:49.180> it<00:03:49.300> looks

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
motors in it and we'll see how it looks

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.440 
motors in it and we'll see how it looks
going<00:03:49.660> around<00:03:49.960> the<00:03:50.050> track<00:03:51.240> alright<00:03:52.240> guys

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
going around the track alright guys

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.210 
going around the track alright guys
we're<00:03:52.690> in<00:03:52.720> the<00:03:52.840> basement<00:03:53.020> I'm<00:03:53.830> putting<00:03:54.100> this

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
we're in the basement I'm putting this

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.860 
we're in the basement I'm putting this
thing<00:03:54.400> on<00:03:54.490> the<00:03:54.580> track<00:03:54.850> but<00:03:55.060> obviously<00:03:55.540> we<00:03:55.690> need

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
thing on the track but obviously we need

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.170 
thing on the track but obviously we need
to<00:03:56.080> motorize<00:03:56.740> it<00:03:57.010> so<00:03:57.550> I'm<00:03:57.700> actually<00:03:57.790> going<00:03:58.060> to

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
to motorize it so I'm actually going to

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.380 
to motorize it so I'm actually going to
use<00:03:58.330> the<00:03:59.290> 9-volt<00:03:59.860> motors<00:04:00.220> for<00:04:00.910> this<00:04:01.030> instead<00:04:01.330> I

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
use the 9-volt motors for this instead I

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.210 
use the 9-volt motors for this instead I
got<00:04:01.540> a<00:04:01.600> couple<00:04:01.840> of<00:04:01.990> them<00:04:02.080> that<00:04:02.950> I'm<00:04:03.040> going<00:04:03.190> to

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
got a couple of them that I'm going to

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.620 
got a couple of them that I'm going to
use<00:04:03.280> so<00:04:03.550> we're<00:04:03.640> just<00:04:03.670> going<00:04:03.850> to<00:04:03.940> swap<00:04:04.180> out<00:04:04.420> the

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
use so we're just going to swap out the

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:07.830 
use so we're just going to swap out the
the<00:04:04.990> front<00:04:05.230> end<00:04:05.440> and<00:04:06.270> just<00:04:07.270> replace<00:04:07.480> it<00:04:07.720> with

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
the front end and just replace it with

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.080 
the front end and just replace it with
the<00:04:07.959> 9-volt<00:04:08.230> and<00:04:08.830> just<00:04:09.610> click<00:04:09.730> it<00:04:09.850> in<00:04:09.940> there

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
the 9-volt and just click it in there

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.699 
the 9-volt and just click it in there
and<00:04:10.270> that's<00:04:10.840> a<00:04:10.900> lot<00:04:11.110> easier<00:04:11.140> than<00:04:11.530> power

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
and that's a lot easier than power

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:13.080 
and that's a lot easier than power
function<00:04:12.130> that<00:04:12.250> staying<00:04:12.430> power<00:04:12.640> function

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
function that staying power function

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.150 
function that staying power function
isn't<00:04:13.240> good<00:04:13.840> this<00:04:14.380> train<00:04:14.620> is<00:04:14.709> obviously

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
isn't good this train is obviously

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.690 
isn't good this train is obviously
designed<00:04:15.459> for<00:04:16.030> power<00:04:16.270> function<00:04:16.830> but<00:04:17.830> I<00:04:18.280> have<00:04:18.670> a

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
designed for power function but I have a

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.670 
designed for power function but I have a
couple<00:04:18.940> of<00:04:19.060> 9<00:04:19.180> bolts<00:04:19.510> motor<00:04:20.169> so<00:04:20.410> I'm<00:04:20.500> going<00:04:20.620> to

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
couple of 9 bolts motor so I'm going to

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.090 
couple of 9 bolts motor so I'm going to
use<00:04:20.799> them<00:04:22.350> alright<00:04:23.350> here<00:04:23.560> we<00:04:23.680> are<00:04:23.710> we're<00:04:24.070> going
