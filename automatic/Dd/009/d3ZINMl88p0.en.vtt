00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:29.900 
to harm one if I can but you know forget

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:36.629 
to harm one if I can but you know forget
in<00:05:30.050> the<00:05:30.169> way<00:05:30.789> I'm<00:05:31.789> not<00:05:32.169> I'm<00:05:33.169> not<00:05:33.229> opposed<00:05:33.979> to

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:36.639 

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:39.250 

but<00:05:37.639> there's<00:05:37.820> a<00:05:37.910> lot<00:05:38.090> of<00:05:38.300> them<00:05:38.450> you<00:05:38.990> can<00:05:39.080> see

but there's a lot of them you can see

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:47.600 
but there's a lot of them you can see
them<00:05:39.410> just<00:05:39.650> a<00:05:40.960> lot<00:05:41.960> of<00:05:42.289> a<00:05:42.680> good<00:05:43.370> many<00:05:43.639> ladybugs

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:53.290 

I<00:05:49.610> think<00:05:50.610> it's<00:05:50.729> going<00:05:50.909> to<00:05:50.969> be<00:05:51.060> a<00:05:51.090> hard<00:05:51.389> winter

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.420 
I think it's going to be a hard winter
just<00:05:54.300> my<00:05:54.870> opinion<00:05:55.439> and<00:05:55.560> I<00:05:56.009> think<00:05:56.039> it's

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430 
just my opinion and I think it's
