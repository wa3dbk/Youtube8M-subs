and talk about the clutch now on these
types<00:00:29.699> of<00:00:29.849> engines<00:00:30.240> we<00:00:30.449> have<00:00:30.480> what<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:30.990> called

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
types of engines we have what is called

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.819 
types of engines we have what is called
a<00:00:31.529> centrifugal<00:00:32.189> clutch<00:00:33.050> what<00:00:34.050> it<00:00:34.170> is<00:00:34.320> inside

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
a centrifugal clutch what it is inside

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.130 
a centrifugal clutch what it is inside
this<00:00:35.130> bell<00:00:35.399> housing<00:00:35.640> right<00:00:36.149> here<00:00:36.390> we<00:00:36.570> have<00:00:36.809> two

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
this bell housing right here we have two

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.619 
this bell housing right here we have two
clutch<00:00:37.590> shoes<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.520> in-between<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.480> these

shoes<00:00:40.020> we<00:00:40.530> have<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.829> pretty<00:00:41.309> thick<00:00:41.700> spring<00:00:42.270> as

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
shoes we have a pretty thick spring as

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.380 
shoes we have a pretty thick spring as
the<00:00:43.320> crank<00:00:43.620> shaft<00:00:43.770> turns<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:44.760> turns<00:00:45.090> the

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
the crank shaft turns it turns the

clutch the clutch is attached to the

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:48.979 
clutch the clutch is attached to the
flywheel<00:00:47.789> so<00:00:48.329> it's<00:00:48.450> moving<00:00:48.750> at<00:00:48.840> incredible

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
flywheel so it's moving at incredible

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.389 
flywheel so it's moving at incredible
speeds<00:00:49.920> at<00:00:50.160> about<00:00:50.809> 6,000<00:00:51.809> rpm<00:00:52.320> at<00:00:52.530> least<00:00:53.039> as

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
speeds at about 6,000 rpm at least as

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.850 
speeds at about 6,000 rpm at least as
you<00:00:54.000> give<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.300> engine<00:00:54.690> throttle<00:00:55.289> the

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
you give the engine throttle the

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.029 
you give the engine throttle the
flywheel<00:00:56.370> speeds<00:00:56.789> up<00:00:57.500> spinning<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.739> clutch

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
flywheel speeds up spinning the clutch

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.490 
flywheel speeds up spinning the clutch
faster<00:00:59.910> as<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.480> clutch<00:01:00.780> starts<00:01:01.170> spinning

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
faster as the clutch starts spinning

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.700 
faster as the clutch starts spinning
faster<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.399> starts<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.090> expand<00:01:03.719> once<00:01:04.470> it

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
faster it starts to expand once it

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.730 
faster it starts to expand once it
expands<00:01:05.339> far<00:01:05.610> enough<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:06.600> attaches<00:01:07.049> itself<00:01:07.229> to

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
expands far enough it attaches itself to

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.910 
expands far enough it attaches itself to
the<00:01:08.010> bell<00:01:08.220> housing<00:01:08.490> this<00:01:09.180> piece<00:01:09.510> right<00:01:09.750> here

the bell housing this piece right here
once<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:11.070> does<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.790> starts<00:01:12.210> spinning<00:01:12.479> the

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
once it does that it starts spinning the

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.310 
once it does that it starts spinning the
whole<00:01:13.250> entire<00:01:14.250> drivetrain<00:01:14.880> right<00:01:15.479> here<00:01:15.720> and

have<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.820> treat<00:01:33.119> this<00:01:33.420> engine<00:01:33.990> like<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.710> is<00:01:34.829> a

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
have to treat this engine like it is a

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.520 
have to treat this engine like it is a
manual<00:01:35.280> stick<00:01:36.060> shift<00:01:36.390> car<00:01:36.509> except<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.409> only

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
manual stick shift car except it only

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.730 
manual stick shift car except it only
has<00:01:37.799> one<00:01:37.829> gear<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:39.030> gear<00:01:39.329> is<00:01:39.479> go<00:01:39.810> the

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
has one gear and that gear is go the

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.249 
has one gear and that gear is go the
throttle<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.610> what<00:01:42.000> gives<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.479> clutch<00:01:42.780> power

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
throttle is what gives the clutch power

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.389 
throttle is what gives the clutch power
so<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.250> have<00:01:44.880> all<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.570> control<00:01:45.990> possible<00:01:46.799> by

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
so you have all the control possible by

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.450 
so you have all the control possible by
engaging<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:48.329> clutch<00:01:48.590> by<00:01:49.590> pushing<00:01:49.950> back<00:01:50.130> to
