think<00:02:27.040> first<00:02:28.040> you<00:02:28.100> need<00:02:28.280> is<00:02:28.490> a<00:02:28.520> three-hole

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
think first you need is a three-hole

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:34.330 
think first you need is a three-hole
punch<00:02:30.760> so<00:02:31.760> just<00:02:32.630> three<00:02:32.840> hole<00:02:33.080> punch<00:02:33.110> of<00:02:33.709> all<00:02:33.950> of

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
punch so just three hole punch of all of

00:02:34.340 --> 00:03:08.480 
punch so just three hole punch of all of
your<00:02:34.970> pages

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.520 

now<00:03:09.490> you're<00:03:09.730> going<00:03:09.940> to<00:03:10.030> need<00:03:10.210> string<00:03:10.870> to<00:03:11.320> bind

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
now you're going to need string to bind

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.250 
now you're going to need string to bind
the<00:03:11.680> book<00:03:11.830> together<00:03:12.600> anything<00:03:13.600> thicker<00:03:14.020> than

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
the book together anything thicker than

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.230 
the book together anything thicker than
thread<00:03:14.650> but<00:03:15.040> thinner<00:03:15.340> than<00:03:15.550> yarn<00:03:15.910> should<00:03:16.120> work

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:16.240 
thread but thinner than yarn should work

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.990 
thread but thinner than yarn should work
i'm<00:03:16.420> using<00:03:16.810> twine<00:03:17.130> now<00:03:18.130> i<00:03:18.190> know<00:03:18.430> these<00:03:18.730> things

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
i'm using twine now i know these things

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.390 
i'm using twine now i know these things
have<00:03:19.150> a<00:03:19.180> tendency<00:03:19.240> to<00:03:19.780> fall<00:03:20.020> apart<00:03:20.470> at<00:03:20.830> one<00:03:21.190> end

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
have a tendency to fall apart at one end

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.390 
have a tendency to fall apart at one end
you<00:03:21.910> can<00:03:22.120> burn<00:03:22.510> it<00:03:22.690> or<00:03:22.930> you<00:03:23.410> can<00:03:23.590> just<00:03:23.800> turn<00:03:24.280> it

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
you can burn it or you can just turn it

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.540 
you can burn it or you can just turn it
into<00:03:24.550> a<00:03:24.640> shoelace<00:03:26.160> tape<00:03:28.860> cut<00:03:29.860> a<00:03:29.890> little<00:03:30.340> bit

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
into a shoelace tape cut a little bit

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:44.240 
into a shoelace tape cut a little bit
off<00:03:31.770> and<00:03:34.200> wrap<00:03:35.200> it<00:03:35.350> at<00:03:35.470> the<00:03:35.590> end<00:03:35.650> here

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.310 

and<00:03:44.420> make<00:03:45.420> sure<00:03:45.450> you<00:03:45.600> just<00:03:45.750> twist<00:03:46.020> it<00:03:46.200> a<00:03:46.290> little

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
and make sure you just twist it a little

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.040 
and make sure you just twist it a little
bit<00:03:46.620> you're<00:03:47.220> going<00:03:47.400> to<00:03:47.490> need<00:03:47.520> about<00:03:48.090> an<00:03:48.750> arm's

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:49.050 
bit you're going to need about an arm's

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:50.990 
bit you're going to need about an arm's
length<00:03:49.230> so<00:03:49.680> just<00:03:49.950> do<00:03:50.100> some<00:03:50.250> of<00:03:50.400> that<00:03:50.610> and<00:03:50.790> that

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
length so just do some of that and that

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.060 
length so just do some of that and that
this<00:03:51.270> should<00:03:51.450> be<00:03:51.570> about<00:03:51.690> enough<00:03:52.140> string<00:03:52.440> now

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
this should be about enough string now

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.700 
this should be about enough string now
it's<00:03:53.250> time<00:03:53.520> for<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:54.060> real<00:03:54.720> binding<00:03:55.140> art<00:03:55.290> so<00:03:55.530> if

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:55.710 
it's time for the real binding art so if

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:57.650 
it's time for the real binding art so if
you<00:03:55.830> use<00:03:56.040> the<00:03:56.220> tape<00:03:56.460> like<00:03:56.760> I<00:03:56.910> did<00:03:57.150> you<00:03:57.300> can<00:03:57.450> just

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
you use the tape like I did you can just

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.120 
you use the tape like I did you can just
attach<00:03:57.780> it<00:03:58.230> to<00:03:58.260> the<00:03:58.530> end<00:03:58.710> of<00:03:58.830> your<00:03:58.920> bamboo

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
attach it to the end of your bamboo

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.180 
attach it to the end of your bamboo
skewer<00:03:59.640> and<00:04:00.230> now<00:04:01.230> the<00:04:01.290> Bamber's<00:04:01.709> do<00:04:01.830> behave

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
skewer and now the Bamber's do behave

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:34.600 
skewer and now the Bamber's do behave
like<00:04:02.400> a<00:04:02.459> needle<00:04:02.700> so

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:40.700 

and<00:04:35.690> just<00:04:37.520> read<00:04:38.630> the<00:04:39.630> other<00:04:39.810> one<00:04:40.170> through<00:04:40.530> the

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
and just read the other one through the

00:04:40.710 --> 00:05:57.380 
and just read the other one through the
other<00:04:41.010> hole

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.390 

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.990 

once<00:05:58.050> you<00:05:58.200> have<00:05:58.410> it<00:05:58.530> threaded<00:05:58.860> through<00:05:59.340> on<00:05:59.610> one

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
once you have it threaded through on one

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:09.010 
once you have it threaded through on one
and<00:06:00.980> tie<00:06:01.980> it

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:09.020 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.350 

make<00:06:09.740> sure<00:06:09.770> it's<00:06:10.009> tight<00:06:10.129> but<00:06:10.370> not<00:06:10.940> too<00:06:11.120> tight

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 
make sure it's tight but not too tight

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:15.070 
make sure it's tight but not too tight
you<00:06:11.720> don't<00:06:11.900> want<00:06:12.020> the<00:06:12.080> paper<00:06:12.259> to<00:06:12.500> rip<00:06:13.300> and<00:06:14.300> you

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.080 
you don't want the paper to rip and you

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.689 
you don't want the paper to rip and you
might<00:06:15.289> want<00:06:15.500> to<00:06:15.560> just<00:06:15.680> give<00:06:15.919> it<00:06:16.069> and<00:06:16.280> really

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:16.699 
might want to just give it and really

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:22.540 
might want to just give it and really
you<00:06:17.150> know<00:06:19.810> okay<00:06:20.810> and<00:06:21.080> just<00:06:21.409> run<00:06:22.250> it<00:06:22.340> through

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:22.550 
you know okay and just run it through

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:23.740 
you know okay and just run it through
again<00:06:22.580> this<00:06:22.970> time<00:06:23.120> you're<00:06:23.270> gonna<00:06:23.330> have<00:06:23.479> to<00:06:23.569> cut

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:23.750 
again this time you're gonna have to cut

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:28.960 
again this time you're gonna have to cut
off<00:06:23.870> the<00:06:24.080> ends<00:06:25.930> ok<00:06:27.190> once<00:06:28.190> you've<00:06:28.430> thread

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:28.970 
off the ends ok once you've thread

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:32.469 
off the ends ok once you've thread
through<00:06:29.330> both<00:06:29.539> make<00:06:30.289> sure<00:06:30.729> once<00:06:31.729> you've<00:06:31.970> read

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:32.479 
through both make sure once you've read

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:36.279 
through both make sure once you've read
the<00:06:32.690> both<00:06:32.930> sides<00:06:33.349> is<00:06:33.740> twice<00:06:35.110> think<00:06:36.110> of<00:06:36.229> your

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:36.289 
the both sides is twice think of your

00:06:36.289 --> 00:06:37.719 
the both sides is twice think of your
book<00:06:36.500> is<00:06:36.680> the<00:06:36.830> probably<00:06:37.159> the<00:06:37.250> more<00:06:37.460> you<00:06:37.669> should

00:06:37.719 --> 00:06:37.729 
book is the probably the more you should

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:42.879 
book is the probably the more you should
do<00:06:38.210> but<00:06:38.590> put<00:06:39.590> this<00:06:39.849> lambda<00:06:40.849> h<00:06:41.210> 2<00:06:42.199> should<00:06:42.440> be<00:06:42.470> ok

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:42.889 
do but put this lambda h 2 should be ok

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:47.260 
do but put this lambda h 2 should be ok
now<00:06:43.599> it's<00:06:44.599> time<00:06:44.870> you<00:06:44.900> just<00:06:45.530> tie<00:06:46.460> and<00:06:46.849> not<00:06:47.030> just

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:47.270 
now it's time you just tie and not just

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:49.600 
now it's time you just tie and not just
like<00:06:47.419> i<00:06:47.539> have<00:06:47.659> your<00:06:47.780> tying<00:06:48.050> your<00:06:48.199> shoe<00:06:48.610> make

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:49.610 
like i have your tying your shoe make

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:57.340 
like i have your tying your shoe make
sure<00:06:49.639> it's<00:06:49.880> tight<00:06:49.970> but<00:06:50.180> be<00:06:50.780> careful

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:57.350 

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:59.560 

my<00:06:58.010> experience<00:06:58.640> it's<00:06:58.790> probably<00:06:59.120> better<00:06:59.450> to

00:06:59.560 --> 00:06:59.570 
my experience it's probably better to

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:08.320 
my experience it's probably better to
double-knot<00:07:00.560> it<00:07:00.890> than<00:07:01.130> anything<00:07:01.460> else<00:07:07.330> yeah

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:08.330 
double-knot it than anything else yeah

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:09.940 
double-knot it than anything else yeah
I'll<00:07:08.570> just<00:07:08.630> do<00:07:08.840> the<00:07:08.960> same<00:07:09.170> thing<00:07:09.470> to<00:07:09.650> the<00:07:09.800> next

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:09.950 
I'll just do the same thing to the next

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:12.010 
I'll just do the same thing to the next
two<00:07:10.250> holes<00:07:10.520> except<00:07:11.090> make<00:07:11.390> sure<00:07:11.540> the<00:07:11.660> knot<00:07:11.810> is

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:12.020 
two holes except make sure the knot is

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.110 
two holes except make sure the knot is
on<00:07:12.230> the<00:07:12.350> other<00:07:12.440> side<00:07:12.530> that<00:07:12.920> the<00:07:13.250> end<00:07:13.430> of<00:07:13.700> all

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:14.120 
on the other side that the end of all

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.850 
on the other side that the end of all
this<00:07:14.150> binding<00:07:14.630> you<00:07:14.780> should<00:07:14.930> have<00:07:15.110> one<00:07:15.410> knot<00:07:15.680> on

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:15.860 
this binding you should have one knot on

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.830 
this binding you should have one knot on
one<00:07:15.890> side<00:07:16.340> when<00:07:16.940> not<00:07:17.120> on<00:07:17.240> the<00:07:17.330> other<00:07:17.480> there

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:17.840 
one side when not on the other there

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.710 
one side when not on the other there
should<00:07:18.140> be<00:07:18.410> about<00:07:18.760> two<00:07:19.760> to<00:07:19.940> three<00:07:19.970> layers<00:07:20.420> or

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:20.720
