00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.959
 good to all welcome once more 

00:00:02.259 --> 00:00:07.810
 to the channel today we are here for a video 

00:00:04.959 --> 00:00:11.050
 somewhat peculiar how to catch respawn in 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.910
 the slums map is very simple and now 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.890
 you will see it in agreement I put you in 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.810
 background I was playing so 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:18.730
 normal with my friends to the third 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.100
 game and then in the third game 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:25.330
 on the same map I realized what 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:26.890
 it really happened and when I saw it I said uy this 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.770
 I have to record it so that my 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.499
 subs then when I saw it I started 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.149
 record it and I really realized 

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:37.120
 how far the situation went is 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:39.219
 say you can catch a respawn very very 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.379
 simple even getting into the 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:44.140
 enemy support you continue to do in 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:46.269
 the lateral or just behind is to say you 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.729
 you block that backup was playing in 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:50.409
 I duel by teams and directly you 

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:52.870
 appears on the other side that I had to 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:54.280
 There were so many enemies 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.049
 that I had to compose a 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.059
 light machine gun you already know that I 

00:00:56.049 --> 00:01:00.249
 they like me a lot and I got fucked 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:03.579
 lightly and I started killing to kill 

00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:05.439
 kill kill and kill so now 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:06.640
 I present the video I hope that what 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:08.950
 enjoy 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.470
 more or less how to do it is very easy 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.020
 so inside video 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.360
 a yuyu and before you open your eyes 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.780
 because here with closed eyes you do not see 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.730
 nothing good as you are seeing we are in 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.580
 the map of slums and if what you see at 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.860
 final is a guardian is to say a 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.440
 heat turret I put myself here so that 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.940
 you see that is where my 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.740
 allies and that's where I should have 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.560
 an enemy support we are not 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.940
 blocking with that turret and then at 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.790
 block it myself right now I 'm 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.920
 directing to the place where they are 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.720
 reappearing the enemies I have caught 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.640
 this is light machine gun because I 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.700
 I am swelling to kill and the truth that 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.860
 I can not anymore with a normal weapon like 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.380
 you are seeing I am pointing the area 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.330
 where they are reappearing and I direct 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.130
 now to look for them you see they are 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.950
 all reappearing there at the end where 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.440
 he killed one and where I recommend self 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.860
 behind the van that is the area 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:09.170
 where everyone is responding is 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.990
 say that we need then we need 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:15.400
 a guardian 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:18.580
 we need a team and we need a 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.110
 how many bullets weapon arming 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.840
 the best because since we place 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.870
 guardian in our respawn so that the 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.150
 others are not born there and what we have to 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.890
 to do is to endure and to endure because you 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.140
 you can get in but nobody is going to be born 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.480
 there so I hope you liked it 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:39.060
 the video and that you kill a lot thanks to 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.060
 this many thanks to everyone and even another
