goal line and you know so we try to
create<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.790> energetic<00:00:51.390> atmosphere<00:00:51.750> because

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
create a energetic atmosphere because

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.960

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
washington and notre dame all these

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.270 
washington and notre dame all these
places<00:00:58.260> are<00:00:58.470> to<00:00:58.620> go<00:00:58.770> it's<00:00:58.950> going<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.160> be<00:00:59.250> very

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
places are to go it's going to be very

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.310 
places are to go it's going to be very
loud<00:00:59.700> and<00:01:00.000> you're<00:01:00.629> going<00:01:00.750> to<00:01:00.809> have<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.110> focus

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
loud and you're going to have to focus

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.000 
loud and you're going to have to focus
on<00:01:01.830> a<00:01:01.860> half<00:01:02.040> demonstration<00:01:02.760> so<00:01:03.530> we<00:01:04.530> created<00:01:04.890> an

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
on a half demonstration so we created an

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.880 
on a half demonstration so we created an
environment<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.550> the<00:01:05.700> players<00:01:05.940> were<00:01:06.890> most

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
environment that the players were most

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.190 
environment that the players were most
likely<00:01:07.979> would<00:01:08.190> be<00:01:08.310> in<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.460> game<00:01:08.610> so<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.660> just

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
likely would be in a game so I just

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.719 
likely would be in a game so I just
that's<00:01:10.590> only<00:01:10.680> way<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:10.890> not<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.100> practice<00:01:11.520> goal

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
that's only way I not a practice goal

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.460 
that's only way I not a practice goal
line<00:01:11.910> and<00:01:12.479> make<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.750> realistic<00:01:12.990> for<00:01:13.320> these

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
line and make it realistic for these

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.770 
line and make it realistic for these
guys<00:01:13.619> now<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.580> was<00:01:14.700> good<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:14.910> see<00:01:15.030> no<00:01:15.300> penalties

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
guys now it was good to see no penalties

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.719 
guys now it was good to see no penalties
no<00:01:16.020> bird<00:01:16.440> I<00:01:16.770> think<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.310> lot<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.430> times<00:01:17.640> you're

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
no bird I think a lot of times you're

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.190 
no bird I think a lot of times you're
going<00:01:17.759> to<00:01:17.910> go<00:01:18.030> on<00:01:18.150> situations<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:18.780> guys<00:01:18.960> fall

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
going to go on situations and guys fall

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.120 
going to go on situations and guys fall
star<00:01:19.530> because<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:19.860> haven't<00:01:20.070> practiced
