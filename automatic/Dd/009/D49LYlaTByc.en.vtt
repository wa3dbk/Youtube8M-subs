00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.430
 Hello all dear friends with you and 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.519
 positive and today i would like to show 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.030
 the battle that took place on the streamer at Dzirt 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.799
 give 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.929
 I have ryko at seryoga and show him from 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.330
 of my face because I have some 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.060
 This is all the more requested 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:23.310
 how I won the show that is and that's it 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.650
 that's all we have, I see 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.680
 drove a mass of 5 in general is a gang or 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.380
 I chose why I never saw that 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.450
 I was picked up immediately bought this one 105 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.120
 run at all because in the hangar 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.640
 and there was no equipment 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.610
 just loaded 12 high-explosive shells and 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.219
 immediately rushed into battle see what u have 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.110
 shelling just 12 shells but why am I 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.520
 I chose her because recharge 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.579
 she quickly and as well on 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.199
 crew up to 75 percent costs and therefore 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.960
 recharging is not as fast as 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.640
 I would like to but 17 seconds here and immediately 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.710
 do we have a huge amount of them 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.160
 moving first objects you see that 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.920
 they took 9 mostly level 10 and here 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.020
 just this in this show autodrome not 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.060
 will steer guys if you take 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.030
 some small artillery that is she 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.509
 shoots faster she more accurately she faster 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.640
 comes down that is and you can punch 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:19.470
 high-level art even without any 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.830
 problems you look the same on the example 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:27.240
 gogo tiger see i sit on it 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:28.979
 I throw projectile yes I hit him I do not know 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.700
 broke through but most likely I would break 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.590
 his fence 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.650
 because we'll still go straight to my 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.460
 pierce your forehead with your head and basically 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.070
 should be enough 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.470
 you see that penetrability is 75 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.869
 millimeters and armor at fuel and artillery 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.030
 not even all this one except 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.850
 there is a new body qr cinnamon me there 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.770
 general armor in the forehead is powerful but there are such 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.630
 Something not met you see she until 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.619
 rare in randomness and so you can play 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.729
 on small arte 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:59.100
 plus they have in 304 these which you 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.790
 also swim just very fast here 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.810
 see how I sit on object 212 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:15.290
 he leaves the light I throw a shell 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:18.170
 the trail and the 12 tooth center have been destroyed 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.989
 already door or ninth level 1 6 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:24.019
 level and that's how it happens why I 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:26.090
 took this position look i became this 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:30.290
 the corner on this map why i won't borrow 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:33.590
 for example brilliant green as 61 because 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.300
 to drill all these streets here 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.880
 these are the ones who shoot in the city 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.370
 from this position well and that's it for 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.860
 this i became now i threw pav in but she 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.819
 there was moving moving and got 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.190
 cover only 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:48.920
 that is, I covered it with more splashes 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.230
 nothing came of it trying to 30 not 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.730
 have time for the kind object and here's the whole 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.680
 battle tactic is 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.780
 especially the beginning of the battle how to inhabit more 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.330
 Damaga in this show autodrome 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.310
 I just stand behind the house 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.019
 periodically see a Christmas tree arrives 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.000
 very dangerous to flash us and me 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:08.269
 you have to constantly push up to this 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.170
 the little house that I have not killed here such here 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:14.420
 affairs guys bye 23 bye and here me 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.829
 starts to spit fv304 i understand that 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.780
 need to change position because the tree 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:20.299
 here constantly checks it constantly 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.579
 highlights and I'm already moving out here for 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:25.220
 for this house so that you would me 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:28.340
 I did n't get any more now I see 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:31.280
 that asses sticks out 51 not you here by the projectile 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.049
 flies but still due to the fact that my 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.450
 art rate of fire today than there 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.950
 I can leave without problems 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.739
 rechargeable enough 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.530
 quickly artillery here here 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:44.540
 come down we start fv304 but this is art 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.730
 small very fast and very 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.350
 rate of fire in the region of 10 11 seconds 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:51.230
 Probably I donâ€™t know exactly the recharge 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:53.750
 remember but she has her flaw 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.480
 what you need to come closer is not the whole 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.670
 card she shoots and even on some 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.680
 even half to lack that is 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.480
 need to quickly move closer to 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.250
 opponent to get up there like that 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.410
 and she's so small and fast 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.810
 her invisibility is good and possible 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:13.160
 stand here I see the corpse is moving here in 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:17.239
 impudent artillery from some kind of rolls it 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:18.680
 and you're here flash drive gets arrogant I shoot 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.870
 and she will drive off for an hour 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.030
 and it will not get you can see it 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:26.810
 on the stream, by the way, who has not seen the stream are 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:30.530
 the drum you can see the links i 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:32.330
 leave in the description of this stream but for now 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.000
 We continue to watch what I did next and 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.110
 score 86 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.240
 look here here is an interesting point 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.960
 a and max does not allow to turn 10 1 and 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:45.380
 still the very last moment mx not 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.940
 can punch 61 at that angle and he 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.740
 turns around just picks it up I 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.810
 trying to target but you don't get 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.570
 here I shoot at random thought he 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.229
 Malinka will drive off and it remains with me 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.810
 5 charges 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:58.610
 I already did two frags and see that 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.470
 shows me that just 130 inflicted 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.660
 damage but if you take into account that I killed 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:06.259
 the object here is 12 complete seemingly without 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:08.449
 the light fired him there and now plus 

00:05:06.259 --> 00:05:10.820
 food play just finish mode 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:13.780
 already bout 3 exam remains or 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.770
 need to go to notice the grill here 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:17.570
 let's slow down a bit to 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.130
 I already used the first-aid kit 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.259
 because I do not remember that he can not 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.270
 something savage how open but love you 

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:25.370
 here I stand and think where to look 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:28.580
 vulture in what direction hope neither 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:30.110
 I'm already starting to worry here 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:40.849
 little as it needs to be changed often 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:43.120
 watched takin calmly me again 

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:45.979
 rolling back to get out of the light 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:48.740
 further remains 2 61 objects until i 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:50.270
 I know where and then because I see that he 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.159
 glowed and it flashes sharply with 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.970
 on my left I think we'll go 

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:55.580
 now here here 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:56.800
 but he decides to drive around there with the left 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.180
 parties 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.270
 see what I'm doing now in this 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.270
 moment 

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:21.080
 kills four arties nadamagil there 1300 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:23.870
 something damage and remains one tree now 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.500
 it will be taken away and all here is such a fight 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:26.630

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:30.860
