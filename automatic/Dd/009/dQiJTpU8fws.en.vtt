what that is trying to alert me is that

depth and if I go here to select gas

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.400 
depth and if I go here to select gas
will<00:02:39.690> see<00:02:39.959> that<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:40.860> better<00:02:41.160> gas<00:02:41.459> is<00:02:41.790> already

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
will see that the better gas is already

will see that the better gas is already
selected<00:02:43.410> here<00:02:44.070> and<00:02:44.220> I<00:02:44.760> just<00:02:44.790> have<00:02:45.090> to<00:02:45.209> press

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
at the highest oxygen content gas and so
