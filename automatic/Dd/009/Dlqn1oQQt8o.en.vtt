00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
that our dent tries to access that

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.600 
that our dent tries to access that
folder<00:00:48.230> it<00:00:49.230> will<00:00:49.440> give<00:00:49.739> me<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.920> warning<00:00:50.219> but

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
folder it will give me a warning but

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.650 
folder it will give me a warning but
I've<00:00:50.700> still<00:00:50.820> got<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.030> do<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.149> couple<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.510> more

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
I've still got to do a couple of more

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.150 
I've still got to do a couple of more
settings<00:00:52.879> so<00:00:53.879> I've<00:00:54.149> set<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.539> settings<00:00:54.870> on<00:00:55.110> the

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:55.160 
settings so I've set the settings on the

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.729 
settings so I've set the settings on the
confidential<00:00:56.160> folder<00:00:57.379> and<00:00:58.379> I<00:00:58.440> want<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.649> look

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
confidential folder and I want to look

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.390 
confidential folder and I want to look
at<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.070> make<00:00:59.160> sure<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.520> it's<00:00:59.670> there<00:01:01.190> right

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:11.090 

it's<00:01:05.400> all<00:01:05.580> failure<00:01:06.030> yes<00:01:06.710> ok<00:01:07.710> so<00:01:09.710> you<00:01:10.710> can<00:01:10.799> see

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
it's all failure yes ok so you can see

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.960 
it's all failure yes ok so you can see
our<00:01:11.460> dent<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.210> in<00:01:12.960> Active<00:01:13.890> Directory<00:01:13.920> this<00:01:14.790> is

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
our dent is in Active Directory this is

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.679 
our dent is in Active Directory this is
a<00:01:15.000> domain<00:01:15.479> controller<00:01:16.939> so<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.119> next<00:01:18.299> step<00:01:18.509> is

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
a domain controller so the next step is

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.749 
a domain controller so the next step is
to<00:01:18.840> create<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.140> group<00:01:19.530> policy<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:20.490> this<00:01:20.640> is

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
to create a group policy so this is

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.210 
to create a group policy so this is
group<00:01:20.970> policy<00:01:21.420> management<00:01:21.450> console

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
group policy management console

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.910 
group policy management console
available<00:01:23.220> from<00:01:23.369> admin<00:01:23.759> tools<00:01:24.500> group<00:01:25.500> policy

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
available from admin tools group policy

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.749 
available from admin tools group policy
management<00:01:27.650> so<00:01:28.650> then<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.860> group<00:01:29.490> policy

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
management so then a group policy

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.550 
management so then a group policy
objects<00:01:30.479> we<00:01:30.570> want<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.810> right-click<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.259> make

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
a new group policy object we'll call

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:41.780 
a new group policy object we'll call
this<00:01:36.619> object<00:01:37.619> access<00:01:39.979> and<00:01:40.979> I<00:01:41.040> want<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.280> edit

this object access and I want to edit

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.770 
this object access and I want to edit
this<00:01:42.000> group<00:01:42.360> policy

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
audit directory service access that's

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.840 
audit directory service access that's
when<00:02:45.980> um<00:02:46.190> when<00:02:47.290> you<00:02:48.290> audit<00:02:48.620> event<00:02:48.860> specified

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
when um when you audit event specified

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.300 
when um when you audit event specified
on<00:02:50.180> the<00:02:50.420> security<00:02:51.380> of<00:02:51.410> objects<00:02:52.010> in<00:02:52.160> Active

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.830

so<00:02:54.110> that<00:02:55.040> audit<00:02:55.400> Active<00:02:56.030> Directory<00:02:56.150> changes

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
so that audit Active Directory changes

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.310 
so that audit Active Directory changes
basically<00:02:57.940> logon<00:02:58.940> events<00:02:59.080> now<00:03:00.080> this<00:03:00.200> is<00:03:00.290> a

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
basically logon events now this is a

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.630 
basically logon events now this is a
little<00:03:00.440> different<00:03:00.769> than<00:03:00.890> account<00:03:01.280> logon

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
little different than account logon

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.130 
little different than account logon
events<00:03:01.790> this<00:03:02.150> is<00:03:02.239> when<00:03:02.360> you<00:03:02.480> authenticate<00:03:03.110> to

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
events this is when you authenticate to

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.410 
events this is when you authenticate to
the<00:03:03.260> computer<00:03:03.730> logon<00:03:04.730> events<00:03:04.850> is<00:03:05.209> when<00:03:05.390> I

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
the computer logon events is when I

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:12.009 
the computer logon events is when I
think<00:03:05.989> eight<00:03:06.370> to<00:03:07.370> any<00:03:07.790> computer<00:03:10.330> so<00:03:11.330> therefore

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
think eight to any computer so therefore

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:18.729 
think eight to any computer so therefore
if<00:03:12.290> I<00:03:13.120> access<00:03:14.120> a<00:03:14.299> folder<00:03:15.040> remotely<00:03:16.989> then<00:03:17.989> that

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
if I access a folder remotely then that

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:23.490 
if I access a folder remotely then that
that<00:03:19.700> event<00:03:19.880> is<00:03:20.299> recorded<00:03:20.510> on<00:03:20.989> that<00:03:21.620> machine

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
that event is recorded on that machine

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:30.130 
that event is recorded on that machine
so<00:03:27.160> it<00:03:28.160> creates<00:03:28.760> an<00:03:28.850> event<00:03:28.970> when<00:03:29.269> I<00:03:29.299> log<00:03:29.810> on<00:03:30.019> to

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
so it creates an event when I log on to

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.319 
so it creates an event when I log on to
the<00:03:30.230> computer<00:03:30.320> and<00:03:33.579> so<00:03:34.579> when<00:03:34.730> I<00:03:34.760> log<00:03:35.030> into<00:03:35.209> the

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:35.329 
the computer and so when I log into the

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:44.330 
the computer and so when I log into the
domain<00:03:35.720> it<00:03:35.900> creates<00:03:36.140> event<00:03:36.440> on<00:03:36.650> the<00:03:36.769> DC

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.890 

wait<00:03:45.340> when<00:03:45.730> I<00:03:45.760> log<00:03:46.239> on<00:03:46.420> to<00:03:46.659> the<00:03:48.090> to<00:03:49.090> the<00:03:49.209> domain

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
wait when I log on to the to the domain

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.350 
wait when I log on to the to the domain
it<00:03:50.140> doesn't<00:03:50.590> audit<00:03:50.950> account<00:03:51.610> logon<00:03:51.970> event

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
it doesn't audit account logon event

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.350 
it doesn't audit account logon event
when<00:03:52.959> I<00:03:52.989> log<00:03:53.290> on<00:03:53.560> to<00:03:53.980> a<00:03:54.010> machine<00:03:54.280> it<00:03:54.819> creates<00:03:55.150> a

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
when I log on to a machine it creates a

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.589 
when I log on to a machine it creates a
logon<00:03:56.200> event<00:03:56.549> so<00:03:57.549> the<00:03:57.879> difference<00:03:58.209> being<00:03:58.390> when

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599 
logon event so the difference being when

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:00.089 
logon event so the difference being when
I<00:03:58.629> log<00:03:58.870> into<00:03:59.049> computer<00:03:59.500> it<00:03:59.590> does<00:03:59.709> the<00:03:59.830> account

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
I log into computer it does the account

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:02.729 
I log into computer it does the account
login<00:04:00.400> event<00:04:00.640> when<00:04:01.360> I<00:04:01.390> log<00:04:01.629> on<00:04:01.810> to<00:04:02.650> the

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:02.739 
login event when I log on to the

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.100 
login event when I log on to the
computer<00:04:02.830> it<00:04:03.549> creates<00:04:04.090> a<00:04:04.239> logon<00:04:04.629> event<00:04:04.930> as

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
computer it creates a logon event as

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.470 
computer it creates a logon event as
well<00:04:05.379> but<00:04:05.769> it<00:04:05.890> also<00:04:06.069> makes<00:04:06.489> one<00:04:06.730> when<00:04:06.910> I<00:04:06.940> access

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
well but it also makes one when I access

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.430 
well but it also makes one when I access
a<00:04:07.660> folder<00:04:08.230> over<00:04:09.099> the<00:04:09.220> network<00:04:09.400> because<00:04:09.940> I'm

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
a folder over the network because I'm

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.600 
a folder over the network because I'm
authenticating<00:04:11.440> to<00:04:11.620> that<00:04:11.799> remote<00:04:12.129> computer

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
authenticating to that remote computer

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.460 
authenticating to that remote computer
these<00:04:13.420> two<00:04:13.569> events<00:04:13.870> are<00:04:13.930> pretty<00:04:14.019> close<00:04:14.290> and<00:04:14.440> I

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
these two events are pretty close and I

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.759 
these two events are pretty close and I
get<00:04:14.590> a<00:04:14.620> mixed<00:04:14.920> up<00:04:15.040> quite<00:04:15.310> a<00:04:15.340> bit<00:04:16.139> so<00:04:17.139> audit

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
get a mixed up quite a bit so audit

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.610 
get a mixed up quite a bit so audit
object<00:04:18.190> access<00:04:18.639> that<00:04:18.880> means<00:04:19.410> that's<00:04:20.410> when<00:04:20.590> I

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
object access that means that's when I

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.350 
object access that means that's when I
access<00:04:21.160> a<00:04:21.400> an<00:04:22.020> object<00:04:23.020> such<00:04:23.470> as<00:04:23.500> the<00:04:23.740> folder

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
access a an object such as the folder

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:29.490 
access a an object such as the folder
object<00:04:25.360> a<00:04:25.620> audit<00:04:26.620> a<00:04:26.740> policy<00:04:27.250> change<00:04:27.490> so<00:04:28.500> that's

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
object a audit a policy change so that's

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.010 
object a audit a policy change so that's
going<00:04:29.680> to<00:04:29.740> audit<00:04:30.210> events<00:04:31.210> that<00:04:31.360> modify<00:04:31.750> user

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
going to audit events that modify user

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.490 
going to audit events that modify user
rights<00:04:33.240> privilege<00:04:34.240> use<00:04:34.479> so<00:04:34.900> if<00:04:35.020> I<00:04:35.139> do<00:04:35.199> anything

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
rights privilege use so if I do anything

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.689 
rights privilege use so if I do anything
that<00:04:35.710> requires<00:04:35.889> a<00:04:38.190> audits<00:04:39.190> the<00:04:39.340> use<00:04:39.490> of

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:39.699 
that requires a audits the use of

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:41.100 
that requires a audits the use of
privilege<00:04:40.150> or<00:04:40.300> user<00:04:40.479> right<00:04:40.750> I<00:04:40.780> couldn't

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
privilege or user right I couldn't

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:42.420 
privilege or user right I couldn't
really<00:04:41.199> find<00:04:41.410> out<00:04:41.590> a<00:04:41.620> lot<00:04:41.800> about<00:04:41.860> this<00:04:42.250> guy

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
really find out a lot about this guy

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.600 
really find out a lot about this guy
that's<00:04:43.000> why<00:04:43.240> I<00:04:43.270> made<00:04:43.780> a<00:04:43.810> note<00:04:44.020> about<00:04:44.289> it<00:04:44.610> audit

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
that's why I made a note about it audit

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.120 
that's why I made a note about it audit
process<00:04:46.270> tracking<00:04:46.870> so<00:04:47.440> that's<00:04:47.889> going<00:04:48.070> to

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
process tracking so that's going to

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.969 
process tracking so that's going to
audit<00:04:48.490> events<00:04:48.880> such<00:04:49.030> as<00:04:49.289> program<00:04:50.289> activation

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:50.979 
audit events such as program activation

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:55.620 
audit events such as program activation
and<00:04:51.479> process<00:04:52.479> exit<00:04:53.020> and<00:04:53.229> then<00:04:54.220> audit<00:04:55.210> system

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
and process exit and then audit system

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.860 
and process exit and then audit system
events<00:04:56.520> audit<00:04:57.520> system<00:04:57.789> events<00:04:58.090> will<00:04:58.240> audit

00:04:58.860 --> 00:04:58.870 
events audit system events will audit

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.400 
events audit system events will audit
events<00:04:59.200> in<00:04:59.410> the<00:05:00.120> in<00:05:01.120> the<00:05:01.479> computer<00:05:01.870> basically

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
events in the in the computer basically

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.680 
events in the in the computer basically
it's<00:05:02.800> pretty<00:05:02.919> self-explanatory<00:05:03.389> the<00:05:04.389> big<00:05:04.539> one

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
it's pretty self-explanatory the big one

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.560 
it's pretty self-explanatory the big one
is<00:05:04.870> logon<00:05:05.530> events<00:05:05.789> which<00:05:06.789> will<00:05:07.000> when<00:05:07.270> I<00:05:07.300> log

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
is logon events which will when I log

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.110
