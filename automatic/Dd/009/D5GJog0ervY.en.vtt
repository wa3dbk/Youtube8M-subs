his right arm this was pretty easy to

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.410 
his right arm this was pretty easy to
make<00:00:30.539> it<00:00:30.689> was<00:00:30.810> um<00:00:31.170> took<00:00:31.920> about<00:00:32.130> an<00:00:32.279> hour<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:32.820> I

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
make it was um took about an hour and I

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:34.880 
make it was um took about an hour and I
made<00:00:33.630> these<00:00:33.809> buttonholes<00:00:34.469> on<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.649> sewing

made these buttonholes on a sewing
machine<00:00:36.440> it<00:00:37.440> was<00:00:37.680> pretty<00:00:38.070> difficult<00:00:38.250> but<00:00:38.910> if

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
machine it was pretty difficult but if

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.639 
machine it was pretty difficult but if
you<00:00:39.329> look<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:39.570> up<00:00:39.600> yeah<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:40.020> think<00:00:40.110> he'd<00:00:40.410> be<00:00:40.530> able

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
you look it up yeah I think he'd be able

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.580 
you look it up yeah I think he'd be able
to<00:00:40.800> make<00:00:40.920> it<00:00:40.980> and<00:00:41.629> I<00:00:42.629> also<00:00:43.050> made<00:00:43.530> a<00:00:43.559> new<00:00:43.800> bow<00:00:44.040> I

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
to make it and I also made a new bow I

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.160 
to make it and I also made a new bow I
showed<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.620> different<00:00:46.829> one<00:00:47.219> but<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:48.059> decided<00:00:48.870> it

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
showed a different one but I decided it

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.439 
showed a different one but I decided it
wasn't<00:00:49.379> as<00:00:49.590> good<00:00:49.829> it<00:00:50.100> wasn't<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.969> didn't<00:00:51.329> look

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
wasn't as good it wasn't it didn't look

wasn't as good it wasn't it didn't look
like<00:00:51.510> Connors<00:00:52.170> so<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:52.829> decided<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.309> make<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.520> new

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699
