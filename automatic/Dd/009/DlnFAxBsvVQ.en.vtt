00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.389
 can we Brazil it's a real 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.370
 back to basics for this sport that has 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.269
 leads the whole world do you think that 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.520
 this will bring a dimension 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.150
 particular the competition if yes 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.340
 which 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.710
 not necessarily anyway a cut 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.240
 of the world in brazil will be different from 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.490
 all that of all that all 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.660
 players have lived until now 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.920
 because it's quite special because 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.009
 that because maybe it's 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.090
 call anyway such a football 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.610
 but maybe it's still broken 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.329
 visit all that and I feel more 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:43.410
 close to precisely those of this game 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.640
 so unfortunately for me because 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.600
 they did not participate 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.350
 even bernard if this pastor like gimone 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.730
 unfortunately for us we would have 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:57.570
 loved but but it will be a show a 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.219
 great show and the robot with 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.960
 a lot of interest after a brilliant 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.160
 career the players you chose to 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.329
 you reconvert in the trades 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.769
 drive 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.659
 what did you learn the most 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.920
 your life as a player and you 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.740
 want to send you today to 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.570
 your turn simply shares it 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.040
 because me when I look at my 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:16.020
 career why I made football 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.299
 it's because it's because 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.590
 it was a collective sport I 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.509
 play soccer because I was with 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.210
 buddies and it's just sharing 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.380
 mans who does it matter to me today is that 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.720
 I stopped my career as a player 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.220
 come back to that 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.830
 to what I have in the heart concept to 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.220
 part I give you my guts and I 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.810
 meaning that I can convey that's it 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.670
 differently what I learned then 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.190
 today it is more certainly more 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.960
 complicated because it's all over 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.380
 do the same job but I still 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:48.680
 this faith and this desire to transmit 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.170
 to all the young people who come to dream 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.460
 is free the reality has learned as 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.270
 that player and especially as 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.430
 coach 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.950
 that inspires you with this dream quote 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:01.310
 free yes finally I did I did 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:04.150
 all my life all my childhood I dreamed 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.920
 precisely to make a career 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:08.510
 professional 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.870
 I am well behaved I managed to 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:13.400
 achieve goals that have been 

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:17.060
 just hard to throw young 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.820
 but by dint of bond work and 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.670
 seriously you arrive at the mercy of 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.020
 mountains and the goal in fact it takes 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.320
 you have to believe it to believe in your 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.209
 dreams 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.270
 and when you feel like screen and me 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:32.570

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:35.170
 got to do a lot of guys a good 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:39.170
