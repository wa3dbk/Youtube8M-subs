00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
and I do not suggest um for the back of

your<00:02:20.260> head<00:02:20.440> to<00:02:20.830> have<00:02:21.190> the<00:02:21.340> fan<00:02:21.520> behind<00:02:21.790> you

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
your head to have the fan behind you

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.640 
your head to have the fan behind you
because<00:02:22.209> when<00:02:22.720> the<00:02:22.810> fan<00:02:22.959> blows<00:02:23.230> our<00:02:23.260> hair<00:02:23.410> in

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
because when the fan blows our hair in

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.620 
because when the fan blows our hair in
the<00:02:23.739> opposite<00:02:24.099> direction<00:02:24.310> it's<00:02:24.940> just<00:02:25.330> going

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
the opposite direction it's just going

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.660 
the opposite direction it's just going
to<00:02:25.660> cause<00:02:25.870> frizz<00:02:26.260> I<00:02:26.590> know<00:02:26.890> because<00:02:27.280> I<00:02:27.430> have

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
to cause frizz I know because I have

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.570 
to cause frizz I know because I have
procedure<00:02:28.060> and<00:02:28.330> that<00:02:28.480> always<00:02:28.630> happens<00:02:29.050> so

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
procedure and that always happens so

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.070 
procedure and that always happens so
your<00:02:30.580> hair<00:02:30.790> will<00:02:31.000> not<00:02:31.150> be<00:02:31.330> completely<00:02:31.780> drive

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
your hair will not be completely drive

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.920 
your hair will not be completely drive
from<00:02:32.350> drying<00:02:32.620> it<00:02:32.800> with<00:02:32.890> the<00:02:33.010> fan<00:02:33.220> but<00:02:33.780> it's<00:02:34.780> the

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
from drying it with the fan but it's the

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.180 
from drying it with the fan but it's the
best<00:02:34.959> method<00:02:35.950> that<00:02:36.400> I<00:02:36.670> know<00:02:36.850> to<00:02:37.769> prevent<00:02:38.769> split

best method that I know to prevent split

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.300 
best method that I know to prevent split

ends by using like tons of heat you can

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:48.540 
ends by using like tons of heat you can
