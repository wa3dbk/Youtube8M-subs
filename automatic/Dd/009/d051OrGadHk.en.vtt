what this does is it takes a guest
workout<00:00:08.280> so<00:00:08.940> instead<00:00:09.240> of<00:00:09.300> reading<00:00:09.540> this<00:00:09.929> you

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
workout so instead of reading this you

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.570 
workout so instead of reading this you
just<00:00:10.260> take<00:00:10.469> the<00:00:10.620> rod<00:00:10.800> and<00:00:11.040> you<00:00:11.160> turn<00:00:11.370> it<00:00:11.490> around

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
just take the rod and you turn it around

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.549 
just take the rod and you turn it around
Ted<00:00:12.090> of<00:00:12.179> our<00:00:12.300> code<00:00:12.509> that's<00:00:12.870> a<00:00:12.990> bar<00:00:13.139> code<00:00:13.320> about

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
Ted of our code that's a bar code about

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.289 
Ted of our code that's a bar code about
exactly<00:00:13.950> where<00:00:14.400> what<00:00:14.639> it's<00:00:14.790> doing<00:00:15.030> is<00:00:15.120> it's

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
exactly where what it's doing is it's

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:16.939 
exactly where what it's doing is it's
doing<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.570> same<00:00:15.780> basic<00:00:16.260> performance<00:00:16.440> but

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
doing the same basic performance but

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.349 
doing the same basic performance but
it's<00:00:17.070> giving<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.369> better<00:00:17.460> optics<00:00:17.940> hey<00:00:18.210> what's

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
it's giving a better optics hey what's

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.330 
it's giving a better optics hey what's

the occasional user or somebody wants to
do<00:01:01.920> some<00:01:02.100> just<00:01:02.280> quick<00:01:02.640> elevation<00:01:03.210> shots<00:01:03.480> yep

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
do some just quick elevation shots yep

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.030 
do some just quick elevation shots yep
but<00:01:04.140> they're<00:01:04.290> going<00:01:04.409> to<00:01:04.470> be<00:01:04.619> doing<00:01:04.799> is

but they're going to be doing is

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.830 
but they're going to be doing is
sighting<00:01:05.400> through<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.700> optics<00:01:06.090> here<00:01:06.270> and

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
sighting through the optics here and

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.359 
sighting through the optics here and
they'll<00:01:06.960> sight<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.409> grade<00:01:07.740> staff<00:01:08.100> or<00:01:08.340> a

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
they'll sight to a grade staff or a

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.890 
they'll sight to a grade staff or a
grade<00:01:08.549> rod<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.090> they'll<00:01:09.510> take<00:01:09.720> that

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
grade rod and they'll take that

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.420 
grade rod and they'll take that
elevation<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.650> then<00:01:10.770> they'll<00:01:10.950> transfer<00:01:11.340> that

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
elevation and then they'll transfer that

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.000 
elevation and then they'll transfer that
elevation<00:01:11.820> around<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.570> job<00:01:12.780> site<00:01:13.049> or<00:01:13.560> be<00:01:13.830> able

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
elevation around the job site or be able

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.249 
elevation around the job site or be able
to<00:01:14.100> turn<00:01:14.250> very<00:01:14.549> precise<00:01:14.939> angles<00:01:15.509> okay<00:01:16.020> if<00:01:16.200> you

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
to turn very precise angles okay if you

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.390 
to turn very precise angles okay if you
want<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.500> shoot<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.070> you<00:01:17.130> would<00:01:17.280> think

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
want to shoot and so you would think

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.399 
want to shoot and so you would think
this<00:01:17.549> is<00:01:17.610> good<00:01:17.880> beard<00:01:18.150> landscapers<00:01:18.869> general

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
this is good beard landscapers general

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.109 
this is good beard landscapers general
measurement<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.159> grain<00:01:20.340> absolutely

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
measurement of grain absolutely

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.999 
measurement of grain absolutely
landscapers<00:01:21.930> is<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.080> great<00:01:22.320> opportunity

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
landscapers is a great opportunity

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.100 
landscapers is a great opportunity
maybe<00:01:23.610> house<00:01:23.820> builders<00:01:24.299> some<00:01:24.780> people<00:01:25.020> that

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
maybe house builders some people that

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.080 
maybe house builders some people that
are<00:01:25.200> using<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.619> thing<00:01:25.799> occasionally<00:01:26.400> not<00:01:26.790> all

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
are using the thing occasionally not all

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.490 
are using the thing occasionally not all

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
shots and get a rough idea come up to

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.539 
shots and get a rough idea come up to
this<00:01:30.990> one<00:01:31.200> then<00:01:31.439> yeah<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:31.979> that's<00:01:32.130> gonna<00:01:32.310> take

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
this one then yeah and that's gonna take

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.609 
this one then yeah and that's gonna take
you<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.790> the<00:01:32.880> next<00:01:33.150> level<00:01:33.479> what<00:01:33.840> it's<00:01:34.259> doing<00:01:34.500> is

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
you to the next level what it's doing is

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.410 
you to the next level what it's doing is
its<00:01:34.770> doing<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.070> same<00:01:35.250> basic<00:01:35.729> performance<00:01:35.939> but

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
its doing the same basic performance but

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.850 
its doing the same basic performance but
it's<00:01:36.540> giving<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.840> better<00:01:36.930> optics<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.680> can

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
it's giving a better optics so you can

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.830 
it's giving a better optics so you can
see<00:01:38.070> better<00:01:38.280> you<00:01:38.549> get<00:01:38.790> more<00:01:39.000> light<00:01:39.210> in<00:01:39.450> yeah

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
see better you get more light in yeah

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.030 
see better you get more light in yeah
somebody<00:01:40.200> that's<00:01:40.320> using<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.590> little<00:01:40.710> bit<00:01:40.799> more

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
somebody that's using a little bit more

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.740 
somebody that's using a little bit more
often<00:01:41.250> so<00:01:41.579> like<00:01:41.729> a<00:01:41.759> general<00:01:42.119> contractor

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
often so like a general contractor

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.660 
often so like a general contractor
somebody<00:01:43.110> using<00:01:43.829> it<00:01:43.950> for<00:01:44.220> high-rise

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
somebody using it for high-rise

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.450 
somebody using it for high-rise
buildings<00:01:45.210> for<00:01:45.600> elevations<00:01:46.380> site<00:01:46.979> prep<00:01:47.250> and

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
buildings for elevations site prep and

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.219 
buildings for elevations site prep and
so<00:01:47.610> forth<00:01:47.909> yeah<00:01:48.270> after<00:01:48.750> that

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
so forth yeah after that

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.539 
so forth yeah after that
yep<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.560> got<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.829> big<00:01:49.950> guy<00:01:50.100> right<00:01:50.280> here<00:01:50.369> big

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
yep you got the big guy right here big

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.370 
yep you got the big guy right here big
guy<00:01:50.700> comes<00:01:50.970> in<00:01:51.180> yeah<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.689> big<00:01:51.869> guy<00:01:51.899> what<00:01:52.229> he's

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
guy comes in yeah the big guy what he's

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.679 
guy comes in yeah the big guy what he's
doing<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.950> little<00:01:53.430> bit<00:01:53.579> similar<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.240> this<00:01:54.390> where

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
doing a little bit similar to this where

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.420 
doing a little bit similar to this where
your<00:01:54.869> sighting<00:01:55.590> through<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:55.950> you're<00:01:56.070> taking

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
your sighting through and you're taking

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.459 
your sighting through and you're taking
a<00:01:56.520> reading<00:01:56.729> like<00:01:57.090> these<00:01:57.329> are<00:01:57.570> but<00:01:58.200> where<00:01:58.380> it

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
a reading like these are but where it

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.959 
a reading like these are but where it
really<00:01:58.530> makes<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.950> big<00:01:58.979> difference<00:01:59.520> is<00:01:59.729> where

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
really makes a big difference is where

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.670 
really makes a big difference is where
these<00:02:00.119> you've<00:02:00.420> got<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.600> person<00:02:00.960> behind<00:02:01.290> here<00:02:01.530> a

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
these you've got a person behind here a

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.219 
these you've got a person behind here a
person<00:02:01.950> behind<00:02:02.369> here<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:02.850> then<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.780> person

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
person behind here and then the person

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.499 
person behind here and then the person
reading<00:02:04.590> it<00:02:04.860> has<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.250> decipher<00:02:05.880> what<00:02:06.119> number

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
reading it has to decipher what number

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:07.880 
reading it has to decipher what number
is<00:02:06.600> that<00:02:06.630> they're<00:02:06.930> actually<00:02:07.079> reading<00:02:07.560> right

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
is that they're actually reading right

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.190 
is that they're actually reading right
and<00:02:08.039> that<00:02:08.129> opens<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.580> door<00:02:08.789> for<00:02:09.200> transposing

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
and that opens the door for transposing

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.020 
and that opens the door for transposing
that<00:02:10.349> number<00:02:10.709> was<00:02:10.890> at<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.069> four<00:02:11.310> point<00:02:11.610> one<00:02:11.790> six

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
that number was at a four point one six

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.800 
that number was at a four point one six
five<00:02:12.330> or<00:02:12.599> four<00:02:12.840> point<00:02:13.110> six<00:02:13.319> one

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
five or four point six one

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.180 
five or four point six one
five<00:02:13.959> right<00:02:14.290> and<00:02:14.470> then<00:02:14.620> they<00:02:14.739> write<00:02:14.920> it<00:02:15.069> down

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
five right and then they write it down

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.190 
five right and then they write it down
they<00:02:15.400> write<00:02:15.580> it<00:02:15.700> down<00:02:15.849> wrong<00:02:16.150> they<00:02:16.840> forget

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
they write it down wrong they forget

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.960 
they write it down wrong they forget
they<00:02:17.349> look<00:02:17.560> through<00:02:17.709> again<00:02:18.069> to<00:02:18.550> get<00:02:18.700> it<00:02:18.819> all

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
they look through again to get it all

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.580 
they look through again to get it all
set<00:02:19.209> what<00:02:19.720> this<00:02:19.870> does<00:02:20.050> is<00:02:20.200> it<00:02:20.319> takes<00:02:20.410> a

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
set what this does is it takes a

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.830 
set what this does is it takes a
guesswork<00:02:20.980> out<00:02:21.220> so<00:02:21.910> instead<00:02:22.209> of<00:02:22.270> reading<00:02:22.569> this

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
guesswork out so instead of reading this

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.449 
guesswork out so instead of reading this
you<00:02:23.110> just<00:02:23.230> take<00:02:23.410> the<00:02:23.590> rod<00:02:23.770> and<00:02:24.040> you<00:02:24.130> turn<00:02:24.340> it

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
you just take the rod and you turn it

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:24.870 
you just take the rod and you turn it
around

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
around

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.280 
around
instead<00:02:25.060> of<00:02:25.150> our<00:02:25.270> code<00:02:25.480> that's<00:02:25.840> a<00:02:25.959> bar<00:02:26.110> code

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
instead of our code that's a bar code

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.470 
instead of our code that's a bar code
right<00:02:26.530> exactly<00:02:27.130> and<00:02:27.819> what<00:02:28.000> it's<00:02:28.150> going<00:02:28.239> to<00:02:28.300> do

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
right exactly and what it's going to do

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.600 
right exactly and what it's going to do
then<00:02:28.720> in<00:02:28.930> essence<00:02:29.590> it<00:02:29.709> takes<00:02:29.920> a<00:02:30.069> picture<00:02:30.400> of

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
then in essence it takes a picture of

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.460 
then in essence it takes a picture of
this<00:02:30.760> bar<00:02:31.000> code<00:02:31.269> and<00:02:31.510> it<00:02:31.930> gives<00:02:32.170> you<00:02:32.349> the

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
this bar code and it gives you the

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.320 
this bar code and it gives you the
elevation<00:02:33.069> that's<00:02:33.220> on<00:02:33.489> the<00:02:33.640> backside<00:02:34.120> of<00:02:34.150> it

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
elevation that's on the backside of it

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:36.030 
elevation that's on the backside of it
there<00:02:34.599> right<00:02:34.900> and<00:02:35.140> it<00:02:35.380> transfers<00:02:35.830> it

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
there right and it transfers it

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.710 
there right and it transfers it
digitally<00:02:36.640> right<00:02:37.000> on<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.239> screen<00:02:37.480> on<00:02:37.660> the

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
digitally right on the screen on the

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.240 
digitally right on the screen on the
back<00:02:37.870> here<00:02:38.110> so<00:02:38.230> you<00:02:38.290> can<00:02:38.500> see<00:02:38.650> exactly<00:02:38.980> what

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
back here so you can see exactly what

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.280 
back here so you can see exactly what
that<00:02:39.310> elevation<00:02:39.970> is<00:02:40.120> four<00:02:40.599> point<00:02:40.870> one<00:02:41.050> six

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
that elevation is four point one six

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.080 
that elevation is four point one six
five<00:02:41.530> you<00:02:42.099> go<00:02:42.220> to<00:02:42.280> write<00:02:42.519> it<00:02:42.640> in<00:02:42.760> your<00:02:42.880> fuel

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
five you go to write it in your fuel

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.280 
five you go to write it in your fuel
book<00:02:43.300> you<00:02:43.450> look<00:02:43.630> at<00:02:43.780> it<00:02:43.900> again

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
book you look at it again

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.660 
book you look at it again
there's<00:02:44.500> no<00:02:44.709> second<00:02:45.160> guessing<00:02:45.250> no

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
there's no second guessing no

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.759 
there's no second guessing no
transposition<00:02:46.420> so<00:02:47.110> it<00:02:47.200> eliminates<00:02:47.350> that

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
transposition so it eliminates that

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.979 
transposition so it eliminates that
human<00:02:48.130> error<00:02:48.310> plus<00:02:48.970> it's<00:02:49.540> going<00:02:49.690> to<00:02:49.780> give<00:02:49.930> you

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
human error plus it's going to give you

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.710 
human error plus it's going to give you
the<00:02:50.110> distance<00:02:50.530> from<00:02:50.950> here<00:02:51.250> to<00:02:51.310> here<00:02:52.030> so<00:02:52.600> it's

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
the distance from here to here so it's

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.210 
the distance from here to here so it's
an<00:02:52.840> added<00:02:53.080> bonus<00:02:53.380> to<00:02:53.410> have<00:02:53.620> that<00:02:53.739> distance<00:02:53.920> in

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
an added bonus to have that distance in

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:55.890 
an added bonus to have that distance in
there<00:02:54.370> okay<00:02:54.610> let's<00:02:55.030> go<00:02:55.150> shopping<00:02:55.569> let's<00:02:55.720> get
