00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
measurements I need the measurements for

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.060 
measurements I need the measurements for
the<00:00:34.239> front<00:00:34.570> I'll<00:00:35.260> need<00:00:35.500> the<00:00:35.620> measurements

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
the front I'll need the measurements

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.240 
the front I'll need the measurements
from<00:00:36.250> the<00:00:36.400> sides<00:00:36.670> the<00:00:37.360> back<00:00:37.659> and<00:00:37.989> the<00:00:38.260> top<00:00:38.530> we

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
from the sides the back and the top we

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.950 
from the sides the back and the top we
also<00:00:39.280> have<00:00:39.699> some<00:00:39.879> photos<00:00:40.180> online<00:00:40.360> so<00:00:40.720> you<00:00:40.809> can

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:48.689 
this this is the one you like this is a
good<00:00:46.720> picture<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:48.190> then<00:00:48.400> here's<00:00:48.640> the

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:48.699 
good picture and then here's the

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:50.160 
good picture and then here's the
measurements<00:00:49.180> that<00:00:49.210> we<00:00:49.299> just<00:00:49.540> write<00:00:49.690> down<00:00:49.720> and

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
measurements that we just write down and

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.609 
measurements that we just write down and
I<00:00:50.260> go<00:00:50.470> and<00:00:50.739> I<00:00:50.860> cut<00:00:51.100> accordingly<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:53.140> this<00:00:53.379> base

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:53.619 
I go and I cut accordingly so this base

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:55.229 
I go and I cut accordingly so this base
is<00:00:54.010> the<00:00:54.220> m112

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
is the m112

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:58.500 
is the m112
and<00:00:56.430> you'll<00:00:57.430> find<00:00:57.699> that<00:00:57.820> it<00:00:58.000> will<00:00:58.150> come<00:00:58.360> in

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
and you'll find that it will come in

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.390 
and you'll find that it will come in
curly<00:00:58.839> packs<00:00:59.170> like<00:00:59.440> this<00:01:02.040> as<00:01:03.040> you<00:01:03.100> can<00:01:03.250> see

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:03.400 
curly packs like this as you can see

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.450 
curly packs like this as you can see
it's<00:01:03.939> got<00:01:04.150> a<00:01:04.180> nice<00:01:04.510> strong<00:01:05.110> base<00:01:05.590> here<00:01:06.010> so<00:01:06.040> for

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
it's got a nice strong base here so for

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.500 
it's got a nice strong base here so for
these<00:01:06.520> guys<00:01:06.760> that<00:01:06.970> are<00:01:07.090> looking<00:01:07.210> for

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
these guys that are looking for

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.270 
these guys that are looking for
something<00:01:07.690> that's<00:01:07.810> a<00:01:08.080> lot<00:01:08.260> more<00:01:08.470> durable<00:01:08.950> for

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:09.280 
something that's a lot more durable for

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.130 
something that's a lot more durable for
you<00:01:09.400> this<00:01:09.970> would<00:01:10.120> be<00:01:10.240> the<00:01:10.360> base<00:01:10.510> one<00:01:10.990> of<00:01:11.080> the

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
you this would be the base one of the

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.390 
you this would be the base one of the
bases<00:01:11.440> that<00:01:11.470> you<00:01:11.590> could<00:01:11.860> choose

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400

and inches we really appreciate it and I
will<00:01:28.490> start<00:01:28.880> from<00:01:29.000> the<00:01:29.150> back<00:01:29.650> and<00:01:30.650> this<00:01:31.070> one

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
will start from the back and this one

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.580 
will start from the back and this one
here<00:01:31.490> in<00:01:31.640> the<00:01:31.730> back<00:01:31.940> is<00:01:32.270> three<00:01:32.570> inches<00:01:32.990> so<00:01:35.590> I

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
here in the back is three inches so I

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.520 
here in the back is three inches so I
will<00:01:36.860> measure<00:01:37.040> it<00:01:37.930> three<00:01:38.930> inches<00:01:39.200> which<00:01:39.410> is

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
will measure it three inches which is

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.850 
will measure it three inches which is
about<00:01:39.770> here<00:01:40.130> now<00:01:40.880> I<00:01:41.230> always<00:01:42.230> make<00:01:42.500> this<00:01:42.680> a

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:42.860 
about here now I always make this a

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.440 
about here now I always make this a
little<00:01:43.220> bit<00:01:43.490> longer<00:01:43.760> than<00:01:43.970> what<00:01:44.150> you<00:01:44.240> asked

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
little bit longer than what you asked

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.230 
little bit longer than what you asked
for<00:01:44.740> only<00:01:45.740> reason<00:01:46.220> being<00:01:46.370> is<00:01:46.580> because<00:01:46.730> a<00:01:46.910> lot

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
for only reason being is because a lot

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.760 
for only reason being is because a lot
of<00:01:47.270> times<00:01:47.600> in<00:01:47.750> here<00:01:47.870> shrinks<00:01:48.320> up<00:01:48.440> when<00:01:48.650> it

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
of times in here shrinks up when it

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.230 
of times in here shrinks up when it
dries<00:01:49.010> and<00:01:49.310> when<00:01:49.460> it's<00:01:49.580> wet<00:01:49.790> because<00:01:49.940> we're

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
dries and when it's wet because we're

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.050 
dries and when it's wet because we're
pulling<00:01:50.510> on<00:01:50.630> it<00:01:50.660> so<00:01:50.990> much<00:01:51.640> so<00:01:52.640> you'll<00:01:52.790> find

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:53.060 
pulling on it so much so you'll find

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.160 
pulling on it so much so you'll find
that<00:01:53.180> it<00:01:53.300> might<00:01:53.450> be<00:01:53.570> a<00:01:53.600> little<00:01:53.750> bit<00:01:53.990> longer

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
that it might be a little bit longer

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.260 
that it might be a little bit longer
than<00:01:54.350> you<00:01:54.470> asked<00:01:54.620> for<00:01:54.890> it's<00:01:55.130> better<00:01:55.730> to<00:01:55.940> err<00:01:56.090> on

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
than you asked for it's better to err on

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.850 
than you asked for it's better to err on
that<00:01:56.420> side<00:01:56.660> than<00:01:56.900> to<00:01:56.930> err<00:01:57.140> on<00:01:57.170> it<00:01:57.410> being<00:01:57.590> too

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
that side than to err on it being too

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.770 
that side than to err on it being too
short<00:01:58.100> because<00:01:58.310> I<00:01:58.490> can't<00:01:58.730> fix<00:01:58.970> too<00:01:59.270> short<00:02:01.780> so

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
short because I can't fix too short so

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.990 
short because I can't fix too short so
and<00:02:03.080> I<00:02:03.170> cut<00:02:03.380> my<00:02:03.410> hair<00:02:03.740> always<00:02:04.490> cut<00:02:04.700> it<00:02:04.820> with<00:02:04.940> a

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
and I cut my hair always cut it with a

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.410 
and I cut my hair always cut it with a
razor

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
razor

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.910 
razor
well<00:02:05.630> I<00:02:05.660> always<00:02:05.960> cut<00:02:06.230> it<00:02:06.320> with<00:02:06.410> a<00:02:06.440> razor<00:02:06.590> around

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
well I always cut it with a razor around

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.470 
well I always cut it with a razor around
the<00:02:07.010> perimeter<00:02:07.430> area<00:02:07.760> so<00:02:07.940> it<00:02:08.060> has<00:02:08.210> a<00:02:08.240> nice

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:08.480 
the perimeter area so it has a nice

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.900 
the perimeter area so it has a nice
blend<00:02:08.780> for<00:02:09.140> you<00:02:09.260> I<00:02:09.440> get<00:02:09.950> a<00:02:09.980> lot<00:02:10.220> of<00:02:10.340> super<00:02:10.730> nice

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
blend for you I get a lot of super nice

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.420 
blend for you I get a lot of super nice
layers<00:02:11.210> in<00:02:11.540> this<00:02:11.720> as<00:02:11.900> well<00:02:12.110> and<00:02:12.350> it<00:02:12.950> has<00:02:12.980> a<00:02:13.100> nice

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
layers in this as well and it has a nice

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.820 
layers in this as well and it has a nice
movement<00:02:13.940> so<00:02:14.690> if<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:14.930> wind<00:02:15.170> blows<00:02:15.380> it<00:02:15.710> will

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
movement so if the wind blows it will

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.470 
movement so if the wind blows it will
move<00:02:15.980> nice<00:02:16.280> little<00:02:16.700> fall<00:02:16.910> back<00:02:17.150> into<00:02:17.390> place

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
move nice little fall back into place

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.630 
move nice little fall back into place
for<00:02:18.050> you<00:02:18.200> you<00:02:18.650> won't<00:02:18.770> have<00:02:18.950> any<00:02:19.160> issues<00:02:19.400> with

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
for you you won't have any issues with

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:25.210 
for you you won't have any issues with
it<00:02:23.020> okay<00:02:24.020> so<00:02:24.080> now<00:02:24.350> that<00:02:24.410> we've<00:02:24.650> cut<00:02:24.830> the<00:02:24.980> sides

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
it okay so now that we've cut the sides

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.979 
it okay so now that we've cut the sides
and<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:25.970> front<00:02:26.000> and<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:26.480> back<00:02:26.630> we're<00:02:26.900> going

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
and the front and the back we're going

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.960 
and the front and the back we're going
to<00:02:27.050> cut<00:02:27.230> the<00:02:27.350> top<00:02:27.620> so<00:02:28.400> I'm<00:02:28.520> going<00:02:28.670> to<00:02:28.730> make<00:02:28.850> the

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
to cut the top so I'm going to make the

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.699 
to cut the top so I'm going to make the
top<00:02:29.209> they<00:02:29.450> wanted<00:02:29.780> to<00:02:29.870> talk<00:02:30.050> to<00:02:30.260> be<00:02:30.380> around

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
top they wanted to talk to be around

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.560 
top they wanted to talk to be around
approximately<00:02:31.040> four<00:02:31.730> inches<00:02:32.090> so<00:02:32.150> I'm<00:02:32.420> going

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
approximately four inches so I'm going

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.710 
approximately four inches so I'm going
to<00:02:32.660> do<00:02:32.780> that<00:02:32.989> for<00:02:33.260> them<00:02:33.410> too<00:02:34.270> so<00:02:35.270> this<00:02:35.420> way<00:02:35.570> they

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
to do that for them too so this way they

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.030 
to do that for them too so this way they
won't<00:02:35.810> have<00:02:35.900> any<00:02:36.260> problems<00:02:36.830> when<00:02:36.920> they're

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
won't have any problems when they're

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.090 
won't have any problems when they're
styling<00:02:37.310> it<00:02:38.440> so<00:02:39.440> we<00:02:39.560> always<00:02:39.770> measure

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
styling it so we always measure

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.770 
styling it so we always measure
everything<00:02:40.580> a<00:02:40.640> few<00:02:40.850> times<00:02:41.120> before<00:02:41.300> we<00:02:41.630> even

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
everything a few times before we even

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.900 
everything a few times before we even
cut<00:02:42.050> so<00:02:42.350> they<00:02:42.980> measured<00:02:43.310> a<00:02:43.370> couple<00:02:43.640> of<00:02:43.700> times

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
cut so they measured a couple of times

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:58.540 
cut so they measured a couple of times
already<00:02:44.239> so<00:02:44.390> we're<00:02:44.690> all<00:02:44.780> set

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.100 

you're<00:02:59.120> always<00:02:59.210> asking<00:02:59.450> now<00:02:59.750> how<00:02:59.870> does<00:02:59.930> this

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
you're always asking now how does this

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.070 
you're always asking now how does this
manage<00:03:00.470> how<00:03:00.620> you<00:03:00.680> get<00:03:00.860> this<00:03:00.980> to<00:03:01.130> blend<00:03:01.370> in<00:03:01.580> well

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
manage how you get this to blend in well

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.720 
manage how you get this to blend in well
the<00:03:03.080> reason<00:03:03.470> why<00:03:03.560> it<00:03:03.620> blends<00:03:03.920> in<00:03:04.100> so<00:03:04.280> nicely<00:03:04.640> to

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
the reason why it blends in so nicely to

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.400 
the reason why it blends in so nicely to
people's<00:03:05.030> hair<00:03:05.210> is<00:03:05.390> because<00:03:05.870> we<00:03:05.990> use<00:03:06.110> a<00:03:06.140> razor

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
people's hair is because we use a razor

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:07.870 
people's hair is because we use a razor
on<00:03:06.680> the<00:03:06.800> edges<00:03:07.130> and<00:03:07.280> then<00:03:07.370> this<00:03:07.520> way<00:03:07.610> you<00:03:07.670> don't

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
on the edges and then this way you don't

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.820 
on the edges and then this way you don't
get<00:03:07.940> that<00:03:08.090> straight<00:03:08.480> line<00:03:08.660> you'll<00:03:09.260> never<00:03:09.530> find

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830 
get that straight line you'll never find

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:10.960 
get that straight line you'll never find
that<00:03:09.950> any<00:03:10.190> of<00:03:10.310> our<00:03:10.430> cuts<00:03:10.670> will<00:03:10.820> have<00:03:10.910> a

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
that any of our cuts will have a

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.550 
that any of our cuts will have a
straight<00:03:11.330> line<00:03:11.360> across<00:03:11.690> the<00:03:12.020> sides<00:03:12.260> in<00:03:12.470> the

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
straight line across the sides in the

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.040 
straight line across the sides in the
back<00:03:12.880> all<00:03:13.880> those<00:03:14.090> blending<00:03:14.510> areas<00:03:14.810> will<00:03:15.020> have

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050 
back all those blending areas will have

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.720 
back all those blending areas will have
like<00:03:15.410> a<00:03:15.440> razor<00:03:15.740> cut<00:03:16.010> which<00:03:16.160> will<00:03:16.280> be<00:03:16.400> kind<00:03:16.610> of

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
like a razor cut which will be kind of

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.090 
like a razor cut which will be kind of
zig<00:03:16.910> zaggy<00:03:17.150> which<00:03:17.510> is<00:03:18.380> what<00:03:18.620> gives<00:03:18.860> you<00:03:18.950> that

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
zig zaggy which is what gives you that

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.810 
zig zaggy which is what gives you that
nice<00:03:19.280> blending<00:03:19.850> line<00:03:20.590> high<00:03:21.590> so<00:03:21.890> we<00:03:22.190> finish

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
nice blending line high so we finish

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.250 
nice blending line high so we finish
doing<00:03:23.000> the<00:03:23.120> cut<00:03:23.300> on<00:03:23.420> this<00:03:23.600> I'm<00:03:23.750> just<00:03:23.870> running

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
doing the cut on this I'm just running

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.960 
doing the cut on this I'm just running
through<00:03:24.470> it<00:03:24.560> now<00:03:24.740> quickly<00:03:25.040> and<00:03:25.400> just<00:03:25.580> kind<00:03:25.850> of

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
through it now quickly and just kind of

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.000 
through it now quickly and just kind of
putting<00:03:26.240> it<00:03:26.450> out<00:03:26.570> here<00:03:26.840> and<00:03:26.960> there<00:03:27.170> wherever<00:03:27.830> I

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
putting it out here and there wherever I

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.910 
putting it out here and there wherever I
see<00:03:28.340> it<00:03:28.460> so<00:03:28.610> it<00:03:28.760> has<00:03:28.910> a<00:03:28.940> natural<00:03:29.480> appearance<00:03:29.920> a

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
see it so it has a natural appearance a

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.830 
see it so it has a natural appearance a
lot<00:03:31.550> of<00:03:31.670> times<00:03:31.850> you<00:03:32.030> won't<00:03:32.150> find<00:03:32.450> that<00:03:32.690> they're

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
lot of times you won't find that they're

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.330 
lot of times you won't find that they're
going<00:03:32.990> to<00:03:33.080> be<00:03:33.200> a<00:03:33.230> little<00:03:33.530> bit<00:03:33.680> thick<00:03:33.920> they<00:03:34.130> do

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
going to be a little bit thick they do

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.490 
going to be a little bit thick they do
that<00:03:34.580> up<00:03:34.760> time<00:03:35.120> on<00:03:35.330> the<00:03:35.420> roll<00:03:35.630> but<00:03:36.200> you<00:03:36.260> also

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
that up time on the roll but you also

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.930 
that up time on the roll but you also
need<00:03:36.770> to<00:03:36.920> think<00:03:37.130> about<00:03:37.250> a<00:03:37.370> little<00:03:37.610> bit<00:03:37.790> with

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
need to think about a little bit with

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.450 
need to think about a little bit with
the<00:03:38.030> thinning<00:03:38.330> shears<00:03:38.600> so<00:03:39.530> this<00:03:40.130> is<00:03:40.280> pretty

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:40.460 
the thinning shears so this is pretty

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.810 
the thinning shears so this is pretty
much<00:03:40.550> what<00:03:40.850> we<00:03:40.880> do<00:03:42.400> we're<00:03:43.400> just<00:03:43.550> kind<00:03:43.760> of

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
much what we do we're just kind of

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.710 
much what we do we're just kind of
thinning<00:03:44.120> it<00:03:44.240> out<00:03:44.360> a<00:03:44.390> bit<00:03:46.180> and<00:03:47.180> then<00:03:47.360> I<00:03:47.450> always

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
thinning it out a bit and then I always

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.420 
thinning it out a bit and then I always
brush<00:03:47.900> it<00:03:48.080> a<00:03:48.140> little<00:03:48.320> bit<00:03:48.470> just<00:03:48.620> to<00:03:48.770> see<00:03:48.800> you

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
brush it a little bit just to see you

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:50.800 
brush it a little bit just to see you
