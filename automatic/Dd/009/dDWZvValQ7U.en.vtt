00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
was recently suggested to me and I did

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.210 
was recently suggested to me and I did
try<00:03:49.540> that<00:03:49.810> today<00:03:50.049> and<00:03:50.320> I<00:03:50.470> have<00:03:50.650> to<00:03:50.680> say<00:03:51.010> that<00:03:51.190> I

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
am liking it I think the consistency

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.240 
am liking it I think the consistency
really<00:03:55.000> lends<00:03:55.360> itself<00:03:55.570> well<00:03:56.080> as<00:03:56.500> a<00:03:56.680> base<00:03:56.920> it

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
really lends itself well as a base it

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.370 
really lends itself well as a base it
leaves<00:03:57.580> me<00:03:57.820> that<00:03:58.000> very<00:03:58.330> familiar<00:03:58.959> tacky

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.240 
leaves me that very familiar tacky
feeling<00:03:59.830> that<00:04:00.610> a<00:04:00.970> lot<00:04:01.150> of<00:04:01.950> silicone<00:04:02.950> based

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
feeling that a lot of silicone based

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.670 
feeling that a lot of silicone based
products<00:04:03.880> have<00:04:04.120> but<00:04:04.450> what<00:04:04.840> I<00:04:04.870> like<00:04:05.140> about<00:04:05.320> this

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
medium to fall the consistency I would

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.930 
medium to fall the consistency I would
have<00:04:34.150> to<00:04:34.330> say<00:04:34.510> is<00:04:34.690> very<00:04:35.050> very<00:04:35.440> lightweight

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
have to say is very very lightweight

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.300 
have to say is very very lightweight
very<00:04:36.960> comfortable<00:04:37.960> on<00:04:38.110> the<00:04:38.229> skin<00:04:38.590> almost<00:04:38.979> even

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
very comfortable on the skin almost even

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.880 
very comfortable on the skin almost even
feels<00:04:39.760> lighter<00:04:40.150> than<00:04:40.479> a<00:04:40.630> few<00:04:41.169> of<00:04:41.290> the<00:04:41.410> tendon

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890

moisturizers<00:04:42.729> or

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
moisturizers or

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.410 
moisturizers or
your<00:04:43.530> CC<00:04:43.980> creams<00:04:44.280> that<00:04:44.370> I've<00:04:44.700> been<00:04:44.910> using<00:04:45.090> as

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:45.420 
your CC creams that I've been using as

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.450 
your CC creams that I've been using as
of<00:04:45.630> late<00:04:45.840> and<00:04:46.020> for<00:04:46.560> the<00:04:46.650> coverage<00:04:47.100> that<00:04:47.130> it

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
of late and for the coverage that it

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.330 
of late and for the coverage that it
gives<00:04:47.730> I<00:04:47.970> think<00:04:48.240> absolutely<00:04:49.070> amazing<00:04:50.070> the<00:04:50.910> the

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340 
gives I think absolutely amazing the the

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.650 
gives I think absolutely amazing the the
concealer<00:04:53.340> comes<00:04:53.700> but<00:04:53.970> for<00:04:54.210> me<00:04:54.330> unfortunately

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
concealer comes but for me unfortunately

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.290 
concealer comes but for me unfortunately
doesn't<00:04:55.380> I<00:04:55.740> haven't<00:04:56.520> really<00:04:56.730> used<00:04:56.760> it<00:04:56.970> much

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
doesn't I haven't really used it much

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.570 
doesn't I haven't really used it much
because<00:04:57.540> it<00:04:57.840> really<00:04:58.320> does<00:04:58.530> not<00:04:58.800> do<00:04:59.160> much<00:04:59.340> in

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
because it really does not do much in

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:00.710 
because it really does not do much in
terms<00:04:59.820> of<00:05:00.000> coverage

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
terms of coverage

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.780 
terms of coverage
I<00:05:00.750> think<00:05:01.350> the<00:05:01.470> liquid<00:05:01.920> foundation<00:05:02.520> if<00:05:02.640> it

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
I think the liquid foundation if it

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.420 
I think the liquid foundation if it
actually<00:05:03.000> does<00:05:03.390> smart<00:05:03.720> and<00:05:03.960> it's<00:05:04.680> very<00:05:04.950> sheer

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:05.430 
actually does smart and it's very sheer

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:08.810 
actually does smart and it's very sheer
as<00:05:06.120> a<00:05:06.180> concealer<00:05:06.900> for<00:05:07.110> me<00:05:07.230> I<00:05:07.260> find<00:05:07.620> that<00:05:07.820> it

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 
as a concealer for me I find that it

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.170 
as a concealer for me I find that it
doesn't<00:05:09.660> really<00:05:09.810> do<00:05:10.650> much<00:05:10.830> coverage<00:05:11.430> but

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180 
doesn't really do much coverage but

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.720 
doesn't really do much coverage but
essentially<00:05:13.140> I've<00:05:13.380> been<00:05:13.650> hurt<00:05:13.950> very<00:05:14.190> happy

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:14.730 
essentially I've been hurt very happy

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:19.790 
essentially I've been hurt very happy
with<00:05:14.910> both<00:05:15.150> I<00:05:15.450> think<00:05:16.790> they<00:05:17.790> are<00:05:18.380> Holy<00:05:19.380> Grail

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
with both I think they are Holy Grail

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.880 
with both I think they are Holy Grail
products<00:05:20.520> and<00:05:20.730> worth<00:05:21.540> doing<00:05:22.050> a<00:05:22.230> full<00:05:22.470> review

after this I will be attaching a video
clip<00:05:37.410> of<00:05:37.620> me<00:05:38.070> just<00:05:38.340> having<00:05:38.760> the<00:05:39.240> two<00:05:39.480> products

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
clip of me just having the two products

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:42.380 
clip of me just having the two products
on<00:05:40.080> the<00:05:40.350> skin<00:05:40.740> with<00:05:41.430> nothing<00:05:41.850> else<00:05:41.940> without

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:42.390 
on the skin with nothing else without

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.440 
on the skin with nothing else without
setting<00:05:42.840> it<00:05:42.960> with<00:05:43.140> any<00:05:43.290> powder<00:05:43.650> in<00:05:43.950> any<00:05:44.160> other

setting it with any powder in any other
complexion<00:05:45.450> products<00:05:46.050> so<00:05:46.200> I<00:05:46.700> guess<00:05:47.700> it's
