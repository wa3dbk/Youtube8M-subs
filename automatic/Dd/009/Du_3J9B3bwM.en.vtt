00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.900
 hello my friends residents my name is 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.310
 leandro light I am manager 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.900
 technical assistance blow 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:22.730
 growth shown to our market. 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.080
 new aluminum line that we already 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.390
 we spoke previously you already know 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:30.140
 but it is important to highlight our product 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.939
 also our special l 615 net that 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.670
 equipped the citroen engines and kissed the 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:36.649
 point 4 is this product originally 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.190
 elect in thermoplastic is boarding 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:41.989
 elite and we follow and in the course of 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.840
 of the use of this product many times 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.520
 there is an excess of torque there may be a 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.350
 better say there is an excess of touch 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.360
 it may be that the system has a bit of 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.130
 over pressure is that sometimes it ends up 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.110
 leaking or having any other type of 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.510
 problem then we develop 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.540
 an exclusive part for the customer a 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.540
 aluminum part is completely 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:04.369
 resistant to the application of this product 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.649
 exactly as thermoplastic or 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:09.799
 whether you have to use a 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:11.930
 extreme quality when play indicates 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.189
 touch shop products that the product of 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.060
 extreme quality we know 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:16.880
 quite ne 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.380
 only he has one detail is all he 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.479
 has the healing time so we ask 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.560
 so that if you will use it because 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.539
 product ne 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.210
 the ptax dollar better saying you have to 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:29.869
 wait for the healing time of the 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:32.420
 product are you applying the adhesive standby 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:35.049
 five to ten minutes and see if your 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:38.270
 is cured to the touch, ie you 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:41.030
 There you go and see if she is not there. 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:45.340
 sticky after that you'll apply on 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:48.229
 by placing all the screws 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.779
 generally in a spiral position and 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.420
 are eight fastening screws and wait 

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:55.100
 the person because what happens many 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.289
 the big problem and not wait for the 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.789
 adhesive cure time every 3 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:00.799
 millimeters of sealing between 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.509
 surfaces on which to wait 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:05.060
 This talking to the laptop has to 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:07.849
 wait at least 24 hours 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.190
 ok ie you applied after application 

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:13.010
 to wait 24 hours so you have 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.599
 a perfect seal there in the case a 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.290
 surface clearance of up to three 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:17.360
 minutes 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.490
 logically if you have a 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.410
 there a point of corrosion 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.730
 thing a little deeper you go 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.040
 have to wait a little longer 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.380
 You're going to have to wait 48 hours until 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.960
 the full curriculum sticker 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.240
 paying attention in the aftermath of 0.8 thousand 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.820
 kilometers up to maximum ilo maximum 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.930
 the staff and wait for the healing time 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.660
 and then you will not have any problem 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.640
 leaking out of that engine even if 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.680
 you have a little excess pressure from the 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:47.330
 system is an important part of 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:49.010
 observed is the head surface without 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.120
 irregularities right 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.290
 and if there is any kind of 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:56.210
 irregularity is between the surface 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.820
 housing in the value of housing case is 

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.590
 nostalgic is the head, and lend 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.290
 much attention because in the future after the 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.810
 there may be a leak 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.670
 is due to this regularity in the 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.830
 It's always good to clean the 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.880
 surface 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:16.760
 reinforcing applying the adhesive to the carcass 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:19.580
 wait for your healing time to touch 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:23.080
 after these five ten minutes 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:25.940
 apply the part to the head 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:29.270
 we put the screws and 6 years the 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:32.180
 snail-shaped squeeze and 0.8 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:34.850
 nilton meters up to a maximum of 1 kilo 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:38.570
 so obviously waiting 24 hours the 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:41.990
 cure time or if the clearance between the 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:43.970
 the prefix of the source has been 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:46.010
 longer to wait a little longer than 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.510
 healing of the repairers 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.520
 I hope you have enjoyed the 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.260
