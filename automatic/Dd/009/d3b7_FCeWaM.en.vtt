00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.900
 they me feeling billion in 1000 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:12.750

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.720
 used to have hit with heaven 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:49.860
 that the problem 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:53.490

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.940
 that my fault club sac is dirty 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.880
 I'm sorry for something better deserved 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:03.530
 so probably would have worked so well 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:07.759
 no matter here psycho kinesis should believe 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:10.830

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:13.050

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:19.530
 onyx comes in there we grow again 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:23.750
 too lax and in my goulash 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.750
 never really comes in steyr somehow 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:32.730
 davoser wanted to keep out saying 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:36.900
 onyx but no idea but only 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.930
 shit i think my only to be you 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.150
 is one of the weakest papers 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:46.920
 least one is the weakest of the top 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:50.580
 4 takes place at bruno I do not care 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.760

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:56.970

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.910
 Ford dad even if you do not send 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:07.370
 each each but most water pumps 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:09.630
 into the team or networked and just 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.050
 water pumps us already half the rent 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.030
 went 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:18.910
 Green here too though fighting groups 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:21.910
 but wow wow it's true true 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:25.420
 it is very effective because you have completely 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.220
 forget completely forgetting that 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:31.780
 pink nature open 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:34.690
 it's my dear hollywood too 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:39.190
 not so bad in the design plan should 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:42.070
 hope that a maximum of 27 already comes 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:45.420

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:48.280

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.410
 why use this one here 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.230
 a little wolf can use it too 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:57.220
 without risking that great 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:04:01.570
 For example, you lose against Bruno 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:04.510
 sounds a little bit of a lot of effort yes 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.590
 okay now temple has been defeated 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.460

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:13.030

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:15.040

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.530

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.220

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:30.250
 mega click on was very close but he 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.530

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.980
 This thunder flashes off to the clique 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.980
 defeat 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:42.310
 or that amazed indeed 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:45.970
 bit should bleed bigger 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:48.130
 pose as I thought we did 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.990

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:53.610

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:57.789

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:59.770
 What that should not be a clue to anyone 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:00.780
 case should be the half hopes 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:04.030
 pull it off 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.690
 megacad we hold out yes ok iv hits 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.080
 not normal 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:10.449
 from that also no problem and that 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.300
 will probably be the shortest doll 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:15.760
 Sheet does not bring the duration 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:21.220
 56 minutes 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:22.419
 we control I'm done yet 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.050

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:33.070
