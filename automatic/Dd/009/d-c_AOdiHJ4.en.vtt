00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.260
 the viruses are too small to 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.719
 can be seen with a microscope 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:15.530
 optical and can not be grown outside of 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:18.320
 your guests 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:21.020
 consequently diseases continue 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.730
 viruses are not novel viruses themselves 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:27.500
 they could not be studied until the century 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:29.360
 20 in 1886 the great adult chemist 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.390
 older showed that the disease of 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.780
 mosaic of tobacco and emt was transmitted 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:39.710
 from a diseased plant to a healthy plant 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:42.050
 in 1892 Russian bacteriologists dmitri and 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.449
 vain that tried to isolate the cause of the 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.699
 disease and for it leaked the sap 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:48.710
 of diseased plants through a 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:51.769
 porcelain filter designed for 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.510
 retain bacteria his desire was to find the 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:55.309
 microorganism trapped in the filter 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.649
 but actually discovered that the agent 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:00.230
 infectious had crossed the 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:02.329
 tiny pores of the filter when we were going 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.570
 which infected healthy plants with the liquid 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:07.370
 filtered this contraction emits the 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.560
 first human disease associated with 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.010
 an infiltrated agent was fever 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.170
 yellow 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.240
 the advances achieved in the techniques 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:20.160
 of modular biology in the decades 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.650
 1980 and 1990 allowed to recognize several 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.700
 new human viruses including the 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:28.650
 human immunodeficiency virus vih 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.840
 besides the hepatitis c virus 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.660
 also the Koran or virus has been with the 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.190
 severe acute respiratory syndrome in addition 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.320
 They are in almost every 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.840
 ecosystems of the earth and are the type 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.880
 most abundant biological entity the 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.130
 study of these has been the name of 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.100
 virology which is a branch of the 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.860
 microbiology the virus is an agent 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:53.550
 genetic that contains a single type of 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:56.310
 nucleic acid be aedn or adn 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.320
 contains a protein coat sometimes 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.960
 included in a lipid envelope 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.540
 carbohydrate protein that surrounds 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.640
 the nucleic acid multiply within 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.640
 of living cells by using the 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.869
 cell synthesis machinery 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.540
 induces people and structures 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.210
 specialized institutions capable of transferring 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.370
 viral nucleic acid to others 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.110
 the only function that the living and 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.330
 that they share with the rest of the beings 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.400
 alive is to reproduce or generate 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.080
 copies of themselves but they need 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.390
 use the matter the energy and the 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.830
 host cell machinery so 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.830
 that are called parasites 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.690
 obligated or dependent do not possess 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.430
 metabolism or cellular organization by 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.650
 what puts them at the limit between what 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.020
 living and nonliving cycles can be 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.120
 Classify in various morphological types 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.910
 these are four the first one then 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.250
 we found the helical viruses the 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.170
 helical viruses resemble long 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.930
 nash grass that can be stiff or 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.640
 flexible the viral nucleic acid is 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.170
 found inside a capsule is the 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.080
 indrhi k hollow with structure 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.240
 helical viruses that cause rabies 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.850
 and the hemorrhagic fever of de bola are 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.460
 helical virus in second place 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.770
 we found many polyhedral viruses 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:10.680
 plant and bacterial animal viruses 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.180
 they are political or of many faces the 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.860
 capacity of most viruses 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.890
 Polyhedrals have the shape of a 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.830
 icosahedron a regular polyhedron with 20 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.960
 triangular faces and 12 angles 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.420
 Shallow of each face form a triangle 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:26.940
 equilateral example of virus 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.430
 polyhedral shaped thing euros is the 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.550
 adenovirus the other viruses and things from 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:35.130
 trico is the third poliovirus 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:36.870
 we found the enveloped viruses as 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.580
 already explained the capacity of some 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.890
 virus is covered by a wrap 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.080
 the enveloped viruses are almost 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.060
 spherical when the ideal viruses or 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:47.400
 Polyhedrals are surrounded by a 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.230
 wrapper are called ico virus 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.050
 ideal is with wrapping or virus 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.060
 polyhedral with wrapping an example of 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.550
 Wrapped helical virus is the 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.920
 influenza virus an example of a virus 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.650
 wrapping politician is the virus 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.170
 herpes dyes in fourth place we have 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.150
 the complex viruses some videos in 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.800
 particular bacterial viruses have 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.320
 the complicated structures and it 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.959
 called complex virus an example of 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.700
 complex virus is the bacteriophage in the 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.100
 which some esophageal masters have 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:20.090
 captions to which structures are attached 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.090
 additional 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:26.440
 next we will explain the cycle 

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:28.690
 critical of a bacteriophage symmetric t 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.479
 first of all we have the stage of 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.970
 fixation in which the phage is harassed 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:36.699
 the host cell in second place 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.379
 we have the penetration stage in the 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:41.650
 which the phage enters the cells 

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:44.919
 host and injects the DNA in third place 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:47.440
 we have the biosynthesis in which the DNA 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:49.389
 of the phage will direct c's in thesis of the 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.970
 viral components through the cell 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:54.340
 guest in fourth place we have the stage 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.949
 of maturation in which the components 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.419
 virals are assembled in billions and in 

00:04:56.949 --> 00:05:00.430
 that in your place we have the stage of 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:02.560
 release the final stage of the 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.960
 viral multiplication is the release of 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.729
 billions for the host cell in 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.889
 In general, the term lysis is used to 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:11.380
 allude to this stage of multiplication 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:12.810
 of symmetric payments because in 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:16.060
 this case the plasma membrane 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.880
 it really breaks or sands to 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:21.159
 Next we will analyze the 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:23.230
 multiplication of potato virus a virus 

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:25.510
 containing DNA 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:28.330
 first of all the video is not fixed to the 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:30.130
 host cell the second place the video 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:33.130
 enters the cell and eliminates the 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:35.680
 dna cover in third place it 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:38.770
 transcribe a portion of viral DNA that 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:42.250
 produces a messenger encoder of the 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:44.560
 original viral proteins in fourth 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:47.230
 place is explained by the viral DNA and 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.160
 manufactures in some viral proteins the 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:50.230
 fifth place 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.200
 the late translation feels to use 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:56.200
 capsid proteins of effect 

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:58.780
 place the billions mature and in seventh 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:01.660
 and last place the millions are released 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:04.090
 to the middle then then the entrance 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:06.970
 of a virus in a host cell to 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:10.600
 through pines and ptosis and then to 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:12.310
 through a merger these are the two 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.230
 means of transport used by the 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:15.960
 virus to enter the cells 

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:18.630
 Guest 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.729
 the viruses once they infect a 

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:23.100
 cell can develop two types of 

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:25.259
 behavior well as agents 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:27.479
 infectious causing lysis or 

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:29.940
 death of the cell or as a virus 

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:32.039
 attenuated that adds genetic material to 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:34.259
 the operant cell and therefore 

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:36.360
 they are agents of variability 

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:38.340
 genetics 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.800
 Without a doubt, biology has 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:42.210
 evolved very fast even the 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.099
 viruses were the first models 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:46.949
 for the study of how the 

00:06:44.099 --> 00:06:48.750
 knowledge genome indispensable today in 

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:51.240
 day for research work in 

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:52.830
 biological sciences is currently 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.870
 consider viruses not only as 

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:56.460
 causing diseases but also 

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:58.349
 as very important agents that 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:01.250
 collaborate with the maintenance of 

00:06:58.349 --> 00:07:01.250
 ecological balance
