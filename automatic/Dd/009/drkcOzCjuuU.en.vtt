side<00:00:18.640> because<00:00:19.119> the<00:00:19.360> other<00:00:20.020> side<00:00:20.470> is<00:00:20.860> on<00:00:21.670> the

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:21.790 
side because the other side is on the

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:27.870 
side because the other side is on the
road<00:00:22.000> at<00:00:22.810> this<00:00:23.050> side<00:00:23.290> is<00:00:23.590> a<00:00:23.860> curb<00:00:24.490> so

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:27.880 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.630 

let's<00:00:28.880> go<00:00:29.030> to<00:00:29.090> the<00:00:29.150> other<00:00:29.270> side<00:00:29.710> okay<00:00:30.710> what<00:00:31.520> we

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
let's go to the other side okay what we

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.810 
let's go to the other side okay what we
do<00:00:31.820> now<00:00:32.150> on<00:00:32.450> this<00:00:32.720> side<00:00:32.990> we<00:00:33.290> do<00:00:33.560> a<00:00:33.770> close<00:00:34.430> pitch

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:34.820 
do now on this side we do a close pitch

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.010 
do now on this side we do a close pitch
and<00:00:35.270> a<00:00:35.960> half<00:00:36.230> and<00:00:36.850> this<00:00:37.850> one<00:00:38.150> make<00:00:38.510> sure<00:00:38.540> no<00:00:38.840> one

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
and a half and this one make sure no one

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.620 
and a half and this one make sure no one
on<00:00:39.050> the<00:00:39.260> other<00:00:39.380> side<00:00:40.120> go<00:00:41.120> on<00:00:41.270> the<00:00:41.360> other<00:00:41.510> side

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:41.630 
on the other side go on the other side

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.100 
on the other side go on the other side
first<00:00:42.670> now<00:00:43.670> basically<00:00:44.000> you<00:00:44.510> let<00:00:44.750> the<00:00:44.900> Rope

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
first now basically you let the Rope

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.750 
first now basically you let the Rope
drop<00:00:45.410> again<00:00:46.840> you<00:00:47.840> call<00:00:48.080> one<00:00:48.320> run<00:00:48.620> on<00:00:49.220> the<00:00:49.430> left

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
drop again you call one run on the left

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.940 
drop again you call one run on the left
and<00:00:50.530> then<00:00:51.530> run<00:00:51.950> run<00:00:52.280> on<00:00:52.970> the<00:00:53.180> right<00:00:53.530> so<00:00:54.530> that<00:00:54.800> is

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:54.950 
and then run run on the right so that is

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.570 
and then run run on the right so that is
called<00:00:55.220> a<00:00:55.370> cross<00:00:55.730> in<00:00:56.290> another<00:00:57.290> half<00:00:57.590> what<00:00:58.489> you

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:58.580 
called a cross in another half what you

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:04.240 
called a cross in another half what you
need<00:00:58.730> to<00:00:58.850> do<00:00:59.000> just<00:01:00.040> riders<00:01:01.040> Brian<00:01:02.830> that<00:01:03.830> is<00:01:03.860> a

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
first of all three simple step first

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.710 
first of all three simple step first
step<00:01:27.979> you<00:01:28.610> go<00:01:28.790> around<00:01:30.340> the<00:01:31.340> Rio<00:01:31.580> oh<00:01:32.030> there's<00:01:32.660> a

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
step you go around the Rio oh there's a

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.110 
step you go around the Rio oh there's a
first<00:01:33.020> step<00:01:33.940> second<00:01:34.940> step<00:01:35.410> you<00:01:36.410> go<00:01:36.590> under<00:01:37.120> the

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.120 
first step second step you go under the

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.460 
first step second step you go under the
rope<00:01:38.390> and<00:01:39.010> grab<00:01:40.010> this<00:01:40.220> one<00:01:40.490> and<00:01:41.020> move<00:01:42.020> this<00:01:42.260> one

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
rope and grab this one and move this one

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.399 
rope and grab this one and move this one
up<00:01:43.690> so<00:01:44.690> this<00:01:44.900> is<00:01:45.020> the<00:01:45.080> second<00:01:45.440> step

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:47.409 
up so this is the second step

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:49.750 
up so this is the second step
but<00:01:47.829> Thursday

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.760 
but Thursday

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:55.260 
but Thursday

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
you put a living through this look and

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.400 
you put a living through this look and
then<00:01:56.380> another<00:01:57.380> one<00:01:57.650> on<00:01:57.770> top<00:01:57.800> and<00:01:59.200> throw<00:02:00.200> this

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.580 
this is called a single truck engage now
to<00:02:13.610> do<00:02:13.820> the<00:02:13.940> double<00:02:14.920> simple<00:02:15.920> simply<00:02:16.820> we<00:02:17.000> just

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
to do the double simple simply we just

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.450 
to do the double simple simply we just
put<00:02:18.590> it<00:02:18.710> right<00:02:18.740> again<00:02:20.980> where<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.250> rope

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
put it right again where the rope

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:29.670 
put it right again where the rope
underneath<00:02:24.070> and<00:02:25.070> live<00:02:25.550> it<00:02:25.700> up<00:02:26.740> again<00:02:27.740> you<00:02:28.340> do<00:02:28.550> a

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
underneath and live it up again you do a

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.610 
underneath and live it up again you do a
loop-de-loop

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.400 

I<00:02:34.210> am

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.970 

come<00:02:38.010> on<00:02:38.190> for<00:02:38.610> the<00:02:38.640> best<00:02:38.880> hygiene<00:02:39.710> for<00:02:40.710> what<00:02:40.890> we

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
come on for the best hygiene for what we

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:48.500 
come on for the best hygiene for what we
need<00:02:41.160> to<00:02:41.250> do<00:02:41.870> we<00:02:42.870> just<00:02:42.900> cool<00:02:43.830> it<00:02:47.090> so<00:02:48.090> once<00:02:48.330> it's

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
need to do we just cool it so once it's

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.940 
need to do we just cool it so once it's
done<00:02:48.540> we<00:02:48.990> do<00:02:49.950> a<00:02:49.980> close<00:02:50.310> hitch<00:02:50.580> to<00:02:50.820> finish<00:02:51.150> it

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
done we do a close hitch to finish it

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.810 
done we do a close hitch to finish it
the<00:02:52.950> clothes<00:02:53.250> hitch<00:02:53.490> is<00:02:53.670> one<00:02:53.880> on<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.090> left<00:02:54.420> and

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
the clothes hitch is one on the left and

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:01.970 
the clothes hitch is one on the left and
one<00:02:56.820> on<00:02:56.850> the<00:02:57.060> right<00:02:58.670> and<00:02:59.670> then<00:02:59.970> just<00:03:00.950> pull<00:03:01.950> up

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
one on the right and then just pull up

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.660 
one on the right and then just pull up
and<00:03:02.250> down<00:03:02.490> to<00:03:02.700> secure<00:03:03.120> this<00:03:03.830> and<00:03:04.830> then<00:03:05.130> after

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
and down to secure this and then after

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.420 
and down to secure this and then after
then<00:03:05.880> because<00:03:06.390> of<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.660> slack<00:03:07.040> we<00:03:08.040> just<00:03:08.250> have

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
then because of the slack we just have

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.660 
then because of the slack we just have
to<00:03:09.170> tighten<00:03:10.170> it<00:03:10.440> anywhere<00:03:10.950> let's<00:03:11.430> make<00:03:11.640> sure

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
to tighten it anywhere let's make sure

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.300 
to tighten it anywhere let's make sure
it<00:03:12.030> up<00:03:12.210> flipping<00:03:12.630> around

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.790 

and<00:03:16.310> that's<00:03:16.550> it<00:03:16.849> so<00:03:17.060> this<00:03:17.270> is<00:03:17.420> called<00:03:17.660> a<00:03:17.930> double

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800
