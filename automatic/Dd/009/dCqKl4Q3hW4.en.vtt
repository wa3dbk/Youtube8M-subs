what's<00:02:15.390> in<00:02:15.510> their<00:02:15.629> beef<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:16.290> goo<00:02:16.500> that<00:02:16.530> they

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
what's in their beef the goo that they

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.220 
what's in their beef the goo that they
use<00:02:17.129> it's<00:02:17.550> pink<00:02:17.970> and<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.569> reason<00:02:18.840> it's<00:02:18.989> pink

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
use it's pink and the reason it's pink

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.990 
use it's pink and the reason it's pink
is<00:02:19.379> because<00:02:19.650> they<00:02:19.800> shave<00:02:20.099> some<00:02:20.340> of<00:02:20.459> it<00:02:20.580> off<00:02:20.790> of

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
is because they shave some of it off of

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.059 
is because they shave some of it off of
the<00:02:21.090> bones<00:02:21.300> and<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.840> blood<00:02:21.989> mixes<00:02:22.590> in<00:02:22.770> yeah

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
the bones and the blood mixes in yeah

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.760 
the bones and the blood mixes in yeah
that's<00:02:23.550> why<00:02:23.760> they<00:02:23.910> got<00:02:24.030> to<00:02:24.180> use<00:02:24.420> that<00:02:24.770> bacteria

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
that's why they got to use that bacteria

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.550 
that's why they got to use that bacteria
killing<00:02:26.010> chemicals<00:02:26.879> to<00:02:27.810> get<00:02:27.989> all<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.349> blood

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
etc out of the goo that's why here you

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.119 
etc out of the goo that's why here you
have<00:02:31.860> 99-cent<00:02:32.760> valued<00:02:33.239> menus<00:02:33.599> because<00:02:34.140> if

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
have 99-cent valued menus because if

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.009 
have 99-cent valued menus because if
you're<00:02:35.340> gonna<00:02:35.459> produce<00:02:36.120> it<00:02:36.390> for<00:02:36.569> that<00:02:36.690> cheap

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
you're gonna produce it for that cheap

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.630 
you're gonna produce it for that cheap
you<00:02:37.260> got<00:02:37.379> to<00:02:37.500> find<00:02:37.650> a<00:02:37.739> way<00:02:37.769> to<00:02:37.860> do<00:02:38.069> it<00:02:38.190> so<00:02:38.519> it's

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
you got to find a way to do it so it's

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.830 
you got to find a way to do it so it's
not<00:02:38.700> like<00:02:38.790> they<00:02:39.060> can't<00:02:39.330> do<00:02:39.510> it<00:02:39.629> with<00:02:39.750> the

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
not like they can't do it with the

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.750 
not like they can't do it with the
bacteria<00:02:40.319> killing<00:02:40.560> things<00:02:41.069> it<00:02:41.489> just<00:02:41.640> will

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
bacteria killing things it just will

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.270 
bacteria killing things it just will
cost<00:02:42.000> you<00:02:42.209> a<00:02:42.239> little<00:02:42.540> more<00:02:42.720> right<00:02:43.410> right<00:02:43.620> Wow

cost you a little more right right Wow
let's<00:02:44.610> go<00:02:44.730> to<00:02:44.790> a<00:02:44.879> dollar<00:02:45.180> Owen<00:02:45.450> I<00:02:45.629> think<00:02:45.900> it's

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
let's go to a dollar Owen I think it's

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:48.290 
let's go to a dollar Owen I think it's
gonna<00:02:46.080> be<00:02:46.260> okay
