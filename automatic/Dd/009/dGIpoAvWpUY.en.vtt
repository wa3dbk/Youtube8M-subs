00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:06.520
 artistic media photographs by 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.910
 which we can express ideas 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:12.490
 feelings etcetera since it involves 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.730
 a sense which is the view to what 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.890
 throughout the story photos have emerged 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.910
 controversial hablese of aliens and 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:24.699
 ghost specters ghosts or witches that 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.849
 they are difficult to explain and the 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:29.890
 veracity of these since we do not know if 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:33.610
 it was a simple edition or actually 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:37.239
 it happened that's why here I will show you 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:41.100
 the 6 strangest images that until the 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.100
 date have not had explanation 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.000
 number 6 lady to look at the 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.250
 Research context 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.170
 developed as a result of the murder of 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:05.049
 john f kennedy jfk by his initials the 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.539
 November 22 , 1963 

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:10.030
 the lady goes looking for the nickname that is 

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:12.640
 designates an unknown woman who could 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.740
 have recorded a movie at the time 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.049
 of the attack on the daley plaza in 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.360
 dallas texas his name comes from 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:21.789
 handkerchief that he wears on his head and that was 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.250
 similar to the ones worn by old women 

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:27.550
 Russian as you can see it on the screen 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:30.130
 number 5 lunar pyramid 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.890
 this image was taken by apollo 17 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:36.130
 during his last flight to the moon near 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.500
 from the area known as geo font rock 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.649
 It was cataloged by NASA as the 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.409
 white after retouching the photo you see that no 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:45.789
 it's completely blank if it goes up 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:48.700
 the contrast can be observed 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:51.009
 pyramidal structures the nasa has never 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.430
 given a credible version on the matter 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:57.580
 number 4 giant tadpole 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:00.280
 in the 1960s a man called 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.890
 Robert Lee Schearer captured the image of 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.160
 a huge tadpole the photograph was 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:09.310
 published for the first time in March 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:12.220
 1965 a detailed account of the case was 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.290
 written by by gvt mans two years 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.810
 later it is believed that the image was 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.930
 trick however, it has not yet been 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:24.459
 confirm that number 3 ghost 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:27.010
 aeronautic photo taken in 1919 photo 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:32.020
 taken in 1919 and was published by 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:34.450
 first time in 1975 for being vÃ­ctor ghost 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.370
 tarp what draws the attention of this 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.350
 image is the ghostly face that 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.600
 appears behind the fourth aviator of the 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.510
 top row counting from the 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.730
 left there you can clearly see the 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.950
 another man's face is said the strange 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.200
 apparition corresponds to freddy jackson 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.570
 an airplane mechanic who had died 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.580
 accidentally by an airplane propeller 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:58.030
 two days before during the first war 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.640
 world number 2 the ghosts of ss 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.250
 wafer show photograph of two sailors 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.769
 that were buried in the sea to the 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.320
 crew of the ship in which they died 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.989
 got them both to appear several 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.000
 times after dying this image is a 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:16.750
 of the most disturbing that I have seen 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.600
 as you can see, they have a 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.750
 lugo pretty grim and appearance 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:25.390
 tenebrous number one the ghost grandfather 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.610
 the case of the photograph taken by 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:32.049
 dennis russell to her grandmother on 17 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:33.430
 August 1997 still surprises after three 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:36.310
 years after having taken the 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.170
 photograph the girl observed that there was a 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.000
 mysterious man standing behind his 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.040
 grandma when the little girl looked over 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.269
 nearby he realized that it was about 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:48.700
 his grandfather who died on August 14 , 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:51.130
 1984 more than 13 years before it 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.799
 did the photograph have been made 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:56.410
 Various tests to check if the photo 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:59.020
 it's real or it was tricked 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.030
 but since you can see it looks pretty 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:05.940
 real in the tall man who is behind 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:10.050
 of the old woman and very common 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:14.170
 with a very macabre face not also this 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:16.780
 no this is not the grandfather is not 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.299
 so much the problem because let's say can 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.579
 be any man who stood behind 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:24.630
 but if you look carefully above the 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:28.210
 red van there is a silhouette like a 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:30.970
 as if resembling death if they can 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:33.389
 observe good well here is where it ends 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:37.270
 the top I hope you liked it 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:41.200
 comment that photo I missed that has not yet 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:42.790
 could have revealed its origin or what 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.889
 happen with her comment on the 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:47.950
