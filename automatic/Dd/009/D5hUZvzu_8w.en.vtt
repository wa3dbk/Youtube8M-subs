00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.300
 I had a body that made sense 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.659
 wallet 

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:25.980
 three hundred payments per night made wenger dandelion 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.859
 the fulana mask of the southern district 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.759
 it was impossible to look at it and not think about putting 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.230
 although water indicated it was more here 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.160
 the men's quarters women ended up pulling her crazy 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.040
 and for many reasons 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.410
 another social worker in the area 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.560
 I went out the kill javi exmiss 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.720
 they did not call it that way 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.870
 p not to mention killing and not exactly cent 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.500
 and do it herself 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.500
 but I prefer to leave it to a professional 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.520
 the same thing happens to me as socrates 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.500
 then we agree 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.500
 before the imminent rise and what is miguel 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.900
 for me as if it had been done 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:50.910
 read 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.540
 but 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.190
 everyday 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.240
 this leaves state and the government of haiti 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.080
 but 2002 and 2008 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.440
 daniel professionals recognize new peer 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.880
 the end of the match 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.729
 opposite the designer of the dress 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.939
 that's why he thought that the rest 

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:15.939
 the cops before were not very far from the truth 

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:19.599
 what to leave had been a natural death 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.870
 when you hit your head someone tell you pairs for ten minutes 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.870
 many self-help experts 

00:02:28.279 --> 00:02:31.479
 and as for running away 

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:34.479
 that the only law I know is the fifth edition law 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.689
 as it is called notes 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:40.869
 betrayal for treason 

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:43.029
 in my town they said 

00:02:43.029 --> 00:02:45.279
 as is usual 

00:02:45.279 --> 00:02:46.859
 that I am a gentleman 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:49.459
 just let hours go by on it 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.790
 because if chivalry is lost what is going to be of this world
