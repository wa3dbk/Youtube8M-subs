00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.980
 the custom is newly born will be 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:10.600
 use but in another time it is done in the 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:14.170
 ceremony that they call here maricón 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:16.480
 physical fagot is done once a year 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:19.270
 similar to this but it is already used to 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.130
 horses are used other elements that very 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:25.269
 special 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:27.820
 and this as I said, I'm just never 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:31.359
 it had looked more or less orientations 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:36.420
 had by my grandparents my dad my 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:40.180
 mom then the other day the 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.220
 chance to make myself 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.060
 what I wanted to do to train that 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.280
 part of the daughter 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.590
 what did they come together? 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.220
 today 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:55.590
 where I told him that if he was good 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:59.420
 so as not to erase our identity 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.519
 not to let it happen more year 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.230
 so I had to make head of 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:05.750
 is 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.010
 to open the act and to bless 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.300
 our temple 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.670
 to bless 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.979
 our young people who got married 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:19.250
 there was quite a crowd in this 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:22.790
 moment and the day also lent them the 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:25.479
 day is a special day that I thank 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:29.299
 God the Mapuche has a culture 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:33.409
 open a culture you need to practice it 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:36.399
 you need to exercise it where the person has 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:39.050
 that have desire will and 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:43.520
 thanks from our Lord 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:45.600
 the very religious Mapuche has for 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.690
 first place 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:52.990
 after the morning every day 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:58.860
 oden's first mate says 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:02:02.259
 precise moment at the right time 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:05.950
 doing it by listing the goods 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:10.770
 what do you need as a work welfare 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:13.210
 food animals water pasture 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.900
 and just like that 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.900
 have 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.790
 and this when we have raised each 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:24.829
 1000 which is significant not why 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.219
 we had thought to raise the flag in 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:30.550
 the mast that was planted and one of 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:34.240
 the girl said no 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:37.380
 that the Filipino community is already added 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:41.140
 each department that is ready 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:44.740
 when the flag was never used this 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.810
 his estimate 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.870
 so that's why the next flag 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.150
 there I think it's a blessing for this 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:56.860
 marriage a very young couple who 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:59.230
 I know that he joins that he really is 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.560
 our community is a story is a 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:05.140
 new story since for my dad 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.030
 they were talks of their grandparents of their 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.960
 ancestors and for us we are 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:14.690
 It is a re tion culture that has 

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:18.530
 could my dad achieve in this meeting 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:21.740
 That is chatting a little number 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:24.380
 things I told you just this 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:30.040
 when you start to chat what 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:34.400
 feel one as Mapuche I just said 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:38.270
 today the media the newspaper the press all 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.610
 The world speaks of human trafficking 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.850
 people of women 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.650
 and trafficking in women always existed 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:50.240
 a whole life existing and that we went 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:52.080
 colonized since we went in a 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:55.050
 way to say today 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:59.400
 remember a conquest of the desert the 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:01.860
 rock era is not this when many 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.880
 Sometimes my dad told us 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.950
 and my grandmother was something my dad said 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:09.990
 and we asked what we say but 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.810
 why my grandmother thing 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.700
 if we saw them mapuches maybe mestiza 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.560
 but it was mapuche 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.900
 so I have a sister who lives in 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:23.490
 san martín today and it was one of those that 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:26.460
 I researched his family tree and where 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.800
 he also investigates because he was told 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:32.770
 the grandmother was a thing 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:36.190
 it was at the time of rocks we went were 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:39.120
 scampered from one side to the other until 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.120
 they came to jujuy 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:47.250
 when in the harvest season of 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:49.740
 sugar this were abducted many 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:52.730
 women and men to the work of the 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:57.510
 bondage if you can say then 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:59.730
 this in a careless this grandmother can 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:03.780
 get away from that place and be able to return 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:07.260
 towards what was its origin the 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:11.190
 origin of the Mapuche land of the place 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:13.410
 Mapuche then for us when 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:16.380
 they talk about people today clear this 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:18.330
 it's much stronger because today you can 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:22.470
 to denounce it can be said that it is 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:25.020
 not before them since twelve years 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.430
 that I always made a promise to myself 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.610
 day I got married very much home 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:31.710
 puche and good thank God today I'm 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:39.110
 here enjoying this beautiful ceremony 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:39.110
 What happened to my family and what happens 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:45.430
 let's not get broadcast because 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:48.130
 when we start depending on the 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:50.860
 steam wedding che and good we talk 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:52.390
 with my dad and the good put he got to 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.940
 work and good thank God gave 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:55.920
 diffusion 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:58.140
 Y 

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.569
 when we started working we would have 

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:04.439
 we had 

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:06.830
 many setbacks when we start with 

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:09.179
 there we are very discouraged because no 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:12.439
 we got things that we needed that 

00:06:09.179 --> 00:06:12.439
 really we could not 

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:24.150
 doors and we could 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:24.150
 start putting everything together to plan everything 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:28.830
 I have my uncle Angel Clares Point 

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:34.500
 cases 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:37.650
 the day to help us recover the 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:40.530
 culture the culture and I hope it's done 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:42.660
 this diffusion and not only 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:45.210
 do here in this area but do 

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:47.880
 everywhere that is also very cute 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:50.340
 so that young people more than anything 

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:53.150
 know and say and take into account and that 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.150
 all is not lost
