for<00:03:04.210> me<00:03:04.510> so<00:03:04.840> when<00:03:04.990> I<00:03:05.020> found<00:03:05.290> out<00:03:05.530> that<00:03:05.740> there

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
for me so when I found out that there

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:07.860 
for me so when I found out that there
was<00:03:06.490> interior<00:03:06.850> design<00:03:07.120> on<00:03:07.240> the<00:03:07.330> island<00:03:07.690> I<00:03:07.750> was

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
was interior design on the island I was

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.450 
was interior design on the island I was
so<00:03:08.050> excited<00:03:08.170> because<00:03:08.650> I<00:03:08.950> just<00:03:09.010> love<00:03:09.220> Vancouver

Island<00:03:10.060> and<00:03:10.420> I<00:03:10.720> just<00:03:11.350> seemed<00:03:11.530> like<00:03:11.560> a<00:03:11.710> perfect

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
Island and I just seemed like a perfect

Island and I just seemed like a perfect
fit<00:03:12.160> for<00:03:12.280> me<00:03:12.550> I'm<00:03:13.450> from<00:03:13.750> catch<00:03:14.200> one<00:03:14.500> small<00:03:14.890> town

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.630 
fit for me I'm from catch one small town
and<00:03:15.430> I<00:03:15.970> ended<00:03:16.330> up<00:03:16.450> at<00:03:16.690> EIU<00:03:17.110> because<00:03:18.040> there

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
and I ended up at EIU because there

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.430 
and I ended up at EIU because there
aren't<00:03:18.940> many<00:03:19.150> programs<00:03:19.750> that<00:03:19.990> offer<00:03:20.020> the

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
aren't many programs that offer the

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.170 
aren't many programs that offer the
four-year<00:03:20.830> degree<00:03:21.160> I<00:03:21.400> wanted<00:03:21.700> the<00:03:21.850> degree

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
four-year degree I wanted the degree

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.480 
four-year degree I wanted the degree
because<00:03:22.990> you<00:03:23.380> need<00:03:23.590> it<00:03:23.620> in<00:03:23.860> order<00:03:24.010> to<00:03:24.220> become<00:03:24.340> a

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.490 
because you need it in order to become a

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.650 
because you need it in order to become a
registered<00:03:24.730> designer<00:03:25.360> also<00:03:26.140> I<00:03:26.940> think<00:03:27.940> that<00:03:28.420> we

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
registered designer also I think that we

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.580 
registered designer also I think that we
make<00:03:29.310> everyday<00:03:30.310> life<00:03:30.610> functional<00:03:31.240> I<00:03:31.590> mean

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
make everyday life functional I mean

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.770 
make everyday life functional I mean
when<00:03:32.860> you<00:03:32.950> walk<00:03:33.160> into<00:03:33.370> a<00:03:33.489> space<00:03:33.850> you<00:03:34.510> don't

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
when you walk into a space you don't

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.290 
when you walk into a space you don't
notice<00:03:35.170> if<00:03:35.500> it's<00:03:35.680> designed<00:03:36.100> properly<00:03:36.459> but<00:03:37.120> you

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
notice if it's designed properly but you

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.940 
notice if it's designed properly but you
definitely<00:03:37.570> notice<00:03:38.080> if<00:03:38.410> it's<00:03:38.560> designed

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
definitely notice if it's designed
