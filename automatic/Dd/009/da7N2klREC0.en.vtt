00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.920
 hello today we are going to learn to do the 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.440
 point of the reverse that has an aspect 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:13.150
 similar to this one 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.779
 to make the point of the reverse the only thing 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:19.869
 what we have to do is pass the wool 

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:22.090
 above the right needle beige 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.660
 we went over here and then he gets 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.860
 the needle up 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:32.180
 so it happens 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:34.430
 stretch here low and you get reminded 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.350
 always at the point of the right it would be 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.930
 well with the porous needle with the wool by 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.860
 low and putting the needle in here and in 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:46.250
 the other way round we passed it over 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:50.180
 and the needle goes up 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:53.660
 it goes through there and stretches we go to 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:56.680
 do another one is passed 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.680
 and stretch 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.640
 you see 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.640
 It is very simple 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.049
 and we stretch only to tell you one thing 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:46.900
 when you are knitting the point of 

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:49.780
 reverse on the opposite side of the fabric 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:52.450
 what you see is right point are points 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.940
 contrary as when we weave 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.500
 point of the right for the other part of the 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.500
 Woven looks backward point
