00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.380
 to this activity to this radio the media 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.970
 Latin Americans in the United Kingdom as 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.250
 it has felt in london elevation not 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.680
 Well first of all the emotion is 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.930
 great because everything sports and we're 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.220
 ready to work more Olympics 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.220
 already being here and I think it's 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.950
 we all come with expectations and desire 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.720
 to give everything to soften the country in 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.840
 high you feel right now 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.790
 sebastián and hours previous days 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.200
 Well the truth is I'm a bit tired 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.490
 because the trainings of us 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.780
 they are still being a bit strong 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.650
 because there are several days left for the 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.270
 competition 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.220
 for the emotion the desire to compete 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.800
 they had removed us good how he has seen 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.940
 the Colombian delegation and especially 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.620
 for what you come to do to 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.870
 Cancer 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.310
 well I think that general colombia that year 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.080
 comes much stronger than the 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.550
 previous olympics then all the 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.930
 team is like very excited and very at 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.430
 the expectation that it will happen in this 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.050
 olympics do not remember that all 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.220
 Latin American viewers about 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:22.820
 his achievements in sports 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:25.380
 I am a marginal champion of 2000 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.040
 Pan-American today finalist of world 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.020
 the heavy economic networks 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.580
 but of course of dream to be in the 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.290
 podium in station 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.150
 good is something we do not talk about 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:39.180
 We are not used to talking 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:42.000
 talk about doing it but 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.920
 of life where athletes 6 everything 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.200
 sportsman and dream economy I clean 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.540
 from the time of competition of a 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.340
 diver or to what age can they 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.820
 be you participants good in 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.040
 average is between 28 and 30 years but 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.420
 there are classes that arrive 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:04.119
 and as the moment d 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.460
 good stuck in Colombia was 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:09.200
 going through a stage of development 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.660
 of which we are part 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.390
 so I think olimpia back 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.940
 olimpiada the world after world 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.380
 sport will and will improve what was the 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.540
 key to that classification to 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.340
 olympics and they did a very training 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.620
 strong last year since last year 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.710
 we have been coming in 8 and a half hours a day 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.810
 of administration 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.640
 and the support of the 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.860
 same Colombian government through 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.080
 coldeportes yes of course we always 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.750
 we have supported their unforeseen 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.660
 back with the strong 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.910
 sebastián and because you chose the 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.490
 nailed and not any other cut 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.770
 well the truth is that something confusing because 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.140
 I used to be gymnastics and swimming and 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:52.320
 One day they are looking for talents to 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.120
 stuck and I did not give it to try and 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.010
 here I stayed that is the hardest part of 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.569
 do in your specialty 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.030
 but I think the competitions are 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.740
 really difficult because 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.520
 a competition consisting of six 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.990
 jumps and if it fails is one really the 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.180
 Good Sebastian, we're going to be very 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11.490
 attentive to their development in our 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.990
 olympic games and hopefully it's a very 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.550
 good news for our country 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:16.320
 thank you very much experimentation and nothing 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.030
 we hope on behalf of the entire team 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.340
 Colombian give you many joys very 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.140
