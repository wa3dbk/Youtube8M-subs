00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.449
 hello to all so welcome to this 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:16.430
 new course in cell physiology 

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:17.870
 today we will study the reticulum 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.880
 endoplasmic so we will make a 

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:22.340
 introduction then we will study 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:26.410
 the rough endoplasmic reticulum and 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.410
 finally the endoplasmic reticulum lilies 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.850
 so to begin what you need to know 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.579
 is that we are going to have two varieties of 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.559
 endoplasmic reticulum the reticulum 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.809
 endoplasmic dillies what will be done 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.269
 of hungry networks you bull who are 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.039
 interconnected we see here besides 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:45.679
 there we are no longer in the reticulum 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:48.469
 endoplasmic smooth and finally we have the 

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:51.079
 rough endoplasmic reticulum so he 

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:54.350
 it will be comprised of flattened bags 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.999
 will be stacked and in continuity with the 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.109
 previous bags so here we are at this 

00:00:55.999 --> 00:00:59.960
 level there the endoplasmic reticulum 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:03.019
 rugby here what you see in purple 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:05.510
 the nuclear envelope the silk the 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:07.550
 core membrane so does the 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.160
 ridiculous in two places slips me his 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:13.910
 screaming is real and rer or hered for 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:16.040
 rough granular for so here is so 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.390
 in fact these two reticulum will be in 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.430
 continuity 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.640
 with each other we see it on the 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:25.910
 schema they are continuity so the type 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.610
 of cellular activity will determine the 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:32.660
 amount of rebels or herding in 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:35.510
 depending on whether the cell is 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.760
 producing or not a large quantity 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.890
 of proteins for secretion 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:47.110
 for example, well we'll have a lot more 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:49.340
 of hergÃ© so the endoplasmic reticulum 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.590
 granular it is said granular precisely 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.880
 because on its outer membrane and 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.240
 small points that we see are 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.390
 ribosomes the ribosome is a complex of 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.920
 proteins and queens that will have 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.970
 function of synthesizing 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:07.010
 proteins so the different stages of 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.770
 this protein synthesis so first 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.350
 we will have the synthesis of a May arn 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.780
 ag an arn messengers i'll call you back and 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:18.140
 synthesize from a boss adn 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.620
 so that's a replica let's say from 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.440
 the dna so this synthesis of the rnm is going 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:27.680
 to be in the kernel and then this 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.480
 arn messengers will come out of the kernel and he 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.120
 will find a ribosome 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.610
 then the ribosome will synthesize the 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.280
 protein from the rnm 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.820
 so the message that there is in the rnm is going 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.680
 to form the polypeptide sequence 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.480
 this protein 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.430
 I want to make it clear that this mode of 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.550
 functioning is the same for 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.770
 ribosomes soon zholy ktz ie 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:55.310
 free ribosomes in the ground site 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:57.610
 or the ribosomes that are contiguous to 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.960
 the endoplasmic reticulum membrane 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.430
 so as I tell you as I come from 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:07.040
 you say it there will exist ribosomes 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:09.920
 free in the sidobre so the proteins 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:13.340
 that will be synthesized via the ribosome 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.870
 rough endoplasmic reticulum are going to 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.970
 go into the light of the hero what we 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.440
 call the light of the happy it's going to be 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.330
 the interior actually 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.100
 see the little balls synthesized 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.020
 the protein is the protein goes next 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.820
 end up inside so these 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:29.810
 proteins are going to have two types of 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.950
 destinations so any one all 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.200
 first there may be some protein 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.890
 which will be intended for export out 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.140
 of the cell 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:38.630
 this is the case of secretion products 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:42.320
 like hormones or enzymes 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:44.390
 and finally second possible destination 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:47.090
 it's going to be inside the cell 

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:50.270
 finally palm inside but rather the 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.709
 tuning membranes because when when 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:54.709
 some proteins are intended for 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:57.140
 internal functioning of the cell 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.810
 they are synthesized in the site to 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.830
 balances what I meant by that 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.170
 it's that second destination 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:06.950
 when the proteins synthesized on the 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.989
 re will be the membrane so these proteins 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.989
 will be used for the construction of 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:15.580
 membrane or else there than others 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.580
 protein constituents of organelles 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:22.450
 so I made you a little diagram 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:25.880
 so finally diagram 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:28.220
 quito flowchart so when the rer 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.630
 is abundant is that the cells are going 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.500
 be specialized in synthesis 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.950
 protein 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:37.490
 so we're going to have cells that are going 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.930
 secrete the digestive pond ponds in 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.190
 this category of cells 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.600
 specialized in protein synthesis 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:46.220
 or the fast growing cells 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:50.120
 such as the immature cells of the 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.380
 fetus these are two types of cells that 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.360
 are specialized in synthesis 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:59.080
 protein and and in its cells 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:59.080
 precisely the re and the rer is abundant 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:05.630
 then what you need to know is that it 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:07.490
 has no ribosome ie that the 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.840
 ridiculous at mans 2 plasmic and nice 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.820
 because he does not have a ribosome 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.340
 he will not intervene in the synthesis 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.170
 protein in general it will serve as 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.630
 place of passage for the molecules that 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:19.880
 will be destined to leave the hero go 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:24.500
 to make a transit through this reticulum 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:27.110
 endoplasmic smooth and finally the 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.450
 endoplasmic reticulum lice begins to 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.880
 fundamentally how does it work and well the 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:35.540
 membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum lys 

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:37.760
 will budge see there their vehicle 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.470
 before placing a rough and there we have 

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.710
 the lily or see no ribosomes on it 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:44.600
 so the membrane will bud a 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.820
 transport vesicle will come off on 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:50.900
 see her there and the blister then me 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:53.680
 won the golgi complex so here you go 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:56.900
 for the endoplasmic reticulum lice 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:57.890
 so I wish you a good day 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.690
 and good luck 

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:01.190
 I hope this body was fast and 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.670
 in the next move we will study 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:06.650
 the golgi apparatus and the system 

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:08.810
 from exonhit to endocytosis so here I am 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:12.040
 wish you a good day and good 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.040
 goodbye evening 

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:26.320
 not
