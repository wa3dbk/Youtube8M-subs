00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
all know about this so Eddie Johnson is

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:51.460 
all know about this so Eddie Johnson is
already<00:01:49.890> quite<00:01:50.250> a<00:01:50.310> lot<00:01:50.490> because<00:01:50.610> of<00:01:50.790> finches<00:01:51.390> a

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
already quite a lot because of finches a

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.990 
already quite a lot because of finches a
legend<00:01:52.470> secure<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.710> team<00:01:52.950> Camilo<00:01:53.520> is<00:01:53.700> another

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
legend secure the team Camilo is another

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.959 
legend secure the team Camilo is another
one<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.270> watch<00:01:54.450> out<00:01:54.659> for<00:01:55.250> also<00:01:56.250> I<00:01:56.280> think<00:01:56.549> there

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
one to watch out for also I think there

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.690 
one to watch out for also I think there
is<00:01:57.119> a<00:01:57.149> centre-back<00:01:57.810> who<00:01:58.530> is<00:01:58.829> Eva<00:01:59.100> bronze<00:01:59.460> or

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
is a centre-back who is Eva bronze or

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.310 
is a centre-back who is Eva bronze or
silver<00:01:59.729> I<00:02:00.180> think<00:02:00.420> he<00:02:00.509> might<00:02:00.659> be<00:02:00.689> bronze<00:02:01.020> still

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
silver I think he might be bronze still

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.399 
silver I think he might be bronze still
but<00:02:01.890> um<00:02:02.070> I<00:02:02.490> think<00:02:03.000> he's<00:02:03.119> called<00:02:03.420> opara<00:02:03.960> and

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
but um I think he's called opara and

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.550 
but um I think he's called opara and
he's<00:02:04.890> got<00:02:05.280> about<00:02:05.490> 86<00:02:06.119> pace<00:02:06.390> so<00:02:06.659> I'm<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:07.320> best

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
he's got about 86 pace so I'm the best

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.320 
he's got about 86 pace so I'm the best
thing<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.740> do<00:02:07.950> is<00:02:08.129> go<00:02:08.340> on<00:02:08.520> over<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:08.819> fight<00:02:09.149> head

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
thing to do is go on over to fight head

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.840 
thing to do is go on over to fight head
