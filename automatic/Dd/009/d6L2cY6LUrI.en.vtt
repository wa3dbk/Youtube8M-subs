00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:10.340
 the oceans cover 70% of the 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:13.930
 surface of the earth and contain more 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.930
 of 20,000 species of fish 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:19.300
 of these 370 are sharks 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:28.230
 before there were dinosaurs 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:31.140
 sharks were already in the water 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.210
 appeared more than 400 million 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.890
 years and have changed very little in the 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.890
 last 100 million years 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:44.290
 at present few species in the 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.290
 earth infuse so much respect 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:51.940
 And fear 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.560
 these amazing predators occupy the 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.090
 upper part of the food chain 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.550
 Marine 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:01.440
 by eliminating the weak and injured help 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.440
 to maintain a balanced ecosystem 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.619
 Sharks are very hunter machines 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.689
 well adapted that depend on their 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:13.900
 specialized senses to hunt their 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:15.790
 dams employing their developed sense 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:20.580
 of the ear can detect vibrations 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.580
 Sound 900 meters away 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.780
 are especially sensitive to 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.790
 low frequency pulsations 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.909
 produced by a dam that is 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.909
 struggling 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.170
 the vibrations of this high speaker 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.090
 produce sounds that resemble 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.330
 of a wounded animal and excite the 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.330
 sharks 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.729
 your sense of smell goes into action 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.729
 when they approach the dam 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:53.790
 can detect a single drop of blood 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.550
 in more than 100 liters of water 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.410
 the water flows through your nose located in 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.940
 the lower part of your face and you 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.170
 provides a lot of 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.170
 olfactory information 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.519
 in the lower part of his face too 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:11.700
 they have pores full of one 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:13.410
 gelatinous substance these collect the 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.069
 electrical signals that are produced when 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.290
 move an animal 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.629
 they are like an extra sense that helps 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.790
 the sharks find their prey yet 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:24.790
 when it is hidden in the sand 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:31.560
 when we think of sharks not 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.560
 we can stop thinking about your teeth 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.480
 sharks use and lose their 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.849
 teeth all the time 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.190
 some species lose as many as 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:45.049
 30,000 during his life but the 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.049
 replacements are always there 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.900
 the rows of teeth allow one 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:51.900
 new is placed where it is needed 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:03:00.220
 In addition to its reputation, something more than 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.220
 distinguish is your skeleton 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.750
 It consists of strong cartilages and 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.940
 flexible instead of bones 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.950
 the cartilages are lighter than the 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.140
 bones and when the sharks swim 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.330
 they use less energy than fish with 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.070
 skeleton partners 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.350
 a hard skin covers your body 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.840
 aerodynamic 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.240
 structures similar to small teeth 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.950
 They give your skin a texture similar to 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.610
 sandpaper that protects them from 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.860
 injuries 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.900
 these teeth are pointing towards 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.740
 back to reduce resistance to 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.740
 water when nothing 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.310
 many advantages make the 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.900
 sharks in one of the most efficient 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.900
 predators of the earth 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:53.090
 many of them are designed to 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.090
 attack but not all do 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:59.819
 actually most sharks 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.819
 they do not attack man 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.460
 we still have a lot to learn from 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.830
 these mysterious and poorly understood 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:11.750
 creatures the scientists continue 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.750
 deciphering their secrets
