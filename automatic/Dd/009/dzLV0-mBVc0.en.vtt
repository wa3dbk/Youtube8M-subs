00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.910
 good to everyone it sounds like veil 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.070
 and I have decided to make this video 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.450
 tutorial to try to clarify the doubts 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.920
 that you have with the issue of the edition 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.230
 of the pro evolution data file 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:21.160
 2013 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.160
 station 3 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.350
 on the web examine a user who 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.960
 call 7 today or they will be today 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.689
 where I put a link to the web 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.690
 evo web of which I am a user makes 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:38.150
 a lot of time 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:42.180
 the most important is our usb 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:44.670
 barbarians in the data file 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.199
 and put it on the pc 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.199
 with the steps that we do next 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:57.640
 but what we have to be clear about is 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.900
 to manage the rut program 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.610
 because he knows cat 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.590
 in the capital joke files where 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.090
 is this program installed we have to 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.770
 put there our folder of that grateful 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.299
 so then the program when it 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:15.899
 run automatically take that file 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:16.979
 which is the one is good and I charge it good 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:19.130
 now they know people I'm just going to 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.730
 explain a little more 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:25.100
 more let's say more in detail 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:26.990
 In the first image 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.590
 we can see that a download 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.830
 automatically you have to 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.730
 is to invite him 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.730
 what we need 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.990
 and we will have the folder 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.100
 and convert 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.100
 and we passed 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.729
 Y 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.880
 and we can pass 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.880
 to the editor 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.500
 we will not have loaded it is a file 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.670
 who created them when converting a multi 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.150
 converter 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.170
 we give him 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.170
 can make the faces 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.310
 you open a small 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.980
 once achieved state only in crypt 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:34.450
 arrest him after the program that leads 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.450
 on that day to enjoy it 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.680
 remember that is that you have to try it 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.079
 new 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.520
 I only had messages after that 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:55.260
 verify it 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.670
 and when this is done because verification 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.670
 arrives is all right 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.400
 automatically that saavedra file 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.400
 is 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.020
 we put it back in the usb 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.000
 to load it on the play 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.970
 and we will obviously have the data that 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.819
 there are previous ones that we had or with a 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.540
 user do it in a way that 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.920
 of your people 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.819
 Well I hope you have stayed a little 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.819
 more clear 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:31.420
 and luck anyway I will upload my 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:34.230
 I can taste 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.230
 so you can take advantage
