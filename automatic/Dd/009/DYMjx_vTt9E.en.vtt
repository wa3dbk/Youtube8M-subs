00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:07.379
 jo people what goes from seb s.start 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.700
 this beautiful sunny day yes and 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.730
 That's the last sentence I hear 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.130
 time to say quite often seems as 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.599
 the weather would be back in germany 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.980
 a bit nicer in Germany 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.539
 and of course that makes me happy 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.010
 so I have to go to Germany 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.930
 stay while the boys are 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.920
 Colombia the sun in full trains 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.529
 enjoy 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.180
 yes but in this video you should not turn around 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.630
 the really good weather in germany 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.099
 right now, but it's about it 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.850
 go how long you should train him 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.260
 So questions like in the year when 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.910
 I do not like how long should I exercise 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.760
 or may I stay longer than an hour 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.500
 train or because she is not that 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.010
 training for two hours negative 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.260
 control counter-productive on it 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.300
 I'll take a moment and two years 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.730
 So this whole argument something 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.379
 long training is bad 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.920
 Actually always on hormones so 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:02.129
 when we raise or grope the cortisol 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.930
 lowers when you train for a long time and 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.780
 as always in my last 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.790
 also said videos and also ours 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.310
 private video have the hormone in the 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.290
 normal range does not affect the 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.090
 So body composition has muscles 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.000
 build up or degrease 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.040
 that is if your testosterone values ​​in 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.500
 normal range are a bit through 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.960
 training now succeeded in training 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.090
 a little further down is screwed 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.610
 then that has no effect 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.020
 the muscle building or in other words her 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.630
 because of the no worse 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.150
 build muscle differently with cortisol 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.939
 even so there are studies that way 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.070
 been that high cortisol values after 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.259
 the training is better for 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.700
 Muscle development is still a high 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:50.399
 volume is not a high volume one should 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.170
 so say when are high 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.850
 volume has made then you have high 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.850
 cortisol values ​​is a high wild game 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.590
 just a pretty good one already for that 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.520
 body just to adapt and 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.219
 to build muscle 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.530
 as I said volume thus the 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.880
 most crucial if relevant to this 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.910
 volume is thus the most crucial 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.619
 when time to build muscle or 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.450
 Build up money on the ground should 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.910
 that is exactly how long we train 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.129
 So needs a new plan just says 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.620
 you shall five by five crosses with 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:22.260
 make five minutes break then 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.700
 you just have to train for two hours 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.050
 if you have other things afterwards 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.540
 trained in computing 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.730
 then no one will finish in 15 minutes 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.230
 and on the ground should and 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.849
 really do not look at the time except 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.370
 you do not have them if you are now 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:37.290
 somehow something to do or if you have 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.670
 is little time have stress in my time 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.290
 yes then you can look at the time 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.900
 but otherwise if it stops 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.680
 Muscle building or other is no matter how 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.690
 train for a long time 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.090
 the funny thing is that the people too 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.830
 somehow do not check that people 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.959
 are still the whole talking at 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.790
 training and after two hours always 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.950
 have made even less volume than 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.930
 a type of the area hours trained and 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.140
 makes short breaks and a lot of volume 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.959
 short time and now that of the two 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.610
 trained hours and yes less 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.319
 Made because of the type of one hour 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.849
 has trained poor hormone levels 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.209
 So I have to say worse around 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:13.860
 unworthy of persons etc 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:15.000
 as the type of two hours trained 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.040
 But nothing has in the two hours 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.930
 For the reason has already noticed 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.640
 that the whole argumentation structure 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.170
 for this long train display 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.900
 bad complete nonsense is 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.159
 how did you get it so I think so 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.080
 most things go on somewhere 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:29.640
 Originally why you say you should 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.560
 No more than an hour of training 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.569
 a normal workout takes one 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.599
 minute to two breaks 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:38.040
 sit down and do a muscle workout 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:40.170
 so perhaps train consciously as, for example 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.299
 other is a one hour 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.310
 damn high volume can drive and 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:46.019
 if he has two hours at the same pace 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.209
 He would train with ease 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.280
 The volume is so high that it just 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.140
 because productions become productive 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.819
 frequencies would suffer 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.290
 that's probably why you got it 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.909
 hey said at some point 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.650
 the hour workout is all about in 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:01.989
 sex or else that does not matter 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.939
 make sense here since the 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:05.260
 Heavy training, the longer you have to 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:07.540
 train to progress again 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.859
 make it just reach it 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.840
 ten minutes are no longer missing 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:12.219
 that was it with the video 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.870
 if you liked the video me 

00:04:12.219 --> 00:04:15.549
 but a thumb highly commented 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.139
 Subscribes and shears the video with the 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:18.609
 I wish you all the world otherwise 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:22.139
 Another extremely cool day and we 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.139
 see us in the next video the skin
