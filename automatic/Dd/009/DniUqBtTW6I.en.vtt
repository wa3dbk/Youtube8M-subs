00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:06.540
 and how she told him my name 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.429
 I'm from california some principle of 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.719
 last year 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:17.580
 he weighed 600 pounds 15 and the waist were 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:21.840
 80 and a half inches had a night that 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.970
 I could not sleep has extreme pain in 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.220
 the subject as it is feet and my hands 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.290
 they were swollen and it was stopping me 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.240
 do what I most wanted to do that was 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.910
 have my baby in my arm only 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.129
 in the follow-up basically I already 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.739
 had surrendered had stopped trying 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:39.749
 lose the weight I can not find a 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.659
 system that gave me results and I thought 

00:00:39.749 --> 00:00:45.059
 that the only possibility I had is 

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:47.280
 that come to work to the stomach 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.649
 it closed me go to work one 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.059
 operation was already very little time 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.050
 do that until I found herbalife 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.730
 rent the project for good health 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.980
 dissolution 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:02.160
 the little things that people 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.589
 really do not consider like for example 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.979
 be able to sit in a seat on an airplane 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.729
 it's a great option for me the chairs 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:14.930
 they have armrests I could not use them 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:18.420
 for my wife many times we had to 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:21.240
 going to a restaurant had to go 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.340
 before me and I had to see if the 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.229
 restaurant is a table 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.070
 these chairs and after hugs for 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:31.800
 that I could sit down because they wait 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.200
 things and in which she had to 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.340
 give me my shoes and put it on because 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.690
 I could not even bend over to do the 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.430
 difference between now that moment is 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.250
 that now I can do small things 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.990
 that people do not really think 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.910
 and they think I can do things like 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.399
 be my shoes and go up to a 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:53.490
 airplane seat and things so 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.979
 they really have rewarded you very much 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.240
 you speak of a photograph that is worth a thousand 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.310
 words I think you have 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.200
 amazing photographs to share 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.390
 with all these people 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.479
 because you do not go through the process of 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.000
 how did you go from the beginning and 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.950
 until the moment you followed 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.280
 all the changes that you have suffered in the 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:18.080
 path 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.080
 first 90 days lost 100 pounds 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:24.610
 I think it's late 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.800
 when I had lost 150 pounds was my 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.290
 first photo I did not take the photo of the 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:34.480
 first 100 pounds this was the day 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:39.010
 number 1 615 days my first day after 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.610
 I lost 150 there that really made me very 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.860
 happy 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:46.150
 the first number 100 pounds I 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:50.320
 they did start really but the thing 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:52.530
 and there I lost 200 pounds in 8 months the 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:56.380
 first time I went on stage to 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:58.630
 receive the 200 200 pound brooch 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.150
 de marius learns on stage at 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.930
 first event that had gone and I could 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.930
 receive that 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:13.549
 I'm not very sure the first year this 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.650
 it's the first year he had lost 273 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:17.660
 wonderful pounds exactly in one 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.740
 year 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:23.400
 was improving and improving as 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:26.580
 that I passed the time I had the pleasure in 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:33.480
 Orlando receiving books from 300 blacks 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:35.840
 marcus numbers sometimes it gets a 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:39.150
 little confusing because everything happened very fast 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:42.500
 but this was my photograph before 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:49.520
 Orlando had already lost 310 pounds 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:49.520
 325 pounds in less than 14 months how many 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:58.580
 we were taking note was more than 200 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:04:02.430
 inches and I know we're almost there now 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:05.940
 43 covers on my waist only 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:08.470
 to give you security started when 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:15.510
 I'm now 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:18.120
 my thighs are smaller than the part 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:21.290
 of my calves 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.290
 I have really changed 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:27.930
 let's say the equivalent of four 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:33.360
 sizes of what is 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:35.850
 It's amazing that you've supported a lot 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.530
 she is one of the two reasons more 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:41.090
 important why I did this 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:43.370
 to start her with my daughter britney 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:47.990
 were the main reasons for the 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:53.030
 which when you started had just 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:56.479
 born and really I wanted to be 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:58.820
 healthy and to see her grow and 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:05:01.850
 I was reaching the extreme in which I 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:04.430
 I was not going to see her really I 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:07.310
 I felt dying and I was scared I knew 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:11.990
 that I had to do something just to 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:15.590
 can start and only 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:17.870
 I was getting up and after 15 minutes 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.970
 it was a very difficult situation if it was a 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:23.110
 emergency decision could not 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:23.110
 have help
