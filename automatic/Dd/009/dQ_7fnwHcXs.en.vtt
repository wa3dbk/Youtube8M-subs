00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:08.460
 love to play then let's play 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.040
 thinkers thinkers this series of games 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.049
 consisting of fascinating tasks for 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.610
 answers that need flexibility and 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.710
 non-standard thinking they 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.890
 preliminary knowledge let's play 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:23.010
 the game is designed for all ages 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.039
 There are tasks for kids from 6 to 9 years 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.800
 for teenagers from 9 to 12 but also the 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.710
 Difficult option for anyone older than 12 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.660
 game set consists of one hundred cards on 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.770
 each card on one side 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.739
 contains tasks 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.989
 and on the reverse side the answer is in adult 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.410
 version of the game contains as many as two hundred 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.309
 ten tasks 6 different subjects task 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.289
 sprat games 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.239
 drawn up in such a way that 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.030
 train different types of thinking and 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.180
 divided into six categories logic 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.710
 development of logical thinking 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.649
 imagination development of imagination and 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.120
 ability to think by analogies 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:01.559
 spatial thinking finding 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.180
 optimal structure which 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.700
 satisfies the specified properties 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.200
 algorithm to determine the optimal 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.030
 action sequences 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.950
 reason definition 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.710
 causal relationships and skills 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.159
 predict humor ability to finish 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.650
 a joke 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.070
 each section has the same structure 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.390
 task distribution by complexity 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.250
 determine the complexity of the tasks can be 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.979
 the number of points given for 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.290
 right decision the easiest 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.810
 are the tasks for which is given 1 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.509
 score and the most difficult these patients 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.070
 thus, participants can play with 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.430
 different levels of development 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.380
 for example one man behaved quite 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.049
 strange when it rained 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.570
 he went up to his office by 40 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.759
 floor of a high-rise business center and when 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.700
 it was not raining then he took the elevator to 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.640
 25th floor and then climbed the stairs 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.189
 at 40 this man was not a sports fan 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.490
 and was not superstitious how to explain it 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.549
 strange behavior 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.979
 the game can be played alone or together 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:05.530
 large companies with large quantities 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.689
 wishing it is advisable to break into two 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.060
 three teams of two to five people in 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:11.890
 each during the game its members 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.440
 individual players or teams 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.519
 ask the answer to the tasks set out on 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.650
 one of the cards 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:19.540
 correctness of their answer they can 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.160
 check by comparing it with the reference 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.250
 answer on the back of the card 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.709
 only reference answer is correct 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.140
 If I give the right task 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.090
 member response or team receive 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:34.150
 the number of points indicated on the most 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.950
 Card game goal to score the maximum 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.420
 number of points during the game 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.170
 participant with maximum 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.330
 the amount becomes the winner of the game 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:46.450
 You can play 10 20 cards 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.730
 or the whole set at the request of the players if 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.190
 you are interested in the game, you thinkers 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.530
 You can order it online right now. 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.330
 ah kew tota point ru or buy online

 stores the right toys 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:05.920
 and now the correct answer 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.290
 this man was very short and 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.510
 could not reach buttons with number 40 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.480
 without help when did 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:17.250
 rain the man had zones that he could 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.250
 reach for the button of the fortieth floor
