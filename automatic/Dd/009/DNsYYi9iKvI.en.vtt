ya<00:00:57.470> what<00:00:58.010> exactly<00:00:58.760> is<00:00:59.060> a<00:00:59.420> stem<00:00:59.750> cell<00:01:00.020> so<00:01:00.560> stem

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:00.860 
ya what exactly is a stem cell so stem

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.620 
ya what exactly is a stem cell so stem
cells<00:01:01.160> are<00:01:01.310> these<00:01:01.460> precursor<00:01:02.120> cells<00:01:02.390> that

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:02.630 
cells are these precursor cells that

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.689 
cells are these precursor cells that
become<00:01:03.020> the<00:01:03.050> different<00:01:03.500> cells<00:01:03.800> and<00:01:04.070> organs

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
become the different cells and organs

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.819 
become the different cells and organs
and<00:01:04.820> the<00:01:05.059> tissue<00:01:05.299> of<00:01:05.600> our<00:01:06.049> body<00:01:06.259> that's<00:01:06.619> how<00:01:06.770> we

00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:06.829 
and the tissue of our body that's how we

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:09.340 
and the tissue of our body that's how we
formed<00:01:07.610> from<00:01:07.850> stem<00:01:08.119> cells<00:01:08.329> who<00:01:08.750> can<00:01:08.960> thank

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
formed from stem cells who can thank

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.170 
formed from stem cells who can thank
their<00:01:09.560> stem<00:01:09.770> cells<00:01:10.040> well<00:01:10.369> anyone<00:01:10.670> can<00:01:10.880> I<00:01:10.939> mean

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
their stem cells well anyone can I mean

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.940 
their stem cells well anyone can I mean
the<00:01:11.270> idea<00:01:11.360> is<00:01:11.630> to<00:01:11.689> do<00:01:11.899> before<00:01:12.350> you<00:01:12.500> get<00:01:12.680> sick

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
the idea is to do before you get sick

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.890 
the idea is to do before you get sick
and<00:01:13.640> taking<00:01:14.030> stem<00:01:14.300> cells<00:01:14.540> while<00:01:14.720> you're

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
and taking stem cells while you're

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.660 
and taking stem cells while you're
healthy<00:01:15.260> before<00:01:15.470> you<00:01:15.800> age<00:01:15.979> before<00:01:16.370> they

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
healthy before you age before they

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.430 
healthy before you age before they
become<00:01:16.940> less<00:01:17.180> than<00:01:17.210> quantity<00:01:17.810> and<00:01:17.930> quality<00:01:18.050> is

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
become less than quantity and quality is

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.780 
become less than quantity and quality is

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.240 
have to be cancer free you have to be
cancer<00:01:47.570> spread<00:01:47.900> free<00:01:48.229> so<00:01:48.710> if<00:01:48.770> someone<00:01:48.979> has<00:01:49.220> a

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
cancer spread free so if someone has a

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.520 
cancer spread free so if someone has a
solitary<00:01:49.940> tumor<00:01:50.390> like<00:01:50.869> a<00:01:50.900> small<00:01:51.229> breast

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
solitary tumor like a small breast

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:52.960 
solitary tumor like a small breast
cancer<00:01:51.920> you<00:01:52.040> could<00:01:52.190> have<00:01:52.369> your<00:01:52.490> stem<00:01:52.729> cells

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
cancer you could have your stem cells

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.820 
cancer you could have your stem cells
collected<00:01:53.390> before<00:01:53.540> it<00:01:53.810> spreads<00:01:54.110> I<00:01:54.350> was<00:01:54.680> so

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
collected before it spreads I was so

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.530 
collected before it spreads I was so
excited<00:01:55.250> when<00:01:55.280> I<00:01:55.430> did<00:01:55.700> it<00:01:55.820> because<00:01:55.909> I<00:01:56.060> do<00:01:56.180> see

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
excited when I did it because I do see

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.780 
excited when I did it because I do see
it<00:01:56.630> as<00:01:56.750> bio<00:01:57.020> insurance<00:01:57.619> that<00:01:57.920> if<00:01:58.460> down<00:01:58.760> the

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
it as bio insurance that if down the

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.300 
it as bio insurance that if down the
road<00:01:58.970> I<00:01:59.150> planned<00:01:59.510> a<00:01:59.600> little<00:01:59.630> own<00:01:59.930> time<00:02:00.500> and<00:02:00.830> if

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
road I planned a little own time and if

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.120 
road I planned a little own time and if
down<00:02:01.520> the<00:02:01.549> road<00:02:01.729> I<00:02:02.720> get<00:02:03.140> one<00:02:03.380> of<00:02:03.590> the<00:02:03.740> dreaded

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
down the road I get one of the dreaded

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.190 
down the road I get one of the dreaded
diseases<00:02:04.610> that<00:02:04.909> everyone<00:02:05.270> is<00:02:05.390> afraid<00:02:05.630> of<00:02:05.750> then

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
diseases that everyone is afraid of then

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.859 
diseases that everyone is afraid of then
I<00:02:06.409> would<00:02:06.710> have<00:02:06.740> my<00:02:07.460> stem<00:02:08.000> cells<00:02:08.269> banked<00:02:08.689> while

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
I would have my stem cells banked while

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.839 
I would have my stem cells banked while
I<00:02:08.899> was<00:02:09.170> healthy<00:02:09.379> and<00:02:09.679> so<00:02:10.099> what<00:02:10.310> you<00:02:10.459> removed

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:10.849 
I was healthy and so what you removed

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:13.210 
I was healthy and so what you removed
from<00:02:10.970> me<00:02:11.299> were<00:02:11.689> these<00:02:11.989> cells<00:02:12.439> explain<00:02:12.980> what

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
from me were these cells explain what

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.160 
from me were these cells explain what
that<00:02:13.250> is<00:02:13.610> we<00:02:14.180> took<00:02:14.390> a<00:02:14.510> snapshot<00:02:14.780> of<00:02:15.049> your

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
that is we took a snapshot of your

that is we took a snapshot of your
immune<00:02:15.500> system<00:02:15.739> and<00:02:16.069> there<00:02:16.159> were<00:02:16.250> many<00:02:16.489> cells

embryonic-like stem cells were they in

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.990 
embryonic-like stem cells were they in
me<00:02:29.840> when<00:02:29.989> I<00:02:30.050> was<00:02:30.260> a<00:02:30.290> baby<00:02:30.470> when<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.700> egg<00:02:31.819> and

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
me when I was a baby when the egg and

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.910 
me when I was a baby when the egg and
sperm<00:02:32.180> came<00:02:32.450> together<00:02:32.630> and<00:02:33.050> that<00:02:33.290> divided<00:02:33.830> and

sperm came together and that divided and

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.500 
sperm came together and that divided and
it<00:02:34.010> divided<00:02:34.400> again<00:02:34.640> and<00:02:34.849> divided<00:02:35.150> again<00:02:35.330> to

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
it divided again and divided again to

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.870 
it divided again and divided again to
become<00:02:35.840> Suzanne<00:02:36.260> you<00:02:36.440> have<00:02:37.069> stem<00:02:37.340> cells<00:02:37.640> that

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
become Suzanne you have stem cells that

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.030 
become Suzanne you have stem cells that

they're sitting in your bone marrow

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.630 
they're sitting in your bone marrow
there<00:02:44.900> in<00:02:44.989> your<00:02:45.080> body<00:02:45.319> and<00:02:45.560> God<00:02:46.099> forbid<00:02:46.340> you

there in your body and God forbid you

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.100 
there in your body and God forbid you
had<00:02:46.670> something<00:02:47.120> like<00:02:47.269> a<00:02:47.300> heart<00:02:47.599> attack<00:02:47.720> those

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
had something like a heart attack those

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:49.720 
had something like a heart attack those
cells<00:02:48.349> would<00:02:48.500> be<00:02:48.650> secreted<00:02:48.980> from<00:02:49.250> your<00:02:49.550> bone

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
cells would be secreted from your bone

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.850 
cells would be secreted from your bone
marrow<00:02:49.760> into<00:02:50.390> your<00:02:50.510> blood<00:02:50.720> to<00:02:51.200> try<00:02:51.440> and<00:02:51.590> go<00:02:51.709> and

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
marrow into your blood to try and go and

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.559 
marrow into your blood to try and go and
repair<00:02:52.190> the<00:02:52.370> areas<00:02:52.700> of<00:02:52.819> your<00:02:52.910> body<00:02:53.090> that<00:02:53.269> need

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
repair the areas of your body that need

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:56.380 
repair the areas of your body that need
fixing<00:02:54.280> but<00:02:55.280> there's<00:02:55.489> not<00:02:55.610> enough<00:02:55.880> quantities

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
fixing but there's not enough quantities

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:57.820 
fixing but there's not enough quantities
that<00:02:56.420> can<00:02:56.720> go<00:02:56.810> out<00:02:56.959> there<00:02:56.989> at<00:02:57.260> a<00:02:57.319> time<00:02:57.560> of<00:02:57.739> an

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
that can go out there at a time of an

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:59.710 
that can go out there at a time of an
injury<00:02:58.130> so<00:02:58.310> if<00:02:58.370> you<00:02:58.459> take<00:02:58.670> them<00:02:58.910> quantify<00:02:59.510> them

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
injury so if you take them quantify them

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.479 
injury so if you take them quantify them
purify<00:03:00.140> them<00:03:00.350> you<00:03:00.799> can<00:03:00.950> then<00:03:00.980> put<00:03:01.310> them<00:03:01.430> back

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
purify them you can then put them back

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.729 
purify them you can then put them back
in<00:03:01.850> in<00:03:02.060> times<00:03:02.299> of<00:03:02.450> injury<00:03:02.780> so<00:03:03.019> the<00:03:03.140> idea<00:03:03.260> is<00:03:03.500> how

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
in in times of injury so the idea is how

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.650 
in in times of injury so the idea is how
do<00:03:03.799> we<00:03:03.950> use<00:03:03.980> these<00:03:04.310> V<00:03:04.489> cells<00:03:04.760> to<00:03:04.940> repair<00:03:05.239> organs

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
do we use these V cells to repair organs

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.270 
do we use these V cells to repair organs
I<00:03:05.780> like<00:03:05.930> valves<00:03:06.410> it<00:03:06.530> could<00:03:06.680> be<00:03:06.799> wounds<00:03:07.010> and

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
I like valves it could be wounds and

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.670 
I like valves it could be wounds and
skin<00:03:07.610> it<00:03:07.730> could<00:03:07.880> be<00:03:08.030> your<00:03:08.150> retina<00:03:08.569> if<00:03:09.260> you<00:03:09.500> have

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
skin it could be your retina if you have

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.830 
skin it could be your retina if you have
issues<00:03:09.920> where<00:03:10.430> your<00:03:10.880> blindness<00:03:11.450> or<00:03:11.630> macular

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
issues where your blindness or macular

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.809 
issues where your blindness or macular
degeneration<00:03:12.170> so<00:03:12.920> we're<00:03:13.069> looking<00:03:13.280> to<00:03:13.640> create

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
degeneration so we're looking to create

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:15.910 
degeneration so we're looking to create
therapies<00:03:14.360> using<00:03:14.750> these<00:03:14.870> Wiesel's<00:03:15.319> when<00:03:15.799> you

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
therapies using these Wiesel's when you

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.259 
therapies using these Wiesel's when you
say<00:03:16.099> they<00:03:16.220> can<00:03:16.370> become<00:03:16.610> all<00:03:16.790> different<00:03:17.090> cell

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
say they can become all different cell

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:19.150 
say they can become all different cell
types<00:03:17.540> what<00:03:18.049> does<00:03:18.170> that<00:03:18.319> mean<00:03:18.560> it<00:03:18.799> means<00:03:18.860> that

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
types what does that mean it means that

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.100 
types what does that mean it means that
they<00:03:19.280> can<00:03:19.519> divide<00:03:19.940> into<00:03:20.299> the<00:03:20.510> cell<00:03:20.720> types<00:03:20.989> that

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
they can divide into the cell types that

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.750 
they can divide into the cell types that
you're<00:03:21.319> looking<00:03:21.590> for<00:03:21.799> so<00:03:22.010> you<00:03:22.069> can<00:03:22.310> take<00:03:22.549> a

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
you're looking for so you can take a

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.759 
you're looking for so you can take a
cell<00:03:23.299> and<00:03:23.510> say<00:03:23.720> okay<00:03:24.080> we<00:03:24.200> want<00:03:24.410> you<00:03:24.500> to<00:03:24.620> become

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
cell and say okay we want you to become

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.559 
cell and say okay we want you to become
heart<00:03:25.130> myself<00:03:25.489> and<00:03:25.640> you<00:03:25.910> put<00:03:26.150> it<00:03:26.269> in<00:03:26.450> the

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
heart myself and you put it in the

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:28.150 
heart myself and you put it in the
environment<00:03:26.870> of<00:03:27.200> the<00:03:27.290> heart<00:03:27.530> where<00:03:27.980> it's

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
environment of the heart where it's

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.130 
environment of the heart where it's
needed<00:03:28.370> to<00:03:28.640> lay<00:03:28.760> down<00:03:28.970> your<00:03:29.120> blood<00:03:29.329> vessels<00:03:29.359> or

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
needed to lay down your blood vessels or

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.199 
needed to lay down your blood vessels or
create<00:03:30.440> new<00:03:30.470> muscle<00:03:30.980> they<00:03:31.430> understand<00:03:32.000> from

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
create new muscle they understand from

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:33.490 
create new muscle they understand from
their<00:03:32.359> environment<00:03:32.480> what<00:03:33.109> they<00:03:33.260> should

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
their environment what they should

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.319 
their environment what they should
become<00:03:33.859> and<00:03:34.070> because<00:03:34.549> they're<00:03:34.730> your<00:03:34.880> own<00:03:35.030> your

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:35.329 
become and because they're your own your

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:37.300 
become and because they're your own your
body<00:03:35.480> recognizes<00:03:35.989> them<00:03:36.590> as<00:03:36.620> your<00:03:36.890> own<00:03:36.920> so

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
body recognizes them as your own so

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.340 
body recognizes them as your own so
you're<00:03:37.459> saying<00:03:37.730> that<00:03:37.820> our<00:03:38.090> stem<00:03:38.750> cells<00:03:39.019> RV

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
you're saying that our stem cells RV

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.860 
you're saying that our stem cells RV
cells<00:03:39.650> have<00:03:40.220> an<00:03:40.370> intelligence<00:03:40.940> your<00:03:41.450> cells

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
cells have an intelligence your cells

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.930 
cells have an intelligence your cells
have<00:03:42.350> an<00:03:42.470> intelligence<00:03:43.010> they<00:03:43.160> eat<00:03:43.370> it's<00:03:43.640> part

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:43.940 
have an intelligence they eat it's part

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.789 
have an intelligence they eat it's part
of<00:03:44.030> your<00:03:44.090> repair<00:03:44.569> mechanism<00:03:45.170> so<00:03:45.440> let's<00:03:45.590> walk

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
of your repair mechanism so let's walk

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.970 
of your repair mechanism so let's walk
through<00:03:46.150> exactly<00:03:47.150> what<00:03:47.390> the<00:03:47.750> procedure<00:03:48.200> is<00:03:48.380> as

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
through exactly what the procedure is as

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.270 
through exactly what the procedure is as
I<00:03:49.519> said<00:03:49.579> it<00:03:49.970> was<00:03:50.120> boring<00:03:50.569> lying<00:03:51.170> there<00:03:51.440> I<00:03:51.650> had

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
I said it was boring lying there I had

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.940 
I said it was boring lying there I had
an<00:03:52.400> IV<00:03:52.760> in<00:03:52.880> each<00:03:53.030> arm<00:03:53.269> what<00:03:53.900> was<00:03:54.079> going<00:03:54.380> on<00:03:54.500> yeah

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
an IV in each arm what was going on yeah

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.259 
an IV in each arm what was going on yeah
so<00:03:55.130> it's<00:03:55.250> very<00:03:55.430> similar<00:03:55.730> to<00:03:55.850> donating

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
so it's very similar to donating

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.300 
so it's very similar to donating
platelets<00:03:56.540> you<00:03:56.959> had<00:03:57.200> one<00:03:57.650> area<00:03:58.040> where<00:03:58.160> the

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
platelets you had one area where the

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:59.740 
platelets you had one area where the
blood<00:03:58.519> was<00:03:58.549> coming<00:03:58.850> out<00:03:59.120> of<00:03:59.180> you<00:03:59.389> into<00:03:59.660> the

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
blood was coming out of you into the

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.780 
blood was coming out of you into the
machine<00:04:00.079> to<00:04:00.560> pull<00:04:00.739> out<00:04:00.920> the<00:04:00.950> stem<00:04:01.310> cells<00:04:01.579> and

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
machine to pull out the stem cells and

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.699 
machine to pull out the stem cells and
then<00:04:02.090> the<00:04:02.180> blood<00:04:02.329> was<00:04:02.510> returned<00:04:03.170> right<00:04:03.440> into

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
then the blood was returned right into

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:05.590 
then the blood was returned right into
your<00:04:03.829> system<00:04:04.250> so<00:04:04.549> it's<00:04:04.880> not<00:04:05.090> like<00:04:05.269> sharing

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
your system so it's not like sharing

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.090 
your system so it's not like sharing
needles<00:04:05.720> you<00:04:06.049> don't<00:04:06.200> share<00:04:06.440> the<00:04:06.620> blood<00:04:06.829> it's<00:04:07.010> a

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
needles you don't share the blood it's a

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.640 
needles you don't share the blood it's a
very<00:04:07.310> clean<00:04:07.639> system<00:04:07.940> that<00:04:08.600> protects<00:04:09.230> you<00:04:09.440> so

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
very clean system that protects you so

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.009 
very clean system that protects you so
that<00:04:09.799> your<00:04:09.920> blood<00:04:10.130> is<00:04:10.340> basically<00:04:10.850> filtered<00:04:11.269> so

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
that your blood is basically filtered so

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:14.259 
that your blood is basically filtered so
now<00:04:12.200> these<00:04:12.680> are<00:04:12.859> put<00:04:13.100> into<00:04:13.250> little<00:04:13.730> bags

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269 
now these are put into little bags

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:16.569 
now these are put into little bags
that's<00:04:15.200> right<00:04:15.380> there<00:04:15.590> cryopreserve<00:04:16.310> and

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
that's right there cryopreserve and

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.180 
that's right there cryopreserve and
there<00:04:17.060> they're<00:04:17.269> frozen<00:04:17.870> if<00:04:18.260> you<00:04:18.380> will<00:04:18.530> for<00:04:19.070> you

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
there they're frozen if you will for you

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.840 
there they're frozen if you will for you
for<00:04:19.430> your<00:04:19.549> future<00:04:19.870> cryopreserved<00:04:20.870> means<00:04:21.169> a

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
for your future cryopreserved means a

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.940 
for your future cryopreserved means a
super<00:04:22.850> frozen<00:04:23.240> super<00:04:23.479> further<00:04:23.690> okay<00:04:24.650> they're

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
super frozen super further okay they're

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.500 
super frozen super further okay they're
your<00:04:25.160> cell<00:04:25.460> and<00:04:25.639> they're<00:04:25.820> well<00:04:26.000> and<00:04:26.180> alive<00:04:26.300> and

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
your cell and they're well and alive and

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:27.730 
your cell and they're well and alive and
they're<00:04:26.840> there<00:04:26.990> for<00:04:27.020> you<00:04:27.260> for<00:04:27.440> your<00:04:27.560> future

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
they're there for you for your future

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:28.870 
they're there for you for your future
when<00:04:28.039> you<00:04:28.160> need<00:04:28.310> them<00:04:28.460> and<00:04:28.669> there<00:04:28.789> are

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
when you need them and there are

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.820 
when you need them and there are
different<00:04:29.240> packages<00:04:29.900> so<00:04:30.380> that<00:04:30.560> once<00:04:30.740> you

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
different packages so that once you

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.409 
different packages so that once you
defrost<00:04:31.220> them<00:04:31.400> it's<00:04:31.580> like<00:04:31.669> a<00:04:31.729> TV<00:04:32.060> dinner<00:04:32.210> you

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419 
defrost them it's like a TV dinner you

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:34.420 
defrost them it's like a TV dinner you
can't<00:04:32.659> refreeze<00:04:33.020> so<00:04:33.560> we<00:04:33.710> have<00:04:33.860> them<00:04:34.039> in<00:04:34.159> small

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
can't refreeze so we have them in small

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.040 
can't refreeze so we have them in small
aliquot<00:04:35.060> so<00:04:35.270> that<00:04:35.419> if<00:04:35.510> you<00:04:35.599> only<00:04:35.720> need<00:04:35.930> a<00:04:35.960> few

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
aliquot so that if you only need a few

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.999 
aliquot so that if you only need a few
cells<00:04:36.440> for

00:04:36.999 --> 00:04:37.009 
cells for

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:38.589 
cells for
gillich<00:04:37.219> treatment<00:04:37.580> you're<00:04:37.909> not<00:04:38.059> defrosting

00:04:38.589 --> 00:04:38.599 
gillich treatment you're not defrosting

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:40.359 
gillich treatment you're not defrosting
all<00:04:38.719> of<00:04:38.839> your<00:04:38.930> cells<00:04:39.169> and<00:04:39.499> then<00:04:39.740> you<00:04:39.860> have<00:04:39.979> 48

00:04:40.359 --> 00:04:40.369 
all of your cells and then you have 48

00:04:40.369 --> 00:04:42.609 
all of your cells and then you have 48
hours<00:04:40.490> once<00:04:40.849> they're<00:04:41.059> defrosted<00:04:41.599> 48<00:04:41.930> them<00:04:42.080> now

00:04:42.609 --> 00:04:42.619 
hours once they're defrosted 48 them now

00:04:42.619 --> 00:04:45.309 
hours once they're defrosted 48 them now
you've<00:04:43.009> taken<00:04:43.249> all<00:04:43.699> these<00:04:43.909> these<00:04:44.809> cells<00:04:45.080> out

00:04:45.309 --> 00:04:45.319 
you've taken all these these cells out

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:47.859 
you've taken all these these cells out
of<00:04:45.499> me<00:04:45.710> what<00:04:46.039> 20<00:04:46.339> vials<00:04:46.520> did<00:04:46.789> you<00:04:47.029> say<00:04:47.210> we've

00:04:47.859 --> 00:04:47.869 
of me what 20 vials did you say we've

00:04:47.869 --> 00:04:49.719 
of me what 20 vials did you say we've
taken<00:04:48.110> 20<00:04:48.589> vials<00:04:48.740> of<00:04:48.949> your<00:04:49.219> stem<00:04:49.490> cells

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:49.729

demystifies the whole embryonic
discussion<00:05:00.889> correct<00:05:01.339> there's<00:05:02.240> a<00:05:02.330> lot<00:05:02.599> of

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:02.649 
discussion correct there's a lot of

00:05:02.649 --> 00:05:04.779 
discussion correct there's a lot of
misunderstanding<00:05:03.649> what<00:05:04.219> the<00:05:04.339> difference<00:05:04.669> is

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:04.789

between<00:05:04.849> embryonic<00:05:05.629> and<00:05:05.689> adult<00:05:05.809> stem<00:05:06.199> cell

00:05:06.489 --> 00:05:06.499 
between embryonic and adult stem cell

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:08.529 
between embryonic and adult stem cell
you're<00:05:06.800> right<00:05:06.979> these<00:05:07.490> cells<00:05:07.759> are<00:05:07.879> very<00:05:08.240> small

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:08.539 
you're right these cells are very small

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:10.329 
you're right these cells are very small
embryonic-like<00:05:09.050> but<00:05:09.680> they're<00:05:09.830> adult<00:05:10.129> stem

00:05:10.329 --> 00:05:10.339 
embryonic-like but they're adult stem

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:12.040 
embryonic-like but they're adult stem
cells<00:05:10.639> so<00:05:10.819> you<00:05:10.909> don't<00:05:11.089> have<00:05:11.270> the<00:05:11.389> controversy

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:12.050 
cells so you don't have the controversy

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:13.510 
cells so you don't have the controversy
and<00:05:12.169> I<00:05:12.199> think<00:05:12.409> what<00:05:12.559> we<00:05:12.680> need<00:05:12.710> to<00:05:13.009> do<00:05:13.189> is<00:05:13.339> better

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
and I think what we need to do is better

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.760 
and I think what we need to do is better
understand<00:05:14.089> all<00:05:14.330> the<00:05:14.509> promise<00:05:14.960> all<00:05:15.110> the

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:17.659 
therapies that currently use adult stem

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:19.659 
therapies that currently use adult stem
cells<00:05:17.960> so<00:05:18.499> that<00:05:18.529> people<00:05:18.949> understand<00:05:19.490> there<00:05:19.639> is

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:19.669 
cells so that people understand there is

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:21.610 
cells so that people understand there is
no<00:05:19.849> controversy<00:05:20.240> and<00:05:20.749> there<00:05:21.110> are<00:05:21.199> therapies

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
no controversy and there are therapies

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:22.749 
no controversy and there are therapies
out<00:05:21.770> there<00:05:21.979> and<00:05:22.129> there's<00:05:22.249> a<00:05:22.309> lot<00:05:22.460> of<00:05:22.490> hope<00:05:22.729> for

00:05:24.999 --> 00:05:25.009 
our future it feels not only that it's

our future it feels not only that it's
the<00:05:25.159> future<00:05:25.520> but<00:05:25.669> it's<00:05:25.729> also<00:05:25.999> the<00:05:26.539> present<00:05:26.990> I'm

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:27.169 
the future but it's also the present I'm

the future but it's also the present I'm
so<00:05:27.469> glad<00:05:27.620> that<00:05:27.889> I<00:05:27.919> have<00:05:28.189> mine<00:05:28.459> banked<00:05:28.879> it

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:29.149 
so glad that I have mine banked it

00:05:29.149 --> 00:05:32.230 
so glad that I have mine banked it
allows<00:05:29.419> me<00:05:29.449> to<00:05:30.069> not<00:05:31.069> worry<00:05:31.550> about<00:05:31.729> the

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
allows me to not worry about the

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.999 
allows me to not worry about the
diseases<00:05:32.629> that<00:05:34.839> everybody<00:05:35.839> is<00:05:36.229> afraid<00:05:36.889> of

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:37.009 
diseases that everybody is afraid of
