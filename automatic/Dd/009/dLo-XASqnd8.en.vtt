00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.080
 I think it was here we are in a new 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:16.869
 video where we will see the game mode 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.970
 called black market fighters al 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:21.130
 less that would be his translation in the absence of 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.869
 the official the description of riot that 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.239
 sums up very well the game says what 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.579
 next buy objects from the market 

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:29.349
 illegal black and uses crack gold ens for 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:31.480
 recruit new wrestling subjects 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:33.579
 while you seek to master the crack of 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.590
 invoker as they comment already simple 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:37.270
 sight is totally true it's about 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.290
 more complex game mode until the 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.210
 date 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.910
 next we will review each and every 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.219
 one of the characteristics starting with 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.899
 the golden crackers the special currency 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:49.149
 for the game they serve to pay 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:51.100
 contracts and improve four types of 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:53.469
 mercenaries that we will analyze later 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.960
 crackers gold can be achieved 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:58.600
 in different ways with each murder 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.460
 we get two crack in we'll get 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.980
 a crack in if we get an existence 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.720
 if we defeat the dragon or the baron and if 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.060
 we do with jungle ter defeating a 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.180
 big monster also every 60 seconds 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.340
 we get a crack in these coins the 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.170
 we get individually and with 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.860
 we can pay four types of 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.780
 wrestlers 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.730
 scenarios to fight with us 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.010
 these fighters will replace a 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.770
 subject of each line and we can buy 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.540
 only one per game is to say in a 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.970
 starting we will see a total of 5 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.190
 mercenaries per team limited to one 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.110
 for each player once chosen the 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.180
 mercenary we can raise your level to 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.610
 improve their characteristics and make 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.530
 receive new skills to rise from 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.300
 level to the four types of mercenaries 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.180
 we have to buy the level improvement 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:46.060
 in the store level 1 will cost 5 cracks 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.490
 Gold 10 crack on level 2 and level 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.860
 3 will cost a total of 20 gold cracks 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.020
 we started analyzing behind the back of 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.270
 steel a melee fighter that 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.280
 has the siege tank function for 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.229
 the five gold cracks we will make this 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.899
 mercenary appears in each of the 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.840
 three lines also has a passive 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:07.180
 which reduces by 25% the damage received by 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.179
 enemy turrets with the first level 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.739
 bought steel back causes 175 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.410
 percent damage against structures 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:16.450
 enemies and gets a shield that blocks 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.570
 the next basic attack of a champion 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.550
 or turret with the second level causes 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:23.290
 250 percent damage against structure 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.410
 enemies and while the shield is 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:30.520
 Active suffers 35% reduced damage from 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:32.500
 minions at level 3 causes 325 damage 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.390
 against enemy structures 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.390
 in addition the cooling of the shield is 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.150
 reduces to 3 seconds and now suffers 60% 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.230
 of reduced damage of the subjects 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.870
 we continue with the next fighter 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.730
 called reason end is a body fighter 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.220
 to body that has 100% of 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.050
 additional attack speed at level 1 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.240
 when aiming at a champion 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.700
 enemy will pursue him constantly 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.890
 while attacking enemy champions the 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.080
 racing has 100% speed of 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.570
 increased movement and ignores 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.700
 collisions of units with level 2 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.490
 every time our end reason hits 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.980
 an enemy champion applies a mark to the 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:11.380
 Third brand causes 300% damage 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.190
 against the objective finally at level 3 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.540
 we generate 2 racing for each wave 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:19.360
 we continue with the third mercenary 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.950
 crab looter fighter at a distance 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.950
 that shoots an additional shot at a 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:26.709
 close champion with 150 rank points 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.600
 Attack but with 50% of the damage 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.330
 when we go up to this 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.070
 level 1 gets 50 rank points of 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.650
 attack and has a better 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:38.680
 cumulative 20% speed of 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.420
 attack up to a total of 150 by 3 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.120
 seconds every time it hits a 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:46.480
 enemy champion at level 2 his range of 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.610
 attack increases 100 points and causes 150% 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.700
 of damage when hitting enemy champions 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.920
 finally at level 3 150 of range of 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.020
 attack and blow bonuses 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.450
 now they are also applied when hitting 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.910
 enemy minions also shoots a shot 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.550
 additional to all enemy champions 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:06.070
 next, finally, let's see the sockets 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:08.320
 a mercenary at a distance with the role of 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.630
 support has an initial ability 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.550
 like the rest of the mercenaries in this 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.100
 case will throw a magic shield at a 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:17.200
 Allied subject every 10 seconds 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:19.750
 blocking 80 shield damage 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.940
 lasts 10 seconds when you upload it to level 1 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.890
 our that the pod receives 10 points of 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.630
 magic resistance and invokes a 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:28.360
 walking clairvoyance every 30 seconds 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:30.550
 after a wait of four seconds 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.770
 grants vision of a nearby area that 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.650
 it lasts another four seconds at level 2 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:38.889
 get 20 magic resistance points 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.720
 now blocks 150 damage plus one 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:43.000
 for each attack damage of what the pod 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:45.190
 at level 3 you get 30 points of 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.440
 magic resistance clairvoyance 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.110
 now it is invoked every 10 seconds and the 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.850
 revelation is reduced to two seconds the 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.490
 duration and distance traveled because the 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:57.220
 evidence increases by 50% 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.080
 now the shield blocks 300 more points 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.360
 a point of attack damage of what the 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.160
 bot and these would be the four types of 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:05.199
 mercenaries but there's still more because 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.360
 these fighters can be improved 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:09.370
 with defense or attack if you want 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.400
 increase your defense we can buy 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:14.590
 these improvements at level 1 by 5 cracks of 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.169
 gold our fighter has 100 points of 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:20.260

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:23.020
 300 points and at level 30 for 20 karak in 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:25.060

 same price we can increase your attack 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:31.120
 obtaining 10 points at level 120 at the level 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:33.039
 2 and 30 at level 3 the best way to 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.020
