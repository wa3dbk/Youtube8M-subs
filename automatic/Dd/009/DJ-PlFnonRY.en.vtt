fry the vegetables in some butter for a
few<00:02:24.319> minutes<00:02:24.560> not<00:02:25.069> to<00:02:25.220> cook<00:02:25.370> it<00:02:25.549> so<00:02:25.700> just<00:02:26.799> give

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799 
few minutes not to cook it so just give

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:31.120 
few minutes not to cook it so just give
it<00:02:27.860> a<00:02:27.920> bit<00:02:28.040> of<00:02:28.160> flavor<00:02:28.430> I<00:02:28.610> guess

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.800 

and<00:02:32.049> I<00:02:33.049> added<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.410> garlic<00:02:34.569> because<00:02:35.569> I<00:02:35.630> add

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
and I added the garlic because I add

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:43.570 
and I added the garlic because I add
garlic<00:02:36.019> to<00:02:36.200> everything

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.350 

so<00:02:44.360> I<00:02:45.250> fried<00:02:46.250> the<00:02:46.430> vegetables<00:02:46.850> for<00:02:46.940> about<00:02:47.120> five

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
so I fried the vegetables for about five

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.380 
so I fried the vegetables for about five
minutes<00:02:47.600> and<00:02:47.900> I've<00:02:48.740> now<00:02:48.950> added<00:02:48.980> it<00:02:49.370> back<00:02:49.940> and

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
minutes and I've now added it back and

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.470 
minutes and I've now added it back and
if<00:02:50.450> you<00:02:50.540> can<00:02:50.660> see<00:02:50.840> that<00:02:51.050> back<00:02:51.770> into<00:02:52.480> basically

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
if you can see that back into basically

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.960 
if you can see that back into basically
the<00:02:53.720> stock<00:02:53.960> with<00:02:54.470> the<00:02:54.650> chicken<00:02:54.980> pieces<00:02:55.220> the

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
the stock with the chicken pieces the

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.550
