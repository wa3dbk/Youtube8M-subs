00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
picture is up to you I'm going to split

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.620 
picture is up to you I'm going to split
it<00:00:35.250> in<00:00:35.399> two<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.700> show<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:35.910> how<00:00:36.180> you<00:00:36.239> can<00:00:36.360> do

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
it in two and show you how you can do

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.540 
it in two and show you how you can do
two<00:00:36.899> different<00:00:37.050> frames<00:00:37.590> but<00:00:38.129> this<00:00:38.250> is<00:00:38.399> also

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
two different frames but this is also

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.639 
two different frames but this is also
great<00:00:38.969> for<00:00:39.210> making<00:00:39.360> smaller<00:00:39.870> pieces<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.410> art

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
great for making smaller pieces of art

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.380 
great for making smaller pieces of art
and<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:41.370> really<00:00:41.640> helps<00:00:41.910> in<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.059> childcare

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
and it really helps in a childcare

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.760 
and it really helps in a childcare
setting<00:00:42.840> because<00:00:42.989> you're<00:00:43.230> getting<00:00:43.440> twice<00:00:43.739> the

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
setting because you're getting twice the

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.190 
setting because you're getting twice the
amount<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.160> art<00:00:44.370> for<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.270> same<00:00:45.870> amount<00:00:45.989> of

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
amount of art for the same amount of

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.560 
amount of art for the same amount of
resources<00:00:47.000> now<00:00:48.000> you're<00:00:48.120> going<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.300> measure

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
resources now you're going to measure

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.510 
resources now you're going to measure
off<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.870> border<00:00:49.170> I've<00:00:49.350> chosen<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:50.010> keep<00:00:50.340> it

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
off the border I've chosen to keep it

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.369 
off the border I've chosen to keep it
the<00:00:50.610> size<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.180> raw<00:00:51.360> and<00:00:51.750> this<00:00:51.899> creates<00:00:52.289> a

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
the size of the raw and this creates a

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.920 
the size of the raw and this creates a
very<00:00:52.559> dominant<00:00:52.829> border<00:00:53.489> with<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.480> smaller

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
very dominant border with the smaller

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.600 
very dominant border with the smaller
thin<00:00:55.350> one<00:00:55.620> you're<00:00:55.829> going<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.010> get<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.219> bigger

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
thin one you're going to get a bigger

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.029 
thin one you're going to get a bigger

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
out you're going to flip it over and on

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.190 
out you're going to flip it over and on
the<00:01:47.610> paper<00:01:47.850> side<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.390> contact<00:01:48.840> you're

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
the paper side of the contact you're

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.859 
the paper side of the contact you're
going<00:01:49.380> to<00:01:49.530> trace<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:50.100> inner<00:01:50.340> border<00:01:50.790> of<00:01:50.970> your

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
going to trace the inner border of your

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.859 
going to trace the inner border of your
frame<00:01:52.740> this<00:01:53.670> is<00:01:53.880> going<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.240> give<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.509> an<00:01:54.659> idea

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
frame this is going to give you an idea

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.980 
frame this is going to give you an idea
where<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.890> put<00:01:56.250> your<00:01:56.549> drawing<00:01:57.479> on<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.689> back

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
where to put your drawing on the back

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.690 
where to put your drawing on the back
but<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.770> reason<00:01:58.950> you're<00:01:59.189> drawing<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.549> on<00:01:59.579> the

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
but the reason you're drawing it on the

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.069 
but the reason you're drawing it on the
paper<00:01:59.909> is<00:02:00.119> because<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:00.420> don't<00:02:00.600> want<00:02:00.659> that<00:02:00.899> to

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
paper is because you don't want that to

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.499 
paper is because you don't want that to
stay<00:02:01.320> there<00:02:01.590> when<00:02:02.130> you<00:02:02.219> remove<00:02:02.579> it<00:02:02.700> you<00:02:03.329> won't

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
stay there when you remove it you won't

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.340 
stay there when you remove it you won't
see<00:02:03.719> that<00:02:03.899> square<00:02:04.380> anymore

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
see that square anymore

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.289 
see that square anymore
so<00:02:06.100> on<00:02:06.250> the<00:02:06.369> plastic<00:02:06.729> side<00:02:06.939> you're<00:02:07.119> going<00:02:07.150> to

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 
so on the plastic side you're going to

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:09.150 
so on the plastic side you're going to
draw<00:02:07.479> your<00:02:07.630> picture<00:02:07.810> I've<00:02:08.140> chosen<00:02:08.590> to<00:02:08.800> draw<00:02:09.130> a
