and today I'm going to show you how to

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.680 
and today I'm going to show you how to
mount<00:00:04.980> the<00:00:05.130> stairway<00:00:05.490> special<00:00:05.940> to<00:00:06.299> a<00:00:06.330> banister

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.080 
mount the stairway special to a banister
we<00:00:07.470> get<00:00:07.620> this<00:00:07.740> request<00:00:08.160> a<00:00:08.309> lot<00:00:08.519> because<00:00:08.790> this

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
we get this request a lot because this

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.450 
we get this request a lot because this
gate<00:00:09.300> is<00:00:09.679> fantastic<00:00:10.679> for<00:00:10.830> top<00:00:11.010> of<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.190> stairs

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
gate is fantastic for top of the stairs

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.730 
gate is fantastic for top of the stairs
but<00:00:11.670> a<00:00:11.730> lot<00:00:11.880> of<00:00:11.910> people<00:00:12.179> have<00:00:12.330> a<00:00:12.360> post<00:00:12.719> and<00:00:13.410> they

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
say well how am I supposed to mount my

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.810 
say well how am I supposed to mount my
gate<00:00:15.599> to<00:00:16.350> a<00:00:16.379> post<00:00:16.710> that's<00:00:17.010> got<00:00:17.190> a<00:00:17.220> round<00:00:17.490> part

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
gate to a post that's got a round part

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.390 
gate to a post that's got a round part
and<00:00:18.359> a<00:00:18.480> square<00:00:18.750> part<00:00:19.050> well<00:00:19.740> our<00:00:19.890> solution<00:00:20.310> of

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
and a square part well our solution of

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.269 
and a square part well our solution of
that<00:00:20.550> are<00:00:20.820> our<00:00:21.539> clamps<00:00:21.990> we<00:00:22.350> have<00:00:22.529> round<00:00:22.830> clamps

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
that are our clamps we have round clamps

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.210 
that are our clamps we have round clamps
and<00:00:23.490> we<00:00:23.699> have<00:00:23.850> square<00:00:24.090> clamps<00:00:24.980> there's<00:00:25.980> really

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
and we have square clamps there's really

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.060 
and we have square clamps there's really
only<00:00:26.960> there's<00:00:27.960> two<00:00:28.140> sides<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.619> gate<00:00:28.830> there's

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
only there's two sides to a gate there's

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.040 
only there's two sides to a gate there's
a<00:00:29.160> hinge<00:00:29.340> side<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:30.240> there's<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.570> latch<00:00:30.720> side

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
a hinge side and there's a latch side

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.450 
a hinge side and there's a latch side
and<00:00:31.920> there's<00:00:32.130> really<00:00:32.340> only<00:00:32.489> four<00:00:33.140> points<00:00:34.460> that

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
and there's really only four points that

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.900 
and there's really only four points that
the<00:00:35.610> gate<00:00:35.790> is<00:00:36.059> screwed<00:00:36.360> into<00:00:36.630> either<00:00:37.410> a<00:00:37.530> wall

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
the gate is screwed into either a wall

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.470 
the gate is screwed into either a wall
or<00:00:38.910> banister<00:00:39.390> post<00:00:39.739> so<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:42.120> way<00:00:42.239> the

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
or banister post so the the way the

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.270 
or banister post so the the way the
easiest<00:00:42.750> way<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:42.960> start<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.410> won't<00:00:43.829> take<00:00:44.100> each

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
easiest way to start is won't take each

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.369 
easiest way to start is won't take each
side<00:00:44.610> because<00:00:45.539> some<00:00:45.719> people<00:00:45.960> might<00:00:46.110> have<00:00:46.260> to

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
side because some people might have to

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.420 
side because some people might have to
mount<00:00:46.649> post<00:00:47.129> a<00:00:47.250> post<00:00:47.489> some<00:00:47.910> do<00:00:48.059> post<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.480> wall

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:49.430 
mount post a post some do post a wall

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.619 
mount post a post some do post a wall
some<00:00:50.430> might<00:00:50.610> put<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.879> hinge<00:00:51.090> on<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.270> wall<00:00:51.420> the

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
some might put the hinge on the wall the

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.020 
some might put the hinge on the wall the
latch<00:00:51.809> on<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.140> post<00:00:52.379> vice<00:00:52.949> versa<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:53.699> we'll<00:00:53.879> go

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
latch on the post vice versa so we'll go

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.850 
latch on the post vice versa so we'll go
through<00:00:54.239> those<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.989> show<00:00:55.199> you<00:00:55.289> how<00:00:55.440> easy<00:00:55.649> it

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
through those and show you how easy it

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.510 
through those and show you how easy it
is<00:00:56.239> the<00:00:57.239> hinge<00:00:57.480> bracket<00:00:58.129> this<00:00:59.129> is<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.399> way

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
is the hinge bracket this is the way

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.040 
is the hinge bracket this is the way
that<00:00:59.699> you<00:00:59.820> start<00:00:59.879> mounting<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.420> gate<00:01:00.629> always

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
that you start mounting the gate always

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.049 
that you start mounting the gate always
anyway<00:01:01.500> even<00:01:01.739> if<00:01:01.859> you're<00:01:02.010> on<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.160> wall<00:01:02.430> this

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
anyway even if you're on a wall this

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.080 
anyway even if you're on a wall this
lower<00:01:03.480> hole<00:01:04.229> should<00:01:05.159> be<00:01:05.339> six<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.060> half

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
lower hole should be six and a half

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.289 
lower hole should be six and a half
inches<00:01:06.600> off<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.869> floor<00:01:07.909> and<00:01:08.909> in<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.119> vast

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
inches off the floor and in the vast

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.450 
inches off the floor and in the vast
majority<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.869> post<00:01:12.080> post<00:01:13.080> mounts<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:14.159> six

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
majority of post post mounts that six

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.940 
majority of post post mounts that six
inches<00:01:14.729> will<00:01:14.909> almost<00:01:15.180> always<00:01:15.540> be<00:01:15.900> square<00:01:16.229> so

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
inches will almost always be square so

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.710 
inches will almost always be square so
if<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.070> just<00:01:17.220> take<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.430> tape<00:01:17.670> that's<00:01:18.330> my<00:01:18.509> mark

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
if you just take a tape that's my mark

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.030 
if you just take a tape that's my mark
they're<00:01:18.930> at<00:01:19.049> six<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.409> half<00:01:19.439> inches<00:01:19.830> off<00:01:20.009> the

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
they're at six and a half inches off the

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.640 
they're at six and a half inches off the
floor<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:21.119> can<00:01:21.270> see<00:01:21.420> it's<00:01:21.570> square<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:22.470> that's

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
floor you can see it's square so that's

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.590 
floor you can see it's square so that's
where<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.860> first<00:01:23.100> screw<00:01:23.400> goes<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:24.330> mount<00:01:24.509> the

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
where the first screw goes to mount the

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.460 
where the first screw goes to mount the
hinge<00:01:24.780> bracket<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.650> post<00:01:25.939> so<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:26.970> simply

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
hinge bracket to the post so you simply

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:35.770 
hinge bracket to the post so you simply
take<00:01:29.390> the<00:01:30.390> square<00:01:30.420> clamp<00:01:34.280> mount<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.400> around

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
take the square clamp mount it around

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.380 
take the square clamp mount it around
make<00:01:36.780> sure<00:01:36.930> that<00:01:37.079> these<00:01:37.590> are<00:01:37.710> called<00:01:37.890> T<00:01:38.070> nuts

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
make sure that these are called T nuts

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.280 
make sure that these are called T nuts
that<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.990> flanges<00:01:40.380> are<00:01:40.530> on<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.650> outside

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
that the the flanges are on the outside

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:48.200 
that the the flanges are on the outside
and<00:01:43.290> then<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:43.590> just<00:01:43.920> can<00:01:44.729> tighten<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.240> like<00:01:47.210> I

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
and then you just can tighten it like I

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.960 
and then you just can tighten it like I
said<00:01:48.270> this<00:01:48.600> should<00:01:48.810> be<00:01:49.430> about<00:01:50.430> six<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:50.939> half

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
said this should be about six and a half

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.210 
said this should be about six and a half
inches<00:01:51.390> off<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.720> floor<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.500> do<00:01:52.680> have<00:01:52.950> some

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
inches off the floor you do have some

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.460 
inches off the floor you do have some
wiggle<00:01:54.210> room<00:01:54.360> with<00:01:54.659> this<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:55.049> can<00:01:55.200> mount<00:01:55.350> it

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
wiggle room with this you can mount it

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.859 
wiggle room with this you can mount it
up<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.799> little<00:01:55.950> bit<00:01:56.159> maybe<00:01:56.520> half<00:01:56.729> inch<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.750> an

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
up a little bit maybe half inch to an

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
what this does it makes the gate so that

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.300 
what this does it makes the gate so that
it's<00:02:04.200> less<00:02:04.380> than<00:02:04.560> three<00:02:04.770> inches<00:02:05.100> off<00:02:05.280> the

at this six and a half inch height which

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.450 
at this six and a half inch height which
is<00:02:08.550> what<00:02:08.940> you<00:02:09.390> really<00:02:09.569> need<00:02:09.780> to

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
is what you really need to

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.250 
is what you really need to
be<00:02:10.640> aware<00:02:10.880> of<00:02:10.940> does<00:02:11.750> you<00:02:11.810> don't<00:02:11.870> want<00:02:12.050> anyone

crawling<00:02:12.590> under<00:02:12.800> the<00:02:12.890> gate<00:02:13.070> obviously<00:02:13.580> so

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
crawling under the gate obviously so

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.060 
crawling under the gate obviously so
that's<00:02:14.630> six<00:02:14.840> and<00:02:14.870> a<00:02:14.960> half<00:02:15.020> inch<00:02:15.320> point<00:02:15.620> about

that's six and a half inch point about

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.750 
that's six and a half inch point about
right<00:02:16.280> there

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
right there

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.640 
right there
tighten<00:02:17.750> it<00:02:17.840> down<00:02:17.870> I'm<00:02:18.170> just<00:02:18.200> gonna<00:02:18.410> do<00:02:18.560> this

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
tighten it down I'm just gonna do this

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.130 
tighten it down I'm just gonna do this
by<00:02:18.830> hand<00:02:19.100> you<00:02:19.430> want<00:02:19.940> to<00:02:20.000> do<00:02:20.120> that<00:02:20.300> use<00:02:20.810> a<00:02:20.840> socket

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
by hand you want to do that use a socket

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.050 
by hand you want to do that use a socket
wrench<00:02:21.260> or<00:02:22.040> an<00:02:22.130> adjustable<00:02:22.550> wrench<00:02:22.700> to

wrench or an adjustable wrench to
tighten<00:02:23.210> that<00:02:23.620> fully<00:02:24.620> in<00:02:24.800> place<00:02:24.830> layer<00:02:25.340> it

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
tighten that fully in place layer it

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:34.390 
tighten that fully in place layer it
later<00:02:31.450> second<00:02:32.450> point<00:02:32.690> so<00:02:32.990> then<00:02:33.830> what<00:02:34.100> happens

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
later second point so then what happens

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.040 
later second point so then what happens
is<00:02:34.550> this<00:02:34.670> gets<00:02:34.910> screwed<00:02:35.150> into<00:02:35.330> here<00:02:35.570> the

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
is this gets screwed into here the

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.990 
is this gets screwed into here the
second<00:02:36.410> point<00:02:36.560> is<00:02:36.740> about<00:02:36.770> 28<00:02:37.460> inches<00:02:37.490> off<00:02:37.970> the

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
second point is about 28 inches off the

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.810 
second point is about 28 inches off the
floor<00:02:38.800> we're<00:02:39.800> measuring<00:02:39.980> from<00:02:40.280> the<00:02:40.370> floor<00:02:40.640> up

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
floor we're measuring from the floor up

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.000 
floor we're measuring from the floor up
and<00:02:41.090> we<00:02:41.630> found<00:02:41.900> that<00:02:42.110> with<00:02:42.230> our<00:02:42.350> hinge<00:02:42.560> bracket

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
and we found that with our hinge bracket

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.190 
and we found that with our hinge bracket
the<00:02:43.430> lower<00:02:43.640> point<00:02:44.030> is<00:02:44.240> almost<00:02:44.420> always<00:02:44.780> square

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
the lower point is almost always square

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.650 
the lower point is almost always square
the<00:02:46.070> upper<00:02:46.280> point<00:02:46.490> is<00:02:46.670> almost<00:02:46.970> always<00:02:47.270> round

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
the upper point is almost always round

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:53.130 
the upper point is almost always round
so<00:02:48.530> with<00:02:48.770> that<00:02:50.650> you<00:02:51.650> would<00:02:51.770> get<00:02:51.920> a<00:02:51.950> round<00:02:52.130> clamp

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
so with that you would get a round clamp

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.250 
so with that you would get a round clamp
and<00:02:54.140> it<00:02:54.230> works<00:02:54.440> just<00:02:55.190> like<00:02:55.340> the<00:02:55.610> square<00:02:55.790> clamp

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
and it works just like the square clamp

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.980 
and it works just like the square clamp
and<00:02:57.260> it<00:02:57.380> mounts<00:02:57.620> around<00:02:57.860> the<00:02:58.640> round<00:02:58.880> point<00:02:59.240> of

00:02:59.980 --> 00:02:59.990 
and it mounts around the round point of

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:07.030 
and it mounts around the round point of
the<00:03:00.200> gate<00:03:00.820> excuse<00:03:01.820> me<00:03:01.970> a<00:03:02.000> banister<00:03:06.040> tighten

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
the gate excuse me a banister tighten

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.380 
the gate excuse me a banister tighten
that<00:03:07.130> down<00:03:07.190> you<00:03:07.460> see<00:03:07.700> these<00:03:07.850> are<00:03:08.000> wood<00:03:08.210> they're

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
that down you see these are wood they're

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.870 
that down you see these are wood they're
made<00:03:08.510> of<00:03:08.630> poplar<00:03:08.840> you<00:03:09.710> can<00:03:09.860> paint<00:03:10.100> them<00:03:10.220> you

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
made of poplar you can paint them you

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.140 
made of poplar you can paint them you
can<00:03:11.030> stain<00:03:11.300> them<00:03:11.480> to<00:03:11.570> match<00:03:11.750> posts<00:03:13.030> then<00:03:14.030> with

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
can stain them to match posts then with

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.490 
can stain them to match posts then with
a<00:03:14.210> little<00:03:14.270> polyurethane<00:03:14.960> and<00:03:15.140> they<00:03:15.200> just<00:03:15.320> kind

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
a little polyurethane and they just kind

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.790 
a little polyurethane and they just kind
of<00:03:15.560> disappear<00:03:15.620> if<00:03:16.550> you're<00:03:16.670> worried<00:03:16.910> about<00:03:17.000> any

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
of disappear if you're worried about any

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.820 
of disappear if you're worried about any
marring<00:03:18.800> if<00:03:19.340> you<00:03:19.490> want<00:03:19.640> to<00:03:19.730> use<00:03:19.850> maybe<00:03:20.090> some

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
marring if you want to use maybe some

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.580 
marring if you want to use maybe some
foam<00:03:21.830> tape<00:03:22.130> and<00:03:22.400> put<00:03:22.520> it<00:03:22.610> on<00:03:22.670> the<00:03:22.760> inside<00:03:23.590> you'd

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
foam tape and put it on the inside you'd

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.860 
foam tape and put it on the inside you'd
recommend<00:03:24.890> that<00:03:25.160> too<00:03:25.430> so<00:03:26.390> again<00:03:26.570> that's<00:03:26.720> just

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
recommend that too so again that's just

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.390 
recommend that too so again that's just
hand<00:03:27.200> tighten<00:03:27.440> but<00:03:27.590> you<00:03:27.740> can<00:03:27.860> see<00:03:28.040> that<00:03:28.190> that

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
hand tighten but you can see that that

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.250 
hand tighten but you can see that that
is<00:03:28.910> about<00:03:29.240> the<00:03:29.420> 28<00:03:30.040> inches<00:03:31.040> off<00:03:31.220> the<00:03:31.250> ground

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
is about the 28 inches off the ground

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:41.830 
is about the 28 inches off the ground
and<00:03:33.260> then<00:03:33.410> from<00:03:33.620> there<00:03:33.830> you<00:03:34.010> can<00:03:34.160> see<00:03:40.690> so<00:03:41.690> where

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
and then from there you can see so where

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.230 
and then from there you can see so where
these<00:03:41.960> two<00:03:42.170> holes<00:03:42.410> are<00:03:42.880> you<00:03:43.880> would<00:03:44.000> screw

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:44.240 
these two holes are you would screw

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.880 
these two holes are you would screw
directly<00:03:44.360> into<00:03:44.870> the<00:03:44.960> clamps<00:03:45.320> and<00:03:45.530> then<00:03:45.770> you

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
directly into the clamps and then you

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.140 
directly into the clamps and then you
don't<00:03:46.070> damage<00:03:46.310> your<00:03:46.670> post<00:03:48.850> so<00:03:49.850> that's<00:03:50.030> the

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
don't damage your post so that's the

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.610 
don't damage your post so that's the
hinge<00:03:50.360> side<00:03:50.540> and<00:03:50.750> that's<00:03:50.870> how<00:03:51.020> that's<00:03:51.170> mounted

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:51.620 
hinge side and that's how that's mounted

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.720 
hinge side and that's how that's mounted
the<00:03:52.490> latch<00:03:52.670> side<00:03:52.910> is<00:03:53.180> very<00:03:53.450> similar<00:03:54.400> we<00:03:55.400> found

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
the latch side is very similar we found

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.560 
the latch side is very similar we found
that<00:03:55.960> most<00:03:56.960> people<00:03:57.640> if<00:03:58.640> with<00:03:59.090> a<00:03:59.120> post<00:03:59.390> like

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
that most people if with a post like

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.750 
that most people if with a post like
this<00:03:59.810> if<00:04:00.080> they're<00:04:00.200> mounting<00:04:00.530> say<00:04:01.250> hinge<00:04:01.550> to

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
this if they're mounting say hinge to

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.210 
this if they're mounting say hinge to
one<00:04:01.940> side<00:04:02.150> and<00:04:02.480> latch<00:04:02.750> the<00:04:03.050> other<00:04:03.290> you<00:04:04.040> don't

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
one side and latch the other you don't

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.420 
one side and latch the other you don't
need<00:04:04.400> the<00:04:04.490> square<00:04:04.760> clamp<00:04:05.060> at<00:04:05.240> all<00:04:06.310> what<00:04:07.310> you

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
need the square clamp at all what you

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.480 
need the square clamp at all what you
will<00:04:07.550> need<00:04:07.700> are<00:04:08.510> two<00:04:08.690> round<00:04:08.960> clamps<00:04:09.490> because

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:10.490 
will need are two round clamps because

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:15.610 
will need are two round clamps because
this<00:04:11.080> also<00:04:12.080> amounts<00:04:12.620> to<00:04:13.580> screwed<00:04:14.090> points<00:04:14.620> the

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
this also amounts to screwed points the

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.099 
this also amounts to screwed points the
first<00:04:15.890> one<00:04:16.100> is<00:04:16.250> 17<00:04:16.940> inches<00:04:17.239> off<00:04:17.420> the<00:04:17.450> floor<00:04:17.810> and

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
first one is 17 inches off the floor and

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.800 
first one is 17 inches off the floor and
the<00:04:18.859> upper<00:04:19.100> one<00:04:19.280> is<00:04:19.790> also<00:04:20.239> 28<00:04:20.690> inches

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
the upper one is also 28 inches

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.360 
the upper one is also 28 inches
so<00:04:22.350> I'm<00:04:22.410> not<00:04:22.530> gonna<00:04:22.710> bother<00:04:22.830> putting<00:04:23.130> another

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
so I'm not gonna bother putting another

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:25.040 
so I'm not gonna bother putting another
round<00:04:23.820> clam<00:04:24.060> but<00:04:24.210> it<00:04:24.330> goes<00:04:24.450> about<00:04:24.660> right<00:04:24.870> here

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
round clam but it goes about right here

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.320 
round clam but it goes about right here
around<00:04:25.260> this<00:04:25.410> round<00:04:25.620> point<00:04:25.919> the<00:04:26.760> round<00:04:26.970> clamps

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
around this round point the round clamps

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.290 
around this round point the round clamps
also<00:04:27.660> come<00:04:27.870> with<00:04:27.900> shims<00:04:28.320> so<00:04:29.160> that<00:04:29.310> if<00:04:29.490> your

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 
also come with shims so that if your

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.310 
also come with shims so that if your
post<00:04:30.630> is<00:04:30.870> very<00:04:31.110> tapered<00:04:31.550> you<00:04:32.550> can<00:04:32.700> put<00:04:32.910> a<00:04:32.940> shim

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
post is very tapered you can put a shim

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.140 
post is very tapered you can put a shim
through<00:04:34.320> this<00:04:34.440> through<00:04:35.070> the<00:04:35.160> upper<00:04:35.430> and<00:04:35.880> you

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
through this through the upper and you

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.820 
through this through the upper and you
can<00:04:36.350> put<00:04:37.350> that<00:04:37.500> out<00:04:37.560> a<00:04:37.710> little<00:04:37.889> bit<00:04:38.130> so<00:04:39.830> that's

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
can put that out a little bit so that's

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.100 
can put that out a little bit so that's
pretty<00:04:41.760> much<00:04:41.850> all<00:04:42.150> there<00:04:42.360> is<00:04:42.510> to<00:04:42.750> it

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
pretty much all there is to it

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.600 
pretty much all there is to it
you<00:04:43.350> saw<00:04:43.530> how<00:04:43.680> the<00:04:43.740> hinge<00:04:43.950> side<00:04:44.130> is<00:04:44.280> mounted

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:44.610 
you saw how the hinge side is mounted

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.520 
you saw how the hinge side is mounted
latch<00:04:45.270> sides<00:04:45.570> mount<00:04:45.810> in<00:04:45.930> the<00:04:45.990> same<00:04:46.169> way<00:04:46.350> with

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
latch sides mount in the same way with

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.409 
latch sides mount in the same way with
two<00:04:46.650> round<00:04:46.860> clamps<00:04:47.280> so<00:04:47.370> just<00:04:47.580> think<00:04:48.150> about<00:04:48.210> it

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
two round clamps so just think about it

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:49.670 
two round clamps so just think about it
this<00:04:48.510> way<00:04:48.660> if<00:04:48.810> you've<00:04:48.900> got<00:04:49.080> a<00:04:49.110> post<00:04:49.380> that<00:04:49.530> looks

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
this way if you've got a post that looks

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.950 
this way if you've got a post that looks
like<00:04:49.830> this<00:04:50.300> the<00:04:51.300> hinge<00:04:51.510> side<00:04:51.720> is<00:04:51.870> gonna

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
like this the hinge side is gonna

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.710 
like this the hinge side is gonna
require<00:04:52.320> one<00:04:52.680> square<00:04:53.040> in<00:04:53.190> one<00:04:53.370> round<00:04:53.580> the<00:04:54.510> left

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
require one square in one round the left

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.290 
require one square in one round the left
side<00:04:54.960> will<00:04:55.200> require<00:04:55.590> two<00:04:55.889> rounds<00:04:56.310> and<00:04:57.150> if

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
side will require two rounds and if

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.100 
side will require two rounds and if
there<00:04:57.450> any<00:04:57.479> other<00:04:57.630> questions<00:04:59.300> or<00:05:00.300> needs
