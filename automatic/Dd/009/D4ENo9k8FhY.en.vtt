typical<00:01:59.160> benchmade<00:01:59.610> clip<00:01:59.880> i<00:02:01.520> think<00:02:02.520> they've

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
typical benchmade clip i think they've

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.950 
typical benchmade clip i think they've
gotten<00:02:02.880> a<00:02:03.000> little<00:02:03.150> bit<00:02:03.300> more<00:02:03.450> creative<00:02:03.750> with

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
gotten a little bit more creative with

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.410 
gotten a little bit more creative with
their<00:02:04.110> clips<00:02:04.320> now<00:02:04.560> but<00:02:04.830> for<00:02:05.400> quite<00:02:05.670> a<00:02:06.150> quite<00:02:06.390> a

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
their clips now but for quite a quite a

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.850 
their clips now but for quite a quite a
few<00:02:06.480> years<00:02:06.630> this<00:02:07.050> is<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.290> only<00:02:07.410> clip<00:02:07.710> they

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
few years this is the only clip they

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.840 
few years this is the only clip they
used<00:02:09.560> and<00:02:10.560> this<00:02:10.710> knife<00:02:10.950> was<00:02:11.160> released<00:02:11.550> I<00:02:11.820> think

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
used and this knife was released I think

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.500 
used and this knife was released I think
in<00:02:12.890> around<00:02:13.890> 2000<00:02:14.700> or<00:02:14.790> something<00:02:14.940> like<00:02:15.240> that

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
in around 2000 or something like that

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:21.380 
in around 2000 or something like that
