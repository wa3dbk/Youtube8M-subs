 which allows me to perform my small 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:29.099
 operations, in particular concerning 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:31.529

 warm a little bit the feet of my 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.540
 sowing in early March this year I 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.809
 did it on March 6th it was a good 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:48.020
 date to sow plants such as 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.460
 tomatoes 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.219

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.329
 which contain melons they have been 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:58.550
 disabled and very quickly to wander in 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:04.470
 each of the bins 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:06.390
 I sow very shallow in here is one of 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.119
 bach who has not yet undergone the 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:13.380
 picking out what you 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:16.680
 gives an idea of ​​how many seeds have 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.540
 knowing that most of the seeds of 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:24.360
 verne tomatoes it's pretty sturdy like 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:25.930
 to do I have several departments and at 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.300
 background 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.000
 I have the transplants that I already have 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.470
 carried out and I will try in the 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.040
 even filming to show you how 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.390
 transplanting the tomatoes 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.110
 what ingredients do I have 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.820
 need to have a radio for the 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.090
 music is good right now they are talking 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.510
 so I'm going to turn off because it's okay 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.890
 bother 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:56.470
 here I have a collection of small pots 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:58.869
 I have a peaty soil here 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.200
 in my opinion but essec very fine a 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:05.950
 seedling and cuttings 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:10.530
 I have here in the fake a potting soil more 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:14.170
 normal that I refined by hand in the 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:18.070
 rubbing trt but tomorrow where the crust 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:23.440
 but better and I have the little ones 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:26.940
 pots that will receive my little feet 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.320
 tomatoes in a few moments 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:33.610
 so I'll start by putting in 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:36.820
 bottom of each of these little jars a little 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:41.070
 of this soil there and at the same time 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:46.510
 will serve as drains I just have it at the bottom 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:52.500
 limit myself to three Protestants I 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.500
 complete with the other hero 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:03.050
 I do a little bit this approximate 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:05.330
 and I'm going to make a pretty toothache 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:10.910
 big because we'll see that I'm keeping 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:13.390
 my art a little bit of earth when I 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:23.420
 do my transplanting 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:25.670
 I wet a little deep here I have a 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:30.890
 little spoon and with this little 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:33.800
 spoon I'll go to this one who 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.900
 contains three varieties of tomatoes the 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:39.080
 brandished on top of the Caspian and 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.130
 pink and the 1884 on which I already 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.530
 took the samples 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:45.650
 so I will start with the Caspian 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:49.730
 pink I'm going to take a little plan 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.920
 easy for shooting I pass the 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.300
 small with one hand the little 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.540
 spoon underneath I hope it's okay 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.400
 go 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:04:00.680
 here and I lift the small seedlings 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.920
 of voice if I apologize loud despite your 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:08.300
 mag we should I have only one hand I 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:12.170

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:16.489
 the little hole there I have you a little bit 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:21.620
 on the games side the right on 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:23.870
 the address I complete around with my 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.850
 seedlings potting soil that I did 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:29.360
 not paid very expensive a quality hope 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:32.420
 good enough anyway that there is 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:34.760
 end that's what I want here are his 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:37.010
 rights I come up a little litter 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:40.820
 earthen 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:43.240
 I spend a little course are enough you 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:48.170
 have seen that I do not have enough strength 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:50.800
 juicy contract and I end up allowing 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:55.440
 a small dose everything with a chouïa 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:59.320
 of liquid fertilizer that I put there 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:03.040
 that's what it gives I'm going to do that 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:08.380
 I know 6 by six in general I'm going 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:13.990
 noted on my chart that for the 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:16.330
 pink caspian I redid the potting 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.200
 today I have ours they succeed 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.530
 would be the temperature readings 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:24.310
 which occurred the date of sowing of 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:27.880
 each variety and I will put the 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:32.080
 tower in polystyrene boxes 

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:33.340
 what type of there are boxes in 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.280
 which there was ground beef 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.890
 when I go to intermarché that I keep 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.240
 preciously 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:42.880
 so here are the transplants that have 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:47.530
 been made for example this variety 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:48.910
 magee was transplanted when they 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:56.850
 had small leaves he was 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:06:02.980
 made the day before yesterday the 26th 3 and she already has 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:04.690
 well taken none of the seedlings that I have 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:06.669
 small plans that I transplanted did 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:07.210
 dropped from the head so that's they are 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:10.450
 very happy 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:13.530
 here is what I did yesterday to saint 

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:20.770
 lucie eon here I did this morning 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:26.880
 like the black hand and 6 3 the 29 3 you 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:29.230
 see roughly the flaws and the height 

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.730
 of the small plan it is important not that it 

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:32.500
 be very very high way just two 

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:34.510
 little leaves one two that are there 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:36.400
 this one had hardly a first time 

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:39.160
 he appeared but he was positioned 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:41.260
 so that I was going there goes he goes 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:43.480
 totally recover he wants to catch up 

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:46.030
 did the others very quickly so it was 

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:46.720
 this one the most advanced is this one the 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:49.840
 less advanced 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:51.550
 same thing for a horned horny who does not 

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:53.890
 not take the blackest the retort run it 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:56.590
 is an old French variety 

00:06:53.890 --> 00:07:01.169
 the rose gives there it's works 

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:03.880
 this morning so here is a general view 

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:05.930
 from the air 

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:08.680
 in which I do my little ones 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.680
 manipulations 

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:16.880
 we are lucky to have here a 

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:18.680
 other excellent that comes from the 

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:21.740
 mountain that can be seen above 

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:24.110
 the house that the black mountain and I 

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:25.760
 harvest here some rainwater 

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:28.010
 also it was a more water had aimed 

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:32.810
 a water that is excellent excellent at 

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:35.660
 drink by the way I hope all 

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:39.760
 will be fine now after these little 

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:39.760
 freshness of march
