00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.830
 HB Cairo now where I mean of course there is here 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.649
 this is a super club 

00:00:08.649 --> 00:00:10.889
 and 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.889
 in the plane to borrow the slope beech 

00:00:15.069 --> 00:00:17.730
 and I had that up a bit 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.320
 and I think 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.599
 These little changes make the sun here so a bit 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:26.050
 first the word 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.060
 added up 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.060
 Do you think so van Cleef this 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.940
 then the tip goes to the very bottom 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.970
 and then it looks like that 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.550
 now I hold so high 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.550
 up 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.850
 and these three 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.750
 So still off 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:01.930
 Tip down 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.460
 And if you drive up quickly where everyone knew the 3 then what does that look like 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.490
 like this 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.190
 sticking point 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:13.930
 we take from the right side 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.000
 the triangle assets customer is located 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000
 Warns the suffering is not clicked 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.180
 Accident injured carefully 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.590
 here in this corner 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.110
 declined 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.110
 first a bit wild 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.160
 beautiful Vienna has lived so you can keep it all 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.100
 undisputedly that 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.700
 that's the hardest part of this spring 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.340
 Xing in the forum 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.440
 and to serve these prejudices 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.440
 and here underneath and announcements 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.970
 I put the gate 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.970
 even with the 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.350
 do you work everything 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.350
 Messemer one page already finished 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.579
 the other side just like that 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:12.579
 Heike in front of Ola 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.269
 QuakenbrÃ¼ck 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:23.359
 as are the pores 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:29.299
 So who moves out? 

00:02:32.779 --> 00:02:35.779
 here like the zoo with 

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:49.589
 it says it 

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:52.589
 October 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:08.549
 this is how he looks like 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:12.000
 What I'm doing now I'm doing a very long time and you have to do that sometimes 

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:14.999
 wanted to try sporty 

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:19.430
 Do you have these up so support this Zeil 

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:24.369
 on these lines 

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:28.939
 that's the way Kurth 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:37.839
 so again 

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:40.739
 the show was created here 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.689
 you can also be so close 

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:45.689
 push up 

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:48.689
 can you do that 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:57.709
 if I have the current red flap 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.709
 arise here so two handbags 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:09.819
 that's not what the plane sees in terms of stability 

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:13.759
 especially foods 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.859
 it folds your hands together 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.829
 Forum for the out 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:26.650
 the jetty should 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:29.150
 be folded horizontally 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.150
 and not too high 

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:41.599
 and add to it 

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:50.110
 Abuse of the fliers still on 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.110
 the economic indicators 

00:04:57.559 --> 00:04:59.150
 and we have one 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.150
 fantastic, of course, yourself 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:08.490
 I grew up settling for five Lukla on the curb elevator 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.550
 then you can vary that a bit and the four-legged friends too fast 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:12.580
 crash 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:15.580
 you can easily fold the back 

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:19.979
 But I have another idea that shows for me now how to 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:22.979
 Nevertheless it can still be swallowed 

00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:26.360
 I put the early bloomers together 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.360
 and Schneider honored 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.469
 Triangle off 

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:35.279
 just like that 

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:38.279
 cut off the tips a bit 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.370
 here's another cut on the world enough 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:45.930
 Schnetz three times 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.930
 and can as now 

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:53.439
 up here 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.900
 and you have a game 

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:08.629
 looks very strong too 

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:13.569
 and that's how he looks from Radware Tables 

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:15.479
 looks good for the good 

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:17.490
 Definitely fun
