00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 hi everybody is gay but if 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.259
 welcome to this new video that will be 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.160
 the review dedicated to a book I have 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.349
 read this month in the books category 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.849
 then then then this month I am 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.550
 dedicated to reading a book that 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.980
 I had bought in in the previous months 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.660
 I don't remember exactly when and which 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.699
 my partner recommended me 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.269
 of a kind that I'm not used to 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.310
 read that I don't like to read because 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:31.410
 mimÃ¬ same names put too much indeed to 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.480
 this kind of books and even signatures 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.030
 everything I see badly revolves around 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.160
 to the psychological thriller and all these things 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.690
 but here I wanted to finish this one 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.520
 my partner because she has good s 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.710
 tastes that often reflect mine 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.450
 so since he said that the 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.550
 she likes the writer and is also very determined 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.350
 of karmic you have already seen it in eleven 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.449
 you buy and you see it also in the title yes 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.170
 speaks of ten little Agatha Indians 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.840
 christie 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.510
 I bought the edition of the classics 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.270
 modern from 9 euros and very normal without 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.390
 nothing with as usual forewords 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.489
 biographies and so on and so forth 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:09.689
 and this book literally has me 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.700
 left open-mouthed I started it at 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.330
 morning and I finished it late 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.290
 afternoon 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:19.979
 and this can account for that too 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.450
 if I am 185 pages 176 it is not 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.460
 I am still so big I am 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.799
 smashed in an afternoon in a few words 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.390
 then it is perhaps useless to talk about the 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.040
 plot ten small Indians because it 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.890
 almost everyone knows, however, I want 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.409
 just talk about it with you then 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.570
 first we have ten people 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.640
 these ten people receive one 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.720
 mysterious letter from a man who does 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.619
 signature or by a woman who signs herself as u 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.770
 n 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:53.909
 owen who elected in English almost sounds 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.500
 as an announcement is unknown and come 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.030
 invited by this letter su 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.979
 an island an island that was bought 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.730
 from someone 's mysterious point of name 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.400
 of name orwell e 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:08.180
 once found on this island and with 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:10.040
 the two butlers and a man e 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:13.490
 woman husband and wife and these eight 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.290
 people all the different ranks of 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:16.490
 especially aspects of characters 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.220
 completely different one 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.860
 on the other hand all ten find each other 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.190
 this big house and this big house 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:28.280
 where the same evening they arrive a 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.050
 bit part and record makes them feel 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.180
 a record in which everyone is accused 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.330
 how many over- coleman committed at least 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.910
 murder accused testifies there was real 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.410
 to have let a child drown on 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.880
 doctor who was accused of killing 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.440
 the poor woman 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.690
 the judge accused of having 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.400
 convicted an innocent person without 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.800
 we all have these various characters that 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.510
 they are all accused of having committed 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.100
 just a murder 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.810
 initially they think it is 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.140
 just a bad joke 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.630
 when the same evening 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.520
 practically two of them die and one 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.130
 very particular thing that also gives the 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.480
 title to the book is a nursery rhyme that in 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.920
 but reality is not that of ten 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.500
 small Indians but is that of ten 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.200
 little black boys these little black boys 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.910
 that practically one by one they die 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.800
 until none remains 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.170
 and it looks like this killer that 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:22.670
 will begin to hunt all 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:25.760
 ten present on the island follow 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:29.570
 to this nursery rhyme because the first of 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.940
 they will die asphyxiated by food from 

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:34.880
 from the drink the second will die in 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:37.459
 sleep and so on, thus following 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.320
 just so sometimes even a little 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.300
 more than anything else, however, metaphorical 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.500
 following the rhyme of the ten 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.450
 little black boys 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.730
 so we will be catapulted up 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.130
 this island with these ten people that 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.810
 they can't trust any of them 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.489
 because everyone could be 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.080
 the murderer above all fact 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.910
 that after breaking the island yes 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.890
 realize that no one could 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.910
 hiding because it's practically flat 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.739
 like the palm of a hand 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.410
 there are no creeks there are not 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:05.000
 caves there are no holes trees ie 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.920
 there is nothing at all where they could 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.260
 to hide and even the house is so 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.609
 new than not being able to hide gods 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.260
 repair where a murderer could 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:15.989
 therefore hide themselves 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.760
 completely alone all ten in 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:19.799
 this island to suspect one 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.930
 of the other and obviously it will not come 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:23.850
 said the killer until the end of 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.050
 book that will also be enough 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.210
 upsetting 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:30.630
 to me the ending and I have to tell the truth is 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.400
 my apple partner was spoiled 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.199
 he told me in advance not what 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.430
 he handed me the book of course it is 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:38.280
 one of my companions told me in 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:40.460
 advance but I did what to remove 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.410
 what she told me she went to 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.940
 re-enter the book without it 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.370
 I felt nothing and I did 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:50.250
 very well because despite knowing already 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:53.550
 who had killed all those people 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:56.669
 all ten then die too 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.789
 the murderer himself eventually dies and the 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:02.250
 dynamics obviously I don't tell you is 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:05.070
 practically all of these despite 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:07.380
 all he knew is the way everything 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.880
 the explanation that has been given has happened 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.910
 in the final epilogue it was really 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.860
 something absolutely exceptional e 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.810
 a book that especially for the 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.889
 narrative technique really surprised me 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:22.080
 very much because it is a book 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:23.849
 extremely self in the third person but that 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.539
 sometimes it catapults you into the minds of the 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:27.169
 characters 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:29.849
 so we feel the thoughts 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:32.669
 restless the fear the fear the 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:36.120
 anger confusion tranquility a 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:37.380
 sometimes very strange of the characters and 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.110
 let's get right into their heads 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:42.539
 we end up being catapulted into the 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.520
 their mentality and everyone could have 

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:46.380
 a reason to kill everyone else 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.020
 they could all have motive 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.849
 they could be and it really is 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.710
 shocking to follow and the dynamics of 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:55.110
 events the way they follow each other for 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:56.940
 get to the final but it is definitely the 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.070
 best book I've read so far 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.740
 absolutely in the current year 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:03.750
 book that surprised me a lot 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:06.810
 I did not expect that you would love and 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:08.880
 those few think beyond me that still don't 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:10.289
 they read that they will never have it 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.550
 elected, however, for those few who still do 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:13.229
 they did not elect him on the council 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.000
 really read it even if it's not there 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:17.169
 to keep gender because to me it is 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.849
 really liked it a lot 

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:21.400
 the history and style of writing this 

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:22.960
 wanting to recall in such a sadistic way 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:25.330
 to the nursery rhyme of the ten little ones 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.960
 negretti really enjoyed it 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.240
 casino 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.849
 and then that is really shocking 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.409
 final is something absolutely 

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:34.169
 fantastic so I recommend ten 

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:36.520
 little indians of agatha christie 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:38.620
 I hope you will follow my advice 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.999
 because it's really worth it for one 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:42.370
 time it's really worth it 

00:06:39.999 --> 00:06:44.409
 listen to me also because it is found 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:46.029
 see constitution 10 euros 

00:06:44.409 --> 00:06:47.650
 then the big book not so big 

00:06:46.029 --> 00:06:49.749
 so you can read it all and it is 

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:51.939
 really addictive then 

00:06:49.749 --> 00:06:54.819
 listen to me it's not bought who already has it 

00:06:51.939 --> 00:06:56.710
 let's talk about it below and I hope the 

00:06:54.819 --> 00:07:00.479
 review liked it see you at 

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:00.479
 next video hi all guys
