and they have this little por inside the

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.940 
and they have this little por inside the
controller<00:01:00.700> that<00:01:01.120> flips<00:01:01.510> open<00:01:01.660> right<00:01:02.440> here

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:02.950 
controller that flips open right here

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:09.750 
controller that flips open right here
and<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:04.300> car<00:01:04.570> fits<00:01:04.930> right<00:01:05.380> into<00:01:05.650> it<00:01:08.760> there's

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
and the car fits right into it there's

and the car fits right into it there's
also<00:01:10.150> a<00:01:10.330> charging<00:01:11.280> port<00:01:12.280> that<00:01:12.520> isn't<00:01:13.090> like<00:01:13.240> the

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
also a charging port that isn't like the

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.350 
also a charging port that isn't like the
bottom<00:01:13.750> of<00:01:13.900> it<00:01:14.020> right<00:01:14.230> here<00:01:15.120> pull<00:01:16.120> that<00:01:16.300> out

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
bottom of it right here pull that out

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:22.000 
bottom of it right here pull that out
and<00:01:17.640> plug<00:01:18.640> it

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010

but and there are sweet three switches
in<00:01:26.330> the<00:01:26.420> controller<00:01:26.780> there's<00:01:27.500> a<00:01:27.590> zero<00:01:28.220> a

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
in the controller there's a zero a

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:36.070 
in the controller there's a zero a
lightning<00:01:30.410> strike<00:01:32.020> somewhere<00:01:34.480> yeah<00:01:35.480> there's

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
lightning strike somewhere yeah there's

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.710 
lightning strike somewhere yeah there's
a<00:01:36.140> zero<00:01:36.470> and<00:01:36.860> you<00:01:36.920> see<00:01:37.100> in<00:01:37.160> the<00:01:37.220> middle

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
a zero and you see in the middle

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.630 
a zero and you see in the middle
lightning<00:01:38.720> strike<00:01:38.990> to<00:01:39.380> charge<00:01:39.710> and<00:01:40.070> then

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
lightning strike to charge and then

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.810 
lightning strike to charge and then
there's<00:01:40.850> like<00:01:41.000> a<00:01:41.090> one<00:01:41.360> on<00:01:41.660> top<00:01:42.050> of<00:01:42.230> it<00:01:42.320> and

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
there's like a one on top of it and

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.400 
there's like a one on top of it and
that's<00:01:43.820> for<00:01:44.570> turning<00:01:45.200> it<00:01:45.290> on<00:01:45.380> and<00:01:47.110> just<00:01:48.110> when

that's for turning it on and just when
you're<00:01:48.530> done<00:01:48.650> charging<00:01:48.890> just<00:01:49.280> unplug<00:01:50.030> the

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
you're done charging just unplug the

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.030 
you're done charging just unplug the
cable<00:01:50.690> and<00:01:50.870> the<00:01:50.900> charging<00:01:51.350> times<00:01:51.530> about<00:01:51.770> 20

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
right here in here if you've seen the

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.610 
right here in here if you've seen the
stealth<00:02:31.940> rides<00:02:32.210> the<00:02:32.420> controllers<00:02:32.960> are<00:02:33.200> like

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
stealth rides the controllers are like

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.280 
stealth rides the controllers are like
this<00:02:34.190> it's<00:02:34.640> like<00:02:34.760> a<00:02:34.790> tank<00:02:35.060> control<00:02:35.510> for<00:02:36.200> either

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
this it's like a tank control for either

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.220 
this it's like a tank control for either
the<00:02:36.470> car<00:02:36.800> or<00:02:37.040> the<00:02:37.070> tank<00:02:37.550> but<00:02:38.450> this<00:02:38.600> one<00:02:38.810> is<00:02:39.110> like

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
the car or the tank but this one is like

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.390 
the car or the tank but this one is like
a<00:02:39.290> regular<00:02:39.620> like<00:02:40.100> new<00:02:40.280> brake<00:02:40.550> controller<00:02:41.060> up

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
a regular like new brake controller up

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.350 
a regular like new brake controller up
forward<00:02:43.400> reverse<00:02:43.720> the<00:02:44.720> right<00:02:45.320> and<00:02:45.620> it<00:02:46.550> has<00:02:46.790> you

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
forward reverse the right and it has you

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.840 
forward reverse the right and it has you
can<00:02:47.510> have<00:02:47.660> it<00:02:47.960> has<00:02:48.200> multiple<00:02:48.560> speeds<00:02:49.070> so<00:02:49.790> you

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
can have it has multiple speeds so you

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.320 
can have it has multiple speeds so you
can<00:02:50.300> go<00:02:50.480> slow<00:02:50.840> and<00:02:51.170> fast<00:02:51.650> and<00:02:52.000> then<00:02:53.000> there<00:02:53.300> are

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
can go slow and fast and then there are

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.060 
can go slow and fast and then there are
two<00:02:53.450> buttons<00:02:53.630> right<00:02:53.930> here<00:02:53.990> right<00:02:54.680> above<00:02:54.770> the

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
two buttons right here right above the

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.100 
two buttons right here right above the
steering<00:02:55.490> which<00:02:55.670> is<00:02:55.820> the<00:02:55.940> steering<00:02:56.330> trip<00:02:56.570> to

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
steering which is the steering trip to

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.470

there's two separate motors for each of
the<00:03:16.850> back<00:03:17.000> wheels<00:03:17.270> and<00:03:17.600> then<00:03:18.170> if<00:03:18.440> it<00:03:18.650> turns

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890
