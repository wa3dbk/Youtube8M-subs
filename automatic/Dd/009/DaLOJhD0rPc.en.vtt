prerequisite to being a great player

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.260 
prerequisite to being a great player
there<00:00:16.560> are<00:00:16.619> plenty<00:00:17.100> of<00:00:17.130> great<00:00:17.550> players<00:00:17.880> that

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
there are plenty of great players that

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.090 
there are plenty of great players that
don't<00:00:18.779> know<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.080> names<00:00:19.260> of<00:00:19.529> all<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:19.830> notes

don't know the names of all the notes

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.250 
don't know the names of all the notes
they're<00:00:20.310> playing<00:00:20.550> probably<00:00:20.990> more<00:00:21.990> players

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
they're playing probably more players

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.000 
they're playing probably more players
that<00:00:22.529> don't<00:00:22.710> then<00:00:23.490> players<00:00:23.880> that<00:00:24.150> do<00:00:24.359> so<00:00:25.109> it's

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
that don't then players that do so it's

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.620 
that don't then players that do so it's
definitely<00:00:26.369> not<00:00:26.490> a<00:00:26.550> prerequisite<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.210> being<00:00:27.510> a

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
definitely not a prerequisite to being a

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.330 
definitely not a prerequisite to being a
good<00:00:27.750> player<00:00:27.900> but<00:00:28.680> it's<00:00:28.830> not<00:00:28.980> going<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.189> hold

playing well so here's six ideas six
ways<00:00:36.149> you<00:00:36.329> can<00:00:36.480> practice<00:00:37.040> memorizing<00:00:38.040> note

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
ways you can practice memorizing note

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.610 
ways you can practice memorizing note
names<00:00:38.460> one<00:00:39.120> of<00:00:39.149> them<00:00:39.420> is<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.719> just<00:00:39.750> go<00:00:40.140> string

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
names one of them is to just go string

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.650 
names one of them is to just go string
by<00:00:40.770> string<00:00:40.969> and<00:00:41.969> this<00:00:42.149> is<00:00:42.300> fairly

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
by string and this is fairly

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.690 
by string and this is fairly
conventional<00:00:43.020> way<00:00:43.500> for<00:00:43.920> for<00:00:44.250> people<00:00:44.460> to<00:00:44.550> work

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
conventional way for for people to work

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.119 
conventional way for for people to work
on<00:00:44.820> stuff<00:00:45.149> I<00:00:45.390> memorize<00:00:46.050> no<00:00:46.289> names<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.770> that<00:00:46.890> is

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
on stuff I memorize no names and that is

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.740 
on stuff I memorize no names and that is
take<00:00:47.940> say<00:00:48.600> a<00:00:48.629> scale<00:00:49.500> like<00:00:49.800> C<00:00:50.010> major<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.750> one

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
take say a scale like C major and one

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.840 
take say a scale like C major and one
string<00:00:52.199> only<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.949> just<00:00:53.129> work<00:00:53.309> on<00:00:53.460> memorizing

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
string only and just work on memorizing

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.869 
string only and just work on memorizing
notes<00:00:54.390> from<00:00:55.140> that<00:00:55.199> one<00:00:55.649> string<00:00:55.980> only<00:00:56.340> so<00:00:56.579> like

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
notes from that one string only so like

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.959 
notes from that one string only so like
lo<00:00:57.090> lo<00:00:57.690> ye<00:00:57.870> sixth<00:00:58.230> string<00:00:58.440> e<00:01:01.430> ABCDE

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
lo lo ye sixth string e ABCDE

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.910 
lo lo ye sixth string e ABCDE
and<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.660> can<00:01:03.870> kind<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.350> play<00:01:04.470> up<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.830> down

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
and you can kind of play up and down

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.310 
and you can kind of play up and down
that<00:01:05.400> way<00:01:05.720> just<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.840> kind<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.080> get<00:01:07.229> yourself

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
that way just to kind of get yourself

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.149 
that way just to kind of get yourself
familiar<00:01:07.740> with<00:01:08.390> when<00:01:09.390> I<00:01:09.420> hit<00:01:10.049> third<00:01:10.680> fret<00:01:10.950> here

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
familiar with when I hit third fret here

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.000 
familiar with when I hit third fret here
I'm<00:01:11.310> staying<00:01:11.610> G<00:01:12.299> out<00:01:12.659> loud<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.290> then<00:01:13.740> move<00:01:13.860> on

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
I'm staying G out loud and then move on

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.100 
I'm staying G out loud and then move on
to<00:01:14.130> another<00:01:14.460> string<00:01:17.479> and<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.659> can<00:01:18.810> move<00:01:18.960> on

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
to another string and you can move on

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.929 
to another string and you can move on
through<00:01:19.350> all<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.530> strings<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.159> all<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.729> keys

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
through all the strings and all the keys

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.469 
through all the strings and all the keys
that<00:01:20.970> way<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:22.320> also<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:23.100> do<00:01:23.939> this<00:01:24.210> in<00:01:24.360> another

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
that way it also I do this in another

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.960 
that way it also I do this in another
video<00:01:24.780> too<00:01:25.229> but<00:01:25.500> playing<00:01:25.860> a<00:01:26.280> simple<00:01:26.820> little

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
video too but playing a simple little

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.789 
video too but playing a simple little
melody<00:01:27.360> or<00:01:27.479> playing<00:01:27.659> melodically<00:01:28.229> at<00:01:28.590> least

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
melody or playing melodically at least

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.550 
melody or playing melodically at least
in<00:01:29.790> one<00:01:30.060> key<00:01:30.299> so<00:01:30.540> if<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.750> was<00:01:30.900> going<00:01:31.020> to<00:01:31.079> do<00:01:31.290> key

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
in one key so if I was going to do key

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.250 
in one key so if I was going to do key
of<00:01:31.710> C<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.280> just<00:01:33.150> on<00:01:33.390> one<00:01:33.600> string

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:34.260 
of C and just on one string

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.560 
of C and just on one string

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.740 
[Music]
yeah<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:39.640> just<00:01:39.820> kind<00:01:39.970> of<00:01:40.000> name<00:01:40.180> notes<00:01:40.450> as<00:01:40.630> you

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
yeah and just kind of name notes as you

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.630 
yeah and just kind of name notes as you
play<00:01:40.990> you<00:01:41.380> can<00:01:41.500> jump<00:01:41.680> around<00:01:41.800> that<00:01:42.220> way<00:01:42.400> and

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
play you can jump around that way and

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.310 
play you can jump around that way and
that's<00:01:43.000> a<00:01:43.150> little<00:01:43.270> more<00:01:43.420> fun<00:01:43.720> than<00:01:43.930> just<00:01:44.050> going

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:44.320 
that's a little more fun than just going

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.320 
that's a little more fun than just going
up<00:01:44.440> and<00:01:44.590> down<00:01:44.710> like<00:01:45.070> a<00:01:45.130> scale<00:01:45.520> or<00:01:45.550> just<00:01:45.880> trying

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
up and down like a scale or just trying

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.450 
up and down like a scale or just trying
to<00:01:46.420> force<00:01:47.020> yourself<00:01:47.380> to<00:01:47.410> memorize<00:01:47.860> something

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.460 
to force yourself to memorize something

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.160 
to force yourself to memorize something
just<00:01:48.790> name<00:01:49.060> it<00:01:49.090> while<00:01:49.390> you<00:01:49.570> play<00:01:49.810> it<00:01:49.990> and

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
just name it while you play it and

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.660 
just name it while you play it and
eventually<00:01:50.380> you<00:01:50.740> will<00:01:51.010> memorize<00:01:51.190> it

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
eventually you will memorize it

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.460 
eventually you will memorize it
another<00:01:52.240> thing<00:01:52.570> is<00:01:52.750> rather<00:01:52.960> than<00:01:53.170> going<00:01:53.320> up

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
another thing is rather than going up

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.020 
another thing is rather than going up
and<00:01:53.650> down<00:01:53.770> on<00:01:53.920> one<00:01:54.100> string<00:01:54.400> you<00:01:54.550> stay<00:01:54.820> in

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
and down on one string you stay in

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.110 
and down on one string you stay in
position<00:01:55.320> but<00:01:56.320> move<00:01:56.530> across<00:01:56.770> all<00:01:57.100> strings<00:01:57.430> so

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:58.120 
position but move across all strings so

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.870 
position but move across all strings so
again<00:01:58.540> with<00:01:58.780> key<00:01:59.050> of<00:01:59.140> C<00:01:59.640> starting<00:02:00.640> on<00:02:00.760> the

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
again with key of C starting on the

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:09.540 
again with key of C starting on the
lowest<00:02:01.210> note<00:02:01.420> we<00:02:01.540> can<00:02:01.690> hear<00:02:01.960> an<00:02:02.110> E<00:02:02.410> and<00:02:08.550> that

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
lowest note we can hear an E and that

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.130 
lowest note we can hear an E and that
kind<00:02:09.759> of<00:02:09.790> takes<00:02:09.940> care<00:02:10.119> of<00:02:10.300> all<00:02:10.509> one<00:02:10.780> position

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
kind of takes care of all one position

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.699 
kind of takes care of all one position
so<00:02:12.010> you<00:02:12.070> can<00:02:12.430> memorize<00:02:12.610> stuff<00:02:13.090> that<00:02:13.450> way<00:02:13.660> again

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
so you can memorize stuff that way again

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.620 
so you can memorize stuff that way again
you<00:02:14.830> don't<00:02:14.980> necessarily<00:02:15.130> have<00:02:15.580> to<00:02:15.760> try<00:02:16.180> and<00:02:16.240> do

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
you don't necessarily have to try and do

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.830 
you don't necessarily have to try and do
all<00:02:17.230> six<00:02:17.650> strings<00:02:17.860> all<00:02:18.160> at<00:02:18.280> once<00:02:18.490> but<00:02:19.150> just<00:02:19.660> as

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
all six strings all at once but just as

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.110 
all six strings all at once but just as
you<00:02:20.020> play<00:02:20.260> through<00:02:20.290> stuff<00:02:20.890> you<00:02:21.700> know<00:02:21.790> say<00:02:21.970> the

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
you play through stuff you know say the

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.580 
you play through stuff you know say the
name<00:02:22.300> of<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.510> note<00:02:22.660> while<00:02:22.870> you're<00:02:23.020> playing<00:02:23.230> it

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
name of the note while you're playing it

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.699 
name of the note while you're playing it
and<00:02:23.830> that<00:02:24.820> kind<00:02:24.910> of<00:02:25.000> reinforces<00:02:25.720> what<00:02:26.470> that

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
and that kind of reinforces what that

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.860 
and that kind of reinforces what that
note<00:02:26.950> is<00:02:27.130> what<00:02:27.520> what<00:02:27.790> are<00:02:27.940> you<00:02:27.970> playing<00:02:28.360> when

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
note is what what are you playing when

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.080 
note is what what are you playing when
your<00:02:28.989> finger<00:02:29.200> goes<00:02:29.380> here<00:02:29.890> and<00:02:30.040> you<00:02:30.760> can<00:02:30.910> name

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
your finger goes here and you can name

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.120 
your finger goes here and you can name
it<00:02:31.410> another<00:02:32.410> one<00:02:33.060> that<00:02:34.110> that's<00:02:35.110> kind<00:02:35.470> of<00:02:35.530> fun<00:02:35.800> I

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
it another one that that's kind of fun I

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.010 
it another one that that's kind of fun I
think<00:02:36.790> I<00:02:36.910> got<00:02:37.090> this<00:02:37.209> one<00:02:37.420> from<00:02:37.570> Joe<00:02:37.780> Satriani

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:38.020 
think I got this one from Joe Satriani

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.220 
think I got this one from Joe Satriani
and<00:02:38.560> that<00:02:38.680> is<00:02:38.860> set<00:02:39.730> like<00:02:40.000> a<00:02:40.030> metronome<00:02:40.420> or<00:02:40.930> or

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
and that is set like a metronome or or

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
and that is set like a metronome or or
just<00:02:41.910> you<00:02:42.910> know<00:02:43.000> pick<00:02:43.180> a<00:02:43.239> note<00:02:43.510> and<00:02:43.810> and<00:02:44.739> play

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
just you know pick a note and and play

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.790 
just you know pick a note and and play
through<00:02:45.690> maybe<00:02:46.690> between<00:02:46.989> the<00:02:47.230> frets<00:02:47.440> to<00:02:47.590> zero

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
through maybe between the frets to zero

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.490 
through maybe between the frets to zero
and<00:02:47.950> 12<00:02:48.280> all<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.209> places<00:02:50.080> on<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:50.320> fret<00:02:50.470> board

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
and 12 all the places on the fret board

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.949 
and 12 all the places on the fret board
where<00:02:50.830> you<00:02:50.860> can<00:02:51.250> play<00:02:51.459> that<00:02:51.730> one<00:02:51.940> so<00:02:52.450> if<00:02:52.720> we

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
where you can play that one so if we

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.580 
where you can play that one so if we
stay<00:02:53.530> with<00:02:53.680> E<00:02:53.950> for<00:02:54.340> a<00:02:54.370> second

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
stay with E for a second

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.470 
stay with E for a second
maybe<00:02:56.590> I'll<00:02:56.709> go<00:02:56.830> from<00:02:57.070> frets<00:02:57.340> 0<00:02:57.730> to<00:02:57.880> 12<00:02:58.120> and

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
maybe I'll go from frets 0 to 12 and

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.470 
maybe I'll go from frets 0 to 12 and
back<00:02:58.870> so<00:02:59.709> playing<00:03:00.670> from<00:03:00.850> lowest<00:03:01.150> fret<00:03:01.360> to

not only learn a little bit of the
background<00:06:09.150> theory<00:06:09.990> behind<00:06:10.170> what<00:06:11.040> notes<00:06:11.280> are

background theory behind what notes are
in<00:06:11.580> what<00:06:11.850> chord<00:06:12.180> but<00:06:12.810> you<00:06:12.960> also<00:06:13.280> if<00:06:14.280> you<00:06:14.580> do<00:06:14.790> all

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.060 
in what chord but you also if you do all

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.880 
in what chord but you also if you do all
six<00:06:15.330> of<00:06:15.450> these<00:06:15.540> things<00:06:15.930> just<00:06:16.200> a<00:06:16.380> little<00:06:16.410> bit

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:16.890 
six of these things just a little bit

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:19.610 
six of these things just a little bit
here<00:06:17.250> and<00:06:17.400> there<00:06:17.490> you'll<00:06:18.270> be<00:06:18.510> exposed<00:06:19.170> to<00:06:19.500> it

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:19.620 
here and there you'll be exposed to it

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.890 
here and there you'll be exposed to it
enough<00:06:19.920> that<00:06:20.310> you'll<00:06:21.030> start<00:06:21.330> to<00:06:21.450> remember

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:21.900 
enough that you'll start to remember

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.450 
enough that you'll start to remember
some<00:06:22.140> of<00:06:22.170> the<00:06:22.290> ones<00:06:22.440> you<00:06:22.530> came<00:06:22.710> across<00:06:22.860> and

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 
some of the ones you came across and

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.520 
some of the ones you came across and
you'll<00:06:23.820> start<00:06:24.060> memorizing<00:06:24.540> things<00:06:25.020> just

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:25.530 
you'll start memorizing things just

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:27.890 
you'll start memorizing things just
because<00:06:26.040> you<00:06:26.520> have<00:06:27.060> come<00:06:27.300> across<00:06:27.600> them<00:06:27.870> so

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:27.900 
because you have come across them so

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.620 
because you have come across them so
many<00:06:28.200> times<00:06:28.530> you<00:06:29.130> memorize<00:06:29.490> them<00:06:29.730> as<00:06:29.880> opposed

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:30.630 
many times you memorize them as opposed

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:32.720 
many times you memorize them as opposed
to<00:06:30.870> sitting<00:06:31.080> down<00:06:31.230> and<00:06:31.710> intentionally<00:06:32.430> just

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:32.730 
to sitting down and intentionally just

00:06:32.730 --> 00:06:35.660 
to sitting down and intentionally just
trying<00:06:33.000> to<00:06:33.300> kind<00:06:34.050> of<00:06:34.170> you<00:06:34.530> know<00:06:34.800> cram<00:06:35.130> like

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:35.670 
trying to kind of you know cram like

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:37.970 
trying to kind of you know cram like
you're<00:06:35.850> cramming<00:06:36.360> for<00:06:36.630> a<00:06:36.720> test<00:06:36.800> this<00:06:37.800> is<00:06:37.860> a

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:37.980 
you're cramming for a test this is a

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.980 
you're cramming for a test this is a
much<00:06:38.190> more<00:06:38.400> fun<00:06:38.640> way<00:06:38.670> to<00:06:38.820> try<00:06:39.720> and<00:06:39.750> memorize

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:39.990 
much more fun way to try and memorize

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:44.450 
much more fun way to try and memorize
notes<00:06:40.710> on<00:06:40.860> the<00:06:40.950> fretboard<00:06:41.070> so<00:06:41.490> give<00:06:42.300> it<00:06:42.330> a<00:06:42.420> shot
