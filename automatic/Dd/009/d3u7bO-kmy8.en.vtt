Jeep<00:00:25.710> has<00:00:25.920> given<00:00:26.279> this<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.670> six-speed

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
Jeep has given this a six-speed

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.090 
Jeep has given this a six-speed
automatic<00:00:28.260> transmission

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:29.100 
automatic transmission

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.040 
automatic transmission
replacing<00:00:29.850> the<00:00:29.939> constantly<00:00:30.449> variable

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
replacing the constantly variable

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.830 
replacing the constantly variable
transmission<00:00:31.170> or<00:00:31.920> CVT<00:00:32.099> that<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:33.120> had<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.600> take

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
transmission or CVT that you had to take

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.170 
transmission or CVT that you had to take
if<00:00:34.110> you<00:00:34.199> wanted<00:00:34.470> the<00:00:34.590> automatic<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.340> so<00:00:35.820> I

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
if you wanted the automatic and so I

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.790 
if you wanted the automatic and so I
really<00:00:36.750> thought<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:37.110> was<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.260> good<00:00:37.469> reason<00:00:37.620> to

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
really thought that was a good reason to

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.380 
really thought that was a good reason to
bring<00:00:38.010> one<00:00:38.160> out<00:00:38.190> for<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.550> new<00:00:38.700> test<00:00:38.969> drive<00:00:39.210> to

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
bring one out for a new test drive to

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.420 
bring one out for a new test drive to
see<00:00:39.570> how<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:39.809> did<00:00:39.930> because<00:00:40.350> in<00:00:40.469> 2011<00:00:41.280> when<00:00:41.399> we

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
see how it did because in 2011 when we

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.220 
see how it did because in 2011 when we
drove<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:41.940> we<00:00:42.270> had<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.420> lot<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.629> good<00:00:42.809> things<00:00:43.050> to

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
drove it we had a lot of good things to

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.020 
drove it we had a lot of good things to
say<00:00:43.260> about<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.770> Patriot<00:00:44.190> but<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.520> CVT

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
say about the Patriot but that CVT

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.880 
say about the Patriot but that CVT
really<00:00:45.930> was<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.110> buzzkill

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
really was a buzzkill

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.610 
really was a buzzkill
so<00:00:47.340> we<00:00:47.700> have<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.969> freedom<00:00:48.210> one<00:00:48.840> four<00:00:49.469> wheel

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
so we have the freedom one four wheel

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.410 
so we have the freedom one four wheel
drive<00:00:49.860> system<00:00:49.890> in<00:00:50.370> this<00:00:50.489> which<00:00:50.730> means<00:00:50.969> it's

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
drive system in this which means it's

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.569 
drive system in this which means it's
not<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.629> full-blown<00:00:52.200> off-road<00:00:52.800> drive<00:00:53.070> system

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
not the full-blown off-road drive system

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.750 
not the full-blown off-road drive system
but<00:00:54.090> even<00:00:54.390> this<00:00:55.260> basic<00:00:55.739> system<00:00:56.129> has<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.309> locking

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
but even this basic system has a locking

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.250 
but even this basic system has a locking
center<00:00:56.969> differential<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:57.870> can<00:00:58.050> use

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
center differential that you can use

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.020 
center differential that you can use
which<00:00:58.710> is<00:00:58.860> far<00:00:59.160> more<00:00:59.190> than<00:00:59.610> many<00:00:59.760> of<00:00:59.910> its

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030

when<00:05:07.520> I<00:05:07.550> drove<00:05:07.819> the<00:05:07.970> Patriot<00:05:08.449> before<00:05:08.780> I

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
when I drove the Patriot before I

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.809 
when I drove the Patriot before I
actually<00:05:09.169> liked<00:05:09.560> it<00:05:09.710> a<00:05:09.800> lot<00:05:09.949> the<00:05:10.190> handling<00:05:10.639> was

00:05:10.809 --> 00:05:10.819 
actually liked it a lot the handling was

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:13.540 
actually liked it a lot the handling was
good<00:05:11.090> surprising<00:05:12.080> for<00:05:12.289> its<00:05:12.379> price<00:05:12.680> range<00:05:12.889> but

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
good surprising for its price range but

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.839 
good surprising for its price range but
the<00:05:13.699> CVT<00:05:14.120> just<00:05:14.690> killed<00:05:15.139> the<00:05:15.620> buzz<00:05:15.889> of<00:05:16.220> course

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:16.849 
the CVT just killed the buzz of course

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:19.540 
the CVT just killed the buzz of course
that<00:05:17.840> sounds<00:05:18.020> like<00:05:18.259> an<00:05:18.409> oxymoron<00:05:18.560> because<00:05:19.430> it

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
that sounds like an oxymoron because it

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.309 
that sounds like an oxymoron because it
created<00:05:20.120> the<00:05:20.210> buzz<00:05:20.419> it<00:05:20.690> made<00:05:20.840> that<00:05:21.020> engine

00:05:21.309 --> 00:05:21.319 
created the buzz it made that engine

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:23.649 
created the buzz it made that engine
sound<00:05:21.560> like<00:05:21.680> a<00:05:21.710> leaf<00:05:22.099> blower<00:05:22.370> but<00:05:23.210> this<00:05:23.419> thing

00:05:23.649 --> 00:05:23.659 
sound like a leaf blower but this thing

00:05:23.659 --> 00:05:26.200 
sound like a leaf blower but this thing
just<00:05:23.690> has<00:05:24.020> a<00:05:24.050> lot<00:05:24.349> more<00:05:24.379> drivability<00:05:25.370> now<00:05:25.550> the

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
just has a lot more drivability now the

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.290 
just has a lot more drivability now the
shifting<00:05:26.690> works<00:05:26.960> pretty<00:05:27.289> well<00:05:27.440> and<00:05:28.180> the<00:05:29.180> only

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
shifting works pretty well and the only

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.790 
shifting works pretty well and the only
time<00:05:29.569> that<00:05:29.780> you're<00:05:29.900> going<00:05:30.020> to<00:05:30.080> lose<00:05:30.259> it<00:05:30.500> is<00:05:30.620> if

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 
time that you're going to lose it is if

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.830 
time that you're going to lose it is if
you<00:05:30.889> go<00:05:31.069> for<00:05:31.310> the<00:05:31.400> all-out<00:05:31.639> freedom<00:05:32.330> Drive<00:05:32.569> -

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840 
you go for the all-out freedom Drive -

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.619 
you go for the all-out freedom Drive -
which<00:05:33.110> still<00:05:33.349> comes<00:05:33.590> with<00:05:33.710> a<00:05:33.860> CVT<00:05:34.340> but<00:05:35.300> I<00:05:35.330> think

00:05:35.619 --> 00:05:35.629 
which still comes with a CVT but I think

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:38.559 
which still comes with a CVT but I think
GP<00:05:35.960> the<00:05:36.110> calculation<00:05:36.830> that<00:05:37.060> the<00:05:38.060> majority<00:05:38.360> of

00:05:38.559 --> 00:05:38.569 
GP the calculation that the majority of

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:39.640 
GP the calculation that the majority of
their<00:05:38.690> customers<00:05:39.110> are<00:05:39.169> going<00:05:39.319> to<00:05:39.440> go<00:05:39.530> with

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 
their customers are going to go with

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.020 
their customers are going to go with
either<00:05:39.770> front-wheel<00:05:40.190> drive<00:05:40.219> or<00:05:40.699> the<00:05:40.879> base

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:41.030 
either front-wheel drive or the base

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.240 
either front-wheel drive or the base
4-wheel<00:05:41.509> Drive<00:05:41.810> freedom<00:05:42.379> one<00:05:42.560> package<00:05:43.039> and

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
4-wheel Drive freedom one package and

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.219 
4-wheel Drive freedom one package and
therefore<00:05:43.940> that<00:05:44.150> six-speed<00:05:44.569> automatic<00:05:45.139> is

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:45.229 
therefore that six-speed automatic is

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:48.309 
therefore that six-speed automatic is
