 what fart batos today I teach you to create a 

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:12.010
 virus style animation and for that 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.050
 we will use a few programs the 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.750

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:19.240

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.500
 first we will open pivot after making your 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.500
 animation as they can or want 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:46.600
 it is exported by the image and as shown 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.600
 on the screen 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.300
 with all the boxes marked in 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.650
 the box above with value 100 and 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.650
 in the one below with only 1 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.860
 you can close it no problem 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.870
 after that they press the keyboard 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.470
 screen printing and after that 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.470
 open paint 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.960
 they stick it and then they can give it 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.560
 any change hide icons or 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.560
 some elements 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:31.860
 and they save it in png format since this 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.860
 high resolution 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.600

 after that they open the properties and 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.800
 they memorize or write the size of the 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:57.619
 image and I will tell you later why and for 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.619

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.610
 already after all that they open flash and you 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.520
 they give in exxon script 3 green a little more 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.770
 quickly, please 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.640
 and they name layer 1 by the name of 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.640
 background or whatever 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.269
 change the size of the fund by 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:26.340
 size they wrote or remembered and if 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:28.200
 they are not 1024 x 768 to see when you finish you 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.269
 they go to view of the whole window or scene 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.270
 and drag the image but in the box 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:39.300

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:41.520
 come on do not be so boring xd after 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.040
 that blocks the background layer and they create 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.930
 another one they change the name of the layer of 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.930
 up where the doll is going or live 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:54.400
 Put another musiquita no longer assholes 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.400
 bored with that 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.660
 already of that they go to library and 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.490
 they drag their pivot as seen in the 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.040
 video 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:10.490
 they select it and drag it again 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.080
 but now where is the background or image 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:15.440
 press the transformation button and 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.780
 they enlarge if they want 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.510
 then press in selection mode and 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.580
 we double click on the pivot and after 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.800
 that we tighten these two blue squares 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.810
 solids that you see here and after that 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.410
 they drag this dot until the end of 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:34.690
 the frames already of that select it 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.690
 everything and we press the control + b keys 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.709
 and we click on the magic wand of 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.470
 up and down and we just select 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.360
 the white part of the pivot but not only 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.060
 once but until the bottom is removed 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.050
 white no problem if you put your 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.050
 pivot is normal 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.550
 sometimes they will not pass this 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.440
 there is a problem they can remove it only 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:04.250
 selecting this white and squeezing 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.250
 delete or LED 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:10.690
 again they go to selection mode and 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.640
 name the layer as you want or 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.860
 create another layer and in this create a 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.310
 Enormous picture enough to cover 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.310
 to the pivot 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.620
 they go to selection mode and drag the 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.450
 layer up down and in the top layer 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:26.900
 we give right click and select 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:29.300
 mask as seen in the video already of the 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:31.400
 mask we click where it says scene 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:34.210
 or scene 1 and drag the pivot in the 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.210
 place they want 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.860
 after that they select a painting 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.260
 either in the timeline and 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.750
 create some frames with the keys f 6 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:50.030
 and in the frame the pivot you can 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.310
 drag it as seen in the video ah 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.689
 Of course, if your line is not like this, 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:57.119
 do nothing 

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:59.309
 they give right click to the line like this 

00:04:57.119 --> 00:05:01.110
 in the video and then they click on the 

00:04:59.309 --> 00:05:03.649
 third option that says create a 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.649
 interpolation 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.310
 already of that they go to library and they look for 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.650
 the background image 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:15.080
