I<00:00:15.049> think<00:00:16.049> things<00:00:16.560> like<00:00:16.680> this<00:00:16.740> theory<00:00:17.130> lunch<00:00:17.340> is

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
I think things like this theory lunch is

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.029 
I think things like this theory lunch is
a<00:00:17.520> great<00:00:17.670> example<00:00:17.760> of<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:19.080> how<00:00:19.529> important<00:00:19.830> is<00:00:20.010> to

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
a great example of a how important is to

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.400 
a great example of a how important is to
be<00:00:20.189> social<00:00:20.490> insights<00:00:20.789> you<00:00:20.850> have<00:00:21.000> lunch<00:00:21.210> before

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.410 
be social insights you have lunch before

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.720 
be social insights you have lunch before
it's<00:00:22.410> in<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.740> bright<00:00:22.920> room<00:00:23.070> everybody<00:00:23.460> can<00:00:23.580> see

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
it's in a bright room everybody can see

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.429 
it's in a bright room everybody can see
each<00:00:23.820> other<00:00:24.029> this<00:00:24.539> is<00:00:24.600> designed<00:00:25.050> very<00:00:25.230> well

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
each other this is designed very well

each other this is designed very well
body<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.160> mind<00:00:26.340> this<00:00:26.699> is<00:00:26.820> like<00:00:26.939> the

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
body and mind this is like the

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.429 
body and mind this is like the
subjective<00:00:27.570> side<00:00:27.720> of<00:00:27.810> science<00:00:27.990> in<00:00:28.080> mind<00:00:28.289> just

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
subjective side of science in mind just

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.259 
subjective side of science in mind just
talk<00:00:28.680> this<00:00:28.859> kind<00:00:29.099> of<00:00:29.220> so<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.699> blackboards<00:00:30.150> are

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
talk this kind of so the blackboards are

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.410 
talk this kind of so the blackboards are
you<00:00:30.779> have<00:00:30.869> something<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.199> discuss<00:00:31.289> afterwards

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:32.420 
you have something to discuss afterwards

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.610 
you have something to discuss afterwards
and<00:00:33.420> I<00:00:33.510> think<00:00:33.719> it's<00:00:33.809> very<00:00:33.960> important<00:00:34.440> because

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
and I think it's very important because

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.319 
and I think it's very important because
in<00:00:35.370> those<00:00:35.760> off<00:00:36.750> hours<00:00:37.320> or<00:00:37.980> I<00:00:38.430> think<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.180> get<00:00:39.300> a

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
in those off hours or I think to get a

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.670 
in those off hours or I think to get a
good<00:00:39.450> scientific<00:00:39.719> idea<00:00:40.020> i<00:00:40.079> notice<00:00:40.469> you<00:00:40.590> have

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
good scientific idea i notice you have

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.260 
good scientific idea i notice you have
to<00:00:40.739> be<00:00:40.829> bored<00:00:41.100> you<00:00:41.850> have<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.090> give<00:00:42.210> yourself

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
to be bored you have to give yourself

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.330 
to be bored you have to give yourself
the<00:00:42.570> opportunity<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:43.140> be<00:00:43.230> bored<00:00:43.500> tell<00:00:44.160> me<00:00:44.280> if

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
the opportunity to be bored tell me if

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.650 
the opportunity to be bored tell me if
it<00:00:44.460> goes<00:00:44.610> opportunity<00:00:45.180> have<00:00:45.270> time<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.510> listen

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
it goes opportunity have time to listen

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.740 
it goes opportunity have time to listen
to<00:00:45.840> somebody<00:00:46.110> with<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.530> crazy<00:00:47.450> so<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.480> could
