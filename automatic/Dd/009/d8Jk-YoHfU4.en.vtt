would<00:03:15.410> make<00:03:15.560> videos<00:03:15.920> but<00:03:16.340> there<00:03:16.489> would<00:03:16.610> barely

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
would make videos but there would barely

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.610 
would make videos but there would barely
be<00:03:16.970> any<00:03:17.209> increases<00:03:17.690> in<00:03:17.840> my<00:03:17.959> staff<00:03:18.230> because<00:03:18.500> I

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
be any increases in my staff because I

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.229 
be any increases in my staff because I
was<00:03:18.769> just<00:03:18.860> like<00:03:19.070> so<00:03:19.340> hard<00:03:19.610> pulling<00:03:19.820> league<00:03:20.060> at

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
was just like so hard pulling league at

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.100 
was just like so hard pulling league at
the<00:03:20.269> time<00:03:20.650> but<00:03:21.650> and<00:03:22.510> for<00:03:23.510> videos<00:03:23.780> for<00:03:23.989> leak

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
the time but and for videos for leak

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:25.449 
the time but and for videos for leak
that's<00:03:24.290> probably<00:03:24.620> not<00:03:24.739> gonna<00:03:24.890> happen<00:03:24.980> I<00:03:25.430> mean

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
that's probably not gonna happen I mean

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.370 
that's probably not gonna happen I mean
I<00:03:25.670> know<00:03:25.700> I'm<00:03:26.300> sure<00:03:26.570> some<00:03:26.780> of<00:03:26.870> you<00:03:26.900> guys<00:03:27.050> want<00:03:27.320> to

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610
