pack there you have it and now we're

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:42.340 
pack there you have it and now we're
just<00:01:31.920> putting<00:01:32.250> on<00:01:32.429> the<00:01:32.670> tres

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.350 

now<00:01:43.250> that<00:01:43.430> we're<00:01:43.550> finished<00:01:43.850> with<00:01:44.030> the<00:01:44.120> chassis

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
now that we're finished with the chassis

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.480 
now that we're finished with the chassis
and<00:01:44.720> motors<00:01:45.260> here<00:01:45.500> we're<00:01:46.250> gonna<00:01:46.430> need

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
and motors here we're gonna need

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.280 
and motors here we're gonna need
something<00:01:46.700> to<00:01:46.909> control<00:01:47.210> it<00:01:47.420> so<00:01:48.080> we're<00:01:48.170> gonna

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
something to control it so we're gonna

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.680 
something to control it so we're gonna
be<00:01:48.409> using<00:01:48.530> the<00:01:48.800> Fischer<00:01:49.370> technique<00:01:49.729> Robo<00:01:50.300> TX

there<00:02:35.230> you<00:02:35.290> have<00:02:35.470> it<00:02:35.799> now<00:02:36.310> we're<00:02:36.489> gonna

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
there you have it now we're gonna

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.530 
there you have it now we're gonna
program<00:02:37.030> it

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.539 

here's<00:02:43.540> another<00:02:43.659> robot<00:02:44.140> we're<00:02:44.409> building<00:02:45.190> here

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
here's another robot we're building here

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:49.080 
here's another robot we're building here
it's<00:02:46.330> from<00:02:46.720> the<00:02:47.019> Fischer<00:02:47.409> technique<00:02:47.760> Robo<00:02:48.760> TX

it's from the Fischer technique Robo TX

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.960 
it's from the Fischer technique Robo TX
training<00:02:49.450> lab<00:02:50.099> and<00:02:51.099> with<00:02:51.220> this<00:02:51.370> model<00:02:51.790> over

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
training lab and with this model over

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.390 
training lab and with this model over
here<00:02:52.170> we<00:02:53.170> were<00:02:53.230> able<00:02:53.319> to<00:02:53.470> make<00:02:53.680> 11<00:02:54.069> different

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
here we were able to make 11 different

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:04.470 
here we were able to make 11 different
models<00:02:54.730> in<00:02:58.590> there<00:03:02.819> so<00:03:03.819> when<00:03:03.940> you<00:03:04.000> first<00:03:04.209> launch

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
models in there so when you first launch

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.900 
models in there so when you first launch
the<00:03:04.750> Robo<00:03:05.319> pearl<00:03:05.620> software<00:03:06.459> you'll<00:03:06.670> probably

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
the Robo pearl software you'll probably

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.690 
the Robo pearl software you'll probably
have<00:03:07.720> to<00:03:07.930> get<00:03:08.170> a<00:03:08.230> firmware<00:03:08.739> update<00:03:09.069> just<00:03:09.549> like

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
have to get a firmware update just like

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.819 
have to get a firmware update just like
what<00:03:09.879> we're<00:03:10.060> doing<00:03:10.239> now<00:03:10.560> it's<00:03:11.560> gonna<00:03:11.739> take

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:11.829 
what we're doing now it's gonna take

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:18.839 
what we're doing now it's gonna take
just<00:03:11.980> a<00:03:12.370> few<00:03:12.400> minutes<00:03:17.459> once<00:03:18.459> you've<00:03:18.609> done<00:03:18.790> your

00:03:18.839 --> 00:03:18.849 
just a few minutes once you've done your

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:21.509 
just a few minutes once you've done your
firmware<00:03:19.420> update<00:03:19.780> you<00:03:20.019> can<00:03:20.230> now<00:03:20.440> use<00:03:20.709> the<00:03:20.739> test

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
firmware update you can now use the test

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.390 
firmware update you can now use the test
interface<00:03:21.819> dialog<00:03:22.920> while<00:03:23.920> you're<00:03:24.069> in<00:03:24.190> here

interface dialog while you're in here

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.940 
interface dialog while you're in here
you<00:03:24.489> can<00:03:24.670> use<00:03:24.900> this<00:03:25.900> to<00:03:26.109> test<00:03:26.319> your<00:03:26.590> inputs<00:03:26.890> and

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
you can use this to test your inputs and

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.289 
you can use this to test your inputs and
outputs<00:03:28.200> with<00:03:29.200> lights<00:03:29.609> buzzers<00:03:30.609> and<00:03:31.090> the

outputs with lights buzzers and the

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:39.199 
outputs with lights buzzers and the
motors<00:03:33.989> now<00:03:34.989> we<00:03:35.049> can<00:03:35.319> use<00:03:35.500> our<00:03:36.090> trail<00:03:37.090> sensor

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
motors now we can use our trail sensor

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.770 
motors now we can use our trail sensor
let's<00:03:40.209> just<00:03:40.419> find<00:03:40.690> it<00:03:40.870> here<00:03:42.299> trail<00:03:43.299> search<00:03:43.599> or

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
let's just find it here trail search or

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.339 
let's just find it here trail search or
to

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:48.349
