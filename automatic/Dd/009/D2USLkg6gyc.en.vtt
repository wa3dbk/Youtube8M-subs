00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.269
 here 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.769
 many of you Had you asked us 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:18.050
 so we bring you a little 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:20.560
 Comparison between mechanical keyboards and 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.560
 membrane 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.180
 we had on our channel's reviews 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.940
 of the 710 plus gene 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:34.590
 the 2000 gb 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:35.760
 or the unboxing of genesis rx 88 of the 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.180
 that we leave you a link in the 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.130
 description 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.750
 so to complete this little 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.790
 selection we bring you a small 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.650
 Comparison between mechanical keyboards and 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.860
 membrane 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.600
 we have chosen for her the corsa el 70 and 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.840
 the black widow of razer in the part 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.550
 mechanical and the logitech 105 for the 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.800
 membrane part 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.300
 as many of you will already know the 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.300
 keyboards that we found more 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.129
 The membrane types are common 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.869
 The last one is made of rubber for 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.050
 capture thus the pulsation that we bring to 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:08.420
 cape 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.160
 this type of keyboards are characterized 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.930
 for a lower noise level and in 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.000
 especially those oriented to gaming 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.640
 have a low profile for a 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.560
 faster pulsation 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.080
 On the other hand we find the 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.970
 mechanical keyboards these incorporate 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.640
 switchers that do not need to be pressed 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.140
 completely to send the signal in addition 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.150
 thanks to the fact that there are many 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.740
 switches or pushbuttons we have more 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:32.720
 Choice of keyboard 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.830
 with what we can find one that is 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.830
 adapt better to our needs 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.520
 the most appreciated by gamers are 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.080
 the red and black switches though 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.790
 lately a certain 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.160
 irruption of the blue model 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.780
 with respect to g 105 is one of the 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.140
 most popular keyboards thanks to their 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.100
 remarkable benefits and adjusted price 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.780
 highlight details like your 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.030
 backlight adjustable in intensity 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.850
 or your macro keys with up to three 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.979
 different profiles 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.509
 thanks to the software that includes we can 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.320
 customize up to a total of 18 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:07.630
 exclusive functions per game 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.490
 Other aspects that stand out are its 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.290
 wash keys or the possibility of 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.480
 disable the windows key 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.250
 k 70 is made entirely 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.000
 aluminum and all its keys are 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.980
 mechanical with cherry red push buttons 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.380
 has recriminations red 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.570
 with a remarkable intensity and includes a 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.190
 wide and comfortable wrist rest that you 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.290
 will allow you to be now sitting in front of 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.100
 him in a comfortable way and without 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.930
 our fingers suffer 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.970
 this cassette in is oriented so much 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.670
 for the more gamers as they denote 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.230
 his keys were one two six as for the 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.550
 who use it only for tasks 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.710
 common as writers or programmers 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.060
 in short, a keyboard that overflows 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.630
 quality and that will fulfill our 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.630
 expectations 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.769
 besides the 70 k could not miss in this 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.560
 review one of the brands for gamers by 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:03:00.020
 excellence 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.700
 the black widow of razer is finished with 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.920
 a great construction and it comes with 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:07.080
 cherry blue technology which reacts 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.750
 to pressure in a faster way 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.160
 also once we press it we will notice a 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.110
 small clip that will notify us of the 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.060
 pulsation 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.170
 this will make it a more keyboard 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.170
 noisy than that of its competitors 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.560
 with regard to cherry blue technology 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.620
 is the most similar in terms of 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.569
 resistance to membrane keyboards 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.129
 it's straight lit with a high 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.230
 luminosity even in environments 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:32.000
 contaminated and has a usb port 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.989
 and connectors for microphone and 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.970
 headphones all gold-plated 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:41.580
 It also includes five macro keys 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.440
 so three fantastic keyboards that 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.650
 enjoy advantages and disadvantages almost 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.989
 same 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.180
 maybe so that the xerez 105 was more 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:51.220
 complete would have been more appropriate than 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.680
 was that slim guy because this way to 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.269
 we will cut the pulse time another 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:58.200
 important detail would have been the 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:58.200
 inclusion of wrist rests 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.780
 anyway and apart from all this 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.580
 its fantastic price and lots of 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.730
 functions will make it an option to have in 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.730
 account 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.360
 on the other side we find the 70 k and the 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.070
 black widow these have a 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.380
 main disadvantage with respect to g 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:17.959
 105 and is that they are well above 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.760
 This makes us wonder if 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:23.080
 the quality per euro invested is a 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.080
 factor really to keep in mind 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.820
 from pc components and especially 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.560
 taking into account the opinions of 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.260
 our users our recommendation 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.240
 it's positive it's about keyboards with a 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.529
 great manufacture and finishes besides 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.169
 have a longer life 

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:40.909
 maybe for example the cassette lacks 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.459
 of macros or do not incorporate connectors 

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:45.469
 plated in gold or that the black widow does not 

00:04:43.459 --> 00:04:47.509
 have wrist rests or more variety 

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:49.339
 of lighting colors but of what 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:51.499
 There is no doubt that both keyboards 

00:04:49.339 --> 00:04:54.739
 They are of exceptional quality and very 

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:55.969
 Complete the choice is yours all 

00:04:54.739 --> 00:04:59.289
 will depend on the needs and 

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:59.289
 possibilities that you have
