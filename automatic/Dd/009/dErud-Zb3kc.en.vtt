00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:55.099 
sometimes like in the flight kill when I

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:56.620 
sometimes like in the flight kill when I
was<00:02:55.250> doing<00:02:55.370> that<00:02:55.579> you<00:02:55.940> could<00:02:56.090> be<00:02:56.209> fighting<00:02:56.420> a

jad and you could hit like 400 400 400
400<00:03:00.290> and<00:03:00.799> then<00:03:01.220> you'd<00:03:01.370> come<00:03:01.489> across<00:03:01.760> another

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
400 and then you'd come across another

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.559 
400 and then you'd come across another
jad<00:03:02.299> and<00:03:02.510> you<00:03:03.079> just<00:03:03.260> hit<00:03:03.410> 20<00:03:04.220> zeros<00:03:04.790> all

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569
