00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
number four is very unpopular in China

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:17.819 
number four is very unpopular in China
I'm<00:03:16.629> pretty<00:03:16.870> sure<00:03:17.079> because<00:03:17.409> it<00:03:17.530> sounds

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
I'm pretty sure because it sounds

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:19.770 
I'm pretty sure because it sounds
similar<00:03:18.010> to<00:03:18.189> the<00:03:18.430> word<00:03:18.579> death<00:03:18.909> the<00:03:19.450> ways<00:03:19.599> that

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
similar to the word death the ways that

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.869 
similar to the word death the ways that
number<00:03:20.079> four<00:03:20.290> is<00:03:20.469> so<00:03:20.769> the<00:03:21.370> waiting<00:03:21.609> to<00:03:21.700> say

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:21.879 
number four is so the waiting to say

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:24.690 
number four is so the waiting to say
death<00:03:22.150> is<00:03:22.390> so<00:03:22.840> so<00:03:23.560> they're<00:03:24.189> pretty<00:03:24.519> similar

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
death is so so they're pretty similar

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.240 
death is so so they're pretty similar
and<00:03:25.090> you<00:03:26.049> know<00:03:26.170> the<00:03:26.349> number<00:03:26.469> for<00:03:26.620> he's<00:03:27.069> like

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
and you know the number for he's like

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.280 
and you know the number for he's like
that<00:03:27.430> friend<00:03:27.849> that<00:03:28.150> you<00:03:28.599> need<00:03:28.900> to<00:03:29.109> complete

that friend that you need to complete
the<00:03:29.739> sequence<00:03:29.980> but<00:03:30.670> you<00:03:30.760> don't<00:03:30.939> really<00:03:31.090> like

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:31.359 
the sequence but you don't really like

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:33.899 
the sequence but you don't really like
that<00:03:31.540> much<00:03:31.810> so<00:03:32.409> he<00:03:32.709> gets<00:03:32.950> left<00:03:33.280> out<00:03:33.459> of<00:03:33.519> a<00:03:33.730> lot
