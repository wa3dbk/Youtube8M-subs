00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
 Closet full of secrets and skeletons awakes but nothing's true Many secrets and skeletons have awakened, but they have no truth. 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:01.660
 I used to own a castle now, but I have to move. 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.100
 Right here in the darkness There's nothing left for me in this darkness 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.780
 It's easier to run away, but today is a chance.

 Cast the shadows out from sight 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.040
 A final stand a shouting cry 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.740
 All the wrongs are now turned to right. 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.500

 Bridges burned and broken in different directions we start anew We have to start a new one. 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:19.160
 Being chased by monsters to face head on or be consumed 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.220
 Reaching out for something to grasp on to nothing to lose 

00:02:27.793 --> 00:02:33.453
