00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:05.589
Warning. The following recipe contains non-specific
amounts.

00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:11.280
Terminology such as "parts" and "smidges"
will be used and you will be expected to fine

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:18.280
tune your own rub.
BBQ with Franklin does not condone or promote such 
seriousness regarding BBQ.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.060
You know a rub is an integral part of BBQ.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.436
You can go to the store, you can buy all kinds of different rubs. 

00:00:29.436 --> 00:00:30.560
or you can just make your own!

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.503
They're really not very hard. So today we're gonna kinda make an evolving rub.

00:00:35.503 --> 00:00:39.340
Onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, salt and pepper. some sugar. 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.100
so I'm going to start with a base

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.600
pepper

00:00:45.101 --> 00:00:48.301
We're going to do the same amount of kosher salt. 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:56.079
So this is my basic brisket rub: half kosher salt and half black pepper.

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:03.079

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:03.579
What makes it "evolving" is you can actually add onion powder, garlic powder, some savory aspects if you want.

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:06.774
so for brisket got a little bit of onion powder here. 

00:01:07.578 --> 00:01:11.018
I put just barely enough where you can just taste it.

00:01:11.018 --> 00:01:15.760
A little bit of garlic powder. So this is becoming more of a "Texasy" brisket rub. 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.630
Might also be good for some other things. Put a little bit of chili powder in it.

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:30.709
And this would be great for brisket OR it'd be good for shoulder butt. AKA pulled pork.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.480
If I was going to make pulled pork I'd add a little Hungarian paprika. 

00:01:37.993 --> 00:01:40.953
This will add some color. Not a lot of flavor.

00:01:41.113 --> 00:01:45.513
But it's great for pulled pork. Give you a nice red mahogany color. 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.000
I would also add a little bit of dry mustard

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.980
This gets you a little more on the savory side. A little bit of balance in there.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.620
But if I was going to make pork ribs I'd add a little bit of pepper.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.519
Since ribs are really thin, you don't want too much salt. So I'm going to double up the black pepper.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.120
So this is a great rub for pork ribs. But to turn it to a chicken rub

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.780
just add a little bit of brown sugar. 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.980
adds a little molassesy flavor to it.

00:02:25.314 --> 00:02:28.594
You can also add white sugar. I prefer brown sugar 

00:02:28.594 --> 00:02:30.718
So here's why I wouldn't add any sugar for brisket, pulled pork or ribs, since those are really long cooks

00:02:30.775 --> 00:02:34.260
sugar has a tendency to burn. But Chicken is a quick cook and 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.760
I think chicken could really benefit from a little sweetness too. 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:41.760

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:42.260
So this is an "evolving rub." 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.910
It starts off with salt and pepper really good for brisket, but as you add other things it also becomes good for other cuts of meat.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.100
You could use as much of this rub as you like. I prefer to go a little bit lighter
