camera body testing and I want to do

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.370 
camera body testing and I want to do
second<00:00:08.730> one<00:00:08.820> because<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.300> first<00:00:09.570> one<00:00:09.719> I<00:00:10.139> had

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
second one because the first one I had

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.100 
second one because the first one I had
manufactured<00:00:11.010> the<00:00:11.820> lighting<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.420> a<00:00:12.450> complete

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
manufactured the lighting to a complete

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.560 
manufactured the lighting to a complete
extreme<00:00:13.710> and<00:00:13.980> what<00:00:14.099> we<00:00:14.250> had<00:00:14.429> done<00:00:14.639> with<00:00:14.969> Monica

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
extreme and what we had done with Monica

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.070 
extreme and what we had done with Monica
was<00:00:16.170> we<00:00:16.350> had<00:00:16.560> her<00:00:16.740> wear<00:00:16.980> black<00:00:17.310> shirt<00:00:17.699> and<00:00:18.080> dark

was we had her wear black shirt and dark
jeans<00:00:19.310> and<00:00:20.310> I<00:00:20.400> wanted<00:00:20.730> primarily<00:00:21.359> to<00:00:21.510> show<00:00:21.779> you

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
jeans and I wanted primarily to show you

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.439 
jeans and I wanted primarily to show you
guys<00:00:22.020> why<00:00:22.590> there's<00:00:22.949> a<00:00:23.070> lot<00:00:23.699> of<00:00:23.730> digital<00:00:24.269> noise

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
guys why there's a lot of digital noise

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.359 
guys why there's a lot of digital noise
that<00:00:24.750> shows<00:00:25.050> up<00:00:25.260> in<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.500> shadows<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.279> the

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
that shows up in the shadows and the

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.929 
that shows up in the shadows and the
dark<00:00:27.330> clothing<00:00:27.779> in<00:00:28.230> digital<00:00:29.039> files<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.820> it's

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
dark clothing in digital files and it's

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.700 
dark clothing in digital files and it's
something<00:00:30.179> that<00:00:30.330> digital<00:00:30.869> sensors<00:00:31.320> won't<00:00:31.560> be

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
something that digital sensors won't be

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.060 
something that digital sensors won't be
able<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:31.980> correct<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:33.140> film<00:00:34.140> actually<00:00:34.530> can't

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
able to correct and film actually can't

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.069 
able to correct and film actually can't
even<00:00:35.340> achieve<00:00:35.790> what<00:00:36.059> were<00:00:36.270> able<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.660> do<00:00:36.870> now

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
even achieve what were able to do now

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.260 
even achieve what were able to do now
but<00:00:37.739> it's<00:00:37.860> just<00:00:38.040> something<00:00:38.399> for<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:38.670> guys<00:00:39.030> to

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
but it's just something for you guys to

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.670 
but it's just something for you guys to
have<00:00:39.390> an<00:00:39.540> idea<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:39.930> so<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.410> when<00:00:40.530> you're

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
have an idea of so that when you're

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.889 
have an idea of so that when you're
doing<00:00:40.980> polls<00:00:41.219> production<00:00:41.850> you're<00:00:42.450> able<00:00:42.780> to

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
doing polls production you're able to

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.490 
doing polls production you're able to
make<00:00:43.200> some<00:00:43.500> changes<00:00:43.770> in<00:00:44.690> Photoshop<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:45.930> that

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
make some changes in Photoshop and that

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.410 
make some changes in Photoshop and that
your<00:00:46.649> understanding<00:00:46.770> what<00:00:47.550> layers<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:48.180> need

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
your understanding what layers you need

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.209 
your understanding what layers you need
to<00:00:48.570> actually<00:00:48.719> change<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.590> so<00:00:49.710> what<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:49.980> want

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
to actually change and so what you want

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.889 
to actually change and so what you want
to<00:00:50.340> change<00:00:50.610> is<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.879> dark<00:00:51.239> areas<00:00:51.719> because

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
to change is the dark areas because

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.240 
to change is the dark areas because
that's<00:00:52.050> where<00:00:52.289> you'll<00:00:52.440> find<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.890> digital

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
that's where you'll find the digital

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.430 
that's where you'll find the digital
noise<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:54.360> tonight<00:00:54.690> what<00:00:54.870> I've<00:00:54.989> done<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.289> I've

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
noise so tonight what I've done is I've

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.990 
noise so tonight what I've done is I've
done<00:00:55.680> another<00:00:55.949> different<00:00:56.309> scenario<00:00:56.730> with

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
done another different scenario with

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.770 
done another different scenario with
Susie<00:00:57.600> here<00:00:57.809> as<00:00:57.930> my<00:00:58.079> model<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:59.390> this<00:01:00.390> is<00:01:00.600> the

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
Susie here as my model and this is the

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.990 
Susie here as my model and this is the
main<00:01:01.050> portrait<00:01:01.620> area<00:01:01.980> that's<00:01:02.280> probably<00:01:02.760> the

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
main portrait area that's probably the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.140 
main portrait area that's probably the
most<00:01:03.210> realistic<00:01:03.809> for<00:01:04.290> all<00:01:04.530> portraiture<00:01:05.250> we're

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
most realistic for all portraiture we're

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.719 
most realistic for all portraiture we're
seldom<00:01:06.659> going<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.110> see<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.619> really<00:01:08.250> intense

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
seldom going to see the really intense

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.210 
seldom going to see the really intense
lighting<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:09.990> put<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.619> cameras<00:01:11.010> through

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
lighting that I put the cameras through

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.760 
lighting that I put the cameras through
the<00:01:11.340> first<00:01:11.580> time<00:01:11.880> in<00:01:12.810> this<00:01:12.990> situation<00:01:13.380> what

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
the first time in this situation what

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.920 
the first time in this situation what
we've<00:01:13.950> done<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.250> I<00:01:14.369> but<00:01:14.670> again<00:01:15.210> I<00:01:15.240> shot

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
we've done is I but again I shot

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.050 
we've done is I but again I shot
handheld<00:01:16.470> doesn't<00:01:17.250> one<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.400> you<00:01:17.549> guys<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.850> see

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
handheld doesn't one of you guys to see

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.880 
handheld doesn't one of you guys to see
what<00:01:18.299> it's<00:01:18.420> like<00:01:18.600> shooting<00:01:18.869> handheld<00:01:19.320> at<00:01:19.650> such

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
what it's like shooting handheld at such

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.030 
what it's like shooting handheld at such
low<00:01:20.159> environments<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.030> we've<00:01:21.840> used<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.320> single

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
low environments and we've used a single

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.880 
low environments and we've used a single
light<00:01:23.220> source<00:01:23.250> again<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:25.290> while<00:01:25.500> my<00:01:25.650> white

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
light source again and so while my white

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.499 
light source again and so while my white
balance<00:01:26.369> on<00:01:26.549> all<00:01:26.729> three<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.150> camera

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
balance on all three of the camera

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.350 
balance on all three of the camera
bodies<00:01:27.810> i<00:01:27.960> use<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.320> incandescent<00:01:29.060> light<00:01:30.060> bulb

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
bodies i use the incandescent light bulb

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.450 
bodies i use the incandescent light bulb
for<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.750> white<00:01:30.930> balance<00:01:31.170> so<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:32.009> want<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.280> set

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
for the white balance so you want to set

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.740 
for the white balance so you want to set
that<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.180> you'll<00:01:33.270> get<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.540> right

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
that to that and you'll get the right

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.910 
that to that and you'll get the right
color<00:01:33.960> tone<00:01:35.150> also<00:01:36.150> for<00:01:36.390> Susie<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:37.229> had<00:01:37.710> her

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
color tone also for Susie I I had her

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.620 
color tone also for Susie I I had her
sit<00:01:38.310> this<00:01:38.490> way<00:01:38.729> because<00:01:38.909> I'm<00:01:39.210> getting<00:01:39.509> the

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
sit this way because I'm getting the

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.359 
sit this way because I'm getting the
most<00:01:39.780> amount<00:01:40.079> of<00:01:40.229> light<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.680> it's<00:01:41.070> crossing

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
most amount of light and it's crossing

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.399 
most amount of light and it's crossing
her<00:01:41.759> body<00:01:41.970> so<00:01:42.299> we're<00:01:42.689> going<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.869> actually<00:01:43.079> get

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
her body so we're going to actually get

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.010 
her body so we're going to actually get
a<00:01:43.439> really<00:01:43.799> good<00:01:43.829> ratio<00:01:44.189> of<00:01:44.670> light<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.210> the

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
a really good ratio of light and the

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.109 
a really good ratio of light and the
shadow<00:01:46.350> side<00:01:46.680> again<00:01:47.100> this<00:01:47.280> is<00:01:47.460> really<00:01:47.700> harsh

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
shadow side again this is really harsh

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.200 
shadow side again this is really harsh
lighting<00:01:48.479> so<00:01:49.290> in<00:01:49.530> typical<00:01:49.710> portraiture<00:01:50.640> what

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
lighting so in typical portraiture what

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.030 
lighting so in typical portraiture what
we<00:01:51.360> want<00:01:51.600> is<00:01:51.780> from<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.200> light<00:01:52.409> side<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:52.950> the

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
we want is from the light side of the

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.850 
we want is from the light side of the
shadow<00:01:53.310> side<00:01:53.670> all<00:01:54.030> we<00:01:54.390> want<00:01:54.630> is<00:01:54.720> three<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.649> one

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
shadow side all we want is three to one

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.649 
shadow side all we want is three to one
ratio<00:01:55.890> that's<00:01:56.729> kind<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.090> what<00:01:57.270> we're<00:01:57.420> wanting

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
ratio that's kind of what we're wanting

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.359 
ratio that's kind of what we're wanting
and<00:01:58.079> so<00:01:59.149> for<00:02:00.149> this<00:02:00.299> case<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:01.079> actual<00:02:01.649> ratio

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
and so for this case the actual ratio

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.120 
and so for this case the actual ratio
here<00:02:02.939> is<00:02:03.090> probably<00:02:03.540> one<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:04.049> five<00:02:04.409> so<00:02:04.920> it's<00:02:05.070> a

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
here is probably one to five so it's a

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.010 
here is probably one to five so it's a
little<00:02:05.159> bit<00:02:05.579> more<00:02:05.909> intense<00:02:06.329> it's<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.719> little

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
little bit more intense it's a little

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.840 
little bit more intense it's a little
bit<00:02:07.140> edgier

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
bit edgier

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.809 
bit edgier
what<00:02:08.509> we<00:02:08.630> would<00:02:08.780> normally<00:02:08.990> want<00:02:09.410> but<00:02:10.340> this<00:02:10.490> is

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
what we would normally want but this is

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.809 
what we would normally want but this is
and<00:02:11.209> it<00:02:11.600> can<00:02:11.930> be<00:02:11.959> quite<00:02:12.590> a<00:02:12.620> practical<00:02:13.400> seen<00:02:13.790> a

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
and it can be quite a practical seen a

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.449 
and it can be quite a practical seen a
more<00:02:14.150> realistic<00:02:14.660> portrait<00:02:15.290> seen<00:02:15.500> in<00:02:16.069> real

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:16.459 
more realistic portrait seen in real

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.220 
more realistic portrait seen in real
life<00:02:16.730> what<00:02:16.970> I<00:02:17.000> probably<00:02:17.360> would<00:02:17.780> have<00:02:17.840> done<00:02:18.020> is

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
life what I probably would have done is

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.710 
life what I probably would have done is
bring<00:02:18.500> in<00:02:18.560> a<00:02:18.830> white<00:02:19.160> card<00:02:19.520> about<00:02:19.819> right<00:02:20.150> here

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
bring in a white card about right here

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.840 
bring in a white card about right here
to<00:02:21.080> bounce<00:02:21.380> some<00:02:21.530> light<00:02:21.980> up<00:02:22.220> on<00:02:22.430> the<00:02:22.520> shadow

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
to bounce some light up on the shadow

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.180 
to bounce some light up on the shadow
side<00:02:23.239> and<00:02:23.600> then<00:02:24.080> that<00:02:24.290> would<00:02:24.440> probably<00:02:24.709> bring

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
side and then that would probably bring

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.490 
side and then that would probably bring
me<00:02:25.370> back<00:02:25.610> to<00:02:25.640> a<00:02:25.880> three<00:02:26.180> to<00:02:26.270> one<00:02:26.480> ratio<00:02:26.510> so

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
me back to a three to one ratio so

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.160 
me back to a three to one ratio so
that's<00:02:27.650> an<00:02:27.800> idea<00:02:28.220> even<00:02:28.610> a<00:02:29.000> silver<00:02:29.600> reflector

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
that's an idea even a silver reflector

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.260 
that's an idea even a silver reflector
so<00:02:30.770> just<00:02:30.980> to<00:02:31.069> show<00:02:31.250> you<00:02:31.310> guys<00:02:31.430> in<00:02:31.819> terms<00:02:32.000> of<00:02:32.150> my

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
so just to show you guys in terms of my

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
so just to show you guys in terms of my
meter<00:02:32.540> and<00:02:32.750> again<00:02:33.760> we<00:02:34.760> started<00:02:35.660> off<00:02:35.810> at<00:02:36.110> eight

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
meter and again we started off at eight

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.170 
meter and again we started off at eight
hundred<00:02:36.319> I<00:02:36.739> so<00:02:37.069> again<00:02:37.370> for<00:02:37.400> all<00:02:37.700> three<00:02:38.000> of<00:02:38.030> the

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
hundred I so again for all three of the

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:41.110 
hundred I so again for all three of the
counter<00:02:38.480> bodies<00:02:38.840> and<00:02:39.370> if<00:02:40.370> I<00:02:40.519> meter<00:02:40.790> right<00:02:41.090> here

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
counter bodies and if I meter right here

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.360 
counter bodies and if I meter right here
at<00:02:41.420> the<00:02:41.510> face<00:02:41.720> pointing<00:02:42.200> towards<00:02:42.590> camera<00:02:42.950> and

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
at the face pointing towards camera and

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.979 
at the face pointing towards camera and
where<00:02:43.640> the<00:02:43.790> cameras<00:02:44.180> video<00:02:44.450> in<00:02:44.630> right<00:02:44.810> now

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
where the cameras video in right now

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.590 
where the cameras video in right now
that's<00:02:45.260> where<00:02:45.470> I<00:02:45.500> stood<00:02:45.860> what<00:02:46.819> i<00:02:46.850> get<00:02:47.180> is<00:02:47.209> this

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
that's where I stood what i get is this

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.979 
that's where I stood what i get is this
I<00:02:47.810> get<00:02:48.500> a<00:02:48.530> 1.4<00:02:49.340> out<00:02:49.610> of<00:02:49.760> thirtieth<00:02:50.209> of<00:02:50.330> a<00:02:50.540> second

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
I get a 1.4 out of thirtieth of a second

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:57.220 
I get a 1.4 out of thirtieth of a second
and<00:02:52.480> so<00:02:53.480> basically<00:02:53.870> I<00:02:54.319> shot<00:02:54.800> at<00:02:55.010> 28<00:02:55.930> litre<00:02:56.930> that

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
and so basically I shot at 28 litre that

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.090 
and so basically I shot at 28 litre that
again<00:02:57.580> so<00:02:58.580> at<00:02:58.819> 28<00:02:59.420> at<00:02:59.750> 800<00:03:00.470> I<00:03:00.560> so<00:03:00.920> I'm<00:03:01.040> getting

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
again so at 28 at 800 I so I'm getting

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.460 
again so at 28 at 800 I so I'm getting
one<00:03:01.850> eighth<00:03:02.120> of<00:03:02.420> a<00:03:02.540> second<00:03:03.049> so<00:03:03.290> that's

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
one eighth of a second so that's

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.320 
one eighth of a second so that's
extremely<00:03:04.130> low<00:03:04.489> alright<00:03:05.450> guys<00:03:06.010> I'm<00:03:07.010> also<00:03:07.819> what

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
extremely low alright guys I'm also what

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.830 
extremely low alright guys I'm also what
you<00:03:08.360> want<00:03:08.660> to<00:03:08.750> think<00:03:08.840> of<00:03:09.140> is<00:03:10.000> as<00:03:11.000> your<00:03:11.360> as<00:03:11.660> your

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
you want to think of is as your as your

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.050 
you want to think of is as your as your
metering<00:03:12.200> the<00:03:12.350> light<00:03:12.560> actually<00:03:13.040> i'll<00:03:13.190> share

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
metering the light actually i'll share

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.630 
metering the light actually i'll share
this<00:03:14.299> with<00:03:14.480> you<00:03:14.690> for<00:03:15.590> every<00:03:16.010> image<00:03:16.370> and<00:03:16.549> you'll

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
this with you for every image and you'll

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.170 
this with you for every image and you'll
see<00:03:16.880> it<00:03:17.000> later<00:03:17.030> I<00:03:17.600> focus<00:03:18.530> on<00:03:18.920> Susie's<00:03:19.610> left<00:03:20.000> I

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
see it later I focus on Susie's left I

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.420 
see it later I focus on Susie's left I
here<00:03:20.660> first<00:03:20.989> so<00:03:21.320> I<00:03:21.380> kept<00:03:21.739> everything<00:03:22.070> very

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
here first so I kept everything very

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.030 
here first so I kept everything very
consistent<00:03:23.120> as<00:03:23.269> for<00:03:24.019> the<00:03:24.049> lens<00:03:24.410> i'm<00:03:24.680> using<00:03:24.950> the

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
consistent as for the lens i'm using the

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.910 
consistent as for the lens i'm using the
same<00:03:25.310> lens<00:03:25.609> again<00:03:25.970> i'm<00:03:26.180> using<00:03:26.480> a<00:03:26.540> 24<00:03:27.079> to<00:03:27.200> 70<00:03:27.709> and

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
same lens again i'm using a 24 to 70 and

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.390 
same lens again i'm using a 24 to 70 and
i'm<00:03:28.640> using<00:03:29.030> it<00:03:29.150> at<00:03:29.329> 2.8<00:03:30.260> and<00:03:30.530> i've<00:03:30.829> maxed<00:03:31.130> it

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
i'm using it at 2.8 and i've maxed it

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.610 
i'm using it at 2.8 and i've maxed it
out<00:03:31.489> at<00:03:31.730> the<00:03:31.760> 70<00:03:32.329> millimeter<00:03:32.840> range<00:03:33.170> for<00:03:33.470> all

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
out at the 70 millimeter range for all

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.259 
out at the 70 millimeter range for all
three<00:03:34.010> of<00:03:34.040> them<00:03:34.250> so<00:03:34.489> that<00:03:34.519> everything<00:03:35.060> should

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
three of them so that everything should

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.319 
three of them so that everything should
be<00:03:35.600> identical<00:03:36.590> and<00:03:36.709> how<00:03:36.890> it's<00:03:37.100> handled<00:03:37.329> the

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:38.329 
be identical and how it's handled the

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:40.330 
be identical and how it's handled the
first<00:03:38.690> series<00:03:38.959> that<00:03:39.290> we<00:03:39.440> did<00:03:39.590> I<00:03:39.620> have<00:03:39.920> Susie

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
first series that we did I have Susie

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.340 
first series that we did I have Susie
actually<00:03:40.670> lie<00:03:40.850> down<00:03:40.910> on<00:03:41.239> the<00:03:41.269> couch<00:03:41.600> here<00:03:42.170> and

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
actually lie down on the couch here and

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.099 
actually lie down on the couch here and
so<00:03:43.130> the<00:03:43.280> light<00:03:43.519> is<00:03:43.549> actually<00:03:43.970> even<00:03:44.630> a<00:03:44.780> little

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:45.109 
so the light is actually even a little

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:48.250 
so the light is actually even a little
bit<00:03:45.290> you<00:03:45.890> know<00:03:45.920> darker<00:03:46.730> here<00:03:47.150> even<00:03:47.540> more<00:03:47.750> so<00:03:48.019> I

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
bit you know darker here even more so I

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.380 
bit you know darker here even more so I
shot<00:03:48.799> on<00:03:48.950> a<00:03:48.980> counter<00:03:49.489> distance<00:03:49.910> from<00:03:50.060> over

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
shot on a counter distance from over

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.920 
shot on a counter distance from over
there<00:03:50.540> so<00:03:50.780> if<00:03:50.900> I<00:03:51.049> neither<00:03:51.320> the<00:03:51.530> light<00:03:51.739> here

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
there so if I neither the light here

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.490 
there so if I neither the light here
what<00:03:53.930> I'm<00:03:54.049> getting<00:03:54.470> is<00:03:54.769> a<00:03:55.299> 2.8<00:03:56.299> at<00:03:56.510> six<00:03:57.019> the

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
what I'm getting is a 2.8 at six the

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.580 
what I'm getting is a 2.8 at six the
second<00:03:57.980> so<00:03:58.130> one<00:03:58.400> sixth<00:03:58.940> of<00:03:59.060> a<00:03:59.180> second<00:03:59.660> so

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
second so one sixth of a second so

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.830 
second so one sixth of a second so
that's<00:04:00.769> kind<00:04:01.040> of<00:04:01.130> how<00:04:01.579> the<00:04:01.640> whole<00:04:02.000> setup<00:04:02.299> has

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
that's kind of how the whole setup has

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.650 
that's kind of how the whole setup has
happened<00:04:03.799> tonight<00:04:04.040> so<00:04:04.150> later<00:04:05.150> on<00:04:05.239> i'll<00:04:05.510> be
