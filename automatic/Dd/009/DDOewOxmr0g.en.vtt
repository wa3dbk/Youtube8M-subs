00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
themes by default you're gonna have this

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.630 
themes by default you're gonna have this
look<00:01:43.829> and<00:01:44.039> one<00:01:44.990> one<00:01:45.990> thing<00:01:46.289> all<00:01:46.470> demo<00:01:46.890> here<00:01:47.549> in

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
look and one one thing all demo here in

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.149 
look and one one thing all demo here in
a<00:01:47.700> second<00:01:48.060> is<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.240> auto<00:01:48.420> open<00:01:48.689> feature<00:01:49.110> so<00:01:49.799> by

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
a second is the auto open feature so by

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.010 
a second is the auto open feature so by
default<00:01:50.340> they'll<00:01:50.700> be<00:01:50.850> closed<00:01:51.569> and<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:51.869> can

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
default they'll be closed and you can

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.559 
default they'll be closed and you can
click<00:01:52.259> on<00:01:52.380> them<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.560> open<00:01:52.679> and<00:01:53.159> actually<00:01:53.569> let's

00:01:54.559 --> 00:01:54.569 
click on them to open and actually let's

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:57.949 
click on them to open and actually let's
make<00:01:54.659> that<00:01:54.959> text<00:01:55.380> brighter<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:56.689> the<00:01:57.689> way<00:01:57.840> we

00:01:57.949 --> 00:01:57.959 
make that text brighter to the way we

00:01:57.959 --> 00:01:58.699 
make that text brighter to the way we
can<00:01:58.140> see<00:01:58.409> it

00:01:58.699 --> 00:01:58.709 
can see it

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:08.620 
can see it
I'll<00:01:59.099> change<00:01:59.429> the<00:02:00.830> change<00:02:01.830> the<00:02:01.920> text<00:02:02.640> color<00:02:02.939> to

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.180 

white<00:02:09.630> because<00:02:10.380> we<00:02:10.619> have<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.739> dark<00:02:11.009> background

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
white because we have a dark background

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.430 
white because we have a dark background
so<00:02:11.670> it<00:02:11.790> can't<00:02:12.120> see<00:02:12.269> it<00:02:12.360> too<00:02:12.540> well<00:02:12.569> here<00:02:13.200> in

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
so it can't see it too well here in

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.220 
so it can't see it too well here in
backend<00:02:14.130> but<00:02:14.790> when<00:02:14.940> we<00:02:15.120> actually<00:02:15.780> go<00:02:15.959> to<00:02:15.989> our

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
backend but when we actually go to our

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.660 
backend but when we actually go to our
template<00:02:16.799> it<00:02:17.190> comes<00:02:17.430> out<00:02:17.579> white<00:02:19.370> much<00:02:20.370> better

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
template it comes out white much better

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.620 
template it comes out white much better
for<00:02:20.940> a<00:02:20.970> dark<00:02:21.180> background<00:02:21.630> and<00:02:23.000> we'll<00:02:24.000> turn<00:02:24.329> the

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
for a dark background and we'll turn the

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:27.380 
for a dark background and we'll turn the
auto<00:02:24.810> open<00:02:25.140> feature<00:02:25.590> on<00:02:25.920> that<00:02:26.670> way<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.150> first

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
auto open feature on that way the first

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.050 
auto open feature on that way the first
tab<00:02:27.780> will<00:02:28.290> always<00:02:28.650> open<00:02:28.859> when<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.819> page<00:02:30.030> is

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
tab will always open when the page is

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.819 
tab will always open when the page is
first<00:02:30.239> loaded<00:02:32.060> and<00:02:33.060> let's<00:02:33.299> also<00:02:33.600> switch<00:02:34.560> to

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
first loaded and let's also switch to

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:36.500 
first loaded and let's also switch to
theme<00:02:35.040> too<00:02:35.340> so<00:02:35.850> I<00:02:35.880> can<00:02:36.090> show<00:02:36.239> you<00:02:36.299> the

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
theme too so I can show you the

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.750 
theme too so I can show you the
difference<00:02:36.989> between<00:02:37.200> these<00:02:37.560> you<00:02:38.220> know<00:02:38.340> one<00:02:38.639> of

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
difference between these you know one of

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.430 
difference between these you know one of
the<00:02:38.819> bigger<00:02:39.000> differences<00:02:39.480> though<00:02:39.690> is<00:02:39.959> this

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
the bigger differences though is this

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.410 
the bigger differences though is this
will<00:02:40.680> no<00:02:40.829> longer<00:02:41.069> have<00:02:41.310> that<00:02:41.420> transparent

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
will no longer have that transparent

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.990 
will no longer have that transparent
background<00:02:43.069> so<00:02:44.069> we'll<00:02:44.220> want<00:02:44.430> to<00:02:44.519> set<00:02:44.730> the

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
background so we'll want to set the

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.900

we'll turn it dark because the

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:54.069 
we'll turn it dark because the
background<00:02:51.540> is<00:02:51.750> gonna<00:02:51.930> be<00:02:52.019> white<00:02:52.350> you'll<00:02:53.340> see

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
here in a second there you go and as you

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.699 
here in a second there you go and as you
could<00:02:59.880> see<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.329> first<00:03:00.569> one<00:03:00.720> Auto<00:03:00.959> opened<00:03:01.530> and

could see the first one Auto opened and

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.430 
could see the first one Auto opened and
now<00:03:02.220> we<00:03:02.280> have<00:03:02.609> the<00:03:02.819> second<00:03:03.209> type<00:03:03.420> of<00:03:03.450> a<00:03:03.870> chord

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440
