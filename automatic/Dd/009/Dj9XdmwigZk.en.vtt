we<00:01:15.830> wait<00:01:16.009> until<00:01:16.430> the<00:01:16.850> motor<00:01:17.299> starts<00:01:17.750> foaming

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
we wait until the motor starts foaming

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.740 
we wait until the motor starts foaming
out<00:01:18.320> the<00:01:18.439> exhaust<00:01:18.680> once<00:01:19.640> the<00:01:19.850> engines<00:01:20.210> foaming

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
out the exhaust once the engines foaming

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.230 
out the exhaust once the engines foaming
out<00:01:20.869> the<00:01:21.020> exhaust<00:01:21.320> we<00:01:21.680> give<00:01:21.920> it<00:01:22.070> 30<00:01:22.640> seconds<00:01:23.090> on

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
out the exhaust we give it 30 seconds on

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.630 
out the exhaust we give it 30 seconds on
the<00:01:23.390> watch<00:01:23.570> and<00:01:23.960> this<00:01:24.619> long<00:01:24.920> enough<00:01:25.159> to<00:01:25.399> flush

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
the watch and this long enough to flush

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.249
