00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
 ay dynastar nik thank you sun and japan 

00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:08.610
 finally decided to innovate in something that 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.639
 does not have many incorporations in the 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.889
 recent years the wheelchair a 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.190
 device more than necessary and forgotten 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.830
 and invented a prototype a device 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.380
 who can have autonomy from his four 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.010
 wheels have tires as if 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.960
 will deal with a vehicle and in the chair 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.529
 wheels has sensors that can detect 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.020
 obstacles step sauces if it is 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.860
 necessary can climb stairs separates 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.290
 his artificial legs at nine o'clock and 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.320
 it can even narrow the surface of 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.780
 the wheels if the space is narrow and 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.170
 also raise and lower the chair according to 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.770
 need the user who is sitting in 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.770
 she to have complete stability 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.230
 the chivas technology institute 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.250
 Japan presented this prototype that 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.580
 still not in the sale 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.730
 but what they did communicate is that it was 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:09.280
 very well received by the community 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:12.990
 because that is a great improvement for 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.520
 the sector that could facilitate the 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.030
 mobility of many people with 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:22.060
 different disabilities the next 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.520
 trial phase will close with the 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.580
 incorporation into factories of this 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.290
 device but to come a little more 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.910
 near an argentina because we are 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.009
 talking about a Japanese invention that is a 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.350
 prototype I recommend them if they have 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.750
 some familiar friend or yourselves 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.690
 have any disabilities that enter 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:44.290
 in google the word wheelchair 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:46.780
 innovate innovate that is the contest of 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.460
 scientific and inventor developments 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.610
 of the Argentine Republic and they will see 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.979
 since 2007 there are different 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.920
 wheelchair prototypes that 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:59.080
 some won the prize to innovate others 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.330
 they did not win but they received mentions and 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.690
 contact teachers because 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.600
 surely they have carried out 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.820
 some nook of some province of the 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.600
 Argentine Republic thank you so much more 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.600
 work
