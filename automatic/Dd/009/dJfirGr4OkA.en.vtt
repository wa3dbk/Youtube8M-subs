00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.320 
chipped out most likely this takes a
huge<00:01:58.720> risk<00:01:59.220> what<00:02:00.220> she<00:02:00.310> tried<00:02:00.520> to<00:02:00.550> do<00:02:00.729> there<00:02:00.940> but

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
huge risk what she tried to do there but

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.060 
huge risk what she tried to do there but
didn't<00:02:01.930> work<00:02:02.080> out<00:02:02.229> that<00:02:04.800> mean<00:02:05.800> you<00:02:05.890> takes

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
didn't work out that mean you takes

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.399 
didn't work out that mean you takes
around<00:02:06.220> one

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:09.409 

00:02:09.409 --> 00:02:12.470 

yeah<00:02:10.409> Sanford<00:02:10.829> is<00:02:10.950> here<00:02:11.129> tonight<00:02:11.430> yep<00:02:12.090> he<00:02:12.390> has

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.190

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
rock-solid trying to get in there but I

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.000 
rock-solid trying to get in there but I
minish<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.709> wall<00:02:22.920> right<00:02:23.099> now<00:02:24.859> check<00:02:25.859> out<00:02:25.980> a

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
minish the wall right now check out a

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.530 
minish the wall right now check out a
distance<00:02:26.280> we've<00:02:26.430> got<00:02:26.609> a<00:02:26.640> minute<00:02:26.879> that's<00:02:27.359> been

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
distance we've got a minute that's been

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.929 
distance we've got a minute that's been
a<00:02:27.750> Tekkit<00:02:28.319> is<00:02:28.409> fun<00:02:28.560> that<00:02:29.010> minion<00:02:29.220> arm<00:02:29.549> holding

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:29.939 
a Tekkit is fun that minion arm holding

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:32.179 
a Tekkit is fun that minion arm holding
his<00:02:30.030> ground<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:31.049> right<00:02:31.200> range<00:02:31.409> on<00:02:31.620> screen<00:02:31.950> and

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:32.189 
his ground the right range on screen and

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:34.190 
his ground the right range on screen and
this<00:02:32.909> this<00:02:33.180> stage<00:02:33.390> is<00:02:33.569> really<00:02:33.810> good<00:02:33.989> for

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
this this stage is really good for

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.380 
this this stage is really good for
footsies<00:02:34.530> purposes<00:02:35.040> because<00:02:35.939> you<00:02:36.120> can<00:02:36.239> see

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
footsies purposes because you can see

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.849 
footsies purposes because you can see
the<00:02:36.510> corner<00:02:36.870> that's<00:02:37.170> why<00:02:37.319> you<00:02:37.379> can<00:02:37.530> also<00:02:37.680> see

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:37.859 
the corner that's why you can also see

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:39.589 
the corner that's why you can also see
the<00:02:37.980> center<00:02:38.340> of<00:02:38.370> this<00:02:38.700> of<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.150> stage<00:02:39.390> that

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
the center of this of the stage that

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.430 
the center of this of the stage that
behind<00:02:40.019> that's<00:02:40.260> where<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.560> middle<00:02:40.799> is<00:02:42.440> it

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
behind that's where the middle is it

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.809 
behind that's where the middle is it
also<00:02:43.650> has<00:02:43.799> least<00:02:44.010> amount<00:02:44.190> of<00:02:44.280> shit<00:02:44.430> going<00:02:44.700> on

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
also has least amount of shit going on

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:47.210 
also has least amount of shit going on
which<00:02:45.239> is<00:02:45.389> nothing<00:02:45.769> makes<00:02:46.769> ideal<00:02:47.069> for

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
which is nothing makes ideal for

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.100 
which is nothing makes ideal for
tournament<00:02:47.579> play

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.140 

so<00:02:52.800> keV<00:02:53.070> right<00:02:53.280> now<00:02:53.430> like<00:02:53.670> he's<00:02:53.700> doing<00:02:54.030> good

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
so keV right now like he's doing good

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.270 
so keV right now like he's doing good
but<00:02:54.330> his<00:02:54.450> ability<00:02:54.750> to<00:02:54.810> do<00:02:54.930> much<00:02:55.110> here<00:02:55.380> unless

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
but his ability to do much here unless

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.680 
but his ability to do much here unless
your<00:02:56.520> way<00:02:56.640> onto<00:02:56.850> the<00:02:57.000> burn<00:02:57.120> that<00:02:57.240> meter<00:02:57.480> maybe

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
your way onto the burn that meter maybe

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:58.940 
your way onto the burn that meter maybe
he<00:02:57.780> wants<00:02:57.960> to<00:02:57.990> keep<00:02:58.080> dolphins<00:02:58.470> going<00:02:58.740> push

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
he wants to keep dolphins going push

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.100 
he wants to keep dolphins going push
them<00:02:59.070> to<00:02:59.160> the<00:02:59.250> corner<00:02:59.550> either<00:03:00.480> way<00:03:00.690> Kevin's

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
them to the corner either way Kevin's

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.040 
them to the corner either way Kevin's
commanded<00:03:01.530> me<00:03:01.620> right<00:03:01.830> now<00:03:01.980> don't<00:03:02.430> solid<00:03:02.940> I<00:03:03.150> all

kev<00:03:16.560> i<00:03:16.920> don't<00:03:17.220> i<00:03:17.430> don't<00:03:17.460> think<00:03:18.030> that<00:03:18.120> solid<00:03:18.750> is

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
kev i don't i don't think that solid is

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.080 
kev i don't i don't think that solid is
gonna<00:03:19.170> be<00:03:19.410> Kevin<00:03:20.130> in<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.310> footsies<00:03:20.700> game<00:03:20.910> I

gonna be Kevin in the footsies game I

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.150 
gonna be Kevin in the footsies game I
think<00:03:21.330> that<00:03:21.480> you<00:03:21.780> really<00:03:21.959> should<00:03:22.709> step<00:03:22.920> up<00:03:23.040> his

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
think that you really should step up his

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.010 
think that you really should step up his
long-range<00:03:23.550> game<00:03:23.790> a<00:03:23.820> little<00:03:24.030> more<00:03:24.150> well<00:03:24.750> I

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
long-range game a little more well I

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.500 
long-range game a little more well I
mean<00:03:25.650> the<00:03:26.100> thing<00:03:26.580> is<00:03:26.610> God<00:03:26.910> can<00:03:27.090> actually<00:03:27.390> keep

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
mean the thing is God can actually keep

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.240 
mean the thing is God can actually keep
up<00:03:27.720> with<00:03:27.900> show<00:03:28.050> toes<00:03:28.230> and<00:03:28.410> a<00:03:28.440> fireball<00:03:28.860> war<00:03:29.100> so

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
up with show toes and a fireball war so

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.530 
up with show toes and a fireball war so
I<00:03:29.310> was<00:03:29.400> like<00:03:29.490> it's<00:03:29.640> hard<00:03:29.790> like<00:03:29.970> you<00:03:30.330> have<00:03:30.420> to

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
I was like it's hard like you have to

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.840 
I was like it's hard like you have to
combine<00:03:30.720> your<00:03:31.620> fireball<00:03:32.070> war<00:03:32.280> with<00:03:32.520> solid

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
combine your fireball war with solid

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.670 
combine your fireball war with solid
foot<00:03:33.030> seas<00:03:33.209> and<00:03:33.330> taking<00:03:33.630> risks<00:03:33.750> like<00:03:33.989> that<00:03:34.020> you

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
foot seas and taking risks like that you

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.050 
foot seas and taking risks like that you
can't<00:03:34.890> just<00:03:35.070> like<00:03:35.250> fireball<00:03:35.640> in<00:03:35.730> forever<00:03:35.880> it's

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
can't just like fireball in forever it's

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.810
