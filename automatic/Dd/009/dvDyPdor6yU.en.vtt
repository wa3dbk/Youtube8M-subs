00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
and we're just going to even the plant

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.959 
and we're just going to even the plant
up<00:00:57.739> using<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.980> pruners<00:00:59.370> which<00:00:59.579> we<00:00:59.760> always

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
up using the pruners which we always

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.420 
up using the pruners which we always
keep<00:01:00.329> clean<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.530> reason<00:01:01.920> we<00:01:02.010> keep<00:01:02.219> them

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
keep clean and the reason we keep them

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.039 
keep clean and the reason we keep them
clean<00:01:02.699> is<00:01:02.940> because<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.359> keeps<00:01:03.570> them<00:01:03.780> free<00:01:04.019> of

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
clean is because it keeps them free of

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.700
