00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:17.080
 great challenge was to get in front 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.090
 the cameras it was not to be 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.740
 compared to others who were they 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.509
 giants 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.179
 I stayed in my place 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:27.730
 say that of a skier curious about 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:29.349
 things of life and who is who has had 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.349
 this extraordinary opportunity of 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:34.720
 working with people from very 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:38.440
 great fame but also with 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:41.379
 outstanding historical actors that 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.770
 are for example my friend and vittorio of 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:43.780
 if it 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.149
 it was an opportunity that a young person 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.829
 man of 28 30 years old can not leave 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:49.780
 pass 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:54.510
 documentary bold tomorrow sheaths 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:58.350
 free visit my memory of vittorio 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:02.440
 is a very warm memory very 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.360
 fraternal he worked very hard and 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.990
 it was very difficult for him because of 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.510
 altitude mainly and and at 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.390
 after a few days it's me who 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.130
 helped him I helped him in his English 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.260
 because he did not speak English and 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.020
 so he was doing everything with tubes 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.210
 like that is to say that every scene he 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.430
 went back to a room like that and we 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.180
 had written his sentences by all he 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.370
 turned his head 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.830
 I helped him in the first session in 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:33.570
 English is so very fast we are 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:36.400
 become a couple of real friends 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.610
 For these reasons there but also because 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:44.500
 he was tired all day and the 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:46.750
 evening they told me go on the road and 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.240
 I used to be the driver with my 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.800
 beautiful blue porsche at the time and we 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.460
 let's both go down to the casino of 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:57.880
 Saint Vincent and that despite departing 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.830
 with the booty at the end we do not stay 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.560
 less extremely friendly because 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.420
 in the last scene victor humor 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.060
 still remains in my opinion 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.720
 extremely friendly characters and 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.360
 sometimes the thief even if the para 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:19.160
 Olympic 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:23.090
 or can be nice I made the year 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:25.220
 the set of stents because first 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.440
 in skiing it was difficult to find 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.910
 someone who is like me 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.300
 I was 28 years old 30 years old I do not know 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.080
 I was at the top of a mast and so that 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.480
 would have been difficult 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.180
 and then there are things that even at 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.459
 stuntman does not want to do for example 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:44.320
 when I enter this valley 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:47.600
 extraordinary inaccessible by a jump 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.820
 exceptional that was still 25 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.950
 meters and I could only do it one 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:56.150
 only once there was only me for the 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:58.790
 to do because it was necessary to h at the pace of 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.770
 jump land in the snow and continue 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.170
 of ski and I had a terrible shock 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.989
 and so I did not dare to do it a 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.120
 second time the mark it was skis 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:11.060
 american ed with whom I was under 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.730
 contract we burned several 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:17.840
 pairs of hate while filming but 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:19.519
 she the conditions of which was very 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.959
 difficult already naturally in this 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:21.380
 valley it was the top of a glacier 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.850
 still 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:28.280
 and it was skiing that seems difficult 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:32.350
 on the screen but that was extremely 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.350
 difficult extremely difficult 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:42.010
 what you see in the movie to my 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.210
 opinion represents a way of which 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.520
 is the 60s 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:48.550
 I do not think we can do better 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:51.310
 than that at that time because 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:57.160
 I had this passion for free skiing already 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:58.209
 of the eccentricity freeride already I have 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:01.560
 always what's like that 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:04.840
 differently from others and it represents 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.850
 for me twenty years work what whatever 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.420
 part that we find there in the film so 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.420
 it's not nothing
