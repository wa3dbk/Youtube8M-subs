is a KO max Seol ma ex model M 400 made

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.049 
is a KO max Seol ma ex model M 400 made
in<00:00:12.330> 1955<00:00:13.139> and<00:00:13.679> it's<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:14.460> background<00:00:14.700> music

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
in 1955 and it's the background music

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.500 
in 1955 and it's the background music
for<00:00:15.330> 45<00:00:16.020> rpm<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:16.949> as<00:00:17.730> you<00:00:17.850> can<00:00:17.970> see<00:00:18.029> here<00:00:18.420> on

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
for 45 rpm and as you can see here on

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.170 
for 45 rpm and as you can see here on
the<00:00:18.630> top<00:00:18.840> this<00:00:19.170> is<00:00:19.230> made<00:00:19.680> primarily<00:00:20.640> of<00:00:21.029> the

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
the top this is made primarily of the

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.960 
the top this is made primarily of the
aristocrat<00:00:21.960> mechanism<00:00:22.650> modified<00:00:23.550> highly

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
aristocrat mechanism modified highly

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.140 
aristocrat mechanism modified highly
obviously<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:25.170> has<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.380> rather<00:00:25.680> tall<00:00:26.550> spindle

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
obviously it has a rather tall spindle

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.060 
obviously it has a rather tall spindle
that<00:00:27.359> holds<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.750> 45s<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:28.529> I<00:00:28.590> don't<00:00:28.800> know<00:00:28.949> how

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
that holds the 45s and I don't know how

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.250 
that holds the 45s and I don't know how
many<00:00:29.130> it<00:00:29.400> holes<00:00:29.990> unfortunately<00:00:30.990> I<00:00:31.019> don't<00:00:31.109> have

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
many it holes unfortunately I don't have

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.900 
many it holes unfortunately I don't have
any<00:00:31.410> literature<00:00:31.980> on<00:00:32.099> that<00:00:32.130> outside<00:00:32.669> of<00:00:32.790> the

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
any literature on that outside of the

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.160 
any literature on that outside of the
service<00:00:33.090> manual<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:33.660> I<00:00:33.750> show<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:33.989> in<00:00:34.110> a

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
service manual that I show you in a

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.200 
service manual that I show you in a
second<00:00:34.590> but<00:00:34.710> it<00:00:35.100> gives<00:00:35.250> no<00:00:35.370> details<00:00:35.850> as<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.090> how

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
second but it gives no details as to how

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.720 
second but it gives no details as to how
many<00:00:36.329> it<00:00:36.570> holds<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.170> of<00:00:38.010> course<00:00:38.219> this<00:00:38.520> would

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
many it holds and of course this would

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.760 
many it holds and of course this would
be<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.030> weight<00:00:39.210> that<00:00:39.629> sits<00:00:39.960> on<00:00:40.079> those<00:00:40.320> records

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
be the weight that sits on those records

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.160 
be the weight that sits on those records
to<00:00:40.829> hold<00:00:41.100> them<00:00:41.250> down<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.820> there<00:00:42.600> are<00:00:42.809> three

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
to hold them down and there are three

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.380 
to hold them down and there are three
sheaves<00:00:43.770> they<00:00:44.280> are<00:00:44.430> circular<00:00:44.910> sheaves<00:00:45.210> I

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
sheaves they are circular sheaves I

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.389 
sheaves they are circular sheaves I
believe<00:00:45.719> that<00:00:45.899> drop<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.530> records<00:00:46.920> instead<00:00:47.190> of

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
believe that drop the records instead of

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.709 
believe that drop the records instead of
the<00:00:47.460> usual<00:00:47.610> two<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.239> would<00:00:48.390> normally

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
the usual two that you would normally

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.229 
the usual two that you would normally
see<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.620> of<00:00:49.770> course<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.190> feeling<00:00:50.579> arm<00:00:50.789> that

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
see and of course the feeling arm that

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.260 
see and of course the feeling arm that
is<00:00:51.809> typical<00:00:52.379> of<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.590> aristocrats<00:00:53.160> and<00:00:53.489> more

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
is typical of the aristocrats and more

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.270 
is typical of the aristocrats and more
unusual<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.899> plays<00:00:55.110> both<00:00:55.410> sides<00:00:55.739> we<00:00:56.070> have<00:00:56.250> a

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
unusual it plays both sides we have a

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.979 
unusual it plays both sides we have a
needle<00:00:56.550> on<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.850> top<00:00:57.090> and<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.390> needle<00:00:57.690> on<00:00:57.840> the

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
needle on the top and a needle on the

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.110 
needle on the top and a needle on the
bottom<00:00:58.350> as<00:00:58.530> well<00:00:59.100> as<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.340> brushes<00:00:59.850> that<00:00:59.969> would

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
bottom as well as the brushes that would

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.219 
bottom as well as the brushes that would
clean<00:01:00.390> them<00:01:00.510> so<00:01:01.260> it<00:01:01.590> has<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:02.329> kind<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.539> look<00:01:04.049> or

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
clean them so it has the kind of look or

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.100 
clean them so it has the kind of look or
feel<00:01:04.439> that<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.640> Seberg<00:01:06.150> background

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
feel that the the Seberg background

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.140 
feel that the the Seberg background
music<00:01:07.260> system<00:01:07.860> would<00:01:07.979> have<00:01:08.010> in<00:01:08.310> 16<00:01:08.700> hour<00:01:08.880> p.m.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
music system would have in 16 hour p.m.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.600 
music system would have in 16 hour p.m.
but<00:01:09.780> this<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:10.080> obviously<00:01:10.470> in<00:01:10.560> 45<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.340> has<00:01:11.460> an

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
but this is obviously in 45 it has an

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.179 
but this is obviously in 45 it has an
auto<00:01:11.760> switch<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:13.350> came<00:01:13.560> with<00:01:14.070> an

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
auto switch and it came with an

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.920 
auto switch and it came with an
amplifier<00:01:14.670> matching<00:01:15.150> amplifier<00:01:15.630> which<00:01:15.810> is

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
amplifier matching amplifier which is

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.990 
amplifier matching amplifier which is
not<00:01:16.170> here<00:01:16.590> all<00:01:16.770> he<00:01:16.890> got<00:01:17.040> was<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.310> basic<00:01:17.670> unit

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
not here all he got was the basic unit

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.240 
not here all he got was the basic unit
and<00:01:18.689> along<00:01:18.990> with<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.350> this<00:01:19.830> would<00:01:20.040> have<00:01:20.159> been

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
and along with that this would have been

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.929 
and along with that this would have been
tucked<00:01:20.610> inside<00:01:22.009> obviously<00:01:23.009> this<00:01:23.159> was<00:01:23.400> for<00:01:23.729> use

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
tucked inside obviously this was for use

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.460 
tucked inside obviously this was for use
with<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.210> amplifier<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:25.049> of<00:01:25.110> course<00:01:25.290> this

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
with the amplifier and of course this

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.289 
with the amplifier and of course this
gets<00:01:25.920> plugged<00:01:26.159> into<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.640> mechanism<00:01:27.150> inside

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
gets plugged into the mechanism inside

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.710 
gets plugged into the mechanism inside
here<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.280> we<00:01:29.280> also<00:01:29.490> have<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:29.880> manual<00:01:30.240> we<00:01:30.570> have<00:01:30.659> a

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
here and we also have a manual we have a

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.800 
here and we also have a manual we have a
service<00:01:31.079> manual<00:01:31.320> for<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.799> m400<00:01:32.549> it's<00:01:33.180> made<00:01:33.659> by

Cole<00:01:34.049> Mac's<00:01:34.259> as<00:01:34.439> I<00:01:34.560> said<00:01:34.829> out<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.520> Minnesota

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
Cole Mac's as I said out of Minnesota

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.999 
Cole Mac's as I said out of Minnesota
there's<00:01:36.930> very<00:01:37.079> little<00:01:37.259> information<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.890> be

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
there's very little information to be

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.679 
there's very little information to be
found<00:01:38.040> on<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.430> internet<00:01:38.880> this<00:01:39.299> ought<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.540> be<00:01:39.630> a

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
found on the internet this ought to be a

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.160 
found on the internet this ought to be a
very<00:01:39.780> interesting<00:01:40.259> project<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:42.570> bought

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
very interesting project and I bought

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.600 
very interesting project and I bought
this<00:01:43.380> with<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.770> hopes<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.159> having<00:01:44.310> this

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
this with the hopes of having this

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.520 
this with the hopes of having this
restored<00:01:45.090> sometime<00:01:45.869> in<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.110> future<00:01:46.229> I<00:01:46.439> just

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
restored sometime in the future I just
