to release it on consoles a tool which
is<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.649> bit<00:00:34.829> weird<00:00:34.860> but<00:00:35.280> i<00:00:35.340> suppose<00:00:35.520> at<00:00:35.850> the

is a bit weird but i suppose at the
other<00:00:36.120> day<00:00:36.300> maybe<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:36.989> majority<00:00:37.590> of<00:00:37.620> their

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
other day maybe a majority of their

audience is on the pc but it's 2499 on

any<00:01:36.540> way<00:01:36.750> whatsoever<00:01:36.900> well<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.950> i<00:01:38.579> think<00:01:38.790> in<00:01:38.850> my

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
any way whatsoever well it i think in my

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.390 
any way whatsoever well it i think in my
opinion<00:01:39.000> it's<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.479> quite<00:01:39.900> different<00:01:39.930> game<00:01:40.829> they

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
opinion it's a quite different game they

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.100 
opinion it's a quite different game they
didn't<00:01:41.640> really<00:01:41.820> give<00:01:42.090> anyone<00:01:42.299> until<00:01:42.659> early

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
didn't really give anyone until early

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.100 
didn't really give anyone until early
accessing<00:01:43.950> away<00:01:44.189> I<00:01:44.630> know<00:01:45.630> it's<00:01:45.750> called<00:01:45.930> early

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
accessing away I know it's called early

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.840 
accessing away I know it's called early
access<00:01:46.259> on<00:01:46.500> Steam<00:01:46.770> they<00:01:46.950> didn't<00:01:47.159> really<00:01:47.579> send

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
access on Steam they didn't really send

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.639 
access on Steam they didn't really send
out<00:01:48.000> any<00:01:48.180> youtubers<00:01:48.780> or<00:01:48.899> whatever<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.290> play

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
out any youtubers or whatever to play

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.080 
out any youtubers or whatever to play
the<00:01:49.829> game<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.040> couple<00:01:50.280> of<00:01:50.490> months<00:01:50.640> before<00:01:50.909> we

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
the game a couple of months before we

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.300 
the game a couple of months before we
got<00:01:51.180> early<00:01:51.600> access<00:01:51.750> on<00:01:51.930> Steam<00:01:52.320> so<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:52.979> don't

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
got early access on Steam so I don't

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.460 
got early access on Steam so I don't
think<00:01:53.549> it's<00:01:53.820> quite<00:01:54.060> like<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.360> think<00:01:54.750> doing

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
think it's quite like I think doing

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.560 
think it's quite like I think doing
early<00:01:55.740> action<00:01:55.860> steam<00:01:56.340> is<00:01:56.759> probably<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.420> lot

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
early action steam is probably a lot

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.999 
early action steam is probably a lot
better<00:01:57.719> than<00:01:58.020> just<00:01:58.170> sending<00:01:58.350> three<00:01:58.710> or<00:01:58.829> four

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
better than just sending three or four

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.590 
better than just sending three or four
people<00:01:59.189> out<00:01:59.520> to<00:01:59.729> play<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.090> game<00:02:00.270> because<00:02:00.479> you

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
people out to play the game because you

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.719 
people out to play the game because you
get<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.960> much<00:02:01.350> wider<00:02:01.740> audience<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:02.579> also

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
get a much wider audience and also

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.969 
get a much wider audience and also
people<00:02:03.090> that<00:02:03.329> pay<00:02:03.570> for<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.960> game<00:02:04.170> still<00:02:04.770> get

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
people that pay for the game still get

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.249 
people that pay for the game still get
more<00:02:05.159> honest<00:02:05.549> feedback<00:02:05.880> then<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:06.930> know<00:02:07.049> let's

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
more honest feedback then you know let's

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.109 
more honest feedback then you know let's
be<00:02:07.409> honest<00:02:07.649> if<00:02:07.799> I<00:02:07.950> win<00:02:08.160> and<00:02:08.250> test<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.640> gap<00:02:08.789> just

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
be honest if I win and test the gap just

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.240 
be honest if I win and test the gap just
be<00:02:09.300> really<00:02:09.629> excited<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.319> play<00:02:10.560> it<00:02:10.739> and<00:02:10.860> maybe

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
be really excited to play it and maybe

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.530 
be really excited to play it and maybe
not<00:02:11.489> give<00:02:11.670> actually<00:02:11.970> can<00:02:12.120> put<00:02:12.360> their

in<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:13.980> day<00:02:14.129> so<00:02:14.209> yeah<00:02:15.209> I<00:02:15.629> think<00:02:16.079> I<00:02:16.349> rambled<00:02:16.680> a

in the day so yeah I think I rambled a

in the day so yeah I think I rambled a
long<00:02:16.860> enough<00:02:17.069> about<00:02:17.280> that<00:02:17.519> but<00:02:17.760> anyway<00:02:18.060> this

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
long enough about that but anyway this

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.300 
long enough about that but anyway this
is<00:02:18.659> obviously<00:02:18.810> been<00:02:19.140> developed<00:02:19.590> by<00:02:19.739> the<00:02:19.799> dirt

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
is obviously been developed by the dirt

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.710 
is obviously been developed by the dirt
team<00:02:20.579> who<00:02:20.760> haven't<00:02:21.090> released<00:02:21.299> the<00:02:21.420> game<00:02:21.599> in

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
team who haven't released the game in

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.880 
team who haven't released the game in
quite<00:02:21.930> a<00:02:21.959> bit<00:02:22.079> of<00:02:22.140> time<00:02:22.200> I<00:02:22.379> think<00:02:22.680> dirt

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
quite a bit of time I think dirt

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.740 
quite a bit of time I think dirt
showdown<00:02:23.280> was<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:23.760> last<00:02:23.909> proper<00:02:24.390> game<00:02:24.569> they

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
showdown was the last proper game they

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.509 
showdown was the last proper game they
did<00:02:25.019> and<00:02:25.470> when<00:02:25.590> I<00:02:25.620> saw<00:02:25.890> this<00:02:26.040> game<00:02:26.280> I<00:02:26.310> thought

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
did and when I saw this game I thought

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.160 
did and when I saw this game I thought
is<00:02:26.670> this<00:02:26.790> just<00:02:27.000> another<00:02:27.090> android<00:02:27.930> game

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
is this just another android game

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.660 
is this just another android game
whatever<00:02:28.379> I<00:02:28.620> didn't<00:02:28.799> really<00:02:28.890> read<00:02:29.159> into<00:02:29.189> it<00:02:29.549> a

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
whatever I didn't really read into it a

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.610 
whatever I didn't really read into it a
huge<00:02:29.879> amount<00:02:30.090> when<00:02:30.209> I<00:02:30.239> first<00:02:30.450> saw<00:02:30.720> it<00:02:30.750> so<00:02:31.409> the

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
huge amount when I first saw it so the

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.289 
huge amount when I first saw it so the
android<00:02:32.099> port<00:02:32.370> of<00:02:32.579> one<00:02:32.700> of<00:02:32.790> their<00:02:32.879> games<00:02:33.120> a

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
android port of one of their games a

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.690 
android port of one of their games a
couple<00:02:33.480> of<00:02:33.750> months<00:02:33.959> ago<00:02:34.049> whatever<00:02:34.439> and<00:02:34.799> if<00:02:35.609> I

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
couple of months ago whatever and if I

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.059 
couple of months ago whatever and if I
quad<00:02:36.060> be<00:02:36.180> a<00:02:36.209> criticism<00:02:36.659> but<00:02:37.230> any<00:02:37.799> other<00:02:37.890> day

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
quad be a criticism but any other day

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.069 
quad be a criticism but any other day
that<00:02:39.000> doesn't<00:02:39.269> really<00:02:39.299> matter<00:02:39.510> because<00:02:39.750> we're

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
that doesn't really matter because we're

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:42.410 
that doesn't really matter because we're
here<00:02:40.260> with<00:02:40.470> a<00:02:40.500> really<00:02:40.950> proper<00:02:41.459> dirt<00:02:41.819> game<00:02:42.180> now

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
here with a really proper dirt game now

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.080 
here with a really proper dirt game now
the<00:02:42.959> physics<00:02:43.409> are<00:02:43.650> much<00:02:44.069> improved<00:02:44.280> over<00:02:44.849> what

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
the physics are much improved over what

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.869 
the physics are much improved over what
we<00:02:45.209> had<00:02:45.390> with<00:02:45.629> dirt<00:02:45.870> 1<00:02:46.139> 2<00:02:46.440> and<00:02:46.650> 3<00:02:46.709> I<00:02:47.220> didn't<00:02:47.730> play

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
we had with dirt 1 2 and 3 I didn't play

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:49.460 
we had with dirt 1 2 and 3 I didn't play
showdown<00:02:48.450> but<00:02:48.659> I'm<00:02:48.750> assuming<00:02:49.109> it's<00:02:49.170> pretty

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
showdown but I'm assuming it's pretty

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.949 
showdown but I'm assuming it's pretty
similar<00:02:49.739> to<00:02:49.889> that<00:02:50.129> quite<00:02:50.430> Arkady<00:02:51.209> physics<00:02:51.780> and

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
similar to that quite Arkady physics and

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.479 
similar to that quite Arkady physics and
everything<00:02:52.319> and<00:02:52.500> this<00:02:52.980> has<00:02:53.190> gone<00:02:53.370> a<00:02:53.400> little

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
everything and this has gone a little

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.720 
everything and this has gone a little
bit<00:02:53.879> more<00:02:54.000> realistic<00:02:54.450> a<00:02:54.810> bit<00:02:54.989> like<00:02:55.170> what<00:02:55.730> 322

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
bit more realistic a bit like what 322

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.460 
bit more realistic a bit like what 322
grid<00:02:56.940> Autosport<00:02:57.090> was<00:02:57.720> like<00:02:57.870> so<00:02:58.019> i<00:02:58.049> suppose<00:02:58.230> i

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
grid Autosport was like so i suppose i

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.679 
grid Autosport was like so i suppose i
can<00:02:58.530> see<00:02:58.769> that<00:02:58.799> comparison<00:02:59.579> there<00:02:59.760> it<00:03:00.359> got<00:03:00.659> a

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:00.689 
can see that comparison there it got a

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:02.149 
can see that comparison there it got a
bit<00:03:00.840> more<00:03:01.019> realistic<00:03:01.349> isn't<00:03:02.040> like<00:03:02.129> a

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 
bit more realistic isn't like a

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:04.640 
bit more realistic isn't like a

that<00:03:06.959> but<00:03:07.230> it's<00:03:07.439> more<00:03:07.680> sore<00:03:07.980> middle<00:03:08.400> ground<00:03:08.700> so

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:08.939 
that but it's more sore middle ground so

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:11.660 
that but it's more sore middle ground so
it<00:03:08.970> has<00:03:09.379> you<00:03:10.379> know<00:03:10.500> better<00:03:10.769> tendency<00:03:11.430> with<00:03:11.579> the

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
it has you know better tendency with the

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:12.890 
it has you know better tendency with the
wheel<00:03:11.849> and<00:03:11.970> everything<00:03:12.090> you<00:03:12.420> can<00:03:12.569> use<00:03:12.750> the

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
wheel and everything you can use the

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.020 
wheel and everything you can use the
wheel<00:03:13.049> a<00:03:13.079> lot<00:03:13.260> better<00:03:13.500> I<00:03:13.909> haven't<00:03:14.909> actually

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
wheel a lot better I haven't actually

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.520 
wheel a lot better I haven't actually
played<00:03:15.209> with<00:03:15.420> the<00:03:15.480> control<00:03:15.810> of<00:03:15.840> my<00:03:16.019> friend<00:03:16.349> did

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
played with the control of my friend did

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.589 
played with the control of my friend did
but<00:03:16.739> said<00:03:17.010> it's<00:03:17.549> much<00:03:17.790> better<00:03:18.030> with<00:03:18.299> the<00:03:18.389> wheel

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
but said it's much better with the wheel

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:20.720 
but said it's much better with the wheel
than<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:19.019> controller<00:03:19.440> so<00:03:19.769> if<00:03:20.010> you<00:03:20.310> have<00:03:20.519> that

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
than the controller so if you have that

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.460 
than the controller so if you have that
decision<00:03:21.239> debate<00:03:21.510> definitely<00:03:22.109> go<00:03:22.290> of<00:03:22.349> the

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
decision debate definitely go of the

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:23.569 
decision debate definitely go of the
wheel<00:03:22.620> that's<00:03:22.829> the<00:03:23.010> one<00:03:23.099> you're<00:03:23.220> looking<00:03:23.250> at

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
wheel that's the one you're looking at

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.520 
wheel that's the one you're looking at
at<00:03:23.639> the<00:03:23.669> moment<00:03:23.760> to<00:03:24.030> be<00:03:24.120> better<00:03:24.329> and<00:03:24.720> yeah<00:03:25.410> I've

until I made that mistake there but

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.750 
until I made that mistake there but
luckily<00:03:52.019> with<00:03:52.739> the<00:03:52.829> modern<00:03:53.099> day<00:03:53.129> rally<00:03:53.459> cars

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
luckily with the modern day rally cars

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.729 
luckily with the modern day rally cars
you<00:03:53.940> can<00:03:54.030> get<00:03:54.209> them<00:03:54.389> into<00:03:55.049> reverse<00:03:55.349> and<00:03:55.379> then

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
you can get them into reverse and then

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.619 
you can get them into reverse and then
so<00:03:56.220> switched<00:03:56.549> around<00:03:56.760> and<00:03:57.120> back<00:03:57.239> into<00:03:57.510> first

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:57.629 
so switched around and back into first

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:59.839 
so switched around and back into first
gear<00:03:57.959> quite<00:03:58.530> quickly<00:03:58.799> with<00:03:59.129> the<00:03:59.159> slower<00:03:59.519> cars

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
gear quite quickly with the slower cars

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:01.430 
gear quite quickly with the slower cars
it's<00:04:00.060> quite<00:04:00.269> tough<00:04:00.510> and<00:04:00.750> make<00:04:01.260> another

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
it's quite tough and make another

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.740 
it's quite tough and make another
mistake<00:04:01.680> here<00:04:02.250> lies<00:04:02.519> or<00:04:02.729> keep<00:04:03.359> trying<00:04:03.599> to<00:04:03.659> get

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
mistake here lies or keep trying to get

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.360 
mistake here lies or keep trying to get
back<00:04:03.870> onto<00:04:04.079> the<00:04:04.260> road<00:04:04.379> without<00:04:04.560> resetting<00:04:05.069> and

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
back onto the road without resetting and

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.189 
back onto the road without resetting and
I<00:04:05.430> make<00:04:05.579> very<00:04:05.940> small<00:04:06.209> mistakes<00:04:06.750> and<00:04:06.959> another

I make very small mistakes and another
one<00:04:07.379> there<00:04:07.620> but<00:04:08.220> it's<00:04:08.729> it's<00:04:09.150> more<00:04:09.329> realistic

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:09.629 
one there but it's it's more realistic

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:11.780 
one there but it's it's more realistic
it's<00:04:10.109> more<00:04:10.290> challenging<00:04:10.620> than<00:04:11.099> the<00:04:11.250> previous
