00:00:09.979 --> 00:00:11.789
 in fact for the moment 

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:13.039
 to register 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:15.089
 property rights 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.089
 which by definition 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.130
 items when 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.029
 individual plan 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:24.079
 housing 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:27.079
 anna today is 90 the third federal law 

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:30.329
 on the simplified procedure for registration of rights to 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:32.169
 individual properties under 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:33.730
 one of the objects 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.410
 because this is the action of which 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:37.000
 falls 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.090
 this law is a knife back 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.660
 Enough to set on 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.050
 technical 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.760
 technical inventory form 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.590
 make a cadastral passport 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.230
 this is the only one 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.160
 document necessary for 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.860
 registration rights 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:55.860
 the main condition is only 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.060
 availability of land rights 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.510
 that is, it can be either right 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.770
 ownership or leasehold 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.720
 list of registration rights 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.290
 make a cadastral passport 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.640
 on land 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.570
 and then everything and the whole country 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:09.300
 rub object of individual 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.870
 housing 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.100
 other documents period 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:14.659
 if today to legislators 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.020
 stipulated by law so let's say 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.720
 necessary and less for 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.980
 in order to 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.120
 simplify registration of rights to 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.070
 bread 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.560
 but I still want to hit another moment 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.940
 specify 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:29.760
 up to the object of the individual 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.510
 housing this 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:32.810
 residential buildings designed to 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.440
 single-family residence 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.920
 all the same no more than 3 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.340
 that is, if 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.100
 the object does not fall under these parameters 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.680
 accordingly he is not subject to him 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.580
 registration simplified order 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.150
 need to look at each specific situation 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.130
 that is, if violated now 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.470
 it is of course too 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.460
 preparing a full package of documents from 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.890
 permissions that is design 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.039
 documentation 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:58.439
 which are solved even grows only there 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.750
 also required 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.320
 will introduce if permission to enter in 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.760
 operation before commission 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.610
 representatives of all 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.150

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.710
 locked at home 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.640
 not subject 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.869
 2 yes here is a significant difference this year 

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:14.089
