00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.109
 Y 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.430
 all right 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.120
 two 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.559
 Y 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.559
 i 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.730
 i 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:43.140
 Y 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.880
 because nobody is going to tear me down even though 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.850
 I always tried to stay true to myself 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:55.030
 and so it will be 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.339
 a smiling child a delinquent child a 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.379
 child who does not live alone waits for death 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:01.449
 to think that I want to see you dream if it is 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.760
 depressing suffering flying falling crying 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:05.890
 while I wake up, life is hard not 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.780
 will show the years the damage will make you 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.700
 strong will not be more than a stranger the 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.070
 memories of yesteryear will not be more than 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.830
 past and the future will not make sense without 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:17.560
 she by your side that everything costs and that's why 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.289
 it is respected to go up the slope to express oneself in 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.869
 the book perfect nights early morning 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:25.420
 shit rhymes select here nobody will do 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:27.490
 I lose fighting for my dreams I do not 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.340
 they are going to prevent me from being a soul in pain 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.679
 and I snuffed the elixir to exist 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.289
 endure rain dripping on my roof and 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:37.270
 My mind is already cloudy, they want to knock me down 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:40.119
 but I 'm already lying not so good 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.250
 as they think, nor is it so bad, I am a 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.110
 slave one more warrior in war that 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.539
 rudderless boat and a sphere that is 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.179
 eternal thought about his legs I'm 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:52.209
 finished dicte my lyrics that I went 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:55.179
 criticized I went up in a hurry and the fall is 

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:57.100
 lasts a heart with 100 stitches 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:59.920
 I have smiles but I 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.080
 this mute alive without hurry this reality 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.119
 which is raw I still have doubts until the 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.690
 end of my days subject to these chains 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:10.000
 created melancholy and I can not no more no 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.190
 I can be here I exile in my bubble 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.739
 where I always wanted to flee I got up and 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.989
 thus emerge without the phoenix of 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:19.000
 Ashes always knew how to give of itself and now 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.040
 I'm just lost here in my room 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.220
 loudmouths are nothing because of that 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.350
 I'm still tired of your moves 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.170
 I do not think about liking you, I'm just looking for my 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.780
 out I swallowed saliva to fight the 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.780
 blows keep silence so as not to be other 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.910
 clumsy heal cuts and also wounds 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.220
 I kept the carriage walking between 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.560
 avenues suicidal soul that is already 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.140
 recovered always turns on a light 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.810
 when the other one goes out these looks 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.920
 the rap that I feel one day made me strong 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.010
 and that's why I tell you 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.010
 to 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.560
 ah 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.909
 ah 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.390
 with closed eyes I imagine your smile 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.390
 and that you're here by my fingers 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:22.090
 bound your tangled hair by grabbing me and 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.550
 telling me that I was lying yawning 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.650
 I stay and thank you for it I give 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.010
 thanks to fate for enforcing my 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.010
 dream
