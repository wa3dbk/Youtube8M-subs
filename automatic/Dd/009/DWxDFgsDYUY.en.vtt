00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.440
 and 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.180
 he is a regular in exile after a few 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:18.430
 one of the boarders jean-franÃ§ois com 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:21.520
 or root the extension of a 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:24.160
 gorgeous viable and a new range 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.320
 the people who inherited your 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.619
 technology hulot me I'm good 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.560
 happy testing its treatment 60 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.370
 evolution case in this under the range 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.040
 very very upscale 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:39.310
 exactly it's really a blend 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:42.190
 philippe enters new skies hero track 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:45.340
 performance and new skies everything 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.170
 field that we experiment we do not mix 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:51.040
 a bit of both technologies to make 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.660
 real off-road skiing but 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.030
 specifically little more for the track 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:58.120
 very easy to ski and especially 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.500
 new rays because that 's for 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.140
 the ones we had lasted a little longer 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.390
 long means long radius for 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.689
 Quebec Ontario may be a little 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.430
 less appropriate now we're talking about 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:12.640
 same types of spokes as our skis 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:16.060
 slalom not only for sizes 170 cm 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:19.090
 at the 14th of May really exciting what 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:27.250
 is also easy to ski and very 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:30.840
 powerful at the same time the 108 106 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.760
 selections are going to be very simple seduced 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.040
 dimension lines very similar one to 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.400
 the other one we will play with the 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.870
 constructions in the isthmus then the 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.200
 continues since 5 and for our heart 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.830
 prior to its core expert wood 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.280
 metal sheets 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.799
 ok the pursuit 700 wood core a 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.690
 sheet of metal no longer two fails 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:53.950
 points for spirals looking a little 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.840
 more versatility that buy from 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.930
 less powerful also muscular or 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.940
 for the lighter we think we 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.530
 the cff should be neutral who 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.590
 will join them the greatest number of 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.799
 people in intermediate esquire has 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.100
 Explain 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.320
 and the 6 1 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.870
 who at my turn stall it's this 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.980
 that he has used fidh basalt at 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.780
 nightingale which is well known since 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.520
 several years that replaces a little the 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.980
 carbon fiber with a very light ski 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.960
 easy to ski it comes mostly very 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.000
 round below so rising what 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.340
 is skiers maybe a little bit more 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.010
 aged or alley who do not want 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.210
 necessarily an extreme ski and more 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.770
 what is known as power 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.930
 equals the times a little more than 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.130
 tired early in the day you know 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.080
 when they say they very powerful 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.330
 sometimes rendered at 12:02 people who 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:45.080
 say they are going really easy to nose 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:45.080
 what is this technology 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:55.200
 a percentage of at least 10 to 20% all 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.050
 dependent models of what he 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.320
 suited well looked for I'm wrong or 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:04.350
 800 is not far 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.790
 that's why they're going to be scorned 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:09.870
 also the pursuit yes that does not make 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.580
 metal like the tei level $ 1,000 to 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.320
 price level makes that two months 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.420
 all inclusive but then I went down 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.640
 10 and 20 for that as soon as I have that 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.470
 in the range the range that taheri after 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.360
 we quickly go back to the experiments 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:26.010
 what changes experience by 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:27.720
 example on the 84 and questionable skiing this 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.850
 are exactly doing everything that is 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.600
 currently there is only one port in 2015 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.580
 16 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.950
 philippe lys that will be delivered to 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:38.670
 same price with a hiatus to his excellent 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:41.010
 3rd it is common stock inflation at 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.860
 two tribes of several years the 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:45.840
 level of bindings that's what 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:50.910
 it's because the mind needs 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:54.150
 more forces is an axial right like 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.410
 this here a better push forward 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.480
 offer a better 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.710
 report at the level of a bomb a 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.900
 better rebound control 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:05.780
 skiing will be more efficient with its 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:12.390
 fixations would be they will engage 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:23.280
 know it when you're always sure I'm 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:25.290
 allows to go a lot of levels of 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.960
 novelties of the real beasts of track 3 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:30.840
 pen here you can really adjust 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.720
 the flex very precisely the real shows 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.890
 skip my mill and especially in the 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:40.590
 speed3 different widths 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:42.450
 philippe 2% minimum of feet plus 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.180
 small to narrow at the foot - 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:48.930
 exactly and that's really cool at 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.970
 speed 102 mm wide and learn 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.220
 of flex and it's the same type of 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:55.500
 plastic boxes will not cause the 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.060
 diane boats ok there it's really 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.070
 exciting ego who have good skiers 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.720
 heavy enough h and then that they want 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.120
 a lot of hope at the toes 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:06.600
 or finally sends one probably 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:12.120
 money 130 200 time already that's 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:16.620
 beefy thing to the hundred in the blood 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:21.330
 of flex the same complete ranges are 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:23.100
 all also with more traits 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:32.810
 performing very hot also at the level of 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:32.810
 continuity
