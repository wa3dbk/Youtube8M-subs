00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
when we're playing this experiment when

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.100 
when we're playing this experiment when
a<00:00:42.600> friend<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.079> poke<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:44.270> think<00:00:45.270> accepting

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
a friend of a poke I think accepting

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.400

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
Middlesbrough but I think the thing that
