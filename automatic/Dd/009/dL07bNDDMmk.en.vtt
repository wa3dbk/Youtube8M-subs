00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.210
 older greater eat iron is also 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.439
 good because it gives you iron for 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.029
 bones is that what the rubber did not have 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.890

 both half rooms turned the wall 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.150
 effectively they give and effectively if you go 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.630
 at a speed of 300 kilometers 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.430

 obviously ends up eating now that is 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.880
 something quite normal in life is worth 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.880

 It was really going to be a bit 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.690
 complicated first but I'm going to 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.640

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.430
 I was shocked and I stay within 3 megs and 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.260
 This is worth staying on the last lap 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.810
 10 control points I go fourth and I want 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.430

 Of course, if everything is true, it is 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.420
 I have a very big delay, uncle is that 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.940

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.080
 normal let's lose 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:18.280
 but this does something epic and when 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.099
 determined the smoke gets low know that 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.360
 it's pathetic 25 seconds for ene efe not 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:24.040
 Well, this is happening 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.310

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.310
