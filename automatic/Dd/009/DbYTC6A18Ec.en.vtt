00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
to just apply a little bit of pressure

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.610

super<00:03:02.360> tight<00:03:02.570> because<00:03:02.930> the<00:03:03.020> thread<00:03:03.230> will

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
super tight because the thread will

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.470 
super tight because the thread will
actually<00:03:03.650> cut<00:03:03.860> through<00:03:04.010> the<00:03:04.100> material<00:03:04.610> and

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
bottom this time the first time I went

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.620 
bottom this time the first time I went
over<00:03:28.160> the<00:03:28.250> top<00:03:28.280> the<00:03:29.000> second<00:03:29.269> time<00:03:29.360> I'm<00:03:29.450> gonna

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
over the top the second time I'm gonna

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.509 
over the top the second time I'm gonna
go<00:03:29.810> from<00:03:30.260> the<00:03:30.350> bottom<00:03:30.680> and<00:03:30.769> what<00:03:30.890> that<00:03:31.040> does<00:03:31.250> is

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
go from the bottom and what that does is

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.240 
go from the bottom and what that does is
it<00:03:31.730> it<00:03:32.390> really<00:03:32.570> makes<00:03:33.410> a<00:03:33.530> pinch<00:03:33.769> point<00:03:34.040> for<00:03:34.190> the

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
it it really makes a pinch point for the

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.440 
it it really makes a pinch point for the
two<00:03:34.400> knots<00:03:34.610> warrens<00:03:35.060> kind<00:03:35.209> of<00:03:35.269> pulling

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
two knots warrens kind of pulling

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.320 
two knots warrens kind of pulling
against<00:03:35.810> the<00:03:35.870> other<00:03:36.760> pull<00:03:37.760> that<00:03:37.910> tight<00:03:38.180> as

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
against the other pull that tight as

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.800 
against the other pull that tight as
well<00:03:39.940> simply<00:03:40.940> cut<00:03:41.180> the<00:03:41.269> remainder<00:03:41.630> of<00:03:41.660> your

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
well simply cut the remainder of your

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.750 
well simply cut the remainder of your
thread<00:03:42.049> off<00:03:42.260> and<00:03:42.560> then<00:03:43.100> before<00:03:43.220> I<00:03:43.400> take<00:03:43.670> the

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
thread off and then before I take the

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.580 
thread off and then before I take the
jig<00:03:43.970> out<00:03:44.090> of<00:03:44.180> the<00:03:44.239> vise<00:03:44.450> I<00:03:44.690> like<00:03:44.900> to<00:03:45.019> cut<00:03:45.200> my<00:03:45.230> jig

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
jig out of the vise I like to cut my jig

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.060 
jig out of the vise I like to cut my jig
skirts<00:03:46.420> in<00:03:47.420> the<00:03:47.690> vise<00:03:47.900> and<00:03:48.200> the<00:03:48.620> reason<00:03:48.890> for

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
skirts in the vise and the reason for

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.530 
skirts in the vise and the reason for
that<00:03:49.130> is<00:03:49.370> because<00:03:49.519> I<00:03:49.730> don't<00:03:49.820> want<00:03:49.970> mine<00:03:50.239> to<00:03:50.420> be

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
that is because I don't want mine to be

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:51.970 
that is because I don't want mine to be
just<00:03:50.750> straight<00:03:50.870> across<00:03:51.140> the<00:03:51.410> end<00:03:51.650> all<00:03:51.860> I'm

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
just straight across the end all I'm

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.680 
just straight across the end all I'm
doing<00:03:52.250> is<00:03:52.340> just<00:03:52.519> basically<00:03:52.760> removing<00:03:53.150> the

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
doing is just basically removing the

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.770 
doing is just basically removing the
very<00:03:53.959> the<00:03:54.290> very<00:03:54.320> ends<00:03:54.860> of<00:03:54.920> each<00:03:55.070> tab<00:03:55.780> where

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
very the very ends of each tab where

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.060 
very the very ends of each tab where
they're<00:03:56.900> solid<00:03:57.380> just<00:03:57.560> freeing<00:03:57.890> up<00:03:58.040> the

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
they're solid just freeing up the

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:00.220 
they're solid just freeing up the
material<00:03:58.640> and<00:03:59.390> then<00:03:59.510> once<00:03:59.660> you<00:03:59.750> take<00:03:59.780> the<00:04:00.019> jig

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
material and then once you take the jig

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.680 
material and then once you take the jig
out<00:04:00.350> of<00:04:00.470> your<00:04:00.590> vise<00:04:00.769> you<00:04:01.220> can<00:04:01.370> see<00:04:01.610> that<00:04:01.880> it

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
out of your vise you can see that it

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.750 
out of your vise you can see that it
doesn't<00:04:02.900> hang<00:04:03.230> just<00:04:03.680> dead<00:04:03.890> level<00:04:04.280> as<00:04:04.430> it<00:04:04.579> would

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
doesn't hang just dead level as it would

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.240 
doesn't hang just dead level as it would
is<00:04:04.910> if<00:04:05.180> you<00:04:05.360> cut<00:04:05.570> it<00:04:05.600> straight<00:04:05.900> across<00:04:06.019> I<00:04:06.739> like

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
is if you cut it straight across I like

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.069 
is if you cut it straight across I like
the<00:04:07.489> fact<00:04:07.730> that<00:04:07.880> the<00:04:08.060> skirt<00:04:08.329> has<00:04:08.600> some

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:09.079 
the fact that the skirt has some

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:10.509 
the fact that the skirt has some
different<00:04:09.410> lengths<00:04:09.769> to<00:04:09.890> it<00:04:09.980> I<00:04:10.040> think<00:04:10.250> it<00:04:10.340> looks

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
different lengths to it I think it looks

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:11.740 
different lengths to it I think it looks
more<00:04:10.700> natural<00:04:10.910> and<00:04:11.209> it<00:04:11.299> gives<00:04:11.420> it<00:04:11.510> a<00:04:11.570> more

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
more natural and it gives it a more

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:12.220 
more natural and it gives it a more
knock

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
knock

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.380 
knock

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:17.120 
people think it is and it's very

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.180
