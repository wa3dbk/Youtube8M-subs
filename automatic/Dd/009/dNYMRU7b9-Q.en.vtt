00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.080 

next<00:04:31.510> pushy<00:04:32.220> that's<00:04:33.220> pretty<00:04:33.400> cool<00:04:33.520> so<00:04:33.970> these

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
are like $12 a piece but they come with

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.770 
are like $12 a piece but they come with
an<00:04:36.460> item<00:04:36.670> last<00:04:36.910> year<00:04:37.180> these<00:04:37.330> items<00:04:37.630> were

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
an item last year these items were

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.170 
an item last year these items were
exclusive<00:04:38.290> to<00:04:38.320> TI<00:04:38.650> basically<00:04:39.190> um<00:04:39.820> so<00:04:40.090> I<00:04:40.150> think

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
exclusive to TI basically um so I think

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.640 
exclusive to TI basically um so I think
they're<00:04:40.420> worth<00:04:40.510> a<00:04:40.570> lot<00:04:40.600> less<00:04:40.720> now<00:04:41.020> this<00:04:41.470> year

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
they're worth a lot less now this year

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.140 
they're worth a lot less now this year
but<00:04:42.070> because<00:04:42.460> they<00:04:42.550> just<00:04:42.700> released<00:04:43.030> these

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
but because they just released these

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.670 
but because they just released these
today<00:04:43.450> I<00:04:43.480> thought<00:04:43.720> they<00:04:43.840> were<00:04:43.900> gonna<00:04:44.020> be<00:04:44.110> TI

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
today I thought they were gonna be TI

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.170 
today I thought they were gonna be TI
