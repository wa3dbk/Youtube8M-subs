whiteboard<00:00:05.549> Wednesday<00:00:06.240> here<00:00:06.480> today<00:00:06.720> our

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
whiteboard Wednesday here today our

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.440 
whiteboard Wednesday here today our
topic<00:00:07.770> that<00:00:08.460> we'd<00:00:08.580> like<00:00:08.700> to<00:00:08.760> discuss<00:00:08.940> is

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
topic that we'd like to discuss is

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.410 
topic that we'd like to discuss is
monetizing<00:00:10.410> your<00:00:10.440> apps<00:00:10.710> and<00:00:11.639> there's<00:00:11.790> broadly

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
monetizing your apps and there's broadly

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.450 
monetizing your apps and there's broadly
two<00:00:12.630> key<00:00:12.870> segments<00:00:13.259> we<00:00:13.349> want<00:00:13.530> to<00:00:13.590> cover<00:00:13.799> so<00:00:14.130> the

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
two key segments we want to cover so the

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.820 
two key segments we want to cover so the
first<00:00:14.700> is<00:00:14.969> how<00:00:15.299> to<00:00:15.330> monetize<00:00:15.809> your<00:00:16.320> apps

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
first is how to monetize your apps

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.040 
first is how to monetize your apps
directly<00:00:17.279> within<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.940> app<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.330> then<00:00:18.779> we<00:00:18.900> also

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
directly within the app and then we also

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.349 
directly within the app and then we also
want<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.350> cover<00:00:19.590> very<00:00:19.980> briefly<00:00:20.039> how<00:00:21.029> you<00:00:21.090> can

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
want to cover very briefly how you can

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.300 
want to cover very briefly how you can
combine<00:00:21.570> your<00:00:21.779> apps<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.560> work<00:00:22.890> in<00:00:23.010> conjunction

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
combine your apps to work in conjunction

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.950 
combine your apps to work in conjunction
with<00:00:23.519> your<00:00:23.820> traditional<00:00:24.180> offline<00:00:24.449> channels

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
with your traditional offline channels

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.609 
with your traditional offline channels
in<00:00:25.109> store<00:00:25.500> or<00:00:25.769> other<00:00:26.400> channels<00:00:26.730> so<00:00:27.720> let's<00:00:27.900> jump

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
in store or other channels so let's jump

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.550 
in store or other channels so let's jump
right<00:00:28.710> into<00:00:28.949> it<00:00:29.070> so<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.699> first<00:00:30.029> point<00:00:30.990> around

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
right into it so the first point around

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.490 
right into it so the first point around
in<00:00:31.890> app<00:00:32.239> monetization<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:34.079> traditional

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
in app monetization is the traditional

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.130 
in app monetization is the traditional
paid<00:00:34.710> download<00:00:35.100> model<00:00:35.510> very<00:00:36.510> frequently<00:00:36.989> used

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
paid download model very frequently used

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.970 
paid download model very frequently used
in<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.320> early<00:00:37.559> days<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.219> app<00:00:38.370> stores

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
in the early days of the app stores

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.220 
in the early days of the app stores
typically<00:00:40.980> if<00:00:41.820> you<00:00:41.969> go<00:00:42.000> back<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.629> $0.99

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
typically if you go back to the $0.99

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.350 
typically if you go back to the $0.99
app<00:00:43.440> still<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.800> lot<00:00:43.920> of<00:00:44.010> them<00:00:44.100> out<00:00:44.190> there<00:00:44.520> it's

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
app still a lot of them out there it's

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.770 
app still a lot of them out there it's
becoming<00:00:45.690> increasingly<00:00:45.899> more<00:00:46.530> difficult<00:00:46.590> to

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
becoming increasingly more difficult to

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.600 
becoming increasingly more difficult to
help<00:00:48.780> drive<00:00:49.140> people<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.770> download<00:00:50.309> your<00:00:50.430> apps

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
help drive people to download your apps

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.180 
help drive people to download your apps
because<00:00:51.090> with<00:00:51.750> over<00:00:52.020> 800,000<00:00:52.710> apps<00:00:52.860> in<00:00:53.100> the

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
because with over 800,000 apps in the

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.369 
because with over 800,000 apps in the
App<00:00:53.280> Store<00:00:53.550> now<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.850> on<00:00:53.969> Apple<00:00:54.329> alone<00:00:54.600> it's

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
App Store now and on Apple alone it's

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.410 
App Store now and on Apple alone it's
very<00:00:55.770> hard<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.280> get<00:00:56.460> people's<00:00:56.760> attention<00:00:56.879> and

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
very hard to get people's attention and

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.750 
very hard to get people's attention and
putting<00:00:57.629> up<00:00:57.780> another<00:00:57.840> hurdle<00:00:58.500> of<00:00:58.710> having<00:00:59.430> to

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
putting up another hurdle of having to

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.599 
putting up another hurdle of having to
jump<00:00:59.940> through<00:01:00.030> a<00:01:00.210> paid<00:01:00.719> app<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.920> hard<00:01:02.489> and

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
jump through a paid app is hard and

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.219 
jump through a paid app is hard and
harder<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:02.850> harder<00:01:03.149> so<00:01:03.390> that's<00:01:03.899> only

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
harder and harder so that's only

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.160 
harder and harder so that's only
representing<00:01:04.710> roughly<00:01:05.070> 24<00:01:05.790> percent<00:01:06.299> of<00:01:06.479> the

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
representing roughly 24 percent of the

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.020 
representing roughly 24 percent of the
revenue<00:01:07.590> in<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:08.040> iPhone<00:01:08.460> store<00:01:08.610> today

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
revenue in the iPhone store today

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.450 
revenue in the iPhone store today
there's<00:01:10.020> also<00:01:10.260> some<00:01:10.590> statistics<00:01:11.250> out<00:01:11.430> there

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
there's also some statistics out there

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.179 
there's also some statistics out there
that<00:01:11.850> talked<00:01:12.060> about<00:01:12.350> the<00:01:13.350> fact<00:01:13.560> that<00:01:13.710> actually

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
that talked about the fact that actually

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.780 
that talked about the fact that actually
four<00:01:14.490> out<00:01:14.700> of<00:01:14.729> five<00:01:15.290> paid<00:01:16.290> Android<00:01:17.040> apps<00:01:17.340> are

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
four out of five paid Android apps are

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.060 
four out of five paid Android apps are
downloaded<00:01:18.180> less<00:01:18.750> than<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:18.990> hundred<00:01:19.259> times<00:01:19.439> so

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
downloaded less than a hundred times so

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.999 
downloaded less than a hundred times so
clearly<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.880> paid<00:01:21.360> app<00:01:21.570> is<00:01:21.900> finding<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.619> harder

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
clearly a paid app is finding it harder

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.370 
clearly a paid app is finding it harder
and<00:01:23.070> harder<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.369> get<00:01:23.790> traction<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:24.900> because<00:01:25.259> of

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
and harder to get traction so because of

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.719 
and harder to get traction so because of
that<00:01:25.500> we're<00:01:25.710> seeing<00:01:25.920> increasingly<00:01:26.520> other

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
that we're seeing increasingly other

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.670 
that we're seeing increasingly other
models<00:01:27.119> becoming<00:01:27.600> more<00:01:27.720> prominent<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.409> first

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
models becoming more prominent the first

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.359 
models becoming more prominent the first
is<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.670> in-app<00:01:30.090> advertising<00:01:30.420> model<00:01:31.170> so<00:01:31.680> that

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
is the in-app advertising model so that

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.719 
is the in-app advertising model so that
by<00:01:32.790> itself<00:01:33.210> today<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:33.930> roughly<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.409> 7.3<00:01:35.189> billion

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
by itself today is roughly a 7.3 billion

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.679 
by itself today is roughly a 7.3 billion
dollar<00:01:36.000> industry<00:01:37.430> you've<00:01:38.430> seen<00:01:38.670> very<00:01:39.270> often

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
dollar industry you've seen very often

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.109 
dollar industry you've seen very often
the<00:01:40.020> traditional<00:01:40.470> ad<00:01:40.650> networks<00:01:41.130> play<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:41.939> big

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
the traditional ad networks play a big

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.580 
the traditional ad networks play a big
role<00:01:42.329> in<00:01:42.360> this<00:01:42.600> but<00:01:42.810> what's<00:01:43.110> happening<00:01:43.500> in

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
role in this but what's happening in

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.170 
role in this but what's happening in
more<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:43.799> more<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.220> is<00:01:44.399> that<00:01:44.880> actual

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
more and more so is that actual

more and more so is that actual
publishers<00:01:45.689> are<00:01:45.869> coming<00:01:46.110> into<00:01:46.259> this<00:01:46.409> space<00:01:46.560> so

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
publishers are coming into this space so

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.069 
publishers are coming into this space so
a<00:01:47.490> company<00:01:47.909> like<00:01:48.030> Facebook<00:01:48.270> which<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.930> few

a company like Facebook which a few

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.580 
a company like Facebook which a few
years<00:01:49.110> ago<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:50.340> actually<00:01:50.670> no<00:01:51.590> advertising

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
years ago and actually no advertising

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.609 
years ago and actually no advertising
revenue<00:01:53.009> today<00:01:53.310> is<00:01:53.820> driving<00:01:54.540> roughly<00:01:55.200> three

examples let's say you play a game and
you<00:02:22.860> might<00:02:23.040> want<00:02:23.340> to<00:02:23.430> accelerate<00:02:23.730> your<00:02:24.209> your

up a playing level faster what we're
also<00:02:33.989> seeing<00:02:34.290> is<00:02:34.470> a<00:02:34.500> fair<00:02:34.680> amount<00:02:34.829> of<00:02:34.860> extra

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
also seeing is a fair amount of extra

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.800 
also seeing is a fair amount of extra
expenditure<00:02:35.549> related<00:02:36.120> to<00:02:36.269> ecommerce

directly<00:02:37.620> happening<00:02:38.159> in<00:02:38.489> an<00:02:38.730> app<00:02:38.909> so<00:02:39.180> take

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
directly happening in an app so take

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.420 
directly happening in an app so take
even<00:02:39.750> as<00:02:39.840> an<00:02:39.959> example<00:02:40.230> they<00:02:40.890> are<00:02:41.010> now<00:02:41.129> driving

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
even as an example they are now driving

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.880 
even as an example they are now driving
12<00:02:41.940> billion<00:02:42.629> dollars<00:02:43.079> every<00:02:43.230> single<00:02:43.769> year

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
12 billion dollars every single year

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.800 
12 billion dollars every single year
directly<00:02:44.280> through<00:02:44.610> through<00:02:44.970> mobile<00:02:45.150> so<00:02:45.780> a

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
directly through through mobile so a

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.729 
directly through through mobile so a
huge<00:02:46.170> industry<00:02:46.440> and<00:02:46.859> a<00:02:47.190> big<00:02:47.940> area<00:02:48.269> of<00:02:48.359> growth

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
huge industry and a big area of growth

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.860 
huge industry and a big area of growth
so<00:02:49.739> that's<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.220> in<00:02:50.430> app<00:02:50.670> monetization<00:02:51.390> let's

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
so that's the in app monetization let's

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.990 
so that's the in app monetization let's
take<00:02:52.049> a<00:02:52.079> look<00:02:52.319> at<00:02:52.500> the<00:02:52.799> out<00:02:53.519> of<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:53.879> app

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
take a look at the out of the app

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.059 
take a look at the out of the app
monetization<00:02:54.450> so<00:02:55.349> if<00:02:55.680> you<00:02:55.829> take<00:02:56.010> a

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
monetization so if you take a

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.940 
monetization so if you take a
traditional<00:02:57.109> brick-and-mortar<00:02:58.109> store<00:02:58.739> as<00:02:58.829> an

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
traditional brick-and-mortar store as an

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.819 
traditional brick-and-mortar store as an
example<00:02:59.569> having<00:03:00.569> an<00:03:00.690> app<00:03:00.900> allows<00:03:01.409> you<00:03:01.620> really

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
example having an app allows you really

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:04.759 
example having an app allows you really
to<00:03:01.950> optimize<00:03:02.609> and<00:03:03.090> combine<00:03:03.870> a<00:03:04.349> rich

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
to optimize and combine a rich

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.309 
to optimize and combine a rich
experience<00:03:04.950> that<00:03:05.790> helps<00:03:06.569> you<00:03:06.720> drive<00:03:06.959> more

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
experience that helps you drive more

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.380 
experience that helps you drive more
revenue<00:03:07.739> in<00:03:08.010> store<00:03:08.549> and<00:03:08.849> it<00:03:08.940> allows<00:03:09.180> you<00:03:09.299> to

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
revenue in store and it allows you to

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.300 
revenue in store and it allows you to
combine<00:03:09.569> for<00:03:10.049> example<00:03:10.379> your<00:03:10.530> loyalty<00:03:10.890> program

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
combine for example your loyalty program

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.360 
combine for example your loyalty program
and<00:03:11.579> drive<00:03:11.760> purchases<00:03:12.329> directly<00:03:13.190> from<00:03:14.190> the

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
and drive purchases directly from the

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.119 
and drive purchases directly from the
app<00:03:14.489> into<00:03:14.879> the<00:03:14.970> store<00:03:15.209> and<00:03:15.329> vice<00:03:15.480> versa<00:03:16.129> the

app into the store and vice versa the

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:18.860 
app into the store and vice versa the
other<00:03:17.340> example<00:03:17.819> I<00:03:17.849> find<00:03:18.090> fascinating<00:03:18.359> is

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
other example I find fascinating is

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.559 
other example I find fascinating is
Rovio<00:03:19.440> the<00:03:19.829> make<00:03:20.010> of<00:03:20.190> Angry<00:03:20.609> Birds<00:03:20.819> so<00:03:21.359> they're

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 
Rovio the make of Angry Birds so they're

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:22.909 
Rovio the make of Angry Birds so they're
actually<00:03:21.870> leveraging<00:03:22.260> all<00:03:22.410> of<00:03:22.739> these

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:22.919 
actually leveraging all of these

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:25.520 
actually leveraging all of these
different<00:03:23.280> vehicles<00:03:23.669> combined<00:03:24.150> they<00:03:24.870> have<00:03:24.900> a

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
different vehicles combined they have a

different vehicles combined they have a
paid<00:03:26.010> model<00:03:26.250> they<00:03:26.669> have<00:03:26.700> parts<00:03:27.690> of<00:03:27.810> their

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
paid model they have parts of their

versions around Angry Birds actually a

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.659 
versions around Angry Birds actually a
paid<00:03:29.609> paid<00:03:30.590> game<00:03:31.590> they<00:03:32.190> are<00:03:32.220> doing

but<00:03:39.389> what<00:03:39.660> I<00:03:39.690> found<00:03:39.900> really<00:03:40.049> fascinating<00:03:40.919> is

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
but what I found really fascinating is

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.789 
but what I found really fascinating is
that<00:03:41.599> 45%<00:03:42.599> of<00:03:42.750> the<00:03:43.139> revenue<00:03:43.500> today<00:03:43.620> is

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
that 45% of the revenue today is

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:46.189 
that 45% of the revenue today is
actually<00:03:44.250> coming<00:03:44.459> from<00:03:44.579> plush<00:03:45.569> toys<00:03:45.900> from

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:46.199 
actually coming from plush toys from

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:48.680 
actually coming from plush toys from
licensing<00:03:46.769> from<00:03:47.010> t-shirts<00:03:47.459> I<00:03:47.819> think<00:03:48.449> about<00:03:48.569> it

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
licensing from t-shirts I think about it

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.150 
licensing from t-shirts I think about it
almost<00:03:48.900> half<00:03:49.139> the<00:03:49.349> revenue<00:03:49.500> is<00:03:49.709> coming<00:03:49.919> from

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
almost half the revenue is coming from

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.430 
almost half the revenue is coming from
non<00:03:50.430> app<00:03:50.790> related<00:03:51.239> revenues<00:03:51.660> so<00:03:52.199> if<00:03:52.290> you're
