drawing cars I thought that was

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.290 
drawing cars I thought that was
something<00:02:10.739> that<00:02:11.009> was<00:02:11.129> you<00:02:11.459> know<00:02:11.610> kind<00:02:12.090> of<00:02:12.150> like

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
something that was you know kind of like

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
kind of got it back into the footwear

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.170 
kind of got it back into the footwear
and<00:02:16.260> I<00:02:16.410> and<00:02:16.650> you<00:02:17.129> know<00:02:17.220> had<00:02:17.670> some<00:02:17.700> internships

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.059 
and I and you know had some internships
with<00:02:18.629> different<00:02:18.870> brands<00:02:19.080> you<00:02:19.680> know<00:02:19.709> and

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
with different brands you know and

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:21.860 
with different brands you know and
through<00:02:20.430> college<00:02:20.790> you<00:02:21.000> know<00:02:21.450> when<00:02:21.660> you<00:02:21.750> go

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
through college you know when you go

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.449 
through college you know when you go
into<00:02:22.049> schools<00:02:22.440> sometimes<00:02:22.650> you<00:02:22.890> just<00:02:22.950> look<00:02:23.220> to

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
into schools sometimes you just look to

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.369 
into schools sometimes you just look to
design<00:02:23.730> that<00:02:23.879> final<00:02:24.239> product<00:02:24.480> and<00:02:24.840> I<00:02:25.349> think

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
design that final product and I think

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.289 
design that final product and I think
it's<00:02:25.650> important<00:02:26.129> like<00:02:26.310> to<00:02:26.519> develop<00:02:26.849> some<00:02:27.209> of

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
it's important like to develop some of

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:30.050 
it's important like to develop some of
those<00:02:27.420> tools<00:02:28.200> in<00:02:28.620> your<00:02:28.739> toolbox<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.489> kind<00:02:29.970> of

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
those tools in your toolbox to kind of

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.520 
those tools in your toolbox to kind of
help<00:02:30.209> you<00:02:30.360> along<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.750> way<00:02:30.989> you<00:02:31.049> know<00:02:31.260> whether

help you along the way you know whether

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.680 
help you along the way you know whether
it's<00:02:31.709> like<00:02:31.980> some<00:02:32.129> engineering<00:02:32.580> 3d<00:02:33.000> cads<00:02:33.269> and

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
it's like some engineering 3d cads and

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.020 
it's like some engineering 3d cads and
it<00:02:34.019> really<00:02:34.290> gives<00:02:34.530> you<00:02:34.650> a<00:02:34.680> great<00:02:35.220> skill<00:02:35.760> set

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
it really gives you a great skill set

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.390 
it really gives you a great skill set
and<00:02:36.180> let<00:02:36.480> you<00:02:36.660> kind<00:02:36.840> of<00:02:37.019> understand<00:02:37.680> you<00:02:38.310> know

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
and let you kind of understand you know

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.069 
and let you kind of understand you know
how<00:02:38.730> design<00:02:39.510> kind<00:02:39.690> of<00:02:39.810> comes<00:02:39.959> together

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
how design kind of comes together

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:43.370 
how design kind of comes together
proportion<00:02:40.980> composition<00:02:41.900> you<00:02:42.900> know<00:02:43.019> looking

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
proportion composition you know looking

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.650 
proportion composition you know looking
at<00:02:43.560> you<00:02:43.620> know<00:02:43.920> things<00:02:44.370> that<00:02:44.519> people<00:02:44.670> wear<00:02:45.060> to

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
designing a shoe to bring some new

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.879 
designing a shoe to bring some new
wealth<00:04:53.520> and<00:04:53.699> new<00:04:53.760> elements<00:04:54.180> or<00:04:54.240> details<00:04:54.889> the

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:55.889 
wealth and new elements or details the

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:56.900 
wealth and new elements or details the
one<00:04:56.070> thing<00:04:56.220> I<00:04:56.310> think<00:04:56.490> that's<00:04:56.610> really

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
one thing I think that's really

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:58.760 
one thing I think that's really
important<00:04:57.360> is<00:04:57.479> also<00:04:57.660> finding<00:04:58.590> something

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
important is also finding something

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:00.560 
important is also finding something
familiar<00:04:59.400> you<00:04:59.699> know<00:04:59.820> because<00:05:00.090> it's<00:05:00.210> easy<00:05:00.419> to

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
familiar you know because it's easy to

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.870 
familiar you know because it's easy to
design<00:05:00.810> a<00:05:00.990> spaceship<00:05:01.590> that<00:05:02.010> you<00:05:02.400> know<00:05:02.520> can

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
design a spaceship that you know can

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.330 
design a spaceship that you know can
take<00:05:03.570> you<00:05:03.750> to<00:05:03.960> you<00:05:04.740> know<00:05:04.800> really<00:05:05.130> futuristic

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
take you to you know really futuristic

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.070 
take you to you know really futuristic
place<00:05:05.970> but<00:05:06.240> I<00:05:06.270> think<00:05:06.360> you<00:05:06.630> have<00:05:06.720> to<00:05:06.840> kind<00:05:07.020> of

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:07.080 
place but I think you have to kind of

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.020 
place but I think you have to kind of
balance<00:05:07.440> that<00:05:07.500> modern<00:05:08.099> craft<00:05:08.370> or<00:05:08.669> that<00:05:08.820> modern

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
balance that modern craft or that modern

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.600 
balance that modern craft or that modern
aesthetic<00:05:09.889> what's<00:05:10.889> something<00:05:11.099> that's<00:05:11.280> a

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
aesthetic what's something that's a

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.070 
aesthetic what's something that's a
little<00:05:11.760> bit<00:05:11.940> more<00:05:12.090> familiar<00:05:12.270> and<00:05:12.720> it<00:05:12.810> makes

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:13.080 
little bit more familiar and it makes

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.170 
little bit more familiar and it makes
you<00:05:13.169> want<00:05:13.380> to<00:05:13.440> wear<00:05:13.590> it<00:05:13.770> I<00:05:14.280> think<00:05:14.699> the<00:05:14.789> one<00:05:14.940> most

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
you want to wear it I think the one most

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.420 
you want to wear it I think the one most
important<00:05:15.630> thing<00:05:15.660> I<00:05:15.810> would<00:05:15.960> say<00:05:16.349> would<00:05:16.590> be<00:05:16.770> is

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:17.430 
important thing I would say would be is

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.029 
important thing I would say would be is
that<00:05:17.639> shoes<00:05:17.970> are<00:05:18.630> necessary<00:05:19.349> always<00:05:19.530> works<00:05:19.860> of

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:20.039 
that shoes are necessary always works of

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:21.890 
that shoes are necessary always works of
art<00:05:20.250> but<00:05:20.520> there's<00:05:20.760> things<00:05:21.150> that<00:05:21.270> are<00:05:21.389> they're

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
art but there's things that are they're

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.930 
art but there's things that are they're
actually<00:05:22.169> made<00:05:22.320> to<00:05:22.440> be<00:05:22.560> worn<00:05:22.590> so<00:05:23.159> you<00:05:23.699> got<00:05:23.849> to

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
actually made to be worn so you got to

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.100 
actually made to be worn so you got to
take<00:05:24.060> that<00:05:24.240> into<00:05:24.479> account<00:05:24.570> and<00:05:24.870> so<00:05:24.990> I<00:05:25.050> think

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
take that into account and so I think

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.810 
take that into account and so I think
fashion<00:05:25.650> trend<00:05:25.919> and<00:05:26.130> style<00:05:26.340> play<00:05:26.580> a<00:05:26.610> big

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
fashion trend and style play a big

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.310 
fashion trend and style play a big
factor<00:05:27.360> in<00:05:27.389> the<00:05:27.539> way<00:05:27.630> we<00:05:27.840> kind<00:05:28.020> of<00:05:28.080> create

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 
factor in the way we kind of create
