this<00:00:02.460> is<00:00:02.790> a<00:00:02.820> new<00:00:03.210> mammal<00:00:03.750> Marine<00:00:04.319> Engine<00:00:05.029> it's

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
this is a new mammal Marine Engine it's

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.360 
this is a new mammal Marine Engine it's
a<00:00:06.529> twin<00:00:07.529> cylinder<00:00:08.719> double-acting

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:10.370 
a twin cylinder double-acting

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.380 
a twin cylinder double-acting
oscillating<00:00:11.370> engine

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:14.390 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.750 

it's<00:00:14.960> made<00:00:15.230> of<00:00:15.470> stainless<00:00:15.980> steel<00:00:16.190> and<00:00:16.550> brass

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:16.760 
it's made of stainless steel and brass

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.100 
it's made of stainless steel and brass
and<00:00:18.910> it's<00:00:19.910> got<00:00:20.390> a<00:00:20.420> forward<00:00:20.869> and<00:00:21.020> reverse

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:21.110 
and it's got a forward and reverse

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:27.580 
and it's got a forward and reverse
mechanism<00:00:24.490> also<00:00:25.490> attached<00:00:25.880> is<00:00:26.210> a<00:00:26.720> inline

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
mechanism also attached is a inline

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:40.910 
mechanism also attached is a inline
lubricator<00:00:29.590> it's<00:00:30.590> self-starting

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:47.360 

and<00:00:41.100> so<00:00:41.550> reversing<00:00:45.380> the<00:00:46.380> food<00:00:46.740> and<00:00:47.070> reverse

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
and so reversing the food and reverse

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.170 
and so reversing the food and reverse
lever<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:48.180> easily<00:00:49.110> be<00:00:49.260> attached<00:00:49.740> to<00:00:50.010> a<00:00:50.400> servo

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
lever and easily be attached to a servo

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.720 
lever and easily be attached to a servo
system

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.780 

we<00:00:58.240> have<00:00:58.360> submitted<00:00:58.660> this<00:00:59.110> to<00:00:59.170> a<00:00:59.550> engine<00:01:00.550> and

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:00.790 
we have submitted this to a engine and

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.320 
we have submitted this to a engine and
boat<00:01:01.210> builder<00:01:01.810> and<00:01:02.200> he<00:01:02.580> has<00:01:03.580> given<00:01:03.790> this<00:01:04.090> a

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
boat builder and he has given this a

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.660 
boat builder and he has given this a
report<00:01:04.780> to<00:01:05.050> say<00:01:05.260> that<00:01:05.500> it<00:01:05.650> will<00:01:05.770> run<00:01:06.040> for<00:01:06.460> an

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 
report to say that it will run for an

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:24.100 
report to say that it will run for an
excess<00:01:07.090> of<00:01:07.420> 20<00:01:08.320> minutes

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.620 

we<00:01:24.680> have<00:01:24.890> also<00:01:25.100> developed<00:01:27.700> two<00:01:28.700> slide<00:01:29.390> valve

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
we have also developed two slide valve

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.730 
we have also developed two slide valve
engines

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:41.840 

one<00:01:34.310> with<00:01:34.820> gears<00:01:35.350> and<00:01:36.350> one<00:01:36.770> without

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.170 

these<00:01:42.510> are<00:01:42.869> only<00:01:43.439> prototypes<00:01:44.400> at<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.759> moment

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
these are only prototypes at the moment

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.539 
these are only prototypes at the moment
and<00:01:45.360> we<00:01:45.600> are<00:01:45.630> anticipating<00:01:46.409> releasing<00:01:47.369> them

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
and we are anticipating releasing them

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:54.530 
and we are anticipating releasing them
shortly<00:01:48.740> the<00:01:49.740> oscillator<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:51.420> available<00:01:52.140> now
