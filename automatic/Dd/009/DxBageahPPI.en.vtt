00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 hello our dear readers and 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.109
 today we continue to debunk the myths 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.490
 about chinese cars 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:09.679
 especially for this we arrived today 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.980
 to the dealer network 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:15.690
 car lifan kites then and 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:19.140
 sales specialist albert will help 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.939
 we find out why people are not so nice 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.480
 Chinese cars that they most often 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.720
 they say 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.640
 tell Alberta for what reasons 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.400
 people now refuse to buy 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.930
 chinese cars 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:35.160
 hello but mostly people 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.460
 argue that they have metal 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.600
 weak plastic they smell foul 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.670
 that there are problems with spare parts and 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:48.539
 In the end, it's just that they are difficult. 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.789
 sell then and here's how really but 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.039
 if we say here to take the metal because 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.920
 we all remember we will not call brands 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.079
 when the car laughed against the wall and that's what 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.260
 Now what is happening, look at 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.180
 materials this metals machine goes 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.510
 Russian assembly, she is going to have us 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.909
 Russia and despite the fact that we have everything 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.740
 Now she is going to Russia material 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.159
 all cars he Russian 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.200
 metallurgists of the same material they 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.220
 no different from other cars 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.220
 not inferior 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.820
 If here on crash tests look like u 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.950
 them there and what's up, but for now 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:31.750
 look at the bodice well, for example 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:34.180
 evidence 64 he passed the crash test it goes 4 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.130
 and on for this car it is very 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.990
 even good here even he is chinese 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.410
 production 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:44.020
 I wonder here are the parts how to be about 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:48.310
 parts at the moment for parts 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:52.360
 problems we dealers on all warehouses 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:54.970
 presence is what they are 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.960
 Machines assembled in Russia and spare parts 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:03.940
 what problems bring special problems 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:05.920
 especially not clear well here again 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.600
 back to the plastic of the cabin but because 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.410
 before we really had complaints 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.570
 I remember it right now 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.380
 right now how but with this moment I 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.850
 agree with you was the camera moment when 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:23.290
 the Chinese car market came in on that 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:25.120
 our market tried that time 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.010
 unpleasant odors plastic was some 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.410
 weird this moment right now it's 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.239
 the problem is completely solved in the country on and 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.709
 in the data of the car is no longer 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.530
 this smell and plastic is much 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:38.110
 it's nice that the Chinese are working on their 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.570
 errors they analyze the constant 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.540
 that with plastic, we are fine 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:45.269
 well, we will try to see it 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.290
 it really is really 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.510
 analyze several sources and 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.989
 what we got you can read 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.989
 farther
