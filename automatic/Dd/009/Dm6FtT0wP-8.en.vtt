and<00:05:29.830> in<00:05:29.920> all<00:05:30.070> likelihood<00:05:30.250> I<00:05:31.170> was<00:05:32.170> a<00:05:32.200> fool

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:46.389 

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:50.490 

so<00:05:47.219> that's<00:05:48.219> everything<00:05:49.050> what<00:05:50.050> you<00:05:50.169> would<00:05:50.319> call

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:50.500 
so that's everything what you would call

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:56.520 
so that's everything what you would call
a<00:05:52.259> tragedy<00:05:53.259> from<00:05:53.620> the<00:05:53.770> human<00:05:54.039> perspective<00:05:55.530> but

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:56.530 
a tragedy from the human perspective but

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:59.700 
a tragedy from the human perspective but
maybe<00:05:57.460> the<00:05:57.610> human<00:05:57.879> perspective<00:05:58.120> is<00:05:58.590> limited<00:05:59.590> I

00:05:59.700 --> 00:05:59.710 
maybe the human perspective is limited I

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:05.250 
maybe the human perspective is limited I
don't<00:05:59.740> know<00:06:00.870> it's<00:06:01.870> coming<00:06:02.770> downtown
