00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
I think if the scar maybe 12 of them

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.979 
I think if the scar maybe 12 of them
then<00:00:41.070> you<00:00:41.760> know<00:00:41.850> we<00:00:42.239> probably<00:00:42.420> don't<00:00:42.629> go<00:00:42.809> over

disappointing but no we were real soft I
me<00:02:46.720> worse<00:02:46.930> after<00:02:47.230> you<00:02:47.349> know<00:02:47.500> you're<00:02:47.950> going<00:02:48.040> to

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
many as we did in such a short period of

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
many as we did in such a short period of
