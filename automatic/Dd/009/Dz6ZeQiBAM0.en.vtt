00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:07.198
72 hours ago, a secret weapon system code-named GoldenEye was detonated over Severnaya.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.559
A radiation surge that destroys everything with an electronic circuit.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:19.200
If you think for one moment I don't have the balls to send a man out to die, your instincts are dead wrong.
I've no compunction about sending you to your death.

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.699
I want you to find GoldenEye, find who took it, what they plan to do with it, and stop it.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.600
Bond.

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:31.790
Come back alive.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.019
Ready to save the world again? 
For England, Alec.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.299
He used the chopper to steal a nuclear weapon.

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.239
Killed a lot of innocent Russians doing it.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:51.139
What else do we know about the Janus Syndicate? 
The head man's unreliably described, no photographs. 
I want you to set me up.

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.199
With Janus.
Are you sure you want to do this?

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.269
Alec?
Her Majesty's loyal terrier.
No pithy comeback?

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.260
I trusted you, Alec.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.379
England is about to learn the cost of betrayal.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.700
He was a friend.
And now he is our enemy and you will kill him.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.180
It is that simple.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.659
The trick is to quit while you're still ahead.
That's one trick I've never learned.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.909
The man just won't take a hint.
What an unpleasant surprise.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.990
We aim to please.
Grow up, 007.

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.610
Target is London. 
God save the Queen.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.300
I don't want you running off on some kind of vendetta.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.560
Don't make it personal.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.540
Why can't you just be a good boy and die?
You first.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.300
Full speed.
Ram him!

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:57.800
You can't win.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.900
I'll see you in hell, James.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.720
All of you with your guns, your killing, your death, for what?
It's what keeps me alive.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.100
Bond. Only Bond.
