00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
gear to put on your fusing assembly when

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.460 
gear to put on your fusing assembly when
it<00:01:53.610> arrives<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.180> so<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.810> have<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:54.990> nice<00:01:55.170> fresh

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
it arrives to so you have a nice fresh

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.959 
it arrives to so you have a nice fresh
drivetrain<00:01:56.280> on<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.520> way<00:01:56.610> through

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
drivetrain on the way through

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.230 
drivetrain on the way through
we<00:01:57.630> saw<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.869> 40<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.350> 50<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:58.890> or<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.280> 40<00:01:59.549> 350<00:02:00.119> in

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
we saw the 40 to 50 and or the 40 350 in

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.850 
we saw the 40 to 50 and or the 40 350 in
this<00:02:00.390> configuration<00:02:00.719> so<00:02:01.380> when<00:02:01.530> you<00:02:01.619> buy<00:02:01.799> this

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
this configuration so when you buy this

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.310 
this configuration so when you buy this
machine<00:02:02.450> you're<00:02:03.450> curious<00:02:03.719> to<00:02:03.930> kind<00:02:04.110> of<00:02:04.140> what

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
machine you're curious to kind of what

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.800 
machine you're curious to kind of what
we've<00:02:04.469> done<00:02:04.680> is<00:02:04.890> we've<00:02:05.070> installed<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.810> the

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
we've done is we've installed the the

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.050 
we've done is we've installed the the
new<00:02:06.960> drive<00:02:07.200> line<00:02:07.550> inside<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.580> printer<00:02:08.849> we

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
new drive line inside the printer we

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.790 
new drive line inside the printer we
installed<00:02:09.420> new<00:02:09.569> feed<00:02:09.810> rollers<00:02:10.140> inside<00:02:10.530> here

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
installed new feed rollers inside here

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.040

which is only held on by two screws and
by<00:02:37.290> doing<00:02:37.500> so<00:02:38.240> on<00:02:39.240> the<00:02:39.420> back<00:02:39.570> of<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:39.780> machine

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
by doing so on the back of the machine

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.950 
by doing so on the back of the machine
oh<00:02:40.170> you're<00:02:40.560> real<00:02:40.710> quick

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
oh you're real quick

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.680 
oh you're real quick
just<00:02:42.960> by<00:02:43.080> removing<00:02:43.470> these<00:02:43.590> two<00:02:43.650> screws<00:02:44.690> this

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
just by removing these two screws this

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:51.950 
just by removing these two screws this
is<00:02:45.870> real<00:02:46.110> simple<00:02:50.210> the<00:02:51.210> formatter<00:02:51.600> board<00:02:51.810> will

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
is real simple the formatter board will

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:58.450 
is real simple the formatter board will
come<00:02:52.080> right<00:02:52.290> off<00:02:52.320> and<00:02:52.770> there<00:02:53.070> is<00:02:53.160> no<00:02:53.280> risk<00:02:53.520> of

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.500 

you<00:02:59.460> can<00:02:59.610> see<00:02:59.730> how<00:02:59.790> that<00:02:59.940> formatter<00:03:00.300> board

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
you can see how that formatter board

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.420 
you can see how that formatter board
just<00:03:00.690> slid<00:03:00.930> right<00:03:00.960> out<00:03:01.140> of<00:03:01.260> its<00:03:01.470> socket<00:03:01.530> we're

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
just slid right out of its socket we're

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.680 
just slid right out of its socket we're
gonna<00:03:02.610> set<00:03:02.790> this<00:03:02.910> down<00:03:03.120> right<00:03:03.330> here<00:03:03.510> real

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
gonna set this down right here real

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:13.480 
gonna set this down right here real
quick

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:13.490 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.060 

and<00:03:14.490> you<00:03:14.610> can<00:03:14.730> see<00:03:14.910> that<00:03:15.060> this<00:03:15.210> board<00:03:15.450> just

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
and you can see that this board just

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:18.620 
and you can see that this board just
goes<00:03:17.070> in<00:03:17.250> its<00:03:17.400> socket<00:03:17.580> slides<00:03:18.120> forward<00:03:18.450> and

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
goes in its socket slides forward and

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.780 
goes in its socket slides forward and
again<00:03:18.810> now<00:03:18.990> you<00:03:19.050> would<00:03:19.260> just<00:03:19.380> put<00:03:19.560> the<00:03:19.710> put<00:03:20.670> the

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
again now you would just put the put the

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.480 
again now you would just put the put the
two<00:03:20.940> screws<00:03:21.240> back<00:03:21.420> into<00:03:21.660> place<00:03:21.930> and<00:03:22.400> put<00:03:23.400> your

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.490 
two screws back into place and put your

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:28.970 
two screws back into place and put your
memory<00:03:23.760> cover<00:03:23.970> back<00:03:24.210> on<00:03:27.500> at<00:03:28.500> that<00:03:28.680> point<00:03:28.920> in

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
memory cover back on at that point in

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.170

and running again we provide you the
core<00:04:07.580> we've<00:04:08.240> done<00:04:08.540> the<00:04:08.800> kind<00:04:09.800> of<00:04:09.890> the<00:04:09.950> big

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
core we've done the kind of the big

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.980 
core we've done the kind of the big
surgery<00:04:10.850> part<00:04:11.090> of<00:04:11.210> it<00:04:11.330> by<00:04:11.450> installing<00:04:11.900> the<00:04:11.960> new

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:11.990 
surgery part of it by installing the new

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:13.630 
surgery part of it by installing the new
driveline<00:04:12.560> we<00:04:12.710> put<00:04:12.890> some<00:04:13.010> new<00:04:13.040> feed<00:04:13.370> rollers

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
driveline we put some new feed rollers

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.220 
driveline we put some new feed rollers
in<00:04:13.820> here<00:04:14.030> so<00:04:14.570> you're<00:04:14.690> basically<00:04:15.080> just

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
in here so you're basically just
