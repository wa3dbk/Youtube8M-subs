00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
can let's see it can get close up on

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.560 
can let's see it can get close up on
here<00:01:46.890> where<00:01:47.890> there<00:01:48.040> it<00:01:48.130> is<00:01:48.250> the<00:01:49.090> granulated

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
here where there it is the granulated

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.860 
here where there it is the granulated
chicken<00:01:49.720> flavor<00:01:50.350> sweet<00:01:50.530> bass<00:01:50.860> mix<00:01:51.220> okay<00:01:52.210> so

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:52.870 
chicken flavor sweet bass mix okay so

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.609 
chicken flavor sweet bass mix okay so
let's<00:01:53.350> get<00:01:53.500> started

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.080 

all<00:01:57.619> right<00:01:57.799> so<00:01:58.070> first<00:01:58.280> go<00:01:58.549> ahead<00:01:58.640> and<00:01:58.759> wash

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
all right so first go ahead and wash

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.389 
all right so first go ahead and wash
your<00:01:59.329> bitter<00:01:59.539> melons<00:01:59.960> and<00:02:00.229> then<00:02:00.829> cut<00:02:01.039> the<00:02:01.159> tips

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
your bitter melons and then cut the tips

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:03.819 
your bitter melons and then cut the tips
off<00:02:01.610> right<00:02:02.030> here<00:02:02.180> and<00:02:02.509> then<00:02:03.140> therefore<00:02:03.560> the

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 
off right here and then therefore the

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:05.560 
off right here and then therefore the
smaller<00:02:04.159> one<00:02:04.430> I'm<00:02:04.670> gonna<00:02:04.850> cut<00:02:05.000> it<00:02:05.090> into<00:02:05.210> thirds

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
smaller one I'm gonna cut it into thirds

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.259 
smaller one I'm gonna cut it into thirds
and<00:02:06.049> I<00:02:06.530> don't<00:02:07.009> think<00:02:07.399> that<00:02:07.490> much<00:02:07.579> meat<00:02:07.909> in<00:02:07.939> here

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:08.269 
and I don't think that much meat in here

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:11.199 
and I don't think that much meat in here
so<00:02:08.629> I'll<00:02:09.379> probably<00:02:09.560> use<00:02:09.800> three<00:02:10.580> or<00:02:10.610> four<00:02:10.789> I'm

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
so I'll probably use three or four I'm

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.540 
so I'll probably use three or four I'm
not<00:02:11.390> too<00:02:11.569> sure<00:02:11.750> how<00:02:11.780> much<00:02:12.080> I<00:02:12.379> can<00:02:12.739> stuff<00:02:13.220> into

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
not too sure how much I can stuff into

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.780 
not too sure how much I can stuff into
these<00:02:13.790> bitter<00:02:14.569> melons<00:02:14.989> but<00:02:15.980> whatever's<00:02:16.580> left

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
these bitter melons but whatever's left

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.210 
these bitter melons but whatever's left
over<00:02:17.120> of<00:02:17.150> the<00:02:17.660> bitter<00:02:17.900> melons<00:02:18.290> I'll<00:02:18.530> use<00:02:18.950> to

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
over of the bitter melons I'll use to

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.390 
over of the bitter melons I'll use to
stir-fry<00:02:20.209> with<00:02:20.239> some<00:02:20.599> egg<00:02:20.810> tomorrow<00:02:21.440> all

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
stir-fry with some egg tomorrow all

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.470 
stir-fry with some egg tomorrow all
right<00:02:22.640> so<00:02:22.790> let<00:02:22.910> me<00:02:22.940> go<00:02:23.090> ahead<00:02:23.239> and<00:02:23.360> finish

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
right so let me go ahead and finish

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.180 
right so let me go ahead and finish
doing<00:02:23.780> this<00:02:24.019> and<00:02:24.290> once<00:02:24.410> I<00:02:24.530> cut<00:02:24.769> them<00:02:24.920> into

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
doing this and once I cut them into

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.030 
doing this and once I cut them into
smaller<00:02:25.640> pieces<00:02:25.790> then<00:02:26.629> you'll<00:02:27.049> just<00:02:27.260> take<00:02:27.590> the

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
smaller pieces then you'll just take the

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.400 
smaller pieces then you'll just take the
stuff<00:02:28.970> inside<00:02:29.420> and<00:02:29.810> then<00:02:30.410> scoop<00:02:30.650> it<00:02:30.769> out<00:02:32.410> this

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
stuff inside and then scoop it out this

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.030 
stuff inside and then scoop it out this
is<00:02:33.590> how<00:02:33.769> I<00:02:33.799> normally<00:02:34.310> take<00:02:34.640> the<00:02:34.760> insides<00:02:35.209> out

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
is how I normally take the insides out

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.420 
is how I normally take the insides out
for<00:02:37.040> example<00:02:37.489> this<00:02:37.730> here<00:02:38.120> I<00:02:38.329> would<00:02:39.019> just<00:02:39.430> cut

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
for example this here I would just cut

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.319 
for example this here I would just cut
around<00:02:41.079> s<00:02:42.079> so<00:02:42.739> like<00:02:42.980> that<00:02:43.190> cut<00:02:43.940> all<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:44.209> way

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329 
around s so like that cut all the way

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:46.330 
around s so like that cut all the way
around<00:02:44.630> and<00:02:44.989> then<00:02:45.590> it's<00:02:45.920> gonna<00:02:46.069> look<00:02:46.280> like

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
around and then it's gonna look like

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.880 
around and then it's gonna look like
this<00:02:46.730> and<00:02:47.000> then<00:02:47.090> I<00:02:47.120> just<00:02:47.299> simply<00:02:47.630> push<00:02:47.900> push

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
this and then I just simply push push

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.400 
this and then I just simply push push
the<00:02:49.099> insides<00:02:49.579> out<00:02:49.880> with<00:02:50.390> my<00:02:50.540> thumb<00:02:50.810> and<00:02:51.079> it
