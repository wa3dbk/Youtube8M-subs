00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.510 
we could fly these giant jumbo jets
biochem<00:02:06.759> so<00:02:07.210> they<00:02:07.840> did<00:02:08.200> they<00:02:09.039> need<00:02:09.190> to<00:02:09.280> come<00:02:09.399> up

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
biochem so they did they need to come up
with<00:02:09.580> a<00:02:09.819> solution<00:02:09.970> but<00:02:10.330> we<00:02:11.260> as<00:02:12.000> in<00:02:13.000> this<00:02:13.209> group
