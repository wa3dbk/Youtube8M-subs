today's<00:00:17.130> tutorial<00:00:18.680> I'm<00:00:19.680> going<00:00:19.800> to

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
today's tutorial I'm going to

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.440 
today's tutorial I'm going to
double-click<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.700> background<00:00:21.119> layer<00:00:21.210> to

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:21.450 
double-click the background layer to

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.120 
double-click the background layer to
make<00:00:21.540> it<00:00:21.689> workable<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.259> we're<00:00:22.560> going<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.800> zoom

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
make it workable and we're going to zoom

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.819 
make it workable and we're going to zoom
in<00:00:23.340> onto<00:00:23.579> our<00:00:23.880> subjects<00:00:24.329> I<00:00:24.560> so<00:00:25.560> now<00:00:25.650> that<00:00:25.770> we

00:00:25.819 --> 00:00:25.829 
in onto our subjects I so now that we

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:27.650 
in onto our subjects I so now that we
have<00:00:25.860> that<00:00:25.980> done<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.910> first<00:00:27.180> step<00:00:27.360> is<00:00:27.599> to

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
have that done the first step is to

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.260 
have that done the first step is to
create<00:00:28.079> a<00:00:28.230> selection<00:00:28.560> of<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.489> color<00:00:29.820> part<00:00:30.150> of

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:30.270 
create a selection of the color part of

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:31.609 
create a selection of the color part of
the<00:00:30.360> eye<00:00:30.390> so<00:00:31.110> we're<00:00:31.200> going<00:00:31.290> to<00:00:31.380> do<00:00:31.439> this<00:00:31.560> by

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
the eye so we're going to do this by

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.740 
the eye so we're going to do this by
grabbing<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.189> pen<00:00:32.399> tool<00:00:32.600> then<00:00:33.600> we're<00:00:33.720> just

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
grabbing the pen tool then we're just

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.600 
grabbing the pen tool then we're just
going<00:00:33.989> to<00:00:34.110> click<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:34.829> make<00:00:34.980> some<00:00:35.130> points<00:00:35.489> and

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
going to click and make some points and

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.639 
going to click and make some points and
we're<00:00:35.700> just<00:00:35.760> going<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:36.000> drag<00:00:36.239> around<00:00:36.480> on<00:00:36.899> make

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
we're just going to drag around on make

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.290 
we're just going to drag around on make
the<00:00:37.800> curve<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.190> eye<00:00:38.309> and<00:00:39.059> we're<00:00:39.180> just

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
the curve of the eye and we're just

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.729 
the curve of the eye and we're just
going<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.449> try<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:39.690> get<00:00:39.870> just<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.199> color<00:00:40.379> part

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
going to try and get just the color part

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.470 
going to try and get just the color part
and<00:00:41.660> once<00:00:42.660> we<00:00:42.899> have<00:00:43.079> that<00:00:43.109> done<00:00:43.850> and<00:00:44.850> finish

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
and once we have that done and finish

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.529 
and once we have that done and finish
off<00:00:45.660> our<00:00:45.840> path<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.670> then<00:00:47.670> we<00:00:47.850> can<00:00:48.059> take<00:00:48.269> and

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
off our path and then we can take and

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:49.880 
off our path and then we can take and
inside<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.140> path<00:00:49.350> with<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.679> pen<00:00:49.859> tool

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
inside of the path with the pen tool

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.860 
inside of the path with the pen tool
we're<00:00:50.250> going<00:00:50.399> to<00:00:50.519> right<00:00:50.699> click<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:51.239> go<00:00:51.269> to

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
we're going to right click and go to

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.319 
we're going to right click and go to
make<00:00:52.440> selection<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.160> that's<00:00:54.030> going<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.239> bring

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
make selection and that's going to bring

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.759 
make selection and that's going to bring
up<00:00:54.390> this<00:00:54.539> box<00:00:54.600> so<00:00:54.929> we're<00:00:55.050> going<00:00:55.140> to<00:00:55.230> put<00:00:55.320> three

00:00:55.759 --> 00:00:55.769 
up this box so we're going to put three

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:58.160 
up this box so we're going to put three
in<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.100> feather<00:00:56.309> radius<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.969> click<00:00:57.120> ok<00:00:57.449> so

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
in the feather radius and click ok so

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.479 
in the feather radius and click ok so
that's<00:00:58.289> going<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.469> feather<00:00:58.679> the<00:00:58.890> outside<00:00:59.280> so

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
that's going to feather the outside so

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.189 
that's going to feather the outside so
it<00:00:59.550> doesn't<00:00:59.820> make<00:00:59.940> such<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.390> hard<00:01:00.660> selection

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
it doesn't make such a hard selection

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.169 
it doesn't make such a hard selection
and<00:01:02.129> once<00:01:02.370> we<00:01:02.489> have<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:02.640> done<00:01:02.910> we're<00:01:03.059> going

00:01:03.169 --> 00:01:03.179 
and once we have that done we're going

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:05.600 
and once we have that done we're going
to<00:01:03.329> go<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.449> image<00:01:03.839> adjustments<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:05.250> curves

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
to go to image adjustments and curves

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.190 
to go to image adjustments and curves
we're<00:01:06.210> going<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.510> adjust<00:01:06.870> the<00:01:06.990> overall

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
we're going to adjust the overall

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.290 
we're going to adjust the overall
brightness<00:01:08.040> of<00:01:08.400> this<00:01:08.490> I<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.850> bring<00:01:09.000> out<00:01:09.120> some

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:09.300 
brightness of this I and bring out some

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.590 
brightness of this I and bring out some
of<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.450> color<00:01:09.660> so<00:01:10.410> with<00:01:10.620> the<00:01:10.740> RGB<00:01:11.600> channel

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.150 
of the color so with the RGB channel
selected<00:01:13.140> we're<00:01:13.350> going<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.650> just<00:01:13.830> bring<00:01:14.040> up

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:14.160 
selected we're going to just bring up

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.640 
selected we're going to just bring up
this<00:01:14.340> line<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.670> little<00:01:15.090> bit<00:01:15.260> you<00:01:16.260> can<00:01:16.380> see<00:01:16.440> that

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
this line a little bit you can see that

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.020 
this line a little bit you can see that
that's<00:01:16.770> already<00:01:17.010> brightening<00:01:17.670> up<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.820> eye<00:01:17.940> a

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
that's already brightening up the eye a

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.580 
that's already brightening up the eye a
little<00:01:18.180> bit<00:01:18.480> compared<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.050> other<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.290> this

eye now you don't want to go too far

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.430 
eye now you don't want to go too far

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
because you wanted to look like the Hulk

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.200 
because you wanted to look like the Hulk
but<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.280> do<00:01:38.370> want<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.580> bring<00:01:38.730> out<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.970> green<00:01:39.180> a

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
but you do want to bring out the green a

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.420 
but you do want to bring out the green a
little<00:01:39.300> bit<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.810> enhance<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.950> iomega<00:01:41.280> a

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
little bit to enhance the iomega a

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.530 
little bit to enhance the iomega a
little<00:01:41.580> bit<00:01:41.670> more<00:01:41.790> vivid<00:01:42.150> so<00:01:42.240> I'm<00:01:42.300> just<00:01:42.420> going

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
little bit more vivid so I'm just going

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.080 
little bit more vivid so I'm just going
to<00:01:42.600> deselect<00:01:43.410> and<00:01:43.770> we<00:01:43.830> can<00:01:43.980> go<00:01:44.130> out<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.310> see

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
to deselect and we can go out and see

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.150 
to deselect and we can go out and see
what<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.360> looks<00:01:45.420> like<00:01:45.860> that's<00:01:46.860> looking

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:47.160 
what that looks like that's looking

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.580 
what that looks like that's looking
pretty<00:01:47.190> nice<00:01:47.870> so<00:01:48.870> we<00:01:48.960> can<00:01:49.050> just<00:01:49.170> go<00:01:49.260> back<00:01:49.290> in

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
pretty nice so we can just go back in

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.540 
pretty nice so we can just go back in
and<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.800> next<00:01:50.010> thing<00:01:50.160> that<00:01:50.220> we're<00:01:50.370> going<00:01:50.490> to

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:50.550 
and the next thing that we're going to

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:52.850 
and the next thing that we're going to
do<00:01:50.670> is<00:01:50.910> we're<00:01:51.660> going<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.870> enhance<00:01:52.230> this<00:01:52.500> pupil

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
do is we're going to enhance this pupil

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.650 
do is we're going to enhance this pupil
right<00:01:53.160> here<00:01:53.370> so<00:01:54.090> I'm<00:01:54.150> just<00:01:54.240> going<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.420> create

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
right here so I'm just going to create

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.900 
right here so I'm just going to create
another<00:01:55.020> layer<00:01:55.400> we're<00:01:56.400> going<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.580> grab<00:01:56.760> the

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
another layer we're going to grab the

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.820 
another layer we're going to grab the
elliptical<00:01:57.480> marquee<00:01:57.600> tool<00:01:57.840> if<00:01:58.380> it's<00:01:58.650> on<00:01:58.800> the

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
elliptical marquee tool if it's on the

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.440 
elliptical marquee tool if it's on the
rectangular<00:01:59.370> just<00:01:59.700> hold<00:01:59.880> down<00:01:59.970> and<00:02:00.300> go<00:02:00.420> to

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
rectangular just hold down and go to

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.630 
rectangular just hold down and go to
elliptical<00:02:01.320> marquee<00:02:01.470> and<00:02:01.890> then<00:02:02.490> we're<00:02:02.610> just

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
elliptical marquee and then we're just

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.630 
elliptical marquee and then we're just
going<00:02:02.910> to<00:02:03.060> create<00:02:03.570> any<00:02:04.380> lips<00:02:04.830> over<00:02:05.190> the<00:02:05.280> top<00:02:05.490> of

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
going to create any lips over the top of

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.550 
going to create any lips over the top of
the<00:02:05.730> pupil<00:02:06.090> so<00:02:06.660> you<00:02:06.750> can<00:02:06.900> hold<00:02:07.050> shift<00:02:07.320> if<00:02:07.440> you

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
the pupil so you can hold shift if you

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.109 
the pupil so you can hold shift if you
want<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.800> be<00:02:07.860> a<00:02:07.920> perfect<00:02:08.280> circle<00:02:08.489> or<00:02:08.789> you<00:02:09.000> can

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
want to be a perfect circle or you can

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.240 
want to be a perfect circle or you can
just<00:02:09.269> freeform<00:02:09.750> it<00:02:10.080> by<00:02:10.319> not<00:02:10.679> holding<00:02:10.860> shift

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
just freeform it by not holding shift

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.100 
just freeform it by not holding shift
and<00:02:11.340> then<00:02:11.940> you<00:02:12.060> can<00:02:12.209> move<00:02:12.390> your<00:02:12.450> selection

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
and then you can move your selection

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.130 
and then you can move your selection
around<00:02:13.200> by<00:02:13.470> holding<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:14.400> spacebar<00:02:15.140> so

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
around by holding the spacebar so

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.090 
around by holding the spacebar so
basically<00:02:16.410> what<00:02:16.590> we're<00:02:16.680> trying<00:02:16.830> to<00:02:16.920> do<00:02:17.010> is

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
basically what we're trying to do is

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.770 
basically what we're trying to do is
just<00:02:17.130> get<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.520> shape<00:02:17.730> of<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.210> pupil<00:02:18.570> that's

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
just get the shape of the pupil that's

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:19.309 
just get the shape of the pupil that's
currently

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
currently

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:20.599 
currently
and<00:02:19.530> we're<00:02:19.620> going<00:02:19.650> to<00:02:19.799> make<00:02:19.890> it<00:02:20.010> a<00:02:20.069> solid<00:02:20.459> color

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:20.609 
and we're going to make it a solid color

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:23.509 
and we're going to make it a solid color
rather<00:02:20.939> than<00:02:21.209> the<00:02:21.719> kind<00:02:22.019> of<00:02:22.140> milky<00:02:22.920> color<00:02:23.280> that

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
rather than the kind of milky color that

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.429 
rather than the kind of milky color that
it<00:02:23.609> already<00:02:23.849> is<00:02:24.030> so<00:02:24.599> we're<00:02:24.719> just<00:02:24.749> going<00:02:24.989> to<00:02:25.170> go

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:25.439 
it already is so we're just going to go

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:27.080 
it already is so we're just going to go
over<00:02:25.499> that<00:02:25.769> and<00:02:26.069> then<00:02:26.400> let<00:02:26.579> go<00:02:26.730> once<00:02:26.909> you're

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
over that and then let go once you're

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.050 
over that and then let go once you're
done<00:02:27.239> then<00:02:27.959> we're<00:02:28.049> going<00:02:28.139> to<00:02:28.230> go<00:02:28.319> to<00:02:28.349> select

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
done then we're going to go to select

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.940 
done then we're going to go to select
modify<00:02:30.060> feather<00:02:31.019> we're<00:02:31.680> going<00:02:31.799> to<00:02:31.859> follow

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
modify feather we're going to follow

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.429 
modify feather we're going to follow
that<00:02:32.189> by<00:02:32.340> three<00:02:32.760> pixels<00:02:33.109> so<00:02:34.109> that's<00:02:34.290> just

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:34.439 
that by three pixels so that's just

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:36.470 
that by three pixels so that's just
going<00:02:34.530> to<00:02:34.620> give<00:02:34.680> us<00:02:34.889> again<00:02:35.310> not<00:02:35.909> such<00:02:36.150> a<00:02:36.180> hard

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
going to give us again not such a hard

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.440 
going to give us again not such a hard
selection<00:02:36.989> then<00:02:37.500> we're<00:02:37.590> going<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.769> go<00:02:37.889> to<00:02:37.920> edit

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
selection then we're going to go to edit

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.080 
selection then we're going to go to edit
fill<00:02:39.450> and<00:02:39.689> then<00:02:40.170> go<00:02:40.530> down<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:40.709> color<00:02:41.069> and<00:02:41.370> then

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
fill and then go down to color and then

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.220 
fill and then go down to color and then
we're<00:02:42.209> just<00:02:42.239> going<00:02:42.420> us<00:02:42.540> like<00:02:42.689> black<00:02:42.959> which<00:02:43.200> is

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
we're just going us like black which is

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.740 
we're just going us like black which is
all<00:02:43.590> zeros<00:02:44.069> and<00:02:44.730> click<00:02:44.969> OK<00:02:45.269> and<00:02:45.299> you<00:02:45.419> can<00:02:45.569> see

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
all zeros and click OK and you can see

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.259 
all zeros and click OK and you can see
that<00:02:45.780> it's<00:02:45.989> filled<00:02:46.230> that<00:02:46.409> right<00:02:46.620> there<00:02:47.150> so<00:02:48.150> now

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
that it's filled that right there so now

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.559 
that it's filled that right there so now
we<00:02:48.329> can<00:02:48.510> just<00:02:48.749> label<00:02:49.349> that<00:02:49.469> people<00:02:50.419> all<00:02:51.419> right

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:52.970 
we can just label that people all right
and<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:52.230> next<00:02:52.409> thing<00:02:52.530> we're<00:02:52.650> going<00:02:52.739> to<00:02:52.799> do<00:02:52.889> is

and the next thing we're going to do is
add<00:02:53.159> a<00:02:53.189> highlight<00:02:53.430> within<00:02:53.969> that<00:02:54.090> pupil<00:02:54.510> so

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:54.659 
add a highlight within that pupil so

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:56.959 
add a highlight within that pupil so
we're<00:02:54.810> just<00:02:54.840> going<00:02:55.169> to<00:02:55.230> make<00:02:55.709> a<00:02:55.739> new<00:02:55.919> layer<00:02:56.129> go

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:56.969 
we're just going to make a new layer go

00:02:56.969 --> 00:02:58.399 
we're just going to make a new layer go
down<00:02:57.180> and<00:02:57.480> make<00:02:57.569> sure<00:02:57.629> that<00:02:57.810> your<00:02:58.049> foreground

00:02:58.399 --> 00:02:58.409 
down and make sure that your foreground

60 just so it's not noxious Lee white
there<00:03:27.599> may<00:03:27.750> be<00:03:27.780> a<00:03:27.900> little<00:03:28.079> bit<00:03:28.259> more<00:03:28.409> me<00:03:28.739> put<00:03:28.979> it

make<00:04:40.970> selection<00:04:41.539> and<00:04:41.720> again<00:04:42.229> we're<00:04:42.379> going<00:04:42.470> to

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
make selection and again we're going to

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.969 
make selection and again we're going to
put<00:04:42.680> it<00:04:42.770> at<00:04:42.889> three<00:04:43.449> for<00:04:44.449> the<00:04:44.690> feathering<00:04:45.080> then

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:45.979 
put it at three for the feathering then

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:47.200 
put it at three for the feathering then
for<00:04:46.400> this<00:04:46.520> one<00:04:46.669> we're<00:04:46.819> going<00:04:46.940> to<00:04:47.060> go<00:04:47.150> to

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
for this one we're going to go to

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.320 
for this one we're going to go to
adjustments<00:04:47.360> and<00:04:47.840> then<00:04:47.960> curves<00:04:48.259> again<00:04:48.560> and<00:04:49.330> it

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
adjustments and then curves again and it

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:51.249 
adjustments and then curves again and it
says<00:04:50.539> that<00:04:50.659> we<00:04:50.720> don't<00:04:50.870> have<00:04:50.960> a<00:04:51.020> selection

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:51.259 
says that we don't have a selection

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:53.740 
says that we don't have a selection
because<00:04:51.500> i<00:04:51.740> was<00:04:51.979> on<00:04:52.099> the<00:04:52.699> white<00:04:53.270> layer<00:04:53.479> that<00:04:53.659> we

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
because i was on the white layer that we

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.649 
because i was on the white layer that we
created<00:04:54.110> rather<00:04:54.830> than<00:04:55.159> this<00:04:55.580> the<00:04:56.210> base<00:04:56.389> layer

00:04:56.649 --> 00:04:56.659 
created rather than this the base layer

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:58.450 
created rather than this the base layer
let's<00:04:56.870> just<00:04:57.050> get<00:04:57.710> rid<00:04:57.860> of<00:04:57.919> the<00:04:58.069> white<00:04:58.250> layer

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
let's just get rid of the white layer

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.129 
let's just get rid of the white layer
and<00:04:59.000> we'll<00:04:59.210> go<00:04:59.330> back<00:04:59.449> to<00:04:59.509> the<00:04:59.720> base<00:04:59.870> layer

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:00.139 
and we'll go back to the base layer

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:01.809 
and we'll go back to the base layer
where<00:05:00.380> there's<00:05:00.560> actually<00:05:00.979> content<00:05:01.370> there<00:05:01.610> and

00:05:01.809 --> 00:05:01.819 
where there's actually content there and

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:05.110 
where there's actually content there and
we're<00:05:02.419> going<00:05:02.539> to<00:05:02.889> go<00:05:03.889> to<00:05:03.949> image<00:05:04.400> and<00:05:04.580> then

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
we're going to go to image and then

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.430 
we're going to go to image and then
we're<00:05:05.210> going<00:05:05.330> to<00:05:05.449> go<00:05:05.539> to<00:05:05.569> adjustments<00:05:05.780> and

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
we're going to go to adjustments and

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.070 
we're going to go to adjustments and
then<00:05:06.860> curves<00:05:07.270> and<00:05:08.270> for<00:05:08.599> this<00:05:08.720> one<00:05:08.900> we<00:05:09.050> just

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
then curves and for this one we just

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.689 
then curves and for this one we just
want<00:05:09.409> to<00:05:09.470> be<00:05:09.560> on<00:05:09.650> the<00:05:09.740> RGB<00:05:10.220> and<00:05:10.250> then<00:05:10.610> we're

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:10.699 
want to be on the RGB and then we're

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:12.010 
want to be on the RGB and then we're
just<00:05:10.729> going<00:05:10.940> to<00:05:11.000> raise<00:05:11.210> it<00:05:11.360> up<00:05:11.419> a<00:05:11.569> little<00:05:11.780> bit

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
just going to raise it up a little bit

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.300 
just going to raise it up a little bit
we're<00:05:12.349> just<00:05:12.409> going<00:05:12.590> to<00:05:12.620> try<00:05:12.830> and<00:05:12.860> brighten

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
we're just going to try and brighten

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.670 
we're just going to try and brighten
that<00:05:13.400> up<00:05:13.460> a<00:05:13.699> little<00:05:13.819> bit<00:05:14.440> you<00:05:15.440> can<00:05:15.560> see<00:05:15.650> that

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
that up a little bit you can see that

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.520 
that up a little bit you can see that
that's<00:05:16.060> brightened<00:05:17.060> nicely<00:05:18.050> there<00:05:18.229> so<00:05:18.409> we're

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
that's brightened nicely there so we're

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:21.279 
that's brightened nicely there so we're
going<00:05:18.680> to<00:05:18.770> click<00:05:18.800> OK<00:05:19.280> we<00:05:20.030> can<00:05:20.180> deselect<00:05:20.539> and

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:21.289 
going to click OK we can deselect and

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:24.219 
going to click OK we can deselect and
you<00:05:21.440> can<00:05:21.590> see<00:05:21.770> when<00:05:21.919> we<00:05:22.039> zoom<00:05:22.069> out<00:05:23.020> that<00:05:24.020> that's

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:24.229 
you can see when we zoom out that that's

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:26.950 
you can see when we zoom out that that's
definitely<00:05:24.770> a<00:05:24.860> nice<00:05:25.370> brighter<00:05:26.000> part<00:05:26.539> of<00:05:26.780> the

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
definitely a nice brighter part of the

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.740 
definitely a nice brighter part of the
eye<00:05:26.990> you<00:05:27.110> can<00:05:27.560> see<00:05:27.819> where<00:05:28.819> it<00:05:28.909> was<00:05:29.060> before<00:05:29.270> and

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750 
eye you can see where it was before and

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.850 
eye you can see where it was before and
then<00:05:30.050> after<00:05:31.659> before<00:05:32.659> for<00:05:33.139> the<00:05:33.199> whole<00:05:33.380> I<00:05:33.409> and

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:33.860 
then after before for the whole I and

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:36.459 
then after before for the whole I and
then<00:05:34.520> after<00:05:34.969> you<00:05:35.630> can<00:05:35.659> see<00:05:35.900> we<00:05:36.050> have<00:05:36.139> a<00:05:36.169> much

00:05:36.459 --> 00:05:36.469 
then after you can see we have a much

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:37.930 
then after you can see we have a much
more<00:05:36.710> vibrant<00:05:36.919> I<00:05:37.190> now<00:05:37.400> if<00:05:37.490> you<00:05:37.580> took<00:05:37.729> a<00:05:37.849> little

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:37.940 
more vibrant I now if you took a little

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.999 
more vibrant I now if you took a little
bit<00:05:38.090> more<00:05:38.270> time<00:05:38.509> to<00:05:38.719> make<00:05:38.840> some<00:05:39.080> nice<00:05:39.560> clean

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:40.009 
bit more time to make some nice clean

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:42.519 
bit more time to make some nice clean
clear<00:05:40.610> paths<00:05:41.569> around<00:05:41.870> the<00:05:42.110> eye<00:05:42.139> then<00:05:42.440> you

00:05:42.519 --> 00:05:42.529 
clear paths around the eye then you

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:45.070 
clear paths around the eye then you
could<00:05:42.710> get<00:05:42.800> a<00:05:42.860> much<00:05:43.190> nicer<00:05:43.449> cleaner<00:05:44.449> crisper

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 
could get a much nicer cleaner crisper

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.930 
could get a much nicer cleaner crisper
edge<00:05:45.469> around<00:05:45.889> those<00:05:46.190> paths<00:05:46.460> and<00:05:46.729> it<00:05:46.819> would

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
edge around those paths and it would

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.149 
edge around those paths and it would
look<00:05:47.060> a<00:05:47.180> little<00:05:47.419> bit<00:05:47.599> nicer<00:05:47.750> but<00:05:48.169> um<00:05:48.349> for<00:05:49.069> the

00:05:49.149 --> 00:05:49.159 
look a little bit nicer but um for the

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:51.339 
look a little bit nicer but um for the
basic<00:05:49.520> part<00:05:49.729> this<00:05:49.909> is<00:05:50.090> a<00:05:50.120> definitely<00:05:50.900> enhanced

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:51.349 
basic part this is a definitely enhanced

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:52.959 
basic part this is a definitely enhanced
from<00:05:51.500> where<00:05:51.680> it<00:05:51.770> was<00:05:51.800> before<00:05:52.069> safe<00:05:52.550> using<00:05:52.759> them

00:05:52.959 --> 00:05:52.969 
from where it was before safe using them

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:56.110 
from where it was before safe using them
out<00:05:53.060> you<00:05:53.210> can<00:05:53.360> see<00:05:53.599> how<00:05:54.169> she<00:05:54.500> looks<00:05:55.069> with<00:05:55.789> one

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.120 
out you can see how she looks with one

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.999 
out you can see how she looks with one
in<00:05:56.240> he<00:05:56.360> s<00:05:56.449> die<00:05:56.630> and<00:05:56.870> then<00:05:56.960> one<00:05:57.199> not<00:05:57.409> so<00:05:57.620> enhanced

00:05:57.999 --> 00:05:58.009 
in he s die and then one not so enhanced

00:05:58.009 --> 00:05:59.740 
in he s die and then one not so enhanced
I<00:05:58.069> you<00:05:58.130> can<00:05:58.340> see<00:05:58.550> the<00:05:58.699> difference<00:05:59.060> quite

00:05:59.740 --> 00:05:59.750 
I you can see the difference quite

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.170 
I you can see the difference quite
clearly<00:06:00.080> there<00:06:00.729> compared<00:06:01.729> to<00:06:01.789> the<00:06:01.969> other<00:06:02.120> eye

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:02.180 
clearly there compared to the other eye

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.439 
clearly there compared to the other eye
so<00:06:03.050> this<00:06:03.259> is<00:06:03.289> a<00:06:03.409> nice<00:06:03.650> little<00:06:04.300> effect<00:06:05.300> that<00:06:05.419> you

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:05.449 
so this is a nice little effect that you

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:07.300 
so this is a nice little effect that you
can<00:06:05.659> use<00:06:05.870> on<00:06:05.900> your<00:06:06.139> images<00:06:06.650> to<00:06:06.800> make<00:06:06.949> the<00:06:07.099> eyes

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.310 
can use on your images to make the eyes

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.999 
can use on your images to make the eyes
and<00:06:07.639> a<00:06:07.699> lot<00:06:08.029> nicer<00:06:08.240> you<00:06:09.199> can<00:06:09.349> see<00:06:09.500> definitely

00:06:09.999 --> 00:06:10.009 
and a lot nicer you can see definitely

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:11.409 
and a lot nicer you can see definitely
the<00:06:10.190> difference<00:06:10.520> between<00:06:10.849> this<00:06:11.000> eye<00:06:11.180> on<00:06:11.300> this

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:11.419 
the difference between this eye on this

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:13.959 
the difference between this eye on this
I<00:06:11.630> so<00:06:12.020> if<00:06:12.979> you're<00:06:13.159> looking<00:06:13.310> for<00:06:13.520> some<00:06:13.819> way<00:06:13.940> to
