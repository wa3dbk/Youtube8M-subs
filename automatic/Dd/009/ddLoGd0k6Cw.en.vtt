couristan<00:00:02.149> hello<00:00:03.149> guys<00:00:03.389> today<00:00:04.040> I'm<00:00:05.040> going<00:00:05.310> to

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
couristan hello guys today I'm going to

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.670 
couristan hello guys today I'm going to
show<00:00:05.580> you<00:00:05.640> how<00:00:05.790> to<00:00:06.000> make<00:00:06.150> a<00:00:06.299> paper<00:00:06.420> plane<00:00:06.960> boom

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
show you how to make a paper plane boom

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.379 
show you how to make a paper plane boom
and<00:00:08.090> it's<00:00:09.090> really<00:00:09.450> simple<00:00:10.639> first<00:00:11.639> you<00:00:12.150> take<00:00:12.360> a

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
and it's really simple first you take a

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.380 
and it's really simple first you take a
page<00:00:12.690> of<00:00:13.160> any<00:00:14.160> went<00:00:16.100> rectangular<00:00:17.390> preferably

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
page of any went rectangular preferably

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.240 
page of any went rectangular preferably
a<00:00:18.480> rectangular<00:00:19.170> page<00:00:20.000> then<00:00:21.000> you<00:00:21.180> just<00:00:21.420> fold<00:00:21.810> it

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.250 
a rectangular page then you just fold it

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:40.010 
a rectangular page then you just fold it
once<00:00:23.720> like<00:00:24.720> this<00:00:32.690> out<00:00:33.690> holding<00:00:34.290> this<00:00:36.440> you<00:00:39.020> fold

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
once like this out holding this you fold

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:47.510 
once like this out holding this you fold
it<00:00:40.140> again<00:00:40.290> like<00:00:40.649> this<00:00:44.629> and<00:00:46.129> similarly<00:00:47.129> on<00:00:47.399> the

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
it again like this and similarly on the

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:57.010 
it again like this and similarly on the
other<00:00:47.670> side

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.380 

the<00:00:58.020> plane<00:00:58.380> should<00:00:58.410> look<00:00:58.890> like<00:00:59.390> something

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
the plane should look like something

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:08.710 
the plane should look like something
like<00:01:00.600> this<00:01:03.140> then<00:01:04.520> you<00:01:05.520> turn<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.380> in<00:01:07.430> the

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
like this then you turn it in the

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:17.510 
like this then you turn it in the
opposite<00:01:09.720> direction<00:01:10.400> like<00:01:11.400> this<00:01:16.460> now<00:01:17.460> the

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
opposite direction like this now the

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.250 
opposite direction like this now the
open<00:01:18.390> it's<00:01:18.660> up<00:01:18.930> on<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.320> inside<00:01:19.890> of<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.220> plane

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:21.260 
open it's up on the inside of the plane

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.450 
open it's up on the inside of the plane
after<00:01:22.260> that<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:23.729> have<00:01:23.760> to<00:01:24.000> fold<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.570> again

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
after that you have to fold it again

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:34.520 
after that you have to fold it again
like<00:01:26.460> this

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.510 

make<00:01:35.530> sure<00:01:35.560> you<00:01:36.130> make<00:01:36.369> those<00:01:36.700> edges<00:01:37.149> clean<00:01:38.520> the

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
make sure you make those edges clean the

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.120 
make sure you make those edges clean the
more<00:01:39.759> cleaner<00:01:40.119> beds<00:01:40.509> are<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:42.369> more<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:45.070> I

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
more cleaner beds are the more that I

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.740 
more cleaner beds are the more that I
would<00:01:45.369> beeps<00:01:45.610> flight<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:49.210> have<00:01:49.329> to<00:01:49.479> do<00:01:49.600> the

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
would beeps flight you have to do the

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:58.980 
would beeps flight you have to do the
same<00:01:49.990> on<00:01:50.200> the<00:01:50.319> other<00:01:50.380> side<00:01:57.719> at<00:01:58.719> this<00:01:58.869> point

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
same on the other side at this point

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.520 
same on the other side at this point
your<00:01:59.380> plane<00:01:59.649> should<00:01:59.890> look<00:02:00.100> like<00:02:00.130> this<00:02:03.509> then

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
your plane should look like this then

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:11.460 
your plane should look like this then
you<00:02:05.530> can<00:02:05.679> open<00:02:05.950> it<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:08.700> open<00:02:09.700> these<00:02:10.090> add<00:02:10.479> these

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
you can open it and open these add these

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.990 
you can open it and open these add these
folds<00:02:12.010> also<00:02:13.349> higher<00:02:14.349> plane<00:02:14.709> should<00:02:14.950> be

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
folds also higher plane should be

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.710 
folds also higher plane should be
looking<00:02:16.000> like<00:02:16.239> something<00:02:16.750> like<00:02:17.019> this<00:02:18.720> after

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
looking like something like this after

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.440 
looking like something like this after
that<00:02:19.930> on<00:02:20.170> the<00:02:21.099> inner<00:02:21.250> side<00:02:21.549> of<00:02:21.610> the<00:02:21.819> plane

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:39.970 

folded<00:02:25.450> ones

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:51.850 

and<00:02:41.590> hold<00:02:42.590> it<00:02:42.709> again<00:02:43.010> like<00:02:43.250> this

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:03:00.940 

and<00:02:52.040> then<00:02:53.500> fold<00:02:54.500> it<00:02:54.710> again<00:02:58.780> and<00:02:59.780> now<00:03:00.470> comes<00:03:00.710> the

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
and then fold it again and now comes the

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:13.990 
and then fold it again and now comes the
last<00:03:01.130> fold<00:03:03.400> it<00:03:04.400> should<00:03:04.670> be<00:03:04.850> like<00:03:05.030> this<00:03:13.000> no

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
last fold it should be like this no

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:29.080 
last fold it should be like this no
other<00:03:14.150> side<00:03:26.770> your<00:03:27.770> plane<00:03:28.040> is<00:03:28.070> ready<00:03:28.370> your

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
other side your plane is ready your

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.330 
other side your plane is ready your
paper<00:03:29.420> plane<00:03:29.720> is<00:03:29.900> ready<00:03:30.050> but<00:03:30.320> you<00:03:31.070> want<00:03:31.280> to

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
paper plane is ready but you want to

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.430 
paper plane is ready but you want to
make<00:03:31.520> it<00:03:31.730> a<00:03:32.320> boomerang<00:03:33.320> so<00:03:33.830> what<00:03:34.640> we<00:03:34.820> do<00:03:35.030> is<00:03:35.440> on

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
make it a boomerang so what we do is on

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.900 
make it a boomerang so what we do is on
the<00:03:37.130> left<00:03:37.670> on<00:03:38.209> the<00:03:38.239> right<00:03:38.390> wing<00:03:39.489> you<00:03:40.489> see<00:03:40.520> this

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
the left on the right wing you see this

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.400 
the left on the right wing you see this
is<00:03:41.060> the<00:03:41.180> left<00:03:41.480> thing<00:03:41.750> this<00:03:41.930> is<00:03:42.110> the<00:03:42.230> right

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
is the left thing this is the right

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.890 
is the left thing this is the right
thing<00:03:42.820> we<00:03:43.820> make<00:03:44.030> a<00:03:44.060> little<00:03:44.480> cut<00:03:46.330> not<00:03:47.330> so<00:03:47.600> big

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
thing we make a little cut not so big

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:58.570 
thing we make a little cut not so big
just<00:03:48.680> a<00:03:48.860> little<00:03:51.520> about<00:03:52.520> this<00:03:52.820> much<00:03:56.260> then<00:03:57.580> we

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
just a little about this much then we

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:04.710 
just a little about this much then we
fold<00:03:58.970> it<00:04:00.250> like<00:04:01.250> this

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.069 

you<00:04:05.720> can<00:04:05.900> see<00:04:06.170> how<00:04:06.680> it<00:04:06.709> looks<00:04:07.220> like<00:04:07.569> the<00:04:08.569> card

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:09.079 
you can see how it looks like the card

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:15.460 
you can see how it looks like the card
and<00:04:10.120> the<00:04:11.120> plane<00:04:12.610> after<00:04:13.610> that<00:04:13.730> if<00:04:14.720> you<00:04:14.900> cut<00:04:15.290> this

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
and the plane after that if you cut this

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.400 
and the plane after that if you cut this
on<00:04:15.680> the<00:04:15.769> right<00:04:16.009> wing<00:04:16.570> if<00:04:17.570> you've<00:04:17.780> cut<00:04:18.019> this<00:04:18.199> on

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
on the right wing if you've cut this on

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:24.700 
on the right wing if you've cut this on
the<00:04:18.620> right<00:04:19.310> thing<00:04:20.139> you<00:04:21.139> have<00:04:21.380> to<00:04:23.470> bend<00:04:24.470> your

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
the right thing you have to bend your

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.689 
the right thing you have to bend your
plane<00:04:25.100> on<00:04:25.430> the<00:04:25.960> right<00:04:26.960> side<00:04:27.229> as<00:04:27.440> well<00:04:27.699> then

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:28.699 
plane on the right side as well then

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:32.439 
plane on the right side as well then
you'll<00:04:28.850> have<00:04:28.910> to<00:04:29.210> throw<00:04:29.990> it<00:04:30.139> like<00:04:30.979> this<00:04:31.449> like

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:32.449 
you'll have to throw it like this like

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:35.409 
you'll have to throw it like this like
this<00:04:33.039> if<00:04:34.039> you<00:04:34.100> throw<00:04:34.400> it<00:04:34.460> straight<00:04:34.789> it<00:04:35.060> won't

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
this if you throw it straight it won't

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:38.560 
this if you throw it straight it won't
come<00:04:35.630> back<00:04:35.800> you'll<00:04:36.800> have<00:04:36.860> to<00:04:36.979> bend<00:04:37.280> it<00:04:37.570> only

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
come back you'll have to bend it only

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:41.320 
come back you'll have to bend it only
then<00:04:38.720> it<00:04:38.840> will<00:04:38.960> come<00:04:39.169> back
