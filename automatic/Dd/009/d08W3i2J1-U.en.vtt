00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:12.920 
scenarios unlocked and all the levels

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.130

beaten<00:05:13.390> even<00:05:14.390> though<00:05:14.480> I<00:05:14.510> didn't<00:05:14.930> actually

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.140 
beaten even though I didn't actually

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.410 
beaten even though I didn't actually
play<00:05:15.860> any<00:05:15.890> of<00:05:16.280> them<00:05:16.400> on<00:05:16.580> my<00:05:16.760> iPad

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:17.420 
play any of them on my iPad

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:18.700 
play any of them on my iPad
but<00:05:17.630> now<00:05:17.720> I<00:05:17.750> have<00:05:17.900> access<00:05:18.080> to<00:05:18.380> all<00:05:18.500> of<00:05:18.530> them

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
but now I have access to all of them

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:19.990 
but now I have access to all of them
because<00:05:18.980> I<00:05:19.010> transferred<00:05:19.520> the<00:05:19.550> debt<00:05:19.790> over

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
because I transferred the debt over

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.760 
because I transferred the debt over
something<00:05:20.720> that<00:05:20.750> you<00:05:20.990> usually<00:05:21.200> can't<00:05:21.620> do

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
something that you usually can't do

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.530 
something that you usually can't do
otherwise<00:05:22.070> so<00:05:22.760> I<00:05:22.790> thought<00:05:23.060> this<00:05:23.180> app<00:05:23.360> was

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:23.540 
otherwise so I thought this app was

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.120 
otherwise so I thought this app was
really<00:05:23.840> useful<00:05:24.170> and<00:05:24.290> cool<00:05:24.500> I<00:05:24.530> hope<00:05:24.710> you<00:05:24.920> guys

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
it's a little bit more difficult to use

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.800 
it's a little bit more difficult to use
but<00:05:30.410> all-in-all<00:05:31.070> I<00:05:31.610> strongly<00:05:32.360> recommend
