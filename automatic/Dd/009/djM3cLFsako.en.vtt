 fear the us according to the authors of the magazine 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.680
 until the open confrontation of these two countries 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.300
 unlikely to come because the war 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.710
 will end badly for both conflicting 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.519

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.230
 this plane is an airplane of concern

 unique engines with increased traction 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.640
 and high speed making su-35 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.559
 dangerous opponent for most

 American aircraft except 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:50.129

 adversary out of range 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.930
 weapons china has already expressed a desire 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.539
 purchase this fighter for 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.170
 their air force weapons and North Korea 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.369
 I would not refuse

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.000
 atomic but they are harder to detect and they 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:14.930
 pose a great danger to 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.880
 surface ships 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.549

 Russian project submarines 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.690

 tank t-90 t-90 was the main combat and 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.800
 the most perfect tank of Russians so far in 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.930
 troops did not appear armata 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.180
 although essentially t-90 is deep 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.700
 modernization of the Soviet t-72 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:11.180
 It is much cheaper than foreign leopard 2 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.130
 or m1a 2 abrams and equipped with 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.959

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.080
 interest in the tank also 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.209
 have shown vietnam and several other countries for 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:38.870
 Russia offers them a modernized 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:41.720
 version of the t-90ms antiship 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.220

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.459
 what a serious threat to ships 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.050
 Bramos export option together 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.160
 Russian Indian based development 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:56.510

 kilometers per hour in open sources 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.910
 alleged that for from eight missiles 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.140
 brahmos can destroy the group 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.150
 frigate class ships 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.160

 defense extremely low altitude 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.209

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.280
 land and sea carrier now this 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:23.299
 missiles are in service with the troops 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.730
 India and Russia 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:28.299
 interesting purchases showed vietnam and 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.299
 Egypt 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.390

 combined-cycle peroxide torpedoes 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:43.120
 50 365 are still dangerous 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.370
 torpedoes are equipped with a unique active 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.349
 acoustic homing system with 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.870
 vertical lacquering wake new 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:51.730
 track to get away from such a torpedo practically 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.099
 impossible reliably effective 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.380
 no protection 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:58.480
 course 50 365 may range from 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:01.630
 sixty eight knots at range 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:04.480
 12 kilometers to 44 knots when 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:07.780
 range of 22 kilometers only 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.730
 able to resist 50 365 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:13.239
 is to use the newest american 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:16.479
 protection system with d d deployed on 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:18.790
 board aircraft carrier George Bush reportedly 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:21.040
 that it is capable of detecting running 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.900
 by ship torpedo classify them and 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.479
 calculate the trajectory and issue 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.340
 target designation counter torpedoes but 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:30.190
 protection will come on the us fleet not 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:33.760
 soon it is planned that only by 2035 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:37.050
 with std will be installed on all aircraft carriers 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:40.110
 and ships of special importance
