00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 another best list being 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.930
 best list here is not entirely true 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.280
 because in the game trends 2014 are synonymous 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.380
 things are honest with me 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.360
 did not like it so much but that 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.360
 now you see, let 's go! 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.200
 december is 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.180
 This trend is not so new 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.270
 he has already last year 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:31.279
 announced with the advent of 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.840
 writing and competition projects the 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.020
 now more and more stamp out of the ground 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.120
 you have to say the virtual reality the 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.790
 Sooner or later somehow it will come in 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.530
 i keep our residential or gamer room 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.269
 have this year play several times 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.860
 may be stuck on the eve online fan 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:48.080
 you could for example this battery 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.629
 gamble and who for example by alien 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:53.390
 Isolation has gambled with the inscription 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.699
 the white that makes the play already 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.680
 even more intense at play 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.659
 the designed are horror games 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.489
 for example, they benefit extremely from the 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:03.650
 virtual reality glasses and I can 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.030
 only wish that more projects come 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.960
 really on those glasses 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.210
 are aligned 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.940
 if so, then that may be one of 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.100
 big new dinger 2015 or maybe 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.619
 even in 2016, maybe with 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.640
 a next generation console 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:18.500
 delivered as standard 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.729
 said try it yourself 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.500
 maybe it's at gamescom 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:23.720
 if you are there or you get one 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:30.670
 the developer kits is definitely 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:30.670
 worth a look at the fourth place 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.280
 if 2014 in the annals of the 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.620
 unfortunately, the story of the game is also received 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.690
 because I think it's one of the 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.100
 Buildings last years in terms of 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:47.280
 been controversial 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.400
 gamer gate was the thing this year 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.690
 thing about sexism and 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.520
 incorruptible journalism has turned 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.320
 and then there was flirting at the beginning of the year 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.300
 a cheap together stolen game 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.400
 somehow still governs the market 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.080
 has the makers of candy crash sager 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.390
 wanted to sue everything with candy 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.980
 crash or sager was titled in the name 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.500
 and almost banner sager 2 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:09.510
 prevented then there was something destiny 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.150
 simply not working until today 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:14.970
 or the graphic downgrades started 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.280
 with dark souls 2 or hot stocks many 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.840
 scandals that have shaken this year 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.340
 a maximum was then still end 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.070
 of the year, the one of pranger of 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.500
 ubisoft as representative for many 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.300
 for those same debates this year 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.530
 stand this down to a matter 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:30.690
 It's almost impossible to break that 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:35.030
 are the controversies for you the 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.030
 last trend 2014 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.569
 third place 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:47.030
 This thing is also controversial 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:48.829
 while some say who throws who 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.170
 because the money for such a junk from 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:53.750
 The others say it's beautiful now 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.730
 even simulators give away 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.230
 from this stupid profession of simulation 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.609
 junk and that 's a bit that 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.150
 problem of the last years because 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:01.010
 things like that 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.329
 Farming simulator and like you 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.150
 all of us are called giga 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:07.189
 soon enough to like the plate 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.389
 have the reputation of the simulator tidy 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:10.549
 torn down and come now 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:12.139
 these nonsensical simulators at once 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.969
 such as the gold simulator or 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:16.430
 this year was very big topic 

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:18.409
 or up to date a board where you 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.439
 just bread plays itself things like that 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:23.840
 like the nothing simulator or the stone 

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:26.299
 simulator to be announced 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.859
 sometimes fun but sometimes faith 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:30.620
 I'm also a bit serious about it 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:31.849
 are things that I'm actually funny 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.620
 think because they take the whole thing 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:36.019
 bit by bit they play with the 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.370
 bad reputation of the simulator chance 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.989
 and sometimes it's like last year 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.900
 in the case of search and simulated too 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:44.030
 small playful jewels of this 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.290
 therefore , a trend that I'm quite cool 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.970
 I'm curious where that still 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.040
 the straight highest thing leads the 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.810
 steam early access or green light or 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.400
 also pixar there one comes in the future 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.540
 maybe even more in the enjoyment of 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:04:00.099
 so nonsense 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:04:00.099
 and I always find it in second place 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.420
 that was kind of like a short one 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.400
 moments of this year switch place 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.070
 Pokemon was the perfect one for me 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.200
 melange from any one had in the 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:15.410
 completely absurd idea and all join in 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.780
 and for me that was a great example 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:20.190
 the boredom the whole gamer community 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.380
 can weld together and what is right 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:26.100
 east is to come out of it 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:28.410
 Replays Pokemon was trying thousands 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.270
 Streamer and participant a game 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.740
 to let play what has led to it 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.090
 that all somehow in different 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.430
 Everyone wanted to run directions 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.570
 could access the service 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.430
 Of course the main character is sometimes called 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.810
 not more than hours in a circle 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.430
 shot at each other in another 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.590
 direction but has the game 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.660
 was actually played through and so 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:47.340
 then has mimicking too 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:49.020
 Among other things, you could draw two 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.730
 observe fish as they are in 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.490
 street fighter on the maul have given 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:55.440
 and later, place was still joining 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.240
 all sorts of other pokÃ©mon games 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.520
 played through very very cool idea the 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.650
 shows what all is possible in the still 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.760
 Video area and what we do cool things 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.760
 the people should come too 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:09.740
 place one 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.190
 That was one of the nicest developments 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.780
 in 2014 for me because I have last 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.460
 year still reason that I was open 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.169
 that all these kickstarter projects 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.090
 The last year were funded then 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:29.590
 hopefully this year something 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.120
 become and not as crap 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.620
 turn out and luckily it was not 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.240
 like most projects over 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:36.789
 kickstarter were funded and this 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.009
 year started really good things started 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:41.860
 had that with broken age or the banner 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:44.080
 sager then went through wasteland two 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.520
 pulled through and ended at one of 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.889
 games that I this year with the still 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:49.630
 The coolest thing was divinity originals 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:51.370
 out that it has been postponed several times 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.990
 and I thought oh god that can 

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:54.580
 but nothing will but it is one 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:57.539
 really great game 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:59.650
 1 that's so bulky and yes somehow too 

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:00.970
 it's probably old-fashioned 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.259
 from a normal publisher never 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:04.870
 would have been published 

00:06:02.259 --> 00:06:06.699
 but on this path over kicks there 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:08.440
 he sold really well i am 

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:10.060
 happy that the originals are winning 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.650
 even a success has become because 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.780
 the thing is fun it is difficult 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.830
 will tie you up for hours and it will 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.990
 shows that even with small 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:18.759
 financial means but a lot of heart 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:21.430
 and passion for such projects 

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:23.199
 and above all thanks to you 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:24.729
 fans who have supported as well 

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:27.580
 That's why I see a bright future 

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:30.610
 crowdfunding on this kickstarter 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:32.050
 platforms to come because that shows 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:32.500
 the players who funded there 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.050
 become 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:36.789
 some of them are really good as well 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.650
 Now you can say something again 

00:06:36.789 --> 00:06:40.719
 Do you consider the coolest trends? 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:43.750
 or do you disagree with my opinion 

00:06:40.719 --> 00:06:45.070
 as if this is not so then see 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:45.699
 maybe tomorrow with us again 

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:48.030
 new video 

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:48.030
 to 10
