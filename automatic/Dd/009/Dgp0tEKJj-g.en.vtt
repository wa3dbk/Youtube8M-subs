okay<00:00:07.290> we're<00:00:07.440> working<00:00:07.529> on<00:00:07.830> the<00:00:07.950> first<00:00:08.130> step<00:00:08.490> of

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
okay we're working on the first step of

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.990 
okay we're working on the first step of
our<00:00:08.970> word<00:00:09.540> guessed<00:00:10.080> game<00:00:10.530> and<00:00:10.830> I've<00:00:11.550> kept<00:00:11.849> my

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
our word guessed game and I've kept my

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.240 
our word guessed game and I've kept my
very<00:00:12.360> simple<00:00:12.900> let's<00:00:13.230> go<00:00:13.740> back<00:00:13.889> and<00:00:14.070> look<00:00:14.130> at

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
very simple let's go back and look at

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.430 
very simple let's go back and look at
the<00:00:14.309> guessing<00:00:14.639> game<00:00:14.670> steps<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.900> first<00:00:16.109> two

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
the guessing game steps the first two

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.840 
the guessing game steps the first two
steps<00:00:16.710> which<00:00:16.949> is<00:00:17.039> what<00:00:17.220> this<00:00:17.369> video<00:00:17.670> is<00:00:17.730> going

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
steps which is what this video is going

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.359 
steps which is what this video is going
to<00:00:18.060> show<00:00:18.270> is<00:00:18.630> to<00:00:18.960> create<00:00:19.320> an<00:00:19.470> array<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:20.100> hold

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
to show is to create an array to hold

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.759 
to show is to create an array to hold
the<00:00:20.580> potential<00:00:20.880> answers<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:21.869> then<00:00:22.289> generate

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
the potential answers and then generate

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.859 
the potential answers and then generate
a<00:00:22.800> random<00:00:23.070> number<00:00:23.369> to<00:00:24.029> pick<00:00:24.180> a<00:00:24.210> word<00:00:24.449> from<00:00:24.720> the

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
a random number to pick a word from the

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:31.490 
a random number to pick a word from the
array<00:00:27.949> so<00:00:28.949> we've<00:00:29.099> declared<00:00:29.880> an<00:00:30.359> array<00:00:30.960> by

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
array so we've declared an array by

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.160 
array so we've declared an array by
declaring<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.160> variable<00:00:32.189> game<00:00:32.910> equal<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.899> and

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
declaring the variable game equal to and

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.080 
declaring the variable game equal to and
in<00:00:34.320> square<00:00:34.620> brackets<00:00:35.010> we<00:00:35.130> have<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.399> values<00:00:35.850> of

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
in square brackets we have the values of

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.250 
in square brackets we have the values of
the<00:00:36.360> array<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:36.960> this<00:00:37.500> would<00:00:37.680> be<00:00:37.829> at<00:00:38.070> index<00:00:38.460> 0

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
the array and this would be at index 0

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.850 
the array and this would be at index 0
index<00:00:40.260> 1<00:00:40.710> index<00:00:41.670> 2<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.300> index<00:00:42.780> 3<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.649> I've

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
index 1 index 2 and index 3 and I've

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.979 
index 1 index 2 and index 3 and I've
sort<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.160> simplified<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.940> formula<00:00:45.510> here<00:00:45.840> for

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
sort of simplified the formula here for

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.430 
sort of simplified the formula here for
the<00:00:46.410> random<00:00:46.770> number<00:00:47.190> because<00:00:47.969> with<00:00:48.840> math<00:00:49.140> dot

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
the random number because with math dot

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.220 
the random number because with math dot
floor<00:00:49.770> we're<00:00:49.980> going<00:00:50.190> to<00:00:50.370> round<00:00:50.610> down<00:00:51.020> we<00:00:52.020> want

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
floor we're going to round down we want

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.270 
floor we're going to round down we want
a<00:00:52.289> number<00:00:52.500> between<00:00:52.739> 0<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:54.170> 3<00:00:55.170> in<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.500> formula

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
a number between 0 and 3 in the formula

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.939 
a number between 0 and 3 in the formula
that<00:00:57.120> we're<00:00:57.270> supposed<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.780> use<00:00:58.050> for<00:00:58.079> this<00:00:58.410> is

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
that we're supposed to use for this is

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.900 
that we're supposed to use for this is
math<00:00:59.309> dot<00:00:59.609> random<00:00:59.989> times<00:01:01.010> the<00:01:02.010> max<00:01:02.340> minus<00:01:02.879> the

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
math dot random times the max minus the

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.580 
math dot random times the max minus the
minimum<00:01:03.210> which<00:01:03.780> would<00:01:03.930> be<00:01:04.049> 3<00:01:04.619> minus<00:01:05.309> 0<00:01:05.810> plus<00:01:06.810> 1

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
minimum which would be 3 minus 0 plus 1

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.520 
minimum which would be 3 minus 0 plus 1
so<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.340> would<00:01:08.460> be<00:01:08.640> 4<00:01:09.000> so<00:01:09.240> we<00:01:09.360> have

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
so that would be 4 so we have

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.980 
so that would be 4 so we have
math.random<00:01:10.530> times<00:01:11.400> 4<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.210> that's<00:01:12.780> supposed

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
math.random times 4 and that's supposed

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.810 
math.random times 4 and that's supposed
to<00:01:13.200> be<00:01:13.290> plus<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.590> minimum<00:01:13.860> which<00:01:14.220> is<00:01:14.369> 0<00:01:14.580> so<00:01:14.790> we

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
to be plus the minimum which is 0 so we

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.130 
to be plus the minimum which is 0 so we
can<00:01:14.909> ignore<00:01:15.299> it<00:01:15.479> so<00:01:15.689> we're<00:01:15.840> getting<00:01:15.930> the

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
can ignore it so we're getting the

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.370 
can ignore it so we're getting the
random<00:01:16.860> numbers<00:01:17.220> between<00:01:17.580> 0<00:01:18.180> &amp;<00:01:18.420> 3<00:01:18.750> because<00:01:18.930> if

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
random numbers between 0 &amp; 3 because if

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.380 
random numbers between 0 &amp; 3 because if
the<00:01:19.680> top<00:01:19.890> number<00:01:20.280> is<00:01:20.310> 4<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:20.880> we<00:01:20.970> round<00:01:21.240> down

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
the top number is 4 and we round down

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.670 
the top number is 4 and we round down
we'll<00:01:22.140> only<00:01:22.290> get<00:01:22.470> 0<00:01:22.890> to<00:01:23.430> 3<00:01:23.790> giving<00:01:24.330> us<00:01:24.450> 0<00:01:24.810> 1<00:01:25.140> 2<00:01:25.500> or

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
we'll only get 0 to 3 giving us 0 1 2 or

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.230 
we'll only get 0 to 3 giving us 0 1 2 or
3<00:01:26.119> then<00:01:27.119> we're<00:01:27.330> storing<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.810> answer<00:01:28.470> in<00:01:29.310> game

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
3 then we're storing the answer in game

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.899 
3 then we're storing the answer in game
at<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.659> index<00:01:30.960> of<00:01:31.140> choice<00:01:31.409> so<00:01:31.740> game<00:01:32.159> is<00:01:32.430> our

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
at the index of choice so game is our

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.980 
at the index of choice so game is our
array<00:01:33.810> choice<00:01:34.680> is<00:01:34.950> our<00:01:35.220> index<00:01:35.970> and<00:01:36.299> then<00:01:36.780> I'm

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
array choice is our index and then I'm

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.969 
array choice is our index and then I'm
staring<00:01:37.439> staring<00:01:37.890> storing<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.850> length<00:01:39.150> of

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
staring staring storing the length of

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.649 
staring staring storing the length of
answer<00:01:40.979> and<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.490> variable<00:01:41.850> called<00:01:42.090> my<00:01:42.390> length

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
answer and a variable called my length

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.120 
answer and a variable called my length
which<00:01:43.020> we're<00:01:43.170> going<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.350> use<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.530> lot<00:01:43.770> coming<00:01:43.979> up

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
which we're going to use a lot coming up

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.380 
which we're going to use a lot coming up
it's<00:01:44.280> not<00:01:44.369> really<00:01:44.610> important<00:01:45.030> right<00:01:45.149> now

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
it's not really important right now

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.760 
it's not really important right now
but<00:01:45.899> we're<00:01:46.020> gonna<00:01:46.140> need<00:01:46.229> that<00:01:46.560> through

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
but we're gonna need that through

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.789 
but we're gonna need that through
several<00:01:47.070> upcoming<00:01:47.790> steps<00:01:48.290> so<00:01:49.290> let's<00:01:49.470> flip<00:01:49.619> it

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
several upcoming steps so let's flip it

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.130 
several upcoming steps so let's flip it
back<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.189> forth<00:01:50.340> from<00:01:50.399> being<00:01:50.640> on<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.270> you'll

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
back and forth from being on and you'll

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.770 
back and forth from being on and you'll
see<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.590> believe<00:01:52.860> in<00:01:53.460> testing<00:01:53.700> at<00:01:54.090> every<00:01:54.420> step

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
see I believe in testing at every step

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.770 
see I believe in testing at every step
so<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.320> first<00:01:55.530> time<00:01:55.710> we<00:01:55.799> run<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:56.070> we<00:01:56.299> get<00:01:57.299> April

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
so the first time we run it we get April

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.390 
so the first time we run it we get April
January

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:10.480 

February

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.700 

January<00:02:11.360> so<00:02:11.750> we<00:02:11.840> are<00:02:11.960> generating<00:02:12.110> a<00:02:12.560> random

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
January so we are generating a random

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.500 
January so we are generating a random
number<00:02:13.100> each<00:02:13.430> time<00:02:13.730> if<00:02:13.880> we<00:02:13.970> kept<00:02:14.120> going<00:02:14.150> would

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
number each time if we kept going would

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.240 
number each time if we kept going would
eventually<00:02:14.720> get<00:02:14.990> all<00:02:15.140> of<00:02:15.320> them<00:02:15.470> but<00:02:16.040> it's<00:02:16.160> a

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
eventually get all of them but it's a

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.430 
eventually get all of them but it's a
randomly<00:02:16.700> generated<00:02:17.210> each<00:02:17.360> time<00:02:17.390> so<00:02:18.320> we're

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
randomly generated each time so we're

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.190 
randomly generated each time so we're
off<00:02:18.560> to<00:02:18.590> where<00:02:19.010> we<00:02:19.160> need<00:02:19.340> to<00:02:19.460> start<00:02:19.700> we're<00:02:20.200> we

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
off to where we need to start we're we

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.290 
off to where we need to start we're we
have<00:02:21.230> an<00:02:21.440> array<00:02:21.710> of<00:02:21.740> possible<00:02:22.550> answers<00:02:23.060> and

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
have an array of possible answers and

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.270 
have an array of possible answers and
we're<00:02:23.780> randomly<00:02:24.260> picking<00:02:24.560> one<00:02:24.830> which

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
we're randomly picking one which

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.280 
we're randomly picking one which
restoring<00:02:25.850> in<00:02:25.940> choice<00:02:26.210> and<00:02:26.540> then<00:02:26.990> we're<00:02:27.110> going

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
restoring in choice and then we're going

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.620 
restoring in choice and then we're going
to<00:02:27.440> get<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.650> length<00:02:27.980> of<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.970> answer<00:02:29.360> which

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
to get the length of the answer which

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.270 
to get the length of the answer which
we'll<00:02:29.810> need<00:02:29.840> in<00:02:30.080> a<00:02:30.170> few<00:02:30.410> minutes<00:02:30.770> so<00:02:31.130> that's

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
we'll need in a few minutes so that's

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.560 
we'll need in a few minutes so that's
the<00:02:31.520> first<00:02:31.910> step<00:02:32.450> in<00:02:32.690> the<00:02:32.840> word<00:02:32.990> guessed<00:02:33.290> game
