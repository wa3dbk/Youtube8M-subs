00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.640
 then we warm the back side 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.660
 one part we were 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.380

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:42.690

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:51.330

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:47.989
 cross we remove two cups we start 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:52.290
 we started supplying one cup here and 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:53.040
 we insert stop and then we do the second 7 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:58.620
 neatly 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:02.580
 thank you 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:06.630
 I forget to lock because it was there 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:10.350
 accordingly as it was marked 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:15.989
 it is a strong note put one cup 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:19.709
 instead parrying the stopper should come in by 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:21.460
 the whole diameter is a lot of download 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.870
 saved 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:26.080
 after that will not be so part on 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:31.440
 figure out on the go came insert 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:34.870
 second cup 2 put a cup 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:38.590
 when he left 2 stoppers crosses 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:40.800
 should enter smoothly without jamming low 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:46.380
 forest some jangling means we 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:51.960
 the wolf fell for a long time she will not serve 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:04:00.510
 In this state, we insert the second plug 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:04:04.020
 just remove the city nenko cups with 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.020
 one and the other 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:14.860
 but you wrote down another cup 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:21.510
 left one cup to put and check 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:21.510
 but constantly perry pressed 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:32.110
 checking right down i mean all works 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:37.200
 without jamming means everything is right 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:39.870
 collected can be drawn 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:45.090
 The principle of technology is suitable for any 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:45.090
 Tordana and all
