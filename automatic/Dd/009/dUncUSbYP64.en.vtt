00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:09.690
 today we make a special recipe the 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:13.670
 not rice with cuttlefish ink 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.670
 we start from the onion a half onion 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:26.010
 we peel finally attack here 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:30.000
 here another of the da tina a nice ride 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:33.500
 of oil and put our onions 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.010
 let's take the non-rice or a potato 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.010
 to peel 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:54.450
 be careful that the onion though 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:58.510
 jolie without burning we lower the fire 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:03.400
 and the far away I love here in the meantime 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:13.860
 we prepare our potatoes we make 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:21.160
 rather thin slices and then 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:24.729
 we make sticks and this must 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:31.660
 be dimension as if it were a 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:35.130
 slightly larger rice grain le 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:37.600
 our potatoes or no rice is ready 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.190
 we return to the fire 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.740
 our onion and veteranos 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.590
 has already become practically already 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:51.549
 cloudy and let's add our own 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:57.430
 I don't rice they turn in such a way that you 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:59.049
 can flavor with oil now 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.640
 of course this is not rice with 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.440
 he must toast so now we can 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.680
 continue our culture 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:09.720
 normally then adding some broth 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.720
 of fish so 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:23.300
 we can raise the fire and go to 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.650
 work our sepia in this case 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.630
 where we will do an extremely cooking 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.420
 quick then we will cut them to 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:36.160
 these very very thin strips 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:36.160
 let's say the dimensions of our 7 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.570
 as it is becoming this way 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.050
 excessively place continues from 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.050
 this other part 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:06.069
 our know is ready as you see 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:08.079
 all very thinly sliced that 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:12.390
 it means one minute 2 minutes of cooking 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:12.390
 at most we control our potatoes 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:19.209
 and I would say that we can also add the 

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:21.120
 cuttlefish ink that we dissolved in a 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:31.390
 little hot water 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:34.000
 that's the effect our potatoes are at 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:38.349
 good point I would say this point we can 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:44.530
 add the cuttlefish they must take 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:46.359
 and little more than fabulous heat you see 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.939
 as the color of the is already changing 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:52.060
 sepe went from being translucent to 

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:56.079
 white so no we can at this point 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:04:01.650
 push fire and let's go to shoot the 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:01.650
 our not rice a bit of parsley 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:12.930
 here is some of our price is 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:15.860
 moroso and this is our non rice is 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.860
 cuttlefish black
