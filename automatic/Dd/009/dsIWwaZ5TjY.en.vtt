right there and like I'm saying the only
thing<00:01:40.570> I<00:01:40.690> can<00:01:40.869> figure<00:01:41.080> out<00:01:41.170> after<00:01:41.800> all<00:01:41.950> these

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160 
thing I can figure out after all these

seeing all these fish take that bait

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.230 
seeing all these fish take that bait
like<00:01:46.690> that<00:01:46.929> is<00:01:47.170> that<00:01:47.979> they<00:01:48.160> are<00:01:48.340> so<00:01:48.580> completely

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
like that is that they are so completely

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.950 
like that is that they are so completely
fooled<00:01:49.920> by<00:01:50.920> that<00:01:50.950> bait<00:01:51.490> it<00:01:51.759> feels<00:01:52.179> so<00:01:52.479> good<00:01:52.750> to

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
fooled by that bait it feels so good to

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.380 
fooled by that bait it feels so good to
them<00:01:53.170> when<00:01:54.039> they<00:01:54.190> get<00:01:54.369> close<00:01:54.610> to<00:01:54.640> it<00:01:54.850> and<00:01:55.119> their

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
them when they get close to it and their

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.139 
them when they get close to it and their
lateral<00:01:55.869> line<00:01:56.080> kicks<00:01:56.470> in<00:01:56.710> and<00:01:57.090> instead<00:01:58.090> of

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149 
lateral line kicks in and instead of

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:01.109 
lateral line kicks in and instead of
vision<00:01:58.720> that<00:01:59.250> final<00:02:00.250> that's<00:02:00.550> I<00:02:00.759> think<00:02:01.000> the

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
vision that final that's I think the

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.200 
vision that final that's I think the
final<00:02:01.390> sense<00:02:02.310> that<00:02:03.310> makes<00:02:03.550> them<00:02:03.789> take<00:02:04.000> that

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
final sense that makes them take that

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.899 
final sense that makes them take that

now<00:02:34.959> the<00:02:35.019> cool<00:02:35.260> thing<00:02:35.290> about<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:36.100> swim<00:02:36.340> baits

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:36.579 
now the cool thing about the swim baits

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:38.520 
now the cool thing about the swim baits
is<00:02:36.850> not<00:02:37.000> only<00:02:37.180> are<00:02:37.540> they<00:02:37.690> so<00:02:37.720> appealing<00:02:38.410> to

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
is not only are they so appealing to

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.949 
is not only are they so appealing to
fish<00:02:38.739> but<00:02:39.040> they're<00:02:39.489> easy<00:02:39.700> to<00:02:39.910> fish<00:02:40.150> because<00:02:40.360> if

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
fish but they're easy to fish because if

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.690 
fish but they're easy to fish because if
you<00:02:41.079> just<00:02:41.260> think<00:02:41.320> about<00:02:41.530> a<00:02:41.709> message<00:02:42.040> as<00:02:42.190> being

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
you just think about a message as being

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:43.949 
you just think about a message as being
a<00:02:42.790> crankbait<00:02:43.150> a<00:02:43.450> different<00:02:43.750> kind<00:02:43.930> of

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
a crankbait a different kind of

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.479 
a crankbait a different kind of
crankbait<00:02:44.440> because<00:02:44.709> you<00:02:44.799> want<00:02:45.010> to<00:02:45.100> move<00:02:45.250> them

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
crankbait because you want to move them

just<00:02:48.820> interrupt<00:02:49.269> the<00:02:49.390> retrieve<00:02:49.810> just<00:02:50.079> a

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
just interrupt the retrieve just a

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.259 
just interrupt the retrieve just a
little<00:02:50.440> bit<00:02:50.590> and<00:02:50.859> then<00:02:51.190> move<00:02:51.549> it<00:02:51.700> along<00:02:51.790> again

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
little bit and then move it along again

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.330 
little bit and then move it along again

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
baits just about like everything is that

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.890 
baits just about like everything is that
the<00:02:57.190> first<00:02:57.430> most<00:02:57.910> important<00:02:58.390> thing<00:02:58.540> is<00:02:58.690> depth

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
the first most important thing is depth

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.449 
the first most important thing is depth
control<00:02:59.140> so<00:02:59.590> that's<00:02:59.769> why<00:02:59.920> you<00:02:59.980> got<00:03:00.190> the<00:03:00.220> choice

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
control so that's why you got the choice

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.099 
control so that's why you got the choice
between<00:03:00.670> the<00:03:00.880> five<00:03:01.060> inch<00:03:01.269> or<00:03:01.420> the<00:03:01.450> six<00:03:01.750> inch<00:03:01.930> or

between the five inch or the six inch or
you<00:03:03.070> know<00:03:03.160> six<00:03:03.370> inch<00:03:03.549> will<00:03:03.700> get<00:03:03.820> you<00:03:03.910> a<00:03:03.970> little

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
you know six inch will get you a little

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.330 
you know six inch will get you a little
bit<00:03:04.239> deeper<00:03:04.420> then<00:03:05.140> down<00:03:05.320> into<00:03:05.530> about<00:03:05.739> 15<00:03:06.160> feet

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
bit deeper then down into about 15 feet

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.280 
bit deeper then down into about 15 feet
of<00:03:06.489> water<00:03:06.519> you<00:03:06.820> can<00:03:06.970> fish<00:03:07.150> that<00:03:07.390> you<00:03:07.780> can<00:03:07.930> push

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
of water you can fish that you can push

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:09.740 
of water you can fish that you can push
it<00:03:08.470> and<00:03:08.560> get<00:03:08.680> it<00:03:08.799> down<00:03:08.920> into<00:03:09.160> 20

it and get it down into 20

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.620 
it and get it down into 20
but<00:03:10.350> again<00:03:10.860> it's<00:03:11.040> just<00:03:11.190> move<00:03:11.370> it<00:03:11.520> along<00:03:11.610> let<00:03:12.510> it

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
but again it's just move it along let it

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.720 
but again it's just move it along let it
show<00:03:12.870> its<00:03:13.020> best<00:03:13.320> attributes<00:03:13.980> its<00:03:14.280> wobbling

begin<00:03:18.150> just<00:03:18.420> begin<00:03:18.720> to<00:03:18.810> track<00:03:19.080> if<00:03:19.260> they'll<00:03:19.440> get

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
begin just begin to track if they'll get

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.710 
begin just begin to track if they'll get
on<00:03:19.740> it<00:03:19.890> they<00:03:20.040> will<00:03:20.430> not<00:03:20.730> only<00:03:20.880> see<00:03:21.210> it<00:03:21.240> first<00:03:21.570> of

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
on it they will not only see it first of

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.120 
on it they will not only see it first of
all<00:03:21.840> but<00:03:22.050> then<00:03:22.170> they<00:03:22.290> begin<00:03:22.530> to<00:03:22.650> track<00:03:22.890> it<00:03:23.070> and

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
all but then they begin to track it and

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.190 
all but then they begin to track it and
they<00:03:23.220> feel<00:03:23.460> it<00:03:23.490> and<00:03:23.790> at<00:03:24.270> the<00:03:24.300> last<00:03:24.540> instance

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200

they feel it and at the last instance
it's<00:03:25.410> that<00:03:25.590> feeling<00:03:26.070> along<00:03:26.280> the<00:03:26.430> lateral<00:03:26.820> line

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
it's that feeling along the lateral line

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
it's that feeling along the lateral line
that<00:03:27.330> triggers<00:03:27.660> those<00:03:27.810> fish<00:03:32.780> that's<00:03:33.780> a<00:03:33.900> pretty
