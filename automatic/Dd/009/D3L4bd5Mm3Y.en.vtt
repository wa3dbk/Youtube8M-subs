00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:08.880
 in the netherlands we have more and more chances 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.580
 on flooding because of the river 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.250
 space loses the rivers 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.199
 sandwiched between ever higher dikes and 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.420
 at the same time the bottom is behind the 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.980
 dikes have fallen 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.380
 Moreover, it rains more often and harder 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.010
 which means that the rivers need more water 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.010
 processing 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.269
 that's why the government has the program 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.910
 space for the river developed on lake 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.300
 then 30 places along rhine ijssel 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.340
 wow the Rhine and we leave the water 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.719
 flow more freely 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.730
 one of these places is the area 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.890
 munnikenland 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.750
 the munnikenland is a beautiful part 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.790
 river land between the ball and the 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.680
 dammed mesh and lies in the most 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.030
 western tip of the province 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.579
 gelderland 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.739
 also special about that water culture 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.690
 agriculture and nature 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:02.610
 here for centuries and scenic 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:04.379
 mosaic shapes for the safety of 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.450
 residents in the area behind 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.740
 find important changes here 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.900
 Place 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.790
 this way the existing dyke becomes inland 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.380
 shifted and become the floodplain 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.910
 reduced 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.350
 then the existing embankment can 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:21.710
 largely be excavated 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.689
 the project leads to two effects 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.630
 firstly, a larger discharge capacity 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:28.640
 from the river at high tide 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.119
 with this a water level drops 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.040
 11 centimeters at high water 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:36.799
 The second effect is that we have three four 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.440
 give more influence to the formation of it 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.750
 munnikenland 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.210
 an attractive area is being created with 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:47.340
 natural transitions between river 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.340
 creeks of the bank and the bowl 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.890
 the new so-called 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:57.000
 wakkerendijk is a dyke of the 21st century 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.000
 this dyke is multifunctional 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.960
 safety is paramount at the same time 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.720
 offers the dike seats for visitors 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.540
 and recreationists a kind of grandstand with a 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.320
 beautiful view of the area 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.360
 also the dike and 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.390
 high water refuge places for cattle 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.920
 horses and other animals 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.610
 with a rise in the water in the 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.470
 area offers the dike and a safe place 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.630
 for a natural look 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.340
 we are planting the dike with trees around this 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:28.090
 all possible is the dike 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.830
 made extra wide and high 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.660
 also the spatial quality of it 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.580
 area is being improved 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.680
 That means that the Munnikenland still 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.890
 is made more beautiful by the present 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.990
 nature and culture and better 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.840
 to make it possible for recreational users and 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.310
 visitor due to the greater influence of the 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.870
 river on the landscape 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.390
 a variety arises 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.739
 new nature with reeds in the 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.780
 lower parts 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.600
 natural grass and meadows on the 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.810
 higher parts and so-called softwood 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.489
 ooibos to experience the area itself and 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.040
 be experienced for visitors and 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:06.310
 recreational bike walk and various 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.260
 Struin routes laid out a number 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.660
 places in the area is special or 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.160
 has cultural-historical value 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.680
 think for example of the beautiful castle 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.780
 by implementing this 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.760
 project will receive a final one 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.470
 raised access road and becomes the 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.660
 outer moat again in honor 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.310
 restored 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.970
 You will also find the former castle here 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:31.010
 location het regthuys 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.010
 and former monastery monk court 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.700
 this important cultural-historical 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:37.890
 places get a visible place again 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.790
 in the area we do that through this 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.040
 locations 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.830
 raise slightly and with planting 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.140
 mark in the terrain 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.670
 this project of water board river country 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.680
 contributes to the protection of 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.410
 residents in the river area 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.270
 flooding 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.100
 In addition, holidaymakers and visitors can 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.480
 enjoy the newly formed 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.310
 landscape 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:03.320
 the project is part of the government 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.320
 program space for the river
