00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
novak hv pro i'm running 32 p gearing on

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.000 
novak hv pro i'm running 32 p gearing on
it<00:00:14.969> at<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.150> moment<00:00:15.379> had<00:00:16.379> to<00:00:16.500> do<00:00:16.619> a<00:00:16.650> couple<00:00:16.920> of

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
it at the moment had to do a couple of

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.640 
it at the moment had to do a couple of
configurations<00:00:17.609> for<00:00:17.760> that<00:00:18.199> you<00:00:19.199> can<00:00:19.350> see<00:00:19.529> the

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
configurations for that you can see the

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.429 
configurations for that you can see the
gearing<00:00:19.890> there<00:00:20.570> also<00:00:21.570> i'm<00:00:21.660> only<00:00:21.810> running<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:22.199> 3

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
gearing there also i'm only running a 3

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.200 
gearing there also i'm only running a 3
cell<00:00:22.680> lipo<00:00:22.890> at<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.250> moment<00:00:23.580> instead<00:00:23.760> of<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:23.939> 4

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
cell lipo at the moment instead of a 4

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.179 
cell lipo at the moment instead of a 4
cell<00:00:24.449> lipo<00:00:24.689> which<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.350> motor<00:00:25.560> can<00:00:25.769> handle

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
cell lipo which the motor can handle

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.130 
cell lipo which the motor can handle
it's<00:00:26.970> only<00:00:27.119> because<00:00:27.269> i<00:00:27.420> haven't<00:00:27.539> got<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.750> 4<00:00:27.960> cell

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
it's only because i haven't got a 4 cell

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.310 
it's only because i haven't got a 4 cell
lipo<00:00:28.289> that<00:00:28.590> will<00:00:28.710> fit<00:00:29.029> so<00:00:30.029> yeah<00:00:30.840> let<00:00:31.080> me<00:00:31.170> show

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.630 

I'm<00:01:41.380> sure<00:01:41.590> you<00:01:41.680> can<00:01:41.770> imagine<00:01:41.860> driving<00:01:42.370> with

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
I'm sure you can imagine driving with

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.830 
I'm sure you can imagine driving with
one<00:01:42.760> hand<00:01:42.820> and<00:01:43.180> trying<00:01:43.390> to<00:01:43.450> film<00:01:43.630> with<00:01:43.720> the

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
one hand and trying to film with the

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.530 
one hand and trying to film with the
other<00:01:43.930> is<00:01:44.110> not<00:01:44.260> easy<00:01:44.470> I<00:01:45.000> can't<00:01:46.000> even<00:01:46.060> go<00:01:46.270> full

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
other is not easy I can't even go full

00:01:46.540 --> 00:02:37.420 
other is not easy I can't even go full
speed<00:01:47.320> on<00:01:47.560> it<00:01:55.080> hope<00:01:56.080> the<00:01:56.320> aerials<00:01:56.620> come<00:01:56.800> on

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.770 

pretty<00:02:38.430> much<00:02:38.550> contact<00:02:38.940> open<00:02:39.270> full<00:02:39.450> throttle

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
pretty much contact open full throttle

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.540 
pretty much contact open full throttle
yeah<00:02:39.900> just<00:02:40.170> go<00:02:40.290> slowly<00:02:40.620> and<00:02:40.800> then<00:02:40.920> accelerate

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
yeah just go slowly and then accelerate

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:49.160 
yeah just go slowly and then accelerate
up<00:02:46.490> so<00:02:47.490> all<00:02:48.210> of<00:02:48.240> this<00:02:48.480> run<00:02:48.690> i<00:02:48.720> haven't<00:02:49.050> had<00:02:49.110> a

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
up so all of this run i haven't had a

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:56.990 
up so all of this run i haven't had a
chance<00:02:49.230> to<00:02:49.530> hit<00:02:49.890> full<00:02:50.100> throttle<00:02:50.460> yet<00:02:56.000> that's

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
chance to hit full throttle yet that's

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:08.480 
chance to hit full throttle yet that's
about<00:02:57.210> 75%<00:02:57.840> throttle<00:03:00.500> 50<00:03:05.600> G's<00:03:07.220> gonna<00:03:08.220> hit<00:03:08.340> that

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
about 75% throttle 50 G's gonna hit that

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:16.760 
about 75% throttle 50 G's gonna hit that
deer

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770

you guys get the idea or anyway she's
very<00:03:44.480> very<00:03:45.019> fast<00:03:46.480> simply<00:03:47.480> I<00:03:47.569> get<00:03:47.690> a<00:03:47.720> speed<00:03:48.080> gun

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
very very fast simply I get a speed gun

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.449 
very very fast simply I get a speed gun
or<00:03:48.470> something<00:03:48.500> like<00:03:48.769> that<00:03:48.830> I'll<00:03:49.130> get<00:03:49.340> an

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
or something like that I'll get an

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:50.890 
or something like that I'll get an
official<00:03:49.730> speed<00:03:50.120> test<00:03:50.420> and<00:03:50.660> we'll<00:03:50.720> go<00:03:50.870> from

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
official speed test and we'll go from

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:57.549 
official speed test and we'll go from
there<00:03:51.340> come<00:03:52.340> until<00:03:52.580> then<00:03:54.340> beat<00:03:55.340> that
