00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 Hello dear friends with you game 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.600
 captive and the first game is called free 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.340
 historic is very high quality 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.160
 cool platformer which we are now 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.200
 let's see so we get to stone 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.780
 century and play for some cool 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.760
 character who runs to perform 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.039
 different missions and most importantly 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.439
 the game in Russian is true translation 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.570
 A bit of some industrial but in the game 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.369
 I saw a lot of humor 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.680
 some rat rams which 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.980
 lay snails and which we need 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.930
 cut down and here flew our fly which 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.899
 will always fly after us give us 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.239
 advice telling what and how to do and 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.940
 so on in general in this see for yourself and 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.340
 so how to stay managing management 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.039
 communication with the two buttons left and 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.280
 to the right of using the jump button with 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:53.399
 using the button hit with a baton but this 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.100
 already seen and there is still a growl button but 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.980
 for some reason it does not work yet from will 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.210
 work a little later so in the bushes 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.120
 hiding exceptionism 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.450
 and now you see what he does and he 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:10.560
 as all their huddle ground plow open 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:13.229
 your how to say cry and show all your 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.090
 advantages and disadvantages of the game are very 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.310
 a lot of humor so this platformer 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.799
 very cool besides that he possesses 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.950
 good enough and good 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:25.590
 the graphics therefore recommend it to everyone 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.409
 Available at amazon appstore and 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.720
 you can download from there though he is there 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.790
 paid but I think I will not 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.100
 promote piracy you yourself all 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.350
 know what android games can be 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.600
 download and not only from official 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.990
 sources the second game is called 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.630
 zombie jigsaw puzzles 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.439
 stylized puzzle 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.020
 zombie apocalypse what we need to do 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:51.899
 we have here such playing fields 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.939
 not always different and we need here in 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.920
 such a perimeter surround zombies 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.880
 the same characters let's say 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.590
 try to do this with the help of the military 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:06.300
 replace the military's the public that 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:09.300
 the bank having fallen punk rebels and thereby 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:12.990
 surrounding them we jongs destroy it 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.410
 some kind of loyalty stylization 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.680
 under 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.540
 Country in a row something but still 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.600
 the idea is very original and interesting 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.700
 made the transition between levels that is 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.770
 we move around the city we fall into 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.650
 the following areas here here are 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.230
 There are various ward prikolyukha 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.450
 do not give bored and the essence of our in 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.280
 to destroy all the zombies further zombies 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.220
 will begin to multiply if we are too 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.770
 think long and thus complicate 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.610
 us a game and maybe that moment will come 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:46.470
 when we just can't even get through 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.840
 a certain mission of marks is enough 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.490
 original interesting puzzle 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.430
 despite the fact that she is about zombies 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:56.790
 But about zombies, everyone is already fed up with the game, but this 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.760
 stands out and causes interest therefore 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.160
 I advise everyone to read it even 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.170
 if you didnâ€™t like the third one 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.940
 the game is called magic defense you are defense 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.250
 in which we will need not only 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.970
 Tap but your own even now you are in it 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.620
 make sure 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.200
 really probably such a management 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.840
 somewhat uncomfortable and but makes you 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.760
 sweat and not get bored now you 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.760
 actually see for yourself we play for 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:24.050
 wizards and we need for it 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.870
 shoot the same way we can still cause 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:31.130
 the spell is needed like this 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:33.030
 hold your finger and then connect 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.970
 let's connect already 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.800
 but despite the fact that I already played why 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.860
 it will be necessary even here it will be a 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.630
 since it is learning and so 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.970
 it is necessary here with such svaypami 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.489
 shoot all over the undead which will 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:51.000
 step on you and thereby protect 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:53.610
 its own fortress its tower from all 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.090
 here are some of these deaths bevels 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:00.330
 skeletons with swords and lots of others 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:03.720
 characters who will offend you 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.580
 just crazy bodies and so besides 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.900
 here are the spells that are seen here 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.800
 there are other spells to their 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.370
 exercise is necessary just 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.830
 differently hold your finger and so 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.459
 let's call this menu again and 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:19.709
 to rule 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.780
 he is such a spell thanks 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:25.080
 such a spell falls meteorite and 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:28.560
 kills all the zombies you are exactly skeletons 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:32.009
 who surrounded you and took you by surprise 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.449
 In principle, a good defense but that's all 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:36.840
 here and so let your sometimes 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:37.699
 annoying worn finger and starts 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.440
 to hurt 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:42.030
 the last screen is logic logic 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.880

 various subjects and enough 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:02.190
 complex and 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:04.020
 with dirty tricks so let's see what 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.720
 some problem for the feast problem with 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:09.680
 dirty tricks one word and so here 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.759
 it is necessary to make up these letters 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:15.960
 certain word but it is not 

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:18.150

 have an average person and 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:24.870
 let's see the answer one day 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:27.780
 birth happens once a year i.e. 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:30.960
 three hundred and sixty five days that is 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:33.570
 think about the meaning of the term birthday in 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.669
 general, some get the result from 

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:38.159
 average person total 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:41.870

 birth is actually one person 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:56.940
 only one birthday in life happens 

00:05:53.909 --> 00:06:00.090
