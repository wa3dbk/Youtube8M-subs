squishiest one from there come but as
you're<00:00:18.300> going<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.539> see<00:00:18.740> the<00:00:19.740> frost<00:00:20.130> DK<00:00:20.520> is

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
you're going to see the frost DK is

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.000 
you're going to see the frost DK is
actually<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.539> best<00:00:21.570> gear<00:00:22.109> from<00:00:22.380> their<00:00:22.769> team

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
actually the best gear from their team

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.279 
actually the best gear from their team
and<00:00:23.250> we<00:00:23.519> we<00:00:24.029> know<00:00:24.180> we're<00:00:24.390> slacking<00:00:24.720> we<00:00:25.019> kind<00:00:25.260> of

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
and we we know we're slacking we kind of

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.500 
and we we know we're slacking we kind of
slacking<00:00:25.529> on<00:00:25.740> gear<00:00:25.980> so<00:00:26.160> we<00:00:26.189> decided<00:00:26.519> switch<00:00:26.820> on

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
slacking on gear so we decided switch on

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.060 
slacking on gear so we decided switch on
the<00:00:27.539> warrior<00:00:27.900> we<00:00:28.019> decide<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.349> go<00:00:28.410> on<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.859> world

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
the warrior we decide to go on the world

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.910 
the warrior we decide to go on the world
because<00:00:29.460> he<00:00:29.910> does<00:00:30.119> seem<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.420> have<00:00:30.720> a<00:00:30.750> lower<00:00:31.380> HP

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
because he does seem to have a lower HP

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.250 
because he does seem to have a lower HP
and<00:00:32.130> that<00:00:32.399> means<00:00:32.640> he's<00:00:32.850> under<00:00:33.180> gear<00:00:33.420> just<00:00:34.110> like

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
and that means he's under gear just like

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.380 
and that means he's under gear just like
us<00:00:34.469> and<00:00:35.340> we're<00:00:35.489> going<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.640> try<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:35.880> get<00:00:36.000> a<00:00:36.059> kill

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
us and we're going to try to get a kill

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.430 
us and we're going to try to get a kill
on<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.750> him<00:00:36.930> so<00:00:37.219> we<00:00:38.219> go<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.370> focus<00:00:38.989> CC<00:00:39.989> the

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
on to him so we go to focus CC the

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.440 
on to him so we go to focus CC the
shamen<00:00:40.890> while<00:00:41.129> putting<00:00:41.399> off<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.610> DK<00:00:42.059> so<00:00:42.270> here

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
shamen while putting off the DK so here

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.910 
shamen while putting off the DK so here
we<00:00:42.540> go<00:00:42.570> you're<00:00:42.870> gonna<00:00:42.960> grip<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.469> warrior<00:00:43.739> it

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
we go you're gonna grip the warrior it

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.590 
we go you're gonna grip the warrior it
just<00:00:44.160> followed<00:00:44.670> by<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.789> blind<00:00:45.000> by<00:00:45.210> me<00:00:45.390> and

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
just followed by a blind by me and

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.389 
just followed by a blind by me and
curious<00:00:46.320> enough<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.710> warrior<00:00:46.950> does<00:00:47.160> shrink

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
curious enough the warrior does shrink

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.889 
curious enough the warrior does shrink
is<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.700> blind<00:00:47.940> which<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.329> kind<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.600> redundant

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
is the blind which is kind of redundant

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.560 
is the blind which is kind of redundant
because<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.289> boat<00:00:49.500> club<00:00:49.770> targeted<00:00:50.309> him<00:00:50.570> then

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
because the boat club targeted him then

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.720 
because the boat club targeted him then
the<00:00:52.020> shamen<00:00:52.350> gets<00:00:52.530> into<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.800> hammer<00:00:53.010> after<00:00:53.550> that

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
the shamen gets into a hammer after that

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.850 
the shamen gets into a hammer after that
a<00:00:53.969> blind<00:00:54.149> he<00:00:54.600> trinkets<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.079> blind<00:00:55.320> gets<00:00:55.620> into

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
a blind he trinkets the blind gets into

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.319 
a blind he trinkets the blind gets into
a<00:00:55.890> pole<00:00:56.160> silence<00:00:56.610> while<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.879> pressure<00:00:57.120> is

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
a pole silence while the pressure is

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.849 
a pole silence while the pressure is
still<00:00:57.510> on<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.690> warrior<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.230> then<00:00:58.500> into<00:00:58.829> a

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
still on the warrior and then into a

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.639 
still on the warrior and then into a
full<00:00:59.190> repentance<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.390> at<00:01:00.780> this<00:01:01.020> time<00:01:01.079> you

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
full repentance and at this time you

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.590 
full repentance and at this time you
already<00:01:01.980> know<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.550> warrior<00:01:02.879> should<00:01:03.180> be<00:01:03.359> dead

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
already know the warrior should be dead

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.840 
already know the warrior should be dead
I<00:01:03.629> mean<00:01:03.930> at<00:01:04.080> full<00:01:04.409> eight<00:01:04.830> second<00:01:05.400> repentance

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
I mean at full eight second repentance

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.810 
I mean at full eight second repentance
is<00:01:06.060> just<00:01:06.330> enough<00:01:07.170> right<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.490> was<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.790> for

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
is just enough right so that was it for

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.850 
is just enough right so that was it for
