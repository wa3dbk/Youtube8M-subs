 i 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.710

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.120
 the rice fell 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.620
 all the time 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.730
 I thought it was a good game for us. 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.700
 people needed the balance of goals and 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.670
 we got in was happy to enter and 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.389
 have made the hay was at the foot of the 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.849
 Philip 

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:16.219
 Then he gave me a release. 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:19.709
 to do half a good half there in the sub-15 

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:22.650
 and vice-scorer of the paulista and now 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:25.200
 Now I came back and I was able to make a good 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.939
 match with the goal of the game in the beginning was 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.430
 very difficult that Oscar was 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:31.919
 pressing us there like us 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.019
 made the first goal and as the third summit 

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:36.719
 further up the stage in the second half to 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:38.849
 people took the ball on the beam but then the 

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:43.260
 We managed to maintain and did according to the 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:47.400
 and GOE according to the following ITU there was 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:49.349
 A friend plays since he 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.280
 I made the table with him and he touched me and 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:52.379
 just off the goalie 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.849
 the bag will be chocolate cuiabá mato 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:59.579
 I came here for Sao Paulo was one of the 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:02.250
 summoned to stay here from under-14 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:05.549
 I'm here in São Paulo, training strong. 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.259
 and I want to be a player in the future 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:08.759
 It's a good first time game of ours. 

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:10.500
 The team had to work harder the ball. 

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:16.049
 control the game in the second half and 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:19.019
 You can already do that and the goals were 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:21.509
 it's always good to score with 11 is and always 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.699
 in the councils helping me so goal was 

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:25.349
 a brunet who gave the band on me or can 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:27.570
 rotate and complete well 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:30.960
 Now let's rest, but without 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:33.389
 concentrated and will return with all good 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.099
 relation to the stage we get what we 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:37.770
 we wanted was to rate at first 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:40.020
 still lacking the general classification 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.479
 we probably know we 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.789
 we are not in the first place overall 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:46.650
 We're going for it. 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:48.479
 We are working in Sao Paulo with 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.460
 every structure that we have then ours 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:52.380
 obligation is to try this first 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.909
 rating that we're doing 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:57.360
 As for today's game we had 

00:04:53.909 --> 00:05:00.300
 enough we had a lot of experience in 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.070
 team is a very offensive team and 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.500
 so I think in the beginning 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:05.850
 a bit of difficulty but it is also a 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.110
 thing that happens 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.150
 It's not overnight that we 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.980
 You can play that way we have 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.870
 that having patience are boys still us 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.880
 we are able to be experiencing 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.130
 a bit more of this phase then this is it 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.470
 that we are trying is terms of 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:21.210
 dates we do not know yet definitive 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.830
 but we know that by the 11th day we 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.380
 then we have a break that the 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.670
 Boys, we're going to be very good. 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.220
 We've been training since January. 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:30.810
 because the cup of brazil competition 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:32.640
 It was to start before we 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.140
 we brought them before né 

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:37.290
 they need this rest they 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:40.050
 need, and are you at home with your parents? 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:43.110
 My grandmother, father, mother, I called you 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:45.180
 It is necessary and when we return, we continue 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:48.090
 training hard to train with determination 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.680
 us in pursuit of this title and 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:51.270
 we can forget about the 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:54.830
 training too and this is what people 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.830
 also worries worry
