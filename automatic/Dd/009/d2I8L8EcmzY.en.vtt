00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 It's personal beauty, the corners are what 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.379
 another video ms 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.760
 and this time I'm going to bring Torino the 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.110
 torino that I had spoken in the video 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.440
 previous 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:21.000
 torino gv 1.150 if I'm not mistaken as 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:25.369
 always call here good beauty and how 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.930
 always right new vehicle that low 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.519
 always played here on this map should test 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.610
 Do you already know this map already played? 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.829
 several times but how do I want to present 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.390
 this car for the first time I wanted 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.370
 get this map here right? 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.079
 not to worry the passenger with 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.820
 Route at last I want to talk 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.910
 specifically his 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.559
 So I decided to bring this map and the map. 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.870
 does not matter much 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.420
 only that should test I use a lot 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.100
 on cars that bass to train the 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.000
 your space 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.329
 the cameras even the camera angles 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.070
 rear view mirrors 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.440
 I like using this map here for 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.619
 then nothing better than to bring 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.630
 a video on it that is interesting 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.619
 so come on let's start at the beginning 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:12.840
 It's a common thing, I want to start. 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.770
 here for his negative points 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.610
 in fact his negative point is not 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.229
 I found no negative points like this. 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.070
 crucial that the issue of return 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.439
 left 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.600
 who already had vehicle play with him 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.790
 will know what I'm talking about is to realize 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.590
 now also the return of the left does not 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.750
 works when you 're looking at challenges 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.340
 you can realize that it only works when you 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.170
 look to the left 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.860
 I look walking and the law works for 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.580
 front not 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:45.190
 It's all the videos I've seen that car. 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.170
 here on the internet are the same 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.800
 problem then I believe it is the 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:54.820
 own vehicle not of the game question 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:57.510
 teaching to put the rear view mirror in full 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:01.840
 those things all 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:04.060
 We already know everyone already knows that 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.680
 It appears that the car is still not 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.640
 I know if you have an update something 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:13.570
 so I've already modified that, right? 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.430
 I hope so because it is something that 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.520
 I'm getting used to the bass 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.350
 This car, not long ago, I'm not 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.000
 accustomed to playing as well as staying 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:26.650
 looking to the left for rearview mirror 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.060
 Left I looking straight here I can 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.370
 view it 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.550
 which greatly facilitates the issue of 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.800
 Display Maneuver Not You 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:41.380
 you're wasting a lot of time and bring more 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:42.700
 for reality, it's ok I'm already 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.860
 getting used to being left 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.070
 To look 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.560
 only it was boring right finally is boring this 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.920
 I see the single single negative point 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:57.130
 car rest for me everything positive the sound 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:03:02.549
 to me it's the strongest point is the sound 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.549
 it is clear also the question 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.400
 his graphic was also very good. 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.780
 worked 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.760
 the panel was very well worked out. 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:14.140
 steering wheel was actually spent time at 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.069
 gearshift went very well 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.019
 worked 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.489
 I really liked the sound of the 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.790
 change of the own exchange of 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:24.840
 march 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:27.489
 I found it very interesting, very well done. 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:31.870
 house that car under the wing 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:36.030
 it is usually very good on cars 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.030
 costs and excellent excellent quality 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:40.920
 so it's really just that you're in the 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.959
 rearview mirror 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.540
 I see disturbs me greatly I'm 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.819
 very annoying with the rear view 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.069
 For me it's a question of the vehicle if 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:54.549
 have a wonderful excellent vehicle 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:57.489
 a reasonable rearview mirror that the car is 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:59.680
 It's horrible, I worry a lot 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:04.750
 rearview is the soul in the face without 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:08.319
 Rearview would be his his direction 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:12.660
 nothing then I'm looking for a lot with this 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:12.660
 teacher quality issue 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.540
 only that I will not need you this 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.620
 vehicle because of this and has many 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.370
 Strong points 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:24.470
 stop playing here want to know 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:27.490
 I'll stop there in front and show you the 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.490
 interior for you 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.930
 look at this brake and it seems that the brake 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:35.330
 other guy type motor on the fourth 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.470
 I am marching throttle gave a 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.639
 braked dir 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.639
 but that reduction in 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:43.610
 one holds that safe noise together right? 

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:48.710
 some vehicles here in the game do not handle 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:52.020
 he dances fucking change dramatically 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:55.620
 the one that holds enough in the spin 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:05:01.139
 This is interesting to be able to 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:08.900
 sidewalk here without wanting to show 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:08.900
 for you guys outta here 

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:18.990
 interior just very well worked 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:22.169
 I prioritize people like this and I really like 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:25.560
 Aesthetic question is also very well 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:28.349
 done is fine and worked 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:31.469
 The modeling was very good, but I 

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:32.520
 I prioritize much more the issue of 

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:36.300
 panel 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:38.999
 Look, look how well-crafted the 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.599
 quality quality padded to 

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:46.229
 floor quality 

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:48.569
 modeling here is seeing the effects of 

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:49.710
 Plated thing has this brightness issue 

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:51.419
 the lighting 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.029
 this really a curve this lighting 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:56.250
 which brings a betrayal curve a question 

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:59.960
 very good aesthetic very cool I 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:03.479
 I really appreciate the panel's aesthetic question. 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:05.129
 much more than the outside question, right? 

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:08.839
 I do not look at the aesthetic question much 

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:11.430
 outside, the question is very much inward 

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:13.349
 looks very much at the interior issue 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.029
 this here mainly panel dashboard is 

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:16.169
 which is fundamental rear view mirrors in 

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:19.319
 first place 

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:23.029
 so this car that brought many 

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:23.029
 qualities many good things 

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:32.960
 interesting really surprised me 

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:39.170
 so it was very very good, it 's another 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:40.790
 thing is I think I spoke because I thought 

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:43.220
 this car classes myself am 

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:45.830
 playing with another car of his 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.450
 is the one from three with only one 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:49.700
 problem on the line if someone has 

00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:52.400
 any question any solution regarding 

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:54.290
 I would love to know why I am not 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:57.410
 getting rec on the wheel with him 

00:06:54.290 --> 00:07:00.850
 It's not taking the keyboard, so I do not know. 

00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:00.850
 if it's to download the beta 

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:05.090
 Anyway, if anyone knows about 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:08.510
 thing about this car of the 

00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:11.360
 rearview mirror and his 23 apache would 

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:13.550
 very happy to know that I only wait 

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:16.280
 who have enjoyed this initial vision 

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:19.370
 I can not speak much more of him. 

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:23.260
 that this is what I saw what I lived 

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:23.260
 it but the two days I downloaded 

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:28.640
 I hope to bring other videos with it will 

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:30.740
 to actually bring him playing really 

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.460
 Finally, the map shows the passenger as if 

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:35.110
 skin 

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:35.110
 This is it, everybody, I hug.
