 he is fourth since it is this year though 

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:11.039
 it is not my thing 

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:14.379
 It would be nice to go with him in his castle 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:16.539
 at absolutely 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:19.539
 when it comes to "It's meant well" 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.339
 the band knew 

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:26.339
 it does not change so much we have a few minutes 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:28.519
 always pretty this right 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:31.519

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.010

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.770

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.859

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.830
 where he belongs 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.830
 behind Inter 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.409
 GÃ¶khan gear stick 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:11.270
 after failing on the steering wheel i was 14 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.940
 in total has 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.660
 right it goes up 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.430
 binding is unnecessary 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.430
 and yet I have at the 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.290
 is that the line that I hope 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.550

 EC Red Bull Salzburg wants the laws 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.970
 is being tested for good 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.590
 who I am, is wonderful 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:42.670
 the judges of the lawsuit 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.550
 the shops 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.939
 the archaeologists come home come barely was when you want 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.290
 good but it is so 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.290
 it was the haz-readers' questions 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.240
 Among other things, the promise to be used 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.690
 brown 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.760
 you have to say about me compared to them 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.490
 would you think that? 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.570
 I should keep that away from me 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.049
 Who's that kind of 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:12.259
 he still wants to control me I can not find it impossible 

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:13.679
 the one in the 70th 

00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:15.420
 he only wants to protect me 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.420

00:02:20.649 --> 00:02:22.519
 I can help myself 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:24.989
 I'm sure of that 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.799
 I can even help everyone 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:28.979
 not to be seen with him are not 

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:31.979
 I'm sure of that 

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:41.629
 Thanks for the offer but unfortunately I have to decline 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.249
 the world is 

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:47.729
 but that they have not seen yet 

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:51.749
 and it is just frustration and it is important and waiting for you 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:59.979

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:02.979

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:06.439
 what would you say 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:09.629
