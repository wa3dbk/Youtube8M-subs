00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
base prep and the flagstone finish for

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.400 
base prep and the flagstone finish for
the<00:02:05.670> base<00:02:05.850> prep<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.859> lay<00:02:07.859> the<00:02:08.459> granite<00:02:08.789> down

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
the base prep you lay the granite down

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.840 
the base prep you lay the granite down
border<00:02:10.410> it<00:02:10.560> with<00:02:11.009> any<00:02:11.340> type<00:02:11.580> of<00:02:11.610> material

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850

border it with any type of material
natural<00:02:12.660> or<00:02:12.870> man-made<00:02:13.230> and<00:02:13.910> then<00:02:14.910> you<00:02:15.000> fill

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
natural or man-made and then you fill

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.180 
natural or man-made and then you fill
and<00:02:15.420> compact<00:02:15.840> it<00:02:16.050> and<00:02:16.680> that<00:02:16.800> would<00:02:16.890> be<00:02:16.950> the

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
and compact it and that would be the

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.400 
and compact it and that would be the
base<00:02:17.400> prep<00:02:17.700> part<00:02:18.000> the<00:02:18.510> second<00:02:18.959> one<00:02:19.080> the

base prep part the second one the
flagstone<00:02:20.040> finish<00:02:20.490> would<00:02:21.180> be<00:02:21.360> you<00:02:21.750> lay<00:02:22.500> your

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
flagstone finish would be you lay your

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.370 
flagstone finish would be you lay your
flagstone<00:02:23.220> down<00:02:23.370> in<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:23.670> patterns<00:02:24.090> that<00:02:24.209> you

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
flagstone down in the patterns that you

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.460 
flagstone down in the patterns that you
that<00:02:25.380> you<00:02:25.530> like<00:02:25.860> and<00:02:26.220> then<00:02:26.819> you<00:02:27.000> fill<00:02:27.330> still<00:02:28.290> in

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
that you like and then you fill still in

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.280 
that you like and then you fill still in
the<00:02:28.560> cracks<00:02:28.860> with<00:02:29.070> a<00:02:29.100> grout<00:02:29.370> line<00:02:29.610> with<00:02:29.940> the

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
the cracks with a grout line with the

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.050 
the cracks with a grout line with the
with<00:02:30.830> the<00:02:30.920> crushed<00:02:31.159> granite<00:02:31.430> and<00:02:31.700> then<00:02:31.970> you

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
with the crushed granite and then you

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.850 
with the crushed granite and then you
wet<00:02:32.299> it<00:02:32.330> down<00:02:32.659> and<00:02:32.959> you<00:02:33.140> repeat<00:02:33.470> that<00:02:33.620> process

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
wet it down and you repeat that process

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.390 
wet it down and you repeat that process
until<00:02:34.400> you've<00:02:35.239> completed<00:02:35.420> your<00:02:35.810> patio<00:02:36.400> you're

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
until you've completed your patio you're

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.490 
until you've completed your patio you're
just<00:02:37.640> a<00:02:37.700> few<00:02:37.909> of<00:02:38.180> the<00:02:38.209> clips<00:02:38.510> of<00:02:38.810> us<00:02:38.959> doing<00:02:39.230> the

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
just a few of the clips of us doing the

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.670 
just a few of the clips of us doing the
steps<00:02:39.739> we<00:02:39.950> just<00:02:39.980> outlined<00:02:40.610> and<00:02:40.970> I<00:02:41.900> know<00:02:41.959> I<00:02:42.530> know

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
steps we just outlined and I know I know

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.759 
steps we just outlined and I know I know
we're<00:02:43.340> using<00:02:43.579> a<00:02:43.730> wheel<00:02:44.000> loader<00:02:44.439> most<00:02:45.439> of<00:02:45.620> you

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
we're using a wheel loader most of you

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:47.050 
we're using a wheel loader most of you
are<00:02:45.920> not<00:02:46.099> going<00:02:46.129> to<00:02:46.459> have<00:02:46.610> one<00:02:46.849> of<00:02:46.970> those

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
are not going to have one of those

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.750 
are not going to have one of those
accessible<00:02:47.720> but<00:02:48.409> you<00:02:48.860> will<00:02:49.069> have<00:02:49.370> a<00:02:49.459> wheel

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
accessible but you will have a wheel

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.390 
accessible but you will have a wheel
barrel<00:02:50.150> or<00:02:50.329> some<00:02:50.540> type<00:02:50.750> of<00:02:51.099> carrying<00:02:52.099> device

barrel or some type of carrying device

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.220 
barrel or some type of carrying device
to<00:02:52.670> get<00:02:52.819> the<00:02:53.030> material<00:02:53.599> where<00:02:53.720> you<00:02:53.750> need<00:02:53.989> to<00:02:54.110> be

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
to get the material where you need to be

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.160 
to get the material where you need to be
you<00:02:54.950> know<00:02:55.069> pile<00:02:55.340> it<00:02:55.519> up<00:02:55.670> and<00:02:55.909> basically<00:02:56.170> smooth

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
you know pile it up and basically smooth

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.530 
you know pile it up and basically smooth
it<00:02:57.409> out<00:02:57.530> until<00:02:58.159> you<00:02:58.250> get<00:02:58.400> to<00:02:58.579> this<00:02:58.730> step<00:02:59.060> where

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
it out until you get to this step where

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.630 
it out until you get to this step where
you're<00:03:00.290> going<00:03:00.439> to<00:03:00.500> need<00:03:00.530> a<00:03:00.680> border<00:03:01.159> otherwise

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:09.129 
you level out all of your stones
together<00:04:07.629> because<00:04:08.629> each<00:04:08.870> Stone<00:04:09.109> has

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:09.139 
together because each Stone has

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:11.289 
together because each Stone has
different<00:04:09.859> thicknesses<00:04:10.370> they're<00:04:11.090> going<00:04:11.239> to

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
different thicknesses they're going to

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:13.149 
different thicknesses they're going to
be<00:04:11.389> close<00:04:11.660> to<00:04:11.690> the<00:04:11.900> same<00:04:12.109> but<00:04:12.410> stone<00:04:12.980> is

00:04:13.149 --> 00:04:13.159 
be close to the same but stone is

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:15.699 
be close to the same but stone is
naturally<00:04:13.699> variant<00:04:14.209> so<00:04:14.989> you'll<00:04:15.379> lay<00:04:15.590> this

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
naturally variant so you'll lay this

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:18.490 
naturally variant so you'll lay this
down<00:04:15.769> and<00:04:16.190> he's<00:04:16.310> just<00:04:16.459> using<00:04:16.669> a<00:04:16.880> 2x4<00:04:17.479> to<00:04:17.750> spread

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
down and he's just using a 2x4 to spread

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.370 
down and he's just using a 2x4 to spread
it<00:04:18.620> out<00:04:18.709> and<00:04:19.010> then<00:04:19.789> soon<00:04:20.060> after<00:04:20.269> he'll<00:04:21.109> be<00:04:21.289> able

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
it out and then soon after he'll be able

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.820 
it out and then soon after he'll be able
to<00:04:21.560> take<00:04:22.460> these<00:04:22.669> pieces<00:04:23.030> and<00:04:23.510> place<00:04:24.380> them<00:04:24.409> all

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
to take these pieces and place them all

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.890 
to take these pieces and place them all
throughout<00:04:25.550> the<00:04:25.639> patio<00:04:25.940> and<00:04:26.510> after<00:04:26.750> a<00:04:26.810> little
