00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:06.480
 hello to all today i'm going to you 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.700
 introduce the technique of water marc 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.410
 beuls with two patterns that I realized 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.130
 with varnishes president of the brand 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.130
 she loves more mystical 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.230
 and 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.960
 Yes 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.300
 at first I'll go 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.490
 show the marble pattern and that is 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.560
 really the most classic pattern so 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.870
 I will take masking tape which is 

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:44.760
 a kind of paper adhesives 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.100
 much less sticky than Scotch and 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.870
 I'm going on break and so a band in 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.309
 bottom of my nail and then a second in 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.290
 top of my nail to properly address the 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.790
 cuticle will then fill a jar with 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:58.320
 of water here chooses water from 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.730
 faucet help some people who 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.780
 prefer to use mineral water to 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.640
 it always worked with water 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.220
 of the tap and I will then open the 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.320
 bottles of varnishes I chose I 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.330
 then put my first drop of 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.890
 varnish in the water you see which of 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.330
 vases very well so varnishes or 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.770
 take that walk for the water a flight 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.140
 it's really nail polish 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.910
 buttes will flake into a circle 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.410
 concentric so then I'm going 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.630
 add a third group comes to 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.560
 center and so on with the greens 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.560
 lament that I chose 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.010
 how 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.450
 I will now come to realize the 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.100
 pattern of my tree and using a 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.920
 toothpick so two important things 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.790
 the first is to clean the pic on 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.040
 a tissue 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.360
 between each line and the second it's 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.650
 not to touch the diaper 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.630
 external that is already dry 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.150
 you have to start from the second color or 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.590
 the third color for example i'm going 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.480
 now 30 and my fingernail in the area 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.280
 of my choice so my nail was 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.340
 previously varnished in a layer of 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.540
 white varnish to make it more opaque 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.070
 I blow on the water to dry 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.480
 the nail polish then when the last is 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.790
 than using another wooden sticks 

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:15.050
 I'm going to turn between my fingers 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:16.760
 to remove the tarnished excess I 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.140
 then cleans the outline of my fingernail 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.680
 using a flat brush and 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.330
 remover 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.830
 so you see that the varnish is removed 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.300
 very well if you do it all from 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.850
 after making your drummer 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.260
 marc beuls i'm going now 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.550
 show a second technique and the 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.140
 technique of the millefeuille so always 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.420
 same principle i'm going to take a pot 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.550
 of water I will protect my fingernail the same 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.320
 way I will see composed of drops of 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.170
 varnish in a pot the only difference 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.550
 here that I'm going to put a lot more 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.410
 just now I put it simple 6 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:45.080
 disgusts I believe here I'm going to put some 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.730
 plus 10 or 12 for the drops 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.400
 really spreads to reach the 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.900
 edges of my post so little trick 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.190
 if you see that your drops are spreading 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.020
 could leave you can take a cure 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:58.000
 tooth and touch the edges of the pot for 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.000
 really dilate the drops again 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.280
 so at the level of the pattern here I'm going 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.870
 from the center with my toothpick then 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.980
 I'm going back to the center of 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.810
 outside in always 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.640
 without touching the outer layers then 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.050
 I will leave the center and touch 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.239
 really it's important to seal 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.709
 your pattern on the edges if you do not 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.260
 do not know and therefore not touch the edges 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.850
 of the po motivates him to deviate it will do 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.580
 a bit weird stuff so really 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.140
 very important really touched the pot 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.030
 when when are you going from the inside 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.220
 outward and I'm going to do the 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.630
 fewer reasons all but one you 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.260
 do not have to do everything 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.580
 the turn in fact the center on the other hand if 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.830
 you make several you go 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.480
 have more choice to choose the area 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.920
 where you go to soak your hand you 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.600
 see here that I dipped a single 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.790
 nails but I did it at the time 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.530
 in two years ago I had thirty 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.640
 and two or three fingers at a time in 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.739
 the same pattern it can be pretty 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.700
 economical in terms of polish if you 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:54.569
 want or it's a time saving is 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.130
 kid so then you do not have any more 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.720
 to apply a good layer of top 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.430
 coat to keep this manicure more 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.200
 a long time so this video now 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.459
 I hope you have enjoyed it 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.320

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.209
 nails
