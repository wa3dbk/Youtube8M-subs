 elementary school children and this was one of the annual robotic tournaments 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.539
 for each child he participated with a scale robot that they programmed to save and

 a difficult competition like the tiny world of robotics 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.920
 there we were nervous 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.590

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.200
 dedication and teamwork several were awarded
