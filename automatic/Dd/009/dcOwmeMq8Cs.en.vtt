00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
even take up that much ram so let's go

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.920 
even take up that much ram so let's go
see<00:00:41.489> how<00:00:41.580> much<00:00:41.730> usage<00:00:42.150> it<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:43.940> only<00:00:44.940> 217

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
see how much usage it is and only 217

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.110 
see how much usage it is and only 217
megabytes<00:00:46.379> which<00:00:46.500> is<00:00:46.710> pretty<00:00:46.890> light<00:00:47.159> or<00:00:47.730> 17

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120

kilobytes<00:00:48.510> it's<00:00:48.830> light<00:00:49.830> and<00:00:50.220> it<00:00:50.820> doesn't<00:00:51.089> slow

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:51.269 
kilobytes it's light and it doesn't slow

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:54.469 
kilobytes it's light and it doesn't slow
down<00:00:51.300> your<00:00:51.570> computer<00:00:51.600> at<00:00:52.199> all<00:00:52.470> it<00:00:53.129> scans<00:00:54.000> and

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:54.479 
down your computer at all it scans and

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:58.520 
down your computer at all it scans and
it<00:00:54.600> uses<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:56.210> what's<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.269> con<00:00:57.530> cloud

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
it uses a what's the con cloud

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.350 
it uses a what's the con cloud
protection<00:00:59.190> that's<00:00:59.489> what<00:00:59.640> citron<00:00:59.970> told<00:01:00.239> me

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
protection that's what citron told me

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.060 
protection that's what citron told me
but<00:01:00.510> I<00:01:00.570> don't<00:01:00.720> really<00:01:00.809> care<00:01:01.110> because<00:01:01.650> I<00:01:01.800> just

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
this link in the description and once

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
download this is a beta by the way I

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.440 
download this is a beta by the way I
think<00:01:15.770> so<00:01:16.770> once<00:01:17.280> you're<00:01:17.430> at<00:01:17.579> the<00:01:17.610> site<00:01:18.090> where

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
think so once you're at the site where

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.179 
think so once you're at the site where
it's<00:01:18.539> just<00:01:18.570> like<00:01:18.750> your<00:01:19.020> windows<00:01:19.320> version<00:01:20.009> at

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
it's just like your windows version at

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.880 
it's just like your windows version at
this<00:01:20.520> part<00:01:20.789> you<00:01:21.719> click<00:01:21.990> on<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.259> 32-bit<00:01:22.740> or

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
this part you click on the 32-bit or

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.069 
this part you click on the 32-bit or
64-bit<00:01:23.100> if<00:01:24.000> you<00:01:24.149> don't<00:01:24.299> know<00:01:24.420> what<00:01:24.630> bit<00:01:24.899> your

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:25.079 
64-bit if you don't know what bit your

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:26.469 
64-bit if you don't know what bit your
computer<00:01:25.469> is<00:01:25.560> just<00:01:25.710> go<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:25.950> your<00:01:26.100> Start<00:01:26.369> button

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
computer is just go to your Start button

down<00:01:32.549> until<00:01:33.060> you<00:01:33.180> see<00:01:33.240> system<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:34.350> said

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
down until you see system and I said

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.910 
down until you see system and I said
system<00:01:34.829> time<00:01:35.009> 64-bit<00:01:35.939> or<00:01:36.119> 32-bit<00:01:36.649> so<00:01:37.649> if<00:01:37.799> it's

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
system time 64-bit or 32-bit so if it's

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.450 
system time 64-bit or 32-bit so if it's
a<00:01:37.979> 64-bit<00:01:38.609> you<00:01:38.700> get<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:38.939> 64<00:01:39.450> bit<00:01:39.630> download<00:01:39.810> I

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
a 64-bit you get the 64 bit download I

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.340 
a 64-bit you get the 64 bit download I
already<00:01:41.460> installed<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:42.479> it's<00:01:42.929> only<00:01:43.109> three

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
already installed it so it's only three

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.510 
already installed it so it's only three
megabytes<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:43.920> shouldn't<00:01:44.159> even<00:01:44.310> take<00:01:44.490> that

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
megabytes and shouldn't even take that

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.990 
megabytes and shouldn't even take that
long<00:01:44.780> so<00:01:45.780> get<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.200> 32<00:01:46.590> bit<00:01:46.619> or<00:01:46.770> 64<00:01:47.250> bit<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.850> go

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
long so get the 32 bit or 64 bit and go

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.480 
long so get the 32 bit or 64 bit and go
ahead<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:48.420> download<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:48.899> so<00:01:49.770> once<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:50.460> have

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
ahead and download it so once you have

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.249 
ahead and download it so once you have
it<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:50.909> should<00:01:51.270> be<00:01:51.299> good<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.929> don't<00:01:52.079> have<00:01:52.170> to

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
it you should be good you don't have to

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.440 
it you should be good you don't have to
restart<00:01:52.619> I<00:01:52.829> think<00:01:53.130> or<00:01:53.340> yeah<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.119> don't<00:01:54.420> need

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
restart I think or yeah you don't need

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.139 
restart I think or yeah you don't need
