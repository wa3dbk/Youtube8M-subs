offering<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:15.960> little<00:01:16.049> more<00:01:16.259> durability<00:01:16.650> the

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
offering a little more durability the

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.969 
offering a little more durability the
gussets<00:01:17.820> on<00:01:17.909> these<00:01:18.090> fingers<00:01:18.570> it's<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.500> kind<00:01:19.920> of

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
little bit cooler as well as decreasing

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.359 
little bit cooler as well as decreasing
that<00:01:27.210> drying<00:01:27.540> time<00:01:27.930> I'm<00:01:28.770> going<00:01:29.009> on<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.280> the

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
that drying time I'm going on to the

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.100 
that drying time I'm going on to the
liner<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.790> this<00:01:29.909> guy<00:01:30.090> you<00:01:30.570> can<00:01:30.720> see<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:30.899> has<00:01:30.930> a
