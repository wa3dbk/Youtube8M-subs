this<00:01:38.960> there<00:01:39.530> were<00:01:39.619> a<00:01:39.770> lot<00:01:39.979> of<00:01:40.009> maritime

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
this there were a lot of maritime

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.700 
this there were a lot of maritime
municipalities<00:01:41.840> have<00:01:42.080> not<00:01:42.229> received<00:01:42.619> the

so<00:01:44.810> now<00:01:44.990> we're<00:01:45.200> on<00:01:45.320> the<00:01:45.440> same<00:01:45.710> page<00:01:46.039> that<00:01:46.100> in

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
so now we're on the same page that in

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.820 
so now we're on the same page that in
theory<00:01:47.119> if<00:01:47.299> we<00:01:47.450> had<00:01:47.600> a<00:01:47.630> chase<00:01:47.930> their<00:01:48.409> role<00:01:48.680> they

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
theory if we had a chase their role they

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.139 
theory if we had a chase their role they
didn't<00:01:49.310> really<00:01:49.430> know<00:01:49.670> what<00:01:49.819> their<00:01:49.970> role<00:01:50.090> was

didn't really know what their role was

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:52.779 
didn't really know what their role was
and<00:01:50.990> this<00:01:51.200> past<00:01:51.470> solidified<00:01:52.039> what<00:01:52.399> their<00:01:52.610> role

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 
and this past solidified what their role

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:54.969 
and this past solidified what their role
is<00:01:52.970> and<00:01:53.000> what<00:01:53.270> the<00:01:53.390> responsibilities<00:01:54.170> are<00:01:54.380> if

it's<00:03:15.720> my<00:03:15.930> understanding<00:03:15.990> Lazlo<00:03:16.860> has<00:03:17.040> only

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
it's my understanding Lazlo has only

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.920 
it's my understanding Lazlo has only
taught<00:03:17.400> this<00:03:17.550> specific<00:03:18.060> class<00:03:18.180> five<00:03:18.630> times

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930

boats all the way to the Bahamas and we

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:30.320
