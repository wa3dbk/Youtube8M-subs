could<00:00:35.100> put<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.309> render<00:00:35.579> distance<00:00:35.700> up<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.180> you

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
could put the render distance up to you

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.900 
could put the render distance up to you
know<00:00:36.719> really<00:00:37.230> far<00:00:37.530> then<00:00:37.829> I'd<00:00:37.950> show<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.219> but<00:00:38.399> if

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
us i fired it sort of roughly guess

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.360 
us i fired it sort of roughly guess
where<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.730> range<00:00:53.940> was<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.629> I<00:00:55.230> swarm<00:00:55.590> out<00:00:55.710> and

where the range was and I swarm out and

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.160 
where the range was and I swarm out and
I<00:00:56.520> must<00:00:56.760> have<00:00:56.910> gone<00:00:57.090> about<00:00:57.660> me<00:00:58.250> 120<00:00:59.250> bricks<00:01:00.170> 120

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
I must have gone about me 120 bricks 120

don't know aight bricks long by about
six<00:01:09.570> brooks<00:01:09.840> high<00:01:10.020> and<00:01:10.710> i<00:01:10.920> swam<00:01:11.189> back<00:01:11.340> and

testified my cannon and it decimated it
in<00:01:13.619> one<00:01:13.740> shot<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:14.400> was<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.549> really<00:01:14.820> really<00:01:15.090> good

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
in one shot it was a really really good

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.249 
in one shot it was a really really good
shot<00:01:15.540> it's<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:15.930> 120<00:01:16.680> block<00:01:17.070> range<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:18.259> firing

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
shot it's a 120 block range and firing

shot it's a 120 block range and firing
to<00:01:19.409> charge<00:01:19.680> it<00:01:19.890> deals<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.610> massive<00:01:21.030> amount<00:01:21.210> of

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
to charge it deals a massive amount of

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.600 
to charge it deals a massive amount of
damage<00:01:21.570> so<00:01:21.840> i'm<00:01:22.500> gonna<00:01:22.590> quit<00:01:22.830> talking<00:01:23.220> now<00:01:23.400> and

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
damage so i'm gonna quit talking now and

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.090 
damage so i'm gonna quit talking now and
let's<00:01:24.180> Sammy<00:01:24.540> show<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:24.900> what<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.140> can<00:01:25.259> do<00:01:25.380> so

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
let's Sammy show you what you can do so

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.280 
let's Sammy show you what you can do so
yeah<00:01:26.340> here<00:01:26.610> we<00:01:26.670> go<00:01:28.549> charge<00:01:29.549> and<00:01:29.880> shot<00:01:30.290> farm

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
yeah here we go charge and shot farm

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.490 
yeah here we go charge and shot farm
hole<00:01:31.759> so<00:01:32.759> glad<00:01:33.000> it's<00:01:33.689> out<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:33.930> distance

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
hole so glad it's out of distance

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.600 
hole so glad it's out of distance
because<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.009> can't<00:01:35.460> really<00:01:35.790> show<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.450> like

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.950 
because I can't really show you it like
with<00:01:38.610> good<00:01:38.850> render<00:01:39.210> settings<00:01:39.570> because<00:01:39.720> my

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
with good render settings because my

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.390 
with good render settings because my
computer<00:01:40.079> won't<00:01:40.500> take<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:40.740> i'm<00:01:40.979> lagging<00:01:41.130> a<00:01:41.369> bit

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
computer won't take it i'm lagging a bit

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.550 
computer won't take it i'm lagging a bit
as<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.700> is<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.090> I'm<00:01:42.180> processing<00:01:42.990> things<00:01:43.380> at

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
as it is and I'm processing things at

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.130 
as it is and I'm processing things at
normal<00:01:43.890> distance<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.899> backed<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:46.049> up

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
normal distance I backed it up

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.539 
normal distance I backed it up
especially<00:01:46.290> for<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:46.829> guys<00:01:46.979> for<00:01:47.159> this<00:01:47.280> video

together<00:01:49.200> but<00:01:50.040> yeah<00:01:50.130> basically<00:01:50.310> it's<00:01:50.820> a

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
together but yeah basically it's a

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.420 
together but yeah basically it's a
development<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.570> my<00:01:51.659> original<00:01:51.780> canon<00:01:52.430> except

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
development of my original canon except

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.480 
development of my original canon except
the<00:01:53.759> firing<00:01:54.540> pin<00:01:54.750> for<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.079> shot<00:01:55.560> comes<00:01:56.130> around

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
the firing pin for the shot comes around

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.459 
the firing pin for the shot comes around
the<00:01:56.850> edge<00:01:56.969> so<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:57.780> doesn't<00:01:58.049> get<00:01:58.110> in<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.259> way<00:01:58.350> of

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
the edge so it doesn't get in the way of

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.780 
the edge so it doesn't get in the way of
like<00:01:58.680> all<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.890> charges<00:01:59.219> and<00:01:59.280> stuff<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.700> the

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
like all the charges and stuff and the

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.340 
like all the charges and stuff and the
charge<00:02:00.000> chamber<00:02:00.390> is<00:02:00.450> doubled<00:02:00.689> at<00:02:00.780> this<00:02:00.899> double

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
charge chamber is doubled at this double

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.770 
charge chamber is doubled at this double
the<00:02:01.439> width<00:02:01.560> is<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:02.759> barrel<00:02:03.090> down<00:02:03.240> there<00:02:03.509> to

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
the width is the barrel down there to

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.179 
the width is the barrel down there to
firing<00:02:04.049> plates<00:02:04.350> at<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.500> bottom<00:02:04.829> support<00:02:05.130> the

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
firing plates at the bottom support the

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.550 
firing plates at the bottom support the
bricks<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.759> basically<00:02:06.540> autistics<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.380> wall

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
bricks and basically autistics the wall

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.859 
bricks and basically autistics the wall
the<00:02:08.190> glass<00:02:08.340> is<00:02:08.369> there<00:02:08.700> just<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:09.239> know<00:02:09.330> just
