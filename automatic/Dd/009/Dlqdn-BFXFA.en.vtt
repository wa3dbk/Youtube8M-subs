00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
that when he pushed me over and I went

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.340 
that when he pushed me over and I went
back<00:02:15.860> right<00:02:16.700> side<00:02:17.030> up<00:02:17.330> i<00:02:17.569> just<00:02:17.810> went<00:02:18.020> flying

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
back right side up i just went flying

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.800 
back right side up i just went flying
because<00:02:18.800> of<00:02:18.950> all<00:02:19.100> the<00:02:19.250> power<00:02:19.459> but<00:02:19.970> you<00:02:20.660> know

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810

because of all the power but you know
that's<00:02:21.200> just<00:02:21.350> what<00:02:21.560> I'm<00:02:21.890> guessing<00:02:22.250> I<00:02:22.819> guess<00:02:23.300> I

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
that's just what I'm guessing I guess I

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.420

should<00:02:23.840> do<00:02:23.990> a<00:02:24.020> little<00:02:24.319> bit<00:02:24.500> more<00:02:24.680> research<00:02:24.950> on

should do a little bit more research on
this<00:02:25.610> if<00:02:25.970> I<00:02:26.360> find<00:02:26.660> anything<00:02:27.020> I'll<00:02:27.350> posted<00:02:28.070> in
