00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:22.480 
we get home look I'd have to say the

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.750 
we get home look I'd have to say the
interior<00:01:22.720> definitely<00:01:23.260> the<00:01:23.380> interior<00:01:23.830> there

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 
interior definitely the interior there

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:25.680 
interior definitely the interior there
looks<00:01:24.910> like<00:01:25.000> there's<00:01:25.270> enough<00:01:25.450> legroom

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
looks like there's enough legroom

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.900
