00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
suppose assumptions that it's it's easy

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.700 
suppose assumptions that it's it's easy
realistically<00:01:00.059> so<00:01:00.840> what<00:01:01.140> happens<00:01:01.469> when<00:01:01.590> I

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
realistically so what happens when I

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.439 
realistically so what happens when I
normally<00:01:02.070> do<00:01:02.250> these<00:01:02.430> kind<00:01:02.730> of<00:01:02.850> things<00:01:02.910> is<00:01:03.329> I

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
normally do these kind of things is I

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.000 
normally do these kind of things is I
get<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.719> lot<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:03.899> personal<00:01:04.350> messages<00:01:04.739> from

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
and the only two gameplays were actually

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.450

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
use the sniper rifle and again I found

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.810 
use the sniper rifle and again I found
it<00:01:32.549> quite<00:01:32.670> easy<00:01:33.229> you<00:01:34.229> know<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.490> suppose<00:01:35.490> in<00:01:35.790> some

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
it quite easy you know I suppose in some

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.819 
it quite easy you know I suppose in some
respects<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.570> can<00:01:36.720> be<00:01:36.840> fun<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.229> do<00:01:37.350> for<00:01:37.590> about

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
respects it can be fun to do for about

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.679 
respects it can be fun to do for about
five<00:01:38.189> minutes<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.820> then<00:01:38.880> it's<00:01:39.090> like<00:01:39.180> I<00:01:39.450> don't

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
five minutes and then it's like I don't

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.380 
always make videos talking about how I
think<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.780> hipfire<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.909> most<00:01:56.909> of<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.180> guns

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
think the hipfire and most of the guns

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.910 
think the hipfire and most of the guns
in<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.659> game<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:57.990> is<00:01:58.110> just<00:01:58.350> overpowered

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
in the game it is just overpowered

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.130 
in the game it is just overpowered
anyway<00:01:59.219> I<00:01:59.250> do<00:01:59.399> really<00:01:59.880> believe<00:02:00.149> that<00:02:00.630> the

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
anyway I do really believe that the

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.899 
anyway I do really believe that the
hipfire<00:02:01.350> spread<00:02:01.590> should<00:02:02.100> be<00:02:02.219> absolutely

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
hipfire spread should be absolutely

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.359 
hipfire spread should be absolutely
gargantuan<00:02:03.829> compared<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:04.950> what<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.100> is

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
gargantuan compared to what it is

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.310 
gargantuan compared to what it is
whereas<00:02:06.000> it's<00:02:06.180> just<00:02:06.420> too<00:02:06.570> easy<00:02:06.600> it's<00:02:07.049> just<00:02:07.229> too

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
whereas it's just too easy it's just too

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.410 
whereas it's just too easy it's just too
easy<00:02:07.350> to<00:02:07.619> put<00:02:07.740> on<00:02:07.770> steady<00:02:08.160> aim<00:02:08.340> and<00:02:08.550> go<00:02:09.239> around

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
easy to put on steady aim and go around

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.360 
easy to put on steady aim and go around
and<00:02:09.599> not<00:02:09.720> even<00:02:09.959> bother<00:02:10.170> using<00:02:10.379> alt<00:02:10.739> button<00:02:11.069> so

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370

what it is and my argument about that is

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.599 
what it is and my argument about that is
why<00:04:16.930> do<00:04:16.989> you<00:04:17.289> never<00:04:17.410> have<00:04:17.620> killcam<00:04:18.100> lag<00:04:18.280> on<00:04:18.459> any

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
killcam are never dispute because you

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:26.370 
killcam are never dispute because you
never<00:04:25.570> have<00:04:25.840> kill<00:04:26.110> cam

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
never have kill cam

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.350

like it only seems to be the snipers
where<00:04:28.540> they<00:04:28.750> come<00:04:28.990> up<00:04:29.110> inside<00:04:29.380> skill<00:04:29.680> chem

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890 
where they come up inside skill chem

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.340 
where they come up inside skill chem
lang<00:04:30.070> that's<00:04:30.400> why<00:04:30.640> it's<00:04:31.150> shown<00:04:31.390> the<00:04:31.510> bully<00:04:31.690> 55

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350
