00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:11.849
 hurt all guys here is satto 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.380
 episode number 19 of the mythbusters 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.430
 let's start right away with the first question is 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.170
 true that using the suits from 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.289
 scientist then those who have one 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.400
 gas mask anyway 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.779
 incorporated of the new update 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.180
 of robberies that is no longer now 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.550
 the latest update is successful 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.109
 survive the gas 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.030
 theoretically it should be so because 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.500
 these masks are antigas though 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.500
 let's see right away by launching this 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.180
 beautiful gas bombs 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.079
 here's attention the stink starts 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.390
 get the stench right out of gypsies and the 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:50.480
 they give guys blatantly the 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:53.850
 damage there so i'd say it's busted 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.250
 we can't survive we say al 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.670
 gas with the gas mask that somewhat 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.469
 ridiculous really a serious second mistake 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.930
 me from the rock star that would go 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.280
 absolutely solved 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.320
 he even took the star to be there 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.110
 become a suicide anyway myth 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.700
 number 118 putting a sticky bomb on 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.729
 a car that then goes into the race 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.700
 there's the sticky bomb disappears 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.470
 let's see immediately then 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.810
 let 's say the test is if it remains not if 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.640
 it disappears because theoretically it should 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.020
 stay here is how you see the bomb is 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.049
 was poured in a decidedly place 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.670
 visible on this cup 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.920
 machine from peanuts that if the 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.119
 brought to the resale they give you there is a 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.799
 slap you were watching given a slap 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.210
 resume 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.000
 here we are about to enter mine 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.189
 full garage luxury apartment 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.810
 attention this is a problemuccio e 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.509
 oh well let's throw out a vehicle a lot 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.770
 there is a scrapped van now though 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.970
 maybe he deigns to load this game 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.579
 here I would say to throw out 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:57.119
 this blue shark van 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.770
 drawn because really bad and not 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.590
 befits this place here is the 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.149
 our car and I would say that there is no more 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.020
 sticky bomb now maybe we go to 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.670
 check also on the other side 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:12.700
 there is no boys it has disappeared and therefore it is 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.190
 confirmed guys disappears incredible 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.349
 and this is another 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.120
 another mistake another error though 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:23.049
 this is normal let's say it is so in 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:26.049
 There have been some documents in the background 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:31.030
 in 2d 118 I wish I had made a coffin 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:33.549
 however you can hook a jet with the 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.049
 cargo bubbler we went to the airport 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.400
 of los santos as you see now 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:38.970
 we will try to make a maneuver that 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.290
 seems like something quite impossible 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.180
 I really don't think we'll know why 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.769
 it wouldn't even make sense I don't think 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.180
 not even that he has enough strength in 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.860
 in which case he could get hooked e 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.599
 Who knows what 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.970
 here looks something else guys this 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:55.030
 scene makes me think of something else quite 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.709
 of sick and sick portions 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.599
 above all, we also have the three 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.010
 stars and therefore the situation becomes 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:02.519
 really bad maybe we try with a 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:06.190
 other jet for now seems to be busted 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:09.400
 how right it was because it was 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.410
 in short it is unthinkable to hook a 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.859
 airliner with the hunchback thistle 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.030
 meanwhile an incredible clash in the air 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:18.819
 here these people are practically 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.850
 identical to the previous one then result 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:23.440
 should not change does not happen 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.840
 absolutely nothing guys but after all 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.030
 what you can think of the hook e 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.280
 possibly some if you hook 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.530
 he would never have cargo to carry 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.599
 a weight so high even if you can 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.549
 so bring the tank anyway 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:38.349
 so high it is able to carry them though 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:40.989
 we do not say of this caliber 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:42.880
 then it's really too big for him 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.530
 meanwhile this police broke me 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.799
 balls because I'm experimenting 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.180
 of scientific importance of international importance 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.560
 for which they want to give me the prize 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.299
 nobel and therefore it is unacceptable that 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.130
 come to intervene I want to throw 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:57.310
 down this bernat helicopter 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.690
 look at how I pay attention to it 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.790
 that now I go down the right 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:04.750
 by which I am now down here is 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:06.670
 precipitating notes managed to get up and 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.640
 he does not deny that yes I am falling 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:13.090
 I don't believe it is not possible from that 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:17.200
 fooling guys I lost my cargo 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:19.930
 bob still myth number 119 suicide 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.850
 with the helmet it normally happens as 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.250
 we know the bulletproof helmet is 

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:26.770
 been entered online gt provides us 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.540
 a protection against blows to the head or 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.030
 no more a blow to the head for 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.410
 get out if I want more 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.860
 then a stirring like gun 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:38.050
 when you shoot yourself in the head the 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.350
 cas contained indeed the eco function 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.460
 theoretically it should work 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.080
 however it is as you see I do not now 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.490
 already possess this helmet otherwise 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.810
 you can buy them at any store 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.890
 to do you too 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:56.010
 the test now we head out for 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:59.920
 commit suicide commit suicide here kill yourself 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:01.510
 0 should cost indeed though it has 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.220
 boys was in passive mode then 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.430
 did it with the tablet I made a 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:10.800
 crazy movie so let's try again 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:12.040
 raising the passive mode here we are 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.570
 dom 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.160
 one shot guys so it is 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.710
 confirmed 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.560
 just one stroke to exit with a helmet 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.210
 bulletproof which is a mistake a 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.610
 mistake 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:26.680
 in short, however, it is really important to 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.890
 end there is a mistake there can be 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:32.020
 I fall 120 you can kill more 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.940
 of two people with the sniper rifle 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.410
 I repeat to the boys when I do 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.580
 a question from the mit basta had to be 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:38.140
 specific 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.930
 it is not a question that asks how many 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:43.139
 people die with the sniper 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.639
 it's suitable so we'll see if we can 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:48.690
 kill more than two people you are 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:51.320
 lined up bloom triple killer guys 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:53.729
 so even a triple is 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.740
 confirmed you can kill more than 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:58.520
 two people using the rifle from 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:00.930
 sniper if they are well aligned 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.789
 however the result varies from time to time 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:06.060
 time because trying again a little more 

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:08.280
 forward as you see here we try to 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:10.199
 kill our cronies for the first 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:14.400
 Once several subscribers participate in a 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:16.080
 mythbuster although dumb 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.080
 get ready to fire here is here e 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.400
 dead for example only general mind 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.630
 now let's try more to fire 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.070
 this is the death of two others then 

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:25.020
 anyway it depends because maybe mousse al 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:27.330
 bulletproof vest and cushions i 

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.410
 blows and others as there are different 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:30.810
 variables to consider 

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:34.410
 however in general it is possible to do more 

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:37.139
 of two killer with sniper rifle is 

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:40.320
 You can spear a player with him 

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:41.370
 spike of the hunt by way of bayonetta 

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.900
 in conclusion 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:46.710
 here we are on our beautiful 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:49.710
 hunt look what a beautiful load ready 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:53.580
 our collaborators will direct themselves 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:55.830
 in front of us if maybe they move from 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:07:00.419
 I generate reservations, your help, here it is 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:03.120
 is moving perfect and perfect now 

00:07:00.419 --> 00:07:05.580
 so let's try it then it was 

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:07.639
 a shock we should find the question again 

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:09.810
 of fashion 

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:11.820
 guys I would say you can't 

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:13.889
 affect a player with the tip 

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:15.150
 of the hunt and what to say this was 

00:07:13.889 --> 00:07:16.169
 the last myth for today hopes for this 

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:17.909
 video you enjoyed in that case 

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:19.409
