we're not planting berries till June or
July<00:02:33.000> depending<00:02:34.000> on<00:02:34.090> how<00:02:34.210> the<00:02:34.270> season<00:02:34.690> coast

delayed planting of strawberries reduces

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.920 
delayed planting of strawberries reduces
labor<00:02:50.620> costs<00:02:51.160> by<00:02:51.700> reducing<00:02:51.940> the<00:02:52.420> time<00:02:52.450> that

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
labor costs by reducing the time that

every week we shorten the season we save

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.160 
every week we shorten the season we save

our delayed planting system with the aid
of<00:03:07.660> a<00:03:07.840> sailor<00:03:08.110> farmer<00:03:08.530> grower<00:03:08.739> grant<00:03:09.100> we

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
of a sailor farmer grower grant we

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.760 
of a sailor farmer grower grant we
received<00:03:10.530> two<00:03:11.530> two<00:03:12.160> year<00:03:12.580> cycle<00:03:13.150> grants<00:03:13.840> on

received two two year cycle grants on
which<00:03:15.160> we<00:03:15.459> basically<00:03:16.380> trialed<00:03:17.380> planting

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
which we basically trialed planting

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.840 
which we basically trialed planting
densities

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.850 
densities

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.270 
densities
we've<00:03:19.690> trialed<00:03:20.110> everything<00:03:20.440> from<00:03:20.620> six<00:03:20.890> inches

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
we've trialed everything from six inches

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.940 
we've trialed everything from six inches
up<00:03:21.730> to<00:03:22.180> like<00:03:22.600> 36<00:03:23.050> inches<00:03:23.350> apart<00:03:23.709> with

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
up to like 36 inches apart with

up to like 36 inches apart with
different<00:03:24.250> planning<00:03:24.550> systems<00:03:24.940> and<00:03:25.150> basically

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
different planning systems and basically

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.740 
different planning systems and basically
what<00:03:26.140> we<00:03:26.260> found<00:03:26.560> is<00:03:27.400> that<00:03:27.910> if<00:03:28.420> we're<00:03:28.570> going<00:03:28.660> to

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
what we found is that if we're going to

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.020 
what we found is that if we're going to
plant<00:03:29.020> in<00:03:29.320> July<00:03:30.040> we<00:03:30.310> need<00:03:30.489> to<00:03:30.610> reduce<00:03:30.730> our

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
plant in July we need to reduce our

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.300 
plant in July we need to reduce our
spacing<00:03:31.450> down<00:03:31.600> to<00:03:31.780> about<00:03:31.930> six<00:03:32.200> inches<00:03:32.530> if

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
spacing down to about six inches if

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.070 
spacing down to about six inches if
we're<00:03:33.489> going<00:03:33.580> to<00:03:33.640> plant<00:03:33.910> in<00:03:34.120> June<00:03:34.450> we<00:03:34.750> can<00:03:34.900> have

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
we're going to plant in June we can have

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.630 
we're going to plant in June we can have
what<00:03:35.380> you<00:03:35.410> see<00:03:35.650> here<00:03:35.860> which<00:03:35.980> is<00:03:36.040> about<00:03:36.190> 10<00:03:36.370> to

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
what you see here which is about 10 to

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.479 
what you see here which is about 10 to
12<00:03:36.880> inches<00:03:37.230> if<00:03:38.230> you're<00:03:38.410> planting<00:03:38.800> in<00:03:38.920> May<00:03:39.190> you

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
12 inches if you're planting in May you

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.130 
12 inches if you're planting in May you
can<00:03:39.820> go<00:03:39.940> with<00:03:40.060> the<00:03:40.150> customary<00:03:40.630> spacing<00:03:41.110> of

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
can go with the customary spacing of

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.380 
can go with the customary spacing of
about<00:03:41.350> 24<00:03:41.890> inches<00:03:41.920> apart<00:03:42.610> with<00:03:42.850> your<00:03:43.000> plants

comes off late we take more plants we

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.910 
comes off late we take more plants we
just<00:03:52.030> put<00:03:52.780> them<00:03:52.840> in<00:03:52.959> closer
