00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.750
 hello my name is william douglas i am 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.360
 federal judge professor and whole writer 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.700
 Wednesday I'm here with shirt video 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.340
 like shirts and you know I'll get a 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.829
 shirt and you want to send some 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.960
 cool shirt can order here me too 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:29.110
 I will comment her that seen and commented 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.239
 g pomegranate 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.430
 I'm here you just saw a 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:35.860
 thing about the use of gas 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.780
 I'll spare you my terrible 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.850
 pronunciation in English so I will not even 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.610
 risk talking the last one there that does not 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.680
 I'll go and disturb you, but I want to. 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:48.870
 say the following when you say so 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:53.850
 that the old faces that the crowns is 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:56.590
 bossy commands a right are in charge is 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.890
 It bothers a little, you can command a 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:02.410
 but this type of placement is 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.180
 interesting for us to talk about 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.009
 experience 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.460
 of course a new person may have 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:11.530
 experience but generally do not have a 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.079
 New person can be very smart. 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.389
 can be very capable a little bit more 

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:18.520
 of experience helps a lot we have 

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:20.829
 A lot of stories do not like to do 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.959
 very long video on Wednesday then 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:25.509
 I will not mention several, but when 

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:30.039
 for example require age 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:33.999
 minimum to be senator president 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:35.649
 minister of the supreme judge is exactly 

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:39.579
 because she expects the person to have a 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:41.560
 little years road wisdom 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:45.069
 or how do you speak years of window 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.109
 so if you already have some age there 

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:50.409
 I hope that this age has become 

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:53.170
 transformed into maturity and experience 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:56.170
 that your age causes you to be 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.310
 a more educated person more sensible 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.560
 more tolerant 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.380
 if you are already old and have not yet 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.749
 wisdom that age presupposes then 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.520
 when trying to seek such loss 

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:08.380
 I want to recommend the book 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.260
 proverbs for this you get into my 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:14.060
 page has there in the home www 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:17.150
 2.1.1 You will see there in the home the 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.910
 word the letters p you click it has 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.890
 a free downloadable book that will 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.410
 tell you much about wisdom 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.660
 if you are already older you are probably 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.420
 the labor market is going to have some bad 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.400
 Willingness with you rarely is not so 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.650
 and if you have this market problem 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.570
 that the public tender 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.810
 does not do this discrimination 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:41.330
 ok if you're new 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.510
 What's the point of me saying this to you? 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.630
 the point is that you be innovative be 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.000
 creative is rebellious or the employee 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.010
 but that does not stop listening to people 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.980
 be sure to get this 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.540
 already settled wisdom of people who 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.920
 Okay, go look for a good adviser. 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.740
 look for someone you trust in you 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.260
 knows that he is a person who has wisdom 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:06.020
 who has maturity does not take any 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.690
 decision without hearing an older 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:11.420
 When you said man, it's a man or a woman. 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.880
 is an older person lets her talk 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.400
 which is the bible speaks that in the multitude of 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.260
 advice wisdom then before 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.060
 make an important decision to hear the 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.810
 people the final decision is yours but others 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.110
 people 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.750
 It's really the crowns I'm already 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.180
 I already knew in this group 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.860
 something to say who is not crown 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.900
 forget about who is not color or 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.950
 enjoy that interest is there too 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.950
 for this purpose
