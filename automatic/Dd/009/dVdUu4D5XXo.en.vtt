outside<00:00:34.070> the<00:00:34.720> university<00:00:35.720> the<00:00:36.680> school<00:00:37.010> and

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:37.310 
outside the university the school and

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:40.150 
outside the university the school and
chapter<00:00:37.910> one<00:00:38.120> i<00:00:38.530> noticed<00:00:39.530> that<00:00:39.620> sometimes

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
chapter one i noticed that sometimes

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.460 
chapter one i noticed that sometimes
when<00:00:40.430> you<00:00:40.550> go<00:00:40.700> down<00:00:40.880> then<00:00:41.180> too<00:00:41.450> fast<00:00:41.750> you<00:00:42.140> get<00:00:42.410> a

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.470 
when you go down then too fast you get a

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.500 
when you go down then too fast you get a
falling<00:00:43.040> damage<00:00:43.190> i<00:00:43.610> was<00:00:43.760> like<00:00:43.910> hmm<00:00:44.240> why<00:00:44.480> not

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
falling damage i was like hmm why not

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.220 
falling damage i was like hmm why not
just<00:00:44.840> get<00:00:44.990> there<00:00:45.320> so<00:00:46.160> basically<00:00:46.610> just<00:00:47.570> cast<00:00:48.020> a

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
just get there so basically just cast a

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.140 
just get there so basically just cast a
sand<00:00:48.620> go<00:00:48.740> up<00:00:48.860> and<00:00:49.070> down<00:00:49.250> the<00:00:49.400> stairs<00:00:49.640> until<00:00:49.880> you

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:50.150 
sand go up and down the stairs until you

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.830 
sand go up and down the stairs until you
take<00:00:50.360> damage<00:00:50.510> until<00:00:51.020> you<00:00:51.200> die<00:00:52.450> this<00:00:53.450> is<00:00:53.630> fairly

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
take damage until you die this is fairly

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.600 
take damage until you die this is fairly
simple<00:00:54.140> I'm<00:00:54.620> pretty<00:00:54.890> sure<00:00:54.980> nobody's<00:00:55.400> going<00:00:55.550> to

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610 
simple I'm pretty sure nobody's going to

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.080 
simple I'm pretty sure nobody's going to
have<00:00:55.790> a<00:00:55.820> issue<00:00:56.660> with<00:00:56.900> this<00:00:57.080> achievement

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
have a issue with this achievement

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.670 
have a issue with this achievement
although<00:00:59.090> it<00:00:59.180> can<00:00:59.480> take<00:00:59.660> a<00:00:59.720> small<00:01:00.290> while<00:01:00.650> I

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
although it can take a small while I

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.560 
although it can take a small while I
guess<00:01:01.070> because<00:01:01.280> sometimes<00:01:01.910> you<00:01:02.120> go<00:01:02.240> down<00:01:02.450> the

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:02.570 
guess because sometimes you go down the

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.119 
guess because sometimes you go down the
stairs<00:01:02.810> and<00:01:03.110> you<00:01:03.170> don't<00:01:03.350> take<00:01:03.500> find<00:01:03.740> imagine

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
stairs and you don't take find imagine

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.380 
stairs and you don't take find imagine
like<00:01:04.309> what<00:01:04.519> the<00:01:04.670> hell<00:01:05.439> but<00:01:06.439> um<00:01:07.390> because

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
like what the hell but um because

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.030 
like what the hell but um because
falling<00:01:08.810> damage<00:01:08.960> on<00:01:09.259> the<00:01:09.350> stairs<00:01:09.590> it<00:01:09.800> hurts

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
falling damage on the stairs it hurts

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.610 
falling damage on the stairs it hurts
you<00:01:10.280> guys<00:01:10.460> you<00:01:10.670> know<00:01:10.820> mmm<00:01:13.480> so<00:01:14.480> yeah<00:01:14.659> just<00:01:15.020> rinse
