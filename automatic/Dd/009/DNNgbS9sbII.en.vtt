00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
wrong just keep going and if you get a

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.620 
wrong just keep going and if you get a
new<00:05:06.740> idea<00:05:07.070> you<00:05:07.220> just<00:05:07.430> do<00:05:07.760> it<00:05:07.789> but<00:05:08.180> editing<00:05:08.539> is

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
new idea you just do it but editing is

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:09.909 
new idea you just do it but editing is
about<00:05:08.840> refining<00:05:09.169> and<00:05:09.470> I<00:05:09.530> think<00:05:09.740> there's

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
about refining and I think there's

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:11.050 
about refining and I think there's
something<00:05:10.160> about<00:05:10.340> getting<00:05:10.640> to<00:05:10.729> that<00:05:10.820> point

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
something about getting to that point

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.700 
something about getting to that point
where<00:05:11.150> you're<00:05:11.360> kind<00:05:11.539> of<00:05:11.690> making<00:05:11.900> those<00:05:12.229> final

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
where you're kind of making those final

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.469 
where you're kind of making those final
decisions<00:05:13.160> like<00:05:13.490> this<00:05:13.520> is<00:05:14.000> what<00:05:14.150> its<00:05:14.270> gonna<00:05:14.360> be

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:14.479 
decisions like this is what its gonna be

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:16.810 
decisions like this is what its gonna be
when<00:05:14.810> someone<00:05:15.080> reads<00:05:15.289> it<00:05:15.500> is<00:05:15.680> that<00:05:15.919> okay<00:05:16.370> am<00:05:16.700> i

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:16.820 
when someone reads it is that okay am i

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.900 
when someone reads it is that okay am i
okay<00:05:17.120> with<00:05:17.150> that<00:05:17.479> oh<00:05:17.539> my<00:05:17.870> gosh<00:05:18.140> ah<00:05:18.650> i<00:05:19.610> also

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
okay with that oh my gosh ah i also

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:21.100 
okay with that oh my gosh ah i also
think<00:05:20.120> there<00:05:20.300> were<00:05:20.360> days<00:05:20.510> where<00:05:20.720> i<00:05:20.750> would<00:05:20.930> sit

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
think there were days where i would sit

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.020 
think there were days where i would sit
down<00:05:21.289> to<00:05:21.470> write<00:05:21.650> and<00:05:22.010> it<00:05:22.520> would<00:05:22.669> just<00:05:22.789> be<00:05:23.000> like

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
down to write and it would just be like

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.570 
down to write and it would just be like
okay<00:05:23.510> I'm<00:05:23.780> gonna<00:05:23.930> write<00:05:24.229> this<00:05:24.560> and<00:05:24.919> then<00:05:25.430> all

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:25.580 
okay I'm gonna write this and then all

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:26.830 
okay I'm gonna write this and then all
of<00:05:25.610> a<00:05:25.760> sudden<00:05:25.789> that<00:05:26.090> would<00:05:26.240> think<00:05:26.419> of<00:05:26.539> 50

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
of a sudden that would think of 50

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.290 
of a sudden that would think of 50
million<00:05:27.139> other<00:05:27.260> things<00:05:27.380> that<00:05:27.680> I<00:05:27.710> needed<00:05:27.919> to<00:05:28.039> do

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
million other things that I needed to do

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.750 
million other things that I needed to do
which<00:05:29.300> would<00:05:29.479> distract<00:05:29.780> me<00:05:30.110> or<00:05:30.410> take<00:05:31.400> me<00:05:31.460> off

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:31.760 
which would distract me or take me off

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.040 
which would distract me or take me off
down<00:05:32.000> a<00:05:32.030> road<00:05:32.270> that<00:05:32.300> I<00:05:32.510> didn't<00:05:32.750> need<00:05:32.840> to<00:05:32.930> go

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050 
down a road that I didn't need to go

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:34.690 
down a road that I didn't need to go
down<00:05:33.260> and<00:05:33.560> then<00:05:33.770> by<00:05:33.919> the<00:05:33.950> end<00:05:34.070> of<00:05:34.310> my<00:05:34.460> writing

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:34.700 
down and then by the end of my writing

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.129 
down and then by the end of my writing
day<00:05:34.910> I<00:05:34.940> would<00:05:35.150> have<00:05:35.240> really<00:05:35.539> accomplished
