00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
actually angle forward and that would be

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.100 
actually angle forward and that would be
a<00:01:29.369> smaller<00:01:29.790> distance<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.540> can<00:01:30.659> actually<00:01:30.930> run

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110

position like a TT or in a very
aggressive<00:01:35.549> road<00:01:36.479> position<00:01:37.020> so<00:01:37.799> say

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
aggressive road position so say

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.069 
aggressive road position so say
something<00:01:38.369> like<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.790> Khan<00:01:39.390> core<00:01:39.659> will<00:01:39.900> work

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
something like the Khan core will work

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.260 
something like the Khan core will work
great<00:01:40.229> for<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:40.650> positioning<00:01:41.340> but<00:01:41.970> say<00:01:42.240> that

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270
