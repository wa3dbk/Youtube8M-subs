00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.810
 the bags are great there I go 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.810
 think even an entire package purely 

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:16.199
 hello we are we back and times 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:19.170
 willi meier berlin fashion week mode 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:22.820
 theme which we are very interested in 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.820
 they also try to be stylish 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:29.250
 So somehow I think that's shaaf 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.330
 I have to say honestly before the otto 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.330
 nothing under it 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:40.170
 most interesting is here this 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:46.469
 This view protection over the mouth 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:47.600
 the tape with the crest I had 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:55.320
 earlier 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:57.329
 my mother has pulled me look 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.239
 that's a headgear 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.800
 Of course, not every head is like that 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.789
 say that only then has the right one 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.880
 head in 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.619
 yes that's true even though you only see 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.930
 half the head that can be for some yes 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:15.630
 pretty much hey hey, what does she have 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.049
 Here on the shoulder which is leather is 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:22.170
 Her brain pulls the countries as 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.119
 the hand does not have to be or that 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.430
 afterwards shoulder pieces from liver 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:30.630
 maybe those hands on the shoulders 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:33.869
 give it a little bit more 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:39.799
 made up big find the moon well 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.799
 as you can somehow find rand yes 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:46.200
 dark young man with a great me 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.729
 know at all smiles never the men 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.860
 not and the women do not like one 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.200
 not i would buy a lot about that 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.960
 if someone wants to smile that traven 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.079
 No, I believe that person is that 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.060
 a men's enemy has designed it afterwards 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.100
 think he would be a decent 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.259
 jeans and so much that really 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.509
 very nice but so no wonder that 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.049
 who refers to such a flop they have to do so 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.179
 look 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.649
 after all, he does not like what he does 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.050
 but he has to get coal for it 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.330
 I look a bit like that 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.800
 border to fashion abuses but the 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.720
 bags are great 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:23.080
 I believe even a whole package 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:26.210
 Rhine is not a shopping basket 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:30.190
 willy-brandt-house that yes that was good 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:35.870
