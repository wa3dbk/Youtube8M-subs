really<00:07:24.120> overall<00:07:24.630> quite<00:07:25.110> fun<00:07:25.440> so<00:07:25.920> I<00:07:25.950> had<00:07:26.130> a<00:07:26.160> 10<00:07:26.520> I

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:26.790 
really overall quite fun so I had a 10 I

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:29.630 
really overall quite fun so I had a 10 I
would<00:07:27.000> say<00:07:27.180> this<00:07:27.330> is<00:07:27.480> an<00:07:27.630> eight<00:07:27.870> and<00:07:28.110> a<00:07:28.200> half<00:07:28.640> so

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:29.640 
would say this is an eight and a half so

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:33.110 
would say this is an eight and a half so
this<00:07:30.150> is<00:07:30.420> really<00:07:31.220> there's<00:07:32.220> no<00:07:32.400> online<00:07:32.640> play

this is really there's no online play

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.670 
this is really there's no online play
because<00:07:33.390> there<00:07:33.510> wasn't<00:07:33.690> any<00:07:33.930> such<00:07:34.200> thing<00:07:34.470> in

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:34.680 
because there wasn't any such thing in

because there wasn't any such thing in
some<00:07:34.890> games<00:07:35.040> like<00:07:35.310> this<00:07:35.460> back<00:07:36.210> in<00:07:36.240> the<00:07:36.510> day<00:07:36.720> so
