00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.990 
well movie I mean it's it's no wearing
weighing<00:06:46.170> close<00:06:46.410> to<00:06:47.040> being<00:06:47.280> scale<00:06:47.550> I<00:06:47.580> mean<00:06:47.700> the

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.000 
weighing close to being scale I mean the

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.710 
weighing close to being scale I mean the
full-size<00:06:48.510> all<00:06:48.750> smart<00:06:49.140> would<00:06:50.120> be<00:06:51.120> the<00:06:51.270> size<00:06:51.540> of

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:51.720 
full-size all smart would be the size of

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:56.330 
full-size all smart would be the size of
my<00:06:51.810> desk<00:06:52.110> here<00:06:52.380> Wow<00:06:53.390> but<00:06:54.390> I<00:06:54.980> don't<00:06:55.980> think<00:06:56.130> that

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:56.340 
my desk here Wow but I don't think that

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.280 
my desk here Wow but I don't think that
would<00:06:56.430> be<00:06:56.460> very<00:06:56.730> practical<00:06:57.000> but<00:06:57.480> it's<00:06:57.690> this<00:06:58.050> is

00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:58.290 
would be very practical but it's this is

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.920 
would be very practical but it's this is
probably<00:06:58.560> more<00:06:58.740> reasonable<00:06:59.550> for<00:06:59.790> the<00:06:59.970> pull

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:00.930 
probably more reasonable for the pull

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:03.050 
probably more reasonable for the pull
more<00:07:01.080> portable<00:07:01.560> version<00:07:01.950> but<00:07:02.100> this<00:07:02.280> is<00:07:02.520> a<00:07:02.790> lot

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:03.060 
more portable version but this is a lot

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:08.510 
more portable version but this is a lot
more<00:07:03.270> detailed<00:07:03.750> and<00:07:05.120> I<00:07:06.950> think<00:07:07.950> it's<00:07:08.070> worth<00:07:08.280> it

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:08.520 
more detailed and I think it's worth it

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.390 
more detailed and I think it's worth it
I<00:07:08.670> mean<00:07:09.240> it<00:07:09.540> is<00:07:09.720> kind<00:07:10.260> of<00:07:10.320> expensive<00:07:10.770> when<00:07:11.280> you

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:11.400 
I mean it is kind of expensive when you

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:15.490 
I mean it is kind of expensive when you
think<00:07:11.670> about<00:07:11.730> it<00:07:12.090> but<00:07:13.020> if<00:07:13.620> you<00:07:13.860> really<00:07:13.950> want<00:07:14.550> a

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:15.500 
think about it but if you really want a

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:20.180 
think about it but if you really want a
good<00:07:17.540> representation<00:07:18.540> of<00:07:18.870> the<00:07:19.110> Allspark<00:07:19.740> for

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:20.190 
good representation of the Allspark for

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:23.390 
good representation of the Allspark for
the<00:07:20.340> from<00:07:21.120> the<00:07:21.240> Michael<00:07:21.630> Bay<00:07:21.780> movie<00:07:22.410> I<00:07:22.590> think

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:23.400 
the from the Michael Bay movie I think

00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:27.740 
the from the Michael Bay movie I think
this<00:07:23.730> is<00:07:23.880> the<00:07:24.000> one<00:07:24.180> again<00:07:25.880> policy<00:07:26.880> you<00:07:27.030> want<00:07:27.660> to

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:27.750 
this is the one again policy you want to

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:29.990 
this is the one again policy you want to
spend<00:07:28.020> a<00:07:28.290> few<00:07:28.860> thousand<00:07:29.370> dollars<00:07:29.670> on<00:07:29.880> the

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.000 
spend a few thousand dollars on the

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.330 
spend a few thousand dollars on the
actual<00:07:30.360> prop<00:07:30.750> used<00:07:31.140> in<00:07:31.320> the<00:07:31.410> movie<00:07:31.770> I<00:07:31.950> think

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:32.340 
actual prop used in the movie I think

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:33.980 
actual prop used in the movie I think
that's<00:07:32.520> this<00:07:32.910> is<00:07:32.970> as<00:07:33.240> close<00:07:33.450> as<00:07:33.510> you're<00:07:33.810> gonna

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:33.990 
that's this is as close as you're gonna

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:37.340 
that's this is as close as you're gonna
get<00:07:34.200> for<00:07:34.470> now<00:07:34.590> anyway<00:07:34.980> I<00:07:35.600> think<00:07:36.600> it's<00:07:36.720> pretty

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:37.350 
get for now anyway I think it's pretty

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:42.770 
get for now anyway I think it's pretty
cool<00:07:39.530> and<00:07:40.530> it's<00:07:40.770> metal<00:07:41.330> so<00:07:42.330> you<00:07:42.390> can't<00:07:42.660> go

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:42.780 
cool and it's metal so you can't go

00:07:42.780 --> 00:07:45.500 
cool and it's metal so you can't go
wrong<00:07:42.930> with<00:07:43.170> actual<00:07:43.740> metal<00:07:44.730> it's<00:07:45.060> not<00:07:45.240> plastic

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:45.510 
wrong with actual metal it's not plastic

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:50.679 
wrong with actual metal it's not plastic
so<00:07:46.050> it's<00:07:46.530> not<00:07:46.740> cheap<00:07:46.800> feeling<00:07:47.580> at<00:07:47.700> all

00:07:50.679 --> 00:07:50.689 

00:07:50.689 --> 00:07:52.879 

okay<00:07:51.689> that's<00:07:51.930> gonna<00:07:52.169> be<00:07:52.259> it

00:07:52.879 --> 00:07:52.889 
okay that's gonna be it

00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:55.969 
okay that's gonna be it
