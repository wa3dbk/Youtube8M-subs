00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.470
 that's what the Spaniard says about reading the book 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:15.269
 we want to strengthen ourselves and better insulation and did that during a concert 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.140
 he was operated on to be the people 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.670
 this is not possible and there you stay that the Spaniard has a large country 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.670
 number delivered 

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:28.380
 you would not be in danger 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.469
 Nobody was injured I don't think the baby is just with you 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:36.469
 country 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.500
 shut up the tour 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.890
 afterwards they have no time to lose with respect 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.770
 I'm right in that 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.270
 I think you are the best but I get one open 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.610
 it is not childish 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.610
 is a success compared to three thousand customers 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.230
 cyclists have to put everything on everything 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:18.900
 twenty years in the business 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.900
 it was all against it 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.120
 those chances make it difficult a Dutchman hell 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.120
 close the session 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.130
 they never get our soul
