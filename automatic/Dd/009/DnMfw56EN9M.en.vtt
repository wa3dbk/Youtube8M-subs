I<00:00:48.960> was<00:00:49.559> like<00:00:49.710> whoa<00:00:49.890> this<00:00:50.160> is<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.370> sure<00:00:50.670> bet

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
I was like whoa this is a sure bet

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.790 
I was like whoa this is a sure bet
there's<00:00:51.269> no<00:00:51.449> way<00:00:51.660> I'm<00:00:51.899> not<00:00:52.050> going<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.320> like<00:00:52.469> it

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
there's no way I'm not going to like it

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.200 
there's no way I'm not going to like it
and<00:00:53.250> have<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.329> say<00:00:54.510> I<00:00:54.690> don't<00:00:55.170> like<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:56.210> one

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
and have to say I don't like it and one

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.470 
and have to say I don't like it and one
of<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.420> reason<00:00:57.899> is<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.800> way<00:00:59.640> the<00:01:00.059> water<00:01:00.329> flows

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
of the reason is the way the water flows

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.009 
of the reason is the way the water flows
from<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:02.070> spigot<00:01:02.730> let's<00:01:03.059> just<00:01:03.359> say<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:03.750> with

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
from the spigot let's just say that with

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.910 
from the spigot let's just say that with
warm<00:01:05.060> liquid<00:01:06.320> you're<00:01:07.320> pretty<00:01:07.710> much

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
warm liquid you're pretty much

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.100 
warm liquid you're pretty much
guaranteed<00:01:08.730> to<00:01:08.760> get<00:01:09.150> burnt<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:10.940> with<00:01:12.110> cold

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
guaranteed to get burnt and with cold

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.880 
guaranteed to get burnt and with cold
liquid<00:01:13.710> it's<00:01:14.070> just<00:01:14.310> not<00:01:14.490> fast<00:01:14.790> enough<00:01:15.860> also<00:01:16.860> I

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
liquid it's just not fast enough also I

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.940 
liquid it's just not fast enough also I
think<00:01:17.550> that<00:01:17.970> they<00:01:18.210> over<00:01:18.750> engineered<00:01:19.440> this

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
think that they over engineered this

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:26.210 
think that they over engineered this
entire<00:01:22.430> device<00:01:23.430> there's<00:01:24.500> these<00:01:25.500> parts

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
entire device there's these parts

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.690 
entire device there's these parts
there's<00:01:26.900> gaskets<00:01:27.900> there's<00:01:28.640> there's<00:01:29.640> another

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
there's gaskets there's there's another

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.090 
there's gaskets there's there's another
gasket<00:01:30.210> here<00:01:30.780> there's<00:01:30.990> there's<00:01:31.620> so<00:01:31.950> many

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
gasket here there's there's so many

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.070 
gasket here there's there's so many
parts<00:01:32.520> in<00:01:32.850> this<00:01:33.060> thing<00:01:33.650> that<00:01:35.660> I'm<00:01:36.660> really<00:01:36.960> not

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
parts in this thing that I'm really not

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.010 
parts in this thing that I'm really not
sure<00:01:37.350> why<00:01:37.590> I<00:01:37.650> mean<00:01:38.390> sure<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:40.380> probably<00:01:40.650> does

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
sure why I mean sure it probably does

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.000 
sure why I mean sure it probably does
help<00:01:43.020> with<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.440> 18<00:01:44.250> hours<00:01:44.700> or<00:01:44.970> whatever<00:01:45.980> but<00:01:46.980> I

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010 
help with the 18 hours or whatever but I

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.670 
help with the 18 hours or whatever but I
do<00:01:47.160> truly<00:01:47.760> think<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.150> this<00:01:48.870> is<00:01:49.140> a<00:01:49.170> little

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
do truly think that this is a little

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.160 
do truly think that this is a little
little<00:01:49.860> over<00:01:50.340> engineered<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.150> it<00:01:51.630> possibly

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
little over engineered and it possibly

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.910 
little over engineered and it possibly
makes<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.250> really<00:01:53.580> hard<00:01:53.940> to<00:01:54.060> clean<00:01:54.620> all<00:01:55.620> these

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
makes it really hard to clean all these

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:04.040 
makes it really hard to clean all these
parts<00:01:56.610> and<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:59.300> behind<00:02:00.300> the<00:02:00.480> flap<00:02:01.040> it<00:02:02.040> just<00:02:03.050> it

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
parts and and behind the flap it just it

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.990 
parts and and behind the flap it just it
makes<00:02:04.260> it<00:02:04.440> a<00:02:04.530> real<00:02:04.770> hassle<00:02:05.010> and<00:02:05.430> I'm<00:02:05.520> really

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
makes it a real hassle and I'm really

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.499 
makes it a real hassle and I'm really
surprised<00:02:06.510> I<00:02:06.750> I<00:02:07.489> did<00:02:08.489> not<00:02:08.640> expect<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:09.300> to<00:02:09.360> be

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
surprised I I did not expect it to be

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.780 
surprised I I did not expect it to be
such<00:02:10.640> such<00:02:11.640> a<00:02:11.670> negative<00:02:12.180> experience<00:02:12.920> so<00:02:13.920> there

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
such such a negative experience so there

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.550 
such such a negative experience so there
you<00:02:14.879> go<00:02:15.060> again<00:02:15.329> I<00:02:15.390> mean<00:02:15.659> if<00:02:15.810> you<00:02:15.959> had<00:02:16.140> some<00:02:16.379> hot

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
you go again I mean if you had some hot

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.220 
you go again I mean if you had some hot
coffee

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
coffee

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.050 
coffee
some<00:02:17.530> will<00:02:17.680> get<00:02:17.860> in<00:02:18.159> there<00:02:18.430> and<00:02:18.760> you<00:02:18.909> would

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
some will get in there and you would

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.140 
some will get in there and you would
have<00:02:19.180> to<00:02:19.360> clean<00:02:19.629> it<00:02:19.659> it's<00:02:20.310> also<00:02:21.310> there's<00:02:21.819> some

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
have to clean it it's also there's some

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.330 
have to clean it it's also there's some
crevices<00:02:22.720> here<00:02:23.080> I'm<00:02:23.409> not<00:02:23.560> sure<00:02:23.769> how<00:02:23.980> you<00:02:24.040> would

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
crevices here I'm not sure how you would

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.600 
crevices here I'm not sure how you would
clean<00:02:24.580> it<00:02:24.849> if<00:02:25.000> it<00:02:25.239> did<00:02:25.599> get<00:02:25.840> dirty<00:02:26.739> this<00:02:27.549> uh

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
clean it if it did get dirty this uh

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.440 
clean it if it did get dirty this uh
this<00:02:28.330> also<00:02:28.569> this<00:02:29.019> button<00:02:29.409> is<00:02:30.209> plastic<00:02:31.209> but

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
this also this button is plastic but

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.610 
this also this button is plastic but
it's<00:02:31.599> covered<00:02:31.840> with<00:02:31.989> some<00:02:32.379> sort<00:02:32.980> of<00:02:33.040> a<00:02:33.159> metal

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
it's covered with some sort of a metal

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.539 
it's covered with some sort of a metal
now<00:02:35.620> all<00:02:36.129> these<00:02:36.519> other<00:02:37.290> models<00:02:38.290> of<00:02:38.410> the<00:02:38.920> Sochi

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
now all these other models of the Sochi

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.240 
now all these other models of the Sochi
Russia<00:02:39.819> I<00:02:40.420> hope<00:02:41.110> I'm<00:02:41.290> pronouncing<00:02:41.319> it<00:02:42.010> right

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
Russia I hope I'm pronouncing it right

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.490 
Russia I hope I'm pronouncing it right
are<00:02:42.519> about<00:02:43.329> the<00:02:43.480> same<00:02:43.690> the<00:02:44.260> only<00:02:44.319> difference

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
are about the same the only difference
