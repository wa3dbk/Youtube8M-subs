ology<00:00:37.610> secured<00:00:38.610> by<00:00:38.969> tech<00:00:39.420> 21<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:40.230> it<00:00:40.440> do<00:00:40.559> come

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
ology secured by tech 21 and it do come

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.040 
ology secured by tech 21 and it do come
with<00:00:41.040> this<00:00:41.160> material<00:00:41.570> that<00:00:42.570> they're<00:00:42.719> calling

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
with this material that they're calling

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:43.880 
with this material that they're calling
d3o

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
d3o

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.670 
d3o
so<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:44.789> should<00:00:45.120> be<00:00:45.149> very<00:00:45.300> very<00:00:45.629> impact<00:00:46.350> and

so it should be very very impact and

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.549 
so it should be very very impact and
that<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.430> absorbs<00:00:48.149> away<00:00:48.450> shocks<00:00:48.989> or<00:00:49.289> if<00:00:49.440> you

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
that it absorbs away shocks or if you
