00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.740
 unusual for the company Yandex 4007 with 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.380
 two zeros 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.080
 marked the appearance of a new car 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.460
 which extends the classic model 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.460
 row 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.460
 automaker 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.410
 concern peugeot citroen decided 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.020
 take borrowed 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.200
 partner found a platform quickly 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:53.600
 peugeot 4007 and his twin brother citroen 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.430
 c-crosser are the result 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.770
 cooperation mitsubishi motors 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.630
 corporation and peugeot citroen 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.390
 this collaboration turned out 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:04.190
 really mutually beneficial french 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.110
 SUV got a platform from 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.460
 latest generation mitsubishi 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.520
 outlander xl 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:13.130
 In return, the Japanese were given an excellent 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.520
 160 liter diesel engine 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.520
 horses 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:35.680
 just ride tractors and we drive 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.680
 french cream floor japanese no road 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.200
 we recently tested mitsubishi 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.730
 diesel outlander and 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.240
 honestly you confess this behavior 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.860
 cars on the road 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.170
 more interesting than let's say this one 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.590
 which we now have on the test car 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:06.590
 with an engine of 2 and 4 liters petrol on 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.070
 Acceleration he is not very fun 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.800
 all the same 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.080
 for such an aggressor read in two 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.580
 half tons 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:19.100
 power unit needed for more fun 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:22.220
 Do not forget about the fuel consumption at 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:25.650
 calm driving it ranges from 13 s 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:28.200
 half to 15 liters per hundred 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.200
 I think the French still brought 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.390
 some innovations in steering 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.939
 its 4007 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.239
 on the road the car behaves somehow 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:41.129
 more interesting than the same outlander on 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.790
 steering wheel something is passed i mean it doesn't 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:46.799
 so empty as in the same mitsubishi 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.859
 despite the general similarity with his 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:51.390
 Japanese donor peugeot 4007 received 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:53.640
 original appearance 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.709
 developed by peugeot design center 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.379
 French SUV is different 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:01.920
 traditional feline appearance before 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:03.959
 large predatory air intake bumper with 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.000
 chrome edging is awesome 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.409
 emblem on the hood slanted headlights 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.750
 head light 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:12.780
 and what about the cabin about what you 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.060
 are in peugeot 4007 reminds 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.159
 only the corresponding emblem on the steering wheel in 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.510
 the rest of the interior design of the French 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:22.549
 almost completely repeats 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.549
 mitsubishi outlander xl 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.190
 quick responses to steering turns and 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.739
 good reactive action make 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:35.050
 driving an SUV as easy as 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:37.330
 as if driving a subcompact 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.730
 all-wheel drive mode switching 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.069
 the transmission is designed as a convenient 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.069
 round switch between the front 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:47.200
 the seats are available in three modes before 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:49.000
 rear wheel drive front drive 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.610
 connects automatically when 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.849
 front axle slip also 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.799
 inter axle differential lock 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:59.500
 such equipment is enough to 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:00.340
 park in a snowy yard or 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.799
 climb on 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.780
 and great curb contrary proverb in 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.910
 the French who became the first pancake 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.849
 peugeot 4007 suv 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.430
 a lump did not exactly come out and proof 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:13.420
 it is a bright appearance 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.790
 high-quality trim 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.060
 good equipment and good 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.060
 controllability
