would gravity hammer thing from a halo 3
on<00:00:32.489> sandbox<00:00:33.030> forge<00:00:33.360> mode<00:00:34.190> and<00:00:36.140> then<00:00:37.140> this<00:00:37.500> is

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
on sandbox forge mode and then this is

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.150 
on sandbox forge mode and then this is
the<00:00:38.129> Sentinel<00:00:38.610> beam<00:00:38.790> of<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.329> sentinel<00:00:39.840> major

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
the Sentinel beam of a sentinel major

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.500 
the Sentinel beam of a sentinel major
it's<00:00:41.160> supposed<00:00:41.340> to<00:00:41.370> be<00:00:41.489> gold<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.090> fires<00:00:42.360> a

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
it's supposed to be gold and fires a

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.889 
it's supposed to be gold and fires a
blue<00:00:42.750> beam<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.670> never<00:00:44.670> actually<00:00:45.059> got<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.539> use

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
blue beam I never actually got to use

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.910 
blue beam I never actually got to use
one<00:00:46.230> I<00:00:46.559> can<00:00:47.219> never<00:00:47.309> find<00:00:47.670> them<00:00:47.879> wha<00:00:48.090> wha<00:00:48.890> so<00:00:49.890> uh

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
one I can never find them wha wha so uh

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.779 
one I can never find them wha wha so uh
yeah<00:00:50.670> it's<00:00:51.149> only<00:00:51.590> um<00:00:52.590> this<00:00:52.980> one<00:00:53.190> is<00:00:53.309> playable

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
is only inhale too so um I'm going to be

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.270 
is only inhale too so um I'm going to be
showing<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.399> how<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:03.229> make<00:01:04.229> some<00:01:04.710> the<00:01:05.129> honor

showing you how to make some the honor
guard<00:01:05.489> Pike<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:06.530> seven<00:01:07.530> wood<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:07.950> the

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
guard Pike the seven wood and the

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:15.770 
guard Pike the seven wood and the
Sentinel<00:01:08.700> in<00:01:09.390> major<00:01:13.070> so<00:01:14.070> um<00:01:14.540> start<00:01:15.540> with<00:01:15.689> the

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
Sentinel in major so um start with the

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.350 
Sentinel in major so um start with the
simplest<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:17.600> seven<00:01:18.600> would<00:01:19.310> so<00:01:20.360> basically

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
simplest the seven would so basically

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.140 
simplest the seven would so basically
three<00:01:21.659> pieces<00:01:24.020> very<00:01:25.020> simple<00:01:25.470> take<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.490> gray<00:01:26.880> rod

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
three pieces very simple take a gray rod

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.280 
three pieces very simple take a gray rod
like<00:01:27.360> this<00:01:27.680> take<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.710> black<00:01:28.950> one<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.220> these

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
like this take a black one of these

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.149 
like this take a black one of these
stick<00:01:31.290> it<00:01:31.409> in<00:01:31.530> like<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:33.259> put<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.290> black<00:01:34.829> stud

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
stick it in like that put a black stud

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:44.840 
stick it in like that put a black stud
on<00:01:36.890> top<00:01:37.890> of<00:01:38.100> this<00:01:40.939> so<00:01:42.320> just<00:01:43.320> like<00:01:43.409> that<00:01:43.820> take<00:01:44.820> a

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
on top of this so just like that take a

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:56.050 
on top of this so just like that take a
Spartan<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:47.360> kind<00:01:48.360> of<00:01:48.450> hold<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:49.220> just<00:01:50.220> like

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:03.110 

there<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.180> go<00:02:00.350> so<00:02:01.350> yeah<00:02:02.070> this<00:02:02.340> is<00:02:02.460> on<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.820> map

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 
there you go so yeah this is on the map

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.530 
there you go so yeah this is on the map
sandbox<00:02:03.720> and<00:02:03.900> forge<00:02:04.200> mode<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:05.490> it<00:02:05.940> works<00:02:06.480> just

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
sandbox and forge mode and it works just

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.450 
sandbox and forge mode and it works just
like<00:02:06.750> a<00:02:06.810> gravity<00:02:07.290> hammer<00:02:07.470> and<00:02:08.040> you<00:02:08.130> get<00:02:08.250> hit

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:08.460 
like a gravity hammer and you get hit

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:14.180 
like a gravity hammer and you get hit
the<00:02:08.580> golf<00:02:08.790> balls<00:02:09.030> around<00:02:10.670> so<00:02:11.670> um<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.980> the<00:02:13.980> next

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
the golf balls around so um and the next

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.740 
the golf balls around so um and the next
one<00:02:14.400> is<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:15.890> Sentinel<00:02:16.890> major<00:02:17.280> beam<00:02:17.580> well<00:02:18.360> if

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
one is the Sentinel major beam well if

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.450 
one is the Sentinel major beam well if
you<00:02:18.870> haven't<00:02:19.110> seen<00:02:19.260> my<00:02:19.380> Sentinel<00:02:19.800> video<00:02:20.100> this

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
you haven't seen my Sentinel video this

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.390 
you haven't seen my Sentinel video this
is<00:02:20.640> just<00:02:21.090> pretty<00:02:21.300> much<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:22.220> exact<00:02:23.220> same

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
is just pretty much the exact same

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.520 
is just pretty much the exact same
design<00:02:23.730> as<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.940> regular<00:02:24.360> Sentinel<00:02:24.720> beam<00:02:24.870> it's

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
design as the regular Sentinel beam it's

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.600 
design as the regular Sentinel beam it's
just<00:02:25.800> a<00:02:25.980> some<00:02:26.280> yellow<00:02:26.730> pieces<00:02:26.970> I<00:02:27.180> put<00:02:27.390> in<00:02:27.510> there

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
just a some yellow pieces I put in there

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.910 
just a some yellow pieces I put in there
so<00:02:29.960> start<00:02:30.960> with<00:02:31.020> a<00:02:32.780> gray<00:02:33.780> handle<00:02:34.200> like<00:02:34.590> this

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
so start with a gray handle like this

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:42.070 
so start with a gray handle like this
and<00:02:36.050> then<00:02:38.090> then<00:02:39.090> take<00:02:39.390> a<00:02:39.980> yellow<00:02:40.980> one<00:02:41.100> of<00:02:41.220> these

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
and then then take a yellow one of these

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:50.480 
and then then take a yellow one of these
stick<00:02:43.080> this<00:02:43.230> down<00:02:43.440> here<00:02:44.660> just<00:02:45.660> like<00:02:45.870> that<00:02:49.490> then

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
stick this down here just like that then

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:55.790 
stick this down here just like that then
take<00:02:50.790> one<00:02:51.290> of<00:02:52.290> these<00:02:53.959> stick<00:02:54.959> that<00:02:54.990> right<00:02:55.410> on

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
take one of these stick that right on

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.580 
take one of these stick that right on
there<00:02:57.140> like<00:02:58.140> that<00:02:59.750> then<00:03:00.750> take<00:03:00.989> a<00:03:01.020> yellow<00:03:01.350> bar

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
there like that then take a yellow bar

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.520 
there like that then take a yellow bar
piece<00:03:01.830> stick<00:03:02.610> it<00:03:02.700> on<00:03:02.820> there<00:03:05.209> so<00:03:06.209> fits<00:03:06.989> on<00:03:07.200> the

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
piece stick it on there so fits on the

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.690
