someone<00:00:08.820> else<00:00:09.000> has<00:00:09.120> done<00:00:09.150> it<00:00:09.330> wave<00:00:09.599> for<00:00:09.840> I<00:00:09.870> have

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
someone else has done it wave for I have

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.450 
someone else has done it wave for I have
probably<00:00:10.620> around<00:00:10.830> when<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.160> legacy

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
probably around when the legacy

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.299 
probably around when the legacy
collection<00:00:11.580> was<00:00:11.880> out<00:00:12.000> also<00:00:12.840> that<00:00:13.290> was<00:00:14.160> around

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
collection was out also that was around

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.740 
collection was out also that was around
the<00:00:14.460> time<00:00:14.490> these<00:00:14.849> two<00:00:15.000> figures<00:00:15.179> were<00:00:15.509> first

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
the time these two figures were first

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.080 
the time these two figures were first
released<00:00:16.010> so<00:00:17.010> anyways<00:00:17.340> for<00:00:17.490> materials<00:00:17.970> you're

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
released so anyways for materials you're

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.490 
released so anyways for materials you're
going<00:00:18.210> to<00:00:18.270> need<00:00:18.359> one<00:00:18.390> Jeremy<00:00:18.930> Colton<00:00:19.260> figure

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
going to need one Jeremy Colton figure

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.470 
going to need one Jeremy Colton figure
from<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.859> legacy<00:00:20.160> collection<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:20.760> one

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
from the legacy collection and one

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.390 
from the legacy collection and one
legacy<00:00:21.779> Boba<00:00:22.050> Fett<00:00:22.289> with<00:00:22.769> removable<00:00:23.279> helmet

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
legacy Boba Fett with removable helmet

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.529 
legacy Boba Fett with removable helmet
and<00:00:25.010> to<00:00:26.010> make<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.220> custom<00:00:26.550> figure<00:00:26.910> I'll<00:00:27.300> what

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
and to make the custom figure I'll what

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.140 
and to make the custom figure I'll what
to<00:00:27.779> do<00:00:27.900> is<00:00:28.109> swap<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.410> heads<00:00:28.590> and<00:00:28.880> as<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:30.029> can

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
to do is swap the heads and as you can

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.510 
to do is swap the heads and as you can
see<00:00:30.179> there<00:00:31.080> is<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.260> slight<00:00:31.679> difference<00:00:31.740> in<00:00:32.279> size

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
see there is a slight difference in size

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.319 
see there is a slight difference in size
with<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.940> ball<00:00:33.120> joint<00:00:33.360> so<00:00:34.820> both<00:00:35.820> that's<00:00:36.120> is

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
with the ball joint so both that's is

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.900 
with the ball joint so both that's is
bigger<00:00:37.489> so<00:00:38.489> putting<00:00:38.760> on<00:00:39.320> Jeremy's<00:00:40.320> head<00:00:40.910> might

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
bigger so putting on Jeremy's head might

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.490 
bigger so putting on Jeremy's head might
be<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.030> bit<00:00:42.180> troublesome<00:00:42.540> so<00:00:42.989> what<00:00:43.140> you<00:00:43.260> can<00:00:43.379> do

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
be a bit troublesome so what you can do

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.770 
be a bit troublesome so what you can do
here<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:43.920> dip<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.460> head<00:00:44.610> inside<00:00:45.120> hot<00:00:45.539> water

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
here is dip the head inside hot water

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.869 
here is dip the head inside hot water
and<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.829> will<00:00:46.920> soften<00:00:47.100> up<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.309> plastic<00:00:47.520> and

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
and that will soften up the plastic and

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.630 
and that will soften up the plastic and
make<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.059> easier<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.420> put<00:00:48.750> on<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.020> ball<00:00:49.170> joint

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:49.640 
make it easier to put on the ball joint

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.950 
make it easier to put on the ball joint
however<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:50.879> possible<00:00:51.590> to<00:00:52.590> attach<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.280> head

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
however is possible to attach the head

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.189 
however is possible to attach the head
without<00:00:54.960> using<00:00:55.320> hot<00:00:55.590> water<00:00:56.690> so<00:00:57.690> here<00:00:58.050> he<00:00:58.140> is

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
without using hot water so here he is

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.830 
without using hot water so here he is
Jerry<00:00:58.710> Bullock<00:00:59.070> as<00:00:59.219> Boba<00:00:59.670> Fett<00:00:59.850> so<00:01:00.449> really

brilliant<00:01:05.519> where<00:01:05.939> we<00:01:06.060> came<00:01:06.210> up<00:01:06.240> with<00:01:06.450> this

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
brilliant where we came up with this

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.530 
brilliant where we came up with this
idea<00:01:06.770> but<00:01:07.770> uh<00:01:07.799> yeah<00:01:08.430> very<00:01:08.729> easy<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.210> simple<00:01:09.360> to

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
idea but uh yeah very easy and simple to

so<00:01:13.740> yeah<00:01:13.920> I<00:01:14.540> really<00:01:15.540> think<00:01:15.750> Hasbro<00:01:16.170> should<00:01:16.640> do

so yeah I really think Hasbro should do

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.149 
so yeah I really think Hasbro should do
a<00:01:18.000> behind<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.810> scenes<00:01:19.080> finger<00:01:19.530> series<00:01:19.890> or<00:01:20.130> a
