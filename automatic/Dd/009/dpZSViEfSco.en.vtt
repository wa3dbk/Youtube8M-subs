hey guys so here I just wanted to give
you<00:00:06.529> a<00:00:06.589> little<00:00:06.799> shot<00:00:07.279> of<00:00:07.549> how<00:00:08.240> I<00:00:08.269> changed<00:00:09.139> the

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:09.460 
you a little shot of how I changed the

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.820 
you a little shot of how I changed the
Zeo<00:00:10.460> nines<00:00:10.960> shifting<00:00:11.960> from<00:00:12.230> the<00:00:12.379> standard

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:12.830 
Zeo nines shifting from the standard

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:14.770 
Zeo nines shifting from the standard
shifting<00:00:13.280> which<00:00:13.549> is<00:00:13.790> I<00:00:13.820> think<00:00:14.480> if<00:00:14.599> I<00:00:14.719> remember

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:14.780 
shifting which is I think if I remember

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.660 
shifting which is I think if I remember
right<00:00:15.820> it's<00:00:16.820> like<00:00:17.360> one<00:00:17.960> down<00:00:18.200> and<00:00:18.530> five<00:00:18.740> up<00:00:19.010> to

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:19.670 
right it's like one down and five up to

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.700 
right it's like one down and five up to
the<00:00:19.790> GP<00:00:20.180> shifting<00:00:20.630> which<00:00:20.840> is<00:00:21.020> one<00:00:21.230> up<00:00:21.410> five

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
the GP shifting which is one up five

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.890 
the GP shifting which is one up five
down<00:00:22.150> l<00:00:23.150> was<00:00:23.330> having<00:00:23.540> a<00:00:23.570> little<00:00:23.630> bit<00:00:23.810> of

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
down l was having a little bit of

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.270 
down l was having a little bit of
problems<00:00:24.230> with<00:00:24.410> it<00:00:24.560> when<00:00:24.710> she<00:00:24.890> drove<00:00:25.070> it<00:00:25.220> at

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:25.280 
problems with it when she drove it at

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.340 
problems with it when she drove it at
home<00:00:25.370> yesterday<00:00:25.610> so<00:00:26.480> I<00:00:26.510> figured<00:00:26.960> I'd<00:00:27.050> just<00:00:27.200> do

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:27.350 
home yesterday so I figured I'd just do

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:28.540 
home yesterday so I figured I'd just do
this<00:00:27.500> real<00:00:27.680> fast<00:00:27.860> that<00:00:28.190> took<00:00:28.370> me<00:00:28.490> a<00:00:28.520> couple

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
this real fast that took me a couple

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:29.740 
this real fast that took me a couple
minutes<00:00:28.880> to<00:00:29.210> do<00:00:29.330> this

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
minutes to do this

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.049 
minutes to do this
to<00:00:30.410> figure<00:00:30.590> out<00:00:30.710> what<00:00:30.800> I<00:00:30.830> was<00:00:30.950> going<00:00:31.070> to<00:00:31.100> do<00:00:31.310> but

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:32.059 
to figure out what I was going to do but

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:33.459 
to figure out what I was going to do but
when<00:00:32.239> I<00:00:32.270> got<00:00:32.480> started<00:00:32.719> it<00:00:33.019> probably<00:00:33.289> took<00:00:33.350> in

00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:33.469 
when I got started it probably took in

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:36.160 
when I got started it probably took in
about<00:00:33.589> 45<00:00:34.070> minutes<00:00:34.100> total<00:00:34.789> time<00:00:34.969> might<00:00:35.960> take<00:00:36.140> a

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
about 45 minutes total time might take a

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.479 
about 45 minutes total time might take a
little<00:00:36.289> bit<00:00:36.410> longer<00:00:36.620> depending<00:00:36.890> what<00:00:37.250> tools

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
little bit longer depending what tools

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:39.040 
little bit longer depending what tools
you<00:00:37.640> have<00:00:37.850> but<00:00:38.390> I<00:00:38.420> just<00:00:38.570> want<00:00:38.839> to<00:00:38.870> show<00:00:38.989> you

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
you have but I just want to show you

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.079 
you have but I just want to show you

00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:43.519 
and what I did was I kind of notched out

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:46.000 
and what I did was I kind of notched out
that<00:00:43.940> thing<00:00:44.899> there<00:00:45.140> I<00:00:45.170> don't<00:00:45.469> even<00:00:45.559> tell<00:00:45.920> us

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
that thing there I don't even tell us

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.000 
that thing there I don't even tell us
call<00:00:46.249> before<00:00:46.699> the<00:00:46.850> rear<00:00:47.420> set<00:00:47.659> and<00:00:47.929> I<00:00:48.739> kind<00:00:48.980> of

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
call before the rear set and I kind of

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:50.860 
call before the rear set and I kind of
put<00:00:49.219> a<00:00:49.249> little<00:00:49.309> you<00:00:50.059> know<00:00:50.149> cut<00:00:50.390> in<00:00:50.539> it<00:00:50.659> so<00:00:50.780> I<00:00:50.839> can

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
put a little you know cut in it so I can

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.360 
put a little you know cut in it so I can
go<00:00:51.050> back<00:00:51.260> and<00:00:51.440> forth<00:00:51.649> and<00:00:51.829> still<00:00:52.069> have<00:00:52.219> my

go back and forth and still have my

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.709 
go back and forth and still have my
adjustment<00:00:52.909> on<00:00:52.969> my<00:00:53.089> rock<00:00:53.269> because<00:00:53.480> I<00:00:53.569> haven't

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 
adjustment on my rock because I haven't

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:56.410 
adjustment on my rock because I haven't
adjusted<00:00:53.929> the<00:00:54.409> the<00:00:55.280> pedal<00:00:55.640> to<00:00:55.670> the<00:00:56.030> way<00:00:56.149> I<00:00:56.179> like

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
adjusted the the pedal to the way I like

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.139 
adjusted the the pedal to the way I like
it<00:00:56.600> yet<00:00:56.809> basically<00:00:57.499> what<00:00:57.739> I<00:00:57.769> did<00:00:58.010> was<00:00:58.280> I<00:00:58.640> took<00:00:58.729> a

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:01.519 
little boat there that you see running

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:04.440 
little boat there that you see running
here<00:01:01.879> took<00:01:02.569> that<00:01:02.809> out<00:01:02.839> took<00:01:03.469> the<00:01:03.679> shifter<00:01:04.190> tool

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:04.450 
here took that out took the shifter tool

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.360 
here took that out took the shifter tool
bracket<00:01:05.450> off<00:01:05.600> and<00:01:05.870> then<00:01:06.560> I<00:01:06.620> took<00:01:06.680> the<00:01:06.860> sprocket

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:07.370 
bracket off and then I took the sprocket

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:08.830 
bracket off and then I took the sprocket
cover<00:01:07.400> off<00:01:07.760> just<00:01:08.030> to<00:01:08.150> give<00:01:08.300> me<00:01:08.450> a<00:01:08.480> little<00:01:08.690> bit

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
cover off just to give me a little bit

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.320 
cover off just to give me a little bit
more<00:01:09.020> room<00:01:09.260> and<00:01:09.560> then<00:01:10.520> what<00:01:10.670> I<00:01:10.700> did<00:01:10.970> was<00:01:11.150> I<00:01:11.180> took

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
more room and then what I did was I took

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.460 
more room and then what I did was I took
my<00:01:11.540> tools<00:01:11.990> here

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
my tools here

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.370 
my tools here
I<00:01:12.500> took<00:01:12.710> a<00:01:12.890> punch<00:01:13.250> and<00:01:13.580> a<00:01:14.150> hammer<00:01:14.180> and<00:01:14.720> I<00:01:15.170> kind

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
I took a punch and a hammer and I kind

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.660 
I took a punch and a hammer and I kind
of<00:01:15.440> ballpark<00:01:15.800> like<00:01:16.070> where<00:01:16.250> I<00:01:16.280> was<00:01:16.340> gonna<00:01:16.550> have

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
of ballpark like where I was gonna have

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.880 
of ballpark like where I was gonna have
the<00:01:16.970> rod<00:01:17.150> and<00:01:17.480> I<00:01:17.690> put<00:01:17.900> a<00:01:17.930> little<00:01:18.110> dent<00:01:18.350> in<00:01:18.530> it<00:01:18.650> so

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
the rod and I put a little dent in it so

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.410 
the rod and I put a little dent in it so
that<00:01:19.070> my<00:01:19.190> drill<00:01:19.460> wouldn't<00:01:19.670> walk<00:01:19.880> on<00:01:20.090> me<00:01:20.240> and

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
that my drill wouldn't walk on me and

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.350 
that my drill wouldn't walk on me and
then<00:01:21.170> I<00:01:21.230> took<00:01:21.290> a<00:01:21.530> smaller<00:01:21.920> drill<00:01:22.580> to<00:01:23.000> start<00:01:23.270> the

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
then I took a smaller drill to start the

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.400 
then I took a smaller drill to start the
pilot<00:01:23.540> hole<00:01:23.840> right<00:01:23.990> there

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:24.410 
pilot hole right there

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.230 
pilot hole right there
made<00:01:25.070> the<00:01:25.220> hole<00:01:25.400> that<00:01:25.700> I<00:01:25.820> went<00:01:26.030> with<00:01:26.120> the

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
made the hole that I went with the

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.110 
made the hole that I went with the
larger<00:01:26.570> one<00:01:26.720> and<00:01:27.200> put<00:01:27.920> a<00:01:27.950> hole<00:01:28.190> in<00:01:28.370> it<00:01:28.520> it<00:01:28.790> looks

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.120 
larger one and put a hole in it it looks

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.670 
larger one and put a hole in it it looks
like<00:01:29.240> I<00:01:29.330> might<00:01:29.480> have<00:01:29.630> went<00:01:29.780> a<00:01:29.840> little<00:01:30.110> too<00:01:30.290> far

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
like I might have went a little too far

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.480 
like I might have went a little too far
in<00:01:30.890> but<00:01:31.310> they<00:01:31.970> don't<00:01:32.180> matter<00:01:32.890> but<00:01:33.890> so<00:01:34.190> the<00:01:34.280> hole

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
in but they don't matter but so the hole

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.700 
in but they don't matter but so the hole
was<00:01:34.670> done<00:01:34.910> and<00:01:35.240> then<00:01:35.390> at<00:01:35.480> that<00:01:35.660> point<00:01:35.930> I<00:01:36.230> took

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
was done and then at that point I took

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.460 
was done and then at that point I took
my<00:01:36.860> grinding<00:01:37.280> wheel<00:01:37.460> here<00:01:37.930> and<00:01:38.930> I<00:01:39.170> went<00:01:39.380> ahead

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
my grinding wheel here and I went ahead

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.620 
my grinding wheel here and I went ahead
and<00:01:39.770> just<00:01:39.920> cut<00:01:40.160> straight<00:01:40.520> to<00:01:40.790> kind<00:01:41.270> of<00:01:41.300> line<00:01:41.480> it

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
and just cut straight to kind of line it

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.210 
and just cut straight to kind of line it
up<00:01:41.690> with<00:01:41.900> the<00:01:42.050> hole<00:01:42.230> that<00:01:42.380> I<00:01:42.530> had<00:01:42.650> drilled<00:01:42.950> and

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
up with the hole that I had drilled and

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.480 
up with the hole that I had drilled and
then<00:01:43.850> I<00:01:43.940> took<00:01:44.000> my<00:01:44.270> arm<00:01:45.190> the<00:01:46.190> hell<00:01:46.310> this<00:01:46.430> thing

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
then I took my arm the hell this thing

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.700 
then I took my arm the hell this thing
was<00:01:46.760> called<00:01:47.030> but<00:01:47.480> I<00:01:47.750> kind<00:01:48.200> of<00:01:48.230> used<00:01:48.440> that<00:01:48.560> to

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
was called but I kind of used that to

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.710 
was called but I kind of used that to
kind<00:01:48.890> of<00:01:48.950> clean<00:01:49.190> everything<00:01:49.550> up<00:01:49.730> and<00:01:50.210> kind<00:01:50.660> of

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
kind of clean everything up and kind of

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.240 
kind of clean everything up and kind of
get<00:01:50.870> everything<00:01:51.080> all<00:01:51.380> rounded<00:01:51.800> and<00:01:51.980> smooth

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
get everything all rounded and smooth

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.100 
get everything all rounded and smooth
and<00:01:52.430> stuff<00:01:52.700> so<00:01:53.240> that<00:01:53.420> the<00:01:53.630> shift<00:01:53.990> linkage

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
and stuff so that the shift linkage

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.690 
and stuff so that the shift linkage
could<00:01:54.530> fit<00:01:54.710> in<00:01:54.800> there<00:01:54.980> real<00:01:55.130> nice<00:01:55.310> I<00:01:55.610> don't

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
could fit in there real nice I don't

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.690 
could fit in there real nice I don't
know<00:01:55.970> if<00:01:56.030> it'll<00:01:56.500> there<00:01:57.500> you<00:01:57.620> go<00:01:57.770> looks<00:01:58.640> a

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
know if it'll there you go looks a

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.730 
know if it'll there you go looks a
little<00:01:58.790> bit<00:01:58.970> better<00:01:59.120> but<00:01:59.900> basically<00:02:00.560> that's

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
little bit better but basically that's

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.260 
little bit better but basically that's
all<00:02:00.860> I<00:02:00.920> did<00:02:01.190> I<00:02:01.220> didn't<00:02:01.610> want<00:02:01.790> to<00:02:01.850> go<00:02:01.970> the<00:02:02.090> route

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
all I did I didn't want to go the route

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.120 
all I did I didn't want to go the route
of<00:02:02.300> bending<00:02:02.750> the<00:02:02.870> shift<00:02:03.140> lever<00:02:03.320> or<00:02:03.680> the<00:02:03.740> shift

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
of bending the shift lever or the shift

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.070 
of bending the shift lever or the shift
rod<00:02:04.670> because<00:02:05.330> that<00:02:05.510> was<00:02:05.630> going<00:02:05.750> to<00:02:05.870> be<00:02:05.930> too

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
rod because that was going to be too

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.169 
rod because that was going to be too
much<00:02:06.230> of<00:02:06.290> a<00:02:06.500> band<00:02:06.770> and<00:02:07.040> I<00:02:07.460> really<00:02:07.730> couldn't<00:02:08.000> see

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
much of a band and I really couldn't see

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.330 
much of a band and I really couldn't see
any<00:02:08.360> other<00:02:08.569> way<00:02:08.810> of<00:02:09.200> doing<00:02:09.499> it<00:02:09.769> because<00:02:10.069> of<00:02:10.249> the

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
any other way of doing it because of the

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.800 
any other way of doing it because of the
way<00:02:10.519> the

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
way the

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.900 
way the
the<00:02:12.110> things<00:02:12.350> configured<00:02:12.920> so<00:02:13.400> this<00:02:13.580> is<00:02:13.670> kind<00:02:13.850> of

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
the things configured so this is kind of

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.430 
the things configured so this is kind of
the<00:02:14.000> route<00:02:14.150> I<00:02:14.330> went<00:02:14.600> I<00:02:14.750> have<00:02:14.870> road<00:02:15.050> tested<00:02:15.380> the

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
the route I went I have road tested the

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.900 
the route I went I have road tested the
bike<00:02:15.590> yet<00:02:15.800> to<00:02:15.890> fine<00:02:16.100> tune<00:02:16.130> it<00:02:16.460> but<00:02:16.670> that's

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
bike yet to fine tune it but that's

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:17.770 
bike yet to fine tune it but that's
pretty<00:02:17.150> much<00:02:17.270> it

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
pretty much it

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.450 
pretty much it
just<00:02:18.140> one<00:02:18.320> quick<00:02:18.500> suggestion<00:02:19.010> when<00:02:19.160> you<00:02:19.250> put

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
just one quick suggestion when you put

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.400 
just one quick suggestion when you put
the<00:02:19.550> lever<00:02:19.760> back<00:02:20.060> in<00:02:20.270> put<00:02:20.870> a<00:02:20.900> little<00:02:21.110> dab<00:02:21.380> of

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
the lever back in put a little dab of

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.370 
the lever back in put a little dab of
blue<00:02:21.770> silicon<00:02:22.430> or<00:02:22.610> not<00:02:22.970> silicon<00:02:23.420> you<00:02:24.080> can<00:02:24.110> use

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
blue silicon or not silicon you can use

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.960 
blue silicon or not silicon you can use
silicon<00:02:24.830> but<00:02:25.100> you<00:02:25.340> know<00:02:25.460> on<00:02:25.520> the<00:02:25.580> end<00:02:25.790> of<00:02:25.880> the

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
silicon but you know on the end of the

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.940 
silicon but you know on the end of the
thread<00:02:26.180> or<00:02:26.330> whatever<00:02:26.570> to<00:02:26.720> hold<00:02:26.900> it<00:02:27.020> but<00:02:27.200> I<00:02:27.410> use

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
thread or whatever to hold it but I use

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.670 
thread or whatever to hold it but I use
a<00:02:27.980> blue<00:02:28.490> loctite<00:02:29.090> on<00:02:29.600> the<00:02:29.840> threads<00:02:30.140> and<00:02:30.410> then<00:02:30.560> I

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
a blue loctite on the threads and then I

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.500 
a blue loctite on the threads and then I
torque<00:02:30.950> it<00:02:31.070> to<00:02:31.160> whatever<00:02:31.340> the<00:02:31.580> spec<00:02:31.850> is<00:02:32.060> your

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
torque it to whatever the spec is your

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.660 
torque it to whatever the spec is your
bikes<00:02:32.720> would<00:02:32.840> be<00:02:32.959> different<00:02:33.430> but<00:02:34.430> that's

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:34.670 
bikes would be different but that's

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.550 
bikes would be different but that's
pretty<00:02:34.850> much<00:02:34.970> it<00:02:35.120> that's<00:02:35.510> how<00:02:35.630> I<00:02:35.660> did<00:02:35.810> the<00:02:36.080> f09

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
pretty much it that's how I did the f09

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.710 
pretty much it that's how I did the f09
I'll<00:02:37.280> back<00:02:37.490> up<00:02:37.520> a<00:02:37.790> little<00:02:37.880> bit<00:02:38.090> so<00:02:38.240> you<00:02:38.360> can<00:02:38.390> see

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
I'll back up a little bit so you can see

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.220 
I'll back up a little bit so you can see
it<00:02:38.840> and<00:02:39.940> that<00:02:40.940> was<00:02:41.090> it<00:02:41.270> it<00:02:41.300> was<00:02:41.510> simple<00:02:41.870> if<00:02:42.080> you

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
it and that was it it was simple if you

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.020 
it and that was it it was simple if you
have<00:02:42.260> a<00:02:42.440> dremel<00:02:42.950> or<00:02:43.310> any<00:02:43.520> other<00:02:43.700> kind<00:02:43.940> of

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
have a dremel or any other kind of

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.300 
have a dremel or any other kind of
cordless<00:02:44.300> tools<00:02:45.230> might<00:02:45.860> take<00:02:46.040> a<00:02:46.070> little<00:02:46.220> bit

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
cordless tools might take a little bit

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.830 
cordless tools might take a little bit
longer<00:02:46.489> because<00:02:46.850> these<00:02:47.000> air<00:02:47.239> tools<00:02:47.510> right

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
longer because these air tools right

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.430 
longer because these air tools right
here<00:02:47.900> they<00:02:48.140> cook<00:02:48.320> pretty<00:02:48.470> fast<00:02:49.420> but<00:02:50.440> it's

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
here they cook pretty fast but it's

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.440 
here they cook pretty fast but it's
pretty<00:02:51.739> much<00:02:51.830> easy<00:02:52.040> so<00:02:52.400> that's<00:02:52.760> all<00:02:53.030> I<00:02:53.060> got<00:02:53.330> to

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
pretty much easy so that's all I got to

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.560 
pretty much easy so that's all I got to
say<00:02:53.480> and<00:02:53.959> thanks<00:02:54.920> for<00:02:55.040> watching<00:02:55.100> and<00:02:55.910> hope<00:02:56.540> you

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
say and thanks for watching and hope you

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:05.960 
say and thanks for watching and hope you
enjoy<00:02:57.020> all<00:02:57.410> the<00:02:57.560> bits

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.030 

you
