00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.000
 notice the plan from the frontis the evil 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.429
 contains essential fatty acids 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:27.460
 it's called essential because it's essential 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.140
 that come with the food 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.759
 your body can not produce 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.150
 The function of these oils is to maintain 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.310
 and recover the elasticity of the skin and in general of all tissues 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.650
 they are called essential 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.740
 we already did because it can not form and our traditional food 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.970
 have deficiencies of these oils 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:53.310
 then high valley roses complained about the program 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.430
 all your tissues start to recover 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.110
 the normal stigma and that includes the skin 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.530
 and everything else tissues 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.940
 then as weight is lost 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.060
 adn the skin is adjusted to the body to say 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.060
 they can not operate france 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.300
 There have also been many people who have problems with circulation 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.220
 other people bought hemorrhoids or varicose veins start to get better because 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.720
 the veins that were once the ideas 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.750
 they regain their elasticity in the essential oils in beginning the vitamin it 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:27.920
 they form queues and they do not 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.090
 and that is used 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.969
 especially the tissues 

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:32.620
 next point 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.310
 It prevents illnesses 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.840
 It prevents illnesses 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.870
 we said in the previous day bhatti the traditional food 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.980
 it came with excesses 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.880
 shortcomings 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.890
 Poor feeding look good in increments 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.020
 it is only corrected with food supplements 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.800
 that contain 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.880
 proteins 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:01.399
 essential oils fiber vitamins minerals and fig elements together with 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:04.820
 botanical factors bad 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.759
 all these nutrients allow us to have a full invitation 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:10.779
 for good 

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:15.259
 the bull is something athletes or athletes know very well but people 

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:16.539
 like one 

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:19.939
 ordinary people know that even if he is not an athlete 

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:22.939
 it also comes to supplement your diet 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:28.060
 few tiger people it is understood that interesting few people can anyone 

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:32.489
 name the 114 basic nutrients that I got for that appointment 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:36.089
 every when every day 

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:39.420
 and it is very rare that he knows the amount 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.660
 from each of them 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.660
 and much less where are they 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:48.219
 since last night in this 

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:51.559
 if we do not know it was tremendously quoted 

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:53.869
 we will not be able to choose what 

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:55.439
 the food 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:58.659
 containing those increments 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:00.480
 Well what can people really 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.400
 is facing a good food supplement does not know how to identify it 

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:06.409
 in a wildcard 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:08.079
 abc that many doctors 

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:09.820
 it does not owe fair value 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.209
 to a good food supplement 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:13.449
 Iran 

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:16.939
 are those are vitamins I do not think I do not think I get 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:19.950
 nobody knows what it's called 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.950
 18 carat puritite ignorance 

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:27.489
 is ignorance about the nutrients are needs 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.150
 daily if you owe us the amount of nutrients we need and the 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.119
 amount that contains each food 

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:36.909
 we can not know what 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:39.469
 what amount element should we take 

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:40.659
 it was understood 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:41.949
 so 

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:46.999
 because of this people do not know and food to catch and what to avoid 

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:52.369
 jara consequently receives 1 excess nutrients and others with 

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:54.049
 deficiencies now 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:57.759
 that will be enough to cause you many diseases 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:01.370
 weight problems and finally 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.419
 spend a lot of money on doctors 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:07.260
 medicines hospitalizations and spark plugs and maybe 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.839
 even have a premature death 

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:12.349
 the proposal the solution 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:15.349
 supplements or nutritional supplements 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:18.169
 that contain 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:21.799
 botanical factors oligoelements vitamins minerals proteins 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:26.059
 Whistleblowers 

00:04:26.059 --> 00:04:28.439
 good next point 

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:31.390
 contains necessary nutrients nothing 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.430
 the 114 basic nutrients that are 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:39.400
 from water oxygen fiber simple carbohydrates and complex saturated fat and 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.309
 polyunsaturated oil 

00:04:41.309 --> 00:04:43.610
 vitamins that are 16 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.819
 my idea is that they are real 

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:50.590
 aviñoa cio that are 22 and that elements that are 60 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.809
 who tells me 

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:54.830
 60 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.219
 next point 

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:58.460
 It is easy to digest and absorb 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.840
 nothing contains protein in the soybean and the protein there that farce has 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:03.999
 demonstrated 

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:07.920
 in recent days indicated that it is the protein that best protects 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.039
 look closely at the mucosa the digestive tract 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:12.309
 next point 

00:05:12.309 --> 00:05:13.839
 it is not a diet 

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:17.749
 it's not an age that we wanted such diets with the problem they had to 

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:19.449
 subsistence allowance 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:21.569
 you do not always see what 

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:22.430
 ass bush 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:23.589
 now 

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:27.909
 finally they last from one to three weeks appointment twenty-one days barak are made with 

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:28.639
 foods 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:31.919
 what note in proteins such as water does not bring anything 

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:34.669
 Santa Fe 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:35.970
 salads 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:36.870
 One gram 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.499
 we all play 

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:40.909
 what happens but protein with food 

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:42.419
 the organism 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:44.310
 take the ones that are missing from your 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:45.330
 bokova 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.569
 the opening of doors 

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:50.930
 for example a person loses six kilos dared to put 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:52.940
 four are really 2 11 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:53.900
 ass bush 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.830
 sting test commented 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.050
 that the muscle 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:59.059
 stgo burning fat burning 

00:05:59.059 --> 00:06:00.509
 when missing muscle 

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:03.559
 more easily fatten up harder than 

00:06:03.559 --> 00:06:05.210
 low pressure 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.240
 you hear the typical phrase 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.400
 it's weird 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:13.310
 before dinner when I went down for fatih simó abc or three months has not gone down a 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:14.180
 gram 

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.879
 for idesa 

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:17.990
 and that is the reason 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.830
 not only are there people who do not go down but who joined the diet because their mood 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.279
 store that 

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:24.839
 more fat 

00:06:24.839 --> 00:06:26.949
 they have known cases like this 

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:28.400
 it's typical 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.979
 and a litle more 

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:31.289
 this program 

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:34.999
 is designed so that the person only remains that thank you 

00:06:34.999 --> 00:06:38.080
 and for no reason lose muscle 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:38.770
 no water
