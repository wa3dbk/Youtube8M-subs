eventually the game was just cancelled

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.030 
eventually the game was just cancelled
due<00:03:09.730> to<00:03:09.820> a<00:03:09.850> lack<00:03:10.090> of<00:03:10.120> focus<00:03:10.450> and<00:03:10.870> design<00:03:11.170> that

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
due to a lack of focus and design that

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.310 
due to a lack of focus and design that
kind<00:03:12.700> of<00:03:12.820> makes<00:03:13.000> sense<00:03:13.120> though<00:03:13.600> I<00:03:13.630> mean<00:03:13.900> the

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
kind of makes sense though I mean the

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.110 
kind of makes sense though I mean the
game<00:03:14.500> started<00:03:14.890> off<00:03:15.010> as<00:03:15.220> Donkey<00:03:15.670> Kong<00:03:15.880> Racing

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
game started off as Donkey Kong Racing

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.870 
game started off as Donkey Kong Racing
as<00:03:16.570> the<00:03:16.990> name<00:03:17.140> implies<00:03:17.470> a<00:03:17.830> racing<00:03:18.340> title<00:03:18.700> but

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
as the name implies a racing title but

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.640 
as the name implies a racing title but
slowly<00:03:19.270> its<00:03:19.690> focus<00:03:20.080> shifted<00:03:20.410> away<00:03:20.530> from

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
slowly its focus shifted away from

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.010 
slowly its focus shifted away from
Donkey<00:03:21.250> Kong<00:03:21.430> and<00:03:21.730> eventually<00:03:22.540> racing<00:03:22.930> as
