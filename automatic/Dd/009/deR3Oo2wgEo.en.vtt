00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.639
 hello my name is toni were mine 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.309
 bachelor in applied computer science 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.950
 the last seven days were unfortunately 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.210
 not really bachelor freak me 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.800
 has barely been in the last seven days 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.210
 Not only my bachelor 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.039
 do it but you do not know it yet 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.109
 just finished by the way 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.850
 must and that is component-based 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.500
 Development I have that way to myself 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.750
 pushed because I always found it stupid 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.890
 but it has to be done by and with it 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.269
 now the last week one more 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.030
 Do not have to do project task 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.250
 was allowed to give and learned and now 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.559
 I'm coming straight out, so to speak 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.040
 exam which was somehow funny 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.170
 well examinations in which everything may use 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.329
 are always kind of weird but yes 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.250
 Therefore, there is not such a cool 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.629
 video today but only here are the 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.100
 cheap and it was already dark and 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.170
 all shit is heard from the motto 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.860
 oversteer and one truck schoonhoven 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.860
 Sometimes it happens like that 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.800
 I'm sorry but hey I still have 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.180
 theoretically made a bit of time if 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.690
 I could program and that too 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:08.030
 already firmly and that the first attempts 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.220
 one of a planning claims had 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.259
 all screens and functions of the 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.479
 single screens in the factory game 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:16.310
 recorded so I know what I mean 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.610
 wants to go a bit quiet out 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.190
 does not want to be funny with music 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.750
 Implementing old is only nice if 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.000
 one says at work where should i go 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:30.190
 must yes if you leave in the prototype 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.880
 and there is no typical I can all 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.009
 You can implement it in time 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.429
 now four weeks time and there you have to 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.899
 you design yes so he speak 

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:40.880
 as a programmer is a pity though 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:42.170
 you want to do it and see it on paper 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.729
 the whole diagrams a bit more 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.880
 stupid because I only have now 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.080
 so screens painted one can yes one 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:53.060
 Software from different 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:55.340
 see perspectives ago and gives the 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.470
 beautiful language clock male the 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.149
 Hate learned to use anyway 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.649
 must and so a bit 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:03.680
 support but who this book 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.420
 bought very thin and there are up to date 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.590
 In a nutshell you should 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.299
 only well if you already know and 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.090
 hummels if you do not want that 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:11.690
 my classes were extremely redeemed 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.120
 has been 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.370
 But what happens to the book ? 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.540
 now how to deal with and from it beautiful 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.010
 build models for my software with it 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.780
 the people who do it for me 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.480
 to make it known 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.500
 yes, that one guy there he does it all anyway 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.120
 programmed 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.470
 I hope that I am in the 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.100
 a little something anyway next week 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.100
 can program 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.280
 because so many have reported the 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.910
 a website or an editor 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.560
 want to program I thought something 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.030
 are you doing fast times in the forum so 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.130
 places forum founded 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.660
 link in the video description domain 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.920
 does not offer much shit from her yet 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.989
 can sign up and you have 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.709
 really right community forums where you 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.150
 can exchange 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.670
 and there is also a trend in 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.410
 What is prescribed is an announcement 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.680
 because if 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.580
 homepage or delta want to write there 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.200
 you look in his 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.290
 project description is too humid for me 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.960
 have and what will be and most of all 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.400
 do not wait is we see each other in 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.720
 the incredibly cool forum where you 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.130
 Everything can be learned because you all are 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:19.090
 teaching each other and that 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:20.440
 totally cool is for even more detailed 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.410
 and more and nonsense and so I had 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.360
 Unfortunately no time 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:29.310
 in this sense, wish you much fun in 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.310
 forum and see you next time
