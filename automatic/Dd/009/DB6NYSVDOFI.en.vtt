00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.439
 from the first of april 2008 comes in german version 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.039
 for the first one is way we switch to the settings and there in the 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.480
 Platinum more precisely in the entrance Platins we select the 11 Neuss on the races 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.060
 SV 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:34.580
 Place out 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.170
 There she now caught empty space and when she double-clicked her mouse 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.620

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.460
 is a nice animation appears when now with the 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.130
 Mouse click on it changes the animations 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.190
 and again 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.870
 and again there are some nice animations 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:59.030
 hiding in the bieber dialogue this plagues the 1 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.370
 in another Plattling the Forbes decoder boards also an entrance 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.890
 Pleitgen for Winamp it also hides Niester Heck 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.390
 see this fish 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.710
 When he double-clicks with the mouse, he starts to turn 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.430
 if you double-click faster with the mouse that always sounds 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.680
 to turn faster 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.300
 that is so cool is called and faded 550 rpm is mine 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.120
 current record 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.880
 I'll show them another game that's even hidden in Winamp 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.000
 Here, first of all, the skins Bento must be set 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.860
 then change who modern skins and then double click with the mouse 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.880
 on the over dialogue 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.880
 Now a snack starts old games 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.020
 Ben is controlled by the house Dahl with the arrow keys they control 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.950
 the snake the virtual and it applies to these llamas a symbol for Winamp 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.680
 to capture and to eat 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.810
 Zeus I just died but we start a new round 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.720
 The goal of a level is to eat the given number of lammers in the first one 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.720
 Levels into the ninth overall, they have four lives 

00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:14.339
 all five lives 

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:17.339
 to push up the high score 

00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:22.939
 we are coming to another easter egg in Neuss hoping Winamp about dialogue 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.959
 Heermann he once the usual animation if you now with the font 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.709
