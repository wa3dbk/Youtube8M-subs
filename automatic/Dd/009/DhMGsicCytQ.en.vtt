hello I spent the last two days working
on<00:00:05.339> a<00:00:05.370> bigger<00:00:05.850> version<00:00:06.120> of<00:00:06.390> the<00:00:06.569> door<00:00:06.990> I<00:00:07.200> showed

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
on a bigger version of the door I showed

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.499 
on a bigger version of the door I showed
in<00:00:07.830> the<00:00:07.979> last<00:00:08.010> video<00:00:08.370> I<00:00:08.790> added<00:00:09.240> some<00:00:09.269> new

00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:09.509 
in the last video I added some new

00:00:09.509 --> 00:00:12.709 
in the last video I added some new
features<00:00:09.990> to<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.980> idea<00:00:11.340> and<00:00:11.580> here<00:00:12.210> it<00:00:12.330> is<00:00:12.360> it's

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
features to the idea and here it is it's

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.500 
features to the idea and here it is it's
a<00:00:13.190> 10<00:00:14.190> x<00:00:14.580> 5<00:00:14.940> gate<00:00:15.470> at<00:00:16.550> first<00:00:17.550> I<00:00:17.760> have<00:00:17.970> to<00:00:18.000> start<00:00:18.390> a

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
a 10 x 5 gate at first I have to start a

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.470 
a 10 x 5 gate at first I have to start a
piston<00:00:18.960> system<00:00:19.279> later<00:00:20.279> I<00:00:20.400> will<00:00:20.550> add<00:00:20.970> a<00:00:21.000> circuit

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
piston system later I will add a circuit

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.630 
piston system later I will add a circuit
that<00:00:21.510> starts<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:22.410> stops<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:23.039> automatically

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
that starts and stops and automatically

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.080 
that starts and stops and automatically
I<00:00:24.199> have<00:00:25.199> a<00:00:25.230> one<00:00:25.680> button<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:26.250> open<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:27.029> close

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090

I have a one button to open and close
the<00:00:27.480> door<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.439> advantage<00:00:28.980> of<00:00:29.160> this<00:00:29.279> new

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
the door and the advantage of this new

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.759 
the door and the advantage of this new
system<00:00:29.760> is<00:00:30.090> that<00:00:30.119> it's<00:00:30.390> incredibly<00:00:31.140> fast<00:00:31.470> and

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
system is that it's incredibly fast and

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.700 
system is that it's incredibly fast and
i<00:00:32.130> will<00:00:32.430> show<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:32.670> by<00:00:33.330> opening<00:00:33.750> closing<00:00:34.470> the

ops<00:01:04.890> the<00:01:05.700> only<00:01:06.060> new<00:01:06.300> feature<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:07.110> that<00:01:07.140> we<00:01:07.950> have

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
ops the only new feature is that we have

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:17.170 
ops the only new feature is that we have
two<00:01:08.340> pipelines<00:01:08.670> from<00:01:09.180> the<00:01:09.510> pit<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:10.050> top

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.520 

and<00:01:19.310> here's<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.520> power<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:21.210> makes<00:01:21.840> us<00:01:22.050> in<00:01:22.350> so

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
and here's the power that makes us in so

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.190 
and here's the power that makes us in so
fast<00:01:22.740> what<00:01:23.370> this<00:01:23.580> thing<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:23.880> is<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.300> double

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
fast what this thing is is a double

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.220 
fast what this thing is is a double
buffer<00:01:25.650> for<00:01:26.070> this<00:01:26.610> end<00:01:26.940> so<00:01:27.480> you<00:01:27.510> can<00:01:27.840> directly

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:28.230 
buffer for this end so you can directly

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.740 
buffer for this end so you can directly
open<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.770> door<00:01:29.010> two<00:01:29.400> times<00:01:29.640> right<00:01:30.150> now<00:01:30.330> both

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
off and this part right here will set up

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:54.840 
off and this part right here will set up
the<00:02:45.190> polls<00:02:45.700> when<00:02:46.000> you<00:02:46.120> turn<00:02:46.450> it<00:02:46.480> on<00:02:53.700> this<00:02:54.700> is

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
the polls when you turn it on this is

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.970 
the polls when you turn it on this is
now<00:02:55.000> one<00:02:55.270> of<00:02:55.300> the<00:02:55.510> biggest<00:02:55.720> problems<00:02:56.230> these

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
now one of the biggest problems these

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.840 
now one of the biggest problems these
huge<00:02:57.870> coulombs<00:02:58.870> of<00:02:59.050> sand<00:02:59.320> for<00:02:59.590> me<00:02:59.709> I<00:02:59.920> have<00:03:00.700> to

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
huge coulombs of sand for me I have to

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.580 
huge coulombs of sand for me I have to
think<00:03:01.060> about<00:03:01.239> solutions<00:03:01.660> how<00:03:02.080> to<00:03:02.110> fix<00:03:02.440> that

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
think about solutions how to fix that

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.530 
think about solutions how to fix that
when<00:03:03.010> they<00:03:03.160> stack<00:03:03.550> up<00:03:03.580> too<00:03:03.910> high<00:03:04.120> they<00:03:04.360> will

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
when they stack up too high they will

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
when they stack up too high they will
block<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:04.959> doors<00:03:05.200> up<00:03:05.620> there<00:03:07.019> here's<00:03:08.019> the<00:03:08.140> wire

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
block the doors up there here's the wire

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.290 
block the doors up there here's the wire
of<00:03:08.800> the<00:03:08.950> open<00:03:09.220> and<00:03:09.340> close<00:03:09.519> button<00:03:09.910> coming<00:03:10.209> in

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
of the open and close button coming in

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.259 
of the open and close button coming in
and<00:03:10.450> by<00:03:11.050> this<00:03:11.110> simple<00:03:12.010> circuit<00:03:12.519> here<00:03:12.790> it's

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
and by this simple circuit here it's

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.050 
and by this simple circuit here it's
possible<00:03:13.959> to<00:03:14.170> toggle<00:03:14.680> the<00:03:15.010> door<00:03:15.220> I<00:03:15.459> will

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
possible to toggle the door I will

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.000 
possible to toggle the door I will
demonstrate<00:03:16.209> real<00:03:16.780> quick<00:03:18.060> and<00:03:19.739> these<00:03:20.739> two

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
demonstrate real quick and these two

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.430 
demonstrate real quick and these two
little<00:03:21.220> circuits<00:03:21.730> add<00:03:22.000> a<00:03:22.060> bit<00:03:22.570> more<00:03:22.600> of<00:03:23.050> signal

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
little circuits add a bit more of signal

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.009 
little circuits add a bit more of signal
lengths<00:03:23.650> to<00:03:24.040> make<00:03:24.190> both<00:03:24.519> doors<00:03:25.030> stay<00:03:25.989> open

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
lengths to make both doors stay open

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:33.630 
lengths to make both doors stay open
long<00:03:26.530> enough

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.840 

so<00:03:34.640> that's<00:03:35.000> about<00:03:35.150> it<00:03:35.330> and<00:03:35.750> I<00:03:36.200> have<00:03:37.100> hidden

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
so that's about it and I have hidden

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.090 
so that's about it and I have hidden
some<00:03:38.390> of<00:03:38.540> the<00:03:38.660> wires<00:03:38.870> down<00:03:39.170> the<00:03:39.319> walls<00:03:39.530> to<00:03:39.950> make

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
some of the wires down the walls to make

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:41.830 
some of the wires down the walls to make
it<00:03:40.220> look<00:03:40.370> a<00:03:40.490> little<00:03:40.610> bit<00:03:40.819> cleaner<00:03:41.060> but<00:03:41.420> except

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
it look a little bit cleaner but except

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.020 
it look a little bit cleaner but except
for<00:03:41.870> that<00:03:42.140> you<00:03:42.470> have<00:03:42.680> seen<00:03:42.890> everything<00:03:43.520> about

it I think you can see that the whole
thing<00:04:06.050> is<00:04:06.440> working<00:04:07.100> really<00:04:07.760> well<00:04:07.940> and<00:04:08.420> yeah
