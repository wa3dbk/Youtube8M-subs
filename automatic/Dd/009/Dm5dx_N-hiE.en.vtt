master sword because the because that's

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.260

all it was the pre chorea blade and it
gets<00:01:57.540> turned<00:01:58.020> into<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.380> force<00:01:58.649> or<00:01:58.950> so

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
gets turned into the force or so

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.969 
gets turned into the force or so
for<00:02:00.840> sword<00:02:01.939> whatever<00:02:03.079> its<00:02:04.079> internal<00:02:04.679> so<00:02:04.920> you

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
for sword whatever its internal so you

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.449
