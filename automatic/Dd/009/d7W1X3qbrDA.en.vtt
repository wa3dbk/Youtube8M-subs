00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.349 
day and a single pack for night one of
the<00:00:16.680> reasons<00:00:16.980> we<00:00:17.100> created<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.699> onit<00:00:17.970> products

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
the reasons we created the onit products

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.240 
the reasons we created the onit products
to<00:00:18.420> begin<00:00:18.720> with<00:00:18.900> was<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.289> make<00:00:19.470> things<00:00:19.770> simple

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
to begin with was to make things simple

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.250 
to begin with was to make things simple
I<00:00:20.400> remember<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:21.150> used<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.449> have<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.660> vitamin

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
I remember I used to have a vitamin

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.230 
I remember I used to have a vitamin
cabinet<00:00:22.680> full<00:00:22.830> of<00:00:22.890> supplements<00:00:23.519> just<00:00:23.910> from<00:00:24.119> my

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
cabinet full of supplements just from my

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.849 
cabinet full of supplements just from my
brain<00:00:24.510> so<00:00:24.960> I<00:00:24.990> wanted<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.320> put<00:00:25.470> those<00:00:25.619> together

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
brain so I wanted to put those together

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.040 
brain so I wanted to put those together
and<00:00:26.189> create<00:00:26.430> alpha<00:00:26.670> brain<00:00:27.000> well<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.779> brain<00:00:28.019> is

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
and create alpha brain well the brain is

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.349 
and create alpha brain well the brain is
just<00:00:28.410> one<00:00:28.650> component<00:00:29.039> of<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.609> body<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.119> the

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
just one component of the body and the

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.659 
just one component of the body and the
human<00:00:30.480> mechanism<00:00:30.840> so<00:00:31.710> there's<00:00:32.460> other

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
human mechanism so there's other

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.100 
human mechanism so there's other
elements<00:00:32.880> that<00:00:33.210> we<00:00:33.300> needed<00:00:33.600> as<00:00:33.719> well<00:00:33.840> so<00:00:34.079> I

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
elements that we needed as well so I

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.110 
elements that we needed as well so I
created<00:00:34.559> other<00:00:34.739> formulas<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.309> combined<00:00:35.820> all

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
created other formulas that combined all

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.880 
created other formulas that combined all
the<00:00:36.329> best<00:00:36.540> herbs<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:37.170> nutrients<00:00:37.739> and

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
the best herbs and nutrients and

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.190 
the best herbs and nutrients and
supplements<00:00:38.040> together<00:00:38.610> in<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.300> single<00:00:39.510> formula

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
supplements together in a single formula

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.350 
supplements together in a single formula
formula<00:00:40.469> like<00:00:40.800> new<00:00:41.040> mood<00:00:41.309> or<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.790> formula<00:00:42.329> like

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
formula like new mood or a formula like

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.560 
formula like new mood or a formula like
shrimp<00:00:42.840> export<00:00:43.850> still<00:00:44.850> at<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.239> end<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.510> the

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
shrimp export still at the end of the
