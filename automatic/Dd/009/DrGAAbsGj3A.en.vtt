00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:56.700 
and the new 2010 Camaro as well so we do

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.370 
and the new 2010 Camaro as well so we do
that<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.090> also<00:00:57.300> now<00:00:57.660> because<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.320> the

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
supercharged industry and the fact that

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.760 
supercharged industry and the fact that
there's<00:01:00.720> a<00:01:00.780> lot<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:00.989> people<00:01:01.230> super<00:01:01.470> charging

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
there's a lot of people super charging

as<00:01:08.280> well<00:01:08.540> what<00:01:09.540> sets<00:01:09.810> your<00:01:09.960> products<00:01:10.380> apart

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
as well what sets your products apart

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.760 
as well what sets your products apart
from<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.950> other<00:01:11.090> well<00:01:12.090> we<00:01:12.719> use<00:01:12.899> an<00:01:13.109> assembly

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
from the other well we use an assembly

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.620 
from the other well we use an assembly
system<00:01:14.069> which<00:01:14.399> isn't<00:01:14.579> unique<00:01:14.969> it's<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.299> system

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
system which isn't unique it's a system

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.209 
system which isn't unique it's a system
used<00:01:15.840> by<00:01:16.020> companies<00:01:16.380> in<00:01:16.740> Germany<00:01:16.920> like

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:17.219 
used by companies in Germany like

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:20.330 
used by companies in Germany like
Mercedes<00:01:17.700> Benz<00:01:17.969> Porsche<00:01:18.810> BMW<00:01:19.710> but<00:01:20.100> it's<00:01:20.249> a

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
Mercedes Benz Porsche BMW but it's a

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.950 
Mercedes Benz Porsche BMW but it's a
bonding<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.939> balance<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:21.389> most<00:01:21.600> harmonic

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
bonding of the balance so most harmonic

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.510 
bonding of the balance so most harmonic
balancers<00:01:22.469> are<00:01:22.619> inserted<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.219> is<00:01:23.340> the

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
balancers are inserted that is the

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.399 
balancers are inserted that is the
rubber<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:23.850> just<00:01:24.090> pressed<00:01:24.630> into<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.990> assembly

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
rubber is just pressed into the assembly

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.959 
rubber is just pressed into the assembly
and<00:01:25.560> then<00:01:25.979> they're<00:01:26.130> prone<00:01:26.399> to<00:01:26.549> failure

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:26.969 
and then they're prone to failure

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:28.309 
and then they're prone to failure
they're<00:01:27.240> kind<00:01:27.450> of<00:01:27.539> spinning<00:01:27.959> and<00:01:28.049> coming

00:01:28.309 --> 00:01:28.319 
they're kind of spinning and coming

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:30.169 
they're kind of spinning and coming
apart<00:01:28.619> as<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:28.950> lot<00:01:29.189> of<00:01:29.280> your<00:01:29.429> viewers<00:01:29.939> are

00:01:30.169 --> 00:01:30.179 
apart as a lot of your viewers are

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:32.149 
apart as a lot of your viewers are
probably<00:01:30.270> know<00:01:30.689> but<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.259> bonded<00:01:31.619> balancer<00:01:32.039> is

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
probably know but a bonded balancer is

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.800 
probably know but a bonded balancer is
actually<00:01:32.520> assembled<00:01:32.999> under<00:01:33.240> pressure<00:01:33.479> and

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
actually assembled under pressure and

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.809 
actually assembled under pressure and
heat<00:01:34.109> and<00:01:34.679> it<00:01:34.799> actually<00:01:34.979> has<00:01:35.399> an<00:01:35.549> enormous

00:01:35.809 --> 00:01:35.819 
heat and it actually has an enormous

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:37.609 
heat and it actually has an enormous
strength<00:01:36.270> in<00:01:36.450> terms<00:01:36.600> of<00:01:36.779> torque<00:01:37.020> strength<00:01:37.319> and

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
strength in terms of torque strength and

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.539 
strength in terms of torque strength and
also<00:01:37.770> push<00:01:38.100> up<00:01:38.249> that<00:01:38.340> strength<00:01:40.219> we<00:01:41.219> use<00:01:41.369> for

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
also push up that strength we use for

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.699 
also push up that strength we use for
SFI<00:01:41.999> series<00:01:42.389> balances<00:01:42.840> we<00:01:42.959> use<00:01:43.109> forged<00:01:43.439> steel

00:01:43.699 --> 00:01:43.709 
SFI series balances we use forged steel

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:45.499 
SFI series balances we use forged steel
both<00:01:44.249> forged<00:01:44.579> steel<00:01:44.729> rings<00:01:44.999> and<00:01:45.149> hubs<00:01:45.359> which

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
both forged steel rings and hubs which

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.660 
both forged steel rings and hubs which
allows<00:01:45.749> us<00:01:45.959> to<00:01:46.079> keep<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.380> assembly<00:01:46.709> light<00:01:47.100> but

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
allows us to keep the assembly light but

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.800 
allows us to keep the assembly light but
also<00:01:47.819> give<00:01:48.149> it<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.299> national<00:01:48.420> cutting<00:01:48.749> off

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
also give it a national cutting off

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.359 
also give it a national cutting off
