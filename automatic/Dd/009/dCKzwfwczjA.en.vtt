00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:16.270 
so the dunks kind of came about in the

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.030 
so the dunks kind of came about in the
first<00:00:16.450> couple<00:00:16.720> weeks<00:00:17.020> by<00:00:17.260> accident<00:00:17.800> we<00:00:17.950> were

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:18.040 
first couple weeks by accident we were

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.710 
first couple weeks by accident we were
just<00:00:18.189> struggling<00:00:18.490> on<00:00:18.700> offense<00:00:19.180> and<00:00:19.300> deluca's

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:19.720 
just struggling on offense and deluca's

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.450 
just struggling on offense and deluca's
started<00:00:20.050> throwing<00:00:20.320> in<00:00:20.500> Dane<00:00:20.740> dorko<00:00:21.189> I<00:00:21.220> think

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:21.460 
started throwing in Dane dorko I think

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.390 
started throwing in Dane dorko I think
we<00:00:21.520> got<00:00:21.550> like<00:00:21.849> couple<00:00:22.270> dunks<00:00:22.630> I<00:00:23.220> was<00:00:24.220> five

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:24.400 
we got like couple dunks I was five

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.460 
we got like couple dunks I was five
about<00:00:24.610> last<00:00:24.849> year<00:00:25.270> me<00:00:25.660> buddy<00:00:25.990> greco<00:00:26.169> and<00:00:26.380> a

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.470 
about last year me buddy greco and a

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:27.900 
about last year me buddy greco and a
indoor<00:00:26.680> tell<00:00:26.890> you<00:00:27.009> know<00:00:27.099> kind<00:00:27.400> of<00:00:27.460> started<00:00:27.820> it

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:27.910 
indoor tell you know kind of started it

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.370 
indoor tell you know kind of started it
if<00:00:28.150> we<00:00:28.240> were<00:00:28.300> always<00:00:28.419> angled<00:00:28.810> off<00:00:28.989> each<00:00:29.169> other

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:29.380 
if we were always angled off each other

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.319 
if we were always angled off each other
playing<00:00:29.649> once<00:00:30.550> it<00:00:30.669> started<00:00:30.849> happening<00:00:30.970> it<00:00:31.210> got

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:31.329 
playing once it started happening it got

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:32.850 
playing once it started happening it got
a<00:00:31.360> lot<00:00:31.509> easier<00:00:31.540> for<00:00:31.869> everybody<00:00:32.140> to<00:00:32.349> score<00:00:32.590> so

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:32.860 
a lot easier for everybody to score so

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:38.180 
a lot easier for everybody to score so
just<00:00:33.370> added<00:00:33.579> another<00:00:33.640> dimension<00:00:33.880> to<00:00:34.420> our<00:00:34.480> team

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.729 

I<00:00:39.109> think<00:00:40.109> it<00:00:40.199> was<00:00:40.260> just<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.500> natural

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
I think it was just a natural

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.549 
I think it was just a natural
progression<00:00:41.609> of<00:00:42.210> how<00:00:42.390> firm<00:00:42.719> evolved<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.469> the

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
progression of how firm evolved and the

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.350 
progression of how firm evolved and the
rule<00:00:43.769> changes<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:44.309> went<00:00:44.489> on<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.879> couple

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
rule changes that went on a couple

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.200 
rule changes that went on a couple
seasons<00:00:45.570> ago<00:00:45.809> flex<00:00:46.379> shots<00:00:46.649> for<00:00:47.010> three<00:00:47.460> so<00:00:47.730> it

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
seasons ago flex shots for three so it

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.990 
seasons ago flex shots for three so it
made<00:00:48.480> more<00:00:48.690> sense<00:00:48.750> both<00:00:49.640> statistically<00:00:50.640> and

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
made more sense both statistically and

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.029 
made more sense both statistically and
percentage<00:00:51.480> wise<00:00:51.659> to<00:00:52.199> be<00:00:52.530> shooting<00:00:52.890> those

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
percentage wise to be shooting those

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.430 
percentage wise to be shooting those
three<00:00:53.280> point<00:00:53.489> shots<00:00:53.760> because<00:00:54.210> not<00:00:54.570> only<00:00:54.600> do<00:00:55.320> we

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
three point shots because not only do we

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.990 
three point shots because not only do we
consider<00:00:55.799> them<00:00:55.979> the<00:00:56.100> easiest<00:00:56.549> shots<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.969> make

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
consider them the easiest shots to make

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.719 
consider them the easiest shots to make
and<00:00:57.360> Crone<00:00:57.600> them<00:00:57.780> because<00:00:58.769> of<00:00:58.799> your<00:00:59.010> angle<00:00:59.430> and

00:00:59.719 --> 00:00:59.729 
and Crone them because of your angle and

00:00:59.729 --> 00:01:01.369 
and Crone them because of your angle and
the<00:00:59.879> way<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.120> defenses<00:01:00.600> are<00:01:00.719> aligned<00:01:01.019> but

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
the way the defenses are aligned but

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.439 
the way the defenses are aligned but
back<00:01:01.739> then<00:01:01.769> it<00:01:01.949> was<00:01:02.129> three<00:01:02.370> points<00:01:02.699> but<00:01:03.269> then

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
back then it was three points but then

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.350 
back then it was three points but then
the<00:01:03.780> rule<00:01:04.199> changes<00:01:04.530> came<00:01:04.680> along<00:01:04.979> and<00:01:05.360> outside

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
the rule changes came along and outside

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.210 
the rule changes came along and outside
the<00:01:06.390> wedge<00:01:06.659> area<00:01:07.020> was<00:01:07.200> only<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.409> two<00:01:07.680> but<00:01:08.159> you

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
the wedge area was only a two but you

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.100 
the wedge area was only a two but you
can<00:01:08.310> also<00:01:08.460> go<00:01:08.729> in<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.060> goal<00:01:09.240> zone<00:01:09.509> and<00:01:09.780> that's

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
can also go in the goal zone and that's

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.740 
can also go in the goal zone and that's
two<00:01:10.619> as<00:01:10.800> well<00:01:10.979> we<00:01:11.520> realize<00:01:11.789> you<00:01:12.060> know<00:01:12.210> with<00:01:12.720> the

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
two as well we realize you know with the

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.230 
two as well we realize you know with the
change<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.289> the<00:01:13.409> flex<00:01:13.710> 22<00:01:14.039> points<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:15.060> was<00:01:15.179> the

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
change of the flex 22 points it was the

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.760 
change of the flex 22 points it was the
same<00:01:15.420> as<00:01:15.570> hitting<00:01:15.780> from<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.020> flex<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.590> it<00:01:16.679> was

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
same as hitting from the flex and it was

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.190 
same as hitting from the flex and it was
open<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.340> we<00:01:17.850> got<00:01:18.000> some<00:01:18.030> big<00:01:18.360> wedge<00:01:18.569> bacterial

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
open so we got some big wedge bacterial

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.630 
open so we got some big wedge bacterial
just<00:01:19.440> throw<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.740> in<00:01:19.830> there<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:19.979> start<00:01:20.250> dunking

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
just throw it in there and start dunking

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.160 
just throw it in there and start dunking
on

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.399 

I<00:01:25.150> just<00:01:26.150> think<00:01:26.330> it's<00:01:26.450> one<00:01:26.600> of<00:01:26.630> the<00:01:26.750> simplest

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
I just think it's one of the simplest

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:29.649 
I just think it's one of the simplest
players<00:01:27.650> you<00:01:27.710> can<00:01:27.770> run<00:01:28.009> in<00:01:28.280> croton<00:01:28.670> you<00:01:29.479> can

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
players you can run in croton you can

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:31.120 
players you can run in croton you can
really<00:01:29.930> hold<00:01:30.140> the<00:01:30.259> defense<00:01:30.590> out<00:01:30.890> of<00:01:31.040> their

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
really hold the defense out of their

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.700 
really hold the defense out of their
zone<00:01:31.310> and<00:01:31.580> make<00:01:31.850> them<00:01:31.939> feel<00:01:32.090> uncomfortable

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
zone and make them feel uncomfortable

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:34.630 
zone and make them feel uncomfortable
it's<00:01:33.710> multiple<00:01:34.040> ways<00:01:34.159> of<00:01:34.280> scoring<00:01:34.430> you<00:01:34.580> know

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
it's multiple ways of scoring you know

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.620 
it's multiple ways of scoring you know
you<00:01:34.700> go<00:01:34.850> up<00:01:34.970> there<00:01:35.060> you<00:01:35.180> hang<00:01:35.330> in<00:01:35.450> the<00:01:35.509> air<00:01:35.540> a

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
you go up there you hang in the air a

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:36.730 
you go up there you hang in the air a
little<00:01:35.720> bit<00:01:35.990> you<00:01:36.140> can<00:01:36.229> hang<00:01:36.380> it<00:01:36.439> in<00:01:36.500> the<00:01:36.560> back

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
little bit you can hang it in the back

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.260 
little bit you can hang it in the back
door<00:01:36.920> or<00:01:37.189> the<00:01:37.460> white<00:01:37.640> backslides<00:01:38.030> that<00:01:38.180> way

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
door or the white backslides that way

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.789 
door or the white backslides that way
you<00:01:38.330> can<00:01:38.479> take<00:01:38.600> a<00:01:38.630> shot<00:01:38.840> and<00:01:39.020> just<00:01:39.200> a<00:01:39.380> good<00:01:39.710> way

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
you can take a shot and just a good way

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:41.529 
you can take a shot and just a good way
to<00:01:39.860> get<00:01:39.950> richer<00:01:40.250> points<00:01:40.520> it<00:01:40.909> goes<00:01:41.090> on<00:01:41.240> for<00:01:41.450> me

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:41.539 
to get richer points it goes on for me

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:43.389 
to get richer points it goes on for me
on<00:01:41.659> offense<00:01:42.049> it's<00:01:42.259> huge<00:01:42.500> because<00:01:42.649> I'm<00:01:43.250> an

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:43.399 
on offense it's huge because I'm an

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:44.889 
on offense it's huge because I'm an
option<00:01:43.789> they<00:01:44.119> could<00:01:44.270> hit<00:01:44.390> me<00:01:44.420> with<00:01:44.600> the<00:01:44.630> past

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
option they could hit me with the past

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:46.480 
option they could hit me with the past
and<00:01:45.080> I<00:01:45.110> could<00:01:45.259> try<00:01:45.380> to<00:01:45.440> get<00:01:45.560> the<00:01:45.680> dump<00:01:45.890> or<00:01:46.280> even

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
and I could try to get the dump or even

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:47.800 
and I could try to get the dump or even
if<00:01:46.610> it's<00:01:46.759> just<00:01:46.820> making<00:01:47.149> the<00:01:47.240> goalie<00:01:47.450> kind<00:01:47.720> of

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
if it's just making the goalie kind of

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.090 
if it's just making the goalie kind of
check<00:01:47.990> his<00:01:48.140> shoulder<00:01:48.500> it's<00:01:48.649> gonna<00:01:48.740> make<00:01:48.950> him

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
check his shoulder it's gonna make him

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.010 
check his shoulder it's gonna make him
that<00:01:49.250> much<00:01:49.430> slower<00:01:49.700> when<00:01:50.240> the<00:01:50.360> shot<00:01:50.600> comes<00:01:50.869> he

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
that much slower when the shot comes he

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.200 
that much slower when the shot comes he
gets<00:01:51.049> in<00:01:51.350> the<00:01:51.409> goalies<00:01:51.740> head<00:01:51.950> it<00:01:52.670> really<00:01:52.909> kept

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
gets in the goalies head it really kept

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.270 
gets in the goalies head it really kept
better<00:01:53.899> wedge<00:01:54.200> backs<00:01:54.500> off<00:01:54.740> balance

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
better wedge backs off balance

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.830 
better wedge backs off balance
definitely<00:01:55.850> gets<00:01:55.970> in<00:01:56.060> their<00:01:56.149> head<00:01:56.300> and<00:01:56.330> no<00:01:56.750> one

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
definitely gets in their head and no one

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.149 
definitely gets in their head and no one
really<00:01:57.020> likes<00:01:57.050> get<00:01:57.380> enough<00:01:57.590> getting<00:01:57.920> dunked

especially<00:02:13.650> on<00:02:14.069> the<00:02:14.160> inbounds<00:02:14.640> plays<00:02:14.849> if<00:02:15.390> you

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
especially on the inbounds plays if you

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.120 
especially on the inbounds plays if you
get<00:02:15.630> that<00:02:15.750> quick<00:02:15.959> pass<00:02:16.200> in<00:02:16.500> they<00:02:16.920> might<00:02:17.099> not

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
get that quick pass in they might not

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.250 
get that quick pass in they might not
see<00:02:17.459> you<00:02:17.489> crashing<00:02:18.120> back<00:02:18.300> door<00:02:18.540> so<00:02:18.780> that<00:02:19.020> could

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
see you crashing back door so that could

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.750 
see you crashing back door so that could
be<00:02:19.290> a<00:02:19.380> huge<00:02:19.680> advantage<00:02:19.830> right<00:02:20.250> off<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:20.550> out<00:02:20.640> of

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
be a huge advantage right off and out of

be a huge advantage right off and out of
bounds<00:02:20.880> you<00:02:21.510> got<00:02:21.660> two<00:02:21.810> points<00:02:22.140> real<00:02:22.290> quick<00:02:22.560> I

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
bounds you got two points real quick I

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.380 
bounds you got two points real quick I
feel<00:02:23.280> like<00:02:23.340> it's<00:02:23.520> almost<00:02:23.670> a<00:02:23.940> timing<00:02:24.360> thing

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390

a chest pass he's just opening up and

a chest pass he's just opening up and
coming<00:03:06.690> across<00:03:06.870> looking<00:03:07.380> to<00:03:07.500> get<00:03:07.650> a<00:03:07.709> hard<00:03:07.950> foul

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
coming across looking to get a hard foul

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.890

or<00:03:08.430> a<00:03:08.459> block<00:03:08.700> on<00:03:08.730> your<00:03:09.000> guy<00:03:09.090> so<00:03:09.330> I<00:03:09.360> think<00:03:09.450> a<00:03:09.660> wide

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
or a block on your guy so I think a wide

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.750 
or a block on your guy so I think a wide
bounce<00:03:10.230> pass<00:03:10.530> is<00:03:10.739> probably<00:03:10.860> the<00:03:11.100> best<00:03:11.310> entry

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.400 

and<00:03:14.760> I<00:03:14.910> think<00:03:15.150> Kyle<00:03:15.329> was<00:03:15.570> wondering<00:03:15.930> is<00:03:16.260> there

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410
