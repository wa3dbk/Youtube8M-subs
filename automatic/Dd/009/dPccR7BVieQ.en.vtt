a<00:00:48.180> couple<00:00:48.450> of<00:00:48.510> videos<00:00:48.719> ago<00:00:48.840> as<00:00:49.620> well<00:00:49.710> go<00:00:49.829> out

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
a couple of videos ago as well go out

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.670 
a couple of videos ago as well go out
again<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.309> give<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.579> another<00:00:50.730> crack<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.680> I

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
again and give it another crack and I

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.350 
again and give it another crack and I
already<00:00:53.010> p1<00:00:53.309> but<00:00:53.550> my<00:00:53.670> teammate<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.059> pushing<00:00:54.300> me

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
already p1 but my teammate is pushing me

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.360 
already p1 but my teammate is pushing me
quite<00:00:54.510> hard<00:00:54.690> up<00:00:54.780> he's<00:00:55.020> got<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.140> very<00:00:55.320> low<00:00:55.530> 10.0

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
quite hard up he's got a very low 10.0

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.119 
quite hard up he's got a very low 10.0
point<00:00:56.640> one<00:00:56.760> perhaps<00:00:57.170> I<00:00:58.170> think<00:00:58.770> if<00:00:58.829> I'm<00:00:58.920> point

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
point one perhaps I think if I'm point

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.240 
point one perhaps I think if I'm point
one<00:00:59.280> so<00:00:59.520> it's<00:01:00.390> it's<00:01:01.199> close<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.739> he<00:01:02.100> could

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
one so it's it's close and he could

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.500 
one so it's it's close and he could
certainly<00:01:02.430> improve<00:01:02.789> because<00:01:03.090> he's<00:01:03.270> been

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
certainly improve because he's been

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.759 
certainly improve because he's been
within<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:03.960> couple<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.199> ten<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.409> meet<00:01:04.530> me<00:01:04.650> but

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
within a couple of ten to meet me but

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.969 
within a couple of ten to meet me but
then<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:05.549> my<00:01:05.729> third<00:01:06.030> or<00:01:06.150> fourth<00:01:06.360> lap<00:01:06.830> and<00:01:07.830> he's

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
then is my third or fourth lap and he's

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.770 
then is my third or fourth lap and he's
been<00:01:08.159> very<00:01:08.280> close<00:01:08.580> every<00:01:08.880> single<00:01:09.150> time<00:01:09.330> so<00:01:09.600> I

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
been very close every single time so I

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.120 
been very close every single time so I
need<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.110> improve<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.530> can<00:01:10.740> just<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:10.979> make<00:01:11.100> sure

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
need to improve I can just to make sure

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.580 
need to improve I can just to make sure
a<00:01:11.250> pulp<00:01:11.630> obviously<00:01:12.630> poll<00:01:12.840> is<00:01:13.110> absolutely

come<00:01:32.400> incredibly<00:01:33.030> close<00:01:33.240> on<00:01:33.570> one<00:01:33.900> one<00:01:34.110> so<00:01:34.350> just

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
come incredibly close on one one so just

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.410 
come incredibly close on one one so just
take<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.799> nice<00:01:34.979> these<00:01:35.130> now<00:01:35.340> they're<00:01:36.210> on<00:01:36.270> ice

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
take a nice these now they're on ice

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.520 
take a nice these now they're on ice
caps<00:01:36.659> attic<00:01:36.840> area<00:01:36.930> but<00:01:37.170> actually<00:01:37.380> pace

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
caps attic area but actually pace

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.440 
caps attic area but actually pace
anyways<00:01:37.860> so<00:01:38.009> now<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.250> ran<00:01:38.520> Kerry<00:01:38.700> not<00:01:38.820> slice

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
anyways so now that ran Kerry not slice

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.789 
anyways so now that ran Kerry not slice

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
all my cards as well for the gears we

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:44.960 
all my cards as well for the gears we
should<00:01:44.159> be<00:01:44.250> in<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.369> river<00:01:44.460> two<00:01:44.670> more<00:01:44.850> less

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
should be in the river two more less

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.130 
should be in the river two more less
than<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.149> first<00:01:45.240> one<00:01:45.450> yet<00:01:45.600> breaking<00:01:45.990> quite

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
than the first one yet breaking quite

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.660 
than the first one yet breaking quite
late<00:01:46.290> down<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.979> second<00:01:47.250> gate<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:47.460> would<00:01:47.549> turn

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
late down to second gate it would turn

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.920 
late down to second gate it would turn
into<00:01:47.700> short<00:01:48.090> ship<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.360> third<00:01:48.540> and<00:01:48.720> very

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
into short ship of the third and very

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.899 
into short ship of the third and very
very<00:01:49.290> close<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.770> warm<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.040> Exeter<00:01:50.369> and

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
very close to the warm the Exeter and

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:51.859 
very close to the warm the Exeter and
actually<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.299> wasn't<00:01:51.570> quite<00:01:51.659> perfect

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
actually that wasn't quite perfect

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.179 
actually that wasn't quite perfect
because<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.350> had<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.590> steer<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.920> little<00:01:52.950> bit

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
because I had to steer a little bit

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.080 
because I had to steer a little bit
longer<00:01:53.340> than<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:53.490> should<00:01:53.670> ever<00:01:53.759> wanted<00:01:54.030> to

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
longer than I should ever wanted to

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.490 
longer than I should ever wanted to
straighten<00:01:54.329> up<00:01:54.420> earlier<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:54.869> get<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.350> power

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
straighten up earlier and get the power

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.109 
straighten up earlier and get the power
bit<00:01:55.649> earlier<00:01:55.860> so<00:01:56.040> you<00:01:56.430> all<00:01:56.520> in<00:01:56.610> just<00:01:56.790> skim<00:01:57.030> the

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
bit earlier so you all in just skim the

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.340 
bit earlier so you all in just skim the
comments<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.540> once<00:01:57.719> again<00:01:57.810> skin<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.140> bearing

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
comments I once again skin the bearing

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.660 
comments I once again skin the bearing
and<00:01:58.409> all<00:01:58.530> swinged<00:01:58.829> in<00:01:58.920> just<00:01:59.219> try<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.549> see<00:01:59.640> the

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
and all swinged in just try and see the

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.010 
and all swinged in just try and see the
brown<00:01:59.880> the<00:01:59.939> right<00:02:00.060> side<00:02:00.240> but<00:02:00.390> doing<00:02:00.630> when<00:02:00.750> ever

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
brown the right side but doing when ever

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.200 
brown the right side but doing when ever
so<00:02:01.229> slightly<00:02:01.500> wide<00:02:01.710> bet<00:02:01.920> so<00:02:02.700> well<00:02:02.850> that's<00:02:03.000> why

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
so slightly wide bet so well that's why

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.020 
so slightly wide bet so well that's why
I'm<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.479> tenth<00:02:03.719> down<00:02:03.930> there<00:02:04.219> so<00:02:05.219> not<00:02:05.610> an<00:02:05.759> ideal

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
I'm a tenth down there so not an ideal

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.280 
I'm a tenth down there so not an ideal
start<00:02:06.329> but<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.540> first<00:02:06.719> set<00:02:06.840> but<00:02:06.869> my<00:02:07.020> previous

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
start but the first set but my previous

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.479 
start but the first set but my previous
that<00:02:07.380> was<00:02:07.500> very<00:02:07.680> very<00:02:07.979> good<00:02:08.190> anyway

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
that was very very good anyway

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.249 
that was very very good anyway
carrying<00:02:09.239> awesome<00:02:09.810> speed<00:02:10.050> through<00:02:10.170> the

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
carrying awesome speed through the

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.750 
carrying awesome speed through the
hairpin<00:02:10.590> really<00:02:11.039> really<00:02:11.370> good<00:02:11.520> speed<00:02:11.730> for

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
hairpin really really good speed for

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.020 
hairpin really really good speed for
there<00:02:12.000> actually

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
there actually

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.910 
there actually
once<00:02:13.420> again<00:02:13.630> good<00:02:13.750> speed<00:02:14.050> and<00:02:14.620> this<00:02:14.770> is

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
once again good speed and this is

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:15.990 
once again good speed and this is
important<00:02:15.190> to<00:02:15.250> Kyrgyz<00:02:15.490> people<00:02:15.520> here<00:02:15.819> as<00:02:15.880> well

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
not believe it when I crossed the line I

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.690 
not believe it when I crossed the line I
had<00:03:02.140> a<00:03:02.170> point<00:03:02.380> five<00:03:02.620> and<00:03:03.310> that's<00:03:03.489> that's

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
had a point five and that's that's

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.820 
had a point five and that's that's
definitely<00:03:03.970> my<00:03:04.269> PB<00:03:04.540> ever<00:03:04.720> at<00:03:04.870> Monaco<00:03:05.170> no<00:03:05.530> doubt

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
definitely my PB ever at Monaco no doubt

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:06.330 
definitely my PB ever at Monaco no doubt
about<00:03:06.010> it

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
about it

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.860 
about it
theoretically<00:03:07.120> while<00:03:07.390> you<00:03:07.480> still<00:03:07.600> lost<00:03:07.750> a

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
theoretically while you still lost a

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.030 
theoretically while you still lost a
tenth<00:03:08.080> theoretically<00:03:08.530> I<00:03:08.590> could<00:03:08.739> get<00:03:08.830> point

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
tenth theoretically I could get point

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.090 
tenth theoretically I could get point
four<00:03:09.220> but<00:03:10.000> uh<00:03:10.030> you<00:03:10.630> know<00:03:10.780> you<00:03:11.500> could<00:03:11.860> barely

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
four but uh you know you could barely

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.350 
four but uh you know you could barely
see<00:03:12.220> the<00:03:12.430> mistakes<00:03:12.760> in<00:03:12.880> the<00:03:12.970> first<00:03:13.150> sector

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
see the mistakes in the first sector

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.059 
see the mistakes in the first sector
like<00:03:13.840> so<00:03:13.989> the<00:03:14.080> first<00:03:14.260> corner<00:03:14.500> wasn't<00:03:14.739> perfect

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
like so the first corner wasn't perfect

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:16.350 
like so the first corner wasn't perfect
and<00:03:15.160> and<00:03:15.370> a<00:03:15.430> slightly<00:03:15.760> miss<00:03:15.910> may<00:03:16.030> depict<00:03:16.180> on

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
and and a slightly miss may depict on

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.600 
and and a slightly miss may depict on
top<00:03:16.480> of<00:03:16.600> hill<00:03:16.720> but<00:03:16.959> they<00:03:17.680> were<00:03:17.739> so<00:03:18.100> so<00:03:18.370> minor

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
top of hill but they were so so minor

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.190 
top of hill but they were so so minor
did<00:03:18.880> cost<00:03:19.060> me<00:03:19.180> a<00:03:19.209> tenth<00:03:19.420> but<00:03:19.600> there<00:03:19.690> was<00:03:19.780> so<00:03:19.959> -

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
did cost me a tenth but there was so -

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.890 
did cost me a tenth but there was so -
so<00:03:20.530> that<00:03:20.739> lap<00:03:21.400> I<00:03:21.610> tell<00:03:21.850> you<00:03:21.910> what<00:03:22.090> and<00:03:22.360> I<00:03:22.690> have

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
so that lap I tell you what and I have

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.120 
so that lap I tell you what and I have
barely<00:03:23.079> don't<00:03:23.350> adjust<00:03:23.530> in<00:03:23.709> the<00:03:23.799> commentary

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
barely don't adjust in the commentary

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.220 
barely don't adjust in the commentary
because<00:03:24.190> it<00:03:24.370> goes<00:03:24.489> by<00:03:24.730> so<00:03:24.760> fast<00:03:25.030> but<00:03:25.570> go<00:03:26.079> and

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
because it goes by so fast but go and

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.660 
because it goes by so fast but go and
watch<00:03:26.350> it<00:03:26.380> again<00:03:26.590> I've<00:03:26.950> actually<00:03:27.190> probably

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
watch it again I've actually probably

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.069 
watch it again I've actually probably
watched<00:03:27.850> that<00:03:27.970> lapse<00:03:28.150> oddly<00:03:28.540> enough<00:03:28.600> about

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
watched that lapse oddly enough about

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.080 
watched that lapse oddly enough about
ten<00:03:30.010> or<00:03:30.130> fifteen<00:03:30.280> times

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
ten or fifteen times
