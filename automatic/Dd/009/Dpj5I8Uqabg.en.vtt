00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.210
 so hello everyone i want to tell 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.790
 moment look in samp-rp that is how 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.280
 successful music to begin with you must 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.240
 find this place then there is a square 2 and 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.260
 9 interfere with as many cards as always 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.150
 to 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.090
 otherwise 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.240
 it not only square friends and 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:29.039
 i almost empty start it after 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.060
 expected left end so what will 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:36.890
 with yacht 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.890
 and and the aircraft plant began with 13 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.980
 if on the radio 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.390
 if i turn on now 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.610
 fps limit 90 put to give 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:01.820
 that is, I stupidly did not fly, I can in any way 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.630
 try not be able to fly 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:08.200
 now let's turn on the fps limit 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.200
 20 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:19.150
 and what is suddenly bad for once 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.240
 I found people see the fact is that 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.780
 as soon as you take off 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.479
 same with after mid 20 you are not there until you 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.820
 Turn on the engine, that is, either by command 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.290
 m or key 2 that is, it does not matter and 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.290
 let's ask 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:41.390
 hallelujah we took off and can fly and 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:43.460
 so on now about landing like on 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.899
 sit on it so forth honestly sits 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.909
 you can even land 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:50.360
 but only then he will be quickly 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:53.330
 take away hp airplane which 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.960
 check the command and preferably as 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:59.920
 only you took off to register the command fps 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.920
 limit 90 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.119
 and here is the horror of horror on landing 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.790
 Here I am successfully a whole garden 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.940
 again 20 please and also i want you 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:21.020
 tell how in it 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:23.390
 on this plane ride with a friend then 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.150
 There is such and many argue that 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.400
 then they say such a bug can not go with 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.519
 friend is all 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.240
 you just say so wrong doing 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:38.100
 case of aircraft 3 login 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.100
 matter how I had to give to 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.280
 we wait 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.980
 close 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.980
 he slept 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.930
 so glad myself 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.930
 the point is that it came as if 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.610
 moor 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.069
 so here is the pier and then a friend can 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.750
 to get on this plane in another way 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.000
 fail if you want to extract 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.660
 then the plane out of the water so let's 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.099
 I'll show you the simple gameplay now. 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.160
 fly this plane 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:25.400
 everybody knows this now we are writing a command 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:29.760
 fps limit 90 remember this command I her 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:33.860
 still writing the moon once in the description will leave 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.860
 Do not forget the sector to turn on the engine 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.980
 flew 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.870
 I think it will be all accelerated fudge 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.110
 so you just see who 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.950
 interesting 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.950
 I flew what 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:00.270
