useful<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.840> practicing<00:00:22.439> chemists<00:00:22.830> but

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
useful to the practicing chemists but

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.220 
useful to the practicing chemists but
the<00:00:23.699> daily<00:00:23.820> learner<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.420> introduce<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:25.109> new

the daily learner you introduce a new
product<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:26.130> that<00:00:26.279> is<00:00:26.550> there<00:00:26.730> are<00:00:26.820> all

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
product and that is there are all

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.810 
product and that is there are all
ceramic<00:00:27.510> powders<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.650> what<00:00:29.130> I<00:00:29.160> mean<00:00:29.460> by<00:00:29.519> all

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
ceramic powders and what I mean by all

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.880 
ceramic powders and what I mean by all
surrounding<00:00:30.269> polishes<00:00:30.720> are<00:00:30.900> higher<00:00:31.080> powers

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
surrounding polishes are higher powers

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.069 
surrounding polishes are higher powers
that<00:00:32.340> will<00:00:32.520> polish<00:00:32.940> any<00:00:33.210> ceramic<00:00:33.600> that<00:00:33.930> you

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
that will polish any ceramic that you

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.119 
that will polish any ceramic that you
have<00:00:34.320> beads<00:00:35.010> or<00:00:35.160> Konya<00:00:35.550> lithium<00:00:36.390> dye<00:00:36.510> silicon

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129 
have beads or Konya lithium dye silicon

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:40.819 
have beads or Konya lithium dye silicon
cells<00:00:38.129> Pathak<00:00:38.700> or<00:00:39.120> CAD<00:00:39.629> cam<00:00:39.930> ceramics<00:00:40.500> it'll

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
cells Pathak or CAD cam ceramics it'll

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.170 
cells Pathak or CAD cam ceramics it'll
bring<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.250> luster<00:00:41.670> that<00:00:41.700> you<00:00:41.969> won't

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
bring it to a luster that you won't

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.279 
bring it to a luster that you won't
believe<00:00:42.510> making<00:00:43.290> glazing<00:00:44.149> not<00:00:45.149> essential<00:00:45.840> and

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
believe making glazing not essential and

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.740 
believe making glazing not essential and
it<00:00:46.469> really<00:00:46.680> is<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:47.010> system<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.789> is<00:00:48.090> meant<00:00:48.660> to

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
it really is a system that is meant to

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.900 
it really is a system that is meant to
be<00:00:48.840> used<00:00:49.110> with<00:00:49.289> light<00:00:49.590> touch<00:00:49.920> under<00:00:50.640> most

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
be used with light touch under most

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.580 
be used with light touch under most
speeds<00:00:51.270> so<00:00:51.629> we're<00:00:52.140> going<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.320> give<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.500> a

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
speeds so we're going to give you a

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.279 
speeds so we're going to give you a
demonstration<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.640> this<00:00:53.969> demonstration<00:00:54.570> is

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
demonstration and this demonstration is

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.279 
demonstration and this demonstration is
going<00:00:55.680> to<00:00:55.800> represent<00:00:56.300> just<00:00:57.300> how<00:00:57.480> easy<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:58.170> is

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
going to represent just how easy it is

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.710 
going to represent just how easy it is
to<00:00:58.500> use
