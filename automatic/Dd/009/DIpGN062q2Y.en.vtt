00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
one LED panels in a softbox I mentioned

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.709 
one LED panels in a softbox I mentioned
before<00:01:02.190> that<00:01:02.430> i<00:01:02.550> was<00:01:02.609> using<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:03.030> softbox<00:01:03.449> with

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
before that i was using the softbox with

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.119 
before that i was using the softbox with
these<00:01:03.840> but<00:01:03.960> i've<00:01:04.080> never<00:01:04.290> really<00:01:04.559> discussed

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
these but i've never really discussed

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.730 
these but i've never really discussed
how<00:01:05.369> we<00:01:05.400> mounted<00:01:06.000> them<00:01:06.150> so<00:01:06.780> let's<00:01:06.990> take<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.200> look

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.200 

so<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.830> main<00:01:10.979> light<00:01:11.159> we<00:01:11.280> used<00:01:11.490> in<00:01:11.670> tim<00:01:11.850> crafts

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
so the main light we used in tim crafts

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.750 
so the main light we used in tim crafts
video<00:01:12.450> was<00:01:13.350> a<00:01:13.380> soft<00:01:13.710> box<00:01:13.979> just<00:01:14.189> like<00:01:14.280> this<00:01:14.400> one

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
video was a soft box just like this one

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.690 
video was a soft box just like this one
this<00:01:15.570> is<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.780> small<00:01:16.140> shamira<00:01:16.740> softbox<00:01:17.430> these

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
this is a small shamira softbox these

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.490 
this is a small shamira softbox these
that<00:01:17.909> are<00:01:18.090> actually<00:01:18.390> set<00:01:18.780> up<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:19.049> use<00:01:19.229> both

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
that are actually set up to use both

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.950 
that are actually set up to use both
video<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.330> strobe<00:01:21.330> lights<00:01:21.600> so<00:01:21.720> there's<00:01:21.900> a

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
video and strobe lights so there's a

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.590 
video and strobe lights so there's a
little<00:01:22.020> extra<00:01:22.470> room<00:01:22.650> here<00:01:23.210> obviously<00:01:24.210> this

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
little extra room here obviously this

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.390 
little extra room here obviously this
wasn't<00:01:24.869> originally<00:01:25.409> designed<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.950> use<00:01:26.159> with

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
wasn't originally designed to use with

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.880 
wasn't originally designed to use with
an<00:01:26.520> LED<00:01:26.759> panel<00:01:27.360> like<00:01:27.479> we're<00:01:27.689> using<00:01:27.840> here<00:01:28.320> so

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
an LED panel like we're using here so

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.590 
an LED panel like we're using here so
let<00:01:29.040> me<00:01:29.100> show<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.310> how<00:01:29.400> we<00:01:29.549> adapted<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.479> for

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
let me show you how we adapted it for

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.920 
let me show you how we adapted it for
our<00:01:30.720> use<00:01:31.759> when<00:01:32.759> we<00:01:32.880> remove<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.360> front<00:01:33.540> screen

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
our use when we remove the front screen

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.390 
our use when we remove the front screen
you<00:01:34.140> can<00:01:34.229> see<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:34.500> normally<00:01:35.040> there's<00:01:35.250> an

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
you can see that normally there's an

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.640 
you can see that normally there's an
internal<00:01:35.939> baffle<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.930> first<00:01:37.140> thing<00:01:37.320> we<00:01:37.439> did

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
internal baffle the first thing we did

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.160 
internal baffle the first thing we did
is<00:01:37.770> take<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:38.189> out<00:01:38.430> on<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:39.299> Shamir<00:01:39.659> box<00:01:39.930> is

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
is take that out on the Shamir box is

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.160 
is take that out on the Shamir box is
that<00:01:40.200> just<00:01:40.560> velcros<00:01:41.009> in<00:01:41.159> place<00:01:41.869> on<00:01:42.869> some<00:01:43.020> of

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
that just velcros in place on some of

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.539 
that just velcros in place on some of
the<00:01:43.229> photo<00:01:43.470> flex<00:01:43.799> ones<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.280> some<00:01:44.369> of<00:01:44.490> the

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
the photo flex ones and some of the

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.069 
the photo flex ones and some of the
other<00:01:44.670> brands<00:01:45.090> is<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.240> little<00:01:45.509> clip<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:45.930> can

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
other brands is a little clip you can

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.920 
other brands is a little clip you can
just<00:01:46.200> kick<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.409> right<00:01:46.530> out<00:01:47.570> so<00:01:48.570> once<00:01:48.750> we've

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
just kick it right out so once we've

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.990 
just kick it right out so once we've
removed<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.409> inner<00:01:49.680> baffle<00:01:50.159> we<00:01:50.759> have<00:01:50.880> to

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
removed the inner baffle we have to

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.929 
removed the inner baffle we have to
figure<00:01:51.180> out<00:01:51.299> some<00:01:51.750> way<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:51.990> mount<00:01:52.560> the<00:01:53.490> LED

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
figure out some way to mount the LED

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.420 
figure out some way to mount the LED
panel<00:01:54.390> into<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.320> box<00:01:55.560> since<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:55.979> won't<00:01:56.159> fit<00:01:56.369> on

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
panel into the box since it won't fit on

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.880 
panel into the box since it won't fit on
the<00:01:56.640> regular<00:01:57.060> speed<00:01:57.360> ring<00:01:57.600> so<00:01:58.320> how<00:01:58.469> we've<00:01:58.649> done

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
the regular speed ring so how we've done

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.940 
the regular speed ring so how we've done
that<00:01:59.070> here<00:01:59.520> as<00:01:59.850> i<00:02:00.750> went<00:02:00.960> ahead<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.229> mounted

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
that here as i went ahead and mounted

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.550 
that here as i went ahead and mounted
the<00:02:02.610> LED<00:02:03.000> panel<00:02:03.420> on<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:03.810> light<00:02:03.990> stand<00:02:04.229> this

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
the LED panel on the light stand this

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.010 
the LED panel on the light stand this
like<00:02:04.770> normal<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.460> we've<00:02:06.270> kind<00:02:06.450> of<00:02:06.509> floated

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
like normal and we've kind of floated

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.380 
like normal and we've kind of floated
the<00:02:07.140> box<00:02:07.380> on<00:02:07.590> top<00:02:07.649> with<00:02:08.129> this<00:02:08.250> magic<00:02:08.759> arm<00:02:08.970> so

if we take this off of here let me take

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.890 
if we take this off of here let me take
the<00:02:16.190> light<00:02:16.400> out<00:02:19.390> you<00:02:20.390> can<00:02:20.540> see<00:02:20.690> that<00:02:20.720> i<00:02:20.840> have

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
the light out you can see that i have

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.170 
the light out you can see that i have
this<00:02:21.170> attached<00:02:21.560> with<00:02:21.830> this<00:02:21.980> magic<00:02:22.400> arm<00:02:22.610> this

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
this attached with this magic arm this

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.280 
this attached with this magic arm this
is<00:02:23.360> made<00:02:23.510> by<00:02:23.690> manfrotto<00:02:25.870> this<00:02:26.870> is<00:02:27.019> just<00:02:27.170> a

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
is made by manfrotto this is just a

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.930 
is made by manfrotto this is just a
regular<00:02:27.500> speed<00:02:27.920> ring<00:02:28.130> like<00:02:28.280> we<00:02:28.430> use<00:02:28.640> for<00:02:28.880> a

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
regular speed ring like we use for a

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.290 
regular speed ring like we use for a
strobe<00:02:29.300> head<00:02:30.280> this<00:02:31.280> is<00:02:31.340> actually<00:02:31.819> one<00:02:31.970> from<00:02:32.150> my

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
strobe head this is actually one from my

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.780 
strobe head this is actually one from my
speed<00:02:32.569> at<00:02:32.690> ron's<00:02:32.930> so<00:02:33.920> if<00:02:33.980> we<00:02:34.069> take<00:02:34.220> the<00:02:34.370> box<00:02:34.400> off

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
speed at ron's so if we take the box off

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:43.780 
speed at ron's so if we take the box off
let<00:02:35.090> me<00:02:35.120> show<00:02:35.269> you<00:02:35.300> what<00:02:35.510> we've<00:02:35.660> got<00:02:42.730> now<00:02:43.730> you

let me show you what we've got now you
can<00:02:43.970> see<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:44.269> speed<00:02:44.510> ring<00:02:44.690> just<00:02:44.900> kind<00:02:45.080> of

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
can see the speed ring just kind of

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.130 
can see the speed ring just kind of
floats<00:02:45.940> if<00:02:46.940> you<00:02:47.090> loosen<00:02:47.450> this<00:02:47.540> arm<00:02:47.810> up<00:02:47.959> this

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
floats if you loosen this arm up this

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:49.420 
floats if you loosen this arm up this
can<00:02:48.319> go<00:02:48.440> over<00:02:48.590> you<00:02:48.829> want<00:02:49.010> it<00:02:49.099> to<00:02:49.190> and<00:02:49.310> it's

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
can go over you want it to and it's

can go over you want it to and it's
attached<00:02:49.760> with<00:02:49.970> a<00:02:50.000> big<00:02:50.180> clamp<00:02:50.540> some<00:02:51.380> lights<00:02:51.650> is

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
attached with a big clamp some lights is

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.030 
attached with a big clamp some lights is
on<00:02:52.190> on<00:02:52.400> the<00:02:52.640> stand<00:02:52.940> like<00:02:53.180> normal<00:02:53.599> and<00:02:53.920> then<00:02:54.920> you

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
on on the stand like normal and then you

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.059 
on on the stand like normal and then you
just<00:02:55.220> set<00:02:55.459> this<00:02:55.610> up<00:02:55.670> and<00:02:56.440> lock<00:02:57.440> it<00:02:57.620> down<00:02:57.769> with<00:02:58.040> a

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
just set this up and lock it down with a

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:04.420 
just set this up and lock it down with a
turn<00:03:01.060> so<00:03:02.060> to<00:03:02.120> put<00:03:02.269> it<00:03:02.390> back<00:03:02.510> together<00:03:03.430> I'll

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
turn so to put it back together I'll

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:11.920 
turn so to put it back together I'll
just<00:03:04.730> loosen<00:03:05.120> this<00:03:05.239> arm<00:03:10.420> we'll<00:03:11.420> set<00:03:11.660> up<00:03:11.690> our

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
just loosen this arm we'll set up our

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:26.810 
just loosen this arm we'll set up our
soft<00:03:12.230> box<00:03:12.530> again<00:03:12.950> on<00:03:13.220> the<00:03:13.430> speed<00:03:13.700> ring

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.440 

we<00:03:27.820> can<00:03:28.000> kind<00:03:28.120> of<00:03:28.240> just<00:03:28.300> rough<00:03:28.660> it<00:03:28.840> in<00:03:28.960> place

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
we can kind of just rough it in place

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.670 
we can kind of just rough it in place
this<00:03:31.450> one<00:03:31.660> works<00:03:31.870> better<00:03:32.110> if<00:03:32.350> it's<00:03:32.470> set

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
this one works better if it's set

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.870 
this one works better if it's set
vertically<00:03:33.160> because<00:03:33.250> it<00:03:33.430> gives<00:03:33.490> me<00:03:33.670> a<00:03:33.700> little

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
vertically because it gives me a little

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.650 
vertically because it gives me a little
more<00:03:34.060> room<00:03:34.270> to<00:03:34.480> work<00:03:36.240> so<00:03:37.240> I'm<00:03:37.300> going<00:03:37.450> to<00:03:37.480> lock

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
more room to work so I'm going to lock

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.250 
more room to work so I'm going to lock
it<00:03:37.840> down<00:03:37.990> just<00:03:38.260> turn<00:03:38.470> this<00:03:38.620> handle<00:03:39.990> now<00:03:40.990> we<00:03:41.050> can

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
it down just turn this handle now we can

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.020 
it down just turn this handle now we can
open<00:03:41.380> up<00:03:41.620> the<00:03:41.770> front<00:03:42.010> and<00:03:42.220> drop<00:03:42.400> the<00:03:42.550> box<00:03:42.760> back

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
open up the front and drop the box back

00:03:43.030 --> 00:04:00.150 
open up the front and drop the box back
in<00:03:43.270> oops<00:03:57.930> then<00:03:58.930> one<00:03:59.260> more<00:03:59.470> adjustment<00:03:59.560> and

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
in oops then one more adjustment and

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:13.039 
in oops then one more adjustment and
when

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.119 

so<00:04:14.049> obviously<00:04:14.470> there's<00:04:14.680> got<00:04:14.829> to<00:04:14.950> be<00:04:14.980> a<00:04:15.069> better

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:15.129 
so obviously there's got to be a better

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:17.490 
so obviously there's got to be a better
way<00:04:15.519> to<00:04:15.549> do<00:04:15.819> this<00:04:15.959> larson's<00:04:16.959> in<00:04:17.049> the<00:04:17.139> process

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
way to do this larson's in the process

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.259 
way to do this larson's in the process
come<00:04:17.739> out<00:04:17.889> with<00:04:18.070> some<00:04:18.220> nice<00:04:18.430> boxes<00:04:18.669> forced

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
come out with some nice boxes forced

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:20.580 
come out with some nice boxes forced
it'll<00:04:19.479> take<00:04:19.630> all<00:04:19.810> these<00:04:19.989> hybrid<00:04:20.410> light

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
it'll take all these hybrid light

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.520 
it'll take all these hybrid light
sources<00:04:21.039> whether<00:04:21.220> it's<00:04:21.459> an<00:04:21.579> LED<00:04:21.970> panel<00:04:22.360> or

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
sources whether it's an LED panel or

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.350 
sources whether it's an LED panel or
compact<00:04:23.530> fluorescent<00:04:24.039> light<00:04:24.190> or<00:04:24.430> even<00:04:25.150> one<00:04:25.270> of
