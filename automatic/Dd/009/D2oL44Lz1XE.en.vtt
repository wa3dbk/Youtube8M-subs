00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.359 
raise my turbine a little higher and put
some<00:00:19.020> guy<00:00:19.199> wires<00:00:19.470> on<00:00:19.680> that<00:00:19.830> thing<00:00:20.010> is<00:00:20.220> it's

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.849 
nothing on sturdy and basically I chose
to<00:00:23.580> do<00:00:23.699> like<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:23.910> 12<00:00:24.300> I<00:00:24.720> think<00:00:24.930> it's<00:00:25.019> about<00:00:25.170> 13

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859

foot<00:00:26.160> total<00:00:26.640> to<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.269> center<00:00:27.480> of<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.660> blades

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
foot total to the center of the blades

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.720 
foot total to the center of the blades
and<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.349> reason<00:00:28.619> why<00:00:28.740> I<00:00:28.800> did<00:00:29.010> that<00:00:29.039> was<00:00:29.400> simply

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
and the reason why I did that was simply

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.179 
and the reason why I did that was simply
because<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.900> neighborhood<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:31.380> live<00:00:31.560> in<00:00:31.769> I

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
because the neighborhood I live in I

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.350 
because the neighborhood I live in I
just<00:00:32.579> don't<00:00:32.700> think<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.030> interment

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
just don't think the interment

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.310 
just don't think the interment
appreciate<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.550> 25-foot<00:00:35.550> mast<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.809> such<00:00:37.020> so

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
appreciate a 25-foot mast and such so

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.650 
appreciate a 25-foot mast and such so
it's<00:00:37.350> got<00:00:37.680> wires<00:00:37.920> so<00:00:38.250> I<00:00:38.460> had<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.239> keep<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:39.600> a

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
it's got wires so I had to keep it a

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.250 
it's got wires so I had to keep it a
little<00:00:39.809> shorter<00:00:40.320> but<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:40.680> know<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:40.860> works

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
little shorter but you know it works

market I don't know I'm happy with the

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.270 
market I don't know I'm happy with the
may<00:02:00.140> I<00:02:00.170> spit<00:02:00.470> on<00:02:00.590> it<00:02:00.770> and<00:02:00.860> it<00:02:00.979> works<00:02:01.130> pretty

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
may I spit on it and it works pretty

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.279 
may I spit on it and it works pretty
well<00:02:01.430> I'm<00:02:02.090> sure<00:02:02.509> there's<00:02:02.690> other<00:02:02.840> out<00:02:03.110> there

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:03.289 
well I'm sure there's other out there

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:05.050 
well I'm sure there's other out there
that<00:02:03.500> but<00:02:03.619> that<00:02:03.979> may<00:02:04.100> perform<00:02:04.369> better<00:02:04.759> but

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
that but that may perform better but

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.820 
that but that may perform better but

and give you a little a little view of

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.650 
and give you a little a little view of
the<00:02:20.260> new<00:02:21.260> stuff<00:02:21.530> I<00:02:21.650> kind<00:02:21.920> of<00:02:21.980> added<00:02:22.310> on<00:02:22.430> my<00:02:22.660> my

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
the new stuff I kind of added on my my

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.759 
the new stuff I kind of added on my my
panel<00:02:24.050> here<00:02:25.060> see<00:02:26.060> if<00:02:26.090> I<00:02:26.269> can<00:02:26.360> get<00:02:26.450> a<00:02:26.769> little

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
panel here see if I can get a little

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:29.470 
panel here see if I can get a little
shed<00:02:28.040> it's<00:02:28.400> hard<00:02:28.549> to<00:02:28.610> get<00:02:28.760> a<00:02:28.790> good<00:02:28.850> shot<00:02:29.030> here

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
shed it's hard to get a good shot here

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.840 
shed it's hard to get a good shot here
but<00:02:30.380> uh<00:02:30.410> basically<00:02:31.310> you<00:02:31.430> can<00:02:31.519> see<00:02:31.640> there's<00:02:31.819> a

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
but uh basically you can see there's a

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.670 
but uh basically you can see there's a
couple<00:02:31.970> new<00:02:32.209> things<00:02:32.239> on<00:02:32.690> the<00:02:32.900> on<00:02:33.140> the<00:02:33.200> pitcher

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
couple new things on the on the pitcher

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.740 
couple new things on the on the pitcher
obviously<00:02:34.459> one<00:02:34.940> of<00:02:34.970> the<00:02:35.060> first<00:02:35.360> things<00:02:35.480> you're

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
obviously one of the first things you're

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.009 
obviously one of the first things you're
going<00:02:35.840> to<00:02:35.959> see<00:02:36.769> is<00:02:36.950> a<00:02:36.980> good<00:02:37.340> time<00:02:37.940> order<00:02:38.390> so

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
going to see is a good time order so

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:40.840 
going to see is a good time order so
that<00:02:39.530> is<00:02:39.950> something<00:02:40.160> I'm<00:02:40.430> getting<00:02:40.670> ready<00:02:40.760> to

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
that is something I'm getting ready to

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.410 
that is something I'm getting ready to
start<00:02:41.090> doing<00:02:42.220> getting<00:02:43.220> rid<00:02:43.370> of<00:02:43.400> my<00:02:43.610> dump<00:02:44.209> load

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
start doing getting rid of my dump load

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.509 
start doing getting rid of my dump load
at<00:02:44.570> least<00:02:44.750> I'm<00:02:44.900> going<00:02:45.019> to<00:02:45.140> pull<00:02:45.709> it<00:02:45.829> off<00:02:46.010> as<00:02:46.250> far

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
at least I'm going to pull it off as far

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:50.310 
at least I'm going to pull it off as far
as<00:02:46.930> just<00:02:47.930> replacing<00:02:48.380> it<00:02:48.470> with<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:48.799> grid<00:02:49.250> tie

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.070 
watt inverter here but dude just the
lights<00:03:55.250> idea<00:03:56.000> being<00:03:56.210> that<00:03:56.330> my<00:03:56.660> shed<00:03:56.870> lights

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.080 
lights idea being that my shed lights

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:58.990 
lights idea being that my shed lights
would<00:03:57.260> run<00:03:57.470> entirely<00:03:58.040> from<00:03:58.340> that<00:03:58.550> dedicated

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
would run entirely from that dedicated

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.690 
would run entirely from that dedicated
inverter<00:03:59.330> and<00:03:59.570> now<00:04:00.170> we<00:04:00.230> need<00:04:00.590> a<00:04:00.620> 750<00:04:01.250> watt<00:04:01.430> to

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
inverter and now we need a 750 watt to

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.040 
inverter and now we need a 750 watt to
handle<00:04:03.310> dangerous<00:04:04.310> tools<00:04:05.120> or<00:04:05.510> you<00:04:05.930> know

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:06.050 
handle dangerous tools or you know

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.820 
handle dangerous tools or you know
whatever<00:04:06.230> I<00:04:06.410> need<00:04:06.590> to<00:04:06.620> do<00:04:08.320> one<00:04:09.320> thing<00:04:09.350> I<00:04:09.620> wanted

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
whatever I need to do one thing I wanted

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:11.650 
whatever I need to do one thing I wanted
to<00:04:09.890> show<00:04:09.950> that<00:04:10.430> was<00:04:10.670> kind<00:04:10.850> of<00:04:10.910> interesting<00:04:11.030> was

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
to show that was kind of interesting was

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.380 
to show that was kind of interesting was
when<00:04:12.020> i<00:04:12.560> was<00:04:12.710> first<00:04:12.890> hooking<00:04:13.250> up<00:04:13.400> my<00:04:13.580> turbine<00:04:14.120> I

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
when i was first hooking up my turbine I

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.710 
when i was first hooking up my turbine I
I<00:04:14.870> let<00:04:15.590> it<00:04:15.710> free<00:04:15.890> will<00:04:16.100> one<00:04:16.370> night<00:04:16.610> and<00:04:16.940> just

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
I let it free will one night and just

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.360 
I let it free will one night and just
got<00:04:17.900> a<00:04:17.989> lazy<00:04:18.260> and<00:04:18.560> didn't<00:04:18.770> finish<00:04:18.890> hooking<00:04:19.130> up

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
got a lazy and didn't finish hooking up

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:22.840 
got a lazy and didn't finish hooking up
the<00:04:19.489> batteries<00:04:19.940> and<00:04:20.150> this<00:04:20.750> piece<00:04:20.989> here<00:04:21.260> and<00:04:21.850> we

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:22.850 
the batteries and this piece here and we

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:26.170 
the batteries and this piece here and we
got<00:04:23.030> so<00:04:23.210> much<00:04:23.330> wind<00:04:23.650> that<00:04:24.650> the<00:04:24.860> vault<00:04:25.820> the

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
got so much wind that the vault the

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.680 
got so much wind that the vault the
meter<00:04:26.450> are<00:04:26.780> the<00:04:27.290> gauge<00:04:28.220> actually<00:04:29.210> got<00:04:29.360> stuck

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
meter are the gauge actually got stuck

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.280 
meter are the gauge actually got stuck
it<00:04:30.200> actually<00:04:30.410> went<00:04:30.710> all<00:04:30.920> the<00:04:31.040> way<00:04:31.070> over<00:04:31.430> and

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:32.290 
it actually went all the way over and

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.440 
it actually went all the way over and
it's<00:04:33.290> stuck<00:04:33.620> I<00:04:33.890> mean<00:04:34.130> it<00:04:34.280> buried<00:04:34.610> itself<00:04:34.880> in<00:04:35.150> so

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
it's stuck I mean it buried itself in so

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.420 
it's stuck I mean it buried itself in so
I<00:04:35.810> mean<00:04:36.350> I<00:04:36.620> guess<00:04:36.800> I<00:04:36.920> was<00:04:37.070> getting<00:04:37.280> you<00:04:37.400> know

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
I mean I guess I was getting you know

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.610 
I mean I guess I was getting you know
probably<00:04:37.760> up<00:04:37.940> there<00:04:38.090> around<00:04:38.360> 30<00:04:38.660> 40<00:04:39.020> 50<00:04:39.260> votes

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
probably up there around 30 40 50 votes

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.830 
probably up there around 30 40 50 votes
give<00:04:39.920> or<00:04:40.010> take<00:04:40.130> during<00:04:40.370> gust<00:04:40.700> and<00:04:40.970> it<00:04:41.600> flat<00:04:41.810> out

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
give or take during gust and it flat out

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.520 
give or take during gust and it flat out
buried<00:04:42.410> it<00:04:43.390> probably<00:04:44.390> try<00:04:44.540> taking<00:04:45.020> a<00:04:45.050> reverse

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
buried it probably try taking a reverse

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.200 
buried it probably try taking a reverse
the<00:04:45.680> polarity<00:04:46.100> and<00:04:46.190> see<00:04:46.370> if<00:04:46.490> I<00:04:46.640> can<00:04:46.820> switch<00:04:47.060> the

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
the polarity and see if I can switch the

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:48.880 
the polarity and see if I can switch the
negative<00:04:47.510> positive<00:04:47.690> and<00:04:48.080> get<00:04:48.500> it<00:04:48.590> to<00:04:48.710> switch

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:48.890 
negative positive and get it to switch

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.400 
negative positive and get it to switch
back<00:04:49.100> but<00:04:49.430> you<00:04:50.300> know<00:04:50.390> it's<00:04:50.600> not<00:04:50.720> a<00:04:50.780> big<00:04:50.960> deal<00:04:50.990> I

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
back but you know it's not a big deal I

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.400 
back but you know it's not a big deal I
plan<00:04:51.710> on<00:04:51.860> actually<00:04:52.010> pulling<00:04:52.400> muscles<00:04:52.880> out

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
plan on actually pulling muscles out

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:55.750 
plan on actually pulling muscles out
there<00:04:54.410> not<00:04:54.590> I<00:04:54.770> mean<00:04:54.950> I'm<00:04:55.010> not<00:04:55.160> doing<00:04:55.520> exactly

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:55.760 
there not I mean I'm not doing exactly

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.300 
there not I mean I'm not doing exactly
what<00:04:55.940> I<00:04:56.060> was<00:04:56.210> hoping<00:04:56.270> to<00:04:56.570> do<00:04:56.690> with<00:04:56.840> them<00:04:56.990> so<00:04:57.380> and

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
what I was hoping to do with them so and

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:59.760 
what I was hoping to do with them so and
the<00:04:58.520> information<00:04:58.940> I'm<00:04:59.030> getting<00:04:59.270> from<00:04:59.480> the

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
the information I'm getting from the

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.560 
the information I'm getting from the
prostar<00:05:00.770> they're<00:05:01.550> showing<00:05:02.000> us<00:05:02.180> see<00:05:02.330> I've<00:05:02.540> got

turbine<00:05:33.410> cups<00:05:33.710> I<00:05:34.330> was<00:05:35.330> reading<00:05:35.570> the<00:05:35.630> label

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
turbine cups I was reading the label

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.890 
turbine cups I was reading the label
there<00:05:36.370> and<00:05:37.370> just<00:05:37.940> can't<00:05:38.240> give<00:05:38.360> you<00:05:38.450> an<00:05:38.510> idea<00:05:38.600> of

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
there and just can't give you an idea of

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.440 
there and just can't give you an idea of
what's<00:05:39.170> going<00:05:39.320> on<00:05:39.470> here<00:05:39.770> is<00:05:39.920> when<00:05:40.820> I<00:05:41.000> turned<00:05:41.360> my

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:41.450 
what's going on here is when I turned my

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:44.830 
what's going on here is when I turned my
lights<00:05:41.690> off<00:05:42.280> that<00:05:43.280> cranks<00:05:43.670> back<00:05:43.790> up<00:05:43.850> my<00:05:44.480> amsco

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
lights off that cranks back up my amsco

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.830 
lights off that cranks back up my amsco
back<00:05:45.050> up<00:05:45.260> turn<00:05:46.040> my<00:05:46.160> lights<00:05:46.370> on<00:05:46.630> so<00:05:47.630> that's<00:05:47.780> how

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 
back up turn my lights on so that's how

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.770 
back up turn my lights on so that's how
much<00:05:48.050> the<00:05:48.200> draw<00:05:48.440> has<00:05:48.770> come<00:05:49.340> out

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:50.780 
much the draw has come out

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.530 
much the draw has come out
and<00:05:51.500> then<00:05:51.770> eventually<00:05:52.310> I<00:05:52.910> hope<00:05:53.210> the<00:05:53.330> bells

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:53.540 
and then eventually I hope the bells

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.240 
and then eventually I hope the bells
flip<00:05:54.020> that<00:05:54.139> switch<00:05:54.320> and<00:05:54.650> go<00:05:54.740> to<00:05:54.950> goodtime

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250 
flip that switch and go to goodtime

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:58.210 
flip that switch and go to goodtime
battery<00:05:55.820> charge<00:05:56.090> and<00:05:56.560> accordingly<00:05:57.560> I<00:05:57.860> just
