 nevertheless today i would like 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.640
 talk not about how interesting 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.920

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.800
 look at the base platformer elemental 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:35.260
 designed this wonder studio or jeans 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.570
 I hope I read correctly and that's it 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.469
 really just a stage hall this 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.300
 platformer 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:42.190
 which we are offered to travel on 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.870
 the world behind her is capable of and represents 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.879
 one of the four 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.980
 the elements you can be fire bubble 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:50.469
 air stones or a piece of ice just 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.600
 so you will not be allowed to move for this 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:54.850
 need to use facebook wall rushing 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.140
 between a different state for example you 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.640
 rise bubbles higher 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.019
 turn to stone fly 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.000
 further accelerate the earth 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:02.559
 turn into ice slide along the slope 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.420
 under jump on a natural springboard 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:06.220
 turn into the air fly through 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.840
 lava and so on for each of 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.030
 states are and such enhanced 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.009
 action jerk if you can bubble 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.229
 climb up stone accelerate into not 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:16.299
 with ice nothing but it melts 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.460
 turns into water from touching 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:19.840
 with glory, well, and the fire, he explodes 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.850
 provides the most movement 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.619
 all this is done for a reason 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.390
 you need a set of state actions for 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.549
 order to lead a creature through 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.070
 levels to the eyeballs downtrodden various 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:31.990
 whole world puzzle 4 is different 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.060
 each color late but 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.399
 puzzle here is not simple it 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.229
 certainly not super meat boy but agility 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:39.640
 hands and the inclusion of Moscow demanding 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.189
 graphic design is pretty here 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.960
 simple but very nice front 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:46.270
 plan on reminds limbo a 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.770
 back botany puddles and whether it 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.810
 the combination actually looks 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.060
 beautiful enough but what is there just 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.280
 stitches with new ones so this is local music 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.990
 compositions so awesome that sometimes 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.590
 just want to do nothing and sit 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.570
 and listen 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.310
 however if you try to commit whatever 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.200
 whatever the action is in the process then the game 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.390
 gets its own specific look off 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.729
 does not carry you to the chain 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.950
 her in my opinion the main problem on 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.050
 currently it is available only on pc 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.000
 and sitting in front of the monitor at night in 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.590
 no matter how good the headphones are 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.599
 solution to hike in 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.310
 I would like to see her on the playstation 3 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:21.769
 where she would be able to make up 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.959
 excellent company for the journey but if for 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.310
 jorni she's all about meditation then 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.200
 there are all the elements pretty 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.209
 thoughtful gameplay in which you must 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.160
 act that's why you're from 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.450
 options falls port on the tablets 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.519
 home management practically 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.459
 impossible to adjust to such a rhythm 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:39.680
 however, if that happened then 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.540
 such physics games should be and 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.000
 sold millions of copies they 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.769
 crocodile svompy skat zarudny but i 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.140
 as always distracted as it were 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.720
 element definitely deserves attention 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.000
 she is a beautiful kind of difficulty 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.980
 amazing sound content well and 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.510

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.790

 on review thanks to this i already learned about 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:09.109
 two amazing games that are for their 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:13.460
 size as it flew in the shadows 3 play 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:16.230
 project comment more before meetings 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.610
 as the project is purely multiplayer 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:19.920
 worth talking about the network component 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.650
 and here everything is actually pretty 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.500
 controversial for the regimes the cat cried this 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.970
 defmatch team battle and you need to think 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.460
 when to use what 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.140
 but your main weapon which you 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:34.760
 you will use absolutely always 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.760
 is katana
