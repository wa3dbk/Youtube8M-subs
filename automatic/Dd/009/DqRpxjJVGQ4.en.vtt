00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
everyone same here in back with a couple

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.660 
everyone same here in back with a couple
full<00:00:03.540> of<00:00:03.720> videos<00:00:04.200> I'm<00:00:04.350> going<00:00:04.500> to<00:00:04.620> do<00:00:04.799> one<00:00:05.549> in

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
full of videos I'm going to do one in

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.220 
full of videos I'm going to do one in
particular<00:00:06.150> is<00:00:06.330> I<00:00:06.540> had<00:00:06.720> a<00:00:06.750> few<00:00:07.020> questions

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
particular is I had a few questions

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.610 
particular is I had a few questions
about<00:00:07.770> the<00:00:08.519> sliding<00:00:09.090> torch<00:00:09.540> head<00:00:09.780> but<00:00:10.290> I<00:00:10.380> made

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
about the sliding torch head but I made

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.799 
about the sliding torch head but I made
that<00:00:11.370> does<00:00:11.550> not<00:00:11.700> have<00:00:11.880> electrical<00:00:12.389> contact

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
that does not have electrical contact

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:13.999 
that does not have electrical contact
with<00:00:13.049> the

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
with the

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.820 
with the
if<00:00:14.549> you<00:00:14.820> get<00:00:15.330> in<00:00:15.480> a<00:00:15.539> bit<00:00:15.690> closer<00:00:15.900> in<00:00:16.260> my

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
if you get in a bit closer in my

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.260 
if you get in a bit closer in my
cameraman<00:00:17.310> can<00:00:17.490> get<00:00:17.580> in<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.730> bit<00:00:17.880> closer<00:00:18.090> here

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
cameraman can get in a bit closer here

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.600 
cameraman can get in a bit closer here
you<00:00:18.930> can<00:00:19.110> see<00:00:19.320> here<00:00:19.710> is<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:19.859> little<00:00:20.070> switch<00:00:20.869> and

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:22.610 
you can see here is a little switch and

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.580 
you can see here is a little switch and
the<00:00:23.610> torch<00:00:23.849> actually<00:00:24.270> moves<00:00:24.480> up<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:24.779> down<00:00:24.840> so

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
the torch actually moves up and down so

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.439 
the torch actually moves up and down so
I'm<00:00:26.130> pushing<00:00:26.400> it<00:00:26.579> up<00:00:26.669> again<00:00:26.880> with<00:00:26.970> my<00:00:27.119> finger

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
I'm pushing it up again with my finger

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.380 
I'm pushing it up again with my finger
here<00:00:27.570> so<00:00:28.279> that's<00:00:29.279> that<00:00:29.610> when<00:00:29.880> that<00:00:30.029> towards

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
here so that's that when that towards

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.290 
here so that's that when that towards
triggers<00:00:30.869> it's<00:00:31.740> telling<00:00:32.189> Mac<00:00:32.400> that<00:00:32.640> we've

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
triggers it's telling Mac that we've

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.869 
triggers it's telling Mac that we've
found<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.660> surface<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.710> backs<00:00:34.980> off<00:00:35.190> if

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:35.879 
found the surface and it backs off if

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:38.360 
found the surface and it backs off if
you<00:00:36.030> look<00:00:36.210> up<00:00:36.330> on<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.600> screen<00:00:36.629> here<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.370> don't

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
you look up on the screen here and don't

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.310 
you look up on the screen here and don't
get<00:00:38.489> confused<00:00:38.730> by<00:00:39.059> my<00:00:39.330> screen<00:00:39.660> because<00:00:40.019> I've

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
get confused by my screen because I've

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.750 
get confused by my screen because I've
really<00:00:41.070> made<00:00:41.250> my<00:00:41.460> whole<00:00:41.670> screen<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.150> suit<00:00:42.360> me

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
really made my whole screen to suit me

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.639 
really made my whole screen to suit me
when<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:45.000> look<00:00:45.570> here<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:45.900> can<00:00:45.930> still<00:00:46.230> have<00:00:46.469> my

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
when you look here you can still have my

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.029 
when you look here you can still have my
torch<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:47.070> control<00:00:47.520> here<00:00:48.289> up<00:00:49.289> here<00:00:49.379> if<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:49.890> go

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
torch I control here up here if you go

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.549 
torch I control here up here if you go
into<00:00:50.219> operator<00:00:51.649> BB<00:00:52.649> script<00:00:53.039> editor<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:54.410> have<00:00:55.410> an

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
into operator BB script editor I have an

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.299 
into operator BB script editor I have an
M<00:00:55.710> code<00:00:55.980> which<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.460> just<00:00:56.730> called<00:00:56.969> M<00:00:57.120> code<00:00:57.359> 25<00:00:58.309> now

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
M code which I just called M code 25 now

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.240 
M code which I just called M code 25 now
this<00:00:59.489> this<00:00:59.820> M<00:01:00.059> code<00:01:00.359> here<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:01.559> actually<00:01:02.070> what

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
this this M code here is actually what

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.779 
this this M code here is actually what
does<00:01:02.460> all<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.730> work<00:01:02.760> so<00:01:03.379> I<00:01:04.399> have<00:01:05.399> a<00:01:05.460> couple<00:01:05.729> of

00:01:05.779 --> 00:01:05.789 
does all the work so I have a couple of

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:07.850 
does all the work so I have a couple of
parameters<00:01:06.210> up<00:01:06.330> here<00:01:06.539> I've<00:01:06.690> set<00:01:06.960> current<00:01:07.530> feed

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
parameters up here I've set current feed

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.230 
parameters up here I've set current feed
speed<00:01:08.210> that's<00:01:09.210> that<00:01:09.720> gets<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.320> from<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.679> Dro

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
speed that's that gets that from the Dro

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.240 
speed that's that gets that from the Dro
piece<00:01:12.240> height<00:01:12.539> now<00:01:12.840> piece<00:01:13.200> pearce<00:01:13.679> height<00:01:13.950> is

piece height now piece pearce height is

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.600 
piece height now piece pearce height is
when<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.600> probe<00:01:16.320> touches<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.890> job<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.399> backs

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
when the probe touches the job and backs

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.969 
when the probe touches the job and backs
off<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:18.479> backs<00:01:18.780> off<00:01:18.990> whatever<00:01:19.259> this<00:01:19.560> height<00:01:19.770> is

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
off it backs off whatever this height is

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.529 
off it backs off whatever this height is
here<00:01:20.220> now<00:01:20.490> are<00:01:20.610> here<00:01:20.819> off<00:01:20.940> telling<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.360> go

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:21.539 
here now are here off telling it to go

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:23.809 
here now are here off telling it to go
up<00:01:21.690> minus<00:01:22.080> 4<00:01:22.319> and<00:01:22.619> that's<00:01:23.130> just<00:01:23.399> feed<00:01:23.670> speed

00:01:23.809 --> 00:01:23.819 
up minus 4 and that's just feed speed

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:28.969 
up minus 4 and that's just feed speed

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
that probes down g90 is zeroing

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.130 
that probes down g90 is zeroing
everything<00:01:29.369> out<00:01:29.520> F<00:01:29.789> is<00:01:30.599> the<00:01:30.780> feed<00:01:30.989> speed

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
everything out F is the feed speed

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.350 
everything out F is the feed speed
traveling<00:01:31.800> down<00:01:31.979> this<00:01:32.459> is<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.789> probe<00:01:33.030> speed

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
traveling down this is the probe speed

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.609 
traveling down this is the probe speed
here<00:01:33.599> that<00:01:34.140> we<00:01:34.560> set<00:01:34.739> up<00:01:34.770> here<00:01:36.259> this<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.500> the

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
here that we set up here this is the

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.040 
here that we set up here this is the
main<00:01:37.800> bit<00:01:38.009> of<00:01:38.099> code<00:01:38.390> this<00:01:39.390> G<00:01:39.750> 31<00:01:40.259> 0<00:01:40.289> US<00:01:41.009> 117

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
main bit of code this G 31 0 US 117

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:48.499 
main bit of code this G 31 0 US 117
that's<00:01:43.050> that<00:01:43.560> G<00:01:43.860> 31<00:01:44.369> is<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.789> the<00:01:45.239> probe<00:01:46.550> zd-<00:01:47.550> 117

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
that's that G 31 is is the probe zd- 117

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.059 
that's that G 31 is is the probe zd- 117
I<00:01:48.599> actually<00:01:48.780> measured<00:01:49.319> how<00:01:49.470> far<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:49.860> was<00:01:50.039> from

00:01:50.059 --> 00:01:50.069 
I actually measured how far it was from

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:53.419 
I actually measured how far it was from
0<00:01:50.849> from<00:01:51.300> 0<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.989> the<00:01:52.319> table<00:01:52.739> and<00:01:53.069> it<00:01:53.280> was<00:01:53.310> a

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:53.429 
0 from 0 to the table and it was a

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:55.219 
0 from 0 to the table and it was a
hundred<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:53.880> sixteen<00:01:54.360> millimeters<00:01:54.869> so<00:01:55.020> here

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
hundred and sixteen millimeters so here

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.880 
hundred and sixteen millimeters so here
I'm<00:01:55.410> telling<00:01:55.739> G<00:01:56.069> 31<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:57.690> can<00:01:57.959> travel<00:01:58.259> down<00:01:58.410> a

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
I'm telling G 31 it can travel down a

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.160 
I'm telling G 31 it can travel down a
hundred<00:01:59.099> and<00:01:59.429> seventeen<00:01:59.819> millimeters<00:02:00.360> if<00:02:00.869> it

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
hundred and seventeen millimeters if it

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.830 
hundred and seventeen millimeters if it
doesn't<00:02:01.649> find<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.160> table<00:02:02.459> in<00:02:02.819> that<00:02:03.000> in<00:02:03.509> that

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
doesn't find the table in that in that

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.260 
doesn't find the table in that in that

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
there's an error the plate got grounded

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.850 
there's an error the plate got grounded
and<00:02:10.979> it<00:02:11.489> will<00:02:11.610> go<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.790> a<00:02:11.910> soap<00:02:12.180> set<00:02:12.420> if<00:02:13.379> it<00:02:13.620> does

and it will go to a soap set if it does

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.240

117<00:02:20.300> it<00:02:21.300> then<00:02:22.340> comes<00:02:23.340> up<00:02:23.490> here<00:02:23.760> probies<00:02:24.360> and

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
117 it then comes up here probies and

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.530 
117 it then comes up here probies and
tells<00:02:25.230> me<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.470> height<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.800> probe<00:02:26.010> that

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
tells me the height the probe that

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.360 
tells me the height the probe that
resets<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:28.080> Z<00:02:28.709> to<00:02:29.190> zero<00:02:29.459> at<00:02:29.730> that<00:02:30.030> height

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
resets the Z to zero at that height

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.030 
resets the Z to zero at that height
resets<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.520> Dro<00:02:33.260> here<00:02:34.260> is<00:02:34.440> a<00:02:34.470> little<00:02:34.800> bit<00:02:34.890> of<00:02:34.980> a

resets the Dro here is a little bit of a

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.380 
resets the Dro here is a little bit of a
delay<00:02:35.340> so<00:02:35.610> I<00:02:35.970> can<00:02:36.150> do<00:02:36.300> those<00:02:36.480> things<00:02:37.070> 0<00:02:38.070> z<00:02:38.670> 0<00:02:38.820> set

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
delay so I can do those things 0 z 0 set

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.830 
delay so I can do those things 0 z 0 set
to<00:02:39.510> 0<00:02:39.780> T<00:02:40.140> 90<00:02:40.410> to<00:02:40.590> make<00:02:40.830> sure<00:02:41.660> we're<00:02:42.660> getting<00:02:42.720> a

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
to 0 T 90 to make sure we're getting a

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.910 
to 0 T 90 to make sure we're getting a
message<00:02:42.990> on<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.290> bottom<00:02:43.530> of<00:02:43.620> screen<00:02:43.709> that

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
message on the bottom of screen that

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.720 
message on the bottom of screen that
tells<00:02:44.280> me<00:02:44.459> is<00:02:44.550> that<00:02:44.670> as<00:02:44.820> it<00:02:44.970> Pierce<00:02:45.180> height

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
tells me is that as it Pierce height

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.809 
tells me is that as it Pierce height
turns<00:02:47.730> on<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.000> THC<00:02:48.440> max<00:02:49.440> THC<00:02:50.069> controller<00:02:50.520> and

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
turns on the THC max THC controller and

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:56.330 
turns on the THC max THC controller and
zeroes<00:02:51.690> out<00:02:51.870> the<00:02:52.050> THC<00:02:53.480> from<00:02:54.480> there<00:02:55.340> the

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
zeroes out the THC from there the

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.000 
zeroes out the THC from there the
controls<00:02:56.730> give<00:02:56.940> them<00:02:57.030> back<00:02:57.180> to<00:02:57.300> your<00:02:57.390> program

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
controls give them back to your program

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.970 
controls give them back to your program
so<00:02:59.010> I<00:02:59.340> mean<00:03:00.000> I'm<00:03:00.570> focusing<00:03:01.410> on<00:03:01.560> this<00:03:01.680> as<00:03:01.800> long

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
so I mean I'm focusing on this as long

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.770 
so I mean I'm focusing on this as long
as<00:03:02.130> possible<00:03:02.310> so<00:03:02.550> you<00:03:02.700> can<00:03:02.910> get<00:03:03.060> us<00:03:03.180> you<00:03:03.570> get<00:03:03.750> a

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
as possible so you can get us you get a

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.870 
as possible so you can get us you get a
good<00:03:03.959> look<00:03:04.140> at<00:03:04.320> it<00:03:04.380> and<00:03:04.980> can<00:03:05.220> understand<00:03:05.700> what

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
good look at it and can understand what

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.600 
good look at it and can understand what
I've<00:03:06.000> done<00:03:06.180> there<00:03:06.390> it's<00:03:07.200> pretty<00:03:07.500> simple<00:03:07.920> like

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
I've done there it's pretty simple like

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:14.260 
I've done there it's pretty simple like
I<00:03:08.640> sent<00:03:08.970> G<00:03:09.239> 31<00:03:09.780> does<00:03:10.650> all<00:03:10.830> the<00:03:10.950> work

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.180 

and<00:03:14.810> that's<00:03:15.470> it<00:03:15.620> I'll<00:03:16.250> say<00:03:16.850> you're<00:03:17.030> here<00:03:17.150> also

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
and that's it I'll say you're here also

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.770 
and that's it I'll say you're here also
just<00:03:19.190> the<00:03:19.310> truth<00:03:19.520> you<00:03:19.820> how<00:03:20.210> I<00:03:20.240> set<00:03:20.570> up<00:03:20.600> the

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
just the truth you how I set up the

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.930 
just the truth you how I set up the
torch<00:03:21.020> just<00:03:21.830> disconnect<00:03:22.340> that<00:03:22.430> little<00:03:22.700> spring

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
torch just disconnect that little spring

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.310 
torch just disconnect that little spring
there<00:03:23.180> yeah<00:03:25.120> there's<00:03:26.120> my<00:03:26.240> torch<00:03:26.480> now<00:03:26.990> I<00:03:27.020> can

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
there yeah there's my torch now I can

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.900 
there yeah there's my torch now I can
change<00:03:27.530> my<00:03:27.740> tip<00:03:27.950> I<00:03:28.100> can<00:03:28.280> do<00:03:28.370> whatever<00:03:28.520> I<00:03:28.700> need

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
change my tip I can do whatever I need

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.310 
change my tip I can do whatever I need
to<00:03:28.940> do<00:03:29.180> you<00:03:29.660> can<00:03:29.810> see<00:03:30.020> there's<00:03:30.230> nothing

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:30.320 
to do you can see there's nothing

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.200 
to do you can see there's nothing
special<00:03:30.710> here<00:03:30.980> I<00:03:31.040> made<00:03:31.430> this<00:03:31.580> torch<00:03:31.850> holder

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.210 
special here I made this torch holder

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.170 
special here I made this torch holder
there's<00:03:32.840> nothing<00:03:33.140> special<00:03:33.350> in<00:03:33.650> it<00:03:33.880> it's<00:03:34.880> just

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
there's nothing special in it it's just

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.820 
there's nothing special in it it's just
made<00:03:35.390> so<00:03:35.660> that<00:03:35.810> the<00:03:35.930> torch<00:03:36.170> will<00:03:36.380> move<00:03:36.500> up<00:03:36.710> and

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
made so that the torch will move up and

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.510 
made so that the torch will move up and
down<00:03:36.920> inside<00:03:37.310> there<00:03:37.610> a<00:03:38.980> little<00:03:39.980> spring<00:03:40.280> here

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.520 
down inside there a little spring here

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.160 
down inside there a little spring here
just<00:03:40.760> to<00:03:40.880> make<00:03:41.090> sure<00:03:41.300> I've<00:03:41.480> got<00:03:41.660> enough<00:03:41.900> force

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
just to make sure I've got enough force

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.100 
just to make sure I've got enough force
even<00:03:42.890> though<00:03:42.950> it<00:03:43.190> doesn't<00:03:43.430> need<00:03:43.730> it<00:03:43.880> but

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
even though it doesn't need it but

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.930 
even though it doesn't need it but
gravity<00:03:45.110> probably<00:03:45.680> is<00:03:45.770> probably<00:03:45.950> more<00:03:46.730> than

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
gravity probably is probably more than

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:52.320 
gravity probably is probably more than
enough<00:03:47.770> and<00:03:48.770> that's<00:03:49.070> it

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.260
