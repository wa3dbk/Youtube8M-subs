00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 good morning site are young Moorish 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.500
 I'm here at mantova comics and games 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:11.280
 no here with the study i vol and with i 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.920
 comics pebbles or hello and we are here today 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.360
 to do an interview on their site 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.670
 game they are developing up for 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.210
 karima gizio of which precisely is one 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.310
 beautiful t-shirt then I like you 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.630
 It occurred to him that he has a video game 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.130
 I always had in mind the idea of ​​doing 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.140
 they told me a video game 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.630
 we make video game and then I did 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.329
 ok and i said this is my idea and now 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.620
 they told me ok ok let's modify the a 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.870
 and then it seemed like a nice video 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.420
 I play now as states 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.129
 account between you and the developers is 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:47.010
 you immediately got in tune you had 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:49.230
 I hated problems right away 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.149
 love at first sight and they are beautiful and 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.760
 because in any case they seem to me like 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.980
 serious people who also work 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.920
 nice not only that they work otherwise 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.559
 that sucks but we have known it 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.570
 through via lucca and we got there right away 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.900
 also found good because we follow 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.220
 already his work etc immediately liked it 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.790
 so we already knew what we were going for 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.000
 meeting 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.100
 we wanted to meet him and also like people 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.740
 is the same as salespeople demonstrate the movies 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.430
 so it was an open door 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:25.380
 what is the purpose of the game to launch 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:28.140
 things to believe things all of them a 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.700
 win things or his previews that 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.070
 the graphics are precisely the dc comics 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.079
 or how it was for you to produce it 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.060
 then let's say what community it was 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.329
 quite simple but enough 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.920
 laborious because we say he had 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.040
 some problems we say for the 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.420
 animations and it wasn't a technique 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.540
 production is very fast 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.060
 now we have completely changed the 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.990
 visual is now in the past directly 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.090
 at 3 at full 3d so let's say that over 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.060
 at the technique two of you will see it all in 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:03.869
 2d however it will actually be 3d so let's say 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.930
 which creates various small things there 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.000
 help 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.280
 in the production of the video game 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.950
 especially of the contents 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.840
 before it was as if they were drawings 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.790
 facts endless perspective to give 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.590
 the effect of the three-dimensional while 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.690
 gave the true three-dimensional in this 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.459
 so we can also add facts of 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.640
 lighting that is much more 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:27.220
 realistic they add is aesthetically 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.300
 enough value to the final effect 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.709
 of graphics 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.910
 what did you think when he was 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:35.560
 asked that he make a video game with i 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:37.750
 food characters in the sense we do 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.220
 we met we decided everything 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.200
 at the table because we did not have 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:45.250
 absolutely no idea we actually had them 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.290
 proposed a magic fish platform but 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.989
 it was not a good idea 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.459
 and then yes object but we do one 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.470
 Zen style from and we liked the idea 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.180
 because in any case the developers in 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:59.110
 reality always want to do something 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:01.750
 so as a company it is something that is there 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.670
 liked it immediately so this is it 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.350
 was the birth of the idea the collection 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.630
 funds that you have launched to conduct the 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:12.180
 game has been successful 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:14.530
 no longer wanted more money has no money 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.720
 astonished has gone almost twice as much 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.340
 what we asked for and live thanks are 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:22.180
 very grateful it's all beautiful 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:25.540
 thanks for those that make you will succeed 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:31.510
 game android ios and windows phone 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:35.560
 windows linux mac playstation vita wii u 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:37.140
 table clocks and yes there will be 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.360
 following this experience 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:44.370
 no yes maybe 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.880
 in the arena mode with some 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.870
 famous people have decided to join you 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.510
 decided to be one of the protagonists 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:56.100
 that we are daita did not do it on purpose 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:57.750
 that is because it is now the design of me 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:01.950
 himself had become a character in itself 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:05.600
 in other words, well, I have nothing 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.600
 to do we draw the same level 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.230
 when it comes out where we could find it e 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.900
 how much will it cost 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.690
 there is no game in Italy 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.100
 there will probably never be maybe not 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.130
 I know maybe there will be 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.700
 we hope it would be nice though not since then 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:26.630
 and it will be exclusively digital 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:33.210
 will be released in the second half of 2015 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:36.420
 steam su steam and on the various stores and also 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:40.140
 hanball store and on the various stores 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.760
 console or mobile 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:45.870
 according to you the game will be successful 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:47.970
 abroad vote Italy then us 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.800
 we did a green light campaign 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.250
 to be able to be published on 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.290
 steam 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.630
 we had a great response too 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:57.750
 from the foreign market to be customers 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:05:00.360
 let's say we call the customer then 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:04.550
 we think of course all the 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.550
 translation work that will have to do sio 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:11.490
 and it will be very important especially for 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:13.500
 take this kind of market that you don't 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:16.650
 he basically knows us 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.330
 actually this good part of the 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:21.240
 your comedy and also game-based 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:22.980
 of words on jokes that work are 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.290
 Italians we were a little worried about that 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:26.950
 this thing did not arrive English though 

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:29.020
 we beat with the 3 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.510
 in English to present the game to whom 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.070
 he didn't know us and maybe even sio e 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:35.020
 it worked because it really is 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:38.280
 the environment that to this concept of 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:42.550
 sovereignty to do also how to define it 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:44.140
 however many things ok that I cast a lot 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:48.640
 the hand on word games however in 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:50.200
 reality is so much the rhythm of things that 

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.810
 I do is that enough 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:55.930
 international astern 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:58.690
 okay thank the study and thank you 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:01.120

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:04.500
 an upcoming contest review for the 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.500
 site the nerves os.it
