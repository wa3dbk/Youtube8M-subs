00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
so it's real quick um the widget

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.870 
so it's real quick um the widget
container<00:05:34.199> I<00:05:34.560> want<00:05:34.860> to<00:05:35.009> do<00:05:35.190> the<00:05:35.370> box<00:05:35.610> shadow

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
highlighted at ww css3 info and there's

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.610 
highlighted at ww css3 info and there's
different<00:05:45.330> box<00:05:45.509> shadows<00:05:46.050> that<00:05:46.080> you<00:05:46.320> can<00:05:46.500> do

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
different box shadows that you can do

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.969

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:49.979 
but this is going to be all four sides

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:52.640 
but this is going to be all four sides
and<00:05:50.430> we're<00:05:51.360> going<00:05:51.479> to<00:05:51.539> paste<00:05:51.750> that<00:05:51.930> here<00:05:52.409> and

and we're going to paste that here and

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.439 
and we're going to paste that here and
that'll<00:05:52.860> do<00:05:53.070> a<00:05:53.099> box<00:05:53.400> shadow<00:05:53.669> on<00:05:53.969> all<00:05:54.180> four

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:54.449 
that'll do a box shadow on all four

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:57.890 
that'll do a box shadow on all four
sides<00:05:54.479> of<00:05:55.280> each<00:05:56.280> widget<00:05:56.639> container<00:05:57.449> and<00:05:57.719> then

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 
sides of each widget container and then

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.600 
sides of each widget container and then
we're<00:05:58.139> going<00:05:58.259> to<00:05:58.320> leave<00:05:58.590> the<00:05:58.860> rest<00:05:59.099> of<00:05:59.550> that

the worry you're typing the words
content<00:07:29.370> of<00:07:29.580> it<00:07:29.729> okay<00:07:30.180> so<00:07:30.240> let's<00:07:30.630> save<00:07:30.900> that

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:30.930 
content of it okay so let's save that

00:07:30.930 --> 00:07:32.870 
content of it okay so let's save that
and<00:07:31.410> then<00:07:31.590> we'll<00:07:31.770> take<00:07:31.800> a<00:07:32.220> look<00:07:32.430> at<00:07:32.610> what<00:07:32.760> we've

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:32.880 
and then we'll take a look at what we've

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:39.620 
and then we'll take a look at what we've
got<00:07:35.720> all<00:07:36.720> right<00:07:36.780> so<00:07:37.080> let's<00:07:37.470> take<00:07:37.710> a<00:07:37.770> look<00:07:38.630> looks

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:39.630 
got all right so let's take a look looks

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:44.120
