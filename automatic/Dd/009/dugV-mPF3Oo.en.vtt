00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.250
 Looking back you when the four-and-a-half years of racing life far nobody painter 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.450
 Do you mind 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:15.680
 The gap between good times and bad times 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:20.290
 Until it is 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.290
 Especially until that 3 year old spring 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:26.240
 I until the meeting is I Karadasu really that 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.150
 Well I was late but I was too late 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.660
 Take advantage of summer 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.320
 Full-scale 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.660
 Hearing place 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.800
 Climbed to the top 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:40.510
 The place is already so great that last mano 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.510
 The best 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:46.579
 I think it's probably that time Hmmm 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:49.110
 What kind of words do you want to say in the end 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:54.840
 The other is already now a real Well 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:57.890
 I would like to say that it was a hardship for a long time Now to the fans than the owner of the owner Akira Fukui of the Lord 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.890
 There is a greeting 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.700

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:17.479
 There 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:28.170
 I learned a lot from Orken Bruce Lee 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:31.400
 And there are many memories 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:35.380
 Of course there are regrettable feelings 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:39.350
 At the Japan Cup that came out at the age of 4 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.870
 Fight with Bocca in this little tank 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.620
 lost 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:46.350
 The race is the most regrettable in the life of a horse owner 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.890
 It became practice 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:53.090
 But of course there are happy memories 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:57.190
 In this Kyoto racecourse 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:02:04.030
 On the big stage of the Classic Last Kikuka Award

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:13.080
