to be down into the left so if your
light<00:01:59.250> sources<00:01:59.579> down<00:01:59.759> somewhat<00:02:00.299> then<00:02:00.659> how<00:02:00.930> is

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
light sources down somewhat then how is

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.020 
light sources down somewhat then how is
it<00:02:01.140> that<00:02:01.290> you<00:02:01.469> have<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.829> highlight<00:02:02.250> on<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:02.759> top

why is drunks that were going up into

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.970 
why is drunks that were going up into
the<00:02:15.510> right<00:02:15.810> shouldn't<00:02:16.140> it<00:02:16.200> be<00:02:16.260> going<00:02:16.650> down

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
the right shouldn't it be going down

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.190 
the right shouldn't it be going down
into<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.400> right<00:02:17.550> yes<00:02:18.030> it<00:02:18.330> should<00:02:18.570> if<00:02:18.840> you<00:02:18.870> have

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
into the right yes it should if you have

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.050 
into the right yes it should if you have
a<00:02:19.440> light<00:02:19.770> source<00:02:19.980> down<00:02:20.250> here<00:02:20.580> and<00:02:20.820> have<00:02:21.030> a

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
a light source down here and have a

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.310 
a light source down here and have a
light<00:02:21.270> source<00:02:21.390> up<00:02:21.660> here<00:02:21.960> then<00:02:22.200> you<00:02:22.290> should

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
light source up here then you should

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.340 
light source up here then you should
have<00:02:22.650> shadows<00:02:23.070> and<00:02:23.550> highlights

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 
have shadows and highlights

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.780 
have shadows and highlights
corresponding<00:02:25.350> to<00:02:25.560> both<00:02:25.770> light<00:02:26.100> sources<00:02:26.460> and

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
corresponding to both light sources and

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.790 
corresponding to both light sources and
thing<00:02:27.090> I<00:02:27.180> won't<00:02:27.360> talk<00:02:27.540> about<00:02:27.750> is<00:02:27.930> depth<00:02:28.500> depth

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
thing I won't talk about is depth depth

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.070 
thing I won't talk about is depth depth
between<00:02:29.040> your<00:02:29.640> letters<00:02:30.090> and<00:02:30.120> your<00:02:30.330> character

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
between your letters and your character

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.690 
between your letters and your character
your<00:02:31.320> letters<00:02:31.620> have<00:02:31.800> depth<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:32.310> reason<00:02:32.610> maybe

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
your letters have depth the reason maybe

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.340 
your letters have depth the reason maybe
it's<00:02:32.760> because<00:02:32.910> they<00:02:33.060> have<00:02:33.240> 3d<00:02:33.720> on<00:02:33.930> them

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
it's because they have 3d on them

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:35.990 
it's because they have 3d on them
meaning<00:02:34.650> three-dimensional<00:02:35.430> meaning<00:02:35.730> it<00:02:35.850> has

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
meaning three-dimensional meaning it has

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.670 
meaning three-dimensional meaning it has
depth<00:02:36.330> and<00:02:36.510> your<00:02:36.750> character<00:02:37.140> has<00:02:37.290> some<00:02:37.320> shades

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
depth and your character has some shades

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.200 
depth and your character has some shades
in<00:02:37.890> it<00:02:37.980> and<00:02:38.160> some<00:02:38.490> highlights<00:02:38.760> meaning<00:02:39.120> it

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
in it and some highlights meaning it

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.450 
in it and some highlights meaning it
also<00:02:39.330> has<00:02:39.540> that<00:02:39.780> first<00:02:40.050> off<00:02:40.320> you<00:02:40.800> have<00:02:41.040> your

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
also has that first off you have your

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.310 
also has that first off you have your
character's<00:02:41.940> ear<00:02:42.150> right<00:02:42.510> here<00:02:42.570> which<00:02:43.080> is

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
character's ear right here which is

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.340 
character's ear right here which is
obviously<00:02:44.220> behind<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:45.450> head<00:02:45.810> of<00:02:46.020> the

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
obviously behind the head of the

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.370 
obviously behind the head of the
character<00:02:46.590> but<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.100> head<00:02:47.400> is<00:02:47.700> behind<00:02:48.570> the<00:02:49.080> e

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
character but the head is behind the e

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.400 
character but the head is behind the e
but<00:02:49.770> the<00:02:49.890> e<00:02:49.920> is<00:02:50.490> behind<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.600> ears<00:02:51.930> which

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
but the e is behind the ears which

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.130 
but the e is behind the ears which
doesn't<00:02:53.070> make<00:02:53.250> sense<00:02:53.700> that<00:02:54.000> wouldn't<00:02:54.900> happen

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
doesn't make sense that wouldn't happen

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.520 
doesn't make sense that wouldn't happen
in<00:02:55.590> this<00:02:55.890> scenario<00:02:56.670> so<00:02:56.910> to<00:02:57.480> fix<00:02:57.780> this<00:02:57.990> all<00:02:58.260> you

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
in this scenario so to fix this all you

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.550 
in this scenario so to fix this all you
have<00:02:58.560> to<00:02:58.950> do<00:02:59.130> is<00:02:59.400> to<00:02:59.610> put<00:02:59.910> the<00:03:00.090> ear<00:03:00.360> behind<00:03:00.930> the

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
have to do is to put the ear behind the

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.940 
have to do is to put the ear behind the
e<00:03:01.920> like<00:03:02.730> so<00:03:03.030> now<00:03:03.510> the<00:03:03.570> next<00:03:04.200> part<00:03:04.470> I<00:03:04.680> want<00:03:04.830> to

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
e like so now the next part I want to

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.790 
e like so now the next part I want to
talk<00:03:05.040> about<00:03:05.340> is<00:03:05.790> this<00:03:06.540> entire<00:03:07.110> area<00:03:07.440> being

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
talk about is this entire area being

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.070 
talk about is this entire area being
incorrect<00:03:08.550> as<00:03:08.700> far<00:03:08.970> as<00:03:09.150> depth<00:03:09.450> is<00:03:09.630> concerned

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
incorrect as far as depth is concerned

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.010 
incorrect as far as depth is concerned
between<00:03:10.350> your<00:03:10.800> E<00:03:11.040> and<00:03:11.310> your<00:03:11.520> character<00:03:12.060> is

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
between your E and your character is

depth of the 3d into consideration and

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.550 
depth of the 3d into consideration and
push<00:03:35.220> the<00:03:35.430> character<00:03:35.940> back<00:03:36.180> by<00:03:36.570> at<00:03:36.720> least<00:03:36.990> that

push the character back by at least that
death<00:03:37.890> I'd<00:03:38.100> say<00:03:38.370> your<00:03:38.550> best<00:03:38.880> bet<00:03:39.210> to<00:03:39.240> making

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
death I'd say your best bet to making

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.450 
death I'd say your best bet to making
this<00:03:39.870> look<00:03:40.080> better<00:03:40.380> would<00:03:40.770> be<00:03:40.800> to<00:03:40.950> put<00:03:41.310> your

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:41.460 
this look better would be to put your

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:43.790 
this look better would be to put your
character<00:03:41.910> over<00:03:42.209> your<00:03:42.360> e3<00:03:42.840> has<00:03:43.200> enough<00:03:43.500> very

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
character over your e3 has enough very

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.530 
character over your e3 has enough very
distinctive<00:03:44.370> features<00:03:44.730> in<00:03:44.940> order<00:03:45.060> to<00:03:45.209> be<00:03:45.300> seen

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
distinctive features in order to be seen

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.260 
distinctive features in order to be seen
as<00:03:45.840> an<00:03:46.080> E<00:03:46.260> so<00:03:46.590> going<00:03:46.860> over<00:03:47.310> these<00:03:47.640> parts<00:03:48.090> of<00:03:48.150> the

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:48.270 
as an E so going over these parts of the

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:50.390 
as an E so going over these parts of the
e<00:03:48.300> that<00:03:48.750> go<00:03:49.020> on<00:03:49.260> top<00:03:49.560> of<00:03:49.770> the<00:03:49.860> character<00:03:50.250> isn't

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
e that go on top of the character isn't

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.310 
e that go on top of the character isn't
gonna<00:03:50.610> be<00:03:50.790> a<00:03:50.820> problem<00:03:50.880> and<00:03:51.540> pretty<00:03:51.810> much<00:03:51.959> draw

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
gonna be a problem and pretty much draw

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.380 
gonna be a problem and pretty much draw
over<00:03:52.709> any<00:03:52.950> line<00:03:53.220> that<00:03:53.700> overlaps<00:03:54.180> the

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
over any line that overlaps the

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.150 
over any line that overlaps the
character<00:03:54.870> and<00:03:55.080> then<00:03:55.260> go<00:03:55.560> ahead<00:03:55.770> and<00:03:55.920> draw<00:03:56.040> the

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
character and then go ahead and draw the

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.530 
character and then go ahead and draw the
outline<00:03:56.520> of<00:03:56.550> the<00:03:56.640> character<00:03:57.030> and<00:03:57.209> that<00:03:57.270> looks

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
outline of the character and that looks

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.150 
outline of the character and that looks
a<00:03:57.660> lot<00:03:57.780> better<00:03:57.840> than<00:03:58.260> having<00:03:58.470> that<00:03:58.680> you<00:03:58.800> slice

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
a lot better than having that you slice

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.040 
a lot better than having that you slice
into<00:03:59.370> the<00:03:59.520> characters<00:03:59.970> nose<00:04:00.209> or<00:04:00.540> just<00:04:00.870> have

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
into the characters nose or just have

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.620 
into the characters nose or just have
all<00:04:01.350> this<00:04:01.530> fucked<00:04:02.040> up<00:04:02.250> depth<00:04:02.880> that<00:04:03.120> makes<00:04:03.330> no

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
all this fucked up depth that makes no

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.290 
all this fucked up depth that makes no
sense<00:04:03.990> at<00:04:04.140> all<00:04:04.290> moral<00:04:05.040> of<00:04:05.160> the<00:04:05.520> story<00:04:05.550> right

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
sense at all moral of the story right

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
characters with the letters think about

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.840 
characters with the letters think about
how<00:04:10.380> the<00:04:10.440> letter<00:04:10.830> interacts<00:04:11.459> with<00:04:11.730> the

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
how the letter interacts with the

how the letter interacts with the
character<00:04:12.270> you<00:04:12.450> don't<00:04:12.480> want<00:04:13.050> the<00:04:13.230> letter<00:04:13.440> to

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
awkward way and this was a great example

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.760 
awkward way and this was a great example
of<00:04:17.670> how<00:04:17.730> a<00:04:18.209> character<00:04:18.690> and<00:04:18.840> a<00:04:18.870> letter<00:04:19.109> interact
