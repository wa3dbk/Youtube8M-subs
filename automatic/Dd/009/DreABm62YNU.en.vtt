00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
in this GoPro tips and tricks video

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.900 
in this GoPro tips and tricks video
we're<00:00:02.550> making<00:00:02.580> a<00:00:02.970> DIY<00:00:03.740> floating<00:00:04.740> tripod<00:00:05.549> for

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
we're making a DIY floating tripod for

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.010 
we're making a DIY floating tripod for
our<00:00:06.029> GoPro<00:00:06.450> camera

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
our GoPro camera

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.720 
our GoPro camera
so<00:00:07.200> this<00:00:07.350> tripods<00:00:07.830> can<00:00:07.980> allow<00:00:08.160> us<00:00:08.309> to<00:00:08.460> float

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
so this tripods can allow us to float

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.580 
so this tripods can allow us to float
our<00:00:08.849> camera<00:00:09.179> on<00:00:09.330> top<00:00:09.690> of<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:10.019> water<00:00:10.200> and<00:00:10.290> get

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
our camera on top of the water and get

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.669 
our camera on top of the water and get
stable<00:00:11.040> shots<00:00:11.280> of<00:00:11.840> someone<00:00:12.840> coming<00:00:13.290> towards

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
stable shots of someone coming towards

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.110 
stable shots of someone coming towards
the<00:00:13.799> camera<00:00:14.130> going<00:00:14.309> away<00:00:14.490> from<00:00:14.549> it<00:00:14.820> this<00:00:14.940> could

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
the camera going away from it this could

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.210 
the camera going away from it this could
be<00:00:15.240> useful<00:00:15.389> if<00:00:15.660> you<00:00:15.750> wanted<00:00:15.990> to<00:00:16.199> place<00:00:17.010> this

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
be useful if you wanted to place this

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.950 
be useful if you wanted to place this
camera<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.670> water<00:00:17.880> and<00:00:18.180> have<00:00:18.300> someone<00:00:18.660> say

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
camera the water and have someone say

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.740 
camera the water and have someone say
wakeboard<00:00:19.590> kayak<00:00:20.250> paddle<00:00:20.880> board<00:00:21.090> towards<00:00:21.300> it

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
wakeboard kayak paddle board towards it

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.050 
wakeboard kayak paddle board towards it
and<00:00:22.260> it<00:00:22.350> would<00:00:22.470> get<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.619> really<00:00:22.890> cool<00:00:23.220> shot<00:00:23.820> of

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
and it would get a really cool shot of

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.120 
and it would get a really cool shot of
them<00:00:24.600> coming<00:00:24.630> towards<00:00:25.380> it<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:25.650> then<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:26.010> can

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
them coming towards it and then it can

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.490 
them coming towards it and then it can
also<00:00:26.369> be<00:00:26.760> flipped<00:00:27.060> over<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:28.080> camera<00:00:28.380> can

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
also be flipped over and the camera can

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.410 
also be flipped over and the camera can
hang<00:00:28.769> underwater<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:29.880> you<00:00:29.939> can<00:00:30.060> use<00:00:30.210> it<00:00:30.240> to

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
hang underwater and you can use it to

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.269 
hang underwater and you can use it to
capture<00:00:30.630> pictures<00:00:31.109> of<00:00:31.260> people<00:00:31.500> snorkeling<00:00:32.040> or

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
capture pictures of people snorkeling or

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.200 
capture pictures of people snorkeling or
just<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.120> goings<00:00:33.480> on<00:00:33.630> underwater<00:00:34.380> from<00:00:34.800> a

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 
just the goings on underwater from a

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.610 
just the goings on underwater from a
fixed<00:00:36.210> position<00:00:36.690> now<00:00:37.170> if<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:37.380> wanted<00:00:37.559> to

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
fixed position now if you wanted to

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.049 
fixed position now if you wanted to
anchor<00:00:38.010> this<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.340> could<00:00:38.520> do<00:00:38.640> that<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:39.030> could

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
anchor this you could do that you could

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.700 
anchor this you could do that you could
anchor<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.629> tie<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:39.840> string<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.200> one<00:00:40.410> side<00:00:40.620> of

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
anchor and tie a string to one side of

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.490 
anchor and tie a string to one side of
it<00:00:40.800> but<00:00:41.040> it<00:00:41.579> could<00:00:41.730> also<00:00:41.850> work<00:00:42.090> just

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
it but it could also work just

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:49.010 
it but it could also work just
