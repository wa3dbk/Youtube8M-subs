hi I'm Jack I like to talk to you a
little<00:00:10.650> bit<00:00:10.860> about<00:00:10.980> V<00:00:11.340> Sophie<00:00:11.730> oh<00:00:11.759> this<00:00:12.179> time

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
little bit about V Sophie oh this time

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.270 
little bit about V Sophie oh this time
of<00:00:12.599> year<00:00:12.780> it's<00:00:13.170> pretty<00:00:13.469> important<00:00:13.980> that<00:00:14.130> we

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
of year it's pretty important that we

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.510 
of year it's pretty important that we
all<00:00:14.460> winterize<00:00:15.420> our<00:00:15.690> fuel<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.830> reason<00:00:17.460> we

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
all winterize our fuel the reason we

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.060 
all winterize our fuel the reason we
need<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:17.789> winterize<00:00:18.060> it<00:00:18.449> is<00:00:18.720> because<00:00:19.080> about<00:00:19.410> 32

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
need to winterize it is because about 32

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.460 
need to winterize it is because about 32
degrees<00:00:20.480> diesel<00:00:21.480> fuel<00:00:21.689> will<00:00:21.779> start<00:00:22.020> clouding

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
degrees diesel fuel will start clouding

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.500 
degrees diesel fuel will start clouding
up<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:23.400> that's<00:00:23.550> not<00:00:23.699> really<00:00:23.939> because<00:00:24.150> of<00:00:24.359> the

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
up and that's not really because of the

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.500 
up and that's not really because of the
water<00:00:24.750> that's<00:00:25.050> in<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.320> diesel<00:00:25.650> fuel<00:00:26.510> because

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
water that's in the diesel fuel because

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.700 
water that's in the diesel fuel because
the<00:00:27.689> filters<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.109> everything's<00:00:28.439> supposed<00:00:28.560> to

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
the filters and everything's supposed to

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.859 
the filters and everything's supposed to
take<00:00:28.859> that<00:00:29.010> out<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.699> buy<00:00:29.910> clean<00:00:30.359> fuel<00:00:30.750> we'll

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
take that out and buy clean fuel we'll

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.080 
take that out and buy clean fuel we'll
keep<00:00:31.050> it<00:00:31.230> clean<00:00:31.470> but<00:00:32.189> it's<00:00:32.669> more<00:00:32.820> for<00:00:32.969> the

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
keep it clean but it's more for the

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.970 
keep it clean but it's more for the
paraffin<00:00:33.480> wax<00:00:33.750> that's<00:00:34.079> in<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.380> fuel<00:00:34.590> though

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
paraffin wax that's in the fuel though

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.030 
paraffin wax that's in the fuel though
the<00:00:35.250> wax<00:00:35.489> starts<00:00:35.910> clouding<00:00:36.329> up<00:00:36.480> and

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
the wax starts clouding up and

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.700 
the wax starts clouding up and
crystallizing<00:00:38.040> about<00:00:38.850> 32<00:00:39.480> degrees<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.379> then

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
crystallizing about 32 degrees and then

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.340 
crystallizing about 32 degrees and then
about<00:00:41.010> 15<00:00:41.250> degrees<00:00:41.640> lower<00:00:42.450> than<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:42.989> get

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
about 15 degrees lower than that and get

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.340 
about 15 degrees lower than that and get
about<00:00:43.500> 17<00:00:44.100> 15<00:00:44.640> degrees<00:00:45.030> it'll<00:00:45.750> actually<00:00:45.930> start

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
about 17 15 degrees it'll actually start

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.020 
about 17 15 degrees it'll actually start
clogging<00:00:46.739> up<00:00:46.860> your<00:00:46.890> filters<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.399> gelling<00:00:47.879> up

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
clogging up your filters and gelling up

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.090 
clogging up your filters and gelling up
and<00:00:48.210> getting<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.480> so<00:00:48.660> solid<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.829> point

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
and getting it so solid to the point

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.709 
and getting it so solid to the point
that<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.399> not<00:00:50.789> only<00:00:50.820> doesn't<00:00:51.360> go<00:00:51.449> through<00:00:51.629> the

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
that it not only doesn't go through the

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.180 
that it not only doesn't go through the
filter<00:00:52.020> but<00:00:52.199> it'll<00:00:52.410> get<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.710> where<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:52.920> can't

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
filter but it'll get to where you can't

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.610 
filter but it'll get to where you can't
even<00:00:53.340> pour<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.910> if<00:00:54.719> you've<00:00:54.930> ever<00:00:55.110> seen<00:00:55.350> some

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
even pour it if you've ever seen some

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.040 
even pour it if you've ever seen some
really<00:00:55.829> gel<00:00:56.160> fuel<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:56.820> it's<00:00:57.390> pretty<00:00:57.629> nasty

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
really gel fuel it it's pretty nasty

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.810 
really gel fuel it it's pretty nasty
stuff<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.530> best<00:00:58.739> thing<00:00:58.920> you<00:00:59.039> can<00:00:59.219> do<00:00:59.399> for<00:00:59.670> that

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
stuff the best thing you can do for that

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.889 
stuff the best thing you can do for that
is<00:01:00.120> to<00:01:00.600> use<00:01:00.809> some<00:01:01.609> fuel<00:01:02.609> additives<00:01:03.120> there<00:01:03.840> are

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
is to use some fuel additives there are

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.140 
is to use some fuel additives there are
several<00:01:04.110> different<00:01:04.589> ones<00:01:04.739> and<00:01:05.189> just<00:01:05.519> just

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
several different ones and just just

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.539 
several different ones and just just
make<00:01:06.299> sure<00:01:06.479> that<00:01:06.510> you're<00:01:06.900> using<00:01:07.140> one<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:08.040> and

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
make sure that you're using one that and

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.090 
make sure that you're using one that and
use<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:09.510> according<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.320> manufacturers

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
use it according to the manufacturers

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.830 
use it according to the manufacturers
recommendations<00:01:11.479> they'll<00:01:12.479> all<00:01:12.689> have

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
recommendations they'll all have

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.510 
recommendations they'll all have
instructions<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.979> don't<00:01:14.159> want<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.369> really

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
instructions you don't want to really

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.300 
instructions you don't want to really
over<00:01:14.909> treat<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.720> neither<00:01:15.930> because<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:17.070> start

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
over treat it neither because you start

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.330 
over treat it neither because you start
over<00:01:17.580> treating<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.330> gets<00:01:18.450> into<00:01:18.720> your

difference<00:02:08.950> in<00:02:09.070> price<00:02:09.340> however<00:02:09.790> so<00:02:10.030> it's<00:02:10.180> more

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
difference in price however so it's more

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.360 
difference in price however so it's more
cost<00:02:10.570> effective<00:02:11.080> to<00:02:11.110> use<00:02:11.260> additive<00:02:11.890> then<00:02:12.160> to

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
cost effective to use additive then to

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.760 
cost effective to use additive then to
try<00:02:12.610> to<00:02:12.670> find<00:02:12.940> that<00:02:13.180> number<00:02:13.750> one<00:02:13.900> fuel<00:02:14.200> which

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
try to find that number one fuel which

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.520 
try to find that number one fuel which
isn't<00:02:15.130> readily<00:02:15.460> available<00:02:15.670> everywhere<00:02:16.330> so<00:02:17.170> if

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
isn't readily available everywhere so if

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.110 
isn't readily available everywhere so if
you're<00:02:17.740> in<00:02:17.860> a<00:02:17.950> cooler<00:02:18.220> climate<00:02:18.550> and<00:02:18.940> the

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
you're in a cooler climate and the

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.220 
you're in a cooler climate and the
temperature<00:02:19.480> is<00:02:19.540> going<00:02:19.690> to<00:02:19.780> drop<00:02:19.840> below

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
temperature is going to drop below

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.500 
temperature is going to drop below
freezing<00:02:20.500> I<00:02:21.010> need<00:02:21.880> to<00:02:21.940> think<00:02:22.030> about<00:02:22.300> adding

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
freezing I need to think about adding

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.690 
freezing I need to think about adding
some<00:02:22.930> additive<00:02:23.290> to<00:02:23.410> your<00:02:23.560> fuel<00:02:23.770> definitely<00:02:24.580> be

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
some additive to your fuel definitely be

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.449 
some additive to your fuel definitely be
a<00:02:24.730> good<00:02:24.970> idea<00:02:25.300> to<00:02:25.600> keep<00:02:25.900> a<00:02:26.080> bottle<00:02:26.400> in<00:02:27.400> your

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
a good idea to keep a bottle in your

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.120 
a good idea to keep a bottle in your
truck<00:02:28.330> so<00:02:28.660> you'll<00:02:28.900> have<00:02:29.080> it<00:02:29.260> just<00:02:29.440> in<00:02:29.530> case<00:02:29.740> you

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
truck so you'll have it just in case you

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.500 
truck so you'll have it just in case you
know<00:02:30.190> you<00:02:30.220> may<00:02:30.400> stop<00:02:30.670> somewhere<00:02:31.090> for<00:02:31.270> fuel

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
know you may stop somewhere for fuel

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.420 
know you may stop somewhere for fuel
that<00:02:31.630> doesn't<00:02:32.170> have<00:02:32.320> it<00:02:32.440> or<00:02:32.560> they<00:02:32.680> ran<00:02:32.860> out<00:02:33.100> so

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
that doesn't have it or they ran out so

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.750 
that doesn't have it or they ran out so
the<00:02:33.970> F<00:02:34.150> tanks<00:02:34.600> they'll<00:02:34.750> have<00:02:35.340> tears<00:02:36.340> on<00:02:36.610> them

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
the F tanks they'll have tears on them

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.220 
the F tanks they'll have tears on them
then<00:02:37.030> you<00:02:37.300> don't<00:02:37.450> want<00:02:37.600> to<00:02:37.660> know<00:02:37.720> dirt<00:02:37.959> and

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
then you don't want to know dirt and

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.110 
then you don't want to know dirt and
stuff<00:02:38.410> getting<00:02:38.680> in<00:02:38.830> there<00:02:39.070> so<00:02:39.520> wipe<00:02:39.880> off

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
stuff getting in there so wipe off

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.780 
stuff getting in there so wipe off
around<00:02:40.720> your<00:02:41.080> top<00:02:41.410> before<00:02:41.830> you<00:02:41.890> open<00:02:42.280> that<00:02:42.430> and

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
around your top before you open that and

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.250 
around your top before you open that and
make<00:02:43.240> sure<00:02:43.270> it's<00:02:43.540> really<00:02:43.690> clean<00:02:43.990> because

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
make sure it's really clean because

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.400 
make sure it's really clean because
that's<00:02:44.470> a<00:02:44.920> real<00:02:45.100> big<00:02:45.280> things<00:02:45.520> keeping<00:02:46.090> the<00:02:46.410> DF

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
that's a real big things keeping the DF

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.840 
that's a real big things keeping the DF
fluid<00:02:47.770> clean

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.910
