 negligence as we say and that responsibilities are refined 

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:26.069
 I believe that because it is that in hours in the money rather than retracing a life 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:32.020
 I believe that the hospital is your business so clear speaks Fatima

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.050
 painful trance of losing a child with 18 months 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.330

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.940
 babies

 each case is different 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.780
 but they have something in common 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.410
 the mistake and its diagnoses and the refusal to perform the tests 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.450
 asked by relatives 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.910
 their ordeal has led them to join and since then they have collected signatures 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.500

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:10.420

 I could only tolerate oral 

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:51.090
 as indicated by the cardiologist who attended the little one of a disease 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.100
 congenital in the heart 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.220
 the apart to zero house comma the poorest to the first 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.160
 which we do a little 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.040
 the al revealed how he behaves as not 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.880
 and it was because the girl was not well that she was not good enough to say 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.790
 something normal and to say the one 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.449
 that the girl had to be in the uci 

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:13.409
 and she told me that what she produces was that she was transferred to valencia, something that 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:16.389
 Negaba Kerala Great move to Valencia 

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:20.239
 that will not put him in the uci and a few hours later he died then you 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:21.419
 questions the why 

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:24.839
 for up to four days the different ticos treated the little one 

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:25.380
 ruben 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.960
 pneumonia meningitis 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.700
 by not improving and after insisting a lot of fatima got the transfer to 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.370
 Alicante hospital where the first test they did revealed what in 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.829
 actually suffered from encephalitis 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:39.119
 too late 

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:41.769
 his son died a few days later 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:43.219
 my son 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:46.269
 in the month meaning dying 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:50.809
 who could have been saved, I dedicate what she attributed to the hospital 

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:54.259
 that is a 4 80 and in this context then 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:58.319
 in that it had nothing to do with what I had 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:03.189
 in January do the tests ana belén does not leave the photo of rubén binari 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:08.029
 her baby died in November 2006 for an alleged initial misdiagnosis of 

00:03:08.029 --> 00:03:10.089
 the meningitis that suffered 

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:13.729
 was the first of the cases reported in the public hospital although 

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:15.129
 private management 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:18.129
 efe goes away I wonder those I feel 

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:22.199
 the emergency department would have done simple blood tests 

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:27.079
 oliver have ceased to be a nation until the pediatricians arrived 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:29.319
 I think that could have saved 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:31.059
 because they did not do anything to him 

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:33.430
 their cases are in the hands of justice 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.560
 They hope that the administrations that have hitherto contacted us 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.890
 with them or to give them their condolences 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.969
 react with the thousands of signatures delivered today 

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:46.199
 The alleged negligence ensures that they continue to occur in the hospital 

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:47.479
 torrevejense 

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:53.589
 fasting mom who in 2007 had a human abortion join a premature delivery of 

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:54.839
 six months 

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:56.930
 and she would let the girl die 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:00.279
 they left her until the girl died in the crypt 

00:04:00.279 --> 00:04:01.529
 here too 

00:04:01.529 --> 00:04:04.209
 in the denunciation of that unit we 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:08.529
 we tried several more cases that have joined us because as they have been 

00:04:08.529 --> 00:04:10.039
 left a bad child 

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:14.029
 as for example the girl of 20 and a trip left her with more paralysis 

00:04:14.029 --> 00:04:15.579
 cerebral 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:20.370
 I recently learned what the other girl who died after 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.749
 of our 

00:04:21.749 --> 00:04:25.469
 So, more and more complaints are coming from CBS. People are joining 

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:29.620
 we announce that they will not stop until they get justice done with 

00:04:29.619 --> 00:04:30.499
 their children 

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:33.909
 they will continue to collect signatures and they will concentrate as they did 

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:34.650
 months 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.580
 they do not want money they insist only they ask for the disqualification of the professionals 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.180
 who cared for their little ones 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.620
 and those who have denounced for not avoiding their deaths
