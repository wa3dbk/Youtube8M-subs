00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
hope I hope it's in the box I don't know

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.340 
hope I hope it's in the box I don't know
if<00:01:28.229> it<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.470> but<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:28.770> hope<00:01:28.860> is<00:01:29.070> it's<00:01:29.640> got<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:30.350> two

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
if it is but I hope is it's got to two

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.960 
if it is but I hope is it's got to two
cables<00:01:31.740> it's<00:01:31.920> got<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.100> shorter<00:01:32.520> cable<00:01:32.670> that

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
cables it's got a shorter cable that

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.060 
cables it's got a shorter cable that
plugs<00:01:33.060> into<00:01:33.500> one<00:01:34.500> side<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.890> headphones

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
plugs into one side of the headphones

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.539 
plugs into one side of the headphones
and<00:01:35.579> then<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:36.390> think<00:01:36.960> like<00:01:37.049> an<00:01:37.259> 11<00:01:37.650> foot<00:01:37.680> cable

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
and then I think like an 11 foot cable

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.819 
and then I think like an 11 foot cable
which<00:01:39.180> is<00:01:39.299> ideal<00:01:39.570> for<00:01:39.810> me<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:40.290> when<00:01:40.500> I<00:01:40.590> plug

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
which is ideal for me so when I plug

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.170 
which is ideal for me so when I plug
these<00:01:41.009> headphones<00:01:41.189> into<00:01:41.520> my<00:01:41.670> stereo<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:42.030> can

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
these headphones into my stereo I can

see<00:03:45.950> if<00:03:45.980> it<00:03:46.130> tells<00:03:46.340> me<00:03:46.459> what<00:03:46.640> the<00:03:46.940> contents<00:03:47.450> are

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
see if it tells me what the contents are

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.830 
see if it tells me what the contents are
in<00:03:47.630> here<00:03:47.840> but<00:03:48.100> it<00:03:49.100> doesn't<00:03:49.250> really<00:03:49.459> say<00:03:49.840> but

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
in here but it doesn't really say but

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.680 
in here but it doesn't really say but
i'm<00:03:50.989> gonna<00:03:51.110> slide<00:03:51.350> that<00:03:51.530> to<00:03:51.680> the<00:03:51.769> side<00:03:52.630> but<00:03:53.630> I

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
i'm gonna slide that to the side but I

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.720 
i'm gonna slide that to the side but I
bought<00:03:53.900> this<00:03:54.019> primarily<00:03:54.500> for<00:03:54.830> the<00:03:56.110> for<00:03:57.110> the<00:03:57.730> 11

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
bought this primarily for the for the 11

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.410 
bought this primarily for the for the 11
foot<00:03:58.910> cable<00:03:59.840> it's<00:04:00.680> very<00:04:01.070> thick<00:04:01.430> very<00:04:01.880> durable

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
foot cable it's very thick very durable

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.860 
foot cable it's very thick very durable
in<00:04:03.080> fact<00:04:03.260> I'll<00:04:03.440> go<00:04:03.560> ahead<00:04:03.680> and<00:04:03.920> open<00:04:04.630> it<00:04:05.630> up<00:04:05.690> and

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
in fact I'll go ahead and open it up and

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.620 
in fact I'll go ahead and open it up and
give<00:04:05.959> you<00:04:06.049> an<00:04:06.140> idea<00:04:06.200> of<00:04:06.500> how<00:04:07.299> really<00:04:08.299> long<00:04:08.480> it

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
give you an idea of how really long it

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.949 
give you an idea of how really long it
is<00:04:08.720> I<00:04:08.750> mean<00:04:09.019> this<00:04:09.110> thing<00:04:09.380> is<00:04:10.690> just<00:04:11.690> like<00:04:11.840> it's

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
is I mean this thing is just like it's

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:16.759 
is I mean this thing is just like it's
long<00:04:12.170> you<00:04:12.799> can<00:04:12.980> see

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:22.500 

34<00:04:17.769> I<00:04:18.810> mean<00:04:20.220> it's<00:04:21.220> definitely<00:04:21.459> 11<00:04:22.090> feet<00:04:22.300> at

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
34 I mean it's definitely 11 feet at

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.240 
34 I mean it's definitely 11 feet at
least<00:04:22.570> 11<00:04:23.110> feet

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
least 11 feet

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.850 
least 11 feet
I<00:04:24.570> guess<00:04:25.570> press<00:04:25.810> the<00:04:25.960> cable<00:04:26.260> in<00:04:26.350> the<00:04:26.380> box<00:04:26.560> over

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
I guess press the cable in the box over

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.129 
I guess press the cable in the box over
here<00:04:26.950> let<00:04:27.250> me<00:04:27.280> grab<00:04:27.520> it<00:04:27.550> it<00:04:28.510> comes<00:04:28.720> with<00:04:28.900> a<00:04:28.960> much

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
here let me grab it it comes with a much

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:31.440 
here let me grab it it comes with a much
thinner<00:04:29.830> cable<00:04:30.310> which<00:04:30.550> compared<00:04:30.940> to<00:04:31.030> this<00:04:31.180> is

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
thinner cable which compared to this is

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.379 
thinner cable which compared to this is
night<00:04:31.900> and<00:04:31.930> day<00:04:32.169> but<00:04:32.950> you<00:04:33.070> get<00:04:33.250> a<00:04:33.300> leave<00:04:34.300> this

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389 
night and day but you get a leave this

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:40.320 
night and day but you get a leave this
off<00:04:34.600> to<00:04:34.750> the<00:04:34.780> side<00:04:38.310> you<00:04:39.310> get<00:04:39.460> a<00:04:39.490> lot<00:04:40.120> thinner

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
off to the side you get a lot thinner

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:41.760 
off to the side you get a lot thinner
cable<00:04:40.720> now<00:04:40.840> this<00:04:40.990> thing<00:04:41.169> in<00:04:41.320> terms<00:04:41.560> of

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
cable now this thing in terms of

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.640 
cable now this thing in terms of
thickness<00:04:42.870> there's<00:04:43.870> a<00:04:43.960> crazy<00:04:44.260> amount<00:04:44.530> of

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
thickness there's a crazy amount of

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.760 
thickness there's a crazy amount of
difference<00:04:44.980> between<00:04:45.250> these<00:04:45.370> two<00:04:45.550> cables<00:04:46.770> look

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
difference between these two cables look

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:53.420 
difference between these two cables look
at<00:04:47.919> the<00:04:48.010> difference<00:04:50.610> it's<00:04:51.610> quite<00:04:52.330> significant

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
at the difference it's quite significant

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.280 
at the difference it's quite significant
in<00:04:54.430> terms<00:04:54.490> of<00:04:54.790> the<00:04:54.850> thickness<00:04:55.270> so<00:04:55.510> I<00:04:55.750> think

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:56.290 
in terms of the thickness so I think

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.050 
in terms of the thickness so I think
durability<00:04:57.190> wise<00:04:57.340> this<00:04:57.520> one's<00:04:57.730> gonna<00:04:57.850> last

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
durability wise this one's gonna last

00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.159 
durability wise this one's gonna last
you<00:04:58.210> but<00:04:58.330> you<00:04:58.540> know<00:04:58.630> who's<00:04:58.780> gonna<00:04:58.900> walk<00:04:59.050> around

00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.169 
you but you know who's gonna walk around

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:00.659 
you but you know who's gonna walk around
with<00:04:59.350> an<00:04:59.530> 11<00:04:59.860> foot<00:04:59.890> cable<00:05:00.280> attached

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
with an 11 foot cable attached

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:02.310 
with an 11 foot cable attached
themselves<00:05:00.940> this<00:05:01.570> one<00:05:01.780> here<00:05:01.930> is<00:05:02.020> more<00:05:02.169> like<00:05:02.200> a

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
themselves this one here is more like a

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.580 
themselves this one here is more like a
6-footer<00:05:02.919> something<00:05:03.880> you<00:05:04.000> listen<00:05:04.300> to<00:05:04.590> you

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
6-footer something you listen to you

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:08.100 
6-footer something you listen to you
know<00:05:05.710> walk<00:05:06.130> around<00:05:06.400> with<00:05:06.490> your<00:05:06.720> your<00:05:07.720> iPod<00:05:08.080> or
