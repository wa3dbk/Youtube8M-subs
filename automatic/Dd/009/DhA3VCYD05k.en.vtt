00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.930 
random so I guess we could just go ahead
and<00:00:52.350> try<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:52.770> start<00:00:53.070> this<00:00:53.250> match<00:00:53.430> now<00:00:53.670> I'm

of<00:01:07.020> scarf<00:01:07.470> why's<00:01:07.680> it<00:01:07.860> in<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.130> dream<00:01:08.340> ball<00:01:08.549> I

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
of scarf why's it in a dream ball I

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.760 
of scarf why's it in a dream ball I
don't<00:01:08.850> even<00:01:08.970> know<00:01:09.210> but<00:01:09.540> uh<00:01:09.570> it's<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.380> scarf

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770

modest<00:01:11.490> of<00:01:11.790> you<00:01:11.820> know<00:01:12.330> water<00:01:12.689> spouting<00:01:13.350> sorts

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
modest of you know water spouting sorts

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.980 
modest of you know water spouting sorts
but<00:01:14.250> I<00:01:14.310> figured<00:01:14.580> Shadow<00:01:14.850> Ball<00:01:15.090> would<00:01:15.390> probably

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
but I figured Shadow Ball would probably

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.660 
but I figured Shadow Ball would probably
take<00:01:16.200> out<00:01:16.380> being<00:01:16.650> stabbed<00:01:17.009> super<00:01:17.400> effective

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
take out being stabbed super effective

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.170 
take out being stabbed super effective
modest<00:01:18.210> but<00:01:19.189> slowbro<00:01:20.189> special<00:01:20.610> defense<00:01:20.880> you

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
modest but slowbro special defense you

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.609 
modest but slowbro special defense you
know<00:01:21.330> art<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:21.570> thought<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:21.900> wasn't<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.350> great

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
know art I thought it wasn't that great

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.200 
know art I thought it wasn't that great
but<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:23.009> know<00:01:23.130> he's<00:01:23.280> able<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.670> live<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:24.030> knew

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
but you know he's able to live I knew

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.850 
but you know he's able to live I knew
that<00:01:24.240> like<00:01:24.630> slow<00:01:24.960> Kings<00:01:25.229> more<00:01:25.439> special

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
that like slow Kings more special

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.100 
that like slow Kings more special
defensive<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.580> slow<00:01:27.270> Bros<00:01:27.479> more<00:01:27.659> physical

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
defensive and slow Bros more physical

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.600 
defensive and slow Bros more physical
defensive<00:01:28.530> but<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.680> figured<00:01:28.979> he'd<00:01:29.100> slack<00:01:29.369> off

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
defensive but I figured he'd slack off

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.090 
defensive but I figured he'd slack off
or<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.600> know<00:01:30.720> switch<00:01:31.020> out<00:01:31.200> go<00:01:31.409> for<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.740> me

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
or you know switch out go for the me

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.890 
or you know switch out go for the me
know<00:01:32.280> regeneration<00:01:33.000> or<00:01:33.390> something<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:33.840> don't

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
know regeneration or something I don't

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.510 
know regeneration or something I don't
know<00:01:34.079> so<00:01:34.259> I<00:01:34.290> figured<00:01:34.590> I'd<00:01:34.680> bring<00:01:34.829> in<00:01:35.009> send<00:01:35.369> your

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.960 
I figured whatever i do have shadow
sneak<00:02:19.200> but<00:02:20.200> uh<00:02:20.230> I<00:02:20.530> know<00:02:20.650> like<00:02:21.099> seeing<00:02:21.459> like<00:02:21.550> his

sneak but uh I know like seeing like his

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.880 
sneak but uh I know like seeing like his
moobs<00:02:22.239> he<00:02:22.510> probably<00:02:22.780> doesn't<00:02:23.230> have<00:02:23.319> anything

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
moobs he probably doesn't have anything

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.440 
moobs he probably doesn't have anything
to<00:02:24.069> really<00:02:24.250> hit<00:02:24.489> me<00:02:24.550> with<00:02:24.879> since<00:02:25.300> he<00:02:25.360> has

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
to really hit me with since he has

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.059 
to really hit me with since he has
thunder<00:02:25.720> wave<00:02:25.840> slack<00:02:26.140> off<00:02:26.349> glad<00:02:26.709> he<00:02:26.830> probably

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
thunder wave slack off glad he probably

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.339 
thunder wave slack off glad he probably
has<00:02:27.310> psychic<00:02:27.730> force<00:02:27.940> tab<00:02:28.150> so<00:02:28.480> I<00:02:28.660> figured<00:02:29.230> I

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
has psychic force tab so I figured I

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:30.900 
has psychic force tab so I figured I
just<00:02:29.590> go<00:02:29.709> for<00:02:29.890> an<00:02:29.980> X<00:02:30.099> Izzard<00:02:30.340> do<00:02:30.640> as<00:02:30.760> much

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
just go for an X Izzard do as much

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:32.190 
just go for an X Izzard do as much
damage<00:02:30.940> as<00:02:31.300> I<00:02:31.420> can<00:02:31.630> said<00:02:31.780> he<00:02:31.900> can't<00:02:32.080> do

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200

damage as I can said he can't do
anything<00:02:32.230> I<00:02:32.680> think<00:02:33.069> it<00:02:33.130> brings<00:02:33.250> in<00:02:33.430> Pidgey

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
tah and just go for a low kick I thought

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.890 
tah and just go for a low kick I thought
it<00:04:06.459> would<00:04:06.819> do<00:04:07.000> more<00:04:07.209> cuz<00:04:07.510> I<00:04:07.599> thought<00:04:07.630> what

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
it would do more cuz I thought what

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.140 
it would do more cuz I thought what
Dino's<00:04:08.200> were<00:04:08.410> decently<00:04:09.340> heavy<00:04:09.639> but

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
Dino's were decently heavy but

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.030 
Dino's were decently heavy but
apparently<00:04:11.019> doesn't<00:04:11.230> do<00:04:11.349> that<00:04:11.470> much<00:04:11.530> oil<00:04:11.709> does

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
apparently doesn't do that much oil does

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.949 
apparently doesn't do that much oil does
a<00:04:12.639> ton<00:04:12.849> because<00:04:13.060> of<00:04:13.239> a<00:04:13.299> crit<00:04:13.569> but<00:04:13.930> I

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
a ton because of a crit but I

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:15.659 
a ton because of a crit but I
didn't<00:04:14.560> really<00:04:14.590> do<00:04:15.010> as<00:04:15.099> much<00:04:15.220> as<00:04:15.280> I<00:04:15.430> thought

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:15.669 
didn't really do as much as I thought

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:18.690 
didn't really do as much as I thought
and<00:04:15.970> um<00:04:16.239> I<00:04:16.590> figured<00:04:17.590> since<00:04:17.829> he<00:04:18.099> is<00:04:18.190> under<00:04:18.459> half

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:18.700 
and um I figured since he is under half

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.099 
and um I figured since he is under half
and<00:04:18.970> might<00:04:19.090> as<00:04:19.150> well<00:04:19.239> just<00:04:19.329> go<00:04:19.479> for<00:04:19.750> flare

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
and might as well just go for flare

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:21.719 
and might as well just go for flare
blitz<00:04:20.349> since<00:04:20.620> it<00:04:20.739> is<00:04:20.859> stabbed<00:04:21.220> and<00:04:21.549> I<00:04:21.579> will

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
blitz since it is stabbed and I will

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:23.730 
blitz since it is stabbed and I will
probably<00:04:22.060> die<00:04:22.240> to<00:04:22.300> another<00:04:22.930> to<00:04:23.710> another

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
probably die to another to another

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.260 
probably die to another to another
return

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
return

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:26.909 
return
I will<00:04:25.690> die<00:04:25.900> to<00:04:25.960> another<00:04:26.259> return<00:04:26.560> so<00:04:26.710> i<00:04:26.740> must

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
I will die to another return so i must

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:28.920 
I will die to another return so i must
go<00:04:27.220> for<00:04:27.430> Flair<00:04:27.669> but<00:04:27.789> gives<00:04:28.120> much<00:04:28.330> damage<00:04:28.720> and

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
go for Flair but gives much damage and

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.200 
go for Flair but gives much damage and
