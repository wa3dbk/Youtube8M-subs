 People I have no idea so I 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.729
 Unfortunately God does not know I'm there 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.350
 a few ideas maybe 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.570

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.219
 i am looking for a mature medicine because 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.219

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.350
 teams a girlfriend from my

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.719
 by exclusion procedure directly 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.790
 taken and is now a really good one 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.469
 Doctors just notice that's what 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.149
 for her, that I am once again notes 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.590
 Not everything in life had to be done with heart

 there 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.790
 so look at me in the matter 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.739
 heart and you will enjoy it 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.950
 then he also does his thing automatically 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:22.010
 Well , that's just how it looks 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:25.250
 Now first nice youtube-channel fun 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:28.420
 have free has all this possible whole 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.530
 Just start up really nice 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.830
 but now two more memories 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.330
 first of all, I would forget that 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.519
 like to carry on bidder street again 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.879
 that means you send me the best 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:45.410
 Just be your best streep this time 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:49.010
 again I do not have my own street 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:51.709
 I just want your better one 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.780
 tricks everything over five kills me 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.860
 send and then we'll see if 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.840
 I take out the best 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.129
 they do and then you one again 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.110
 own street job I have unfortunately 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:01.670
 not the time had so many now 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.430
 you miss a good street 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.590
 rausgerissen recorded that is 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.959
 You just send me your best aek 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.910
 street to a google document that itself 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.650
 have linked below in the description 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.299
 because just enter your data 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.920
 everything in there that is 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:17.690
 explain everything yourself and then it runs 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.040
 I also like to hare from you 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.420
 ask again to a completely 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.980
 Battlefield and my channel 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.600
 since the next day on sunday 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.280
 I can answer that question 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.200
 on the last sunday already get the 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.069
 I will be different next time 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.730
 answer week 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:34.579
 but now too profitable I became 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.599
 extremely often asked what would both of them have 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:37.700
 sorry, it is still for you 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:39.380
 real battlefield is totally 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.209
 shit that's new again 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:44.269
 comes out easily yes it is totally shit 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.709
 but it is a battlefield and no me 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.510
 I still do not want to judge 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.340
 I just want to say so much this whole 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.099
 keeps the internet that circulated 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.609
 bayfield heart like that if i was that 

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:57.680
 is shit that is found at his 

00:03:54.609 --> 00:04:01.370
 will be perfect nee people is waiting 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.590
 times from asking 44 was not good and is 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.209
 it also still mean it 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.800
 it's a decent one 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:08.200
 but unfortunately not a good game 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.720
 I could gamble for hours without the 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.129
 to lose fun where i just easy 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.910
 no growth are still the one 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:14.349
 growth 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.720
 even if you are out then that is 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:18.250
 Gameplay design still the balance 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.440
 still can not stop it perfectly 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.050
 many factors that is the webdesign that 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.570
 be the vehicle to vehicle balancing 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.889
 that a general thing in the 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.930
 connection with laptop and leveldesign 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:31.780
 stand that is all so small things 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.340
 the game just blinds my eyes 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.229
 prevent it from being good and it 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.300
 easy to a mediocre school 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:38.620
 but still often make fun 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.690
 it is always such a dichotomy 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.040
 machnig and no matter some will not and 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:42.490
 Now, just have to look if he did 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.229
 on 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.790
 a similar motivation can provide 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:46.330
 for me then battlefield 3 or bad 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.100
 company 2 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:49.330
 The thing is now there where the people 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:55.630
 say more it is not 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:57.610
 battlefield and often the war 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:00.280
 between nations people battlefield 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:03.850
 defined by author fair means 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.760
 much to water in the land if 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:09.130
 you a dick there are no idea 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.660
 and who did leyen is a spin-off 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.370
 that means it is still one 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.260
 battlefield it still works 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.240
 like a battlefield only it is in one 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.039
 different topic with other modes though 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.599
 believe me it will be in many ways 

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:21.220
 still like a real battlefield 

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:22.840
 game it has a bunch of modes for 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.010
 example of this lattmann mode is a 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.680
 bit like capture the flag is the 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:27.820
 Hottest where you can only get over timetable 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.789
 must or must prevent depending on 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:35.860
 which side you play the the 

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:38.110
 host a bit like this one had to 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:41.020
 mode da ncs must save the hostages and 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:43.289
 so then just so car chase mode only then 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.289
 really 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:52.349
 I think I have no idea where to go 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.669
 chase has around each other 

00:05:52.349 --> 00:05:56.909
 only with vehicles and should 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:58.770
 it's pretty cool waiting 

00:05:56.909 --> 00:06:00.900
 first off as it is I am me 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:02.729
 not sure because it will be there together 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:04.530
 by the way, rascal games as far as I know 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:06.240
 after cusco games where the dead space 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:07.889
 marines singleplayer and there is the 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.580
 multiplayer part nothing bad 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:10.680
 deliver 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.810
 I'm still easy with one 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.069
 girlfriend expecting and the 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:15.900
 Season to really 

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:17.190
 and I just hope that's it 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.080
 I hope not too much now 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:21.180
 Battlefield 4 disappointed me and 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.879
 I think I should just leave 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:26.129
 we are on the e3 it will be and then 

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:29.310
 Let's look at the e3 I am 

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:33.120
 unfortunately not inland from 7 to 17 times 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:34.530
 on vacation and I will therefore give you two 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.870
 videos there but leave nothing 

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:39.289
 somehow with 1300 with something 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:42.000
 any news or whatever two 

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:45.419
 panda 2 3 comments and that without 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.159
 a video that means than I can 

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:50.550
 No three reports and also 

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:51.960
 no deadline must be up to date 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:55.830
 time to give that works unfortunately 

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:57.960
 god's not that that's as far as the 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:00.960
 Battlefield stops I have a little while ago 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:02.880
 briefly mentioned here reckon it will be 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:05.219

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.840

 I will still have the whole day at the 

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:14.039
 someone no longer tinkers 

00:07:12.539 --> 00:07:16.020
 my colleague says in which order 

00:07:14.039 --> 00:07:17.639
 that everything has to be done and that 

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:19.390
 that too until tomorrow monday then 

00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:21.810

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:24.280

 we'll see that I'm mine 

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:28.030
 even at the beginning I'm sure 

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.750
 is can of course also be a 

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:31.180
 move a bit 

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:33.040
