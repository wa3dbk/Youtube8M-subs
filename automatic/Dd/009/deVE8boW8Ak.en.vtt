00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 héloïse friends director entrusted us with a 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.440
 new software cgi list neo 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.710
 we will test it together we will start 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:14.429
 to open a death in virgin and we will 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:18.109
 do a simple sketch today on 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.109
 will choose the pencil tool 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.920
 the parameters are default 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.530
 the association is very close to a real 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.630
 pencil it is also possible to 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:29.220
 set the tools but to 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.940
 the moment we will use the software 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.790
 with the default settings 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:38.340
 CGI is a very lightweight software we did not 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.470
 no need for a powerful computer the 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.020
 basic tools settings are 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.910
 well done there is also good management 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.730
 layers we will not see that 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.120
 today because we only make one simple 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.129
 sketch 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.620
 we will see later for its cold the 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.030
 colo for this drawing I use a good 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.239
 old graphic tablet 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.230
 the bamboo pen is the cheapest of the 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.329
 market 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.070
 I hope with this realization that 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.739
 shows you that you can get a good 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.070
 result with an input palette of 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.020
 range 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.000
 of course if you have a tablet 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.220
 graphic a bit more expensive like the ink 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.410
 you soon as arctic the level of 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.020
 pressure is a little bit higher and the 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:19.140
 comfort and a little more top one goes 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.450
 save this little sketch and we'll 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.130
 also are kept an events file 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.350
 so that's a peculiarity of the 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.720
 software these young istres is that this 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.799
 event file allows you to replay 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.900
 the drawing that was saved very 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.090
 practice to make tutorials or 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.750
 show your friends 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.850
 how do you make your descendants there 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.010
 really saves all the gestures and 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:48.299
 it's really bluffing to see his 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:51.000
 drawing come true before our eyes we 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.799
 can slow down or speed it yet 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.229
 could see today the taking into 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.990
 hand is rather simple a simple calculation 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:00.600
 or little pencils and we realize our 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:03.390
 sketch we get sent next time 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.850
 for another achievement a little bit more 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.490
 complicated we will add them the color 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.700
 here we say ah very quickly ciao 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.700
 friends
