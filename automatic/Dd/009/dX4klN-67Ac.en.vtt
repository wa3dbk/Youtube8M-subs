to call it apple or CH and the next
thing<00:01:23.009> we're<00:01:23.189> going<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.340> do<00:01:23.580> is<00:01:23.850> let's<00:01:24.570> go

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
thing we're going to do is let's go

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.539 
thing we're going to do is let's go
ahead<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:24.930> try<00:01:25.259> making<00:01:25.890> this<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.040> less<00:01:26.280> hazy

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
ahead and try making this a less hazy

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.960 
ahead and try making this a less hazy
picture<00:01:27.060> by<00:01:27.659> using<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.110> reduce<00:01:28.470> haze<00:01:28.970> these

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
picture by using the reduce haze these

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.149 
picture by using the reduce haze these
are<00:01:30.150> very<00:01:30.450> strong<00:01:30.930> they're<00:01:31.590> meant<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:31.829> lift<00:01:32.070> a

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
are very strong they're meant to lift a

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.039 
are very strong they're meant to lift a
natural<00:01:32.640> haze<00:01:32.820> since<00:01:33.540> we<00:01:33.689> applied<00:01:34.020> it

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
natural haze since we applied it

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.230 
natural haze since we applied it
digitally<00:01:34.860> it's<00:01:35.340> going<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.520> be<00:01:35.670> pretty<00:01:35.820> strong

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
digitally it's going to be pretty strong

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.789 
digitally it's going to be pretty strong
even<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.720> light<00:01:36.900> ones<00:01:37.079> so<00:01:37.380> we're<00:01:37.500> going<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.680> go

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
even the light ones so we're going to go

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.280 
even the light ones so we're going to go
with<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:39.329> can<00:01:39.509> see<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:39.810> now<00:01:39.840> almost

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
with that and you can see it now almost

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.770 
with that and you can see it now almost
has<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.560> color<00:01:40.860> popped<00:01:41.159> look<00:01:41.640> and<00:01:41.939> we'll<00:01:42.630> go

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
has a color popped look and we'll go

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.389 
has a color popped look and we'll go
ahead<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.020> make<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.259> snapshot<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.829> this<00:01:44.070> and

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
ahead and make a snapshot of this and

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:53.300 
ahead and make a snapshot of this and
we'll<00:01:44.520> call<00:01:44.729> it<00:01:44.780> apple<00:01:49.430> porch<00:01:50.869> produce<00:01:52.310> haze

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
we'll call it apple porch produce haze

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.850 
we'll call it apple porch produce haze
and<00:01:53.790> we'll<00:01:54.570> create<00:01:54.780> that<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.380> then<00:01:55.770> we're

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
and we'll create that and then we're

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.380 
and we'll create that and then we're
