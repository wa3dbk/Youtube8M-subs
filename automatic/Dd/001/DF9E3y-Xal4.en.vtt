00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.620
 I think it was good we had the control 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.390
 of the game practically the 90 minutes 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.890
 it is clear that that final moment 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.120
 moment of despair of chile we 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.100
 we are prepared because already 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.270
 we were up against the wind a little bit 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.340
 which hinders the system a little 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.170
 defensive but I think the game the team 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.729
 played very well drive together 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.580
 overcome this inversion of the game 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.740
 we create at least 12 situations of 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:53.180
 goal is a very good average 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.130
 we can have extended the score that we 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.540
 would give a better tranquility but I think 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.190
 that time evolution has to happen 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.750
 within the competition that is very 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.610
 satisfied game of the two games 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.039
 that we have done for this 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.330
 the improvement was very marked and now 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:07.330
 recover enough for the second game
