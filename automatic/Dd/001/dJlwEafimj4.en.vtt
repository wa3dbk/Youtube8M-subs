the bombardier cseries to come let me

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.490 
the bombardier cseries to come let me
just<00:00:22.880> explain<00:00:23.240> some<00:00:23.660> of<00:00:23.690> the<00:00:23.869> features<00:00:23.900> we

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
just explain some of the features we

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.010 
just explain some of the features we
actually<00:00:25.279> designed<00:00:25.730> this<00:00:26.029> cabin<00:00:26.449> with<00:00:26.869> the

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.020 
actually designed this cabin with the

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.910 
actually designed this cabin with the
passenger<00:00:27.500> in<00:00:27.650> mind<00:00:27.859> obviously<00:00:28.789> and

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:29.920 
passenger in mind obviously and

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.439 
passenger in mind obviously and
basically<00:00:30.920> we<00:00:31.189> upsize<00:00:32.149> the<00:00:32.419> seats<00:00:32.920> so

00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:34.449 
basically we upsize the seats so

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:37.239 
basically we upsize the seats so
everyone<00:00:35.449> in<00:00:35.600> this<00:00:36.019> cabin<00:00:36.409> gets<00:00:36.620> an<00:00:36.769> eighteen

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:37.249 
everyone in this cabin gets an eighteen

00:00:37.249 --> 00:00:39.669 
everyone in this cabin gets an eighteen

eight and a half inch seat from the

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:43.989 
eight and a half inch seat from the
window<00:00:40.460> the<00:00:41.449> aisle<00:00:41.659> the<00:00:42.530> aisle<00:00:42.710> the<00:00:43.579> window

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:43.999 
window the aisle the aisle the window

00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:47.799 
window the aisle the aisle the window
and<00:00:44.300> further<00:00:45.069> the<00:00:46.069> worst<00:00:46.309> seat<00:00:46.579> on<00:00:46.850> the<00:00:47.030> five

00:00:47.799 --> 00:00:47.809 
and further the worst seat on the five

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:49.719 
and further the worst seat on the five
abreast<00:00:48.109> aircraft<00:00:48.769> is<00:00:49.010> normally<00:00:49.339> the<00:00:49.460> middle

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:49.729 
abreast aircraft is normally the middle

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:52.479 
abreast aircraft is normally the middle
seat<00:00:49.940> we've<00:00:50.420> actually<00:00:51.010> increased<00:00:52.010> the<00:00:52.280> width

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
seat we've actually increased the width

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:54.340 
seat we've actually increased the width
flat<00:00:52.760> seat<00:00:53.030> for<00:00:53.239> that<00:00:53.299> passenger<00:00:53.839> by<00:00:54.019> half<00:00:54.199> an

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
flat seat for that passenger by half an

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.279 
flat seat for that passenger by half an
inch<00:00:54.499> so<00:00:54.769> this<00:00:55.159> seat<00:00:55.459> is<00:00:55.670> not<00:00:55.879> a<00:00:55.989> 19-inch<00:00:56.989> seat

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
inch so this seat is not a 19-inch seat

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.189 
inch so this seat is not a 19-inch seat
we've<00:00:58.190> explained<00:00:58.699> this<00:00:58.940> to<00:00:59.209> a<00:00:59.239> lot<00:00:59.869> of<00:00:59.989> North

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
we've explained this to a lot of North

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:01.959 
we've explained this to a lot of North
American<00:01:00.709> customers<00:01:01.190> are<00:01:01.339> actually<00:01:01.519> said

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
American customers are actually said

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:04.180 
American customers are actually said
while<00:01:02.659> we<00:01:02.929> can<00:01:03.049> actually<00:01:03.229> charge<00:01:03.679> we<00:01:03.920> can<00:01:03.949> also

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
while we can actually charge we can also

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.610 
while we can actually charge we can also
get<00:01:04.489> some<00:01:04.520> revenue<00:01:05.150> for<00:01:05.180> this<00:01:05.840> size<00:01:06.230> of<00:01:06.410> seat

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:06.620 
get some revenue for this size of seat

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.590 
get some revenue for this size of seat
so<00:01:07.190> it's<00:01:07.340> a<00:01:07.430> big<00:01:07.610> hit<00:01:07.820> with<00:01:08.000> with<00:01:08.420> other

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
so it's a big hit with with other

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.620 
so it's a big hit with with other
potential<00:01:09.440> customers<00:01:10.010> in<00:01:10.160> this<00:01:10.250> movie<00:01:10.520> so<00:01:10.880> one

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
potential customers in this movie so one

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.450 
potential customers in this movie so one
of<00:01:11.660> the<00:01:11.900> other<00:01:11.930> key<00:01:12.290> features<00:01:12.770> of<00:01:12.800> our

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
of the other key features of our

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.790 
of the other key features of our
fuselage<00:01:14.330> would<00:01:14.630> be<00:01:14.780> the<00:01:14.930> actual<00:01:15.200> space<00:01:15.560> that

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800 
fuselage would be the actual space that

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.890 
fuselage would be the actual space that
we<00:01:15.890> give<00:01:16.070> to<00:01:16.100> the<00:01:16.310> passenger<00:01:16.910> at<00:01:17.510> a<00:01:17.570> shoulder

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:17.900 
we give to the passenger at a shoulder

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.640 
we give to the passenger at a shoulder
level<00:01:18.260> and<00:01:18.530> at<00:01:19.160> a<00:01:19.220> head<00:01:19.520> level

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.650 
level and at a head level

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.220 
level and at a head level
unlike<00:01:21.640> existing<00:01:22.200> single-aisle<00:01:23.200> aircraft

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.230 
unlike existing single-aisle aircraft

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.590 
unlike existing single-aisle aircraft
which<00:01:23.980> were<00:01:24.130> designed<00:01:24.340> as<00:01:24.790> two<00:01:25.000> circles<00:01:25.510> a

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
which were designed as two circles a

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.360 
which were designed as two circles a
circle<00:01:25.630> on<00:01:26.110> the<00:01:26.230> top<00:01:26.410> for<00:01:26.710> passengers<00:01:27.160> a

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:27.370 
circle on the top for passengers a

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.030 
circle on the top for passengers a
circle<00:01:28.090> on<00:01:28.210> the<00:01:28.300> bottom<00:01:28.330> for<00:01:29.080> Freight<00:01:29.320> we<00:01:29.950> have

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
circle on the bottom for Freight we have

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.090 
circle on the bottom for Freight we have
actually<00:01:30.430> designed<00:01:30.610> this<00:01:31.500> aircraft<00:01:32.500> so<00:01:32.920> that

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
actually designed this aircraft so that

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.550 
actually designed this aircraft so that
it<00:01:33.310> maximizes<00:01:34.150> the<00:01:34.510> space<00:01:34.540> at<00:01:35.020> the<00:01:35.110> shoulder

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
it maximizes the space at the shoulder

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.340 
it maximizes the space at the shoulder
and<00:01:36.130> at<00:01:36.310> the<00:01:36.460> head<00:01:36.700> the<00:01:37.480> shape<00:01:37.750> of<00:01:37.930> our<00:01:38.110> future

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
and at the head the shape of our future

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.520 
and at the head the shape of our future
lies<00:01:38.590> is<00:01:38.830> actually<00:01:39.220> employed<00:01:39.730> with<00:01:40.360> two<00:01:40.690> radii

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
lies is actually employed with two radii

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.200 
lies is actually employed with two radii
the<00:01:41.620> top<00:01:42.040> should<00:01:42.460> really<00:01:42.790> at<00:01:42.940> the<00:01:43.090> bottom

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
the top should really at the bottom

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.560 
the top should really at the bottom
burned<00:01:44.170> in<00:01:44.320> between<00:01:44.680> so<00:01:45.310> you<00:01:45.370> get<00:01:45.610> this<00:01:45.820> a<00:01:46.030> lot

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
burned in between so you get this a lot

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.080 
burned in between so you get this a lot
of<00:01:46.750> space<00:01:47.050> at<00:01:47.290> the<00:01:47.500> shoulder<00:01:47.980> and<00:01:48.220> around<00:01:48.940> the

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
of space at the shoulder and around the

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.660 
of space at the shoulder and around the
head<00:01:49.300> it's<00:01:50.020> more<00:01:50.290> like<00:01:50.500> a<00:01:50.530> wide-body<00:01:51.130> comfort

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
head it's more like a wide-body comfort

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.980 
head it's more like a wide-body comfort
you<00:01:51.790> would<00:01:51.940> see<00:01:52.180> a<00:01:52.210> triple<00:01:52.960> 7<00:01:53.670> 787<00:01:54.870> maxed<00:01:55.870> up

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
you would see a triple 7 787 maxed up

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.200 
you would see a triple 7 787 maxed up
the<00:01:56.140> size<00:01:56.350> of<00:01:56.680> a<00:01:56.890> window<00:01:57.550> you<00:01:57.700> would<00:01:57.850> normally

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
the size of a window you would normally

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.600 
the size of a window you would normally
see<00:01:58.450> on<00:01:58.660> a<00:01:58.750> single<00:01:59.320> on<00:01:59.440> aircraft<00:01:59.920> this<00:02:00.550> is

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
see on a single on aircraft this is

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.730 
see on a single on aircraft this is
actually<00:02:01.090> the<00:02:01.240> same<00:02:01.480> size<00:02:01.510> is<00:02:01.960> a<00:02:01.990> triple<00:02:02.410> 7

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
actually the same size is a triple 7

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.280 
actually the same size is a triple 7
window<00:02:03.220> we've<00:02:04.180> actually<00:02:04.360> placed<00:02:04.840> them<00:02:05.050> at<00:02:05.170> the

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
window we've actually placed them at the

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:07.230 
window we've actually placed them at the
right<00:02:05.440> height<00:02:05.650> so<00:02:06.430> when<00:02:06.610> you<00:02:06.700> turn<00:02:06.910> right<00:02:07.090> into

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
right height so when you turn right into

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.060 
right height so when you turn right into
the<00:02:07.450> guide<00:02:07.630> the<00:02:07.780> window<00:02:08.110> you<00:02:08.590> don't<00:02:08.800> have<00:02:08.950> to

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
the guide the window you don't have to

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.010 
the guide the window you don't have to
bend<00:02:09.280> down<00:02:09.610> you<00:02:09.880> don't<00:02:10.030> have<00:02:10.179> to<00:02:10.420> squint<00:02:10.690> back

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
bend down you don't have to squint back

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.020
