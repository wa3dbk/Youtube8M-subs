00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:10.850 

good<00:00:08.429> evening<00:00:08.580> folks<00:00:08.790> um<00:00:09.120> I<00:00:09.540> won't<00:00:10.469> about<00:00:10.679> this

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
good evening folks um I won't about this

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.640 
good evening folks um I won't about this
before<00:00:11.250> and<00:00:11.660> my<00:00:12.660> earlier<00:00:12.990> videos<00:00:13.380> that<00:00:13.620> I

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
before and my earlier videos that I

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.910 
before and my earlier videos that I
believe<00:00:14.070> that<00:00:14.690> it's<00:00:15.690> quite<00:00:16.170> a<00:00:16.199> possibility

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
believe that it's quite a possibility

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.130 
believe that it's quite a possibility
that<00:00:16.949> gold<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:17.640> silver<00:00:18.000> will<00:00:18.240> collapse<00:00:19.160> to

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
that gold and silver will collapse to

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.040 
that gold and silver will collapse to
unreal<00:00:22.140> price<00:00:22.439> because<00:00:23.570> the<00:00:24.570> price<00:00:24.779> that<00:00:24.960> you

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
unreal price because the price that you

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.009 
unreal price because the price that you
see<00:00:25.230> is<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.380> paper<00:00:25.650> price<00:00:25.980> and<00:00:26.720> the<00:00:27.720> price<00:00:27.750> that

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
see is a paper price and the price that

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.659 
see is a paper price and the price that
of<00:00:28.980> real<00:00:29.849> physical<00:00:30.390> silver<00:00:30.630> is<00:00:31.009> someone<00:00:32.009> far

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
of real physical silver is someone far

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.319 
of real physical silver is someone far
north<00:00:32.969> of<00:00:33.120> that<00:00:33.329> so<00:00:34.700> another<00:00:35.700> reason<00:00:36.030> why<00:00:36.120> we

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
north of that so another reason why we

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.630 
north of that so another reason why we
will<00:00:36.809> most<00:00:37.020> likely<00:00:37.290> see<00:00:37.620> that<00:00:37.829> is<00:00:38.010> because<00:00:38.399> in

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
will most likely see that is because in

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.830 
will most likely see that is because in
every<00:00:39.210> single<00:00:39.540> case<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:40.110> monetary<00:00:40.620> debasement

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
every single case of monetary debasement

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.319 
every single case of monetary debasement
governments<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.050> ficials<00:00:43.559> have<00:00:44.280> done<00:00:44.940> price

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
governments and ficials have done price

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.110 
governments and ficials have done price
controls<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.700> so<00:00:47.700> price<00:00:47.940> controls<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.660> normal

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
controls and so price controls is normal

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.990 
controls and so price controls is normal
so<00:00:51.120> we<00:00:51.480> should<00:00:51.510> see<00:00:51.899> that<00:00:52.170> in<00:00:52.440> in<00:00:53.190> silver<00:00:53.969> and

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
so we should see that in in silver and

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.630 
so we should see that in in silver and
gold<00:00:54.480> when<00:00:55.170> when<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.680> price<00:00:55.890> starts<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.460> take

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
gold when when the price starts to take

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.950 
gold when when the price starts to take
off<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.000> government's<00:00:57.420> not<00:00:57.570> going<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.840> like

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
off the government's not going to like

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.200 
off the government's not going to like
it<00:00:58.609> eventually<00:00:59.609> they<00:00:59.760> just<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.180> know

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
it eventually they just you know

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.840 
it eventually they just you know
separate<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.250> paper<00:01:02.250> price<00:01:02.550> from<00:01:02.730> the

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
separate the paper price from the

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.310 
separate the paper price from the
physical<00:01:03.000> price<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.629> say<00:01:03.780> well<00:01:03.989> that's<00:01:04.140> the

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
physical price and say well that's the

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.190 
physical price and say well that's the
price<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:05.090> if<00:01:06.090> you're<00:01:06.390> selling<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:06.810> less<00:01:06.990> than

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
price and if you're selling it less than

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.890 
price and if you're selling it less than
that<00:01:07.350> I<00:01:07.650> mean<00:01:08.490> more<00:01:08.880> than<00:01:08.939> that<00:01:09.180> then<00:01:09.450> you're

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.479 
then more money and more money coming in
then<00:03:41.940> then<00:03:42.360> the<00:03:42.510> goal<00:03:42.690> would<00:03:42.900> provide<00:03:43.260> so<00:03:43.650> so

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
then then the goal would provide so so

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.000 
then then the goal would provide so so
it's<00:03:44.790> going<00:03:45.030> to<00:03:45.150> happen<00:03:45.329> and<00:03:45.750> and<00:03:46.380> that's

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
it's going to happen and and that's

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.539 
it's going to happen and and that's
that's<00:03:47.579> that's<00:03:47.970> why<00:03:48.269> I'm<00:03:48.600> gold<00:03:49.110> wall<00:03:49.549> will

they come back down to like seven
thousand<00:04:00.870> or<00:04:00.959> something<00:04:01.200> like<00:04:01.260> that<00:04:01.320> in

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
thousand or something like that in

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.310 
thousand or something like that in
