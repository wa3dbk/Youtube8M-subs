00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
it essentially that's the beauty of this

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.230 
it essentially that's the beauty of this
HK<00:04:47.630> 250gt<00:04:48.200> is<00:04:48.590> that<00:04:49.340> I'm<00:04:49.550> not<00:04:49.730> afraid<00:04:49.940> to<00:04:49.970> crash

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
HK 250gt is that I'm not afraid to crash

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.880 
HK 250gt is that I'm not afraid to crash
it<00:04:50.390> I<00:04:50.450> can<00:04:50.540> just<00:04:50.660> bombing<00:04:50.840> around<00:04:51.170> and<00:04:51.350> if<00:04:51.770> it

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:51.890 
it I can just bombing around and if it

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.450 
it I can just bombing around and if it
hits<00:04:52.070> the<00:04:52.130> ground<00:04:52.340> great<00:04:53.090> and<00:04:53.800> putting<00:04:54.800> a<00:04:54.950> $10

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
hits the ground great and putting a $10

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.140 
hits the ground great and putting a $10
Charles<00:04:56.320> $110<00:04:57.320> on<00:04:57.620> it<00:04:57.830> that<00:04:58.490> makes<00:04:58.790> all<00:04:59.000> the

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
Charles $110 on it that makes all the

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.110 
Charles $110 on it that makes all the
difference<00:04:59.180> to<00:04:59.510> me<00:04:59.830> so<00:05:00.830> it<00:05:01.490> gives<00:05:01.790> me<00:05:02.000> I'm

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
difference to me so it gives me I'm

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.960 
difference to me so it gives me I'm
gonna<00:05:02.300> give<00:05:02.420> it<00:05:02.510> sort<00:05:02.630> of<00:05:02.750> a<00:05:03.460> semi<00:05:04.460> thumbs<00:05:04.760> up

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
gonna give it sort of a semi thumbs up

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:06.280

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
of it with the thumbs but in real life

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.980 
of it with the thumbs but in real life
it<00:05:27.920> seemed<00:05:28.100> to<00:05:28.190> hold<00:05:28.280> up<00:05:28.430> really<00:05:28.550> well<00:05:28.840> so<00:05:29.840> this
