00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
breathing now to deepen it I'll take and

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.500 
breathing now to deepen it I'll take and
I'll<00:02:12.270> work<00:02:12.569> the<00:02:12.750> scapula<00:02:13.319> out<00:02:13.500> of<00:02:13.709> the<00:02:13.770> way

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
I'll work the scapula out of the way

take the tennis ball and now I'm going
to<00:02:16.950> specifically<00:02:17.610> work<00:02:17.810> those<00:02:18.810> rhomboids

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
to specifically work those rhomboids

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:23.030 
to specifically work those rhomboids
that<00:02:20.549> attach<00:02:20.970> and<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:22.379> reason<00:02:22.620> why<00:02:22.709> we<00:02:22.860> keep

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
that attach and the reason why we keep

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.440 
that attach and the reason why we keep
working<00:02:23.280> those<00:02:23.640> is<00:02:23.819> these<00:02:24.000> are<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.269> muscles

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
working those is these are the muscles

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.910 
working those is these are the muscles
that<00:02:24.629> are<00:02:24.780> responsible<00:02:24.810> for<00:02:25.349> pulling<00:02:25.799> your

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
that are responsible for pulling your

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.250 
that are responsible for pulling your
shoulder<00:02:26.250> blades<00:02:26.489> back<00:02:26.879> so<00:02:27.629> they<00:02:27.750> get<00:02:27.900> a<00:02:27.959> lot

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
shoulder blades back so they get a lot

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.559 
shoulder blades back so they get a lot
of<00:02:28.319> work<00:02:28.709> especially<00:02:28.920> if<00:02:29.370> you<00:02:29.459> do<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:29.909> lot<00:02:30.540> of

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
of work especially if you do a lot of

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:32.780
