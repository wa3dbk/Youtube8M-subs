00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.160
 people next who is talking 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.560
 romario's deputy 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.130
 Former soccer player romario edmundo 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.070
 romario 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.640
 Who is speaking here is the Brazilian. 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:27.420
 Romario I want to start this speech of mine. 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.609
 that the first congratulating the people 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.510
 for these manifestations 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:36.540
 made yesterday 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:39.870
 today I believe that they continued 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:43.530
 I also believe that as of yesterday 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.580
 and manifests itself with these attitudes of the 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.290
 our people 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:50.250
 our rulers have to understand 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:56.210
 definitely from now on that the 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:01:00.299
 day shenanigans slutty theft 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.799
 dishonesty, lack of respect for 

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:05.790
 people 

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:08.670
 that's the policy of brazil her 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.000
 definitely it has to serve to 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:17.250
 to do good 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.600
 I respect what we see there I will speak 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.490
 some data for you that I have 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.859
 sure that the world knows 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.409
 Just to register Brazil when 

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:27.390
 accepted to be the host country of the world cup 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.789
 in 2007 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.210
 the forecast was for more or 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:35.880
 minus 20 3 billion 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:40.259
 we are in 2013 this forecast already 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.329
 it's 28 and we can not forget 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.600
 the world cup 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:56.700
 still a year and a few months away 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:02:01.679
 you imagine 7.1 billion reais 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.149
 This could provide Brazil with the 

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:07.009
 following situations that I will say 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:13.800
 here eight thousand and eight thousand new schools 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:16.000
 could of the population 39 thousand buses 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:21.710
 school children 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.690
 28 thousand sports courts across the country 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.380
 the money that was spent on the mane 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:30.380
 garrencha you want to know 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:34.010
 could be built 150 thousand houses 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:36.650
 low-income people 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:40.640
 average income of people who do not have 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:43.100
 but do not go there and we put almost 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:48.080
 one and a half billion in the stadium where 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:54.020
 was beautiful reaping practical not much 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:55.130
 and a year from the 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.200
 confederations 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.540
 there after the Confederations Cup good 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.550
 some things have to be redone 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.570
 that did not work out and new things to 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:08.120
 the world cup that determines this 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:10.010
 is the real president of fifa today 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.800
 His name is the real president of 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.820
 country today is called fifa that fifa arrives 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.010
 here in our country 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:19.640
 set up a state within our state 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:27.020
 and this is another important piece of information 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:27.800
 last South Cup had an expense of 77 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:34.340
 billion 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:35.210
 Japan had an expenditure of 10.1 billion 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:40.040
 real 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:45.170
 Germany had an expenditure of 10.7 that the 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:47.960
 Brazil is already spending 28 points 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:51.170
 something or I 'm sorry to 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:55.550
 Stupid expression, huh? 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:59.210
 money is of the people is lack of respect 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:01.910
 it is a lack of scruple in something else that 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:04.630
 I could as well pass without speaking 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:07.130
 people know me that started 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:12.650
 Imagine how many people are 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:15.770
 thereby enriching the idea when 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:18.380
 arrived in the liberal house of the 

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:22.490
 my article 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:26.930
 and the deputy afonso hamm to ask 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:29.210
 we asked that fifa leave 10% of their 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:34.280
 profit for the money to be 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:37.580
 fully invested in football 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:43.580
 of those teams that do not have much 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:46.640
 tradition and also in people with 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:50.120
 any kind of disability to be able to 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:54.110
 have opportunity to practice the sport 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:59.810
 until today you will not leave something else 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:05:02.330
 last year the commission that exists in 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:05.350
 parliamentary front house in defense of 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:10.430
 disabled person had almost everyone 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:13.160
 us deputies in rio de janeiro through 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:17.570
 the president of the time, who 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:19.640
 through ronaldo at the time promised that 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:23.360
 disabled people with low 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:24.410
 would have 32 thousand tickets for the 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:29.960
 world Cup 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:31.220
 the current president of our country who 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:35.000
 fifa flame 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:38.350
 She's going to get here and she'll make a profit. 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.350
 4 billion reais 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:47.030
 and would have to pay more or less taxes 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:50.880
 sumbe and will not pay or she comes 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:54.270
 riding the circus and not spend any 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:57.530
 it takes everything to ask me if I am 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:59.520
 against the world cup is not enough 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:03.449
 and I'll say more 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:05.039
 back when the country received as a country 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:07.590
 seat of the world cup I was there 

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:11.280
 present and made me the two questions 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:13.260
 Brazil is going to be a father is in a position to do 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.270
 the world cup and is able to do 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:18.150
 one of the big ones my response from that 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:21.030
 of that time was not only conditional 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.750
 how will you make the largest cup of all 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:24.720
 times 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:28.729
 only after so many years of 2007 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:28.729
 this way things
