how<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.599> make<00:00:15.780> 3d<00:00:16.049> text<00:00:16.440> but<00:00:17.340> as<00:00:17.460> far<00:00:17.789> as<00:00:17.850> I've

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
how to make 3d text but as far as I've

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.279 
how to make 3d text but as far as I've
seen<00:00:18.119> none<00:00:18.449> of<00:00:18.539> them<00:00:18.660> really<00:00:18.750> explain<00:00:19.170> the

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
seen none of them really explain the

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.950 
seen none of them really explain the
specifics<00:00:19.949> of<00:00:20.130> making<00:00:20.910> 3d<00:00:21.180> text<00:00:21.600> even<00:00:21.779> though

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
specifics of making 3d text even though

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.019 
specifics of making 3d text even though
it's<00:00:22.109> pretty<00:00:22.289> straightforward<00:00:22.730> so<00:00:23.730> i'm<00:00:23.939> going

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
it's pretty straightforward so i'm going

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.400 
it's pretty straightforward so i'm going
to<00:00:24.119> show<00:00:24.180> you<00:00:24.210> guys<00:00:24.330> how<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.570> make<00:00:24.689> 3d<00:00:25.050> text

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
to show you guys how to make 3d text

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.859 
to show you guys how to make 3d text
using<00:00:25.890> two<00:00:26.099> methods<00:00:26.490> one<00:00:26.580> of<00:00:27.269> them<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.539> using

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
using two methods one of them is using

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.810 
using two methods one of them is using
the<00:00:27.990> mobile<00:00:28.199> app<00:00:28.410> text<00:00:28.830> and<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.550> other<00:00:29.670> is

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
the mobile app text and the other is

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.440 
the mobile app text and the other is
using<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.240> text<00:00:30.689> blind<00:00:31.019> with<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:32.450> extrude

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
using the text blind with the extrude

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.540 
using the text blind with the extrude
NURBS<00:00:33.649> so<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.770> first<00:00:34.980> way<00:00:35.130> i'm<00:00:35.280> going<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.460> show

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
NURBS so the first way i'm going to show

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.790 
NURBS so the first way i'm going to show
you<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:35.910> with<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.360> text<00:00:36.690> line<00:00:36.899> so<00:00:37.530> if<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.680> go

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
you is with the text line so if you go

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.010 
you is with the text line so if you go
into<00:00:37.980> your<00:00:38.160> spline<00:00:38.520> box<00:00:38.850> right<00:00:39.120> here<00:00:39.149> you<00:00:39.870> want

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
into your spline box right here you want

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.660 
into your spline box right here you want
to<00:00:40.079> go<00:00:40.170> ahead<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.530> click<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.219> hold<00:00:41.309> on<00:00:41.520> it

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
to go ahead and click and hold on it

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.110 
to go ahead and click and hold on it
until<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.390> menu<00:00:42.809> pops<00:00:43.020> up<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.730> select<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.910> text

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
until a menu pops up and select the text

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.900 
until a menu pops up and select the text
blind<00:00:45.620> now<00:00:46.620> with<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.890> text<00:00:47.219> line<00:00:47.370> it's<00:00:47.550> not<00:00:47.730> an

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
blind now with the text line it's not an

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.220 
blind now with the text line it's not an
actual<00:00:48.120> object<00:00:48.840> what<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.680> is<00:00:50.960> what<00:00:51.960> i<00:00:51.989> like

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
actual object what it is is what i like

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.250 
actual object what it is is what i like
to<00:00:52.350> call<00:00:52.379> sort<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.340> blueprints<00:00:53.879> for<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.840> 3d

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
to call sort of the blueprints for a 3d

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.439 
to call sort of the blueprints for a 3d
model<00:00:55.469> because<00:00:55.949> it's<00:00:56.280> not<00:00:56.489> an<00:00:56.610> object<00:00:56.760> yet<00:00:57.149> but

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
model because it's not an object yet but

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.490 
model because it's not an object yet but
it's<00:00:57.660> going<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:57.989> be<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.140> shape<00:00:58.649> for<00:00:59.399> an<00:00:59.489> object

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
it's going to be a shape for an object

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.060 
it's going to be a shape for an object
so<00:01:01.500> if<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:01.770> go<00:01:01.890> into<00:01:02.039> your<00:01:02.219> object<00:01:02.930> attributes

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
so if you go into your object attributes

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.530 
so if you go into your object attributes
you<00:01:05.070> have<00:01:05.189> your<00:01:05.369> text<00:01:05.729> you<00:01:05.820> can<00:01:05.909> edit<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.299> so

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
you have your text you can edit it so

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:15.770 
you have your text you can edit it so
let's<00:01:07.110> say<00:01:09.049> 3d<00:01:10.220> text<00:01:13.549> here<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:14.700> of<00:01:15.390> course<00:01:15.659> you

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
let's say 3d text here and of course you

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.440 
let's say 3d text here and of course you
can<00:01:15.900> choose<00:01:16.200> your<00:01:16.320> font<00:01:16.820> so<00:01:17.820> if<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:18.030> select<00:01:18.330> as

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
can choose your font so if you select as

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.830 
can choose your font so if you select as
many<00:01:18.479> you<00:01:18.780> can<00:01:18.930> choose<00:01:20.090> what<00:01:21.090> font<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:21.720> would

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
many you can choose what font you would

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.800 
many you can choose what font you would
like<00:01:21.960> your<00:01:22.080> text<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.560> be<00:01:26.240> and<00:01:27.240> also<00:01:27.360> you<00:01:27.689> can

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
like your text to be and also you can

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.380 
like your text to be and also you can
align<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.320> either<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.829> the<00:01:28.920> middle<00:01:29.220> of<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.460> z

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
align it either to the middle of the z

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.660 
align it either to the middle of the z
axis<00:01:30.470> to<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.530> left<00:01:31.829> of<00:01:31.979> it<00:01:32.130> or<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.970> the<00:01:33.000> right

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
axis to the left of it or to the right

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.740 
axis to the left of it or to the right
you<00:01:35.670> can<00:01:35.820> change<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.180> scale<00:01:36.509> of<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:38.750> increase

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
you can change the scale of it increase

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:47.460 
you can change the scale of it increase
the<00:01:39.990> spacing<00:01:40.290> between<00:01:40.650> each<00:01:41.130> letter<00:01:41.430> and

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.730 

increase<00:01:48.370> the<00:01:48.760> vertical<00:01:49.630> spacing<00:01:50.500> between

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
increase the vertical spacing between

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.580 
increase the vertical spacing between
each<00:01:51.190> line<00:01:51.520> of<00:01:51.550> text<00:01:52.140> now<00:01:53.140> there<00:01:53.290> isn't<00:01:53.410> a

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
each line of text now there isn't a

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.140 
each line of text now there isn't a
whole<00:01:53.620> lot<00:01:53.860> you<00:01:54.190> can<00:01:54.220> do<00:01:54.430> with<00:01:54.460> this<00:01:54.730> because

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:55.150 
whole lot you can do with this because

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.420 
whole lot you can do with this because
after<00:01:56.110> all<00:01:56.140> it's<00:01:56.380> only<00:01:56.500> in<00:01:56.710> text<00:01:57.010> line<00:01:57.160> and

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
after all it's only in text line and

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.680 
after all it's only in text line and
I'll<00:01:57.790> explain<00:01:58.090> the<00:01:58.150> difference<00:01:58.540> between

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
I'll explain the difference between

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.110 
I'll explain the difference between
mograph<00:01:59.320> and<00:01:59.470> text<00:01:59.800> lines<00:02:00.040> later<00:02:00.940> on

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120 
mograph and text lines later on

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.320 
mograph and text lines later on
throughout<00:02:01.390> the<00:02:01.540> video<00:02:01.860> so<00:02:02.860> to<00:02:02.920> make<00:02:03.520> it<00:02:03.580> a<00:02:03.820> 3d

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
throughout the video so to make it a 3d

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.110 
throughout the video so to make it a 3d
text<00:02:04.810> you<00:02:05.080> go<00:02:05.320> into<00:02:05.590> your<00:02:05.620> extrude<00:02:06.250> NURBS<00:02:06.280> or

over here in the extrude NURBS you can

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:11.729 
over here in the extrude NURBS you can

change the caps and more caps do
basically<00:03:12.190> is<00:03:12.330> kind<00:03:13.330> of<00:03:13.450> flatten<00:03:13.900> out<00:03:14.019> the

edges of your text so if I go to the
start<00:03:17.350> cap<00:03:17.980> and<00:03:18.310> make<00:03:18.940> it<00:03:19.060> a<00:03:19.209> full<00:03:19.510> a<00:03:19.660> cap<00:03:20.880> it'll

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
start cap and make it a full a cap it'll

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.240 
start cap and make it a full a cap it'll
flatten<00:03:22.269> out<00:03:22.510> the<00:03:22.540> edges<00:03:22.840> in<00:03:23.470> order<00:03:23.709> to<00:03:24.010> create

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
flatten out the edges in order to create

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.270 
flatten out the edges in order to create
more<00:03:24.820> polygon<00:03:25.570> faces<00:03:25.810> around<00:03:26.560> the<00:03:26.709> text<00:03:27.100> and

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
more polygon faces around the text and

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.670 
more polygon faces around the text and
that<00:03:27.910> can<00:03:28.090> increase<00:03:28.480> the<00:03:28.510> radius<00:03:28.930> to<00:03:29.380> make

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
that can increase the radius to make

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.020 
that can increase the radius to make
that<00:03:31.350> polygon<00:03:32.350> faces<00:03:32.680> around<00:03:33.190> the<00:03:33.370> edges<00:03:33.519> much

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
that polygon faces around the edges much

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.280 
that polygon faces around the edges much
more<00:03:34.209> bigger<00:03:34.420> and<00:03:34.739> for<00:03:35.739> the<00:03:35.799> steps<00:03:37.140> what<00:03:38.140> these

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
more bigger and for the steps what these

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.250 
more bigger and for the steps what these
do<00:03:38.530> is<00:03:38.820> the<00:03:39.820> more<00:03:40.030> steps<00:03:40.360> you<00:03:40.540> add<00:03:40.690> to<00:03:41.080> these

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
do is the more steps you add to these

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.740 
do is the more steps you add to these
edges<00:03:41.890> the<00:03:42.580> smoother<00:03:43.150> the<00:03:45.180> flake<00:03:46.180> apps<00:03:46.480> will

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
edges the smoother the flake apps will

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.420 
edges the smoother the flake apps will
be<00:03:46.900> so<00:03:47.170> right<00:03:47.440> now<00:03:47.470> you<00:03:47.620> can<00:03:47.799> see<00:03:47.950> it's<00:03:48.070> curved

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
be so right now you can see it's curved

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.259 
be so right now you can see it's curved
and<00:03:48.670> if<00:03:49.299> i<00:03:49.480> set<00:03:49.750> the<00:03:49.959> steps<00:03:50.260> back<00:03:50.590> to<00:03:50.920> one<00:03:51.310> it'll

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
and if i set the steps back to one it'll

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:57.500 
and if i set the steps back to one it'll
be<00:03:52.360> flat

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.290 

so<00:03:58.510> that's<00:03:58.660> all<00:03:58.900> there<00:03:59.140> really<00:03:59.170> is<00:03:59.380> to<00:04:00.300> making

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:01.300 
so that's all there really is to making

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.660 
so that's all there really is to making
3d<00:04:01.540> text<00:04:01.930> using<00:04:02.230> this<00:04:02.380> method<00:04:02.830> now<00:04:03.430> I'll<00:04:03.640> show

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
3d text using this method now I'll show

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.729 
3d text using this method now I'll show
you<00:04:03.940> the<00:04:04.120> way<00:04:04.270> to<00:04:04.330> make<00:04:04.900> 3d<00:04:05.200> text<00:04:05.500> using

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
you the way to make 3d text using

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.530 
you the way to make 3d text using
mograph<00:04:06.130> so<00:04:06.910> I've<00:04:07.000> go<00:04:07.120> into<00:04:07.330> your<00:04:07.450> mograph<00:04:08.220> and

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
mograph so I've go into your mograph and

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.300 
mograph so I've go into your mograph and
go<00:04:10.540> all<00:04:10.720> the<00:04:10.780> way<00:04:10.840> down<00:04:10.930> you<00:04:11.319> could<00:04:11.470> you<00:04:11.950> should

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
go all the way down you could you should

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.309 
go all the way down you could you should
see<00:04:12.580> mo<00:04:12.910> text<00:04:13.480> want<00:04:13.780> to<00:04:13.840> go<00:04:13.930> ahead<00:04:14.080> and<00:04:14.200> select

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 
see mo text want to go ahead and select

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.720 
see mo text want to go ahead and select
that<00:04:14.680> and<00:04:15.419> as<00:04:16.419> you<00:04:17.019> notice<00:04:17.440> the<00:04:18.250> text<00:04:18.639> is

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
that and as you notice the text is

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.870 
that and as you notice the text is
already<00:04:19.000> a<00:04:19.799> three-dimensional<00:04:20.799> object<00:04:21.280> so

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
already a three-dimensional object so

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.159 
already a three-dimensional object so
you<00:04:21.940> don't<00:04:22.210> need<00:04:22.300> to<00:04:22.389> add<00:04:22.510> any<00:04:22.540> extrude<00:04:23.139> NURBS

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169 
you don't need to add any extrude NURBS

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:27.990 
you don't need to add any extrude NURBS
to<00:04:23.650> it<00:04:24.210> as<00:04:25.680> you<00:04:26.680> see<00:04:26.860> has<00:04:27.040> the<00:04:27.160> same<00:04:27.370> text

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
to it as you see has the same text

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.629 
to it as you see has the same text
editing<00:04:28.419> objects<00:04:28.990> like<00:04:29.530> the<00:04:29.770> spline<00:04:30.100> text<00:04:30.460> and

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 
editing objects like the spline text and

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:34.350 
editing objects like the spline text and
it<00:04:31.419> has<00:04:31.600> the<00:04:31.960> caps<00:04:32.410> as<00:04:32.710> well<00:04:33.520> without<00:04:33.729> adding

it has the caps as well without adding

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.500 
it has the caps as well without adding
the<00:04:34.510> extrude<00:04:34.870> NURBS<00:04:35.790> so<00:04:36.790> again<00:04:36.970> this<00:04:37.210> is<00:04:37.389> all

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
the extrude NURBS so again this is all

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.120 
the extrude NURBS so again this is all
pretty<00:04:37.630> straightforward<00:04:37.900> got<00:04:38.590> the<00:04:38.710> text

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
pretty straightforward got the text

use<00:07:01.060> the<00:07:01.300> mograph<00:07:01.810> text<00:07:02.320> but<00:07:03.070> in<00:07:03.520> my<00:07:03.820> opinion<00:07:03.940> I

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:04.300 
use the mograph text but in my opinion I

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.810 
use the mograph text but in my opinion I
think<00:07:04.330> mograph<00:07:04.840> text<00:07:05.200> is<00:07:05.430> better<00:07:06.430> for<00:07:06.700> all

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:06.820 
think mograph text is better for all

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:08.760 
think mograph text is better for all
purposes<00:07:07.090> whether<00:07:08.020> or<00:07:08.229> not<00:07:08.320> you're<00:07:08.500> animating
