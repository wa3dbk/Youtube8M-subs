the garden and this little rock says
believe<00:01:48.240> should<00:01:48.720> have<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:48.930> believe<00:01:49.170> in

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
believe should have to believe in

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.940 
believe should have to believe in
fairies<00:01:49.890> and<00:01:50.930> let's<00:01:51.930> see<00:01:52.290> what<00:01:52.530> else<00:01:52.770> the

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
fairies and let's see what else the

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.990 
fairies and let's see what else the
bench<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:53.579> had<00:01:54.030> by<00:01:54.720> coincidence<00:01:55.520> from<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.610> garden

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
bench I had by coincidence from a garden

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.389 
bench I had by coincidence from a garden
show<00:01:57.210> that<00:01:57.509> I<00:01:57.540> bought<00:01:58.530> for<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:58.829> reason<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.280> I

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
show that I bought for a reason and I

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.539 
show that I bought for a reason and I
guess<00:01:59.549> this<00:01:59.729> is<00:01:59.909> a<00:01:59.939> reason<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:01.130> I<00:02:02.130> just<00:02:02.369> wanted

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
guess this is a reason and I just wanted

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.249 
guess this is a reason and I just wanted
to<00:02:02.610> show<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.119> stepping<00:02:03.600> stones<00:02:03.930> this

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
to show you the stepping stones this

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.230 
to show you the stepping stones this

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
which is fun but if you really think

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:11.840 
which is fun but if you really think
about<00:02:11.009> it<00:02:11.280> you<00:02:11.340> could<00:02:11.459> use

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
about it you could use

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.330 
about it you could use
a lot<00:02:11.970> of<00:02:12.120> other<00:02:12.450> ideas<00:02:12.860> so<00:02:13.860> here's<00:02:14.130> the

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
and like I said you could really I

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.010 
and like I said you could really I
suppose<00:02:38.310> just<00:02:38.730> a<00:02:38.790> branch<00:02:39.090> that<00:02:39.360> I<00:02:39.420> stuck<00:02:39.810> in

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
suppose just a branch that I stuck in

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.470 
suppose just a branch that I stuck in
and<00:02:40.290> I'm<00:02:40.920> going<00:02:41.070> to<00:02:41.160> set<00:02:41.490> it<00:02:41.640> under<00:02:42.030> that<00:02:42.240> under

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
and I'm going to set it under that under

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.780 
and I'm going to set it under that under
my<00:02:42.900> tree<00:02:43.530> here<00:02:43.710> because<00:02:43.980> I<00:02:44.010> feel<00:02:44.280> like<00:02:44.340> when<00:02:44.670> it

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
my tree here because I feel like when it

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.480 
my tree here because I feel like when it
rains<00:02:44.930> the<00:02:45.930> trio<00:02:46.230> break<00:02:46.530> its<00:02:46.710> fall<00:02:46.980> a<00:02:47.010> little

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
rains the trio break its fall a little

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:53.150 
rains the trio break its fall a little
so<00:02:47.910> it<00:02:48.000> won't<00:02:48.210> get<00:02:48.390> so<00:02:48.630> damaged<00:02:51.920> so<00:02:52.920> I'm<00:02:53.010> going

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
so it won't get so damaged so I'm going

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:59.040 
so it won't get so damaged so I'm going
to<00:02:53.190> set<00:02:53.460> it<00:02:53.580> here

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.180
