00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.750
 the staff was doing all there good morning everyone 

00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:11.340
 the pilgrims there also staff the following 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:15.509
 I'm making this video I wanted more 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:18.449
 parameter effect is now with the 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.830
 my the method my car I want to see 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.960
 How much can I do with the tank? 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:28.260
 running the road now I'm going 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:32.610
 direction to the tides a little bit josé ia 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:35.940
 more to drive while filling the tank 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.520
 of it with ordinary gasoline at 3 and 14 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:47.250
 I had a room in the tank and it filled with 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:50.070
 or $ 174 god 55 liters already had and 15 15 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.850
 in the tank will not complete with 70 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.180
 liters 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.510
 Now I want to see when it will do with 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.899
 a diego paiva dodo tank that 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:06.510
 was able to run almost 700 kilometers 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:09.060
 the 98 omega 98 will also see how 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.700
 he's doing with his fashion 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.710
 I prayed the onboard computer now 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.619
 average consumption avoided in view of 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.220
 where there is very true dance in 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:24.750
 home of 9 from boleto school in 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:27.119
 autonomy giving 722 kilometers that 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.170
 who also believes that it will not be 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.200
 very cool because I'll take in 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.920
 consideration here is no calculation 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.460
 What I'm going to do, I'm going to 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:42.090
 board computer fishing there saying 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.610
 that I have 50 kilometers to run the 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.229
 yale and hitting that which is practically 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.079
 enter a reservation right 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.899
 I think even a little bit already in reserve 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.869
 I can get a good idea is that 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.759
 these people have doubts about how much 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.700
 car will be when he manages to do 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.520
 with tank town to making this video 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.830
 To take this crusade away. 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.600
 mine too 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.340
 Suddenly to anyone who wants to be 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.490
 who has to have a better idea of ​​the 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.530
 apparent consumption share to these 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.950
 information also for those who are 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.940
 huh 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.670
 al galley that size is is Pedro 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:23.000
 Good Sunday, everyone, big hug to you. 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.250
 all bathrooms and then there when 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:32.060
 I finished the tank with your other video 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:33.050
 say how it was and now 145 now to 88 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.150
 kilometers 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:39.770
 So I'll tell you how it feels 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:45.590
 square the staff was good night guys 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:49.430
 beauty and good touch in gift pedro i is gift 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:54.200
 Pedro I'm 50 miles from Atibaia 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:57.200
 the tide is like listening to you 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.370
 first video to get an idea of ​​the 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.450
 consumption 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.550
 so I 'm stopping at the post here. 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:08.030
 the on-board computer of the 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:11.600
 car does not know if more is not is 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.970
 showing up that's what I'm 38 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:19.250
 kilometers to rotate 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:22.190
 maybe it would be the 10 and 15 km to get out 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.989
 to run until you actually finish the 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.269
 tank gasoline, right? 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:28.220
 and here on the night panel people do not give 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:31.519
 to see even more 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:36.800
 that's what I rode with the car but that 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:40.190
 mixing in there city road is road 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:42.019
 with the foot a little more going rolling 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.750
 a little bit in the city, finally a consumption 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:48.290
 average together a little of everything not only in 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:51.230
 road but there are 514 kilometers 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:54.230
 it has to run here today that 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.420
 if only in hitting the road I think 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.970
 600 km house is there 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.519
 15 kilometers with 70 liters of 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:03.350
 Shooting a fuel some of 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.940
 city a little road a little 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:08.000
 road even faster 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:10.600
 then there is the information for those who have 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:16.720
 the best you have the curiosity to know 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:18.610
 I'll tell you now, there it is, look, it was 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.850
 a good night and a hug to all 

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:20.850
 bathrooms
