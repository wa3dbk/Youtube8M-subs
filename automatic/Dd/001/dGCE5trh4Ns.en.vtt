00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:24.759 
the future too this gives the board a

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:27.960 
the future too this gives the board a
slightly<00:00:25.269> longer<00:00:25.599> nose<00:00:26.039> then<00:00:27.039> tail<00:00:27.339> the

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.910 
back for its flex and the insert pattern
this<00:00:34.210> is<00:00:34.390> done<00:00:34.600> because<00:00:34.809> a<00:00:34.960> lot<00:00:35.199> of<00:00:35.230> people<00:00:35.680> are

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
this is done because a lot of people are

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.650 
this is done because a lot of people are
going<00:00:36.070> to<00:00:36.160> ride<00:00:36.309> primarily<00:00:36.879> in<00:00:37.180> one<00:00:37.449> direction

when you know their regular stance

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.279
