00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
don't think it's a particularly

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.259 
don't think it's a particularly
charismatic<00:03:05.100> actor<00:03:05.459> or<00:03:05.579> very<00:03:05.760> good<00:03:05.820> actor<00:03:06.239> and

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
charismatic actor or very good actor and

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.539 
charismatic actor or very good actor and
I<00:03:06.420> think<00:03:06.630> Burt<00:03:06.810> Reynolds<00:03:07.230> is<00:03:07.620> even<00:03:08.010> worse<00:03:08.250> and

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
I think Burt Reynolds is even worse and

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.190 
I think Burt Reynolds is even worse and
I<00:03:08.760> and<00:03:08.970> I<00:03:09.060> think<00:03:09.120> that<00:03:09.810> I<00:03:09.840> was<00:03:10.049> really

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
I and I think that I was really

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.479 
I and I think that I was really
surprised<00:03:10.769> because<00:03:10.920> I<00:03:11.100> didn't<00:03:11.280> feel<00:03:11.400> that

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
surprised because I didn't feel that

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.280 
surprised because I didn't feel that
there<00:03:11.610> was<00:03:11.700> any<00:03:11.970> chemistry<00:03:12.570> between<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:13.079> two

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
there was any chemistry between the two

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.140 
there was any chemistry between the two
I<00:03:13.530> thought<00:03:13.769> Reynolds<00:03:14.190> was<00:03:14.340> sort<00:03:14.549> of<00:03:14.610> hard<00:03:14.880> the

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
I thought Reynolds was sort of hard the

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.759 
I thought Reynolds was sort of hard the
kid<00:03:15.390> was<00:03:15.630> sort<00:03:16.110> of<00:03:16.140> looking<00:03:16.350> you<00:03:16.470> could<00:03:16.590> seem
