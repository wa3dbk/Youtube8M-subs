00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:13.679
 pc game is very difficult to make it first 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.780
 just wanted to prove to ourselves that we 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.109
 we can play with such teams by 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:22.320
 at least at home to score points and what 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.500
 there is nothing wrong with these commands I 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.359
 I think we proved it 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:30.000
 confident and fuels celtic 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.180
 virtually no it yet to do here 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.120
 such though all the strongest players played 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.809
 I do not know how to happen reciprocal meeting 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.180
 all may be different but the main 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.450
 the result is that we can play where 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.460
 at least at home to score points and we 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.079
 we will not be a team that will 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.899
 give away to everyone I think that's all 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:57.210
 extra of our teams apart 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.989
 They believe that a better chance still have 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.039
 links 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.589
 because we don't know how hard it is 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:08.060
 and play is simple and 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:11.490
 and even now winning 20 births at home 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:14.010
 Links are cast by a more experienced team. 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.380
 more of a master of sight and therefore chances are 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.479
 they are no longer anyway we have them 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.600
 just became a little bit more than it was 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.600
 before 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:31.150
 they are their part 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:36.300
 and we are very well developed knew din 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:39.730
 no one cut anyone at home 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:42.700
 you can mean anything 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:45.150
 we were preparing for this game hotel 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.990
 strengthens organized disciplined 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:49.810
 show first 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.030
 command god we know that only by this 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:56.320
 we can resist such teams 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:02:00.400
 excel and we did everything we planned in 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:03.280
 this logic us scored hizhichenko can 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:07.150
 it was assumed that we win the night 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:10.060
 what will get known was not we saw 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.460
 that there they were rebuilt released 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:16.300
 tall soccer player hanging 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:18.610
 started what we could win 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:24.010
 suggest but wanted to win not 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:26.700
 missed claiming the season 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.350
 with this standard home preform 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.550
 you, but it's the principle of 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:35.940
 element of some sort of randomness fragments 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.940
 it happens too 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.760
 for spheres with any without 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:57.560
 she's a recipe you don't need to just drop everything 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:03:02.540
 No, and I do not think so simply 0 or not 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:04.000
 kafka 100 episodes you saw better there 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:09.320
 somewhere need 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.510
 flat ground opponent and there is more 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.630
 just won the fight and 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.840
 for the nose got it all came together course i 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:21.410
 said that if there is a full stadium at 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:24.560
 us the chances of winning increases as 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:27.020
 at least twice the stadium came big 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.490
 thanks to all the fans to us us 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:30.490
 who helped us in her 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:45.200
 personal care was not this all people 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:47.800
 whether we do not play with personalized auriel 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:51.520
 music be a sound source crying over this 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:54.440
 I want to point out that there was a shortage 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.930
 gathered here all and so we missed 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.700
 quite early goal and that is the first goal 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.010
 was missed when we are very strong 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:04.490
 they were preparing skype game and as I said 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:06.230
 we we created and low chances he them not 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:10.630
 realized this of course of course 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.630
 we are unhappy
