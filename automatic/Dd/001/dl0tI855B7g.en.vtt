a<00:00:29.619> good<00:00:30.619> idea<00:00:31.040> maybe<00:00:31.279> because<00:00:31.640> rent<00:00:31.820> one<00:00:31.970> heavy

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:32.210 
a good idea maybe because rent one heavy

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.000 
a good idea maybe because rent one heavy
way<00:00:32.419> in<00:00:32.599> one<00:00:32.750> lightweight<00:00:33.200> normally<00:00:33.920> the

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
way in one lightweight normally the

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.350 
way in one lightweight normally the
heavyweights<00:00:34.400> have<00:00:34.489> a<00:00:34.610> very<00:00:34.820> heavy<00:00:35.000> steering

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
heavyweights have a very heavy steering

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.240 
heavyweights have a very heavy steering
I<00:00:35.780> did<00:00:36.170> find<00:00:36.410> that<00:00:36.470> with<00:00:36.650> Donkey<00:00:36.890> Kong<00:00:37.040> on<00:00:37.070> the

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
I did find that with Donkey Kong on the

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.280 
I did find that with Donkey Kong on the
first<00:00:37.489> track<00:00:37.790> the<00:00:38.330> corners<00:00:38.690> were<00:00:38.809> fine<00:00:39.080> for

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
first track the corners were fine for

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:40.720 
first track the corners were fine for
him<00:00:39.320> and<00:00:39.559> I<00:00:39.620> was<00:00:39.710> able<00:00:39.830> to<00:00:40.010> speed<00:00:40.280> ahead<00:00:40.400> and<00:00:40.700> I

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
him and I was able to speed ahead and I

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.580 
him and I was able to speed ahead and I
won<00:00:40.879> the<00:00:41.000> race<00:00:41.120> but<00:00:41.780> where<00:00:41.900> we<00:00:41.960> got<00:00:42.080> the<00:00:42.230> second

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:42.590 
won the race but where we got the second

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.229 
won the race but where we got the second
third<00:00:42.800> race<00:00:43.010> Leila<00:00:43.580> brought<00:00:43.730> the<00:00:43.820> wednesday

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
third race Leila brought the wednesday

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:45.820 
third race Leila brought the wednesday
and<00:00:44.390> i<00:00:44.420> think<00:00:44.629> maybe<00:00:44.780> yoshi<00:00:45.110> stairs<00:00:45.559> better

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:45.830 
and i think maybe yoshi stairs better

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.049 
and i think maybe yoshi stairs better
some<00:00:46.070> around<00:00:46.309> some<00:00:46.489> of<00:00:46.580> those<00:00:46.670> sharper

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
some around some of those sharper

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:48.970 
some around some of those sharper
corners<00:00:47.210> so<00:00:48.050> I<00:00:48.080> think<00:00:48.170> again<00:00:48.590> it's<00:00:48.769> going<00:00:48.920> to

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
corners so I think again it's going to

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.110 
corners so I think again it's going to
be<00:00:49.040> quite<00:00:49.160> good<00:00:49.460> to<00:00:49.580> experiment<00:00:50.090> with

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
be quite good to experiment with

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.750 
be quite good to experiment with
different<00:00:50.300> cards<00:00:50.780> and<00:00:51.050> see<00:00:51.170> how<00:00:51.320> I<00:00:51.350> can<00:00:51.500> win

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
different cards and see how I can win

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.650 
different cards and see how I can win
but<00:00:52.760> lately<00:00:52.940> i'll<00:00:53.030> probably<00:00:53.180> tell<00:00:53.420> you<00:00:53.480> a<00:00:53.540> bit

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
but lately i'll probably tell you a bit

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.420 
but lately i'll probably tell you a bit
more<00:00:53.690> about<00:00:53.930> yo<00:00:54.140> she's<00:00:54.350> steering<00:00:54.590> up<00:00:54.949> went<00:00:55.220> for

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
more about yo she's steering up went for

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.830 
more about yo she's steering up went for
the<00:00:55.519> second<00:00:55.820> and<00:00:55.910> third<00:00:55.940> race<00:00:56.300> where<00:00:56.570> she<00:00:56.720> got

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
the second and third race where she got

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.640 
the second and third race where she got
victories<00:00:57.320> yeah<00:00:57.949> she<00:00:58.460> steering<00:00:58.910> is<00:00:59.030> very<00:00:59.059> easy

00:00:59.640 --> 00:00:59.650 
victories yeah she steering is very easy

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.530 
victories yeah she steering is very easy
it<00:01:00.650> was<00:01:00.799> nice<00:01:00.949> to<00:01:01.220> have<00:01:01.339> a<00:01:01.370> different<00:01:01.610> changes

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:02.540 
it was nice to have a different changes

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:04.180 
it was nice to have a different changes
when<00:01:02.750> I<00:01:02.780> play<00:01:02.989> super<00:01:03.409> apart<00:01:03.769> I'm<00:01:03.920> used<00:01:04.129> to

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
when I play super apart I'm used to

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.219 
when I play super apart I'm used to
playing<00:01:04.339> heavy<00:01:04.640> weights<00:01:04.879> and<00:01:05.810> it<00:01:05.900> was<00:01:05.990> good<00:01:06.140> to

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
playing heavy weights and it was good to

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.770 
playing heavy weights and it was good to
play<00:01:06.320> Yoshi<00:01:06.650> because<00:01:07.100> it<00:01:07.220> felt<00:01:07.490> like<00:01:08.390> the

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
play Yoshi because it felt like the

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.990 
play Yoshi because it felt like the
turning<00:01:09.020> was<00:01:09.500> different<00:01:09.979> but<00:01:10.370> it<00:01:10.430> felt<00:01:10.820> a<00:01:10.909> lot

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
turning was different but it felt a lot

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.850 
turning was different but it felt a lot
easier<00:01:11.210> lot<00:01:11.630> smoother<00:01:12.110> and<00:01:12.409> I<00:01:12.470> think<00:01:12.710> maybe

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
easier lot smoother and I think maybe

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.560 
easier lot smoother and I think maybe
that's<00:01:13.130> where<00:01:13.340> sigh<00:01:13.760> maxaad<00:01:14.090> went<00:01:14.330> wrong

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
that's where sigh maxaad went wrong

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:15.880 
that's where sigh maxaad went wrong
maybe<00:01:14.990> because<00:01:15.080> he<00:01:15.229> wasn't<00:01:15.409> used<00:01:15.680> to<00:01:15.830> the

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
maybe because he wasn't used to the

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.950 
maybe because he wasn't used to the
chart<00:01:16.790> of<00:01:16.970> the<00:01:17.060> game<00:01:17.240> he<00:01:17.479> maybe<00:01:17.659> should<00:01:17.930> have

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
chart of the game he maybe should have

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.230 
chart of the game he maybe should have
tried<00:01:18.250> something<00:01:19.250> else<00:01:19.340> but<00:01:19.729> I<00:01:19.940> was<00:01:20.119> happy

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
tried something else but I was happy

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.910 
tried something else but I was happy
with<00:01:20.479> how<00:01:20.630> it<00:01:20.720> went<00:01:20.869> cuz<00:01:21.200> I<00:01:21.320> beat<00:01:21.350> him<00:01:21.710> and

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
with how it went cuz I beat him and

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.399 
with how it went cuz I beat him and
that's<00:01:21.950> always<00:01:22.220> good<00:01:22.460> so<00:01:22.930> that's<00:01:23.930> good<00:01:24.170> we<00:01:24.260> use

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
that's always good so that's good we use

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.020 
that's always good so that's good we use
the<00:01:24.619> heavyweights<00:01:25.070> in<00:01:25.250> the<00:01:25.369> original<00:01:25.490> snows

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
the heavyweights in the original snows

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.460 
the heavyweights in the original snows
game<00:01:26.299> because<00:01:26.600> they<00:01:26.720> have<00:01:26.810> the<00:01:26.900> fastest<00:01:27.290> top

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
game because they have the fastest top

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.109 
game because they have the fastest top
speed<00:01:27.770> so<00:01:27.950> I<00:01:28.010> always<00:01:28.130> like<00:01:28.460> to<00:01:28.490> try<00:01:28.790> them<00:01:29.030> in

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
speed so I always like to try them in

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:30.370 
speed so I always like to try them in
the<00:01:29.210> new<00:01:29.330> games<00:01:29.600> and<00:01:29.840> I<00:01:29.930> think<00:01:30.140> that<00:01:30.260> heavy

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
the new games and I think that heavy

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.560 
the new games and I think that heavy
weights<00:01:30.650> are<00:01:30.799> quite<00:01:30.979> good<00:01:31.010> in<00:01:31.250> America<00:01:31.310> we<00:01:31.880> so

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
weights are quite good in America we so

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.510 
weights are quite good in America we so
after<00:01:32.990> some<00:01:33.140> experimentation<00:01:33.260> we'll<00:01:34.190> see<00:01:34.370> who

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
after some experimentation we'll see who

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.190 
after some experimentation we'll see who
the<00:01:34.610> best<00:01:34.790> characters<00:01:35.270> are<00:01:35.450> in<00:01:35.630> each<00:01:35.750> track<00:01:36.050> in

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
the best characters are in each track in

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.500 
the best characters are in each track in
Mario<00:01:36.500> Kart<00:01:36.530> 8<00:01:36.920> basically<00:01:37.910> the<00:01:38.030> first<00:01:38.210> thing

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
Mario Kart 8 basically the first thing

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.240 
Mario Kart 8 basically the first thing
that<00:01:38.720> I<00:01:38.750> think<00:01:39.050> took<00:01:39.200> me<00:01:39.440> really<00:01:39.620> well<00:01:39.890> was<00:01:40.130> the

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
that I think took me really well was the

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.310 
that I think took me really well was the
graphics<00:01:40.670> the<00:01:41.240> controls<00:01:41.690> obviously<00:01:42.170> were

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
graphics the controls obviously were

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.290 
graphics the controls obviously were
yeah<00:01:42.800> every<00:01:43.130> new<00:01:43.280> mario<00:01:43.580> kart<00:01:43.850> game<00:01:44.000> is<00:01:44.150> very

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
yeah every new mario kart game is very

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.850 
yeah every new mario kart game is very
different<00:01:44.570> with<00:01:44.750> the<00:01:44.840> control<00:01:45.170> side<00:01:45.410> did<00:01:45.650> take

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
different with the control side did take

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.980 
different with the control side did take
a<00:01:45.890> little<00:01:46.130> while<00:01:46.370> to<00:01:46.550> get<00:01:46.670> into<00:01:46.970> I<00:01:47.270> think<00:01:47.840> that

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
a little while to get into I think that

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.330 
a little while to get into I think that
every<00:01:48.230> character<00:01:48.620> has<00:01:48.650> different<00:01:49.100> driving

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
every character has different driving

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.100 
every character has different driving
stats<00:01:49.760> and<00:01:50.000> that<00:01:50.150> will<00:01:50.330> play<00:01:50.570> well<00:01:50.810> on<00:01:50.840> how

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
stats and that will play well on how

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.100 
stats and that will play well on how
well<00:01:51.320> you<00:01:51.350> do<00:01:51.560> in<00:01:51.590> each

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
well you do in each

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.170 
well you do in each
otherwise<00:01:53.010> graphically<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.790> I<00:01:53.880> think<00:01:54.090> the

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
otherwise graphically and I think the

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.430 
otherwise graphically and I think the
redesigned<00:01:54.720> we've<00:01:54.900> having<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.260> old

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
redesigned we've having the old

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.740 
redesigned we've having the old
magnetism<00:01:56.190> and<00:01:56.550> going<00:01:56.850> around<00:01:56.940> loop<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.570> loop

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
magnetism and going around loop the loop

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.290 
magnetism and going around loop the loop
with<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.110> quarter<00:01:58.500> that's<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.830> very<00:01:59.040> good<00:01:59.130> idea

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
with the quarter that's a very good idea

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.480 
with the quarter that's a very good idea
so<00:02:00.410> yeah<00:02:01.410> there's<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.650> lot<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.890> explore<00:02:02.250> in<00:02:02.400> the

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
so yeah there's a lot to explore in the

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.070 
so yeah there's a lot to explore in the
game<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:02.970> I<00:02:03.390> think<00:02:03.570> it's<00:02:03.690> a<00:02:03.720> good<00:02:03.840> combination

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:04.080 
game and I think it's a good combination

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.040 
game and I think it's a good combination
of<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.680> previous<00:02:05.070> version<00:02:05.460> so<00:02:05.700> far<00:02:05.970> so<00:02:06.930> what

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
of the previous version so far so what

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.900 
of the previous version so far so what
did<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.260> think<00:02:07.320> I<00:02:07.710> thought<00:02:08.520> it's<00:02:08.700> really

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
did you think I thought it's really

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.969 
did you think I thought it's really
fantastic<00:02:09.090> how<00:02:09.840> all<00:02:09.990> the<00:02:10.110> graphics<00:02:10.320> or<00:02:10.770> so

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
fantastic how all the graphics or so

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.940 
fantastic how all the graphics or so
they<00:02:11.820> were<00:02:11.880> just<00:02:12.060> so<00:02:12.300> like<00:02:13.020> Chris<00:02:13.440> when<00:02:13.770> you

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
they were just so like Chris when you

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.650 
they were just so like Chris when you
could<00:02:14.160> just<00:02:14.190> see<00:02:14.760> it<00:02:14.970> was<00:02:15.120> likely<00:02:15.330> to<00:02:15.360> see

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
could just see it was likely to see

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.930 
could just see it was likely to see
everything<00:02:16.230> in<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.620> background<00:02:17.580> of<00:02:17.820> the

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
everything in the background of the

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.270 
everything in the background of the
tracks<00:02:18.240> and<00:02:18.720> it's<00:02:18.870> it's<00:02:19.290> a<00:02:19.380> really<00:02:19.560> nice<00:02:19.740> sort

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
tracks and it's it's a really nice sort

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.770 
tracks and it's it's a really nice sort
of<00:02:20.310> games<00:02:20.580> you<00:02:20.730> can<00:02:20.970> play<00:02:21.000> with<00:02:21.180> your<00:02:21.300> family

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
of games you can play with your family

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.630 
of games you can play with your family
and<00:02:21.840> it's<00:02:22.020> lighting<00:02:22.290> new<00:02:22.440> for<00:02:22.680> everyone<00:02:23.070> with

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
and it's lighting new for everyone with

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.130 
and it's lighting new for everyone with
the<00:02:23.760> gravity<00:02:23.940> and<00:02:24.450> everything<00:02:24.780> so<00:02:24.900> I<00:02:24.959> think

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
the gravity and everything so I think

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.690 
the gravity and everything so I think
it's<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.320> really<00:02:25.440> nice<00:02:25.590> addition<00:02:26.070> to<00:02:26.100> it<00:02:28.700> guys

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700

the rainbow road which having keep going
on<00:02:50.700> for<00:02:50.850> all<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.060> newer<00:02:51.239> versions<00:02:51.750> so<00:02:52.380> I

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
on for all the newer versions so I

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.810 
on for all the newer versions so I
better<00:02:52.620> go<00:02:52.800> on<00:02:52.920> a<00:02:52.950> couple<00:02:53.250> of<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.400> new<00:02:53.520> tracks

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
better go on a couple of the new tracks

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.180 
better go on a couple of the new tracks
America<00:02:54.420> and<00:02:55.260> I've<00:02:55.350> been<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.590> designs<00:02:55.980> are

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
America and I've been the designs are

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:57.440 
America and I've been the designs are
just<00:02:56.370> getting<00:02:56.549> better<00:02:56.670> and<00:02:56.880> better<00:02:57.090> more

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
just getting better and better more

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
interesting as well with a new go sales

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.310 
interesting as well with a new go sales
track<00:03:00.060> where<00:03:00.269> you<00:03:00.360> go<00:03:00.480> all<00:03:00.660> upside<00:03:01.080> down

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
track where you go all upside down

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.720 
track where you go all upside down
everything<00:03:01.799> in<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:01.980> track<00:03:02.190> and<00:03:02.400> at<00:03:02.459> the<00:03:02.580> end

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
everything in the track and at the end

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.100 
everything in the track and at the end
this<00:03:02.880> special<00:03:03.269> thing<00:03:03.480> we<00:03:03.630> don't<00:03:03.810> know<00:03:03.900> what

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
this special thing we don't know what

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:05.270 
this special thing we don't know what
angle<00:03:04.410> you're<00:03:04.470> going<00:03:04.650> to<00:03:04.709> come<00:03:04.860> out<00:03:04.890> you<00:03:05.190> have

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
angle you're going to come out you have

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.190 
angle you're going to come out you have
to<00:03:05.370> come<00:03:05.549> out<00:03:05.580> sideways<00:03:05.940> so<00:03:06.810> putting<00:03:07.019> these

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
to come out sideways so putting these

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.810 
to come out sideways so putting these
things<00:03:07.470> into<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.830> design<00:03:08.160> I<00:03:08.190> think<00:03:08.370> I'm<00:03:08.610> very

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
things into the design I think I'm very

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:11.060 
things into the design I think I'm very
thoughtful<00:03:09.330> I<00:03:09.540> think<00:03:10.170> the<00:03:10.290> controls<00:03:10.680> for<00:03:10.799> us

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
thoughtful I think the controls for us

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.039 
thoughtful I think the controls for us
obviously<00:03:11.250> very<00:03:12.060> difficult<00:03:12.450> to<00:03:12.570> reuse<00:03:12.870> to<00:03:12.959> the

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
obviously very difficult to reuse to the

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.080 
obviously very difficult to reuse to the
original<00:03:13.350> version<00:03:13.530> where<00:03:13.980> you<00:03:14.040> can<00:03:14.190> do<00:03:14.370> break

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
original version where you can do break

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.060 
original version where you can do break
fine<00:03:15.360> jumping<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:16.049> steering<00:03:16.620> right<00:03:16.830> by<00:03:17.010> the

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
fine jumping and steering right by the

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.740 
fine jumping and steering right by the
edge<00:03:17.280> of<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:17.489> road<00:03:17.670> jumping<00:03:18.090> over<00:03:18.330> gaps<00:03:18.510> and

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
edge of the road jumping over gaps and

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.360 
edge of the road jumping over gaps and
things<00:03:18.930> which<00:03:19.080> is<00:03:19.110> what<00:03:19.320> we<00:03:19.410> used<00:03:19.590> to<00:03:19.709> so<00:03:20.340> it's

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
things which is what we used to so it's

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.699 
things which is what we used to so it's
a<00:03:20.489> very<00:03:20.519> very<00:03:21.000> different<00:03:21.180> style<00:03:21.630> but<00:03:21.959> I<00:03:22.200> think

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
a very very different style but I think

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:24.500 
a very very different style but I think
every<00:03:22.980> gamer<00:03:23.220> has<00:03:23.519> their<00:03:23.700> own<00:03:23.730> kind<00:03:24.090> of<00:03:24.239> smile

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
every gamer has their own kind of smile

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.509 
every gamer has their own kind of smile
in<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:24.840> game<00:03:25.019> and<00:03:25.290> then<00:03:25.799> that's<00:03:26.100> whichever

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
in the game and then that's whichever

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.400 
in the game and then that's whichever
game<00:03:26.730> is<00:03:26.880> best<00:03:27.090> for<00:03:27.299> them<00:03:27.510> I<00:03:27.750> think<00:03:28.260> it's

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
game is best for them I think it's

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.380 
game is best for them I think it's
graphically<00:03:29.010> amazing

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
graphically amazing

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.200 
graphically amazing
sort<00:03:30.660> of<00:03:30.720> say<00:03:30.870> about<00:03:31.110> it<00:03:31.290> is<00:03:31.770> free<00:03:32.210> really

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:33.210 
sort of say about it is free really

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.120 
sort of say about it is free really
really<00:03:33.450> good<00:03:33.630> yeah<00:03:34.440> other<00:03:34.590> than<00:03:34.620> the<00:03:34.770> graphics

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
really good yeah other than the graphics

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.650 
really good yeah other than the graphics
really<00:03:35.430> like<00:03:35.610> took<00:03:35.970> us<00:03:36.090> this<00:03:36.240> time<00:03:36.450> the

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
really like took us this time the

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.340 
really like took us this time the
changes<00:03:37.050> and<00:03:37.080> the<00:03:37.290> design<00:03:37.830> of<00:03:37.860> the<00:03:38.100> tracks
