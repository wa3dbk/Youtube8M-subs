00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.959
 well that's it everyone yves 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.629
 youth and today we suffer for a 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:10.469
 new video at the request of someone 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:13.290
 I can tell you his name since everything 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.130
 I just do not feel like you 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.970
 can call it marie-laure for example 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.949
 I'm going to call him marie-laure 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.320
 any case and he will recognize himself for this 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.910
 name I'm doing a video so on the 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.939
 labyrinth that we have come a long way 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.429
 so he's the one who asked me to 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.369
 deal since I had made a before 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:36.480
 but I'm doing one to show how 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.550
 so it's moving forward there for example there is 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.649
 the entrance behind has not finished we have 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.790
 still ends up corridors but where 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.530
 we are the most concentrated for the moment 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.750
 it's the structure inside 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:50.550
 So you see we have already added 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:52.949
 relief milk well you see there we have 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.300
 added for example see a block of 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.670
 command that exceeds the water but that 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.910
 is it in mascon fly by europe so 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.890
 watched up 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.920
 the doors close that mark the 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.820
 doors are closing it's great I love 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.240
 and so obviously all doors 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.260
 are closed 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.260
 that you will know surely this is the 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.320
 refuge for the door between watching the 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.810
 bad mass inside 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.790
 it is the refuge of the runners that we did not 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.070
 not yet finished or where in the middle it 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.920
 there is a whole map 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.450
 So we did what two or three things 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.290
 what we did for other purposes added 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.930
 more relief 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.840
 I speak at the level of buildings the only 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.039
 to a friend we made the tree quickly 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.830
 but will make more advance the forest 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:39.420
 since it's more towards the end that we 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.149
 advance the sacred forest no tree 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.649
 because there it is a bit too far they 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:45.780
 could after other jean buildings 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.179
 the the main place the aragon room 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.539
 added fars deschamps has already done one here 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:55.280
 and lots of other stuff like 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:57.270
 it always speaks to join us 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.929
 would already have a lot to build 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.659
 so that's cool r thank you 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:08.670
 similarly skype hop I quickly 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:11.750
 take the sign back into the 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:17.600
 tea view with intel tiny dots 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:19.440
 youtube christened youtube to join 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.090
 you say it's to build 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.000
 labyrinth and that's it I do not accept 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.410
 direct map will be download 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.769
 obviously once completed otherwise it's 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.610
 a little phony it really has nothing if not 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:32.760

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.560

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.750
 I hesitate, I think I do not do it 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.310
 what I'm going to do is that I 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:37.020
 will turn a video from time to time 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.730
 to show what it starts in advance 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:42.180

 maybe not made a target it's a 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.980
