 what has been this gameplay and for 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.949
 I asked for this information as I want 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.260
 they will be watching the gameplay in the background and 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:45.239
 as much as the tweet that you send 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.019
 to this good information I asked for 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.940
 you good as you will be seeing in the 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:52.730
 gameplay background is putting what 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.100
 comes being horses is pretty much 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.989
 something in quotes equal to what comes 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.960
 being the previous video that I uploaded 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:05.470
 but in this video I liked it much more 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:08.620
 because it comes more let's say that species of 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.990
 then in epc that or monkeys or monkeys 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.330
 game that did not come in the previous video 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.990
 such are what are the 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:21.730
 bats and what are these witches 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.930
 not good these people will also be 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.910
 watching what is being a gameplay 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.280
 in what has been the little piece in the 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.570
 pebble is this update of 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.950
 once I repeat so that we do not have to 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.710
 compose in the comments will come out 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.410
 for all consoles it will be no no 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.960
 is going to be this exception of neither one is going to 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.490
 go out for all the consoles and good a 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.260
 very important point that I want to take in 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.910
 this part of the video is that they are going to take 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.020
 adventure mode of adventure mode what 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.479
 they are going to take this one out 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.859
 let's say that relatively I think that 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:51.350
 I also know that in hardcore mode but 

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:53.590
 well it depends a lot on them but 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.420
 the adventure mode is already confirmed 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.700
 well there are as you will be seeing in the 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.500
 video is in another shot they are playing as 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.810
 I tell them in the psvita foot right now they are going to 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.759
 put what is being witches there 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.700
 As you can see there is a witch and I think that 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:10.340
 put and well now will be looking for what 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.200
 what is the bat and right now 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.440
 he puts it but good people this is what 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.599
 it's been the gameplay I hope that they 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.640

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:21.470
