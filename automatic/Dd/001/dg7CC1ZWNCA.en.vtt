you're actually just going to need to go
back<00:01:47.280> into<00:01:47.579> clockworkmod<00:01:48.270> so<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:49.530> do<00:01:49.680> so<00:01:49.950> if

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
back into clockworkmod so to do so if

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.069 
back into clockworkmod so to do so if
you<00:01:50.520> have<00:01:50.729> clockworkmod<00:01:51.270> five<00:01:51.810> point<00:01:52.020> zero

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
you have clockworkmod five point zero

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.450 
you have clockworkmod five point zero
point<00:01:52.380> two<00:01:52.439> point<00:01:52.649> seven<00:01:52.860> it's<00:01:53.100> go<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.280> rom

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
point two point seven it's go to rom

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
gives a loading screen just like this so

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.009 
gives a loading screen just like this so
don't<00:02:16.489> be<00:02:16.670> don't<00:02:17.120> worry<00:02:17.329> if<00:02:17.510> it<00:02:17.659> gives<00:02:17.810> you

don't be don't worry if it gives you
this<00:02:18.230> and<00:02:18.530> then<00:02:18.650> it<00:02:18.769> should<00:02:18.920> go<00:02:19.069> in<00:02:19.099> the
