00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.670

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.729
 Help since 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.409
 Let's assume you are on one 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.840
 festival hurts you on one 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.329

 the link to the product break player index 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:39.439
 falls under the video clicks on it 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.460

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:43.159

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:48.530

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:51.619

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.030
 you once such a carry handle who 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.929

 yes there comes a belt through 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:05.810
 I also think a bit narrow 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:09.069
 The belt should not be too wide 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:12.680
 and then we have to stop here above the 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:15.200
 zipper and there it could be 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.560
 It's great to open up and have a look 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:22.360

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:28.190

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:35.310

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:42.330

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.330

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:48.110

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:03.840
