 You can take beef in general, then here we are 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.619
 which you like most importantly you 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.960
 there must be shit onions as much as 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:23.010
 meat is a lot of onion today I will 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.289
 do with meat and cheese I take is the goal 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:30.179
 my love is somehow starting now with 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:32.610
 you make our our dough for me 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.870
 need flour ordinary butter 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:41.160
 vegetable and we will need here yet 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:43.140
 boiling water make dough I make white flour 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:48.210
 I donâ€™t know how to say it 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:50.399
 I make a dimple inside and salt the flour that is 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:56.430
 it's more like I salt nothing 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:58.020
 I will be salted inside here I pour 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.590
 butter 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:06.120
 so I added oil here to the center of 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:11.310
 calculating half a kilo of flour half a glass 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:15.870
 oils and so she often poured oil 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:18.660
 just salted here 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.270
 way and after I salted 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:27.150
 add here 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:32.040
 somewhere two tablespoons of vodka but u 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:36.540
 I'm out of alcohol now 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:39.780
 Vodka that I like and do not, we were binding you 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.560
 also not to say so after that we 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:50.430
 here add boiling water 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:54.149
 main region pour and now me 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.640
 it ended here is such a mixture and I 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.090
 take a fork because it is hot 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:05.690
 understand boiling water and start to say so 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:05.690
 knead the dough slowly but surely 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.230
 Now 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.769
 cook stuffing stuffing we are preparing what 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.989
 way we salt it that is on 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:27.629
 add black pepper to taste 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:31.170
 also add to taste that is like 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:34.049
 you like it and add it 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.959
 here is an ordinary glass of filtered water 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:39.150
 exactly as much as you have here 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.400
 minced meat should be the same for you and 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.099
 here and onions ie onions and add 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.139
 very very much our stuffing and it should 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.489
 get so know watery 

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:50.760
 inhale so he where accuracy is me 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:53.400
 half an hour stand and rest onion will give your 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.669
 the juice and in general, thus thereby fail 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:03.659
 very tasty juicy but also pasties and so 

00:02:56.669 --> 00:03:06.840
 set aside and so while my farish is resting 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:10.049
 I made the dough but it will work out too 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.540
 I rest on a tightrope cheese that is, I want 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:14.700
 do today like with meat so wait at 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:19.230
 I still love people and cheese so 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:22.669
 I make more cheese and cheese and protein on a small 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.669
 grating it 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.609
 so the dough should make us very 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:47.680
 very thin that is she is very 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:50.890
 elastic and very cake of ours 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:55.209
 It appears through and so rolled our 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:57.159
 dough and now I put our son here all 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.989
 then you can by the way all who visa green 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:01.540
 onion is also very tasty but I do 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.030
 such on chebureki with cheese and children 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:08.170
 so the bow does not get along 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:12.340
 just put zacharya all that good 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:16.299
 fasten the wick for beauty just a div and 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:20.220
 these are the edges of all our people 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:22.419
 Generally ready for further technical 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:26.759
 heat treatment more precisely in general already to 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:26.759
 frying and cooking already next 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:43.700
 and so turn on our stove with you 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.280
 maximum heat and pour 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:52.790
 a lot of oil that is to 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:55.220
 our man they swam there here i'm 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:57.740
 prepared a baking pan on the side and therefore 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.770
 metal mesh will be here first 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:04.280
 take off so they are on the glass with 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:06.500
 them oil and already further I have there 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.000
 prepare a plate where I will sleep 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:11.590
 already so to speak a finished product and 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.590
 ready what century
