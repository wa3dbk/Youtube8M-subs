00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:02.600
 hello I am in the lead 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.249
 I will say how you can easily create 

00:00:05.249 --> 00:00:07.760
 a kind of digital watch popovich 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.760
 with used cock cock plan 

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:13.579
 ooo first let's see the same 

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:15.369
 the result we have to get at the end 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:16.730
 this groundhog 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.730
 I will launch the finished project 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:23.969
 Here are about such a clock but we get by 

00:00:23.969 --> 00:00:25.739
 the end of this 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:27.529
 shutting down 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.529
 and now we are creating a new hangman project 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.670
 house 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:36.670
 that's komi 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.700
 here's a new project we have to create 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.800
 ruble preparation our future of hours 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.390
 in the survey such a blank will 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:45.460
 yield to economic 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.470
 text field 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.630
 so apparently the panel experiments 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:51.950
 select the text tool 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.260
 then arrival on the instrument text 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.550
 we carry the properties panel 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.340
 and here indicated that we need 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.580
 exactly dynamic text from quality 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.410
 quiet texts highlight dynamics x raiders 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.510
 text 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.850
 protective properties we can specify 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.490
 sheriff for our fatherhood field 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.030
 and text size 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.830
 light text 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.540
 bold text 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.150
 In addition, it is desirable to turn the text on 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.000
 the center of our text field 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.110
 another important setting which is not 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.360
 worth neglecting 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.720
 is to indicate that our 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.150
 the text box will be 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.220
 text is placed under the monster cube 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.690
 she is done with 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.770
 here is this sleek here we clean 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.180
 singles flame 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.050
 well built done 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.050
 if our texts have a field on the desktop 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.980
 have painted 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.840
 now highlighting our texts in the field 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.940
 and let's align 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.390
 centered on our desktop 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.650
 exceeded text box apparently 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:01.840
 panel 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:02.920
 alignment 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.380
 im level centered 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.139
 texts field profitable 

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:11.329
 receive selected text box 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:13.319
 we are going 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.409
 properties about the process 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:17.489
 and here it is 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:18.819
 more than a year 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.950
 what exactly those who to whom our texts field 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.529
 will be called a cop 

00:02:23.529 --> 00:02:26.529
 but there is a clock 

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:32.379
 OK 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:34.159
 preparatory will appear finished 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:35.059
 now we can 

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:37.209
 proceed to 1 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.209
 select the first frame of our porsche video 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.389
 then apparently the panel 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:45.389
 as a chance of action i discovered this 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:48.829
 smartly I leave the panels in advance 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:50.449
 harvested 

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:52.539
 which will go along with the lesson you 

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:55.459
 Omsk can be the first part of the figures 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.019
 to put 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:58.839
 Stalin 

00:02:58.839 --> 00:03:01.149
 the percentage of what's happening here is what are you 

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:02.620
 since the data works 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.839
 This is very easy to handle. 

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:07.979
 every time you go over new frames 

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:09.439
 your movie 

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:12.439
 before 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:14.890
 I'm in front of 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.949
 signed laying date 

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:21.159
 brother anna and un current time 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:22.679
 from minutes 

00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:24.769
 chasto and second 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.459
 and updates ours accordingly 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:27.400
 text field 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.890
 our text box text 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.349
 badly 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:34.139
 and what is the leaven date 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:37.529
 you have a date he is responsible for the work 

00:03:37.529 --> 00:03:40.969
 with time about the language of csk and vol 2 0 

00:03:40.969 --> 00:03:42.999
 he has a lot of methods 

00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:44.689
 but we will use 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:45.769
 only three 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:48.559
 using these methods 

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:50.589
 g he 

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:51.530
 him thousand 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.029
 moves end 

00:03:53.029 --> 00:03:55.849
 we will get accordingly 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:57.779
 current time in hours 

00:03:57.779 --> 00:03:58.760
 well, like this 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.089
 not at all 

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:04.059
 so we will have 

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:05.949
 three changes 

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:07.370
 which will store 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:08.559
 current time 

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:09.799
 for hours 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:10.730
 variable h 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.530
 the current time is the minute it is them current 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.530
 time per second 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.090
 because of these changes we gig of the ends 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.750
 build 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.800
 here is such a string 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.309
 here less 

00:04:26.309 --> 00:04:27.919
 current time 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:30.360
 in the clock we add Stepushchenko Ilyin 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.080
 minute there is still time second 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.219
 and get the string 

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:38.219
 assign our text to the field 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.180
 except for the beauty of drake 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.430
 so on terms 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.499
 But the conditions are necessary and if they 

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:50.059
 full of sport to form such 

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:51.620
 the situation is that 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.069
 eg 

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:54.830
 variable and h 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.719
 but today is the Diet 

00:04:57.719 --> 00:05:00.000
 digital clock rules are displayed 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.409
 two characters per clock nominees per second 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:06.409
 but if for example now 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:09.159
 9 two things nine o'clock then 

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:10.900
 accordingly everything will be 1 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.220
 And to the birds, the field of butyrkah looks 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.069
 ugly so we will 

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:16.469
 pereslavl 

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:19.169
 which relieves the recession 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:21.749
 here's a peculiar 

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:23.110
 ugliness 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.849
 mean hours 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:27.330
 Here we reviewed 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.169
 I tried to run 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:31.020
 close the police 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.979
 to check the work found the code we 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:34.460
 must press 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.389
 keyboard shortcut kontrol cantor which launch 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:40.389
 what man folk rock n 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:42.479
 launched 

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:43.839
 as we see 

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:45.389
 video clip 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:47.749
 watch show approx 

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:51.069
 I'll tell you right away that this is a bonus 

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:52.550
 unreal 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.710
 this time is what the past takes 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:56.680
 from the hall 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:57.969
 found and under 

00:05:57.969 --> 00:05:59.379
 our computer 

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:02.680
 and accordingly the computer does 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.900
 4 Gazprom in different ways to apply ransom smog 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.089
 right 

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:10.089
 but that is how it works to calculate 

00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:12.650
 closing glasses 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:15.460
 but for beauty we can also do a lot 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.509
 our text box 

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:19.099
 and edit filters 

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:21.400
 so the plot texts n 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.610
 the word genocide in the field 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.610
 and apparently boards of 15 

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:28.620
 we have here 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:30.889
 for example in case of fire to our text 

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:32.979
 field here with 

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:34.580
 what is stopping 

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:38.020
 filter panasova called 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.099

00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:41.830
 subject 

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:44.830
 but almost colors will choose nothing else 

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:48.979
 gray color 

00:06:52.399 --> 00:06:53.369
 tick 

00:06:53.369 --> 00:06:55.189
 put here 

00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:57.740
 the area that he is crowded 

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.820
 run reads using 4 pack bad 

00:07:01.659 --> 00:07:02.830
 but it turned out pretty nice 

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:04.210
 true 

00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:05.550
 cyclone 

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.029
 therefore we hide 

00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:10.029
 returning back buy buy torso 

00:07:11.949 --> 00:07:14.360
 got used to a different text field just for close 

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.110
 for happiness bribe turkey see that 

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:16.949
 here we have 

00:07:16.949 --> 00:07:18.439
 is specified 

00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:21.439
 GMO filter 

00:07:22.169 --> 00:07:23.090

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.620
 parents setting this type 

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:30.499
 let's decree what color submission 

00:07:30.499 --> 00:07:33.279
 indicated with there the children account again 

00:07:33.279 --> 00:07:34.250
 launch our 

00:07:34.250 --> 00:07:37.180
 at the seams 

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.310
 Well, our watches are even more harmful 

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:40.580
 original 

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:42.310
 but basically you can play around with 

00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:44.460
 add filters 

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:45.479
 some 

00:07:45.479 --> 00:07:47.899
 new effect new filters 

00:07:47.899 --> 00:07:50.429
 play around with honoring filters 

00:07:50.429 --> 00:07:52.099
 I see there from get very even 

00:07:52.099 --> 00:07:53.139
 regions 

00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:55.439
 but on this, I probably agree this 

00:07:55.439 --> 00:07:56.719
 dialogue 

00:07:56.719 --> 00:07:57.110
 goodbye
