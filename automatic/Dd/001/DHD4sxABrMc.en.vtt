for my adept rate I run area attacks
with<00:00:56.460> staff<00:00:56.670> larger<00:00:57.180> now<00:00:57.690> this<00:00:57.870> increases<00:00:58.590> for

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
with staff larger now this increases for

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.770 
with staff larger now this increases for
everything<00:00:59.579> even<00:00:59.850> your<00:00:59.969> healing<00:01:00.300> skills<00:01:00.570> you

can see that the radius gets a little

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.479 
can see that the radius gets a little
bit<00:01:03.930> larger<00:01:04.049> every<00:01:04.409> time<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:04.769> cast<00:01:04.949> which<00:01:05.339> is

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
bit larger every time you cast which is

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.320 
bit larger every time you cast which is
great<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.330> love<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:07.159> secondly<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.340> run<00:01:08.850> with<00:01:08.880> when
