00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:17.810 
and your smart phone with only one line
of<00:00:06.509> code

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.310 

we<00:00:18.820> start<00:00:19.030> off<00:00:19.120> with<00:00:19.240> the<00:00:19.420> components<00:00:19.990> here<00:00:20.140> we

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:20.320 
we start off with the components here we

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.620 
we start off with the components here we
have<00:00:20.530> this<00:00:21.310> core<00:00:21.610> which<00:00:21.850> is<00:00:21.880> going<00:00:22.210> to<00:00:22.300> do<00:00:22.420> the

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 
have this core which is going to do the

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.290 
have this core which is going to do the
rotation<00:00:23.050> of<00:00:23.280> 360<00:00:24.280> degrees<00:00:24.610> to<00:00:24.880> show<00:00:25.180> us

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300 
rotation of 360 degrees to show us

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.540 
rotation of 360 degrees to show us
what's<00:00:25.540> in<00:00:25.750> the<00:00:25.869> room<00:00:25.990> on<00:00:26.800> top<00:00:27.040> of<00:00:27.160> it<00:00:27.280> is<00:00:27.430> the

alright<00:00:40.420> so<00:00:41.520> moving<00:00:42.520> to<00:00:42.850> the<00:00:42.970> code<00:00:43.150> here<00:00:43.480> we're

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:43.629 
alright so moving to the code here we're

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:45.900 
alright so moving to the code here we're
going<00:00:43.720> to<00:00:43.780> use<00:00:43.840> the<00:00:44.230> Skype<00:00:44.500> shield<00:00:45.340> so<00:00:45.670> as

the home automation project you can add

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.380 
the home automation project you can add
a<00:01:09.310> sensor<00:01:09.729> or<00:01:09.760> something

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
a sensor or something

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.480 
a sensor or something
to<00:01:10.659> trigger<00:01:10.870> the<00:01:11.110> video<00:01:11.350> call<00:01:11.590> so<00:01:12.190> in<00:01:12.400> the

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
to trigger the video call so in the

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:13.950 
to trigger the video call so in the
setup<00:01:12.700> we<00:01:12.940> initialize<00:01:13.420> the<00:01:13.570> one<00:01:13.720> shield

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.230 
it go right so here we're setting the
speed<00:01:55.840> and<00:01:56.140> then<00:01:56.350> we<00:01:56.980> go<00:01:57.160> into<00:01:58.030> the<00:01:58.150> right

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
speed and then we go into the right

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.490 
speed and then we go into the right
direction<00:01:58.300> okay<00:01:59.200> so<00:02:00.180> back<00:02:01.180> to<00:02:01.600> the<00:02:02.080> app<00:02:02.200> here

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
direction okay so back to the app here

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.170 
direction okay so back to the app here
we're<00:02:02.710> going<00:02:02.800> to<00:02:02.890> open<00:02:03.070> one<00:02:03.220> shield<00:02:03.550> connect

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
we're going to open one shield connect

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.760 
we're going to open one shield connect
the<00:02:04.270> Arduino<00:02:04.510> to<00:02:04.720> the<00:02:04.930> power<00:02:05.110> so<00:02:05.320> we<00:02:05.380> can<00:02:05.560> pair

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
the Arduino to the power so we can pair

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.630 
the Arduino to the power so we can pair
with<00:02:05.800> it<00:02:06.330> they<00:02:07.330> go<00:02:07.950> now<00:02:08.950> a<00:02:08.979> scan<00:02:09.369> on<00:02:09.580> shield<00:02:10.119> c7

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
with it they go now a scan on shield c7

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.170 
with it they go now a scan on shield c7
connect<00:02:13.800> they<00:02:14.800> go<00:02:14.980> and<00:02:15.190> we<00:02:15.400> have<00:02:15.580> the<00:02:15.940> Skype

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
connect they go and we have the Skype

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.540 
connect they go and we have the Skype
shield<00:02:16.480> here<00:02:16.830> so<00:02:17.830> we're<00:02:17.980> going<00:02:18.069> to<00:02:18.129> open<00:02:18.400> it

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
shield here so we're going to open it

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.990 
shield here so we're going to open it
and<00:02:18.760> we're<00:02:19.209> going<00:02:19.360> to<00:02:19.390> fix<00:02:19.599> this<00:02:19.750> on<00:02:20.610> this<00:02:21.610> RC

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
and we're going to fix this on this RC

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.089 
and we're going to fix this on this RC
car<00:02:22.209> and<00:02:22.510> we're<00:02:22.750> going<00:02:22.900> to<00:02:22.959> like<00:02:23.200> get<00:02:23.769> away<00:02:23.890> the

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
car and we're going to like get away the

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:25.850 
car and we're going to like get away the
laptop<00:02:24.489> we're<00:02:24.640> going<00:02:24.760> to<00:02:24.819> use<00:02:24.970> this<00:02:25.150> to<00:02:25.360> fix

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
laptop we're going to use this to fix

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.590 
laptop we're going to use this to fix
the<00:02:26.860> smartphone<00:02:27.310> on<00:02:27.490> your<00:02:27.670> car<00:02:28.140> so<00:02:29.140> we<00:02:29.260> have

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
the smartphone on your car so we have

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:35.620 
the smartphone on your car so we have
here<00:02:30.820> they<00:02:31.820> go<00:02:33.520> that's<00:02:34.520> it<00:02:34.730> and<00:02:35.030> then<00:02:35.300> we<00:02:35.420> press

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
here they go that's it and then we press

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.260 
here they go that's it and then we press
the<00:02:36.350> reset<00:02:36.560> button<00:02:36.740> on<00:02:37.220> the<00:02:37.490> Arduino<00:02:37.820> so<00:02:38.120> that

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
the reset button on the Arduino so that

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.780 
the reset button on the Arduino so that
it<00:02:38.480> will<00:02:38.660> make<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:39.020> call<00:02:39.200> right<00:02:42.610> so<00:02:43.610> it's

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
it will make the call right so it's

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:50.070 
it will make the call right so it's
making<00:02:44.060> the<00:02:44.150> call<00:02:44.330> here<00:02:47.590> yep<00:02:48.590> there<00:02:48.950> you<00:02:48.980> go

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
making the call here yep there you go

00:02:50.080 --> 00:03:00.280 
making the call here yep there you go
opening<00:02:51.080> the<00:02:51.200> video<00:02:51.440> call<00:02:56.230> yeah<00:02:59.080> so<00:03:00.080> as<00:03:00.200> you

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
opening the video call yeah so as you

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.290 
opening the video call yeah so as you
can<00:03:00.410> see<00:03:00.470> here<00:03:01.360> we're<00:03:02.360> seeing<00:03:04.030> everything<00:03:05.030> in

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
can see here we're seeing everything in

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.320 
can see here we're seeing everything in
the<00:03:05.390> room<00:03:06.400> streaming<00:03:07.400> it<00:03:07.550> let's<00:03:07.880> make<00:03:08.030> it<00:03:08.060> move

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
the room streaming it let's make it move

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:19.920 
the room streaming it let's make it move
a<00:03:08.480> little<00:03:08.630> bit<00:03:08.870> slower<00:03:12.460> yeah

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.199 

so<00:03:20.829> you<00:03:20.890> see<00:03:21.069> how<00:03:21.189> easy<00:03:21.489> it<00:03:21.519> is<00:03:21.640> to<00:03:21.939> video

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
so you see how easy it is to video

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:23.699 
so you see how easy it is to video
stream<00:03:22.569> when<00:03:22.780> you're<00:03:22.930> outside<00:03:23.110> your<00:03:23.500> home

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
stream when you're outside your home

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.429 
stream when you're outside your home
using<00:03:24.129> Arduino<00:03:24.549> and<00:03:24.730> your<00:03:24.819> smartphone<00:03:25.439> think

00:03:26.429 --> 00:03:26.439 
using Arduino and your smartphone think

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:28.470 
using Arduino and your smartphone think
of<00:03:26.560> what<00:03:26.709> else<00:03:26.860> can<00:03:27.099> you<00:03:27.129> do<00:03:27.340> everything<00:03:27.939> in

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
of what else can you do everything in

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.479 
of what else can you do everything in
your<00:03:28.510> phone<00:03:28.840> you<00:03:28.870> can<00:03:29.079> link<00:03:29.379> to<00:03:29.439> Arduino<00:03:29.950> voice

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
your phone you can link to Arduino voice

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.369 
your phone you can link to Arduino voice
recognition<00:03:30.849> text<00:03:31.689> to<00:03:31.870> speech

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:32.379
