 sides white red on the other hand 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.130
 bend it diagonally but the fold does not 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.570
 we do but only plan to the middle of 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:30.599
 one side is now scheduled fold 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:35.010

 we lay down the paper and 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:20.360
 we fold so that 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.360
 the square turned out to be like this 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:27.229

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.050
 diagonal so that it coincides with the corner 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:15.349
 again we are doing our 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:18.500
 intended fold and fold the paper 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:30.319
 so that every corner is connected to 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:35.470
 line corner connected with lazy corner 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:38.090
