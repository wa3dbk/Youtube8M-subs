there's really only one main thing going
on<00:06:12.320> in<00:06:12.500> this<00:06:12.620> issue<00:06:12.830> and<00:06:13.250> that's<00:06:13.730> the<00:06:13.910> fact

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:14.090 
on in this issue and that's the fact

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:17.380 
on in this issue and that's the fact
that<00:06:14.300> the<00:06:15.230> Black<00:06:15.860> Lantern<00:06:16.280> rings<00:06:16.670> that<00:06:17.270> was

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:17.390 
that the Black Lantern rings that was

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.090 
that the Black Lantern rings that was
upon<00:06:17.780> thousands<00:06:18.080> of<00:06:18.170> them<00:06:18.290> are<00:06:18.410> bombarding

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:19.100 
upon thousands of them are bombarding

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:22.840 
upon thousands of them are bombarding
Noah<00:06:19.310> and<00:06:19.760> they're<00:06:20.500> infiltrating<00:06:21.500> the<00:06:22.370> sacred

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:22.850 
Noah and they're infiltrating the sacred

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:24.850 
Noah and they're infiltrating the sacred
crypt<00:06:23.120> of<00:06:23.330> where<00:06:23.510> all<00:06:23.690> of<00:06:23.810> the<00:06:23.960> dead<00:06:24.260> green

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:24.860 
crypt of where all of the dead green

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.660 
crypt of where all of the dead green
lantern<00:06:25.040> corps<00:06:25.490> members<00:06:26.030> are<00:06:26.330> and<00:06:26.870> so<00:06:27.860> there's

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:28.670 
lantern corps members are and so there's

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:30.340 
lantern corps members are and so there's
no<00:06:28.850> longer<00:06:29.180> a<00:06:29.210> protective<00:06:29.630> shell<00:06:29.810> around<00:06:30.050> oya

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:30.350 
no longer a protective shell around oya

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:33.940 
no longer a protective shell around oya
so<00:06:31.360> there's<00:06:32.360> almost<00:06:32.750> nothing<00:06:33.170> that<00:06:33.500> the<00:06:33.710> few

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:33.950 
so there's almost nothing that the few

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:35.320 
so there's almost nothing that the few
green<00:06:34.220> lanterns<00:06:34.580> that<00:06:34.610> are<00:06:34.760> left<00:06:34.910> Hindu<00:06:35.210> to

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:35.330 
green lanterns that are left Hindu to

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.020 
green lanterns that are left Hindu to
possibly<00:06:35.810> protect<00:06:36.050> this<00:06:36.440> so<00:06:37.010> it's<00:06:37.490> just<00:06:37.760> going

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:38.030 
possibly protect this so it's just going

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:41.620 
possibly protect this so it's just going
to<00:06:38.090> be<00:06:38.180> a<00:06:38.450> massive<00:06:39.320> uprising<00:06:39.800> of<00:06:40.630> Black

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:41.630

other interesting thing is that we are

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:48.070 
other interesting thing is that we are
now<00:06:46.700> seeing<00:06:46.940> even<00:06:47.300> though<00:06:47.390> that<00:06:47.570> they're<00:06:47.960> all

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.080

different personalities now we've all
known<00:06:52.460> this<00:06:52.670> for<00:06:53.090> a<00:06:53.150> long<00:06:53.210> time<00:06:53.360> that<00:06:53.990> you<00:06:54.590> know

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:54.890 
known this for a long time that you know

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:58.000 
known this for a long time that you know
Kyle's<00:06:55.790> creative<00:06:56.480> and<00:06:56.870> have<00:06:57.170> got<00:06:57.620> stronger

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:58.010 
Kyle's creative and have got stronger

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:01.630 
Kyle's creative and have got stronger
will<00:06:58.250> power<00:06:58.280> and<00:06:59.170> Guy<00:07:00.170> Gardner<00:07:00.500> is<00:07:01.010> more<00:07:01.370> of<00:07:01.550> a

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:01.640 
will power and Guy Gardner is more of a

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.400 
will power and Guy Gardner is more of a
hothead<00:07:01.850> and<00:07:02.120> so<00:07:02.510> here<00:07:02.780> it<00:07:02.900> really<00:07:03.050> comes<00:07:03.320> out

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:03.410 
hothead and so here it really comes out

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:05.770 
hothead and so here it really comes out
to<00:07:03.530> kids<00:07:03.620> they<00:07:03.710> actually<00:07:04.010> show<00:07:04.190> guy<00:07:04.600> with<00:07:05.600> the

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:05.780 
to kids they actually show guy with the

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:09.040 
to kids they actually show guy with the
ambient<00:07:06.320> rage<00:07:06.920> or<00:07:07.520> going<00:07:08.390> on<00:07:08.630> and<00:07:08.960> I<00:07:09.020> just

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:09.050 
ambient rage or going on and I just

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:10.640 
ambient rage or going on and I just
think<00:07:09.320> that's<00:07:09.380> an<00:07:09.590> ice-cold<00:07:10.160> about

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:10.650 
think that's an ice-cold about

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:11.810 
think that's an ice-cold about
because<00:07:10.949> we<00:07:11.070> think<00:07:11.250> of<00:07:11.400> them<00:07:11.520> as<00:07:11.610> Green

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:11.820 
because we think of them as Green

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:13.879 
because we think of them as Green
Lantern's<00:07:12.210> but<00:07:12.449> at<00:07:12.509> the<00:07:12.600> same<00:07:12.780> time<00:07:13.020> they<00:07:13.860> are

00:07:13.879 --> 00:07:13.889 
Lantern's but at the same time they are

00:07:13.889 --> 00:07:15.620 
Lantern's but at the same time they are
going<00:07:14.250> to<00:07:14.340> be<00:07:14.400> susceptible<00:07:14.759> to<00:07:15.360> all<00:07:15.419> of<00:07:15.540> the
