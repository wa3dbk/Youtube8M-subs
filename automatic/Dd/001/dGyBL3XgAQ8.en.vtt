there taking my storages I know what

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.290 
there taking my storages I know what
he's<00:00:38.489> after<00:00:38.870> this<00:00:39.870> can't<00:00:40.110> be<00:00:40.200> good<00:00:41.090> it<00:00:42.090> doesn't

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
he's after this can't be good it doesn't

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.389 
he's after this can't be good it doesn't
look<00:00:42.450> like<00:00:42.570> he<00:00:42.989> has<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.260> strong<00:00:43.829> hero<00:00:44.219> he

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
look like he has a strong hero he

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.979 
look like he has a strong hero he
doesn't<00:00:44.700> have<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.820> queen<00:00:45.090> either<00:00:45.329> so<00:00:45.660> this<00:00:45.809> guy

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
doesn't have a queen either so this guy

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.799 
doesn't have a queen either so this guy
must<00:00:46.379> be<00:00:46.500> farming<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.300> think<00:00:48.300> these<00:00:48.390> are<00:00:48.450> one<00:00:48.780> of

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
must be farming I think these are one of

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.290 
must be farming I think these are one of
the<00:00:48.960> best<00:00:49.200> troops<00:00:49.440> in<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.710> game<00:00:50.180> having<00:00:51.180> all

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
the best troops in the game having all

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.090 
the best troops in the game having all
arches<00:00:51.690> like<00:00:51.840> this<00:00:52.079> so<00:00:52.320> let's<00:00:52.620> see<00:00:52.800> what<00:00:52.980> he

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
arches like this so let's see what he

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.660 
arches like this so let's see what he
could<00:00:53.250> do

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
could do

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.979 
could do
he's<00:00:54.180> gotten<00:00:54.980> Wow<00:00:56.010> only<00:00:56.370> 19<00:00:56.820> percent<00:00:56.969> he's<00:00:57.870> out

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
he's gotten Wow only 19 percent he's out

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.860 
he's gotten Wow only 19 percent he's out
of<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.350> whole<00:00:58.469> bunch<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.829> artists<00:00:59.160> too

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
of you the whole bunch of artists too

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.789 
of you the whole bunch of artists too
but<00:01:00.870> he's<00:01:00.989> using<00:01:01.140> his<00:01:01.350> lating<00:01:01.680> spills<00:01:03.650> got<00:01:04.650> my

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
but he's using his lating spills got my

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.770 
but he's using his lating spills got my
mortar<00:01:05.180> so<00:01:06.180> I'm<00:01:06.299> thinking<00:01:06.689> this<00:01:06.840> guy<00:01:07.140> is

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
mortar so I'm thinking this guy is

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.570 
mortar so I'm thinking this guy is
probably<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:10.110> champ<00:01:10.530> farmer<00:01:10.979> he<00:01:11.220> can't<00:01:11.460> be

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
probably a champ farmer he can't be

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.810 
probably a champ farmer he can't be
serious<00:01:12.090> about<00:01:12.119> this<00:01:13.250> unless<00:01:14.250> you<00:01:14.520> could<00:01:14.640> pull

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
serious about this unless you could pull

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.190 
serious about this unless you could pull
off<00:01:14.850> some<00:01:15.119> sort<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.360> miracle<00:01:15.570> with<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:15.960> level

off some sort of miracle with that level

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.510
