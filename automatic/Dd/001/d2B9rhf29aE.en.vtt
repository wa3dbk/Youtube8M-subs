five<00:01:07.049> percent<00:01:07.500> chromium<00:01:08.010> I<00:01:08.369> believe<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:09.360> the

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
five percent chromium I believe and the

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.840 
five percent chromium I believe and the
chromium<00:01:09.869> is<00:01:10.080> highly<00:01:10.650> resistant<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.250> rust<00:01:11.520> and

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
chromium is highly resistant to rust and

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.450 
chromium is highly resistant to rust and
and<00:01:12.380> staining<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:13.890> really<00:01:14.040> helps<00:01:14.310> that

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
and staining so it really helps that

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.749 
and staining so it really helps that
stainless<00:01:15.890> quality<00:01:18.619> the<00:01:19.619> handles<00:01:20.369> are<00:01:20.490> as<00:01:20.610> I

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
stainless quality the handles are as I

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.749 
stainless quality the handles are as I
