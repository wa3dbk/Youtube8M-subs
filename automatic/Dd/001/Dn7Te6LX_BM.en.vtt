00:00:05.959 --> 00:00:10.530
 Hello friends , I myself Dima is 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.589
 Secrets and Easter eggs from the game 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.629
 lnr and the first easter egg is in business 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:18.180
 death in silk stockings when we will 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:20.970
 follow the blood trail looking for clues 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.620
 we can stumble upon a trash can in 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.520
 which lies some very strange 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.800
 hat 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.260
 Many players think that this hat 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.990
 somehow connected with the game will give birth to redemption 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.390
 or rather her main character john 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.429
 Mars, and we say the same for those who do not 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.760
 knew that the publishers of both games 

00:00:35.429 --> 00:00:41.519
 is a rockstar well and knowing rockstar 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.019
 it's like they like to add different 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:45.839
 Easter eggs that send us to 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:49.050
 previous games they all may be 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:51.920
 most likely yes most likely it is a hat 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.920
 john marston 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:02.160
 the next easter egg we can see in 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.710
 affair married in heaven and is 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.290
 she is again close to the garbage can 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.300
 in general in the trash can we can find 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.630
 bloodied knife and when we will 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:15.720
 consider it closer then something will 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.760
 there will be a garbage container and it will be on it 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.780
 depicts the assassin's creed logo 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:24.450
 more precisely scratched and of course I can not 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.820
 say exactly what is the logo of the game 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.290
 assassin's greed but still many crayfish 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.290
 burn the fact that it is so 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.070
 and the next Easter egg again applies 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.409
 to the game red dead redemption she goes to 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.320
 black caesar when we are again 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:49.240
 the search for clues in the kitchen that can 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.369
 notice what on toast something 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.830
 depicted and actually make out 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:56.020
 this easter egg is rather difficult only 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.820
 if you are not an ostrich in general you need 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.040
 turn the head but so you don't 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.960
 I was tormented, I specifically turn it over 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.930
 image and now take a look 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.479
 on toasts they seem to be depicted 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.970
 some kind of cowboy and many think that 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.980
 this is john marston though you need to mars on 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.530
 really not like but still 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.540
 cowboy theme 3d mesh on all 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.550
 affairs and the next easter egg also sends 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.830
 us previous game from rockstar only 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.140
 now it is already Gander taffeta in action 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.150
 new moon killings are the last thing 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.930
 in the homicide department when we climb on 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.000
 the roof 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.640
 and the library of los santos to find 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.950
 one of the notes of a maniac we can see 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.650
 from this place that is from the roof 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:39.069
 another building which is called christ 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.810
 will save jazz i vse just like that in gta 2 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:46.090
 was called the church in which the main 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:48.070
 the hero could save the game very much 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.810
 you can often hear the phrase trends 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.060
 of the wto especially in transport 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.250
 Department well and although with English this and 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.829
 translated as carjacking 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.019
 but if it weren't a rockstar then 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:05.019
 one attack is likely sending 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:06.850
 great series gta deed buyer be 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.010
 careful after it happens 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.320
 murder again we will need 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.630
 rummage and find some clues and 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.540
 I think you already guessed where it will be 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:18.850
 next easter egg yes again in the trash 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.180
 tank only now we find there 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:25.470
 gun his serial number is zero 1138 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:28.359
 This is a thx 1138 movie reference. 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.720
 this is george's first feature film 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:30.720
 lukas 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.420
 and back to mission black 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.790
 Caesar in fact can be found conditional 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.710
 referring to rapper fifti cent goal 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.500
 gives an example to the following phrase 

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:48.500
 they say it is better to die young in 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:51.020
 the original good give it the name of one 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:55.240
 of the songs of fifti cent and in fact we 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:55.240
 see only black people 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:09.440
 borrowed in the mission of cradle madness this 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.570

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.680

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.600
 the mission is connected with food or rather with banks 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.669
 vegetable soup in which are hidden 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.190
