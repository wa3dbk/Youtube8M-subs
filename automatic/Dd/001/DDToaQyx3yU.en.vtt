 hello everyone sleds and how can you 

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.460
 notice i left my clan and now 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.330
 I'll be somewhere for about a month to walk on 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.730
 other clans 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.949
 Now I am in the clan plus or minus plus 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:25.010
 and so on if you go into it 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:27.710
 step on, here are his criteria now 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:31.939

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:34.190
 all you read the clan we have level 5 feature 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:36.500
 fifth clans this as you know already that 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.970
 that when you donate the army comes to you 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.130
 1 level more also 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.440
 a little bit more experience but everything in such 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:45.410
 the spirit of that is the fifth level of the clan is 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.969
 in general, clearly if I am not kicked out of here 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.710
 but most likely I will be in it, but if 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:51.920

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.540

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.869
 how now the audience of my channel is no longer 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.759
 500 people and not 1000 and 23 thousand 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:09.679
 man and in principle even if 30 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:11.869
 patients will be active I can not 

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:13.310

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:15.289
 all today we will have a video on 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.780
 construction of the base here is such a base words 

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:19.280
 on the eighth silent principle and the cons of what 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.810
 here here lateral are they still possible 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.179
 take the caterpillars well or ordinary 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.340
 troops but if we assume you have a lot 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:27.950
 little gold and xero then you can do it all 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.690
 swap everything will be fine well on 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.929
 it all drove to watch the building itself 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.929
 bases
