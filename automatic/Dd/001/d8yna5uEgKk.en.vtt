00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
little most of the cards I think I did

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.450 
little most of the cards I think I did
pick<00:00:50.839> up<00:00:50.960> one<00:00:51.290> or<00:00:51.320> two<00:00:51.470> which<00:00:51.860> was<00:00:52.040> pretty<00:00:52.220> nice

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
pick up one or two which was pretty nice

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.579
