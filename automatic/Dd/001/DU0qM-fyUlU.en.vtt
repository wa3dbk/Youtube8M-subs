and is crossing is phenomenal it goes to
the<00:02:15.499> guy's<00:02:15.739> head<00:02:16.069> every<00:02:16.760> single<00:02:16.790> time<00:02:17.480> and

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
the guy's head every single time and

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.679 
the guy's head every single time and
from<00:02:19.099> set<00:02:19.340> pieces<00:02:19.370> as<00:02:19.969> well<00:02:19.999> I<00:02:20.150> actually<00:02:20.389> had<00:02:20.629> a

00:02:20.679 --> 00:02:20.689 
from set pieces as well I actually had a

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:22.089 
from set pieces as well I actually had a
couple<00:02:20.870> of<00:02:20.989> shots<00:02:21.200> of<00:02:21.349> him<00:02:21.499> from<00:02:21.799> set<00:02:22.069> pieces

couple of shots of him from set pieces

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:24.849 
couple of shots of him from set pieces
but<00:02:22.609> I<00:02:22.670> found<00:02:22.939> him<00:02:23.329> more<00:02:23.900> effective<00:02:24.379> ways<00:02:24.560> on

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:24.859 
but I found him more effective ways on

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:26.830 
but I found him more effective ways on
the<00:02:25.010> wing<00:02:25.189> crossing<00:02:26.090> the<00:02:26.180> ball<00:02:26.329> into<00:02:26.569> the

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:51.109 
7 out of 10 just because of his price

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:52.839

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
really he's very expensive for a right

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:55.509 
really he's very expensive for a right
back<00:02:53.060> and<00:02:53.409> to<00:02:54.409> be<00:02:54.530> honest<00:02:54.799> I<00:02:54.949> didn't<00:02:55.250> know<00:02:55.340> it's

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
back and to be honest I didn't know it's

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:57.520 
back and to be honest I didn't know it's
a<00:02:55.609> huge<00:02:56.090> difference<00:02:56.389> from<00:02:56.780> his<00:02:56.930> normal<00:02:57.079> card

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
a huge difference from his normal card

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.520 
a huge difference from his normal card
but<00:02:57.919> if<00:02:58.129> you<00:02:59.000> if<00:02:59.540> you<00:02:59.719> do<00:02:59.840> like<00:03:00.049> him<00:03:00.079> then<00:03:00.379> i'll

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530
