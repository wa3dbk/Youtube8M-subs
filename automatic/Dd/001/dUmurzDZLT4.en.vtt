00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:18.169 
what's with the small amount of storage

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:20.860 
what's with the small amount of storage
this<00:05:18.710> is<00:05:18.860> because<00:05:19.069> flash<00:05:19.279> storage<00:05:19.550> is<00:05:19.879> a<00:05:20.270> bit

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:20.870 
this is because flash storage is a bit

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.839 
this is because flash storage is a bit
was<00:05:21.169> a<00:05:21.289> lot<00:05:21.500> more<00:05:21.529> expensive<00:05:21.889> than<00:05:22.310> mechanical

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:22.849 
was a lot more expensive than mechanical

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:25.269 
was a lot more expensive than mechanical
drives<00:05:23.090> so<00:05:24.080> you<00:05:24.139> have<00:05:24.560> smaller<00:05:24.830> capacities

00:05:25.269 --> 00:05:25.279 
drives so you have smaller capacities

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:27.490 
drives so you have smaller capacities
but<00:05:25.490> they're<00:05:25.669> a<00:05:25.699> lot<00:05:25.909> faster<00:05:26.120> and<00:05:26.659> also

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
but they're a lot faster and also

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:31.079 
but they're a lot faster and also
because<00:05:27.830> apps<00:05:28.370> can<00:05:28.789> take<00:05:29.000> up<00:05:29.259> megabytes<00:05:30.259> and

00:05:31.079 --> 00:05:31.089 
because apps can take up megabytes and

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:33.879 
because apps can take up megabytes and
links<00:05:32.089> can<00:05:32.270> take<00:05:32.449> up<00:05:32.599> get<00:05:33.229> the<00:05:33.349> lights

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:33.889 
links can take up get the lights

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:37.029
