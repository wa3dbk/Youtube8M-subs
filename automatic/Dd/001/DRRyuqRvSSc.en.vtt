00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.270 
using most of the scar creams including
Mederma<00:01:18.320> did<00:01:19.320> not<00:01:19.619> make<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:19.920> difference

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
Mederma did not make a difference

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.649 
Mederma did not make a difference
compared<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.180> using<00:01:21.509> plain<00:01:22.020> KY<00:01:22.740> jelly

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
compared to using plain KY jelly

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.480 
compared to using plain KY jelly
there<00:01:24.659> was<00:01:24.810> only<00:01:24.930> one<00:01:25.049> product<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.860> silicone

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
there was only one product a silicone

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.130 
there was only one product a silicone
based<00:01:26.700> product<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.240> really<00:01:27.720> made<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:27.930> big

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
based product that really made a big

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.109 
based product that really made a big
difference<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.619> I'll<00:01:28.740> explain<00:01:29.040> why<00:01:29.250> one<00:01:30.090> of

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
difference and I'll explain why one of

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.249 
difference and I'll explain why one of
the<00:01:30.210> things<00:01:30.420> that<00:01:30.540> you<00:01:30.630> want<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.840> do<00:01:30.930> with<00:01:31.110> your

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259

the things that you want to do with your
incisions<00:01:31.890> when<00:01:32.610> they're<00:01:32.759> fresh<00:01:33.000> is<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.299> want

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
incisions when they're fresh is you want

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.300 
incisions when they're fresh is you want
to<00:01:33.570> keep<00:01:33.720> them<00:01:33.869> away<00:01:34.200> from<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.590> Sun<00:01:34.890> because

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
to keep them away from the Sun because

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.319 
to keep them away from the Sun because
the<00:01:35.340> Sun<00:01:35.460> will<00:01:35.729> burn<00:01:35.939> it

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
the Sun will burn it

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.300 
the Sun will burn it
see<00:01:36.780> it's<00:01:36.900> pink<00:01:37.290> fresh<00:01:37.590> tissue<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.130> if<00:01:38.189> it

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
see it's pink fresh tissue and if it

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.950 
see it's pink fresh tissue and if it
gets<00:01:38.490> burned<00:01:38.820> it's<00:01:39.420> going<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.659> change<00:01:39.869> a

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
gets burned it's going to change a

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.240 
gets burned it's going to change a
different<00:01:40.079> color<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.710> that's<00:01:40.860> why<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.100> get

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
different color and that's why you get

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.780 
different color and that's why you get
those<00:01:41.460> dark<00:01:41.729> scars<00:01:42.150> so<00:01:43.520> silicone<00:01:44.520> based

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
those dark scars so silicone based

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.179 
those dark scars so silicone based
products<00:01:45.329> will<00:01:46.140> actually<00:01:46.470> create<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.860> barrier

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
products will actually create a barrier

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.100 
products will actually create a barrier
so<00:01:47.430> that<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.030> doesn't<00:01:48.390> scar<00:01:48.659> when<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.960> light

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
so that it doesn't scar when the light

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.560 
so that it doesn't scar when the light
