00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
Arceus because i was expecting it to be

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.100 
Arceus because i was expecting it to be
the<00:01:17.670> extreme<00:01:18.670> killer<00:01:19.090> set<00:01:19.509> you<00:01:19.690> know<00:01:19.810> sort

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110

sins<00:01:20.440> in<00:01:20.619> that<00:01:20.740> extreme<00:01:21.160> speed<00:01:21.600> so<00:01:23.340> saying

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
sins in that extreme speed so saying

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.940 
sins in that extreme speed so saying
this<00:01:24.429> goes<00:01:24.610> for<00:01:24.789> close<00:01:24.940> combat<00:01:25.179> and<00:01:25.570> does<00:01:25.950> just

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
this goes for close combat and does just

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.039 
this goes for close combat and does just
about<00:01:27.130> half<00:01:27.670> which<00:01:28.149> kind<00:01:28.450> of<00:01:28.509> sucks<00:01:28.869> because

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 
about half which kind of sucks because

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:31.560 
about half which kind of sucks because
it<00:01:29.320> was<00:01:29.439> a<00:01:29.640> super<00:01:30.640> effective<00:01:31.000> but<00:01:31.360> it's

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
it was a super effective but it's

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.240 
it was a super effective but it's
understandable<00:01:32.320> because<00:01:32.500> I<00:01:32.650> don't<00:01:32.920> have<00:01:33.070> any

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
understandable because I don't have any

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.770 
understandable because I don't have any
attacking<00:01:33.670> these<00:01:33.970> and<00:01:34.240> I<00:01:34.330> have<00:01:34.420> a<00:01:34.450> minus

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
attacking these and I have a minus

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.440 
attacking these and I have a minus
attack<00:01:35.200> nature

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
attack nature

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.160 
attack nature
then<00:01:36.719> off<00:01:37.380> goes<00:01:37.939> tried<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.119> dang<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.780> try

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
then off goes tried to dang it try

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.469 
then off goes tried to dang it try
attack<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:41.100> almost<00:01:41.280> knocks<00:01:41.700> out<00:01:41.880> Arceus<00:01:42.270> but

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
attack and almost knocks out Arceus but

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.690 
attack and almost knocks out Arceus but
I<00:01:42.509> get<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.719> burn<00:01:42.960> on<00:01:42.990> him<00:01:43.439> which<00:01:43.740> was<00:01:43.950> nice<00:01:44.130> and

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
I get a burn on him which was nice and

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.039 
I get a burn on him which was nice and
that<00:01:44.850> kind<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.090> saved<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.509> day<00:01:45.659> but<00:01:45.899> it

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
that kind of saved the day but it

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.090 
that kind of saved the day but it
doesn't<00:01:46.320> really<00:01:46.380> matter<00:01:46.590> because<00:01:46.799> he<00:01:46.979> was

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
doesn't really matter because he was

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.200 
doesn't really matter because he was
going<00:01:47.310> for<00:01:47.369> freaking<00:01:48.380> shadow<00:01:49.380> force<00:01:49.829> and<00:01:50.210> he

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
going for freaking shadow force and he

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.230 
going for freaking shadow force and he
wouldn't<00:01:51.539> have<00:01:51.719> hit<00:01:52.170> me<00:01:52.350> anyway<00:01:52.819> so<00:01:53.819> our<00:01:54.030> seas

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
wouldn't have hit me anyway so our seas

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.389 
wouldn't have hit me anyway so our seas
goes<00:01:54.420> down<00:01:54.600> with<00:01:54.810> burn<00:01:55.049> which<00:01:55.979> was<00:01:56.189> nice

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
goes down with burn which was nice

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.669 
goes down with burn which was nice
because<00:01:56.729> now<00:01:57.360> he<00:01:57.420> can<00:01:57.569> send<00:01:57.899> out<00:01:57.990> his<00:01:58.170> next<00:01:58.350> guy

00:01:58.669 --> 00:01:58.679 
because now he can send out his next guy

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:02.359 
because now he can send out his next guy
and<00:01:59.039> I<00:01:59.100> don't<00:01:59.310> even<00:01:59.369> worry<00:01:59.700> about<00:02:01.069> taking<00:02:02.069> him

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
and I don't even worry about taking him

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.459 
and I don't even worry about taking him
down<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:02.700> next<00:02:02.909> term<00:02:03.000> so<00:02:03.600> out<00:02:03.750> comes<00:02:03.869> Paul<00:02:04.229> Pia

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
down the next term so out comes Paul Pia

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.800 
down the next term so out comes Paul Pia
and<00:02:05.039> i'm<00:02:05.189> still<00:02:05.520> in<00:02:05.850> vulnerable<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.569> Kira

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
and i'm still in vulnerable to Kira

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.839 
and i'm still in vulnerable to Kira
Tina's<00:02:07.259> shadow<00:02:08.039> force<00:02:08.399> so<00:02:08.519> I<00:02:08.580> can<00:02:08.729> just

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
Tina's shadow force so I can just

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.370 
Tina's shadow force so I can just
concentrate<00:02:09.179> all<00:02:09.479> my<00:02:09.599> efforts<00:02:09.899> on<00:02:10.019> Palkia

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
concentrate all my efforts on Palkia

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.860 
concentrate all my efforts on Palkia
which<00:02:11.160> was<00:02:11.340> nice<00:02:11.489> because<00:02:11.569> that<00:02:12.569> worked<00:02:12.720> out

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
which was nice because that worked out

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.250 
which was nice because that worked out
kind<00:02:13.080> of<00:02:13.230> well<00:02:13.410> so<00:02:14.220> I<00:02:14.250> go<00:02:15.060> with<00:02:15.269> another<00:02:15.959> close

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
kind of well so I go with another close

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.960 
kind of well so I go with another close
combat<00:02:16.560> and<00:02:17.010> then<00:02:17.130> I<00:02:17.220> also<00:02:17.250> go<00:02:17.670> with<00:02:17.700> another

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
combat and then I also go with another

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.580 
combat and then I also go with another
try<00:02:18.329> attack<00:02:18.630> of<00:02:18.780> Paul<00:02:18.930> K<00:02:19.049> I<00:02:19.140> was<00:02:19.260> really<00:02:19.440> hoping

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
try attack of Paul K I was really hoping

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.800 
try attack of Paul K I was really hoping
for<00:02:19.890> a<00:02:19.920> paralysis<00:02:20.280> right<00:02:20.730> here<00:02:21.000> but<00:02:21.569> it

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
for a paralysis right here but it

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.890 
for a paralysis right here but it
doesn't<00:02:22.019> really<00:02:22.140> matter<00:02:22.319> so<00:02:23.220> it<00:02:24.120> goes<00:02:24.360> close

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
doesn't really matter so it goes close

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.809 
doesn't really matter so it goes close
combat<00:02:25.170> does<00:02:25.470> like<00:02:25.680> nothing<00:02:26.250> which<00:02:26.549> kind<00:02:26.730> of

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819 
combat does like nothing which kind of

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.640 
combat does like nothing which kind of
sucks<00:02:27.060> but<00:02:27.180> look<00:02:27.360> at<00:02:27.450> this<00:02:27.630> okay<00:02:28.019> hold<00:02:28.440> on

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
sucks but look at this okay hold on

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.500 
sucks but look at this okay hold on
after<00:02:28.890> my<00:02:29.130> defenses<00:02:29.579> fall<00:02:29.760> this<00:02:30.180> has<00:02:30.299> got<00:02:30.480> to

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
after my defenses fall this has got to

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.089 
after my defenses fall this has got to
be<00:02:30.599> the<00:02:30.750> fastest<00:02:31.200> palki<00:02:31.560> I've<00:02:31.650> ever<00:02:31.860> seen

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
be the fastest palki I've ever seen

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.229 
be the fastest palki I've ever seen
because<00:02:32.579> he<00:02:33.150> just<00:02:33.329> outspent<00:02:33.870> my<00:02:33.989> porygon<00:02:34.470> z

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
because he just outspent my porygon z

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.210 
because he just outspent my porygon z
that's<00:02:36.239> never<00:02:36.540> happened<00:02:36.959> before<00:02:37.010> this<00:02:38.010> one's

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
that's never happened before this one's

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.699 
that's never happened before this one's
got<00:02:38.370> to<00:02:38.519> have<00:02:38.670> max<00:02:39.000> IVs<00:02:39.599> and<00:02:39.630> maybe<00:02:40.230> a<00:02:40.349> speed

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
got to have max IVs and maybe a speed

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.599 
got to have max IVs and maybe a speed
nature<00:02:41.160> at<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:42.269> very<00:02:42.569> least<00:02:42.920> 250<00:02:43.920> 2<00:02:44.040> v's<00:02:44.430> of

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
speed and a speed nature at the very

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.340 
speed and a speed nature at the very
least<00:02:47.040> I<00:02:47.510> wouldn't<00:02:48.510> be<00:02:48.569> surprised<00:02:48.930> if<00:02:49.049> he<00:02:49.170> also

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
least I wouldn't be surprised if he also

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.900 
least I wouldn't be surprised if he also
has<00:02:49.650> IVs<00:02:50.160> and<00:02:50.190> speed<00:02:50.670> but<00:02:51.049> still

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
has IVs and speed but still

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.330 
has IVs and speed but still
so<00:02:53.540> zangoose<00:02:54.290> goes<00:02:54.470> down<00:02:54.620> to<00:02:54.740> drag<00:02:54.950> a<00:02:54.980> meat-eor

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
so zangoose goes down to drag a meat-eor

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.310 
so zangoose goes down to drag a meat-eor
and<00:02:55.730> then<00:02:55.970> try<00:02:56.240> to<00:02:56.270> attack<00:02:56.600> those<00:02:56.780> off<00:02:57.020> and

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
and then try to attack those off and

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.400 
and then try to attack those off and
almost<00:02:57.890> knocks<00:02:58.370> it<00:02:58.550> out<00:02:58.610> from<00:02:58.850> right<00:02:58.970> there<00:02:59.410> so

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
almost knocks it out from right there so

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.890 
almost knocks it out from right there so
that<00:03:00.800> was<00:03:00.920> nice<00:03:01.330> giratina<00:03:02.330> goes<00:03:02.540> for<00:03:02.720> shadow

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
that was nice giratina goes for shadow

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.290 
that was nice giratina goes for shadow
