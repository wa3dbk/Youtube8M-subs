 exposed once downloaded 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.960

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.130

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.650

 ready and we can restart our 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.299
 terminal does not restart it now because it 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.179
 will cut the video but once done that 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.220
