it's<00:01:59.939> a<00:02:00.030> pretty<00:02:00.210> tight<00:02:00.509> fit<00:02:00.979> once<00:02:01.979> it's<00:02:02.159> on

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
it's a pretty tight fit once it's on

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.390 
it's a pretty tight fit once it's on
their<00:02:02.610> kind<00:02:03.210> of<00:02:03.330> pushing<00:02:03.659> it<00:02:03.780> all<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.080> way<00:02:04.170> in

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
their kind of pushing it all the way in

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.210 
their kind of pushing it all the way in
it<00:02:05.400> is<00:02:05.549> a<00:02:05.580> rather<00:02:05.729> tight<00:02:06.030> fit<00:02:06.360> but<00:02:07.129> once<00:02:08.129> you

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
it is a rather tight fit but once you

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.199 
it is a rather tight fit but once you
get<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:08.429> on<00:02:08.519> there<00:02:08.610> if<00:02:08.700> it's<00:02:08.849> quite<00:02:09.030> nicely

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
get it on there if it's quite nicely

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.360 
get it on there if it's quite nicely
then<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.989> bottom<00:02:10.289> piece<00:02:10.470> obviously<00:02:11.189> just

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
then the bottom piece obviously just

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.809 
then the bottom piece obviously just
snaps<00:02:11.610> together<00:02:11.849> as<00:02:12.120> well<00:02:12.299> and<00:02:12.569> there<00:02:13.530> you<00:02:13.650> go

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
snaps together as well and there you go

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.449 
snaps together as well and there you go
all<00:02:14.819> together<00:02:15.150> so<00:02:16.019> you<00:02:16.409> have<00:02:16.560> a<00:02:16.590> full<00:02:17.040> cut<00:02:17.340> out

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
all together so you have a full cut out

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.119 
all together so you have a full cut out
on<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:17.819> side<00:02:18.180> for<00:02:19.049> your<00:02:19.319> vibrate<00:02:19.950> switch

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
on the side for your vibrate switch

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.460 
on the side for your vibrate switch
which<00:02:20.580> is<00:02:20.760> easy<00:02:20.970> to<00:02:21.060> get<00:02:21.300> to<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:21.660> your<00:02:22.140> volume

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
which is easy to get to and your volume

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.740 
which is easy to get to and your volume
rocker<00:02:22.739> full<00:02:23.250> cut<00:02:23.520> out<00:02:23.700> there<00:02:23.940> and<00:02:24.209> then

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
rocker full cut out there and then

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:25.980 
rocker full cut out there and then
individual<00:02:25.380> cutouts

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
individual cutouts

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.590 
individual cutouts

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
is really recessed may have some issues

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.130 
is really recessed may have some issues
with<00:02:33.430> certain<00:02:33.970> headsets<00:02:34.390> this<00:02:34.690> is<00:02:34.840> a<00:02:34.870> pretty

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
with certain headsets this is a pretty

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.710 
with certain headsets this is a pretty
deep<00:02:35.470> hole<00:02:35.500> right<00:02:35.950> there<00:02:36.010> on<00:02:36.520> the<00:02:36.970> back<00:02:37.090> your

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
deep hole right there on the back your

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.900 
deep hole right there on the back your
camera<00:02:38.410> lens<00:02:38.590> lines<00:02:38.890> up<00:02:39.130> pretty<00:02:39.430> well<00:02:39.490> it's

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
camera lens lines up pretty well it's

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.400 
camera lens lines up pretty well it's
slightly<00:02:40.180> off-center<00:02:40.450> but<00:02:40.750> nothing<00:02:41.200> major

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
slightly off-center but nothing major

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.590 
slightly off-center but nothing major
and<00:02:41.800> then<00:02:42.340> on<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:42.520> bottom<00:02:42.700> there<00:02:43.210> is<00:02:43.360> no

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
and then on the bottom there is no

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.860 
and then on the bottom there is no
connection<00:02:44.350> at<00:02:44.650> all<00:02:44.830> to<00:02:45.700> get<00:02:45.850> through<00:02:46.180> kind<00:02:46.780> of

connection at all to get through kind of

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.160 
connection at all to get through kind of
my<00:02:46.930> biggest<00:02:48.300> con<00:02:49.300> if<00:02:49.600> you<00:02:49.720> will<00:02:49.900> with<00:02:50.020> this

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
my biggest con if you will with this

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.140 
my biggest con if you will with this
case<00:02:50.410> is<00:02:50.800> there's<00:02:51.400> nothing<00:02:51.520> on<00:02:51.790> the<00:02:51.880> bottom

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
case is there's nothing on the bottom

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.820 
case is there's nothing on the bottom
you<00:02:52.270> can't<00:02:52.510> get<00:02:52.660> to<00:02:52.780> your<00:02:52.900> dock<00:02:53.260> connector<00:02:53.710> at

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
you can't get to your dock connector at

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.220 
you can't get to your dock connector at
all<00:02:53.950> so<00:02:54.430> when<00:02:54.730> you<00:02:54.820> want<00:02:54.970> to<00:02:55.060> dock<00:02:55.270> this<00:02:55.600> you<00:02:56.110> do

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
all so when you want to dock this you do

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.140 
all so when you want to dock this you do
have<00:02:56.350> to<00:02:56.530> pop<00:02:56.710> the<00:02:56.890> bottom<00:02:57.190> off<00:02:57.370> and<00:02:57.640> then<00:02:58.030> you

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
have to pop the bottom off and then you

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.120 
have to pop the bottom off and then you
can<00:02:58.270> stick<00:02:58.510> it<00:02:58.600> in<00:02:58.720> your<00:02:58.810> dock<00:02:58.990> or<00:02:59.320> you<00:03:00.010> know

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
can stick it in your dock or you know

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.340 
can stick it in your dock or you know
plug<00:03:00.370> your<00:03:00.490> cable<00:03:00.850> in<00:03:01.000> or<00:03:01.210> whatever<00:03:01.420> you<00:03:01.720> want

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
plug your cable in or whatever you want

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.130 
plug your cable in or whatever you want
to<00:03:02.440> do<00:03:02.560> so<00:03:02.920> you<00:03:03.580> can't<00:03:04.000> dock<00:03:04.210> it<00:03:04.420> I'm<00:03:04.570> sure<00:03:04.840> even

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
to do so you can't dock it I'm sure even

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.630 
to do so you can't dock it I'm sure even
if<00:03:05.230> it<00:03:05.350> did<00:03:05.560> have<00:03:05.740> a<00:03:05.770> dock<00:03:06.130> connector<00:03:06.520> on<00:03:06.610> the

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
if it did have a dock connector on the

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.880 
if it did have a dock connector on the
bottom<00:03:06.790> it's<00:03:07.660> pretty<00:03:07.990> thick<00:03:08.290> and<00:03:08.470> beefy<00:03:08.800> I'm

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
bottom it's pretty thick and beefy I'm

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.340 
bottom it's pretty thick and beefy I'm
not<00:03:09.100> sure<00:03:09.370> that<00:03:09.400> it<00:03:09.640> would<00:03:09.700> fit<00:03:10.060> on<00:03:10.270> in<00:03:10.840> a<00:03:11.080> dock

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
not sure that it would fit on in a dock

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.890 
not sure that it would fit on in a dock
anyway<00:03:11.830> because<00:03:12.040> it's<00:03:12.190> so<00:03:12.490> big<00:03:12.730> but<00:03:13.360> uh<00:03:13.390> you

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
anyway because it's so big but uh you

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.390 
anyway because it's so big but uh you
know<00:03:13.990> not<00:03:14.230> necessarily<00:03:14.350> a<00:03:14.710> major<00:03:14.950> big<00:03:15.220> deal

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
know not necessarily a major big deal

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.100 
know not necessarily a major big deal
but<00:03:15.610> if<00:03:15.730> I<00:03:15.820> had<00:03:15.940> to<00:03:15.970> kind<00:03:16.210> of<00:03:16.360> find<00:03:16.510> one<00:03:16.810> fault

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
but if I had to kind of find one fault

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.780 
but if I had to kind of find one fault
with<00:03:17.290> this<00:03:17.470> it<00:03:17.950> would<00:03:18.130> be<00:03:18.310> that<00:03:18.460> there's<00:03:18.670> no

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
with this it would be that there's no

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.690 
with this it would be that there's no
cut<00:03:19.030> outs<00:03:19.180> you<00:03:19.420> do<00:03:19.600> though<00:03:19.810> have<00:03:19.840> nice

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
cut outs you do though have nice

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.770 
cut outs you do though have nice
perforated<00:03:21.700> holes<00:03:21.910> for<00:03:22.240> your<00:03:22.330> speaker<00:03:22.660> and

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
perforated holes for your speaker and

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.930 
perforated holes for your speaker and
microphone<00:03:22.930> so<00:03:23.410> you<00:03:23.920> can<00:03:24.100> hear<00:03:24.310> that<00:03:24.370> just
