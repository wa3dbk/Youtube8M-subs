change the current system there were two
reasons<00:00:51.920> for<00:00:52.280> that<00:00:52.480> first<00:00:53.480> one<00:00:53.690> at<00:00:53.960> the<00:00:54.559> moment

00:00:54.669 --> 00:00:54.679 
reasons for that first one at the moment

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:58.979 
reasons for that first one at the moment
every<00:00:55.309> time<00:00:55.519> player<00:00:56.269> text<00:00:56.749> is<00:00:57.140> forced<00:00:57.620> to<00:00:57.739> stop

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
and stops what nearly makes it

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.450 
and stops what nearly makes it
