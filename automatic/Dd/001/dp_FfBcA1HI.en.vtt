00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
first two steps are going to just be

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.040 
first two steps are going to just be
slow<00:00:56.879> in<00:00:57.120> nature<00:00:57.510> they're<00:00:57.660> not<00:00:57.780> going<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:57.989> be

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
slow in nature they're not going to be

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.540 
slow in nature they're not going to be
real<00:00:58.260> fast<00:00:58.559> he's<00:00:58.920> going<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.129> be<00:00:59.219> getting<00:00:59.370> the

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
real fast he's going to be getting the

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.099 
real fast he's going to be getting the
one<00:00:59.760> and<00:00:59.910> three<00:01:00.090> step<00:01:00.390> readout<00:01:00.899> of<00:01:00.930> the

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
one and three step readout of the

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.020 
one and three step readout of the
quarterback<00:01:01.649> for<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.250> quick<00:01:02.520> game<00:01:02.789> while

he's<00:01:03.210> doing<00:01:03.390> that<00:01:03.570> then<00:01:04.409> he<00:01:04.650> will<00:01:04.830> continue<00:01:05.250> on

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
he's doing that then he will continue on

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.300 
he's doing that then he will continue on
from<00:01:05.939> there<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.780> get<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.530> momentum<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:08.130> his

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
goal routes now you can see that he got

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.179 
goal routes now you can see that he got
his<00:01:53.600> good<00:01:54.600> stance<00:01:54.960> Aries<00:01:55.409> nice<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:55.979> loose

and now he's working his arms to get the

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.800 
and now he's working his arms to get the
finish<00:02:00.630> of<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:01.290> whole<00:02:01.469> backpedal<00:02:02.070> action<00:02:02.810> the

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
finish of the whole backpedal action the

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.539 
finish of the whole backpedal action the
next<00:02:03.840> drill<00:02:04.799> here<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.250> we're<00:02:05.369> going<00:02:05.490> to

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
next drill here that we're going to

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.219 
next drill here that we're going to
start<00:02:05.820> talking<00:02:06.000> about<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.780> we're<00:02:06.960> going<00:02:07.140> to

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
start talking about and we're going to

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.040 
start talking about and we're going to
work<00:02:07.950> on<00:02:08.190> is<00:02:08.270> what<00:02:09.270> we<00:02:09.390> call<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:09.810> brake<00:02:10.020> and

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
work on is what we call the brake and

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.240 
work on is what we call the brake and
drive

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
drive

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.970 
drive
and<00:02:11.370> this<00:02:11.760> is<00:02:12.000> where<00:02:12.300> that<00:02:12.900> transition<00:02:13.710> from

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
and this is where that transition from

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.550 
and this is where that transition from
the<00:02:14.040> back<00:02:14.370> pedal<00:02:14.840> to<00:02:15.840> moving<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.380> body

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
the back pedal to moving the body

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.240 
the back pedal to moving the body
forward<00:02:17.040> on<00:02:17.460> and<00:02:18.060> out<00:02:18.210> on<00:02:18.570> a<00:02:18.630> curl<00:02:19.230> on<00:02:19.590> a<00:02:19.650> slant

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
forward on and out on a curl on a slant

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.930 
forward on and out on a curl on a slant
takes<00:02:20.910> place<00:02:21.240> and<00:02:21.590> so<00:02:22.590> it's<00:02:22.980> that<00:02:23.220> transition

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
takes place and so it's that transition

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.550 
takes place and so it's that transition
from<00:02:24.210> back<00:02:24.510> pedal<00:02:25.100> to<00:02:26.100> moving<00:02:26.730> forward<00:02:27.270> as

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
from back pedal to moving forward as

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.860 
from back pedal to moving forward as
quick<00:02:28.560> as<00:02:28.740> you<00:02:28.860> can<00:02:28.890> with<00:02:29.760> no<00:02:30.030> wasted<00:02:30.540> steps

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
quick as you can with no wasted steps

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.620 
quick as you can with no wasted steps
with<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:31.920> exact<00:02:32.340> angle<00:02:32.580> that<00:02:32.910> you<00:02:33.150> need<00:02:33.420> to

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
with the exact angle that you need to

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.870 
with the exact angle that you need to
make<00:02:33.780> a<00:02:33.840> play<00:02:34.200> you<00:02:34.890> know<00:02:35.010> on<00:02:35.190> that<00:02:35.459> receiver

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
make a play you know on that receiver

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.160 
make a play you know on that receiver
and<00:02:36.180> ball<00:02:36.360> on<00:02:36.660> the<00:02:37.140> finish<00:02:37.470> and<00:02:37.709> to<00:02:38.700> do<00:02:38.880> this

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
and ball on the finish and to do this

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.990 
and ball on the finish and to do this
we've<00:02:40.170> basically<00:02:40.410> got<00:02:40.920> a<00:02:40.950> very<00:02:41.340> simple

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
we've basically got a very simple

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.229 
we've basically got a very simple
concept<00:02:42.720> and<00:02:43.440> it's<00:02:44.160> nothing<00:02:44.400> different<00:02:44.790> than

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
concept and it's nothing different than

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.590 
concept and it's nothing different than
what<00:02:46.200> you<00:02:46.620> were<00:02:46.830> teaching<00:02:47.520> your<00:02:47.970> guys<00:02:48.239> and

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
what you were teaching your guys and

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.630 
what you were teaching your guys and
track<00:02:48.900> in<00:02:49.200> terms<00:02:49.800> of<00:02:49.980> getting<00:02:50.130> out<00:02:50.430> of<00:02:50.459> the

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
track in terms of getting out of the

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.870 
track in terms of getting out of the
blocks<00:02:54.020> you<00:02:55.020> can<00:02:55.230> see<00:02:55.470> that<00:02:55.650> it's<00:02:55.800> a<00:02:55.920> 12<00:02:56.400> action

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
blocks you can see that it's a 12 action

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.030 
blocks you can see that it's a 12 action
for<00:02:57.120> us<00:02:57.209> okay<00:02:57.810> there's<00:02:58.050> no<00:02:58.230> wasted<00:02:58.739> steps

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
for us okay there's no wasted steps

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.220 
for us okay there's no wasted steps
there<00:02:59.340> we're<00:03:00.000> basically<00:03:00.450> going<00:03:00.840> to<00:03:00.959> try<00:03:01.170> to

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
there we're basically going to try to

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.140 
there we're basically going to try to
make<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.680> same<00:03:01.950> kind<00:03:02.010> of<00:03:02.400> transfer<00:03:02.880> as<00:03:03.000> we

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
make the same kind of transfer as we

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.449 
make the same kind of transfer as we
would<00:03:03.390> if<00:03:03.570> we're<00:03:03.750> in<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:04.050> blocks<00:03:04.350> and<00:03:04.650> attract

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
would if we're in the blocks and attract

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.300 
would if we're in the blocks and attract
me<00:03:05.959> you<00:03:06.959> can<00:03:07.140> see<00:03:07.350> how<00:03:07.500> I've<00:03:07.709> got<00:03:07.950> them<00:03:08.130> turning

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
me you can see how I've got them turning

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.690 
me you can see how I've got them turning
the<00:03:08.670> toe<00:03:08.910> on<00:03:09.180> the<00:03:09.209> brake<00:03:10.020> foot<00:03:10.380> that<00:03:10.709> stops<00:03:11.459> our

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
the toe on the brake foot that stops our

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.990 
the toe on the brake foot that stops our
backpedal<00:03:12.680> just<00:03:13.680> slightly<00:03:14.220> turning<00:03:14.580> the<00:03:14.790> toe

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
backpedal just slightly turning the toe

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.840 
backpedal just slightly turning the toe
out<00:03:15.239> so<00:03:15.480> the<00:03:15.750> ball<00:03:15.930> of<00:03:16.080> the<00:03:16.170> foot<00:03:16.459> okay<00:03:17.459> we<00:03:17.670> get

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
out so the ball of the foot okay we get

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.400 
out so the ball of the foot okay we get
in<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.090> ground<00:03:18.330> and<00:03:18.600> not<00:03:18.720> just<00:03:19.019> the<00:03:19.170> front

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
in the ground and not just the front

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.949 
in the ground and not just the front
cleats<00:03:19.739> then<00:03:20.549> that<00:03:20.790> second<00:03:21.269> step<00:03:21.540> that's

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
cleats then that second step that's

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.600 
cleats then that second step that's
involved<00:03:22.410> in<00:03:22.620> this<00:03:22.769> is<00:03:22.980> just<00:03:23.190> to<00:03:23.280> get<00:03:23.430> that

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
involved in this is just to get that

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.610 
involved in this is just to get that
weight<00:03:23.850> transferred<00:03:24.450> to<00:03:24.660> that<00:03:24.810> front<00:03:25.110> foot<00:03:25.200> as

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
weight transferred to that front foot as

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.979 
weight transferred to that front foot as
quick<00:03:26.190> as<00:03:26.340> we<00:03:26.370> can<00:03:26.790> and<00:03:27.060> that<00:03:27.239> becomes<00:03:27.810> our

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
quick as we can and that becomes our

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.520 
quick as we can and that becomes our
Drive<00:03:28.290> foot<00:03:28.590> and<00:03:29.239> it's<00:03:30.239> very<00:03:30.510> similar<00:03:30.840> to<00:03:31.019> just

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
Drive foot and it's very similar to just

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.560 
Drive foot and it's very similar to just
being<00:03:31.709> in<00:03:31.980> the<00:03:32.010> blocks<00:03:32.519> of<00:03:32.850> a<00:03:32.940> track<00:03:33.180> meet<00:03:33.209> and

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
being in the blocks of a track meet and

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.360 
being in the blocks of a track meet and
I<00:03:33.750> kind<00:03:34.049> of<00:03:34.170> show<00:03:34.350> this<00:03:34.560> to<00:03:34.739> the<00:03:34.769> guys<00:03:35.040> and<00:03:35.280> I

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
I kind of show this to the guys and I

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.070 
I kind of show this to the guys and I
say<00:03:35.580> hey<00:03:35.700> you<00:03:35.760> remember<00:03:36.360> what<00:03:36.810> it<00:03:36.930> was<00:03:37.049> like

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:37.080 
say hey you remember what it was like

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.860 
say hey you remember what it was like
and<00:03:37.560> you<00:03:38.280> can<00:03:38.459> see<00:03:38.670> here<00:03:38.970> that<00:03:39.000> that<00:03:39.299> back<00:03:39.570> foot

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
and you can see here that that back foot

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.080 
and you can see here that that back foot
is<00:03:40.110> what<00:03:40.320> we<00:03:40.440> call<00:03:40.709> our<00:03:40.890> break<00:03:41.160> foot<00:03:41.459> at<00:03:41.640> front

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
is what we call our break foot at front

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.750 
is what we call our break foot at front
foot<00:03:42.329> is<00:03:42.480> our<00:03:42.690> dry<00:03:43.260> foot<00:03:43.620> and<00:03:43.829> it's<00:03:43.980> the<00:03:44.370> same

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760

what<00:03:59.400> I'm<00:03:59.519> just<00:03:59.760> assimilating<00:04:00.510> here<00:04:00.750> now<00:04:00.959> as

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
what I'm just assimilating here now as

what I'm just assimilating here now as
you<00:04:01.799> see<00:04:02.010> I<00:04:02.040> just<00:04:02.130> have<00:04:02.549> him<00:04:02.760> work<00:04:03.000> in<00:04:03.150> his<00:04:03.269> feet

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
you see I just have him work in his feet

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.060 
you see I just have him work in his feet
where<00:04:03.750> he<00:04:03.870> just<00:04:04.140> turns<00:04:04.410> us<00:04:04.590> toes<00:04:04.829> slightly

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
where he just turns us toes slightly

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.490 
where he just turns us toes slightly
outward<00:04:05.760> gets<00:04:06.329> the<00:04:06.600> ball<00:04:06.810> of<00:04:06.989> the<00:04:07.079> foot<00:04:07.110> in<00:04:07.410> the

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
outward gets the ball of the foot in the

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.770 
outward gets the ball of the foot in the
ground<00:04:07.709> don't<00:04:08.430> sink<00:04:08.790> weight<00:04:09.090> back<00:04:09.360> on<00:04:09.390> your

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
ground don't sink weight back on your

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.600 
ground don't sink weight back on your
heel<00:04:10.049> because<00:04:10.709> we<00:04:10.829> want<00:04:10.980> to<00:04:11.130> transfer<00:04:11.579> that

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
heel because we want to transfer that

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.520 
heel because we want to transfer that
weight<00:04:12.030> from<00:04:12.209> that<00:04:12.390> back<00:04:12.630> foot<00:04:12.900> to<00:04:13.079> that<00:04:13.230> front

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
weight from that back foot to that front

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.340 
weight from that back foot to that front
foot<00:04:13.590> as<00:04:13.920> quick<00:04:14.459> as<00:04:14.610> we<00:04:14.640> can<00:04:15.030> with<00:04:15.299> a<00:04:15.329> 12<00:04:15.870> action

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
foot as quick as we can with a 12 action

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.650 
foot as quick as we can with a 12 action
and<00:04:16.500> that's<00:04:17.340> how<00:04:17.489> I<00:04:17.519> start<00:04:17.940> just<00:04:18.180> teaching<00:04:18.540> it

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
and that's how I start just teaching it

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.510 
and that's how I start just teaching it
no<00:04:18.810> movement<00:04:19.289> at<00:04:19.349> all<00:04:19.500> just<00:04:19.890> get<00:04:20.039> the<00:04:20.190> feel<00:04:20.489> of

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:20.520 
no movement at all just get the feel of

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:23.120 
no movement at all just get the feel of
you<00:04:20.940> dropping<00:04:21.450> that<00:04:21.570> break<00:04:22.289> foot<00:04:22.560> back<00:04:22.800> there

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
you dropping that break foot back there

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.030 
you dropping that break foot back there
and<00:04:23.310> get

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
and get

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.290 
and get
that<00:04:24.130> ball<00:04:24.370> of<00:04:24.550> the<00:04:24.610> foot<00:04:24.790> into<00:04:25.180> the<00:04:25.270> ground

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
that ball of the foot into the ground

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.480 
that ball of the foot into the ground
without<00:04:25.780> the<00:04:26.110> heel<00:04:26.380> and<00:04:26.410> now<00:04:26.830> we're<00:04:27.130> talking

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
without the heel and now we're talking

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.060 
without the heel and now we're talking
about<00:04:27.580> transferring<00:04:28.300> wait<00:04:28.570> okay<00:04:29.410> so<00:04:29.470> now<00:04:29.860> it's

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
about transferring wait okay so now it's

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:36.090 
about transferring wait okay so now it's

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
steps here nice control but now he's

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:02.000 
steps here nice control but now he's
working<00:04:57.700> the<00:04:57.730> one<00:04:57.970> to<00:04:58.210> break<00:04:58.480> and<00:04:58.720> drive<00:04:59.700> and

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
working the one to break and drive and

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.590 
working the one to break and drive and
that's<00:05:03.010> the<00:05:03.310> teaching<00:05:03.730> progression<00:05:04.330> that<00:05:04.450> we

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.600 
that's the teaching progression that we

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.960 
that's the teaching progression that we
really<00:05:04.870> like<00:05:05.080> to<00:05:05.260> use<00:05:05.290> with<00:05:06.160> our<00:05:06.190> players<00:05:06.640> we

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
really like to use with our players we

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.270 
really like to use with our players we
start<00:05:07.330> with<00:05:07.510> no<00:05:07.720> movement<00:05:08.020> just<00:05:08.680> the<00:05:08.800> basic

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
start with no movement just the basic

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.910 
start with no movement just the basic
fundamentals<00:05:09.940> of<00:05:10.180> the<00:05:10.810> footwork<00:05:11.230> itself<00:05:11.740> in

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:11.920 
fundamentals of the footwork itself in

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.430 
fundamentals of the footwork itself in
this<00:05:12.070> case<00:05:12.280> and<00:05:12.610> then<00:05:13.330> we<00:05:13.840> will<00:05:14.020> start<00:05:14.320> with

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
this case and then we will start with

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.160 
this case and then we will start with
just<00:05:14.770> a<00:05:14.950> two-step<00:05:15.460> backpedal<00:05:16.150> not<00:05:16.690> with<00:05:16.900> a<00:05:16.930> lot

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:17.170 
just a two-step backpedal not with a lot

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:21.630 
just a two-step backpedal not with a lot
of<00:05:17.200> speed<00:05:17.590> involved<00:05:17.950> and<00:05:19.380> then<00:05:20.380> we<00:05:21.160> take<00:05:21.460> the

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:21.640 
of speed involved and then we take the

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.520 
of speed involved and then we take the
next<00:05:21.880> step<00:05:22.090> from<00:05:22.300> them<00:05:22.480> would<00:05:22.660> be<00:05:22.690> a<00:05:22.810> five<00:05:23.170> step

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
next step from them would be a five step

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.620 
next step from them would be a five step
back<00:05:23.830> pedal<00:05:24.280> with<00:05:24.850> the<00:05:25.000> brake<00:05:25.210> and<00:05:25.240> drive

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:25.630 
back pedal with the brake and drive

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:26.940 
back pedal with the brake and drive
working<00:05:26.110> on<00:05:26.230> it<00:05:26.380> and<00:05:26.560> then<00:05:26.680> eventually

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:26.950 
working on it and then eventually

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:28.590 
working on it and then eventually
they'll<00:05:27.430> get<00:05:27.640> to<00:05:27.760> where<00:05:27.910> they'll<00:05:28.060> do<00:05:28.270> this<00:05:28.450> at

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:28.600 
they'll get to where they'll do this at

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.040 
they'll get to where they'll do this at
a<00:05:28.660> full<00:05:28.870> speed<00:05:30.030> the<00:05:31.030> importance<00:05:31.570> of<00:05:31.720> the<00:05:31.840> brake

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.050 
a full speed the importance of the brake

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.980 
a full speed the importance of the brake
and<00:05:32.080> drive<00:05:32.530> is<00:05:32.890> really<00:05:33.670> making<00:05:34.510> the<00:05:34.750> player

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
and drive is really making the player

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.290 
and drive is really making the player
not<00:05:35.260> making<00:05:35.620> the<00:05:35.740> play<00:05:35.980> if<00:05:36.280> you<00:05:36.760> don't<00:05:37.060> have

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300 
not making the play if you don't have

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.210 
not making the play if you don't have
this<00:05:37.540> drill<00:05:37.930> and<00:05:38.170> you<00:05:38.710> don't<00:05:38.890> have<00:05:39.040> this

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.220 
this drill and you don't have this

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:41.190 
this drill and you don't have this
technique<00:05:39.730> down<00:05:40.000> where<00:05:40.360> there's<00:05:40.570> no<00:05:40.720> wasted

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:41.200 
technique down where there's no wasted

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.580 
technique down where there's no wasted
steps<00:05:41.700> where<00:05:42.700> it's<00:05:43.060> quick<00:05:43.540> and<00:05:43.780> as<00:05:44.020> fast<00:05:44.350> as

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:44.590 
steps where it's quick and as fast as

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:46.770 
steps where it's quick and as fast as
you<00:05:44.740> can<00:05:44.890> possibly<00:05:45.100> make<00:05:45.640> it<00:05:45.820> coming<00:05:46.630> out<00:05:46.750> of

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 
you can possibly make it coming out of

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.540 
you can possibly make it coming out of
that<00:05:46.900> back<00:05:47.230> pedal<00:05:47.650> then<00:05:47.980> you're<00:05:48.160> not<00:05:48.280> going<00:05:48.490> to

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
that back pedal then you're not going to

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.970 
that back pedal then you're not going to
make<00:05:48.670> any<00:05:48.730> place<00:05:49.240> so<00:05:50.080> you<00:05:50.140> need<00:05:50.650> to<00:05:50.950> really

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:50.980 
make any place so you need to really

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.520 
make any place so you need to really
work<00:05:51.550> on<00:05:51.760> this<00:05:52.030> until<00:05:52.720> it<00:05:52.960> just<00:05:53.200> becomes

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:53.530 
work on this until it just becomes

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.290 
work on this until it just becomes
second<00:05:53.980> nature<00:05:54.010> to<00:05:54.310> you<00:05:54.490> and<00:05:54.760> it<00:05:54.880> takes<00:05:54.910> about

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:55.300 
second nature to you and it takes about

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.470 
second nature to you and it takes about
a<00:05:55.480> thousand<00:05:56.140> times<00:05:56.860> of<00:05:57.280> work<00:05:57.520> in<00:05:57.700> this<00:05:57.910> before

00:05:58.470 --> 00:05:58.480 
a thousand times of work in this before

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.810 
a thousand times of work in this before
it<00:05:58.570> becomes<00:05:58.960> second<00:05:59.890> nature<00:05:59.920> to<00:06:00.250> you<00:06:00.400> and<00:06:00.670> this

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:00.820 
it becomes second nature to you and this

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:02.640 
it becomes second nature to you and this
was<00:06:01.000> the<00:06:01.120> technique<00:06:01.540> that<00:06:01.750> you<00:06:02.020> that<00:06:02.260> you<00:06:02.320> have

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:02.650 
was the technique that you that you have

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.160 
was the technique that you that you have
in<00:06:02.770> your<00:06:02.920> game
