00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:21.509 
used correctly this is a tactic that

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:23.779 
used correctly this is a tactic that
works<00:00:21.779> for<00:00:21.960> any<00:00:22.169> faction<00:00:22.759> slingers<00:00:23.759> and

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789

arches<00:00:24.240> are<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.450> best<00:00:24.750> tropes<00:00:25.140> for<00:00:25.380> this

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
arches are the best tropes for this

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.859 
arches are the best tropes for this
because<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:25.949> their<00:00:26.039> range<00:00:26.369> but<00:00:27.329> even<00:00:27.630> lowly

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
because of their range but even lowly

because of their range but even lowly
javelin<00:00:28.619> troops<00:00:28.920> can<00:00:29.429> do<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.789> job<00:00:30.060> just<00:00:30.090> fine

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
javelin troops can do the job just fine

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.610 
javelin troops can do the job just fine
I'll<00:00:31.560> demonstrate<00:00:32.550> using<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.330> Subic<00:00:33.809> it's

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
I'll demonstrate using the Subic it's

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.430 
I'll demonstrate using the Subic it's
only<00:00:34.860> turned<00:00:35.280> 3<00:00:35.760> which<00:00:36.540> means<00:00:36.780> we<00:00:36.930> don't<00:00:37.230> yet

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
only turned 3 which means we don't yet

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.270 
only turned 3 which means we don't yet
have<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.860> tech<00:00:38.100> boost<00:00:38.489> for<00:00:38.879> extra<00:00:39.360> ammunition

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
have the tech boost for extra ammunition

have the tech boost for extra ammunition
now<00:00:41.280> ammunition<00:00:42.000> is<00:00:42.120> going<00:00:42.269> to<00:00:42.329> be<00:00:42.420> pretty

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
now ammunition is going to be pretty

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.500 
now ammunition is going to be pretty
tight<00:00:43.019> but<00:00:43.620> that's<00:00:43.829> ok<00:00:44.220> I've<00:00:44.430> picked<00:00:45.299> up<00:00:45.390> a

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.730 
having your missile troops in two ranks
is<00:01:05.790> quite<00:01:06.060> useful<00:01:06.570> if<00:01:07.200> you're<00:01:07.500> getting

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
is quite useful if you're getting

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.340 
is quite useful if you're getting
charged<00:01:08.220> by<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.520> enemy<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.570> front<00:01:09.900> rank<00:01:10.140> can

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
troops as possible so always err on the

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.080 
troops as possible so always err on the
side<00:02:22.529> of<00:02:22.590> caution

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.729 
side of caution
the<00:02:24.300> one<00:02:24.510> thing<00:02:24.720> that<00:02:24.780> we<00:02:24.989> really<00:02:25.440> have<00:02:25.590> to

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
the one thing that we really have to

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.690 
the one thing that we really have to
look<00:02:25.860> out<00:02:26.099> for<00:02:26.310> is<00:02:26.489> missile<00:02:27.300> troops<00:02:28.400> in<00:02:29.400> tip

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
troops as quickly as possible so

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:14.960

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
remember to use your quick reload

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.160 
remember to use your quick reload
ability<00:03:16.670> when<00:03:17.670> missile<00:03:18.090> units<00:03:18.569> run<00:03:18.870> out<00:03:19.019> of

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
ability when missile units run out of

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.830 
ability when missile units run out of
ammunition<00:03:19.470> I<00:03:20.030> switched<00:03:21.030> into<00:03:21.209> a<00:03:21.360> separate

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
ammunition I switched into a separate

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.370 
ammunition I switched into a separate
group<00:03:22.080> I<00:03:22.410> use<00:03:23.250> number<00:03:23.519> nine<00:03:23.780> and<00:03:24.780> move<00:03:25.110> them

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
group I use number nine and move them

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.479 
group I use number nine and move them
out<00:03:25.530> of<00:03:25.590> harm's<00:03:25.950> way<00:03:27.320> now<00:03:28.320> I<00:03:28.590> almost<00:03:28.769> messed<00:03:29.280> up

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
out of harm's way now I almost messed up

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.080 
out of harm's way now I almost messed up
big<00:03:29.880> time<00:03:29.910> in<00:03:30.420> this<00:03:30.570> battle<00:03:31.019> I<00:03:31.820> moved<00:03:32.820> forward

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
big time in this battle I moved forward

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.210 
big time in this battle I moved forward
thinking<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:33.959> remaining<00:03:34.470> units<00:03:34.680> would<00:03:35.070> be

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
thinking the remaining units would be

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.470 
thinking the remaining units would be
near<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.549> victory<00:03:35.910> point<00:03:36.200> and<00:03:38.299> instead<00:03:39.299> they

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
near the victory point and instead they

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.610 
near the victory point and instead they
were<00:03:39.540> behind<00:03:40.019> me<00:03:41.209> but<00:03:42.209> I<00:03:42.269> just<00:03:42.470> managed<00:03:43.470> to

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
were behind me but I just managed to

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.059 
were behind me but I just managed to
pull<00:03:43.799> the<00:03:43.950> troops<00:03:44.220> out<00:03:45.319> one<00:03:46.319> unit<00:03:46.560> did<00:03:46.859> get

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
pull the troops out one unit did get

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.020 
pull the troops out one unit did get
caught<00:03:47.310> and<00:03:47.459> I<00:03:47.519> lost<00:03:47.790> about<00:03:47.940> fifty<00:03:48.450> men

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
caught and I lost about fifty men

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.960 
caught and I lost about fifty men
eventually<00:03:51.030> I<00:03:51.510> ran<00:03:51.959> out<00:03:52.109> of<00:03:52.140> ammunition<00:03:52.470> and<00:03:52.970> I

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
eventually I ran out of ammunition and I

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.340 
eventually I ran out of ammunition and I
had<00:03:54.090> to<00:03:54.209> finish<00:03:54.389> off<00:03:54.600> for<00:03:54.630> the<00:03:54.780> last<00:03:54.900> couple<00:03:55.139> of
