move<00:04:09.330> forward<00:04:09.660> or<00:04:09.810> backward<00:04:09.840> like<00:04:10.260> it<00:04:10.440> should

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
move forward or backward like it should

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.590 
move forward or backward like it should
because<00:04:10.950> the<00:04:11.130> one<00:04:11.280> tires<00:04:11.610> or<00:04:12.270> two<00:04:12.420> of<00:04:12.510> the

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
because the one tires or two of the

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.090 
because the one tires or two of the
tires<00:04:12.810> are<00:04:13.050> flat<00:04:13.140> but<00:04:13.530> hopefully<00:04:13.830> we<00:04:13.920> can<00:04:14.010> get

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
tires are flat but hopefully we can get

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.039 
tires are flat but hopefully we can get
it<00:04:14.220> to<00:04:14.340> show<00:04:15.270> you<00:04:15.330> that<00:04:15.420> the<00:04:15.630> transmission

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
it to show you that the transmission

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:22.939 
it to show you that the transmission
does<00:04:16.350> engage<00:04:16.650> and

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:22.949 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:30.400 

and<00:04:23.490> we'll<00:04:23.639> go<00:04:23.729> backward

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.860 

so<00:04:31.010> if<00:04:31.100> you<00:04:31.190> need<00:04:31.310> any<00:04:31.430> parts<00:04:31.730> for<00:04:31.870> 2004
