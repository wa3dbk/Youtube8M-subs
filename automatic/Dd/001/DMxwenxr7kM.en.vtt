00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.390 
do that gaming is the primary focus of
this<00:00:13.259> build<00:00:13.530> but<00:00:13.650> I<00:00:13.740> wanted<00:00:13.980> to<00:00:14.040> make<00:00:14.160> sure<00:00:14.219> I

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
this build but I wanted to make sure I

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.490 
this build but I wanted to make sure I
get<00:00:14.549> some<00:00:14.820> parts<00:00:15.000> in<00:00:15.179> there<00:00:15.330> that<00:00:15.780> lets<00:00:15.960> you<00:00:16.199> do

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
get some parts in there that lets you do

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.050 
get some parts in there that lets you do
other<00:00:16.710> things<00:00:16.830> as<00:00:17.250> well<00:00:17.279> starting<00:00:17.789> off<00:00:17.940> with

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
other things as well starting off with

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.380 
other things as well starting off with
the<00:00:18.180> CPU<00:00:18.600> I<00:00:18.630> will<00:00:18.900> at<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.050> AMD<00:00:19.439> FX<00:00:19.830> 6300<00:00:20.390> 3.5

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
the CPU I will at the AMD FX 6300 3.5

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.150 
the CPU I will at the AMD FX 6300 3.5
gigahertz<00:00:21.720> six<00:00:22.140> core<00:00:22.380> processor<00:00:23.010> now

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
gigahertz six core processor now

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.740 
gigahertz six core processor now
originally<00:00:23.699> I<00:00:23.730> was<00:00:23.910> thinking<00:00:24.330> about<00:00:24.449> fitting

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
originally I was thinking about fitting

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.130 
originally I was thinking about fitting
in<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:25.080> intel<00:00:25.740> core<00:00:26.010> i5<00:00:26.160> 4670k<00:00:27.019> into<00:00:28.019> this

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
in and intel core i5 4670k into this

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.599 
in and intel core i5 4670k into this
building<00:00:28.529> going<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.890> intel<00:00:29.250> route<00:00:29.429> instead

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
building going the intel route instead

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.269 
building going the intel route instead
of<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.060> AMD<00:00:30.510> route<00:00:30.779> but<00:00:31.590> it<00:00:31.679> just<00:00:31.859> made<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.070> lot

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
of the AMD route but it just made a lot

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.920 
of the AMD route but it just made a lot
more<00:00:32.309> sense<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.940> save<00:00:33.180> that<00:00:33.360> hundred<00:00:33.660> dollars

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
more sense to save that hundred dollars

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.990 
more sense to save that hundred dollars
kind<00:00:34.350> of<00:00:34.469> take<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.710> hit<00:00:34.980> on<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.219> cpu<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:35.850> put

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
kind of take a hit on the cpu and put

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.240 
kind of take a hit on the cpu and put
that<00:00:36.149> towards<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.719> GP<00:00:37.050> but<00:00:37.200> FX<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.680> 300<00:00:38.160> is

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
that towards the GP but FX is 300 is

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.310 
that towards the GP but FX is 300 is
still<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.460> great<00:00:38.670> CPU<00:00:38.969> at<00:00:39.629> three<00:00:39.989> point<00:00:40.200> five

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
still a great CPU at three point five

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.930 
still a great CPU at three point five
gigahertz<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:41.010> only<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.280> hundred<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.790> eight

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
gigahertz and only a hundred and eight

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.700 
gigahertz and only a hundred and eight
dollars<00:00:42.390> right<00:00:42.600> now<00:00:42.719> it's<00:00:42.930> just<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.200> great<00:00:43.440> deal

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
dollars right now it's just a great deal

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.260 
dollars right now it's just a great deal
and<00:00:44.129> this<00:00:44.280> is<00:00:44.430> really<00:00:44.610> good<00:00:44.850> for<00:00:45.000> video

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
and this is really good for video

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.990 
and this is really good for video
editing<00:00:45.480> because<00:00:45.930> uh<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.559> is<00:00:47.190> six<00:00:47.520> physical

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
editing because uh it is six physical

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.580 
editing because uh it is six physical
cores<00:00:48.270> which<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.600> better<00:00:48.780> than<00:00:49.020> something

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
cores which is better than something

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.619 
cores which is better than something
like<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.920> i3<00:00:50.460> where<00:00:50.700> it's<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:50.910> dual<00:00:51.120> core<00:00:51.420> and

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
like the i3 where it's a dual core and

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.779 
like the i3 where it's a dual core and
it's<00:00:51.780> hyper<00:00:51.989> threaded<00:00:52.469> six<00:00:53.160> physical<00:00:53.550> cores

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
it's hyper threaded six physical cores

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.580 
it's hyper threaded six physical cores
is<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:53.969> lot<00:00:54.210> better<00:00:54.449> than<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:54.870> especially

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
is a lot better than that especially

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.869 
is a lot better than that especially
when<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.129> comes<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.370> things<00:00:56.520> like<00:00:56.640> video

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
when it comes to things like video

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.490 
when it comes to things like video
editing<00:00:57.420> live<00:00:57.600> streaming<00:00:57.930> things<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.350> that

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
editing live streaming things of that

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.590 
editing live streaming things of that
nature<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.920> FX<00:00:59.190> is<00:00:59.340> 300<00:00:59.820> definitely<00:01:00.239> excels

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
nature the FX is 300 definitely excels

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.930 
nature the FX is 300 definitely excels
at<00:01:00.809> for<00:01:01.230> its<00:01:01.350> price<00:01:01.500> point<00:01:01.829> yeah<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.640> i

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
at for its price point yeah and i

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.399 
at for its price point yeah and i
thought<00:01:03.090> this<00:01:03.149> just<00:01:03.539> made<00:01:03.719> logical<00:01:04.170> sense

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
thought this just made logical sense

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.679 
thought this just made logical sense
it's<00:01:04.559> 108<00:01:05.159> bucks<00:01:05.430> not<00:01:05.640> too<00:01:05.939> expensive<00:01:06.299> and

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
it's 108 bucks not too expensive and

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.480 
it's 108 bucks not too expensive and
this<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.110> going<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.290> allow<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.500> put<00:01:07.799> us<00:01:07.890> off<00:01:08.159> for

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
this is going to allow to put us off for

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.429 
this is going to allow to put us off for
us<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.820> put<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:08.970> lot<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.240> money<00:01:09.390> towards<00:01:09.930> that<00:01:10.020> GP

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
us to put a lot of money towards that GP

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.469 
us to put a lot of money towards that GP
which<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:10.950> crux<00:01:11.159> of<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.520> gaming<00:01:11.820> pc<00:01:12.180> build
