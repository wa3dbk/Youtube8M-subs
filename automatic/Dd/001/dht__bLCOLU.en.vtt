00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
that I got is the curl Jam set but it

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.600 
that I got is the curl Jam set but it
looks<00:00:58.200> just<00:00:58.320> like<00:00:58.590> this<00:00:58.890> so<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.130> comes<00:00:59.370> in<00:00:59.550> a

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
looks just like this so it comes in a

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.069 
looks just like this so it comes in a
bundle<00:01:00.320> when<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.680> opens<00:01:01.980> up<00:01:02.220> like<00:01:02.520> so<00:01:03.210> the

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:04.079 
bundle when it opens up like so the

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:07.760 
bundle when it opens up like so the
handle<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.829> this<00:01:05.840> this<00:01:06.840> barrel<00:01:07.170> specifically

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
handle and this this barrel specifically

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.320 
handle and this this barrel specifically
goes<00:01:08.010> right<00:01:08.400> in<00:01:08.520> these<00:01:08.670> two<00:01:08.880> thoughts<00:01:09.090> which

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
goes right in these two thoughts which

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.840 
goes right in these two thoughts which
is<00:01:09.450> why<00:01:09.600> it's<00:01:09.720> empty<00:01:10.070> but<00:01:11.070> anyway<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:11.370> those<00:01:11.670> go

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
is why it's empty but anyway so those go

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.850 
is why it's empty but anyway so those go
there<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.330> then<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.540> get<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.720> other<00:01:13.170> sizes<00:01:13.560> as

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
there and then you get to other sizes as

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.280 
there and then you get to other sizes as
well<00:01:13.890> you<00:01:14.310> get<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:15.120> smallest<00:01:15.450> size<00:01:15.840> so<00:01:16.140> this

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
well you get the smallest size so this

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.890 
well you get the smallest size so this
is<00:01:16.409> more<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.620> like<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:17.040> medium<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.729> then<00:01:18.630> this

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
is more of like the medium and then this

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.930 
is more of like the medium and then this
is<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.560> teeny<00:01:20.430> teeny<00:01:20.700> tiny<00:01:20.970> one<00:01:22.610> and<00:01:23.610> then<00:01:23.820> it

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:23.940 
is the teeny teeny tiny one and then it

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.580 
is the teeny teeny tiny one and then it
also<00:01:24.090> comes<00:01:24.479> with<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.750> straightener<00:01:25.229> which<00:01:25.440> i

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
also comes with a straightener which i

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.880 
also comes with a straightener which i
think<00:01:25.650> is<00:01:27.080> fantastical<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.320> i<00:01:28.350> use<00:01:28.680> the

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
think is fantastical that i use the

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.710 
think is fantastical that i use the
largest<00:01:29.370> barrel<00:01:29.760> which<00:01:29.880> i<00:01:30.030> mentioned<00:01:30.240> in<00:01:30.690> my

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
largest barrel which i mentioned in my

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.270 
largest barrel which i mentioned in my
current<00:01:31.020> favorites<00:01:31.560> video<00:01:31.799> which<00:01:32.040> if<00:01:32.190> you

haven't seen aha that link down in the

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.960 
haven't seen aha that link down in the
description<00:01:34.020> box<00:01:34.590> for<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:34.950> guys<00:01:35.100> but<00:01:35.729> this<00:01:35.909> is

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
description box for you guys but this is

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.600 
description box for you guys but this is
the<00:01:36.210> three-in-one<00:01:36.630> curling<00:01:37.260> wand<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.830> i<00:01:38.340> use

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
the three-in-one curling wand and i use

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.840 
the three-in-one curling wand and i use
the<00:01:38.820> largest<00:01:39.299> size<00:01:39.540> that<00:01:39.930> comes<00:01:40.140> in<00:01:40.350> this<00:01:40.500> set

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
the largest size that comes in this set

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.039 
the largest size that comes in this set
and<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.150> reason<00:01:42.360> why<00:01:42.450> i<00:01:42.479> like<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.810> largest

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
and the reason why i like the largest

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.990 
and the reason why i like the largest
size<00:01:43.260> is<00:01:43.440> because<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:44.159> gives<00:01:44.400> a<00:01:44.580> much<00:01:44.760> more

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
size is because it gives a much more

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.770 
size is because it gives a much more
effortless<00:01:45.720> not<00:01:46.710> very<00:01:47.010> uniform<00:01:47.700> look<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.210> your

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
effortless not very uniform look to your

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.649 
effortless not very uniform look to your
hair<00:01:49.049> it<00:01:49.290> just<00:01:49.619> looks<00:01:50.100> so<00:01:50.430> nice<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.630> just

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
hair it just looks so nice and I just

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.160 
hair it just looks so nice and I just
love<00:01:52.080> the<00:01:52.229> way<00:01:52.260> it<00:01:52.950> sort<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:53.880> flows<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.810> doesn't

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170
