00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.470
 hello very good to all and for the one of 

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:04.879
 parties are one more chapter of happy 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.640
 girls and let's see what we find 

00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:09.050
 in the most voted today and I have not even 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.760
 fixed in the title I do not know what it is 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:14.150
 surely the first ones tend to be 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:17.320
 comic strips of these generally and not 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.320
 I know very well what I'm doing 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.760
 over 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:26.370
 I do not like it at all I do not know 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.010
 because I'm not sure what's going on 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.360
 so once lost team and is supposed to 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.580
 you have to go up there and that 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:37.170
 shoot me but of course if I run out 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:38.640
 force come let's go there let's go this is 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.130
 impossible to watch quito because this does not 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.710
 is nothing like this map in order 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:48.600
 we continue to forget this this minute 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.850
 of video and we're going to play basketball 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.960
 to see if the agreement is supposed to be 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.170
 place or not 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.710
 I never was really good at the truth 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.710
 although I liked it 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:06.080
 perfect mother of mine but I am and was 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:09.060
 I will take the victory if not head 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.330
 perfect I had a little bit burst but 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.590
 well we start well if we forget what 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.140
 first clear 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.880
 I've seen around here a rock swing had 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.220
 seen but I just lost it not 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:25.560
 crystal breaker I do not like that it is 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:28.110
 rock swing 40 451 z good good good 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.050
 with that name it seems he left area 51 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.060
 wow they come threads or not no I'm not 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:37.679
 fool I can not believe it or it is not 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.869
 I can not hold on and I almost get 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:43.049
 leave or be a way to throw but 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.429
 no no because I'm that bad now here 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.459
 we have one that merlo in a little bit the 

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:49.080
 knee but this we lower the speed 

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:51.090
 Look, my arms are broken 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.650
 because and the head why why 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.630
 because if 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.510
 Anyway let's play again again 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.520
 I do not know why they have dismembered me 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:03.480
 I understand it male 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:06.690
 around here look perfect and say come on 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.100
 we are perfect that I fall that I fall and there 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.050
 we have this what had to be 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.850
 happened before but it has not worked in 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.510
 end is what we have now perfect 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.250
 slowly 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.500
 and I break my head but that's 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.450
 impossible, you think that it goes head on and 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.790
 bust we're going to try again for 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.150
 last time if it 's okay we have a 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.640
 little bit of luck to this around here 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:32.799
 perfect we throw ourselves slowly with 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:35.920
 iron and there we have it perfect and has 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:37.540
 I've been very fair almost I'm starting again 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.700
 the head but good man who wore the 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.409
 helmet although it protects me almost nothing in 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.829
 end and we continue here that do not occur 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:46.390
 of noses carries this that does not lead to 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:48.730
 no side to victory but no 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.940
 there is platform or anything but good 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.930
 we continue by bottle run long and 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:59.040
 see if it is long or not 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.040
 the leg of emotion 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:07.720
 to victory little was so complicated nor 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:11.049
 so long is 90% impossible 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.360
 we will go we will check if really 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:16.450
 it is as impossible as it says and we 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.819
 we release do not know why I wanted to fly 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.519
 through the air happens and sometimes I say 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:24.370
 well I want to burst you let go 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:27.640
 this can not be here but if I 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:30.040
 remained to nothing will be eaten played is that 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.349
 I'm pricked and on three sides it's worth we go back 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.980
 to try again we try again 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:37.069
 all right 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.930
 with a jury and the mine the mine was 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:40.879
 What is happening is that the mine 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.150
 wants to exploit, it's worth that for now 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:45.830
 I remove it from half come and continue not 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.319
 I can believe it if he killed me 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.239
 in the air 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:53.180
 Let's see, let's try again here 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:56.299
 we have it perfect and we exploit hope 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.830
 that we have left alive but if that 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:00.099
 shut up in the damn victory but if it's 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:04.010
 that the explosion was done 

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:05.599
 but I did not have to prick me the most 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.750
 curious is that to which I exploited the 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:12.110
 ass 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:12.110
 well finally we try again 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.480
 clicking on everything see if this is not 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.480
 there are those who believe 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:26.500
 to which I hope I'm still alive 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:28.150
 eye we have it here and we are fatal 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:32.830
 well come, come, come to the third 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:34.720
 is the expired 'web or do not you know I'll do the 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.460
 third exploited bullet not defeated 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.940
 let's try it for the last time that I 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.940
 is already putting 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:45.970
 let's follow another sword thrower 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:49.470
 because they are not being like the levels 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:52.540
 as very difficult to remove with the feet 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:54.220
 today to resume value another or not is that 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:56.830
 I do not like it when there are so many swords 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.300
 because you can not catch well worth 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.220
 this here perfect when and little 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.320
 it's like easier to grab all 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.450
 we already have the one who was doing a 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.070
 little bit of yoga and now to kill this 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:09.260
 two letters 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:14.610
 I said to kill these two from behind 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:16.830
 good to win we go what things you have 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.630
 we go to the menu and see if you can 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.580
 survive can survive 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:23.160
 I can survive too many balls 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:27.570
 too many balls hey hey he's not going to 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:29.670
 kill and is up but you have not seen 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:33.000
 so head gives you as a return to 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:36.060
 this is a common yoyo within me 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.610
 own of my own body a rock swing 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:41.940
 to see how we are given this almost does not 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:43.230
 go and hear look for having this is 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.150
 being fatal I do not know what the 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:48.540
 given as a tremendous wash but now 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:50.430
 let's try again and now 

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:53.970
 perfect is how very finite it is broken and 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:55.470
 it does not seem to me that one was 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.480
 increased while not having too much 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.050
 force just breaking me things gives me 

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:02.520
 same 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:04.620
 there we have it and facing towards Asia 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.180
 that I was left and I was not seeing 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:09.030
 come I say it stays the head hooked 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:11.490
 and this he did not name it 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:15.150
 I 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:18.440
 as is possible this is only possible in 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:21.260
 end let's go back to continue 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:23.810
 impossible totally impossible 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:25.960
 [Music] 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:28.930
 or not 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:31.360
 to see what it said that 0% was impossible 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.860
 whatever is possible we will see everything 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.649
 contrary 

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:37.389
 with this 

00:06:34.649 --> 00:06:40.800
 this this smells like they 're going to click 

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:43.360
 I clicked for 800,000 sides but how many 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.420
 there are lots of harpoons there because 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:48.770
 they have not stopped shooting me 

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:48.770
 and here we have it we let go 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:55.319
 it's complicated it's complicated that 

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:55.319
 come, come, come, come 

00:06:55.409 --> 00:07:00.629
 in stadiums be it but because it explodes me or 

00:06:57.419 --> 00:07:03.029
 that is that every time do the levels 

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:05.219
 very complex is worth this prick a 

00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:09.020
 I thought a little bit about what 

00:07:05.219 --> 00:07:11.180
 comes the kidney but nothing happens 

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:14.240
 or it happens to me that if you leaned my nose 

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:16.160
 against the mine because I want to read it 

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.930
 is already the best you know things of those that 

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.909
 they are happening sometimes to the one that 

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:21.259
 We have no I can not believe it I'm 

00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:24.099
 split in half totally but 

00:07:21.259 --> 00:07:27.220
 I 'm still alive I could still win 

00:07:24.099 --> 00:07:27.220
 or not
