just cut pieces that are about a
centimeter<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:19.100> width<00:01:20.100> so<00:01:20.940> centimeter<00:01:21.510> is

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
centimeter and width so centimeter is

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.920 
centimeter and width so centimeter is
about<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.740> quarter<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.340> an<00:01:23.430> inch<00:01:23.580> English<00:01:26.930> so
