knitting is how much yarn do I need to
cast<00:00:14.519> on<00:00:14.849> and<00:00:15.529> this<00:00:16.529> can<00:00:16.920> be<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.039> little

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
cast on and this can be a little

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.910 
cast on and this can be a little
frustrating<00:00:18.090> if<00:00:18.300> you<00:00:19.020> keep<00:00:19.289> trying<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.680> cast

frustrating if you keep trying to cast

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.230 
frustrating if you keep trying to cast
on<00:00:20.189> you<00:00:20.369> always<00:00:20.789> turn<00:00:20.970> up<00:00:21.029> short<00:00:22.730> the<00:00:23.730> simplest

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
on you always turn up short the simplest

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.599 
on you always turn up short the simplest
way<00:00:24.570> to<00:00:24.600> fix<00:00:25.289> that<00:00:25.560> if<00:00:25.800> you<00:00:25.980> keep<00:00:26.189> coming<00:00:26.400> up

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
way to fix that if you keep coming up

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.880 
way to fix that if you keep coming up
short<00:00:26.910> is<00:00:27.060> just<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.480> do<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.810> knit<00:00:28.080> on<00:00:28.260> cast<00:00:28.890> on

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
short is just to do the knit on cast on

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.740 
short is just to do the knit on cast on
so<00:00:31.890> you<00:00:31.949> just<00:00:32.309> make<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:32.940> slipknot<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:35.630> then<00:00:36.630> you

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
so you just make a slipknot and then you

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:44.060 
so you just make a slipknot and then you
just<00:00:37.700> knit<00:00:38.700> your<00:00:38.940> stitches<00:00:39.450> on<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:43.070> actually

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
just knit your stitches on I actually

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.950 
just knit your stitches on I actually
like<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.700> way<00:00:44.730> it<00:00:44.910> looks<00:00:45.090> when<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.360> purl<00:00:45.690> them

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
like the way it looks when you purl them

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.400 
like the way it looks when you purl them
on<00:00:46.309> but<00:00:47.309> you<00:00:47.460> can<00:00:47.640> do<00:00:47.760> them<00:00:47.910> either<00:00:48.120> way<00:00:48.450> it's

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
on but you can do them either way it's

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.250 
on but you can do them either way it's
just<00:00:49.770> as<00:00:49.920> if<00:00:50.100> you're<00:00:50.430> working<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.390> stitch<00:00:51.930> and

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
just as if you're working a stitch and

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.619 
just as if you're working a stitch and
you<00:00:52.800> just<00:00:53.329> purl<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:55.250> place<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.610> stitch<00:00:56.910> back

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
you just purl and place the stitch back

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.369 
you just purl and place the stitch back
onto<00:00:57.930> your<00:00:58.170> left<00:00:58.260> needle<00:00:58.739> and<00:01:00.079> that<00:01:01.079> way<00:01:01.320> you

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
onto your left needle and that way you

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.830 
onto your left needle and that way you
can<00:01:01.770> ensure<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:02.969> won't<00:01:03.270> run<00:01:03.660> out<00:01:03.690> of

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
can ensure that you won't run out of

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.469 
can ensure that you won't run out of
yarn<00:01:04.170> because<00:01:04.890> you're<00:01:05.400> knitting<00:01:05.700> them<00:01:06.030> as<00:01:06.270> you

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
yarn because you're knitting them as you

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.550 
yarn because you're knitting them as you
go<00:01:08.150> so<00:01:09.150> that's<00:01:09.330> one<00:01:09.600> way<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.840> make<00:01:10.080> sure<00:01:10.380> that

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
go so that's one way to make sure that

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.450 
go so that's one way to make sure that
you're<00:01:10.830> never<00:01:11.100> short<00:01:11.580> yarn<00:01:12.950> another<00:01:13.950> method

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
you're never short yarn another method

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.609 
you're never short yarn another method
is<00:01:14.610> you<00:01:15.330> take<00:01:15.600> your<00:01:15.780> needle<00:01:16.229> that<00:01:16.409> you're

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
is you take your needle that you're

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.730 
is you take your needle that you're
working<00:01:16.830> with<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.520> your<00:01:18.090> yarn<00:01:18.390> leave<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.320> small

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
working with and your yarn leave a small

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.649 
working with and your yarn leave a small
tail<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:21.500> wrap<00:01:22.500> your<00:01:22.830> yarn<00:01:23.030> around<00:01:24.030> your

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
tail and wrap your yarn around your

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.289 
tail and wrap your yarn around your
needle<00:01:25.159> this<00:01:26.159> would<00:01:26.400> be<00:01:26.490> forming<00:01:27.060> your

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
needle this would be forming your

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.410 
needle this would be forming your
stitches<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.170> this<00:01:29.130> gives<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.670> an<00:01:29.820> estimate

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
stitches and this gives you an estimate

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.450 
stitches and this gives you an estimate
of<00:01:30.600> how<00:01:30.689> much<00:01:31.110> yarn<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:31.740> need<00:01:31.979> for<00:01:32.310> that

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
of how much yarn you need for that

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.490 
of how much yarn you need for that
particular<00:01:32.670> amount<00:01:33.390> of<00:01:33.659> stitches<00:01:36.259> so<00:01:37.259> then

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
particular amount of stitches so then

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.580 
particular amount of stitches so then
you've<00:01:38.400> wrapped<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:38.850> sixteen<00:01:39.390> times<00:01:39.560> so<00:01:40.560> now

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
you've wrapped it sixteen times so now

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.179 
you've wrapped it sixteen times so now
you<00:01:40.770> hold<00:01:41.220> here<00:01:41.549> where<00:01:41.759> you've<00:01:41.939> run<00:01:42.210> out<00:01:43.189> you

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
you hold here where you've run out you

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.740 
you hold here where you've run out you
let<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.610> go<00:01:46.159> and<00:01:47.159> at<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:47.970> place<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.360> either

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
let it go and at that place you either

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.560 
let it go and at that place you either
make<00:01:48.990> your<00:01:49.110> Slipknot<00:01:49.439> or<00:01:49.950> start<00:01:50.729> casting<00:01:51.030> on

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
make your Slipknot or start casting on

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.200 
make your Slipknot or start casting on
and<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:52.560> should<00:01:52.799> be<00:01:52.920> enough<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.640> cast<00:01:53.880> on

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
and that should be enough to cast on

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:12.870 
and that should be enough to cast on
your<00:01:54.450> 16<00:01:55.049> stitches

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.330 

so<00:02:13.480> there<00:02:13.690> we<00:02:13.810> have<00:02:14.080> our<00:02:14.110> sixteen<00:02:14.950> stitches

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
so there we have our sixteen stitches

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.630 
so there we have our sixteen stitches
and<00:02:15.940> we<00:02:16.540> have<00:02:16.750> our<00:02:16.960> tail<00:02:17.230> left<00:02:17.560> over<00:02:20.640> another

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
and we have our tail left over another

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.660 
and we have our tail left over another
method<00:02:22.480> that<00:02:22.510> you<00:02:22.930> can<00:02:23.140> do<00:02:23.440> is<00:02:23.710> for<00:02:24.520> every

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
method that you can do is for every

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.370 
method that you can do is for every
stitch<00:02:25.450> that<00:02:26.050> you<00:02:26.380> want<00:02:26.740> you<00:02:27.520> take<00:02:28.120> a<00:02:28.300> inch<00:02:29.080> of

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
stitch that you want you take a inch of

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.800 
stitch that you want you take a inch of
yarn<00:02:30.840> so<00:02:31.840> if<00:02:31.960> you<00:02:32.110> want<00:02:32.760> ten<00:02:33.760> stitches<00:02:34.150> we're

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
yarn so if you want ten stitches we're

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.960 
yarn so if you want ten stitches we're
gonna<00:02:34.930> do<00:02:35.110> ten<00:02:35.500> inches<00:02:35.890> of<00:02:35.950> yarn<00:02:38.610> so<00:02:39.610> you<00:02:39.670> just

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
gonna do ten inches of yarn so you just

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:49.500 
gonna do ten inches of yarn so you just
line<00:02:40.840> it<00:02:40.870> up<00:02:41.140> and<00:02:41.820> you<00:02:43.260> get<00:02:45.840> ten<00:02:46.840> inches<00:02:48.510> then

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
line it up and you get ten inches then

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.630 
line it up and you get ten inches then
at<00:02:49.690> that<00:02:49.870> point<00:02:50.200> again<00:02:50.500> you're<00:02:51.190> just<00:02:51.400> going<00:02:51.610> to

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
at that point again you're just going to

00:02:51.640 --> 00:03:05.110 
at that point again you're just going to
continue<00:02:52.210> with<00:02:52.330> your<00:02:52.510> cast<00:02:52.810> on

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.110 

and<00:03:05.660> now<00:03:05.810> we<00:03:05.870> have<00:03:06.230> our<00:03:06.500> 10<00:03:06.890> stitches<00:03:07.310> cast<00:03:07.819> on

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
and now we have our 10 stitches cast on

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.210 
and now we have our 10 stitches cast on
with<00:03:08.599> our<00:03:08.750> small<00:03:09.110> tail<00:03:09.440> that<00:03:09.620> we<00:03:09.739> started<00:03:10.069> out

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
with our small tail that we started out

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.970 
with our small tail that we started out
with<00:03:10.250> and<00:03:10.700> we<00:03:11.209> had<00:03:11.360> enough<00:03:11.660> yarn<00:03:12.560> for<00:03:12.890> our

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
with and we had enough yarn for our

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.119 
with and we had enough yarn for our
stitches<00:03:14.200> so<00:03:15.200> those<00:03:15.379> are<00:03:15.530> some<00:03:15.739> simple

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:16.129 
stitches so those are some simple
