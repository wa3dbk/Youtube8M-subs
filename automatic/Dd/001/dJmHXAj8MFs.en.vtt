00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:03.480
 I'm 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.900
 streaming 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.439
 Mediaset 

00:00:08.439 --> 00:00:10.190
 dear friends good morning 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.630
 today I will show you how to set up your easter table we will realize 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.230
 therefore the most important element of decoration is our table 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.449
 centerpiece 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.800
 we use a sponge of horsens that we will remain completely with branches of 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.279
 pitosforo that made me 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:29.829
 when we have completely covered our base with verbs we will pass to the 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:31.289
 floral arrangement 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.630
 in this case I chose lisianthus violaciocca tulips two shades i 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:39.420
 hyacinths we begin with the lilac tulips that we are going to insert in a manner 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.840
 the idea is random to create a sort of small flower garden after i 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.120
 tulips we use invisi altus 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.120
 let's proceed with and violaciocca 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.080
 I see in the moment of hyacinths that in this case we have chosen two 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.840
 tone 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.560
 I what in Libya 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.480
 at this point, after creating our composition of greens and flowers 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.480
 we will insert the bleached wood branches 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.560
 at this point we just have to pass people with chocolate eggs 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.660
 to fix them to the branches of our tree we should wrap our chest link 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.770
 in the transparent film in this way we will read it with a ribbon 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.850
 we will remove the excess plastic 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.759
 once all our reptiles are packaged we will hang them up 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.490
 at this point, like any self-respecting lawn, the bunny cannot miss 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.680
 corbani that we will place right in the middle of our composition 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.960
 However 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.259
 we have therefore created a real flowery meadow 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:50.569
 here is my mac tv the inter is our bunny with ubuntu
