00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
the end which seeing how I didn't use

the end which seeing how I didn't use
clay<00:00:58.289> or<00:00:58.469> anything<00:00:59.010> came<00:00:59.969> out<00:01:00.120> pretty<00:01:00.239> good

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
clay or anything came out pretty good

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.280 
clay or anything came out pretty good
because<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:01.050> shaved<00:01:01.469> off<00:01:01.770> but<00:01:02.550> then<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:03.229> it<00:01:04.229> was

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
because I shaved off but then and it was

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.230 
because I shaved off but then and it was
like<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.500> mess<00:01:04.860> up<00:01:05.040> helmet<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:05.670> decided<00:01:06.090> to

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
like a mess up helmet so I decided to

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.330 
like a mess up helmet so I decided to
make<00:01:06.420> this<00:01:07.369> um<00:01:08.990> if<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.140> get<00:01:10.320> enough<00:01:10.619> views<00:01:11.010> for

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
make this um if I get enough views for

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.149

it<00:01:11.490> i'll<00:01:11.640> show<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.000> how<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.390> make<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:13.020> but<00:01:13.860> i

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159
