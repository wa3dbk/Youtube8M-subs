it's<00:00:11.110> really<00:00:11.290> easy<00:00:11.530> to<00:00:11.680> make<00:00:11.830> this<00:00:12.520> is<00:00:12.730> the

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:12.880 
it's really easy to make this is the

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.670 
it's really easy to make this is the
front<00:00:13.210> and<00:00:13.480> she's<00:00:13.900> flow

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:17.680 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.470 

start<00:00:18.680> off<00:00:18.890> by<00:00:19.160> using<00:00:19.400> a<00:00:19.640> large<00:00:19.970> piece<00:00:20.300> of

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
start off by using a large piece of

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.170 
start off by using a large piece of
fabric<00:00:21.100> probably<00:00:22.100> around<00:00:22.250> three<00:00:22.700> quarters<00:00:22.730> of

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
fabric probably around three quarters of

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.590 
fabric probably around three quarters of
a<00:00:23.300> yard<00:00:23.330> using<00:00:24.290> a<00:00:24.730> fabric<00:00:25.730> of<00:00:25.880> your<00:00:25.910> choice<00:00:26.060> in

a yard using a fabric of your choice in
any<00:00:26.779> material<00:00:27.590> or<00:00:27.770> any<00:00:28.100> color<00:00:28.779> then<00:00:29.779> you're

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
any material or any color then you're

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.740 
any material or any color then you're
going<00:00:30.230> to<00:00:30.350> have<00:00:30.410> all<00:00:31.010> four<00:00:31.100> sides<00:00:31.790> so<00:00:32.300> start

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
going to have all four sides so start

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.520 
going to have all four sides so start
and<00:00:32.989> want<00:00:33.230> to<00:00:33.320> the<00:00:33.470> side<00:00:33.739> by<00:00:34.120> folding<00:00:35.120> it<00:00:35.300> over

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
and want to the side by folding it over

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.990 
and want to the side by folding it over
pinning<00:00:36.530> it<00:00:36.680> down<00:00:36.710> and<00:00:37.160> installing<00:00:37.580> then

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
pinning it down and installing then

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.319 
pinning it down and installing then
repeat<00:00:38.390> with<00:00:38.420> all<00:00:38.660> four<00:00:38.960> sides

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.200 

next<00:00:42.230> cut<00:00:42.440> out<00:00:42.589> a<00:00:42.739> rectangle<00:00:42.769> that<00:00:43.609> measures

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
next cut out a rectangle that measures

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.040 
next cut out a rectangle that measures
24<00:00:45.170> and<00:00:45.379> a<00:00:45.500> half<00:00:45.530> by<00:00:46.190> five<00:00:46.820> and<00:00:47.269> a<00:00:47.510> half<00:00:47.539> and

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.720 

flip<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.990> rectangle<00:01:04.620> inside<00:01:04.770> out<00:01:05.190> and<00:01:05.460> once

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:05.730 
flip the rectangle inside out and once

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.940 
flip the rectangle inside out and once
again<00:01:05.910> fold<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:06.570> in<00:01:06.810> half<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.290> Hammel<00:01:07.680> on<00:01:07.830> the

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
again fold it in half and Hammel on the

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.860 
again fold it in half and Hammel on the
side

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:11.870 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.950 

fold<00:01:12.870> it<00:01:13.050> inside<00:01:13.230> out

piece of fabric into the smaller piece
of<00:01:20.840> fabric<00:01:21.170> and<00:01:21.650> just<00:01:22.340> watch<00:01:22.670> as<00:01:22.970> I<00:01:23.240> gather<00:01:23.510> it

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
of fabric and just watch as I gather it

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.649 
of fabric and just watch as I gather it
together<00:01:24.070> pull<00:01:25.070> the<00:01:25.340> smaller<00:01:26.150> piece<00:01:26.479> of

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
together pull the smaller piece of

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.420 
together pull the smaller piece of
rectangle<00:01:27.229> into<00:01:27.350> the<00:01:27.619> middle<00:01:27.950> of<00:01:28.040> the<00:01:28.220> large

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
rectangle into the middle of the large

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:37.690 
rectangle into the middle of the large
fabric

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.959 

with<00:01:38.689> the<00:01:38.840> right<00:01:39.079> side<00:01:39.380> up<00:01:39.680> now<00:01:40.549> you're<00:01:40.789> going

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:40.969 
with the right side up now you're going

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:45.520 
with the right side up now you're going
to<00:01:41.090> fold<00:01:41.119> the<00:01:41.869> upper<00:01:42.350> corners<00:01:42.740> together<00:01:44.530> come

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
to fold the upper corners together come

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.819 
to fold the upper corners together come
along<00:01:45.890> the<00:01:46.100> dotted<00:01:46.310> line<00:01:47.469> after<00:01:48.469> you're<00:01:48.649> done

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
along the dotted line after you're done

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:50.620 
along the dotted line after you're done
sewing<00:01:49.219> it<00:01:49.579> you're<00:01:49.789> going<00:01:49.969> to<00:01:50.060> flip<00:01:50.329> it<00:01:50.450> inside

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
sewing it you're going to flip it inside

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:58.270 
sewing it you're going to flip it inside
out<00:01:55.750> so<00:01:56.750> it's<00:01:56.990> going<00:01:57.170> to<00:01:57.229> look<00:01:57.319> like<00:01:57.500> this<00:01:57.920> this

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
out so it's going to look like this this

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.490 
out so it's going to look like this this
is<00:01:59.000> the<00:01:59.390> right<00:01:59.750> side<00:02:00.049> up

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.470 

and<00:02:04.680> you're<00:02:05.430> just<00:02:05.580> going<00:02:05.760> to<00:02:05.850> lay<00:02:06.060> it<00:02:06.090> out<00:02:06.420> like

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:06.480 
and you're just going to lay it out like

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.790 
and you're just going to lay it out like
so<00:02:06.930> and<00:02:08.119> down<00:02:09.119> here<00:02:09.509> if<00:02:09.840> you<00:02:10.050> can<00:02:10.229> see<00:02:10.500> it's

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
so and down here if you can see it's

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.850 
so and down here if you can see it's
like<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.180> triangular<00:02:12.180> shape<00:02:12.470> it's<00:02:13.470> going<00:02:13.770> to

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
like a triangular shape it's going to

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.380 
like a triangular shape it's going to
make<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:15.620> best<00:02:16.620> really<00:02:17.040> long<00:02:17.280> so<00:02:17.730> what<00:02:18.000> I<00:02:18.030> like

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
make the best really long so what I like

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.120 
make the best really long so what I like
to<00:02:18.420> do<00:02:18.750> is<00:02:19.160> open<00:02:20.160> this<00:02:20.550> flap<00:02:21.830> I'm<00:02:22.830> going<00:02:23.040> to

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
to do is open this flap I'm going to

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.520 
to do is open this flap I'm going to
fold<00:02:23.459> this<00:02:23.760> up<00:02:24.030> to<00:02:24.450> get<00:02:24.600> rid<00:02:24.840> of<00:02:24.870> that<00:02:24.990> triangle

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
fold this up to get rid of that triangle

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.460 
fold this up to get rid of that triangle
shape<00:02:26.070> so<00:02:26.790> now<00:02:26.940> it's<00:02:27.209> an<00:02:27.450> even<00:02:28.850> line<00:02:30.260> and<00:02:31.260> I'll

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
shape so now it's an even line and I'll

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.220 
shape so now it's an even line and I'll
float<00:02:31.680> it<00:02:31.830> back<00:02:31.950> over<00:02:32.360> so<00:02:33.360> if<00:02:33.690> you<00:02:33.810> can<00:02:33.959> see

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
float it back over so if you can see

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.460 
float it back over so if you can see
it's<00:02:34.380> more<00:02:34.740> of<00:02:34.890> a<00:02:35.010> square<00:02:35.670> shape<00:02:36.060> now<00:02:36.470> so

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
it's more of a square shape now so

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.180 
it's more of a square shape now so
basically<00:02:38.040> what<00:02:38.370> I<00:02:38.400> did<00:02:38.520> as<00:02:39.620> you<00:02:40.620> can<00:02:40.800> see<00:02:41.040> this

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
basically what I did as you can see this

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.180 
basically what I did as you can see this
is<00:02:41.400> just<00:02:41.430> how<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.760> vest<00:02:42.090> will<00:02:42.270> look<00:02:42.450> like<00:02:43.190> then

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
is just how the vest will look like then

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.540 
is just how the vest will look like then
you're<00:02:44.400> going<00:02:44.550> to<00:02:44.610> fold<00:02:44.850> it<00:02:45.060> up<00:02:45.270> and<00:02:46.550> you're

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
you're going to fold it up and you're

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.490 
you're going to fold it up and you're
going<00:02:47.700> to<00:02:47.760> sew<00:02:48.090> along<00:02:48.510> here<00:02:50.360> on<00:02:51.360> each<00:02:51.660> side<00:02:52.020> so

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
going to sew along here on each side so

00:02:52.500 --> 00:03:01.960 
going to sew along here on each side so
I'm<00:02:52.620> going<00:02:52.770> to<00:02:52.800> repeat<00:02:53.100> on<00:02:53.280> this<00:02:53.489> side

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.950 

like<00:03:02.510> so<00:03:02.810> and<00:03:03.140> then<00:03:03.170> I'm<00:03:04.010> going<00:03:04.250> to<00:03:04.600> sew<00:03:05.600> right

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:05.960 
like so and then I'm going to sew right

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:14.490 
like so and then I'm going to sew right
along<00:03:06.020> these<00:03:06.800> lines
