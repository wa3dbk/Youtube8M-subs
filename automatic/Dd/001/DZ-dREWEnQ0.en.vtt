straight through um but this one it gets

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.400 
straight through um but this one it gets
a<00:03:24.700> little<00:03:24.820> it<00:03:25.510> gives<00:03:25.660> a<00:03:25.750> little<00:03:25.930> resistance

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
a little it gives a little resistance

the time let's see if the other one has

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.260 
the time let's see if the other one has
a<00:05:02.870> different<00:05:03.289> texture<00:05:03.560> shall<00:05:03.889> we<00:05:04.060> because<00:05:05.060> I

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
a different texture shall we because I

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.080 
a different texture shall we because I
