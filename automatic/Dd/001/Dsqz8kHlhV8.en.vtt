00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
about the Aquaman comments because I

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:13.089 
about the Aquaman comments because I
think<00:04:11.359> Zack<00:04:11.660> Snyder<00:04:11.900> says<00:04:12.079> you'll<00:04:12.470> be<00:04:12.530> aware

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:16.390 
think Zack Snyder says you'll be aware
of<00:04:13.250> his<00:04:13.400> existence<00:04:13.780> so<00:04:14.780> that<00:04:15.049> tells<00:04:15.500> me<00:04:15.650> super

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400

the<00:04:21.470> Wonder<00:04:21.680> Woman<00:04:21.890> role<00:04:22.099> will<00:04:22.280> be<00:04:22.400> small<00:04:22.700> I

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
the Wonder Woman role will be small I

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.300 
the Wonder Woman role will be small I
hope<00:04:23.510> that's<00:04:23.750> the<00:04:23.840> case<00:04:23.930> because<00:04:24.469> I<00:04:24.710> want

because even though Superman may and I

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.010 
developed a little more I want to see
him<00:05:13.370> talk<00:05:13.580> yeah<00:05:13.850> fine<00:05:14.240> but<00:05:14.389> he<00:05:14.479> was<00:05:14.600> developed

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
him talk yeah fine but he was developed

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.650 
him talk yeah fine but he was developed
in<00:05:15.139> Man<00:05:15.290> of<00:05:15.410> Steel<00:05:15.560> for<00:05:16.370> me<00:05:16.490> and<00:05:16.790> I<00:05:17.240> and<00:05:17.479> I<00:05:17.600> think

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
in Man of Steel for me and I and I think

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.210 
in Man of Steel for me and I and I think
that<00:05:17.990> you<00:05:18.050> know<00:05:18.139> we<00:05:18.260> know<00:05:18.410> who<00:05:18.560> he<00:05:18.680> is<00:05:18.830> in<00:05:19.040> this

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
that you know we know who he is in this

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.700 
that you know we know who he is in this
universe<00:05:19.400> the<00:05:20.240> last<00:05:20.510> vision<00:05:21.050> we<00:05:21.260> have<00:05:21.500> of

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
universe the last vision we have of

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.830 
universe the last vision we have of
Batman<00:05:22.280> is<00:05:22.669> Christian<00:05:23.210> Bale<00:05:23.360> and<00:05:23.600> that's

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 
Batman is Christian Bale and that's

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.690 
Batman is Christian Bale and that's
clearly<00:05:24.290> not<00:05:24.380> the<00:05:24.530> Batman<00:05:24.830> that's<00:05:25.250> in<00:05:25.460> know

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 
clearly not the Batman that's in know

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:27.340 
clearly not the Batman that's in know
there<00:05:25.850> might<00:05:25.970> be<00:05:26.000> elements<00:05:26.570> of<00:05:26.720> that<00:05:26.990> type<00:05:27.320> of

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:27.350 
there might be elements of that type of

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.190 
there might be elements of that type of
Batman<00:05:27.919> in<00:05:28.100> this<00:05:28.220> one<00:05:28.400> but<00:05:28.700> Batman<00:05:29.360> was<00:05:29.630> always

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.200 
Batman in this one but Batman was always

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.990 
Batman in this one but Batman was always
damaged<00:05:30.620> though<00:05:30.800> he<00:05:31.160> was<00:05:31.310> damaged<00:05:31.729> from<00:05:31.789> when

because I think this is the guy that
that<00:06:19.490> can<00:06:19.820> go<00:06:20.000> through<00:06:20.210> those<00:06:20.300> types<00:06:20.539> of

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:20.660 
that can go through those types of

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.170 
that can go through those types of
emotions<00:06:21.200> and<00:06:21.380> portray<00:06:21.919> this<00:06:22.220> type<00:06:22.580> of<00:06:22.610> Batman

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:23.180 
emotions and portray this type of Batman

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.300

00:06:40.299 --> 00:06:40.309 
getting to the point where we were

00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:42.249 
getting to the point where we were
referring<00:06:40.669> to<00:06:40.879> him<00:06:40.999> as<00:06:41.029> one<00:06:41.270> of<00:06:41.389> the<00:06:41.479> Masters

are ready they could but if it could

00:06:44.059 --> 00:06:45.999 
are ready they could but if it could
possibly<00:06:44.240> happen<00:06:44.689> and<00:06:45.139> there's<00:06:45.740> a<00:06:45.770> reason<00:06:45.979> for
