00:00:00.016 --> 00:00:01.070
 Hey! Hey! Chocolate Ball! 

00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:03.033
 Hey! Chocolate Ball! 

00:00:04.027 --> 00:00:05.032
嘿 chocolate ball 

00:00:05.033 --> 00:00:06.091
 Why do you wear a hair band? 

00:00:06.091 --> 00:00:08.086
 Hahaha, annoying guy 

00:00:08.086 --> 00:00:10.050
 Things are not what you think 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.033
 Wow, are you still the same as the lemon grandfather? 

00:00:12.032 --> 00:00:15.080
 It seems that it’s not me that has lost my pants. 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.010
 Hahaha, I am a coconut 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.024
 I am a kung fu master, this kitchen will soon be... 

00:00:23.024 --> 00:00:25.028
 Hey, what's going on here? 

00:00:31.097 --> 00:00:33.051
 Hey, what happened? 

00:00:39.094 --> 00:00:41.092
 Yeah! I have new friends! 

00:00:51.054 --> 00:00:53.038
 All the enemies have been killed by me. 

00:00:53.036 --> 00:00:56.061
 This kingdom is now under my iron fist 

00:00:56.063 --> 00:00:57.083
 Iron Hand: Sorry, I am late. 

00:00:57.082 --> 00:00:59.015
 There is really enough stuff outside. 

00:01:03.084 --> 00:01:06.015
 Wow, what happened? 

00:01:06.015 --> 00:01:07.090
 Who is that coconut? 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.061
 Has anyone mentioned coconut? 

00:01:09.063 --> 00:01:11.040
 Hey, who is talking? 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.079
 It seems that you have some questions. 

00:01:12.078 --> 00:01:15.094
 At this time, maybe you should ask... Ninja fruit 

00:01:15.093 --> 00:01:17.047
 okay 

00:01:17.048 --> 00:01:18.049
 Where is this? 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:20.057
 This is my secret dojo 

00:01:20.057 --> 00:01:22.016
 Do you mean the bottom of the stove? 

00:01:22.016 --> 00:01:23.019
 Well, probably. 

00:01:23.019 --> 00:01:25.039
 The coconut you just mentioned, will he use it... 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.053
 effort? 

00:01:26.052 --> 00:01:30.030
 It seems that my deadly enemy is coming back to the kitchen. 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.066
 I don't know what is raging. 

00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:33.091
 But he destroyed everything. 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.021
 There is no time for you to laugh now. 

00:01:35.078 --> 00:01:37.087
 I want to teach you the secret rumors of ninja fruit. 

00:01:37.087 --> 00:01:39.054
 Let you go back to the counter 

00:01:39.054 --> 00:01:42.037
 Destroy all...the everything that is destroyed 

00:01:42.037 --> 00:01:44.030
 Especially the coconut 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.019
 Um... Isn’t it faster for you to solve it directly? 

00:01:47.019 --> 00:01:49.037
 No, I won’t do this. 

00:02:19.045 --> 00:02:21.006
 Thank you for everything you have done, Ninja Fruit... 

00:02:21.006 --> 00:02:22.062
 Especially this pajamas you gave me. 

00:02:22.062 --> 00:02:24.039
 Ok, your training is almost finished. 

00:02:24.038 --> 00:02:27.063
 Now I have only one thing left to tell you. 

00:02:27.063 --> 00:02:30.079
 Clothes should be washed with cold water and then tumbled 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.073
 Um... Is this a way of practicing? 

00:02:33.074 --> 00:02:36.015
 The cup you drink now is my own. 

00:02:36.014 --> 00:02:37.076
 If it is too sweet, please tell me, ok? 

00:02:37.078 --> 00:02:38.080
 traitor 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.079
 Hey, look at your "little" friends yourself. 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:43.022
 twinkle Twinkle Little Star 

00:02:43.021 --> 00:02:45.056
 Hanging in the sky 

00:02:45.056 --> 00:02:47.037
 I love you, marshmallow! 

00:02:47.038 --> 00:02:48.063
 be quiet! 

00:02:48.062 --> 00:02:51.036
 I feel a breath 

00:02:51.038 --> 00:02:54.037
 Familiar...but deadly 

00:02:54.037 --> 00:02:56.012
 Hey! Hey! Shell head! 

00:02:56.012 --> 00:02:58.025
 Come on! Idiot! 

00:02:58.025 --> 00:03:01.000
 Hello you all 

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:03.031
 Oh, that's not... 

00:03:03.032 --> 00:03:04.045
 Liu Ding!! 

00:03:04.044 --> 00:03:08.045
 Oh, it seems that this annoying guy has accepted the training of my enemy. 

00:03:08.045 --> 00:03:10.078
 Let me beat you with the power of kung fu!! 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:12.022
 Hey! Hey! Coconut 

00:03:12.021 --> 00:03:13.008
 What? 

00:03:13.008 --> 00:03:15.029
 Eat my skin! 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.003
 Hahaha, ready to die. 

00:03:18.086 --> 00:03:19.070
 Oh, no! 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:20.072
 Wait 

00:03:22.031 --> 00:03:24.008
 Wait a moment... 

00:03:24.008 --> 00:03:26.081
 Hey! Hey! Coconut 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.036
 knife 

00:03:30.007 --> 00:03:32.032
 Wow, it looks like it hurts (royal pain has trouble, pun) 

00:03:33.092 --> 00:03:35.059
 Dude, you are really like a ninja. 

00:03:37.007 --> 00:03:39.054
 Well done, my apprentice 

00:03:39.054 --> 00:03:43.015
 You defeated my mortal enemy and revived the glory of the ninja fruit. 

00:03:43.014 --> 00:03:44.074
 Yeah! Thank you, teacher. 

00:03:44.074 --> 00:03:46.090
 But your dress still has to return me. 

00:03:46.092 --> 00:03:47.085
 Oh 

00:03:47.085 --> 00:03:49.051
 Fast, I have said that it is just borrowing you. 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.048
