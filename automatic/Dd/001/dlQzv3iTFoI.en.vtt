00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:48.859 
could see myself in the mirror but right

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:50.739 
could see myself in the mirror but right
here<00:00:49.070> is<00:00:49.280> where<00:00:49.519> he's<00:00:49.640> to<00:00:49.760> practice<00:00:50.179> when<00:00:50.690> I

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:50.749 
here is where he's to practice when I

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:52.239 
here is where he's to practice when I
was<00:00:50.899> a<00:00:50.929> soccer<00:00:51.260> I<00:00:51.469> used<00:00:51.649> to<00:00:51.739> practice<00:00:51.920> on<00:00:52.159> the

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:52.249 
was a soccer I used to practice on the

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:53.829 
was a soccer I used to practice on the
grass<00:00:52.489> when<00:00:52.879> I<00:00:52.940> was<00:00:53.059> playing<00:00:53.239> basketball<00:00:53.449> used

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:53.839 
grass when I was playing basketball used

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:55.720 
grass when I was playing basketball used
to<00:00:53.899> practice<00:00:54.199> on<00:00:54.319> cement<00:00:54.710> it<00:00:55.190> doesn't<00:00:55.579> matter

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
to practice on cement it doesn't matter

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:56.259 
to practice on cement it doesn't matter
all<00:00:56.059> right

00:00:56.259 --> 00:00:56.269 
all right

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:58.450 
all right
so<00:00:56.929> three<00:00:57.199> ways<00:00:57.379> one<00:00:57.829> slide<00:00:58.100> through

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
so three ways one slide through

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.930 
so three ways one slide through
different<00:00:58.729> ways<00:00:58.989> versus<00:00:59.989> the<00:01:00.079> MJ<00:01:00.559> way<00:01:00.940> he

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
different ways versus the MJ way he

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.439 
different ways versus the MJ way he
never<00:01:02.269> lifts<00:01:02.960> up<00:01:03.050> his<00:01:03.199> feet<00:01:03.530> and<00:01:03.800> he<00:01:04.610> doesn't

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:05.449 
never lifts up his feet and he doesn't

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:08.590 
never lifts up his feet and he doesn't
use<00:01:05.960> his<00:01:05.990> ankles<00:01:06.680> as<00:01:06.800> much<00:01:07.040> to<00:01:07.280> rotate<00:01:07.700> all<00:01:08.330> he

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
use his ankles as much to rotate all he

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.230 
use his ankles as much to rotate all he
does<00:01:08.870> is<00:01:09.200> push<00:01:09.560> pull<00:01:10.009> like<00:01:10.280> basic<00:01:10.759> push<00:01:11.000> pull

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:11.240 
does is push pull like basic push pull

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:18.649 
does is push pull like basic push pull
transition<00:01:11.780> so<00:01:12.560> he<00:01:12.710> goes<00:01:12.920> like<00:01:13.070> this

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.600 

and<00:01:19.659> then<00:01:19.869> he<00:01:20.049> does<00:01:20.289> it<00:01:20.320> he'll<00:01:21.070> do<00:01:21.250> it<00:01:21.369> quicker

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
and then he does it he'll do it quicker

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.940 
and then he does it he'll do it quicker
when<00:01:22.210> he's<00:01:22.329> filling<00:01:22.659> it<00:01:22.810> and<00:01:23.530> he<00:01:23.590> just<00:01:23.619> goes

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
when he's filling it and he just goes

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.899 
when he's filling it and he just goes
