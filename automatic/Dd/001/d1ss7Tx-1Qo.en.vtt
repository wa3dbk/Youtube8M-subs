this<00:00:51.629> is<00:00:51.780> browser-based<00:00:51.989> as<00:00:52.440> well<00:00:52.620> yeah<00:00:53.070> what

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
this is browser-based as well yeah what

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.240

platform<00:00:56.940> so<00:00:57.600> we<00:00:58.440> blurred<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.710> line<00:00:59.039> kind<00:00:59.370> of

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
platform so we blurred the line kind of

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.119 
platform so we blurred the line kind of
leader<00:00:59.730> in<00:00:59.820> browser<00:01:00.030> gaming<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.719> between

client gaming and high quality gaming

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.179 
client gaming and high quality gaming
