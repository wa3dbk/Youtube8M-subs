an<00:01:01.160> ultimate<00:01:02.110> human<00:01:03.110> realization<00:01:03.830> it's<00:01:04.430> the

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
an ultimate human realization it's the

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.940 
an ultimate human realization it's the

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
leading edge of human potential there's

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.410 
leading edge of human potential there's
no<00:01:07.160> doubt<00:01:07.490> that<00:01:07.520> almost<00:01:08.390> everybody<00:01:08.810> and

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
no doubt that almost everybody and

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.210 
no doubt that almost everybody and
mankind's<00:01:11.420> past<00:01:12.050> has<00:01:12.410> looked<00:01:12.619> at<00:01:12.770> the<00:01:12.890> sky<00:01:13.190> and

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
mankind's past has looked at the sky and

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.150 
mankind's past has looked at the sky and
thought<00:01:13.700> how<00:01:13.880> wonderful<00:01:13.910> it<00:01:14.479> would<00:01:14.570> be<00:01:14.630> to<00:01:14.750> fly

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.160

thought how wonderful it would be to fly
and<00:01:16.160> now<00:01:16.580> we<00:01:16.670> have<00:01:16.820> vast<00:01:17.540> resources<00:01:18.170> of

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660 
different types of aircraft that we can

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.389 
different types of aircraft that we can
use<00:01:20.690> in<00:01:21.229> order<00:01:21.619> to<00:01:21.740> make<00:01:21.830> our<00:01:22.009> dreams<00:01:22.280> come
