00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:05.480
 I'm always ticker today 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:26.240
 So what I made and garlic fine 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:30.919
 made and vinegar or chicken easy 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:34.970
 elisa topeka powder so now i leave 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:39.820
 that betrays a bit and he does 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:43.310
 you always come here must imperial vegetables 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:46.010
 quite simply you do not have to cut 

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.620
 and has zero stress makes you exist 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:57.410
 it now a book about it 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:58.820
 Sorry so I have that over the 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:15.020
 let it drain overnight 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:28.610
 just give them so much water 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:32.180
 whole pack made the degree of hardness 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:36.979
 are so lucky is the pan 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:38.510
 Luckily the breakdown is good I saluted 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.440
 I hope it's okay if I'm like this 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.440
 they are here 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.170
 dollar 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:09.590
 a bit of pepper and paprika powder 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:21.080
 oregano basil 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.650
 classic right 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.650
 This is immediately with Rieke 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:13.099
 so and now I still pass 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:13.099
 tomato with spaghetti 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.500
 you can do the whole project that 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:27.219
 Protect whole thing purely 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.219
 I do not do that now 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.760
 again a little bit of silicone 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:54.090
 or even better a little bit more 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:21.420
 So the food is as good as even 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:25.410
 no cow has almost none 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:26.970
 carbohydrates are not many and only which 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.130
 which are slowly digested 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.050
 Of course you can be irritated 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:33.240
 make or wholegrain pasta like you 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.850
 but I would like to try it that way 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.290
 Tastes delicious and gives her quiet 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.090
 can still tomatoes pure 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.950
 snip if you want or just 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.720
 In any case, even more happened 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.320
 tomatoes so you had more like that 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:49.190
 that tastes great I recommend it 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.190
