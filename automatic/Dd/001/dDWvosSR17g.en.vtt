00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.580
 But here the length 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:09.900
 If you raise too much, it will be difficult to take a good balance a little, so this number is this time 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:15.660
 Keep it 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:18.539
 It 's the top part of 8 if it feels like I'm tightening it based on here, but it's still this 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:22.380
 That is the gate here 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:26.460
 I'm still in the state but I will do it 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:32.579
 Something like this is put in a little shade. Therefore it pushed up coming cause 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:34.800
 For example, if you cut too much, or if you cut the upper hair well , you may see through here 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.050
 There is something, but there too 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.190
 At this time 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.870
 I came here there was at the beginning 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:45.250
 Also it is a little high here, but I rounded a made to feel that there was 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.320
 In a feeling like suppressing the roundness 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.050
 It's a little wolfish layer 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.310
 By do, such as coming out stick while the aperture 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.250
 I think that let to the appearance 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:58.050
 At first it is setting 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:00.420
 Because it is easy for the core to be high 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.850
 Familiar way 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:07.299
 As with the previous fall, the scissors are like this 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.299
 Will increase 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.940
 Also at this time, be sure not to come out too much 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.240
 It is an inner layer 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:19.900
 The thinning is at the angle of the layer 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.900
 I will go out 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:28.180
 We can take 3 to the port in the current situation and this is relatively 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:32.200
 I have a sense of left and right source chirp 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:34.230
 I think it's already done to some extent 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.130
 After details 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:39.260
 Always I Kofu 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.440
 I think it's heavy 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:46.700
 It's inside 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:51.320
 When you turn on the little finger, as against from the front here 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.590
 It is whether or not there is a tight sense of tightness 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.060
 This to in 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.060
 Why is it finished 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:06.060
 Hair this way in that because I was in the 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:10.100
 I feel like bounced off the hands 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.490
 It feels like it's true that this is true 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.120
 When finished 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.120
 And candidate 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.810
 At that time, I was assembled in a way that it was easy to arrange so as not to loosen this too much 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.810
 but 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:27.590
 That kind of feeling 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:29.360
 There is that going to Pula Cypher with an emphasis on something 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.569
 There are many these days , yes 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:36.590
 I want various things without being caught in one 4 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:39.310
 Anywhere but Is the like can cope 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.310
 I think it's good
