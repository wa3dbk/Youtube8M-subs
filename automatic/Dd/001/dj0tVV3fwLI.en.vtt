00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.560 
I'm a fan of baseball and believe it or
not<00:01:31.920> now<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.310> Epstein<00:01:32.939> went<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.270> Cubbies

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570

not now that Epstein went to the Cubbies
I<00:01:33.689> truly<00:01:33.960> think<00:01:34.079> there's<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.320> Back<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.590> the
