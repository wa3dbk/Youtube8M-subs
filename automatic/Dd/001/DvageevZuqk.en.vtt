00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
performing the trick try out different

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.279 
performing the trick try out different
timings<00:01:31.030> of<00:01:31.119> the<00:01:31.240> ollie<00:01:31.390> and<00:01:31.630> tilt<00:01:31.899> to<00:01:32.109> see

timings of the ollie and tilt to see

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:34.200 
timings of the ollie and tilt to see
which<00:01:32.469> is<00:01:32.590> more<00:01:32.619> comfortable<00:01:33.130> for<00:01:33.310> you<00:01:33.369> flick

which is more comfortable for you flick
flip<00:01:34.539> tricks<00:01:34.780> use<00:01:34.929> the<00:01:35.079> same<00:01:35.289> idea<00:01:35.590> of<00:01:35.679> an

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
flip tricks use the same idea of an

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.219 
flip tricks use the same idea of an
ollie<00:01:36.159> and<00:01:36.429> another<00:01:36.729> motion<00:01:36.939> so<00:01:37.749> first<00:01:37.990> you<00:01:38.109> do

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
ollie and another motion so first you do

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:39.779 
ollie and another motion so first you do
your<00:01:38.380> ollie<00:01:38.560> then<00:01:38.859> instead<00:01:39.130> of<00:01:39.189> a<00:01:39.310> tilt<00:01:39.579> you

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:39.789 
your ollie then instead of a tilt you

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:41.340 
your ollie then instead of a tilt you
will<00:01:39.939> quickly<00:01:40.210> rotate<00:01:40.780> the<00:01:40.960> board<00:01:41.140> either

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
will quickly rotate the board either

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.620 
will quickly rotate the board either
clockwise<00:01:41.590> or<00:01:42.009> counterclockwise<00:01:42.630> you'll

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
clockwise or counterclockwise you'll

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.209 
clockwise or counterclockwise you'll
notice<00:01:43.929> that<00:01:44.049> the<00:01:44.200> board<00:01:44.409> spins<00:01:44.799> around<00:01:44.920> in

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:45.219 
notice that the board spins around in

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:47.279 
notice that the board spins around in
the<00:01:45.310> direction<00:01:45.549> the<00:01:45.759> quick<00:01:45.969> rotation<00:01:46.509> once

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
the direction the quick rotation once

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:49.050 
the direction the quick rotation once
again<00:01:47.590> it's<00:01:47.770> lift<00:01:48.009> up<00:01:48.159> quickly<00:01:48.520> for<00:01:48.700> an<00:01:48.759> ollie

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
again it's lift up quickly for an ollie

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.760 
again it's lift up quickly for an ollie
then<00:01:49.359> a<00:01:49.389> quick<00:01:49.659> rotation<00:01:50.350> of<00:01:50.439> the<00:01:50.530> board

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
then a quick rotation of the board

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.219 
then a quick rotation of the board
either<00:01:50.979> clockwise<00:01:51.249> or<00:01:51.460> counter<00:01:51.880> clockwise

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
either clockwise or counter clockwise

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.230 
either clockwise or counter clockwise
now<00:01:53.229> it's<00:01:53.469> time<00:01:53.679> to<00:01:53.710> get<00:01:53.889> into<00:01:54.069> manuals<00:01:54.639> with

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
now it's time to get into manuals with

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:56.940 
now it's time to get into manuals with
Ollie's<00:01:55.659> it's<00:01:55.960> all<00:01:56.170> about<00:01:56.350> popping<00:01:56.770> up<00:01:56.859> the

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
Ollie's it's all about popping up the

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.889 
Ollie's it's all about popping up the
front<00:01:57.100> of<00:01:57.219> the<00:01:57.280> board<00:01:57.490> manuals<00:01:58.389> it's<00:01:58.630> still

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
front of the board manuals it's still

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:00.330 
front of the board manuals it's still
about<00:01:59.079> lifting<00:01:59.469> the<00:01:59.560> front<00:01:59.770> of<00:01:59.829> the<00:01:59.920> board<00:02:00.159> but

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
about lifting the front of the board but

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.370 
about lifting the front of the board but
now<00:02:00.549> we<00:02:00.609> want<00:02:00.850> you<00:02:00.999> to<00:02:01.090> do<00:02:01.240> it<00:02:01.359> slower<00:02:01.780> by

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
now we want you to do it slower by

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.929 
now we want you to do it slower by
slowly<00:02:02.770> raising<00:02:03.280> the<00:02:03.340> front<00:02:03.579> of<00:02:03.639> the<00:02:03.700> board

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
slowly raising the front of the board

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:05.429 
slowly raising the front of the board
you<00:02:04.060> will<00:02:04.149> see<00:02:04.329> that<00:02:04.479> the<00:02:04.600> skateboard<00:02:05.020> doesn't

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 
you will see that the skateboard doesn't

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:07.260 
you will see that the skateboard doesn't
pop<00:02:05.619> into<00:02:05.859> the<00:02:05.979> air<00:02:06.130> instead<00:02:07.090> we<00:02:07.240> are

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
pop into the air instead we are

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.389 
pop into the air instead we are
initiating

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
initiating

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.089

now<00:02:11.819> we're<00:02:12.030> vert<00:02:12.239> skating<00:02:12.569> you'll<00:02:12.840> want<00:02:13.019> to

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:13.049 
now we're vert skating you'll want to

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:14.720 
now we're vert skating you'll want to
turn<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.440> board<00:02:13.680> to<00:02:13.799> be<00:02:13.830> parallel<00:02:14.430> with<00:02:14.459> the

of the board is the nose to drop in

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.850 
of the board is the nose to drop in
simply<00:02:27.450> raise<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.720> nose<00:02:28.079> of<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.290> board<00:02:28.530> and

simply raise the nose of the board and

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.860 
simply raise the nose of the board and
then<00:02:29.129> drop<00:02:29.340> it<00:02:29.489> down<00:02:29.610> getting<00:02:30.360> height<00:02:30.659> then

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
then drop it down getting height then

your hand over the front sensor as you

your hand over the front sensor as you
