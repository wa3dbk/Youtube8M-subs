00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
that I'm going to add in some superfine

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.470 
that I'm going to add in some superfine
sugar<00:02:15.590> now<00:02:16.340> I'm<00:02:16.550> using<00:02:16.820> superfine<00:02:17.450> sugar

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
sugar now I'm using superfine sugar

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.140 
sugar now I'm using superfine sugar
because<00:02:18.110> this<00:02:18.350> is<00:02:18.530> a<00:02:18.560> cold<00:02:18.860> drink<00:02:19.100> so<00:02:19.430> regular

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
because this is a cold drink so regular

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.100 
because this is a cold drink so regular
sugar<00:02:20.360> will<00:02:20.570> is<00:02:20.630> going<00:02:20.720> to<00:02:20.780> have<00:02:20.900> a<00:02:20.960> really

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
sugar will is going to have a really

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.320 
sugar will is going to have a really
difficult<00:02:21.410> time<00:02:21.650> to<00:02:21.950> dissolve<00:02:22.310> if<00:02:22.670> you<00:02:23.180> don't

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
difficult time to dissolve if you don't

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.700 
difficult time to dissolve if you don't
have<00:02:23.480> superfine<00:02:23.960> sugar<00:02:23.990> you<00:02:24.410> can<00:02:24.560> make<00:02:24.680> a

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
have superfine sugar you can make a

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.080 
have superfine sugar you can make a
simple<00:02:25.100> syrup<00:02:25.250> and<00:02:25.520> you<00:02:25.550> can<00:02:25.700> go<00:02:25.820> ahead<00:02:25.970> and

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
simple syrup and you can go ahead and

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.940 
simple syrup and you can go ahead and
check<00:02:26.240> my<00:02:26.420> quick<00:02:26.660> tip<00:02:26.690> video<00:02:27.410> on<00:02:27.680> how<00:02:27.800> to<00:02:27.830> make

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
check my quick tip video on how to make

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.950 
check my quick tip video on how to make
simple<00:02:28.550> syrup<00:02:28.730> but<00:02:29.090> it's<00:02:29.210> basically<00:02:29.630> equal

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960 
simple syrup but it's basically equal

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.250 
simple syrup but it's basically equal
parts<00:02:30.200> water<00:02:30.770> to<00:02:31.310> sugar<00:02:31.580> dissolve<00:02:32.300> it<00:02:32.480> cool<00:02:33.050> it

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
parts water to sugar dissolve it cool it

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.090 
parts water to sugar dissolve it cool it
you're<00:02:33.710> good<00:02:33.830> to<00:02:33.950> go

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100
