say well I think it wouldn't be the best
idea<00:02:58.860> only<00:02:59.670> because<00:02:59.849> like<00:03:00.360> I<00:03:00.599> wouldn't<00:03:01.019> want

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
to stay two schools before like a lot of

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:04.640 
to stay two schools before like a lot of
kids<00:03:02.670> have<00:03:02.790> a<00:03:02.819> job<00:03:03.090> after<00:03:03.480> school<00:03:03.530> for<00:03:04.530> the

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
kids have a job after school for the

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.360 
kids have a job after school for the
moment<00:03:04.859> that<00:03:05.069> I<00:03:05.159> heard<00:03:05.519> that<00:03:05.730> I<00:03:05.760> was<00:03:05.849> like

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
moment that I heard that I was like

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.759 
moment that I heard that I was like
yes<00:03:06.610> because<00:03:07.180> I<00:03:07.239> was<00:03:07.510> dying<00:03:08.049> for<00:03:08.530> that<00:03:08.620> to

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
yes because I was dying for that to

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:10.680 
yes because I was dying for that to
happen<00:03:08.920> eventually<00:03:09.159> I'm<00:03:09.819> not<00:03:10.299> a<00:03:10.360> block

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
happen eventually I'm not a block

happen eventually I'm not a block
schedule<00:03:11.170> kind<00:03:11.379> of<00:03:11.470> gal<00:03:11.590> so<00:03:12.190> I<00:03:12.220> think<00:03:12.370> this

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
schedule kind of gal so I think this

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.309 
schedule kind of gal so I think this
would<00:03:12.819> certainly<00:03:12.970> be<00:03:13.330> you<00:03:13.659> know<00:03:13.750> beneficial

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
would certainly be you know beneficial

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.119 
would certainly be you know beneficial
to<00:03:14.739> both<00:03:14.769> teachers<00:03:15.730> and<00:03:15.940> students<00:03:16.900> um<00:03:17.349> I<00:03:17.830> think

00:03:18.119 --> 00:03:18.129 
to both teachers and students um I think

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:21.539 
to both teachers and students um I think
it's<00:03:18.310> actually<00:03:18.940> got<00:03:19.480> pluses<00:03:20.170> and<00:03:20.379> minuses<00:03:21.190> I

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
it's actually got pluses and minuses I

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:23.550 
it's actually got pluses and minuses I
think<00:03:22.209> for<00:03:22.330> the<00:03:22.390> pluses<00:03:22.840> I<00:03:22.989> think<00:03:23.200> everybody

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
think for the pluses I think everybody

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.170 
think for the pluses I think everybody
would<00:03:23.709> like<00:03:23.890> to<00:03:24.010> have<00:03:24.129> a<00:03:24.159> longer<00:03:24.400> weekend<00:03:24.909> and

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
would like to have a longer weekend and

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.240 
would like to have a longer weekend and
I<00:03:25.450> think<00:03:25.959> the<00:03:26.110> idea<00:03:26.140> of<00:03:26.409> a<00:03:26.500> three-day<00:03:26.860> weekend

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
I think the idea of a three-day weekend

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.789 
I think the idea of a three-day weekend
is<00:03:27.549> really<00:03:28.090> really<00:03:28.209> attractive<00:03:28.810> but<00:03:29.530> i<00:03:29.560> think

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
is really really attractive but i think

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:31.559 
is really really attractive but i think
that<00:03:29.860> students<00:03:30.340> would<00:03:30.430> have<00:03:30.579> to<00:03:30.730> be<00:03:30.940> in<00:03:31.239> school

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
that students would have to be in school

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:33.930 
that students would have to be in school
for<00:03:31.989> a<00:03:32.019> longer<00:03:32.319> day<00:03:32.680> and<00:03:32.980> honestly<00:03:33.819> i<00:03:33.909> think

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
for a longer day and honestly i think

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.149 
for a longer day and honestly i think
their<00:03:34.150> brains<00:03:34.390> would<00:03:34.569> explode<00:03:34.930> um<00:03:35.500> i<00:03:36.069> think

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:36.159 
their brains would explode um i think

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:38.400 
their brains would explode um i think
that<00:03:36.670> it's<00:03:36.849> it'll<00:03:37.329> be<00:03:37.480> nice<00:03:37.690> to<00:03:37.720> have<00:03:37.989> a<00:03:38.140> four

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
that it's it'll be nice to have a four

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.349

question there was a survey that was

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.289 
question there was a survey that was
taken<00:04:14.410> some<00:04:14.650> time<00:04:14.859> ago<00:04:15.040> by<00:04:15.310> the<00:04:15.370> district<00:04:16.060> to

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
workweek to a four-day work week I think

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:27.540 
workweek to a four-day work week I think
that<00:04:25.360> it<00:04:25.599> is<00:04:25.630> a<00:04:26.080> decision<00:04:26.680> that<00:04:26.889> has<00:04:27.280> to<00:04:27.520> be

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
that it is a decision that has to be

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.330 
that it is a decision that has to be
made<00:04:27.940> but<00:04:28.690> made<00:04:29.050> with<00:04:29.080> a<00:04:29.349> lot<00:04:29.560> of<00:04:29.710> information

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
made but made with a lot of information

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.969 
made but made with a lot of information
because<00:04:30.639> child<00:04:31.090> care<00:04:31.450> for<00:04:32.050> folks<00:04:32.410> who<00:04:32.650> are<00:04:32.770> not

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979 
because child care for folks who are not

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:34.740 
because child care for folks who are not
employed<00:04:33.340> by<00:04:33.370> the<00:04:33.610> school<00:04:33.820> systems<00:04:34.479> we<00:04:34.570> might

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
employed by the school systems we might

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.540 
employed by the school systems we might
have<00:04:34.930> school-age<00:04:35.500> children<00:04:35.889> who<00:04:36.280> would<00:04:36.430> be

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
have school-age children who would be

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.219 
have school-age children who would be
off<00:04:36.729> from<00:04:37.060> school<00:04:37.270> during<00:04:37.750> a<00:04:37.840> day<00:04:38.020> that

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:38.229 
off from school during a day that

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:40.409 
off from school during a day that
parents<00:04:38.620> are<00:04:38.710> working<00:04:39.270> supervision<00:04:40.270> and

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
parents are working supervision and

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:42.060 
parents are working supervision and
arrangements<00:04:41.080> would<00:04:41.169> have<00:04:41.349> to<00:04:41.500> be<00:04:41.620> made<00:04:41.830> for

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
arrangements would have to be made for

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.890 
arrangements would have to be made for
those<00:04:42.250> kids<00:04:42.550> so<00:04:42.789> I<00:04:42.820> think<00:04:42.940> that<00:04:43.210> the<00:04:43.419> district

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
those kids so I think that the district

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.960 
those kids so I think that the district
in<00:04:44.050> making<00:04:44.800> this<00:04:44.919> decision<00:04:45.310> really<00:04:45.729> is

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
in making this decision really is

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.120 
in making this decision really is
thinking<00:04:46.389> out<00:04:46.510> this<00:04:46.750> process<00:04:47.050> very<00:04:47.560> carefully

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
thinking out this process very carefully

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:50.460 
thinking out this process very carefully
the<00:04:48.669> ultimate<00:04:48.820> goal<00:04:49.270> is<00:04:49.599> to<00:04:49.900> save<00:04:50.139> dollars

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
the ultimate goal is to save dollars

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.560 
the ultimate goal is to save dollars
same<00:04:51.250> dollars<00:04:51.639> particularly<00:04:52.150> on<00:04:52.270> the<00:04:52.389> energy

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
same dollars particularly on the energy

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.080 
same dollars particularly on the energy
costs<00:04:53.139> to<00:04:53.440> run<00:04:53.620> school<00:04:54.099> houses<00:04:54.340> which<00:04:54.760> is<00:04:54.940> an

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
costs to run school houses which is an

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.089 
costs to run school houses which is an
exorbitant<00:04:55.660> amount<00:04:55.750> of<00:04:56.080> money<00:04:56.139> on<00:04:56.500> a<00:04:56.560> daily

00:04:57.089 --> 00:04:57.099 
exorbitant amount of money on a daily

00:04:57.099 --> 00:04:59.250 
exorbitant amount of money on a daily
basis<00:04:57.699> so<00:04:57.880> there<00:04:58.060> would<00:04:58.300> be<00:04:58.330> some<00:04:58.720> sizable

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
basis so there would be some sizable

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.170 
basis so there would be some sizable
savings<00:04:59.740> but<00:05:00.010> you<00:05:00.460> have<00:05:00.610> to<00:05:00.760> really<00:05:00.880> look<00:05:01.060> at

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:01.180 
savings but you have to really look at

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:03.029 
savings but you have to really look at
both<00:05:01.389> sides<00:05:01.419> of<00:05:01.900> the<00:05:02.020> equation<00:05:02.139> so<00:05:02.710> to<00:05:02.740> answer

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.039 
both sides of the equation so to answer

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:05.670 
both sides of the equation so to answer
your<00:05:03.250> question<00:05:03.370> no<00:05:04.260> decision<00:05:05.260> has<00:05:05.440> been<00:05:05.470> made
