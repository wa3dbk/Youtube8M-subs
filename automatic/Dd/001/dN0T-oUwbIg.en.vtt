00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
look like before and after lighting

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:20.110 
look like before and after lighting
effect<00:03:16.070> so<00:03:17.769> um<00:03:18.769> that<00:03:19.430> started<00:03:19.880> with<00:03:19.970> a<00:03:20.030> little

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
effect so um that started with a little

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.620 
effect so um that started with a little
bit<00:03:20.299> cool<00:03:20.480> right<00:03:21.049> there's<00:03:21.230> good<00:03:21.700> and<00:03:22.700> now<00:03:23.480> what

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
bit cool right there's good and now what

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:24.789 
bit cool right there's good and now what
we're<00:03:23.780> do<00:03:23.989> is<00:03:24.110> we're<00:03:24.260> going<00:03:24.410> to<00:03:24.500> add<00:03:24.620> the

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
we're do is we're going to add the

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:26.680 
we're do is we're going to add the
shadow<00:03:25.130> the<00:03:25.850> shadow<00:03:25.880> is<00:03:26.239> probably<00:03:26.480> a<00:03:26.540> little

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
shadow the shadow is probably a little

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.300 
shadow the shadow is probably a little
bit<00:03:26.780> harder<00:03:27.019> the<00:03:27.140> white<00:03:27.410> because<00:03:27.829> the<00:03:28.130> lights

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
bit harder the white because the lights

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.670 
bit harder the white because the lights
really<00:03:28.700> fairly<00:03:29.060> easy<00:03:29.350> about<00:03:30.350> what<00:03:30.470> you<00:03:30.560> are

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
really fairly easy about what you are

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.810 
really fairly easy about what you are
doing<00:03:30.860> is<00:03:30.980> you<00:03:31.100> want<00:03:31.250> to<00:03:31.340> make<00:03:31.459> a<00:03:31.489> new<00:03:31.640> layer

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
doing is you want to make a new layer

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.979 
doing is you want to make a new layer
above<00:03:32.000> this<00:03:32.650> okay<00:03:34.299> flip<00:03:35.299> this<00:03:35.450> so<00:03:35.630> the<00:03:35.720> black

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
above this okay flip this so the black

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:38.050 
above this okay flip this so the black
is<00:03:36.170> the<00:03:36.200> main<00:03:36.470> layer<00:03:36.769> and<00:03:37.070> the<00:03:37.670> reason<00:03:37.910> you<00:03:37.970> had

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
is the main layer and the reason you had

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.360 
is the main layer and the reason you had
to<00:03:38.120> make<00:03:38.239> a<00:03:38.269> new<00:03:38.420> layer<00:03:38.540> is<00:03:38.720> cuz<00:03:39.370> everything

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
to make a new layer is cuz everything

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.449 
to make a new layer is cuz everything
would<00:03:40.489> be<00:03:40.989> everything<00:03:41.989> would<00:03:42.200> be<00:03:42.320> overlaid<00:03:43.130> on

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:43.459 
would be everything would be overlaid on

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.199 
would be everything would be overlaid on
the<00:03:44.030> black<00:03:44.840> to<00:03:45.110> it<00:03:45.290> we<00:03:45.380> don't<00:03:45.530> work<00:03:45.680> that<00:03:45.860> yet

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
the black to it we don't work that yet

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.039 
the black to it we don't work that yet
but<00:03:47.209> what<00:03:47.360> you<00:03:47.420> want<00:03:47.570> to<00:03:47.600> do<00:03:47.720> is<00:03:47.840> when<00:03:47.989> I

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
but what you want to do is when I

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.080 
but what you want to do is when I
started<00:03:48.380> as<00:03:48.500> feet<00:03:48.860> and<00:03:49.100> try<00:03:49.519> not<00:03:49.760> to<00:03:49.880> get<00:03:49.970> any

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
started as feet and try not to get any

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.479 
started as feet and try not to get any
on<00:03:50.209> his<00:03:50.420> feet<00:03:50.750> as<00:03:51.049> try<00:03:51.590> as<00:03:52.010> hard<00:03:52.100> as<00:03:52.190> you<00:03:52.310> can

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
on his feet as try as hard as you can

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.550 
on his feet as try as hard as you can
not<00:03:52.730> to<00:03:52.840> because<00:03:53.840> then<00:03:54.140> it<00:03:54.260> looks<00:03:54.290> kind<00:03:54.530> of

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
not to because then it looks kind of

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.229 
not to because then it looks kind of
weird<00:03:54.620> but<00:03:55.190> if<00:03:55.310> you<00:03:55.400> do<00:03:55.579> you<00:03:55.730> can<00:03:55.850> just<00:03:55.880> go<00:03:56.090> back

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
weird but if you do you can just go back

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.059 
weird but if you do you can just go back
and<00:03:56.390> reset<00:03:56.660> afterwards<00:03:57.109> but
