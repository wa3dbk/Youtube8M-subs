00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:02.800
 Your second segment 

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.089
 The posture is 

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:08.089
 Wired line between telephone and professional 

00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:12.019
 Let's try the law 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.189
 It's called a segment today. 

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:18.909
 Discrete people are connected by a group. 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:20.489
 Because he was drawn 

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:23.489
 All the different hospitals connected in 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:25.859
 It's called Silla. 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.679
 If you select us full lineup, you will be rebounding at once 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:31.199
 There is a number. 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.850
 So in mex you can do the command in vertex 7th 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.450
 To live 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.860
 The orders you make online will make us each exist. 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.350
 Three of these 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.710
 The most commonly used component is probably the 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.210
 I do not think I'll have tax 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.210
 Photo x2 can do 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.080
 This is the command I'm giving images 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.110
 I prefer the commands first, 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.770
 Select supports 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.410
 At the same time, 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:05.790
 Click 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:06.820
 Newly 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.050
 Transient United appears 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.160
 Click the right mouse button. One is called Code Utd 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.720
 I will 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:14.280
 In United 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.650
 . That is operating 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.050
 Freelance 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.180
 free 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.240
 That's right. 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.990
 I can now change the attributes of the selected 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.590
 There is a part. The current status is 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.650
 The part called conwer is added. 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.230
 Zocora and the water are removed. 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.450
 Cybergo is a website homepage, 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.780
 When you switch to these things 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.640
 Each of them is comfortable to the attributes of the cortex. 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:43.340
 then 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.780
 jones newswire corner and baskika have some difference 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.720
 The Yongsan Park 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.439
 Based on Cyberpass 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:55.350
 Keep the left and right segments always straight 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.490
 Let me 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.130
 It's a straight line. 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.439
 I'll make a change. 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:03.340
 Asmus 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.060
 So that the segment you're working on 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.259
 Keeps the curve 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.199
 So smoothly. 

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:16.470
 Bringing a small amount of wear 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.009
 Because it is corner 

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:19.480
 Here, 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.480
 It's a piece that can not even soften. 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:25.000
 If you change the jiu 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.099
 Also, the feeling is smoothly passed over. 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:31.099
 And when you change the road, 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.170
 It is made but I can not control the degree of softness. 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.069
 I can not challenge you. 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.029
 Moving along with the location of the theater text 

00:02:40.029 --> 00:02:43.129
 You can not listen to ing cereals 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:46.039
 The computer will do fine. 

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:49.039
 When you go back to the 6th 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.459
 I want to make the euro smooth. 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.650
 So what should I do? 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.359
 You have to change it to basketball. Or 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:02:59.409
 Good 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:02.709
 It was an eBay match and you can adjust and ibm 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.809
 If you switch to eBay 

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:07.599
 It changes. 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:11.139
 It's not a cut line. 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.099
 I'm passing by the god of fire. 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:16.279
 There is 

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:19.649
 My face is worth 200 million points. 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:22.799
 Set up page-up points 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.039
 When you have three 

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:28.759
 Share the Seagate Segment attached to the difference 

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:31.759
 You can control it like that. 

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:35.659
 Likewise. 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:38.659
 If Gyeonggi-do is changed by foreigners 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:43.759
 I made a fool. 

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:45.289
 so 

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:47.169
 It's the first time I have to control it. 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:50.319
 Select all at once, bright and soft last time 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:52.189
 To you 

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:54.940
 Right button next time 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.199
 In the mind of the media 

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:58.659
 Performed honestly 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:01.879
 I will reveal. I'll adjust it from here on out. 

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:11.089
 When you see the original, 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.389
 I will not. 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:18.439
 I woke up together, but this part 

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:21.479
 This is where I left off. 

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:27.389
 Let's build it here. 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:30.389
 This is where you'll be going. 

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:34.620
 In front of an e-book, 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.100
 I could not make a card while I was angling 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.039
 I will make it to correspondence 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:42.449
 Zai prospecting households and making the flag soft 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:45.740
 So, when I go to freedom, 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.740
 I'm paying off my body 3 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:04:54.139
 The goal is to go up and down the page up in Science and Early 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:56.169
 Alliance 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:59.169
 will be. In the same case now 

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:04.229
 There is a sign that is considered to be. 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:07.699
 page up for me to do with my legs 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:10.699
 I want to move left and right. 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.020
 This is the main choice 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.389
 Yellow is yellow and yellow is yellow 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:19.879
 To fish 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:22.640
 There is another variable, but here 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.249
 I was able to catch the special. 20 years 

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:29.659
 Interested in education. As a family in red, give a penny to move 

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:30.930
 It's not possible 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.849
 In the case of 

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:36.040
 Broke if you use x keyboard 

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:37.839
 like that 

00:05:37.839 --> 00:05:40.919
 Yesterday and when I pointed out the instrument, 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:42.350
 It's marked. 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.999
 The fact that it's marked in red 

00:05:44.999 --> 00:05:47.059
 Alex can also be moved to the axis and can move white 

00:05:47.059 --> 00:05:50.059
 It is said. 

00:05:50.749 --> 00:05:53.749
 Extra in the natural state has become a Chinese taste 

00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:57.339
 The wine then turns red, and internally 

00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:01.429
 I can not believe the axis of death is moving. 

00:06:01.429 --> 00:06:02.789
 Can 

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:03.919
 again 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:06.919
 If you can recall the surplus of Fiji Maltese, 

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:09.709
 Please press the keyboard on the keyboard 

00:06:09.709 --> 00:06:12.789
 That is what it is. In the state, wait for xy to watch so that you can watch. 

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:14.860
 I give the external clock at once. 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.229
 Then 

00:06:16.229 --> 00:06:19.229
 Let's get to know the bases. 

00:06:21.399 --> 00:06:24.109
 If you move from ideal state to much more controlled 

00:06:24.109 --> 00:06:25.210
 I'm free 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.919
 But now this is not editable 

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:30.710
 I have to do it either way 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:31.889
 In the context of 

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:35.789
 I want you to call short-sex sex games 

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:38.789
 It was good. I'm working on the height. 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.789
 It was a homepage. 

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:45.400
 Let's save. 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.400
 Candidate after changing to Bay Area Corner. 

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:55.030
 Gyeonggi Province has a demand. 

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.080
 I've traditionally been knocking on the door. 

00:07:03.289 --> 00:07:05.580
 It's a democratic merit.
