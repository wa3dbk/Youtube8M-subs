tall or eight feet tall now there are

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.700 
tall or eight feet tall now there are
downsides<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.759> both<00:01:50.909> of<00:01:51.030> these<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.840> first<00:01:52.170> 13

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
downsides to both of these the first 13

downsides to both of these the first 13
feet<00:01:52.979> tall<00:01:53.189> obviously<00:01:53.939> life<00:01:54.780> is<00:01:54.960> going<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.170> be

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
feet tall obviously life is going to be

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.100 
feet tall obviously life is going to be
a<00:01:55.259> lot<00:01:55.680> more<00:01:55.710> difficult<00:01:56.630> sitting<00:01:57.630> on<00:01:57.689> shares

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
a lot more difficult sitting on shares

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.010 
a lot more difficult sitting on shares
driving<00:01:58.950> everything<00:01:59.430> yeah<00:02:00.210> if<00:02:00.600> you<00:02:00.689> guys<00:02:00.810> have

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020

seen the TV shows like there's people

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.109 
seen the TV shows like there's people
like<00:02:03.329> a<00:02:03.390> little<00:02:03.780> Dwarfs<00:02:04.320> or<00:02:04.469> whatever<00:02:05.119> life's

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
like a little Dwarfs or whatever life's

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.789 
like a little Dwarfs or whatever life's
pretty<00:02:06.240> difficult<00:02:06.570> they're<00:02:07.079> still<00:02:07.320> happy<00:02:07.530> and

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
pretty difficult they're still happy and

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.740 
pretty difficult they're still happy and
stuff<00:02:08.009> but<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:09.090> then<00:02:09.209> there's<00:02:09.360> eight<00:02:09.539> feet

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
stuff but and then there's eight feet

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.910 
stuff but and then there's eight feet
tall<00:02:09.929> eight<00:02:10.140> feet<00:02:10.349> tall<00:02:10.500> you<00:02:10.649> can<00:02:10.800> take

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
tall eight feet tall you can take

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.140 
tall eight feet tall you can take
advantage<00:02:11.039> of<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.520> little<00:02:11.730> bit

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
advantage of a little bit

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.399 
advantage of a little bit
so<00:02:12.360> if<00:02:12.420> you<00:02:12.510> tell<00:02:12.720> sure<00:02:12.989> you'd<00:02:13.140> be<00:02:13.170> good<00:02:13.349> at

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:13.409 
so if you tell sure you'd be good at

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:15.619 
so if you tell sure you'd be good at
hide<00:02:13.799> and<00:02:13.829> go<00:02:13.980> seek<00:02:14.040> stuff<00:02:14.549> like<00:02:14.700> that<00:02:14.730> but<00:02:15.450> a

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
hide and go seek stuff like that but a

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.770 
hide and go seek stuff like that but a
feet<00:02:15.870> tall<00:02:16.129> you<00:02:17.129> can<00:02:17.280> play<00:02:17.489> basketball<00:02:17.819> you

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
could be probably would probably really

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.000

fast but anyway basketball you win every

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.390 
fast but anyway basketball you win every

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
tall although there's one also downside

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.160

of<00:02:28.859> this<00:02:28.890> right<00:02:29.459> a<00:02:29.700> feet<00:02:30.269> tall<00:02:30.569> the<00:02:30.840> world's

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
of this right a feet tall the world's

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.289 
of this right a feet tall the world's
tallest<00:02:31.379> person<00:02:31.739> ended<00:02:32.220> up<00:02:32.370> dying<00:02:32.670> I<00:02:33.000> think<00:02:33.030> he

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
tallest person ended up dying I think he

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.119 
tallest person ended up dying I think he
was<00:02:33.390> like<00:02:33.569> I<00:02:33.810> don't<00:02:34.470> exactly<00:02:34.650> remember<00:02:34.859> how

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:35.129 
was like I don't exactly remember how

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.339 
was like I don't exactly remember how
holly<00:02:35.400> was<00:02:35.609> I<00:02:35.670> think<00:02:36.000> it's<00:02:36.120> around<00:02:36.180> 80<00:02:36.510> but

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
holly was I think it's around 80 but

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.589 
holly was I think it's around 80 but
correct<00:02:38.159> me<00:02:38.280> if<00:02:38.370> I'm<00:02:38.459> wrong<00:02:38.519> but<00:02:38.700> he<00:02:38.970> died<00:02:39.239> at<00:02:39.540> a

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
correct me if I'm wrong but he died at a

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.349 
correct me if I'm wrong but he died at a
fairly<00:02:40.079> young<00:02:40.260> age<00:02:40.470> because<00:02:40.890> of<00:02:41.220> the<00:02:42.030> blood

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:42.359 
fairly young age because of the blood

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:44.780 
fairly young age because of the blood
and<00:02:42.659> his<00:02:42.959> heart<00:02:43.349> couldn't<00:02:43.709> pump<00:02:44.069> enough<00:02:44.760> blood

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
and his heart couldn't pump enough blood

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.470 
and his heart couldn't pump enough blood
for<00:02:45.599> him<00:02:45.840> to<00:02:46.079> like<00:02:46.409> live<00:02:46.920> and<00:02:47.220> so<00:02:48.150> his<00:02:48.239> blood

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
for him to like live and so his blood

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.849 
for him to like live and so his blood
pressure<00:02:48.750> wasn't<00:02:49.170> high<00:02:49.319> enough<00:02:49.349> in<00:02:49.709> the<00:02:49.769> end

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:49.859 
pressure wasn't high enough in the end

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:53.750 
pressure wasn't high enough in the end
up<00:02:49.980> dying<00:02:50.310> but<00:02:51.269> if<00:02:51.540> I<00:02:51.829> would<00:02:52.829> not<00:02:53.129> die<00:02:53.430> I

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
up dying but if I would not die I

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.369 
up dying but if I would not die I
definitely<00:02:54.150> take<00:02:54.359> the<00:02:54.480> eight<00:02:54.629> feet<00:02:54.840> tall<00:02:55.019> if<00:02:55.260> I

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379 
definitely take the eight feet tall if I

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:57.500 
definitely take the eight feet tall if I
would<00:02:55.650> die<00:02:55.829> like<00:02:56.129> shorter<00:02:56.609> life<00:02:56.819> I'd<00:02:57.060> take

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
would die like shorter life I'd take

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.869 
would die like shorter life I'd take
three<00:02:57.750> feet<00:02:57.989> next<00:02:58.799> one<00:02:58.980> would<00:02:59.250> you<00:02:59.400> rather<00:02:59.579> be

able to stop time or fly now this is a
really<00:03:04.049> really<00:03:04.590> tough<00:03:04.920> stop<00:03:05.730> time<00:03:06.060> it's<00:03:06.840> not

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
really really tough stop time it's not

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.869 
really really tough stop time it's not
reversed<00:03:07.470> I'm<00:03:07.739> not<00:03:08.010> going<00:03:08.220> back<00:03:08.400> with<00:03:08.609> stop

time<00:03:09.150> at<00:03:09.389> any<00:03:09.659> time<00:03:09.959> possible<00:03:10.500> right<00:03:10.680> so<00:03:11.220> if

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
time at any time possible right so if

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.589 
time at any time possible right so if
you<00:03:11.340> guys<00:03:11.489> seen<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:11.879> movie<00:03:12.209> i<00:03:12.239> think<00:03:12.510> it's

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
you guys seen the movie i think it's

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:14.660 
you guys seen the movie i think it's
click<00:03:12.989> where<00:03:13.379> the<00:03:13.470> guy<00:03:13.590> can<00:03:13.799> stop<00:03:14.040> time<00:03:14.310> you

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
click where the guy can stop time you

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.819 
click where the guy can stop time you
can<00:03:14.790> fast<00:03:15.060> forward<00:03:15.209> and<00:03:15.569> stuff<00:03:15.780> if<00:03:16.680> you're

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
can fast forward and stuff if you're

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.819 
can fast forward and stuff if you're
stopping<00:03:17.129> time<00:03:17.519> any<00:03:17.940> test<00:03:18.720> you<00:03:18.870> take<00:03:19.230> you

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
stopping time any test you take you

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.009 
stopping time any test you take you
should<00:03:20.040> get<00:03:20.190> a<00:03:20.250> hundred<00:03:20.400> percent<00:03:20.549> okay<00:03:21.209> um

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
should get a hundred percent okay um

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.259 
should get a hundred percent okay um
there's<00:03:22.949> lots<00:03:23.280> of<00:03:23.400> things<00:03:23.459> we're<00:03:23.879> stopping

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
there's lots of things we're stopping

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:27.170 
there's lots of things we're stopping
time<00:03:24.419> would<00:03:24.629> help<00:03:24.930> in<00:03:25.139> education<00:03:26.040> past<00:03:26.879> that

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
time would help in education past that

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.780 
time would help in education past that
stopping<00:03:27.690> time<00:03:27.930> would<00:03:28.829> it<00:03:28.859> really<00:03:29.129> be<00:03:29.220> super

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
stopping time would it really be super

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.939 
stopping time would it really be super
useful<00:03:30.000> I<00:03:30.629> don't<00:03:31.230> know<00:03:31.319> maybe<00:03:31.530> when<00:03:31.829> you're

people say that drowning can be peaceful
as<00:06:51.110> well<00:06:51.289> right<00:06:51.620> so<00:06:52.219> it<00:06:52.430> depends<00:06:53.060> what<00:06:53.360> what

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:53.930 
as well right so it depends what what

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:56.800 
as well right so it depends what what
you're<00:06:54.050> coming<00:06:54.259> from<00:06:54.469> I<00:06:54.770> have<00:06:55.250> no<00:06:55.699> clue<00:06:56.000> if<00:06:56.330> I

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:56.810 
you're coming from I have no clue if I

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:59.350 
you're coming from I have no clue if I
were<00:06:56.930> to<00:06:57.020> pass<00:06:57.229> out<00:06:57.530> it<00:06:57.919> definitely<00:06:58.819> be<00:06:59.030> fire

00:06:59.350 --> 00:06:59.360 
were to pass out it definitely be fire

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.800 
were to pass out it definitely be fire
right<00:06:59.990> because<00:07:00.889> just<00:07:01.569> passing<00:07:02.569> out<00:07:02.690> you

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:02.810 
right because just passing out you

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:04.899 
right because just passing out you
wouldn't<00:07:03.139> know<00:07:03.319> what's<00:07:03.620> happening<00:07:03.979> if<00:07:04.190> you're

00:07:04.899 --> 00:07:04.909 
wouldn't know what's happening if you're

00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:07.089 
wouldn't know what's happening if you're
drowning<00:07:05.300> in<00:07:05.659> depends<00:07:05.960> of<00:07:06.020> its<00:07:06.139> peaceful<00:07:06.680> or

00:07:07.089 --> 00:07:07.099 
drowning in depends of its peaceful or

00:07:07.099 --> 00:07:09.820 
drowning in depends of its peaceful or
really<00:07:07.550> like<00:07:07.789> frantic<00:07:08.629> so<00:07:09.289> I<00:07:09.440> don't<00:07:09.650> know<00:07:09.710> I

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:09.830 
really like frantic so I don't know I

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:12.369 
really like frantic so I don't know I
think<00:07:09.949> I'd<00:07:10.460> have<00:07:10.669> to<00:07:10.819> go<00:07:10.909> with<00:07:10.940> fire<00:07:11.379> just

00:07:12.369 --> 00:07:12.379 
think I'd have to go with fire just

00:07:12.379 --> 00:07:14.589 
think I'd have to go with fire just
because<00:07:12.800> after<00:07:13.340> a<00:07:13.370> certain<00:07:13.639> pain<00:07:14.030> threshold

00:07:14.589 --> 00:07:14.599 
because after a certain pain threshold

00:07:14.599 --> 00:07:17.200 
because after a certain pain threshold
you<00:07:14.750> wouldn't<00:07:15.080> feel<00:07:15.259> any<00:07:15.469> longer<00:07:15.889> so<00:07:16.610> anyways

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:17.210 
you wouldn't feel any longer so anyways
