00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.200 
everywhere I don't really know about
that<00:01:34.409> but<00:01:34.619> also<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.250> fact<00:01:35.460> that<00:01:35.579> we<00:01:35.729> see<00:01:36.030> this

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
that but also the fact that we see this

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.380 
that but also the fact that we see this
on<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.479> Xbox<00:01:37.320> one<00:01:37.770> also<00:01:38.579> implies<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:38.970> the

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
on the Xbox one also implies that the

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.420 
on the Xbox one also implies that the
ps4<00:01:39.840> version<00:01:40.680> will<00:01:40.829> be<00:01:40.860> out<00:01:40.979> very<00:01:41.100> soon

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
ps4 version will be out very soon

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.219 
ps4 version will be out very soon
because<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:42.150> think<00:01:42.210> some<00:01:42.570> time<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.840> while<00:01:43.200> back

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
because I think some time a while back

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.870 
because I think some time a while back
they<00:01:43.649> said<00:01:43.799> they're<00:01:43.979> gonna<00:01:44.040> try<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.430> release

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
they said they're gonna try to release

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.060 
they said they're gonna try to release
the<00:01:45.119> updates<00:01:45.570> for<00:01:45.750> those<00:01:45.899> games<00:01:46.170> around<00:01:46.890> the

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
the updates for those games around the

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.800 
the updates for those games around the
same<00:01:47.310> time<00:01:47.340> so<00:01:47.880> I'm<00:01:48.119> guessing<00:01:48.420> they're<00:01:48.720> gonna

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
same time so I'm guessing they're gonna

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.539 
same time so I'm guessing they're gonna
try<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.200> release<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.829> games<00:01:50.040> at<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.280> same

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
try to release the games at the same

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.850 
try to release the games at the same
time<00:01:50.759> for<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.060> Xbox<00:01:51.420> one<00:01:51.570> in<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.720> ps4<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:52.320> don't
