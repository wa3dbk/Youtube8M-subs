 in order not to start calling me love call me people much simpler 

00:00:31.639 --> 00:00:34.639
 I wanted to tell you something important 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.720
 to pass the desire to do sports 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.840
 today for the first time I had the feeling of dying 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.360
 when the most discharged battery for the engine is salty orkut 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.930
 the car swerves I thought I could no longer control it 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.440

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.090

 bad you want weight of a motorcycle with a dead battery 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.180
 because that red electrically welded papapapapa sign 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.720
 papapapapapapapa 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.240
 it was what I lost control of 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.420
 Drought 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.420

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.540

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.940

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.030

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.490
 new sure that he has already solved everything that does not need others 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.770
 then and then you've seen from above the sex and the city series 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.340
 here I dropped 200 g 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.540
 I didn't want to strain 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.130
 I thought my mother is 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.730

 I didn't think of you if you need to know 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.110
 I thought instead that I could bit 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.520
 today for the first time I really felt that I could more 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.010
 maybe that's why you don't want it 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.440
 when I was in the lead from sawed the advantage I forced to 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.750

 there is only strong wind 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.609
 who slaps as if he wanted to make you faster than everyone

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:13.749
 but you won by 

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:15.889

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:19.829
