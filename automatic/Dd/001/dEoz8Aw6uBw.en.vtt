 hey people welcome to candido and 

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:06.230
 to offer our lego city story 

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:08.120
 hide in the marsh the three crooks 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.460
 Schoki Langfinger and Betty have just been 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.910
 your hideaway in the marsh reaches times 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:12.910
 see what happens 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:35.240
 slow now slowly now 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:35.240
 all out of here I wait first 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.830
 langfinger brings the backpack with the 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.430
 banknotes in the safe hideaway 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:49.980
 code is 382 we'll be right back 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:54.420
 for the situation review everything clear 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.220
 I wish on the way but there 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:03.000
 Let's put off the fat booty 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:04.739
 what chef you again said 3824 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:14.190
 for correctly noted now it would have to 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:14.730
 so go there once in with the coal so that 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.610
 I am 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.230
 you have already made coffee great me 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:24.090
 I'm curious what the boss to announce 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:27.240
 so does people have something like this i have 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:31.510
 ever the map so the point you 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:34.570
 that's our hiding place and there 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:39.400
 there should be a crystal control 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:43.470
 let's give ourselves what was that 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.470
 That sounds like a helicopter 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:02:00.250
 We have almost no longer here 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.760
 but with our dare that should not 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.760
 be a problem 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:14.560
 what are we doing now? 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:16.480

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.740
 safe to boot but nice and careful 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.000

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.030

 I 'm already doing the boat plan 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:33.959

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:50.180

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:58.620
