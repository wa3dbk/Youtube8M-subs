00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:15.969
 Solothurn I had a few hundred dead times 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:19.140
 he and Hamilton had 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.140
 insufficient come start 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:25.539
 Jürgen Wolter also still a lot ahead 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:28.179
 I only exceeded experiments 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:31.179
 well over two fly with one stone 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:35.060
 she counted herself to have done everything 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.060
 So Grommes will get in 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.960
 and no matter that Helena Maier 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.960
 worry is empty 

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.170
 Somehow Lohmüller succeeded in doing good Rome 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:50.300
 and 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.320
 not only are it necessary 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.320
 when he's in the middle of it 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.240
 Euro clear 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.230
 as meant Schleck 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.990
 but not true 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.060
 Of course, the "critical" is clear 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.390
 electricity was left to swim for them 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.390
 she was his 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.910

 Radig is 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.830
 behind it more corner 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:43.490
 then again 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.490
 this is supposed to be the one that comes in the middle of it is totally cheese 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.830
 they rose against it now I have not been true 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.790
 why are you just fully ran 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.360
 safe to promote 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:12.909
 because who can be through that 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:15.909
 Marco de 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:20.509

 I want you 

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:53.649

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:31.089

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:39.059
 Dachshund here 

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:41.909

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:44.429
 that will not be forgotten 

00:03:44.429 --> 00:03:47.429
