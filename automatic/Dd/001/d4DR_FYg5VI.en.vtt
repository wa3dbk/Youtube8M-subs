00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.319
 Hello, friends, I'm copper fix and 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.910
 this video we are going to make a pendrive 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:11.790
 to be able to install ubuntu 13.04 or 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.440
 try it in life mode for it we 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.440
 let's direct to this page 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.720
 linux live.com 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.150
 since we need a program in 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.730
 windows in my case is windows 8 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:31.630
 here where we see download lily and you 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:34.020
 we give is version 2.8 point 21 in this 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.020
 moment 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.010
 and we executed the installer that we were 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.010
 discharge 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.720
 we wait for it to download 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.920
 ok and the installer opens 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:56.710
 asking for the language I leave them in 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.520
 Spanish 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.890
 we give the next 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.540
 the default installation path is 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.379
 we can change it if we want and we 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.379
 we give the next 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.970
 it's a very simple process is the 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.970
 installation as always in windows 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.580
 completed we give to next and now 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:22.120
 we give to let marked 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:24.510
 linux live and it will open 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.940
 I'm going to close the page 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:31.490
 and here we have it good it does not look very 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.490
 alright I'm going to open some house in the background 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.580
 here we have it 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.390
 this program already has 5 steps but they are 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.900
 very simple 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:45.640
 the first is to choose the destination a 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.640
 moment that I put the device 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.860
 in my case it is a pendrive of 4 GB 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.020
 I'm going to give you here update so that 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:59.020
 update 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.860
 here I have it 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:08.290
 we choose the pendrive or usb device 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:14.880
 I will choose in step 2 the iso image 

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:14.880
 of Ubuntu 13.04 in its 64-bit version 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.160
 check it check the image and know 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:24.660
 what ubuntu is going to install or what 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.660
 Linux distribution in the USA 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:32.140
 and verify that it is version 13.04 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:35.920
 we went to step 3 which would be the size of 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:38.800
 persistence if we give it predetermined 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.510
 comes in 0 which is only live mode only 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.680
 start and you're 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:47.350
 we can use the ubuntu system and if 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:51.269
 we want to install it just try it but 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:54.819
 if we give persistence memory 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:57.350
 when we create some file of 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:00.260
 wifi setting 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.819
 of another type or install something 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.069
 will keep 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:06.160
 I'm not interested so I'm going to spend 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:09.280
 to step 4 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:11.740
 what is a series of options there is one that 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.290
 is to hide the created files so that 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:18.310
 we can continue using the pendrive 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:20.730
 without bothering me I leave it marked another 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.890
 which is to format the device in fat32 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.460
 that will erase the data and I had another 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:29.610
 installation done before 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:31.700
 before this video 1 of test then you 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.739
 I'm going to format 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.160
 and this option from here will activate the 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:40.400
 initial is that when we put the 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:44.700
 pendrive in a windows system opens 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:48.750
 an emulation terminal with with ubuntu 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:52.200
 and well step 5 would already be lightning 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.019
 this and the pendrive is created as we give it 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:59.209
 to format it asks me if it really 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:59.209
 I'm sure and I'll accept 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:06.210
 now it takes about 23 minutes depends on 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:09.300
 the speed of our pendrive or 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:11.750
 USB device will take a little longer a 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.750
 little less 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.980
 Well, it has finished passing the 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:26.120
 pendrive image 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.120
 It is ending 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:33.860
 and it's over once it ends 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.860
 a website opens with a guide 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.800
 of the steps that we have to do that 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:43.280
 they are not others that put the device 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:45.260
 usb on our computer and when it is 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.600
 booting you can configure it so that 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:50.110
 boot from the pendrive depends on 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:52.630
 our bios 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:55.060
 there will be a button for this we have to 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:59.050
 configure them in the disk priority 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:00.830
 hard that already depends on each motherboard or 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.990
 motherboard 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.000
 and well that's all friends then like 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:08.060
 You see, it's very easy to prepare a 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:12.920
 usb device to enjoy this 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:15.770
 great system ubuntu 13.04 that has been 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:20.170
 I hope everything will be useful and we 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:20.170
 we see in another video until another
