00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
also what I wanted to mention is this

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.260 
also what I wanted to mention is this

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
happens to be a nice key for me to sing

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:29.000 
happens to be a nice key for me to sing
in<00:04:27.419> and<00:04:27.630> that's<00:04:28.110> the<00:04:28.260> most<00:04:28.410> important<00:04:28.860> thing

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
in and that's the most important thing

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.150 
in and that's the most important thing
is<00:04:29.190> if<00:04:29.430> I<00:04:29.520> can<00:04:29.820> sing<00:04:30.090> it<00:04:30.230> relatively<00:04:31.230> well<00:04:31.380> but

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
is if I can sing it relatively well but

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.379 
is if I can sing it relatively well but
