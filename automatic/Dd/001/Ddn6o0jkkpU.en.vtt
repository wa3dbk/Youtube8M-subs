00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.330
 we are here now on the 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.060
 mercedes stand or was unveiled on 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.699
 class s cut out of a class s cut that 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.560
 is different from the sedan by all these 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.810
 swarovski crystals that end up 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.630
 in the lighthouses we have 47 in total 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.560
 between flashers and women bah 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.510
 you want high end 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.890
 there you have high-end for the 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.690
 style we still went from one 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.610
 real big calf that once had 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.530
 to a whale can no longer and sids 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.600
 so everyone who laughs rhombus 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.820
 renault 1 the star mercedes 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.989
 it takes enormous proportions and not 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.670
 we still stay on a car that 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.020
 is more than five meters long it 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.120
 its compact and compared to before but 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.420
 it remains a beautiful baby a real big beautiful 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.340
 baby 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.110
 but what really distinguishes the 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.760
 class s cut off from all others 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.079
 cars of this range there is his 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.860
 technological equipment and that for 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.510
 the wind will have to go to 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.760
 inside and so I'm going to be 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:04.470
 forced to evacuate people sometimes 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.519
 unpleasantly good they are great and 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.570
 beefy we will wait a little longer 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.150
 before going back we will talk engine 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.590
 so this model comes with only one 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.230
 engine for now it's a v8 4 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:17.160
 liters 6 2 455 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:18.390
 2,455 horses and 720 naked storm that's a 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.310
 big baby it's a big game that goes 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.720
 to have a little trouble moving the 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.110
 two tons of gear but it will be 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.180
 sufficient 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.230
 we linger for a while on the 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.090
 back part which is the biggest 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.460
 change of the car some 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.050
 speak of a cut laguna inspiration 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.750
 there are only bad languages ​​for the 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.550
 say fast aboard the class s cut 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.990
 who fights always distinguishes from the 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:38.820
 sedan share a few small touches 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.400
 particular so this steering wheel of three 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.320
 sleeves for the rest we are in front 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.370
 the giant screen of the class s is pretty much 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.050
 near the same thing the dashboard 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.670
 is about the same also we have a 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.710
 glazed roof the acquired also specific to 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.140
 this model and we mostly made it a 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.220
 chassis that is the same who adopt 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.990
 all possible technologies and 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.270
 imaginable already developed on the class 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.440
 s whose particular inclination in 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:04.320
 turn called magic control a 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.570
 system that also allows to test the 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.210
 route via gps via radars for 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.210
 adapt the suspension to the boss that you 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.480
 go meet that's enough 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.750
 scary 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.550
 short if you like luxury cars 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.660
 if you have no more children at home 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.520
 because there behind we are not big 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.480
 world 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.480
 the class s cut is not bad 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.000
 the
