00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 once as you see the title we are going to 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:07.069
 do the speed test between these 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.069
 two s 4 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:16.529
 I do not know how to act welcome again to 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.320
 your best technology channel and if you follow 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.930
 being super but super good wave dale 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.060
 a great life and good people let's see 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.519
 what is speed test for these 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.109
 two phones to actually see what is 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.810
 faster since we have two versions 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.940
 is the customer is the ebro line 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.800
 and that has a lot to do with some things 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.020
 like cameras things like that do not change 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.520
 but the processors sometimes yes in that 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.600
 we want to show you the first thing 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.700
 let's do is close all 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.320
 completely have nothing running 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.629
 we are also going to do everything that is 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.120
 running in rne so that completely 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.559
 be clean the phone we will do 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.629
 the same with this phone in front 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.960
 all of you to see what it is 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.690
 plus 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.540
 real possible the verizon if you are going to have 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.129
 a small advantage since it is a 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.350
 completely new phone we have not 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.420
 charged nothing from phone then it has 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.880
 a certain advantage but let's look at 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:10.300
 reality how much that advantage is 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.180
 let's see also let's use this 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.860
 application that is called antonio 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.720
 benchmark that is one that measures graphs and 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.210
 all things very opening up to the 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.369
 same time actually to see which one 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.550
 works better this one had already given us 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.899
 previously to test it then 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.570
 it's going to be the first time we're going to 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:30.130
 do then this the mahler is already 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.080
 well it's going to be try again this 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:33.580
 it will be narrow to see in reality 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.550
 which is faster, let's do this in 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.289
 in front of all of you hopefully you give us 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:42.119
 a good result to see what is the 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:42.119
 result rather let's start now 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.860
 and there we are thanks 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.020
 yes 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.609
 yes 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.320
 here is not going to matter which 

00:01:55.609 --> 00:02:00.530
 finish first but it will give us the 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:03.609
 result of the application of which one is going to 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.609
 be the phone better 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:12.540
 AHA 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.670
 well as we saw there I was trying the 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.040
 ccp now let's see the graphics what 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.600
 so good holds graphics that is the 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.010
 process that is following here as they 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.990
 I say no matter which one ends first 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.490
 because I started one before the other but 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.040
 the final result that will give us 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:39.590
 is going to give a number that is the score of 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.590
 which is or which one is best 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.620
 plus 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.860
 how many frames per se who is 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.310
 running or being frames per second is 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.180
 running at almost 60 duty that index 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:59.280
 he is practically also agreeing 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.280
 to 60 59 points 35 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.439
 and more 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.040
 this application is completely free 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.480
 in android it can be left in the 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.100
 description so that they download it it 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.470
 they want to put on their cell phone and see how 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.330
 fast is to adapt to the iphone is also 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.080
 available but it has a cost I think 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:20.080
 of 2 dollars 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.219
 plus 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.680
 try the whole phone meditate as you see 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.320
 is running what is lcd so 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.480
 fast reads the s of sd memories 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.590
 then everything runs to the test 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.450
 then very excellent phone 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:41.670
 application if you want to actually see what 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:44.610
 so good your cell phone the radio 24.515 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:48.060
 in that it was what it is and there it gives us to 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:50.520
 ram gpu and cpu and the rest then everything 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.020
 the operating system of the area gave 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.310
 five star very excellent one of the 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:56.480
 best phones in the market to 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.340
 wait pointed out gives us the haiti in you 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.760
 then I can see other phones and that 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.620
 he saw us in 24 thousand 562 and that which has been 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.840
 a phone that we have loaded a lot 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.360
 more things and things like that is so obvious a 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.450
 school a little higher and quini by 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:14.460
 very little, that is not much difference 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.680
 but here we can notice the ram in the 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.570
 phone that is clean to run a lot 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.609
 faster then also the system 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.200
 operative in this embryo the system 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.030
 operative maybe much cleaner in the 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.830
 version of bryson not doing in search 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.990
 a phone that is cleaner than you are 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.710
 to run a little faster could be 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.710
 the program 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.660
 to what if I win here was what it was 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.540
 in gpu then maybe the system 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:38.640
 operational here is much what is the 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.230
 hardware is better at what that is 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:42.480
 they change the plates all that very 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.760
 different and if we go back and we 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.650
 we will char the two options we 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:49.050
 they give two phones that they have tried and then 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.750
 to submit what your tests are 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.490
 your own phone the s4 in the world of 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:55.650
 this application has been the fastest 

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:57.090
 who have tried htc one follows him maybe 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.010
 on all the phones for all that 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.510
 they say no to my phone faster than that 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.860
 are all the tests of which they have 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.960
 done with this application in my 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.970
 preferences but actually that 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.590
 both renders the phone is a super 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.390
 application also if they want to go to 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.190
 try for your android too for there 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.720
 webs but has a cost well with 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.210
 that we are saying goodbye in this test 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.310
 of speed the winner in this case was 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.960
 katy in you but price of a monster that 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.820
 your ramen much faster go to 

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.320
 check all those things people see 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.030
 until next time this was proof of 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.800
 floral speed against and teeth and 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.450
 we see you make sure to check our 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.980
 my family channel you just 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:31.260
 start second season see you 

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:34.220
 until next time your server and if not 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.220
 you already knew the
