00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
of PVC a street 90 that went into a 1

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.859 
of PVC a street 90 that went into a 1
inch<00:00:23.730> by<00:00:23.970> 2<00:00:24.029> inch<00:00:25.220> adapter<00:00:26.220> and<00:00:26.939> then<00:00:27.510> that<00:00:27.689> was

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
inch by 2 inch adapter and then that was

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.189 
inch by 2 inch adapter and then that was
in<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.289> 2<00:00:28.349> by<00:00:28.830> 3<00:00:29.390> adapter<00:00:30.390> for<00:00:30.539> going<00:00:30.779> in<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:30.929> 3

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.020 
in a 2 by 3 adapter for going in a 3
inch<00:00:31.380> and<00:00:31.560> then<00:00:31.679> there<00:00:31.800> was<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:31.920> 3<00:00:32.219> by<00:00:32.340> 4<00:00:32.369> to

inch and then there was a 3 by 4 to
allow<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.480> put<00:00:33.660> it<00:00:33.780> into<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.079> 4<00:00:34.410> inch<00:00:34.559> sewer

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
allow you to put it into a 4 inch sewer

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.440 
allow you to put it into a 4 inch sewer
main<00:00:35.010> so<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.340> could<00:00:35.550> put<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:35.730> into<00:00:35.940> anything

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
main so you could put it into anything

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.619 
main so you could put it into anything
that<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:37.440> see<00:00:37.649> at<00:00:37.739> your<00:00:37.770> campground<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.629> the

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
that you see at your campground and the

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.740 
that you see at your campground and the
whole<00:00:39.950> basis<00:00:40.950> of<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.219> mechanism<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.329> takes

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
whole basis of the mechanism is it takes

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.130 
whole basis of the mechanism is it takes
regular<00:00:43.440> old<00:00:43.800> water<00:00:44.160> out<00:00:44.430> of<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.789> hose<00:00:45.570> bib<00:00:45.899> and

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
regular old water out of a hose bib and

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.060 
regular old water out of a hose bib and
your<00:00:47.039> yard<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.700> pressurizes<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:49.050> you<00:00:49.950> know

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
your yard and pressurizes it to you know

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.729 
your yard and pressurizes it to you know
make<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.730> water<00:00:51.059> power<00:00:51.360> macerating<00:00:52.260> pump<00:00:54.410> so<00:00:55.410> it

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
make a water power macerating pump so it

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.910 
make a water power macerating pump so it
comes<00:00:55.890> with<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.100> 10<00:00:56.340> foot<00:00:56.370> clear<00:00:56.789> hose<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.920> the

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
comes with a 10 foot clear hose and the

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.330 
comes with a 10 foot clear hose and the
jet<00:00:59.309> that<00:01:00.440> next<00:01:01.440> basically<00:01:01.920> neck's<00:01:02.190> your

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
jet that next basically neck's your

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.750 
jet that next basically neck's your
water<00:01:02.579> down<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.199> fine<00:01:04.199> spray<00:01:04.799> where<00:01:05.610> it's

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
water down to a fine spray where it's

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.120 
water down to a fine spray where it's
pressurized<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.530> instructions<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.740> mean

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
pressurized and instructions I mean

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.510 
pressurized and instructions I mean
that's<00:01:08.369> basically<00:01:08.700> all<00:01:09.060> that's<00:01:09.420> in<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.659> box

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
that's basically all that's in the box

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.609 
that's basically all that's in the box
so<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.549> had<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.210> because<00:01:13.080> I<00:01:13.140> didn't<00:01:13.320> have<00:01:13.409> enough

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
so I had to because I didn't have enough

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.240 
so I had to because I didn't have enough
grade<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.100> run<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.869> drain<00:01:15.869> out<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.320> my<00:01:16.470> driveway

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
grade to run a drain out to my driveway

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.700 
grade to run a drain out to my driveway
I<00:01:17.640> had<00:01:17.909> to<00:01:18.180> neck<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:18.780> down<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.140> one-inch<00:01:19.500> PVC

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
I had to neck it down to a one-inch PVC

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.620 
I had to neck it down to a one-inch PVC
which<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:20.369> recommends<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:20.939> it<00:01:21.030> can<00:01:21.150> do<00:01:21.270> up<00:01:21.479> to

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
which it recommends that it can do up to

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.929 
which it recommends that it can do up to
100<00:01:21.930> feet<00:01:22.080> right<00:01:22.650> here<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:22.860> have<00:01:23.009> about<00:01:23.100> 14<00:01:23.700> feet

100 feet right here I have about 14 feet

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.469 
100 feet right here I have about 14 feet
of<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.259> the<00:01:25.259> hose<00:01:25.500> is<00:01:25.770> about<00:01:26.180> 3/4<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.270> an<00:01:27.390> inch

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
of it the hose is about 3/4 of an inch

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.480 
of it the hose is about 3/4 of an inch
diameter<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.619> comes<00:01:28.829> with<00:01:29.009> it<00:01:29.130> it's<00:01:29.250> ten
