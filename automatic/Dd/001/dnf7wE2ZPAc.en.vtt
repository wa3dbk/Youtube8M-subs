find that the prices and costs will rock
it<00:00:57.960> up<00:00:58.260> significantly<00:00:58.859> so<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.699> goal<00:00:59.879> is<00:00:59.910> to

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
it up significantly so the goal is to

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.360 
it up significantly so the goal is to
purchase<00:01:00.359> yourself<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:01.260> high-end<00:01:01.949> computer
