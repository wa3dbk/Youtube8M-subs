bulb<00:01:22.400> was<00:01:22.460> invented<00:01:22.600> by<00:01:23.600> Edison<00:01:23.960> and<00:01:24.050> that<00:01:24.140> was

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
bulb was invented by Edison and that was

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.900 
bulb was invented by Edison and that was
a<00:01:24.290> sudden<00:01:24.530> moment<00:01:24.770> something<00:01:25.190> being<00:01:25.430> wow<00:01:25.700> we

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:25.910 
a sudden moment something being wow we

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.570 
a sudden moment something being wow we
have<00:01:26.030> this<00:01:26.120> idea<00:01:26.480> so<00:01:27.440> that's<00:01:27.650> how<00:01:27.860> I<00:01:27.890> look<00:01:28.460> like

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
have this idea so that's how I look like

that
the<00:01:30.290> energy-efficient<00:01:30.890> light<00:01:31.040> bulb<00:01:31.280> was

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
the energy-efficient light bulb was

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.940 
the energy-efficient light bulb was
invented<00:01:31.460> more<00:01:31.910> of<00:01:32.210> a<00:01:32.360> more<00:01:32.900> a<00:01:32.930> slower<00:01:33.470> car

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
invented more of a more a slower car

of Mount Everest because the sea levels

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.920 
of Mount Everest because the sea levels
have<00:03:26.670> risen<00:03:26.820> that<00:03:27.090> much<00:03:27.269> I<00:03:27.420> did<00:03:27.540> it<00:03:27.630> back<00:03:27.720> in<00:03:27.750> em

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
have risen that much I did it back in em

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:28.460 
have risen that much I did it back in em
out

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
out

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.760

according<00:03:28.800> to<00:03:28.830> the<00:03:29.400> film<00:03:29.640> 2012<00:03:29.940> account<00:03:30.480> and

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:30.770 
according to the film 2012 account and

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.110 
according to the film 2012 account and
so<00:03:31.770> it<00:03:31.830> rises<00:03:31.980> so<00:03:32.160> much<00:03:32.250> there's<00:03:32.430> one<00:03:32.580> pub<00:03:32.850> left

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
so it rises so much there's one pub left

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.460
