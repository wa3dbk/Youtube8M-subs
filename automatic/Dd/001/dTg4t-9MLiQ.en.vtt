00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
is metal the build quality is very much

is metal the build quality is very much
unsampled<00:03:09.290> like<00:03:09.769> I<00:03:10.040> would<00:03:10.340> like<00:03:10.489> to<00:03:10.640> say

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
unsampled like I would like to say

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.300 
unsampled like I would like to say
