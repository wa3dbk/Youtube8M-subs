00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
to the look this type is also very soft

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.280 
to the look this type is also very soft
and<00:01:58.460> the<00:01:58.610> material<00:01:59.330> is<00:01:59.420> very<00:01:59.450> light<00:01:59.930> which<00:02:00.260> is

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
and the material is very light which is

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:02.800 
and the material is very light which is
perfect<00:02:00.740> for<00:02:00.770> spring<00:02:01.130> I<00:02:01.370> have<00:02:02.330> my<00:02:02.480> hair<00:02:02.660> in<00:02:02.750> a

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
perfect for spring I have my hair in a

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.130 
perfect for spring I have my hair in a
twisted<00:02:03.200> side<00:02:03.500> braid<00:02:04.210> and<00:02:05.210> I<00:02:05.540> think<00:02:05.750> the<00:02:05.840> braid

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
twisted side braid and I think the braid

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.109 
twisted side braid and I think the braid
just<00:02:06.470> goes<00:02:06.650> along<00:02:06.800> well<00:02:07.400> with<00:02:07.640> this<00:02:07.880> very

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
just goes along well with this very

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.270 
just goes along well with this very
casual<00:02:08.750> look<00:02:08.929> because<00:02:09.320> it<00:02:09.470> is<00:02:09.590> a<00:02:09.619> bit<00:02:09.890> more<00:02:10.040> of

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
casual look because it is a bit more of

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.380 
casual look because it is a bit more of
a<00:02:10.700> messy<00:02:10.970> braid<00:02:12.700> have<00:02:13.700> a<00:02:13.730> nun<00:02:13.880> pair<00:02:14.120> of<00:02:14.210> blue

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
a messy braid have a nun pair of blue

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.180 
a messy braid have a nun pair of blue
jeans<00:02:14.420> I<00:02:14.930> just<00:02:15.200> added<00:02:15.350> by<00:02:15.530> a<00:02:15.560> braid<00:02:15.830> about

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
jeans I just added by a braid about

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.360 
jeans I just added by a braid about
because<00:02:17.090> this<00:02:17.270> strike<00:02:17.570> is<00:02:18.010> off-white<00:02:19.010> and

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
because this strike is off-white and

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.280 
because this strike is off-white and
ashy<00:02:19.790> gray<00:02:20.120> I<00:02:20.270> thought<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:20.540> brown<00:02:20.720> color<00:02:20.990> adds

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
ashy gray I thought the brown color adds

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.310 
ashy gray I thought the brown color adds
to<00:02:21.710> this<00:02:22.340> old<00:02:22.670> and<00:02:22.940> vintage<00:02:23.120> look<00:02:23.780> of<00:02:24.080> the

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
shirt folded up the bottom of my pants

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.860 
shirt folded up the bottom of my pants
because<00:02:28.310> I<00:02:28.370> think<00:02:28.520> it<00:02:28.760> adds<00:02:28.940> a<00:02:29.180> summer<00:02:29.570> and

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870
