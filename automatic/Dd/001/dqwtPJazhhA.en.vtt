00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.000
 everyone knows that today we are 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.590
 find times boys in use 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.830
 today we will therefore still talk to 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.289
 about gta 5 on this new dlc t 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.710
 she these robberies who maybe he 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:23.189
 will arrive tomorrow actually on the 24th 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:26.070
 February since actually rockstar has 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.599
 announced that this dlc the robbery will have to 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.219
 go out a few weeks before the date 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.660
 official release of gta 5 on pc and 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.440
 if we look good knowing also that 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.540
 rockstar often puts and dlc the 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.160
 Tuesday we can possibly say to ourselves 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.640
 because it's about March 24 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.270
 for the pc the platform pci 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.950
 working dust a few 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.530
 weeks before that can be no one like 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.469
 tomorrow or in any case maybe on tuesday 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.730
 next and it's late and it's here 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.440
 very little time in the world should 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.820
 find with some new images 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.489
 that I will show you on the screen 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.719
 very very interesting and besides 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.660
 things that I had talked about before 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.760
 and who come back as the iq so 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.380
 images that were either indicated I 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.720
 you showed seven first images that 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.729
 show not much by cons so 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.350
 it's up to you to make your own 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.720
 ideas as can be seen also 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.840
 we are always on the same person on 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.060
 twitter fun mw2 just who 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.320
 allies that's a lot of things here 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.180
 I will pass you on the other hand to the 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.159
 second image we can see just 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.290
 a little lullaby so that will be for 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.549
 of course the steering mode to enter 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.479
 in some places and all of you 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.950
 go see what actually makes it finally 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.710
 there will be a lot 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.140
 accessories in any case from what has 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.000
 been leaked maybe it's feq 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.659
 that's for sure but it's true that it 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.659
 appears earlier 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.750
 in any case if it is because 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:48.990
 it 's sacred finally it's big fake 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.400
 stuck here it must be done with 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.050
 this little person you will see 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.360
 so with the next picture on the other hand 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.100
 there we start to see really stuff 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.890
 we can see an assault rifle a 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.000
 shotgun with a kind of revolver 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.430
 but I think it's more stuff 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.020
 distress but that's not what 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.369
 I'm most interested in what 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.670
 I'm most interested in it's going to be 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:11.209
 the three objects we find a plus 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.660
 bottom right of the image we already have 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.520
 the identity card 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.230
 I had a lot of talk before 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.720
 so this possibility also by 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.970
 example of taking for example the map 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.550
 identity finally after passing from this 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.410
 map there ben will also give you access to 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.700
 some doors to be able to by 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.160
 example unlock all and for 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.830
 may be able to go in the trunk 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.510
 strong of the bank and what they can 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.700
 really you give yourself down especially 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.110
 easier than doing everything 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.660
 explode so after that it will be up to you to 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.150
 normally choose that they will be 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.260
 finally what are really your goals 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.140
 is it more than doing a 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.239
 steering mission using force 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.480
 or rather the discretion can notice 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:54.090
 so normally that I think it's 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.739
 infrared goggles or something 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.810
 that style we could also see in 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.220
 the trailer where all of a sudden there was 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.829
 infrared goggles to see in 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.480
 the black a camp esi when he was on 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:05.579
 the boat more exactly in the 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.079
 trailer is so it's true that these 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:08.880
 light scenes or when I saw this object 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:10.530
 there I said to myself ah that's pretty much 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.709
 the same with a kind of mask to 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.910
 gas normally on the right 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.900
 so it's true that it does not hurt to 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.640
 little things I do not know what you 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.170
 think but I think it's just that 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.150
 it's really interesting and it has 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.470
 seem to be rather real we end up 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.540
 so this new images that has us 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.579
 shared also assault rifle at the bottom 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.959
 with masks on the right of course 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:30.930
 to remain anonymous 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.459
 during the robbery elsewhere that we can 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.200
 besides make robberies and where end 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:38.030
 little roles tope right now 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.590
 on gta 5 and that takes away stars 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.910
 the mask I think it's just a 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.579
 star but here you go 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:45.600
 and also a computer that will be pretty 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:48.030
 important because there may be 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.919
 little tricks to honestly hack it 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.199
 we had talked a lot before with 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:55.109
 also a small explosive of small 

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:56.579
 explosive who will be present to make 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:59.070
 some steps 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:01.109
 we can also see in this 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.100
 last picture simply a kind 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:04.169
 small headset 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:07.799
 in my opinion that will allow you to be in 

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:10.049
 communication with your colleagues during 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:13.980
 robbery with one on an assault rifle 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:18.000
 and we find a 9 mm with the famous 5 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:20.699
 2 of michael i think like that often 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.560
 it's often him who wears it at 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:23.850
 level of this bag there so that's about 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.800
 all information is in any case 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.199
 all the images he leaked on this 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.699
 about it on accessories and I 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:31.590
 found that very interesting knowing that 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:33.780
 maybe this dlc will happen tomorrow 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.820
 and that's how you pretty much 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.800
 little ideas would I have 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.919
 talked about some things like the map 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:44.280
 identity a little bit finally the most map 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:46.770
 which allow you to spend a little 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:50.100
 all levels and then also of this 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.210
 famous infrared glasses here thank you 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.040
 for all people thanks for putting a little 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.270
 Malev jet of this is super fun 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.470
 rate of me on my personal page 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.970
 mars photo then I tell you the 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.970
 next jo and saoud
