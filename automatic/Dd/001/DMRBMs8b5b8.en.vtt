00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:04.120
 so 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.710
 or about 10 liters I'm each subject and 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:24.470
 Now I'm going to show you how to take photos 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:27.720
 Panoramic with an ipod ipad or iphone 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:31.350
 logically the iphone 5 iphone 4s ipad 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.120
 3 and ipod touch fifth generation and already what 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.760
 can do and do not need this 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.920
 tool to do this I do 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.989
 for all other devices that do not 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.059
 be the previous ones and good for 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.210
 download it we'll have to go see this 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.180
 when looking for this application here 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:50.909
 called photos and this application about 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.280
 is for iphone so if they have a 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:56.400
 iPad looks a bit blurry since it's 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.840
 designed for a smaller screen and 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:02.380
 Well, we're going to open it 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:05.410
 and once here you know this is for 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:07.450
 start making the panoramic photo and 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.060
 well let's put it on the ipad and we're going to 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.070
 start making the panoramic photo 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.120
 now close the video and then I will teach 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.640
 how it has been 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.430
 Well the photo is already done this is 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.440
 the panorama photo 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.330
 very well did not follow us either since 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.610
 I'm in a small space is not very 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.190
 big 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:30.730
 it's already very, very close but 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:33.100
 good this image has been sent 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:35.650
 automatically in our folder 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.690
 photos and we can see it now if we go 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.540
 there 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.430
 we enter 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.320
 and well there are some of the 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.690
 images that have not come out and in the end 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.670
 have come out of this and well here is 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.490
 all the previous ones that I have done wrong 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.070
 they were also and well now like 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.159
 You can see here is the picture you can enlarge 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.840
 see a little there 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.149
 and the quality of the camera depends 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.450
 will expand more or less and what we 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:07.229
 they leave and good as you can see is a 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.599
 little weird is in wavy below and 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.819
 above a little then for 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.940
 fix this that this does not happen to us with 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:19.290
 the photos of iphone 5 and all this 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:23.609
 we have to click on the image 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.739
 edit and here below cut out we cut 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:27.230
 and now we select this where 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.300
 we want 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.840
 for example here is where they finish 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:36.290
 the top part the undulations and 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.290
 more or less 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:43.130
 we can do a little more reduced by 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:45.410
 here until here that is where we want and 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.160
 same if we want to open a little towards 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.550
 above 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.170
 and so far we click on cut 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:56.730
 As you can see, it has been a little better 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:59.030
 here has been left a bit with 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.670
 an edge that we can cut even more 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:05.550
 so there is no longer the edge to remember 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.640
 we keep not especially the photo as 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.560
 we can do the same thing 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.320
 with others I have one from far away that 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:16.680
 looks pretty good and now I 'm going to 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:19.740
 cut out and so you can see how is a 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.680
 from far and cut well done well is 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:25.560
 this photo and it looks a lot better than 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:29.220
 previous since this distance also 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:33.850
 you can expand a little bit and good and to 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:37.420
 cut it out the same edit cut out 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:39.470
 we closed a bit here a little bit 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.900
 here 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:46.670
 This way too 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:50.500
 a little more and already we cut 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:53.180
 we save it and as you can see it 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:57.170
 remember very well is a panoramic photo 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:04:00.920
 normal already look like the iphone 5 and 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:04.760
 all this and well well the photos are made 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:07.879
 Panoramic the application is called photos 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.040
 without it exists here and it's good enough 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:12.430
 good since it allows us to do some 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.799
 good panoramic photos 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.560
 well this is all I hope you like it 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:19.690
 that served this video they liked 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:23.200
 the video with the little hand up 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:27.220
