is<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.010> pc<00:00:39.320> so<00:00:40.550> pin<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:42.090> crunch<00:00:42.420> pad<00:00:42.690> is<00:00:43.050> a

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
is a pc so pin the crunch pad is a

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.930 
is a pc so pin the crunch pad is a
tablet<00:00:44.280> it's<00:00:44.610> basically<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.149> tablet<00:00:45.660> pc<00:00:46.079> and

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:46.940 
tablet it's basically a tablet pc and

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.340 
tablet it's basically a tablet pc and
this<00:00:47.940> was<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.450> brainchild<00:00:48.719> of<00:00:48.899> michael

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
this was the brainchild of michael

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.410 
this was the brainchild of michael
arrington<00:00:49.649> of<00:00:49.890> TechCrunch<00:00:50.370> i'm<00:00:51.059> not<00:00:51.239> going<00:00:51.360> to

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
arrington of TechCrunch i'm not going to

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.970 
arrington of TechCrunch i'm not going to
get<00:00:51.510> into<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.750> details<00:00:52.170> about<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.829> because

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
get into the details about it because

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.619 
get into the details about it because
it's<00:00:53.309> all<00:00:53.550> pretty<00:00:54.059> much<00:00:54.239> up<00:00:54.390> in<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.539> air

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
it's all pretty much up in the air

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.660 
it's all pretty much up in the air
speculation<00:00:55.350> right<00:00:55.530> now<00:00:55.559> but<00:00:56.280> if<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:56.460> look<00:00:56.550> at

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
speculation right now but if you look at

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.130 
speculation right now but if you look at
the<00:00:56.699> pictures<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.420> prototypes<00:00:57.899> it's

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
the pictures of the prototypes it's

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.110 
the pictures of the prototypes it's
basically<00:00:58.500> a<00:01:00.140> tablet<00:01:01.140> pc<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.829> it<00:01:02.489> seems<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.879> be

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
basically a tablet pc and it seems to be

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.690 
basically a tablet pc and it seems to be
centered<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:04.110> dedicated<00:01:04.769> around<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.400> web

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
centered and dedicated around a web

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.190 
centered and dedicated around a web

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
tablet pc that's kind of what I'm

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.990 
tablet pc that's kind of what I'm
visualizing<00:01:26.659> for<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.750> crunch<00:01:28.020> pad<00:01:28.290> um<00:01:29.000> it's

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
visualizing for the crunch pad um it's

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.100 
visualizing for the crunch pad um it's
from<00:01:30.810> what<00:01:30.930> I<00:01:30.960> recall<00:01:31.200> it's<00:01:31.680> going<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.070> be<00:01:32.250> a

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
from what I recall it's going to be a

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.840 
from what I recall it's going to be a
day<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:35.100> remember<00:01:35.909> reading<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.390> was<00:01:36.540> a

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
day I I remember reading that it was a

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.100 
day I I remember reading that it was a
flavor<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:39.060> linux<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.630> they<00:01:39.720> were<00:01:39.810> running<00:01:40.079> a

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
flavor of linux that they were running a

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.630 
flavor of linux that they were running a
custom<00:01:40.350> flavor<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:40.920> linux<00:01:41.040> but<00:01:41.460> i'm<00:01:41.520> not

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
custom flavor of linux but i'm not

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.770 
custom flavor of linux but i'm not
completely<00:01:41.970> sure<00:01:42.180> i<00:01:42.329> don't<00:01:42.479> know<00:01:42.570> if<00:01:42.659> it's

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
completely sure i don't know if it's

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.880 
completely sure i don't know if it's
going<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:42.930> be<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.049> scaled-down<00:01:43.409> version<00:01:43.829> of

crunch<00:01:48.149> pad<00:01:48.390> we<00:01:48.630> don't<00:01:48.780> know<00:01:48.869> when<00:01:49.049> it's

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
crunch pad we don't know when it's

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.200 
crunch pad we don't know when it's
coming<00:01:49.229> out<00:01:49.619> for<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.100> while<00:01:50.250> we<00:01:50.460> know<00:01:50.700> if<00:01:50.909> it<00:01:51.090> was
