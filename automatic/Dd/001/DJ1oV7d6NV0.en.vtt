using<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.929> speedrun<00:00:31.439> technique<00:00:31.830> to<00:00:32.040> kill<00:00:32.219> this

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399

using a speedrun technique to kill this
boss<00:00:32.610> who's<00:00:33.120> coming<00:00:33.450> up<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.980> the<00:00:34.980> technique

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
boss who's coming up and the technique

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.569 
boss who's coming up and the technique
itself<00:00:35.870> looks<00:00:36.870> really<00:00:37.290> simple<00:00:37.710> but<00:00:38.430> the

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
itself looks really simple but the

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.250 
itself looks really simple but the
problem<00:00:39.030> with<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.719> problem<00:00:40.050> with<00:00:40.170> a<00:00:40.200> lot

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
problem with it and a problem with a lot

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.049 
problem with it and a problem with a lot
of<00:00:40.440> speedrun<00:00:40.890> techniques<00:00:41.250> is<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.700> people

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
of speedrun techniques is the people

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.479 
of speedrun techniques is the people
doing<00:00:42.329> them<00:00:42.629> are<00:00:43.110> so<00:00:43.410> good<00:00:43.739> at<00:00:43.860> them<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.399> they

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
doing them are so good at them that they

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.160 
doing them are so good at them that they
never<00:00:44.730> get<00:00:45.000> them<00:00:45.180> wrong<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.600> they<00:00:45.809> do<00:00:45.870> them

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
never get them wrong and they do them

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.510 
never get them wrong and they do them
perfectly<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.860> they<00:00:46.950> know<00:00:47.100> all<00:00:47.309> the

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
perfectly and they know all the

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.160 
perfectly and they know all the
subtleties<00:00:47.879> and<00:00:48.270> all<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.510> nuance<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:49.050> the

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
subtleties and all the nuance of the

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.040 
subtleties and all the nuance of the
strategy<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:49.860> when<00:00:50.550> you<00:00:50.670> search<00:00:50.910> for<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.360> you

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
strategy and when you search for it you

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.319 
strategy and when you search for it you
can't<00:00:52.289> find<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:53.039> subtlety<00:00:53.430> or<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.940> new<00:00:54.090> ones

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
can't find the subtlety or the new ones

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.410 
can't find the subtlety or the new ones
and<00:00:55.110> because<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:55.920> know<00:00:56.039> i<00:00:56.070> just<00:00:56.340> wanted<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.699> to

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
and because you know i just wanted to to

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.290 
and because you know i just wanted to to
record<00:00:57.780> this<00:00:57.930> quite<00:00:58.170> quickly<00:00:58.440> before<00:00:59.300> dark

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
record this quite quickly before dark

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.260 
record this quite quickly before dark

souls 2 and lightning returns I didn't

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.579 
souls 2 and lightning returns I didn't
really<00:01:03.359> have<00:01:03.539> time<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.840> do<00:01:04.110> all<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.320> much

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
really have time to do all that much

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.950 
really have time to do all that much
research<00:01:05.010> i'll<00:01:05.309> watch<00:01:05.850> streams<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.570> ask<00:01:06.720> the

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
research i'll watch streams and ask the

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.350 
research i'll watch streams and ask the
streamers<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.470> stuff<00:01:07.830> so<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.369> kind<00:01:09.299> of

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
streamers and stuff so I kind of

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.580 
streamers and stuff so I kind of
struggled<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.930> get<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.200> strategy<00:01:10.680> or<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.250> I

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
struggled to get the strategy or I and I

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.100 
struggled to get the strategy or I and I
couldn't<00:01:13.590> get<00:01:13.860> it<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.159> work<00:01:14.189> because<00:01:14.610> I<00:01:14.970> was<00:01:15.930> i

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
couldn't get it to work because I was i

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.929 
couldn't get it to work because I was i
only<00:01:16.320> had<00:01:16.439> two<00:01:16.650> out<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:16.979> three<00:01:17.340> stun<00:01:17.610> grenades

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
only had two out of three stun grenades

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.960 
only had two out of three stun grenades
and<00:01:18.240> even<00:01:18.840> then<00:01:19.020> hitting<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.830> boss<00:01:20.549> with<00:01:20.880> the

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
and even then hitting the boss with the

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.520 
and even then hitting the boss with the
stone<00:01:21.180> red<00:01:21.360> granite<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.869> make<00:01:22.049> him<00:01:22.229> flinch

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
stone red granite to make him flinch

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.950 
stone red granite to make him flinch
before<00:01:22.920> he<00:01:23.130> throws<00:01:23.369> a<00:01:23.430> stun<00:01:23.729> grenade<00:01:24.030> seem<00:01:24.810> to

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
before he throws a stun grenade seem to

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.630 
before he throws a stun grenade seem to
be<00:01:25.049> completely<00:01:25.470> random<00:01:26.009> for<00:01:26.250> me<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.580> I<00:01:26.610> know

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
be completely random for me and I know

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.340 
be completely random for me and I know
that<00:01:26.970> it's<00:01:27.090> not<00:01:27.150> because<00:01:27.570> I<00:01:27.600> saw<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.869> guy<00:01:28.110> do<00:01:28.170> it

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
that it's not because I saw a guy do it

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.920 
that it's not because I saw a guy do it
perfectly<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:29.130> it<00:01:29.490> looked<00:01:29.640> amazing<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.270> it's

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
perfectly and it looked amazing and it's

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.200 
perfectly and it looked amazing and it's
probably<00:01:31.140> just<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.920> know<00:01:32.040> my<00:01:32.520> inability<00:01:33.180> to

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
probably just you know my inability to

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.929 
probably just you know my inability to
do<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:33.869> trick<00:01:34.229> but<00:01:35.009> what<00:01:35.310> I'll<00:01:35.430> do<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:35.820> I'll

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
do that trick but what I'll do is I'll

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.230 
do that trick but what I'll do is I'll
explain<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.450> trick<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:38.060> you'll<00:01:39.060> get

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
explain the trick to you and you'll get

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.999 
explain the trick to you and you'll get
to<00:01:39.329> practice<00:01:39.659> yourself<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.380> it's<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.740> really

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
to practice yourself and it's a really

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.830 
to practice yourself and it's a really
effective<00:01:41.369> move<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.060> it<00:01:42.150> looks<00:01:42.390> fantastic

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
effective move and it looks fantastic

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.109 
effective move and it looks fantastic
when<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.259> get<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.500> right<00:01:43.680> it's<00:01:44.009> just<00:01:44.970> the

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
when you get it right it's just the

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.240 
when you get it right it's just the
amount<00:01:45.329> of<00:01:45.509> times<00:01:45.720> where<00:01:45.990> he<00:01:46.259> had<00:01:46.470> life<00:01:46.920> left

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
amount of times where he had life left

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.620 
amount of times where he had life left
because<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:47.670> didn't<00:01:47.909> have<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.149> third<00:01:48.329> stun

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
because I didn't have the third stun

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.990 
because I didn't have the third stun
grenade<00:01:48.960> made<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.530> so<00:01:49.710> that<00:01:49.880> after<00:01:50.880> that

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
grenade made it so that after that

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.359 
grenade made it so that after that
initial<00:01:51.270> beginning<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.649> was<00:01:52.920> completely

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
initial beginning it was completely

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.980 
initial beginning it was completely
random<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:53.939> bullshit<00:01:54.299> afterwards<00:01:54.750> because

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
random and bullshit afterwards because

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.600 
random and bullshit afterwards because
he<00:01:55.140> will<00:01:55.290> run<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.710> random<00:01:55.950> spot<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:56.490> would

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
he will run to a random spot I would

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.370 
he will run to a random spot I would
find<00:01:56.880> him<00:01:57.030> again<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.780> try<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.079> get<00:01:58.259> the

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
find him again and I try and get the

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.749 
find him again and I try and get the
trick<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:58.890> had<00:01:58.979> just<00:01:59.130> not<00:01:59.340> go<00:01:59.490> well<00:01:59.700> I

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
trick and it had just not go well I

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.090 
trick and it had just not go well I
didn't<00:02:00.149> take<00:02:00.240> too<00:02:00.479> much<00:02:00.630> time<00:02:00.960> so<00:02:01.649> i<00:02:01.680> ended<00:02:02.009> up

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
didn't take too much time so i ended up

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.190 
didn't take too much time so i ended up
restarting<00:02:02.759> until<00:02:02.850> i<00:02:03.030> got<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.210> decent<00:02:03.810> enough

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200

fire<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.460> the<00:02:08.610> checkpoints<00:02:09.229> this<00:02:10.229> game<00:02:10.470> if<00:02:10.679> you

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
fire is the checkpoints this game if you

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.530 
fire is the checkpoints this game if you
don't<00:02:10.800> know<00:02:11.190> check<00:02:11.460> points<00:02:11.760> between<00:02:11.940> loading

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.210 
don't know check points between loading
screens<00:02:12.900> so<00:02:13.140> when<00:02:13.380> you<00:02:13.470> move<00:02:13.680> between<00:02:13.830> areas

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
screens so when you move between areas

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.270 
screens so when you move between areas
it<00:02:14.610> saves<00:02:15.000> so<00:02:15.360> if<00:02:16.050> you<00:02:16.200> were<00:02:16.350> to<00:02:16.410> retry<00:02:16.950> when

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
it saves so if you were to retry when

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.210 
it saves so if you were to retry when
you<00:02:17.370> die<00:02:17.840> you<00:02:18.840> would<00:02:18.990> retry<00:02:19.470> in<00:02:19.710> between<00:02:20.070> the

you die you would retry in between the

you die you would retry in between the

areas in the middle of those fights and
it's<00:02:22.170> not<00:02:22.710> really<00:02:22.860> what<00:02:23.100> you<00:02:23.280> want<00:02:23.460> to<00:02:23.520> do<00:02:23.670> you

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
it's not really what you want to do you

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.780 
it's not really what you want to do you
want<00:02:24.090> to<00:02:24.180> take<00:02:24.330> him<00:02:24.480> from<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:24.810> beginning<00:02:24.930> and

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
to kill you and you can restart and you

to kill you and you can restart and you

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
can improve it and it's nice and quick

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.270 
can improve it and it's nice and quick
well<00:02:35.760> if<00:02:36.150> you<00:02:36.600> let<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.959> end<00:02:37.110> kill<00:02:37.530> you<00:02:37.709> you

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
well if you let the end kill you you

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.550 
well if you let the end kill you you
don't<00:02:38.520> die<00:02:38.820> he<00:02:39.330> trunks<00:02:39.750> you<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:40.080> you<00:02:40.170> ended<00:02:40.440> up

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
don't die he trunks you and you ended up

don't die he trunks you and you ended up

probably the trickiest boss fight to
restart<00:02:47.070> on<00:02:47.340> just<00:02:47.970> because<00:02:48.239> you<00:02:48.360> have<00:02:48.480> to<00:02:48.630> quit

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.120 
sniping him with the SVD but because
this<00:03:30.840> was<00:03:30.989> going<00:03:31.110> to<00:03:31.170> be<00:03:31.230> a<00:03:31.320> non-lethal<00:03:31.799> player

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
this was going to be a non-lethal player

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.100 
this was going to be a non-lethal player
through<00:03:32.370> my<00:03:32.880> strategy<00:03:33.450> for<00:03:33.480> fighting<00:03:33.930> him

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
through my strategy for fighting him

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.810 
through my strategy for fighting him
doesn't<00:03:34.620> exist<00:03:34.980> cuz<00:03:35.190> you<00:03:35.280> have<00:03:35.430> to<00:03:35.519> do<00:03:35.610> it<00:03:35.730> with

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
doesn't exist cuz you have to do it with

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.220 
doesn't exist cuz you have to do it with
the<00:03:35.910> pistol<00:03:36.030> she<00:03:36.390> don't<00:03:36.540> have<00:03:36.690> the<00:03:36.870> mosin

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
the pistol she don't have the mosin

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.970 
the pistol she don't have the mosin
nagant<00:03:37.700> so<00:03:38.700> i<00:03:38.730> went<00:03:39.000> from<00:03:39.180> the<00:03:39.840> end<00:03:40.019> being<00:03:40.830> the

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
nagant so i went from the end being the

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.590 
nagant so i went from the end being the

the box but you don't have to it's

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.970 
the box but you don't have to it's
entirely<00:04:12.390> up<00:04:12.570> to<00:04:12.750> you<00:04:12.870> so<00:04:13.530> sneaking<00:04:13.739> through

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
this area I go on the left hand side and

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.900 
this area I go on the left hand side and
I'm<00:04:16.739> gonna<00:04:16.890> beat<00:04:17.039> ranking<00:04:17.400> a<00:04:17.459> few<00:04:17.609> people

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
I'm gonna beat ranking a few people

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:18.390 
I'm gonna beat ranking a few people
because

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
because

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.939 
because
the<00:04:19.090> path<00:04:19.299> but<00:04:19.449> I<00:04:19.540> was<00:04:19.690> doing<00:04:19.959> on<00:04:20.109> this<00:04:20.259> worked

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:20.949 
the path but I was doing on this worked

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:22.469 
the path but I was doing on this worked
every<00:04:21.400> so<00:04:21.549> often<00:04:21.729> but<00:04:22.000> then<00:04:22.120> one<00:04:22.300> or<00:04:22.389> two

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479 
every so often but then one or two

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:24.090 
every so often but then one or two
guards<00:04:22.840> would<00:04:22.930> catch<00:04:23.169> me<00:04:23.199> out<00:04:23.530> and<00:04:23.800> after<00:04:23.949> a

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
guards would catch me out and after a

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.890 
guards would catch me out and after a
while<00:04:24.340> it<00:04:24.669> got<00:04:24.759> a<00:04:24.820> little<00:04:25.000> bit<00:04:25.150> frustrating<00:04:25.750> so

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
while it got a little bit frustrating so

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.570 
while it got a little bit frustrating so
I<00:04:25.930> just<00:04:26.080> decided<00:04:26.199> to<00:04:26.590> shoot<00:04:26.770> them<00:04:27.009> for

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
I just decided to shoot them for

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.279 
I just decided to shoot them for
instance<00:04:27.850> this<00:04:28.270> guy<00:04:28.509> here<00:04:28.780> if<00:04:28.930> you<00:04:29.139> move

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:29.289 
instance this guy here if you move

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:31.200 
instance this guy here if you move
forward<00:04:29.770> a<00:04:29.889> bunch<00:04:30.070> of<00:04:30.190> birds<00:04:30.370> or<00:04:30.639> scuffle<00:04:31.060> and

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
forward a bunch of birds or scuffle and

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.010 
forward a bunch of birds or scuffle and
it<00:04:31.960> alerted<00:04:32.380> him<00:04:32.620> every<00:04:33.009> single<00:04:33.340> time<00:04:33.580> and

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
it alerted him every single time and

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.469 
it alerted him every single time and
then<00:04:35.020> sometimes<00:04:35.380> it<00:04:35.530> wouldn't<00:04:35.800> do<00:04:35.889> it<00:04:35.919> it<00:04:36.220> were

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 
then sometimes it wouldn't do it it were

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:40.290 
then sometimes it wouldn't do it it were
really<00:04:37.479> strange<00:04:37.810> and<00:04:38.970> didn't<00:04:39.970> make<00:04:40.060> too<00:04:40.090> much

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
really strange and didn't make too much

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.499 
really strange and didn't make too much
sense<00:04:40.360> for<00:04:41.759> there's<00:04:42.759> there's<00:04:43.030> quite<00:04:43.180> a<00:04:43.210> lot<00:04:43.360> of

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:43.509 
sense for there's there's quite a lot of

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:45.330 
sense for there's there's quite a lot of
dudes<00:04:43.660> here<00:04:43.960> so<00:04:44.560> you<00:04:44.620> need<00:04:44.800> to<00:04:44.830> be<00:04:44.919> careful<00:04:45.130> i

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
dudes here so you need to be careful i

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.439 
dudes here so you need to be careful i
think<00:04:45.520> there's<00:04:45.639> about<00:04:45.669> three<00:04:46.090> of<00:04:46.210> them<00:04:46.330> in

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:46.449 
think there's about three of them in

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:47.969 
think there's about three of them in
this<00:04:46.570> room<00:04:46.780> i<00:04:46.900> can<00:04:47.050> see<00:04:47.199> the<00:04:47.320> first<00:04:47.530> one<00:04:47.620> there

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979 
this room i can see the first one there

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:50.490 
this room i can see the first one there
so<00:04:48.699> i'm<00:04:48.940> gonna<00:04:49.090> quickly<00:04:49.270> track<00:04:49.630> him<00:04:49.900> and<00:04:50.110> as<00:04:50.380> I

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
so i'm gonna quickly track him and as I

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.029 
so i'm gonna quickly track him and as I
move<00:04:50.650> forward<00:04:50.680> I'm<00:04:51.160> gonna<00:04:51.310> see<00:04:51.460> the<00:04:51.610> next<00:04:51.789> one

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:53.039 
move forward I'm gonna see the next one

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:55.950 
move forward I'm gonna see the next one
he<00:04:54.039> is<00:04:54.250> studied<00:04:54.850> there<00:04:55.060> do<00:04:55.240> you<00:04:55.300> see<00:04:55.449> him<00:04:55.539> so

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
he is studied there do you see him so

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.890 
he is studied there do you see him so
I'm<00:04:56.020> gonna<00:04:56.139> track<00:04:56.410> him<00:04:57.449> just<00:04:58.449> as<00:04:58.600> he<00:04:58.690> saw<00:04:58.840> me

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
I'm gonna track him just as he saw me

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.680 
I'm gonna track him just as he saw me
and<00:04:59.169> I<00:04:59.470> think<00:04:59.740> there's<00:04:59.949> this<00:05:00.760> might<00:05:01.270> be<00:05:01.449> one

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
and I think there's this might be one

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:06.210 
and I think there's this might be one
more<00:05:03.900> you'll<00:05:04.900> notice<00:05:05.260> I'm<00:05:05.410> I'm<00:05:05.710> always<00:05:05.949> doing

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
more you'll notice I'm I'm always doing
