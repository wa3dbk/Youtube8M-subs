00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.500
 welcome back and I would like to 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.759
 today with a specific exercise 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.450
 deal and that is about the 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.910
 Covers and the question are covers for 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.580
 the back or the breast 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.670
 respectively and ask a bit 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.680
 To specialize in the exercise belongs in 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.230
 the back program or in the chest 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.929
 By the way, program about trains are the 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.669
 Exercising with the dumbbells makes you where to 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.550
 lay down on the flat band and then 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.630
 quasi with hands according to the head 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.610
 pulls behind and after show 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.530
 Plating is then I already have 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.360
 says and it was already me 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.250
 always aware where to live but hears 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.539
 Strangely enough, it's mine now and then 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.670
 studio and I have the feeling that 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.559
 on some youtube channel on one 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.820
 video has ever seen that 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.199
 Some of them are a bit like that though 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.270
 Do not do it wrong, just do it 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.770
 to use for what they do not actually 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.289
 is thought and that will be at 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.120
 others make the wrong impression 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.920
 I will was also from time to time have 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.930
 I wrote to trains and there 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.320
 I sat here thinking and so on 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.260
 but very short as the name already 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.479
 About pledged it is a train movement 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.170
 and train movements come only from the 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.390
 move 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.460
 you can not move from the train 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.799
 chest or triceps for example 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.970
 make first as pressure movements so 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.040
 Of course it is one too 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.530
 Exercise fill back and not for the 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.750
 chest 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.299
 point out so of course some now 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:35.060
 say yes but yes I must in the 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:37.619
 wholesale markets something to understand 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.210
 First, the shifts train under 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.280
 other very well here before the 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.290
 so-called senators an terrors is like that 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.229
 called sailing muscle he is located 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.360
 here next to the breast you can see above all 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.960
 very well if you count in the body 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:56.369
 fat content and secondly in the 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.950
 Endposition therefore keeps on the head experienced 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.229
 the chest muscle has a maximum elongation 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.570
 a very good stretch and that leads 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.820
 to that some the next day too 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.829
 the bus traces in form, for example, as a muscle hangover 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.770
 that does not mean that's great 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:13.150
 The breast has been trained naturally 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.799
 the breast works as an example 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:19.150
 muscle somehow with yes and of course 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:21.040
 you also train or work 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.560
 the triceps with at the front ten 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.060
 years when too much for the poor as 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.000
 For a long time the short trade moved January 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.370
 a movement a pole women's movement 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.900
 and then you learn a bit 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.909
 already in the jersey of playing maybe 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.819
 not on the triceps but the question is 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:38.680
 always what is training primarily where he is 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:40.569
 The premiums will follow the premiere 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.159
 training effect of the training stimulus and 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.040
 definitely that is definitely in 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:47.500
 back and not in the chest or otherwise 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.940
 somewhere it is of course there 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.370
 any other faxes still with it 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.040
 while you 're done with that and 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.950
 then there you can but i mean im 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.510
 end effect of bank printing works too 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.099
 the back somehow as a tool 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.599
 stabilize with but I do not do any 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.650
 Bench press when I step back but kick 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:04.239
 I 'll make you bench press 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.629
 back training and doing accordingly 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.950
 also not covers for the borussia was 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:11.349
 I basically only use it 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.760
 train the back yes and the couple 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:16.000
 percent where then maybe the breast 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.620
 somehow working together is not enough 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.060
 to put a training room and if 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.530
 I'm for a specific program 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.150
 exercises introductory 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.459
 then they lead up For a course to 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.590
 a because of course a primary one 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.030
 Muscle is mainly irritated 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.980
 and not because as auxiliary muscles 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:36.489
 cooperating as easy as that is 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:39.129
 The breasts also work during squats 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:41.190
 yes, we have her 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:43.989
 I know what my nose covers 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.739
 definitely for the back and nothing 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.919
 other 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:51.750
 and build them there too and that's it 

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:51.750
 thank you also not from me
