00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.800
 Some time ago I did not do an episode of Hidden Jewels, so I think it has arrived 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.910
 the moment. Today it's the turn of an excellent game known as The Ninja Warriors, for 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.719
 the Super Nintendo. Let's see what this is about. 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:22.900
 The game was developed by Natsume, the same company that created the great Wild Guns, 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:29.089
 and published by Taito in the year 1994. It is actually a Remake of the Ninja game 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:34.730
 Warriors that left in 1987 for recreational. 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.579
 It's one of the best beat em up's I've played, and unlike most games 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.149
 of this style, the action occurs in a single plane, where you can move from left to 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:47.430
 right or vice versa, unlike games like final fight where you can move too 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.559
 from up to down. But before going into more detail regarding the gameplay, let's see 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:52.920
 the story that he offers us. 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.440
 The game starts very well, with an epic introduction, accompanied by a song 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.219
 excellent, and places us in a dystopian future where the population is oppressed 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.130
 by Banglar, a drunken tyrant of power. The only salvation for this society in 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.830
 ruins is a resistance, which with much effort has developed 03 androids to eliminate 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.920
 once and for all to the evil dictator. However, from one moment to another Banglar 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.210
 he discovered the plans of the rebels and launched a surprise attack on them, who did not 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:27.030
 They had another option rather than deploying the robots without testing them before. 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:37.070
 You are presented with the possibility of choosing 03 characters, each with different abilities. 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.439
 Ninja is the biggest and strongest of all, which makes it the slowest too. For 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:46.630
 jump uses a propeller that has placed in the back, also, when approaching the 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.719
 enemies will load them automatically and you can throw them against others, even if it's a robot 

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:55.899
 of several tons! It has one of the best attacks of the game, in which it jumps to then 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:01.009
 fall on the enemies, hitting them several times. Even though I usually prefer 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.880
 to the agile characters, in this game Ninja is my favorite character, with whom I feel 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.610
 with the power to destroy whoever gets in front of me. 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.080
 Kunoichi is the most balanced character, with good speed and good attack, armed 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:20.130
 with a pair of kunais and a katana that he uses at the end of his combos. Finally we find 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.720
 to Kamaitachi, the fastest of the 03, with great mobility and armed with a couple of 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.510
 sharp blades. Each character is a unique experience already 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.100
 that all present different movements, combinations and special attacks, and it's very 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:40.330
 Satisfying to discover them all and find which one suits your style of play better. 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.080
 All three have the ability to cover themselves and use a special attack once they charge 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:49.080
 a power bar, but be careful! If they hit you and you fall to the ground while this bar is 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.130
 loading, you will lose it and you will have to start over. Something that caught my attention 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.470
 is that you can advance and attack crouching, which opens a range of possibilities and strategies 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:06.560
 what can you use? 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.940
 Video games are made to entertain us, and this is achieved by far. It's too fun 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.950
 use the different attacks and combinations that you have at your disposal to finish with 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.480
 the waves of enemies that seek to destroy you. You will never feel limited because of 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.040
 the controls or the movements of your character, and I assure you that you will never get bored 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.260
 since the action does not stop arriving. It also helps that there is a wide variety of adversaries 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.710
 with which we will have to face, we will find the typical soldiers who die in one blow, 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:40.730
 a big guy who holds a lot of damage, a gangster very similar to Ken Street 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.440
 Fighter, who learned the best trick of Dhalsim throwing fire by the mouth, to very elegant ones 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.980
 fighters, robots that throw lasers by the eyes and even the dwarf children 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.790
 Cheetah himself. 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.970
 You will have to use different strategies to defeat these enemies, since they do not 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.430
 always approaching and attacking will work. For example robots can not attack them 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.120
 in front, since your armor protects them, so you'll have to hit them from behind, 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.450
 or else grab them and smash them against the ground or other enemies. 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.190
 Another aspect of the game that I found incredible is the fact that you will not only have to face 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:20.040
 with the enemies, if not that the same scenarios will put you in trouble. For example, there is a 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.530
 level at which you will have to dodge missiles that fall from the sky while you fight 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.250
 against the waves of enemies, in another a helicopter will appear in the background that will start 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.850
 shoot, and there's one in which industrial fans wait for your chance to take you 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.190
 a piece of metal. Of course, the game is not unfair, since 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:42.050
 That hurt our character will also do the same with enemies. It is fun 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.430
 get between 2 fans and see how the poor opponents are disemboweled. 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:56.410
 Even if some enemy charges you and throws you against others, it will also hurt them. 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:00.260
 I do not want to talk in detail about the bosses so as not to ruin the experience, the only thing 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:04.850
 I will say is that they all have fun designs and they are quite different from each other, needing 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:11.040
 all kinds of strategies to be defeated. I'll just mention the first of them, an android 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.670
 quite large that seems to have some kind of kinship with the android number 16 of 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:17.840
 Dragon Ball. 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.740
 As you may have already noticed, the graphics and music are masterful, something to which 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:28.810
 Natsume has already accustomed us. The detail of the levels is very worked, and there 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:33.760
 a lot of variety in the 08 you'll go, from a parking lot, through a center 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.050
 commercial abandoned until a field full of snow and many others. 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:42.700
 A somewhat curious fact is that the versions of the game in the US and Europe were censored. 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:47.280
 He replaced some enemy ninjas by the little cheetahs ... thinking that one of the 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.020
 most annoying enemies of the game might not appear ... Also the green blood that appears when 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.870
 you attack with Kunoichi or Kamaitachi in the Japanese version. 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:59.990
 It is difficult to find negative aspects to this jewel, but I have heard from many sources 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.960
 that it takes away some points from the fact that it's only for one player. I think differently, 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.280
 if outside of 02 I think it would not work, since both characters could get in the way 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:14.430
 Yes, there is little room to maneuver. Something I could mention is that the game 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:18.900
 It is a bit short, with only 08 levels, but it helps a lot that there are 02 difficulties 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.960
 and 03 very different characters from each other. 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:29.200
 This game has it all: Ninjas, robots, excellent graphics, sublime music, different 

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:35.440
 characters, good level of difficulty, and most importantly: fun piles. 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.690
 Of course, it's going to be a bit difficult to get, since it has not been published in the console 

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:45.300
 Virtual Wii or Wii U, and its market price is high. However, if you have 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.980
 opportunity to play it, do not hesitate to do it, it is a masterpiece that deserves to be enjoyed, 

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:55.800
 you're going to have a great time with this gem. 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.970
 That has been all for today, I hope you liked the video. Please do not forget 

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:02.820
 to support me by subscribing to the channel and watching my other videos, I will continue working to 

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:08.310
 always bring good content. Thank you very much for the support. Pepe the magician says goodbye, 

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:09.080
 until next time!
