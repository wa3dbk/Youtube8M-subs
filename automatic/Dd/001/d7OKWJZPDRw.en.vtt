to<00:01:01.430> go<00:01:01.730> hear<00:01:02.150> it<00:01:02.630> on<00:01:02.810> I<00:01:03.110> didn't<00:01:03.829> put<00:01:04.040> it<00:01:04.220> all<00:01:04.460> the

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
to go hear it on I didn't put it all the

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.999 
to go hear it on I didn't put it all the
way<00:01:04.729> off<00:01:05.000> because<00:01:05.270> I<00:01:05.660> like<00:01:05.930> this<00:01:06.259> dirty<00:01:06.680> water

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:07.009

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
think it seems like when you look at

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.540 
think it seems like when you look at
Akron<00:01:09.860> Aquadome<00:01:10.340> color<00:01:10.700> and<00:01:11.060> it<00:01:11.450> has<00:01:11.690> light<00:01:12.550> in

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
Akron Aquadome color and it has light in

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.910 
Akron Aquadome color and it has light in
the<00:01:13.910> color<00:01:14.180> it<00:01:14.660> looks<00:01:14.780> like<00:01:15.229> it's<00:01:15.410> lit<00:01:15.740> from

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
the color it looks like it's lit from

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.260 
the color it looks like it's lit from
behind<00:01:16.160> all<00:01:17.119> of<00:01:17.149> them<00:01:17.630> now<00:01:18.500> are<00:01:19.270> made

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
behind all of them now are made

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:26.200 
behind all of them now are made
synthetically<00:01:21.610> that<00:01:23.800> particle<00:01:24.800> size<00:01:25.220> so<00:01:25.970> you

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
synthetically that particle size so you

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.919 
synthetically that particle size so you
can<00:01:26.240> control<00:01:26.810> that<00:01:27.020> you<00:01:27.920> can<00:01:28.270> make<00:01:29.270> a<00:01:29.300> really

00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:29.929 
can control that you can make a really

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:33.820 
can control that you can make a really
really<00:01:30.110> nice<00:01:30.530> so<00:01:31.399> really<00:01:32.330> and<00:01:32.450> warm<00:01:33.080> it<00:01:33.200> up<00:01:33.289> for

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
really nice so really and warm it up for
