00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:23.649 
I go here to the back what's happened is

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:29.380 
I go here to the back what's happened is
when<00:01:24.649> I'm<00:01:24.740> sharpening<00:01:26.500> when<00:01:27.500> the<00:01:27.619> stones<00:01:28.390> run

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
when I'm sharpening when the stones run

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.469 
when I'm sharpening when the stones run
into<00:01:29.720> this<00:01:29.869> hump<00:01:30.280> where<00:01:31.280> the<00:01:31.430> grinds<00:01:31.729> meet<00:01:32.119> for

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
into this hump where the grinds meet for

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.070 
into this hump where the grinds meet for
the<00:01:32.540> V<00:01:32.720> edge<00:01:33.130> the<00:01:34.130> stones<00:01:34.460> lift<00:01:34.909> up<00:01:35.180> and<00:01:35.450> I

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
the V edge the stones lift up and I

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.149 
the V edge the stones lift up and I
don't<00:01:36.140> know<00:01:36.350> if<00:01:36.439> you'll<00:01:36.560> make<00:01:36.740> it<00:01:36.890> out<00:01:36.979> but

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
don't know if you'll make it out but

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:39.219 
don't know if you'll make it out but
there's<00:01:37.340> a<00:01:37.400> low<00:01:37.640> spot<00:01:37.970> up<00:01:38.180> here<00:01:38.210> where<00:01:39.110> the

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
there's a low spot up here where the

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:40.960 
there's a low spot up here where the
other<00:01:39.409> corner<00:01:40.009> of<00:01:40.100> the<00:01:40.189> stone<00:01:40.430> is<00:01:40.670> hitting

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
other corner of the stone is hitting

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.910 
other corner of the stone is hitting
them<00:01:41.119> hitting<00:01:41.540> the<00:01:41.659> edge<00:01:41.780> so<00:01:42.680> there's<00:01:42.860> a

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
them hitting the edge so there's a

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.289 
them hitting the edge so there's a
little<00:01:43.189> hiccup<00:01:43.520> right<00:01:43.790> there<00:01:43.970> where<00:01:44.150> the

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
little hiccup right there where the

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:46.929 
little hiccup right there where the
steel<00:01:44.600> is<00:01:44.810> lower<00:01:45.110> than<00:01:45.920> the<00:01:46.100> rest<00:01:46.280> almost<00:01:46.790> like

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
steel is lower than the rest almost like

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:48.810 
steel is lower than the rest almost like
a<00:01:46.970> little<00:01:47.180> serrations<00:01:47.630> so<00:01:47.990> I<00:01:48.020> have<00:01:48.290> a<00:01:48.320> plan

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
a little serrations so I have a plan

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.249 
a little serrations so I have a plan
could<00:01:49.820> go<00:01:50.000> terribly<00:01:50.270> wrong<00:01:50.479> thought<00:01:51.049> I<00:01:51.079> would

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259
