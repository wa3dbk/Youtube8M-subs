 Hi everyone, look at the site 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.300
 Today we will talk about massacres that Vincitorio 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.100
 a fashion that has just come out 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.119
 it is a fashion for roma 2 total 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:27.029
 war what is strange about this fashion 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:29.490
 unlocks all factions in Rome 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.980
 which honestly has me at least 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.040
 surprised somewhat as the creative 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.110
 assembly had stated that factions 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.239
 they would have been released or by dlc 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.610
 or by donation made by 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.879
 creativity always as and 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:47.820
 time passed but we immediately pass to 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.610
 see how to get and install 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.000
 this fashion then first 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.340
 we have to go to the total tovar website 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.070
 workcentre that is the official website of the 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.859

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.720
 our desktop 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:52.500
 once you have downloaded the files yes 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.240

 take it installed and it's very simple 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.940
 then he will do everything by himself then 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.940
 let's proceed with the installation go 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:17.560

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:19.410

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.730

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:27.820
 take click again with right and 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:28.570
 do spain now start computer disk 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.220
 local c 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.950
 of course if you have steam installed 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.510
 the record went somewhere else 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:40.000
 where you installed then estimates 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:42.489
 go to x86 programs scroll time 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.050
 until you find the steam folder 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:50.610
 this one back inside steam 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:55.180
 you need to search for this folder 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:57.220
 after estimate go to common here found 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.970
 all your blinds installed 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:05.230
 go to total war on 2 then in the 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.680
 folder given this here once here 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.660
 inside 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:13.870
 right click and a white dot e 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:17.049
 Paste Here is our file now 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:21.610
 close this window we go to the 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:25.360
 second file star poses how much you make of 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.830
 new extracts here makes the difference 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.239
 of that other is contained in more 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.340
 folder this because if you wanted 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:32.709
 you could extract it directly in the 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.900
 common steam folder 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.030
 indeed not in the total war 2 folder of 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.790
 estimate however this would replace you 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.410
 files that do not have inside 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.739
 never advisable always 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:47.200
 save the old original files of 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:48.930
 games anyway in case you should 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.700
 happen to lose the old file 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.829
 estimate from the possibility to restore 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.959
 the growth of the game which means i 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:58.569
 modified files would be feared 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:00.340
 replaced change a missing 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:02.290
 however we do a procedure 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.569
 surfacing enter the singer 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:07.450
 in the campaign folder you just have 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:07.889
 extracted inside you will find another in 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.549

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:13.569

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:19.870

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:24.400
 make no start computer size of 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:25.840
 drain calici programs for 86 folder 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:34.080
 steam always stays down at the bottom 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:37.750
 naturally esteem p's como total war ii 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:45.250
 at this point, enter also in 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:48.270

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:58.840
 what do you take, click on it with your right 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:05:03.840
 and let's rename we want old star 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:07.090
 I can then stick to the firewall 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.949
 close this window 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:14.080
 here we are on the total home screen 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:17.560
 war 2 the first icon we see new 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:20.860
 campaign and voila you have all the cultures 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:26.970
 unlocked and within each culture 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:26.970
 all factions spectacular 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:34.559
 unfortunately little bug as you see 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:37.830
 the icons of some factions are missing, however 

00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:37.830
 that's fine 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.219
 I don't care about anything at all 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.370
 now we can play with any 

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:44.370
 faction 

00:05:48.939 --> 00:05:53.080
