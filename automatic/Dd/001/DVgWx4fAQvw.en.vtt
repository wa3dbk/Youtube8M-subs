00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.410
 always from America and like mine 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.219
 announced a little on facebook 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.960
 unboxing a penny bought here leave 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.549
 of envy if you do n't feel well 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.050
 feel a little sorry 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.750
 anything I can do to be able to 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.859
 will show this video in preview 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.109
 we intend to kill the first who 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:31.349
 simply envy custody 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:34.730
 now I open no deal open 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.730
 also new to me 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:45.059
 well it tied with a rope then 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:46.140
 I'll disconnect very stiff shield that like 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.879
 I remind you it is not yet in 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.660
 marketing in italy are 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.350
 output in america 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:58.350
 ok nothing of that 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:01:00.979
 now let's go to the shield certainly e 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.979
 work 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:07.120
 remember all my various annoyances 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:10.750
 around then rightly which agent in 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.700
 america screams break the bales 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.260
 let's see if I can 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.550
 simultaneously on both sides 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.910
 I must say that they have packed it for 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.910
 well 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.210
 unfortunately I won't be able to do it in this 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.189
 video so you have to undergo what I'm looking for 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:34.810
 to open a package 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:36.700
 because it is so because no no that is the 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.310
 laptop wanted that I 'm not used to 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.250
 do video editing so I don't know 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:47.560
 not even looking for a program then not 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:50.649
 it works well ok it came out this is it 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.140
 that we find the box when 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.870
 information 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.150
 and the image of the signature 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.260
 these how the box looks like 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:05.140
 place of birth 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:08.450
 the trademark of envy is this 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:11.180
 is the console 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:15.010
 a little slightly dirty inside though not 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:21.319
 I know why now we're going to open 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:24.170
 ok is attacked here ok first as before 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:29.599
 feeling but maybe I expected it more 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:31.790
 instead as heavy weight is not bad and 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:34.910
 this is the city as open as you can 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.680
 see the analogue various rates and 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.470
 deserve because as you can see 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.120
 maybe you will know the rates on the various 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.500
 android phones because it is a console 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:48.049
 with android it's nothing then now 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.700
 I had it personally and 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:52.130
 probably just back in Italy 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:56.510
 so in a couple of days maybe 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:58.610
 we do around 20 I will make a video in 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.450
 which showed it when it lights up various 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:05.390
 maybe even games we will say profoundly 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.880
 a little better this console than mine 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.380
 very interesting opinion therefore a 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.980
 I greet you all and see you next 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.980
 video
