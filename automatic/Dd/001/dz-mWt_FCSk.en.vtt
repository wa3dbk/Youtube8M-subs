00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
handout where I describe each mode in

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.700 
handout where I describe each mode in
detail<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:29.099> another<00:00:29.580> one<00:00:29.820> is<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.529> handout<00:00:31.529> with

the tablature written on it for each

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.470 
the tablature written on it for each
mode<00:00:34.309> now<00:00:35.309> what<00:00:35.520> this<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.059> modes<00:00:36.270> are

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
mode now what this is the modes are

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.780 
mode now what this is the modes are
basically<00:00:36.930> scales<00:00:37.380> it's<00:00:38.160> seven<00:00:38.640> different

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
basically scales it's seven different

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.420 
basically scales it's seven different
scales<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:39.829> the<00:00:40.829> way<00:00:40.920> that<00:00:41.070> I'm<00:00:41.160> going<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.309> do

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
scales and the way that I'm going to do

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.220 
scales and the way that I'm going to do
it<00:00:41.520> with<00:00:41.610> my<00:00:41.700> right<00:00:41.910> hand<00:00:42.239> is<00:00:42.780> I'm<00:00:42.989> just<00:00:43.020> going

it with my right hand is I'm just going

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.850 
it with my right hand is I'm just going
to<00:00:43.320> alternate<00:00:43.969> thumb<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.270> index<00:00:46.110> thumb<00:00:46.590> and

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
to alternate thumb and index thumb and

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.110 
to alternate thumb and index thumb and
index<00:00:47.160> so<00:00:47.309> now<00:00:47.460> I'm<00:00:47.550> going<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.760> show<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:47.969> the

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
index so now I'm going to show you the

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.549 
index so now I'm going to show you the
right<00:00:48.329> hand<00:00:48.570> that's<00:00:49.020> why<00:00:49.140> I'm<00:00:49.289> telling<00:00:49.440> you

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
this now every time I play two notes I'm

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.520 
this now every time I play two notes I'm
going<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.420> be<00:00:54.480> alternating<00:00:54.809> those<00:00:55.140> notes<00:00:55.410> with

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
going to be alternating those notes with

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.080 
going to be alternating those notes with
my<00:00:55.649> thumb<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.250> then<00:00:57.149> index<00:00:57.949> okay<00:00:58.949> so<00:00:59.609> just

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
my thumb and then index okay so just

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.240 
my thumb and then index okay so just
like<00:01:00.239> this<00:01:00.420> is<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.660> down<00:01:00.840> pic<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.230> your<00:01:01.379> guitar

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
like this is the down pic of your guitar

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.219 
like this is the down pic of your guitar
pick<00:01:02.489> this<00:01:02.910> would<00:01:03.120> be<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.300> up<00:01:03.420> pick<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.840> index

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
pick this would be the up pick the index

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.789 
pick this would be the up pick the index
so<00:01:04.379> down<00:01:04.589> up<00:01:04.920> down<00:01:05.549> up<00:01:06.260> okay<00:01:07.260> let's<00:01:07.560> just<00:01:07.680> go

how to play them okay G Lydian it's

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.800 
how to play them okay G Lydian it's
gonna<00:01:16.619> be<00:01:16.770> one<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:16.950> our<00:01:17.070> three<00:01:17.340> major<00:01:17.610> modes<00:01:18.090> so

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
gonna be one of our three major modes so

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.270 
gonna be one of our three major modes so
we're<00:01:18.930> getting<00:01:19.049> back<00:01:19.259> into<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.619> major<00:01:19.860> sound

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
we're getting back into a major sound

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.760 
we're getting back into a major sound
okay<00:01:21.030> it's<00:01:21.180> gonna<00:01:21.299> have<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.509> same<00:01:21.810> notes<00:01:22.110> as<00:01:22.409> d

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
okay it's gonna have the same notes as d

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.600 
okay it's gonna have the same notes as d
major<00:01:23.240> which<00:01:24.240> basically<00:01:24.780> we're<00:01:24.900> gonna<00:01:24.960> have<00:01:25.610> G

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
major which basically we're gonna have G

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.390 
major which basically we're gonna have G
a<00:01:26.990> B<00:01:27.990> C<00:01:28.320> sharp<00:01:28.939> d<00:01:29.939> e<00:01:29.970> F<00:01:30.689> sharp<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:31.409> G<00:01:31.470> now<00:01:32.280> it

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
a B C sharp d e F sharp and G now it

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.700 
a B C sharp d e F sharp and G now it
gets<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:32.759> sound<00:01:33.090> by<00:01:33.329> having<00:01:33.750> taking<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.290> G<00:01:34.470> major

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
gets it sound by having taking a G major

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.679 
gets it sound by having taking a G major
scale<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.759> you're<00:01:35.880> basically<00:01:36.210> going<00:01:36.390> take

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
scale and you're basically going take

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.319 
scale and you're basically going take
this<00:01:36.840> out<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.560> C<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.790> you're<00:01:38.939> gonna<00:01:39.030> sharp

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
this out of the C and you're gonna sharp

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.240 
this out of the C and you're gonna sharp
it<00:01:39.540> so<00:01:39.960> we<00:01:40.110> have<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.229> sharp<00:01:40.560> four<00:01:40.860> in<00:01:41.070> there

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
it so we have a sharp four in there

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.160 
it so we have a sharp four in there
that's<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:41.729> sound<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.360> G<00:01:42.570> Lydian

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
that's that sound of a G Lydian

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.340 
that's that sound of a G Lydian
I'm<00:01:43.590> sure<00:01:43.770> what<00:01:44.009> I<00:01:44.040> mean<00:01:44.250> we<00:01:44.820> have<00:01:44.970> G

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:54.240 

a<00:01:49.320> B<00:01:51.360> c-sharp<00:01:52.360> that's<00:01:53.200> the<00:01:53.409> sound<00:01:53.680> of<00:01:53.830> G<00:01:54.009> lady

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
a B c-sharp that's the sound of G lady

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:09.990
