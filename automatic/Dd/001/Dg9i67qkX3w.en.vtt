00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 hi guys okay today I saw reply 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.160
 a tag on my hair, right? 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.840
 call my hair and I think I 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.840
 I never answered on this channel 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.420
 so I think it's serious on old channel neps 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.640
 that came from there I think I've 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.920
 had recorded and I did a search and saw 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.359
 which I had not done yet on this channel 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.699
 I think it's nice because I know there are people. 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.439
 who accompanies me always a hair 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.630
 curly but also very interesting 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.210
 which I think may be the curiosity of 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.000
 Someone then lets go and question is one 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.320
 What 's your oily hair type on it? 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.540
 normal dry 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.180
 my hair them and I think most 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.760
 of the curly hair are dry hair 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.350
 and that's it 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.180
 nowadays so I think he is 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.379
 much drier at the end and feel that we 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.260
 when a beautiful city arrives 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.140
 hydration 2 basically defines how it is 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.860
 your natural hair 13 with book side 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.649
 thin thick armed in the super- heavy 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.469
 my hair is natural it the box is 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:09.270
 natural that we are curly he is 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:10.080
 also thin is thin and I think 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.150
 it is 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.310
 I even thought I would lighten up a little bit 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.890
 so nothing more just a roll 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:22.170
 clearer that you find people nor 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:26.250
 suggestions will be cool on me that I 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.740
 I would like to know is 4 you have any 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:34.320
 type of hair chemistry there is more than one 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:37.590
 year to a year and six months I think back 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.860
 that I was relaxing at the root of 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.829
 hair just to leave him with less 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.840
 volume to turn the volume off and 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.640
 have more convince even though I do not 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.799
 so no kind of chemistry can not 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.500
 relax, I do not do anything so I think 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.299
 it so totally without natural chemistry 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.810
 use the same I think it's over or 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:01.850
 less is hitting here so I think it 's more 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:04.200
 or less, and after I started to 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.020
 wake up more my hair and do no more 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.640
 chemistry is actually after I quit 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.550
 to do the ironing is because 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.550
 I used to do it and then I 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.550
 I stopped 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.830
 is to do things that tend towards things 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.570
 hot like that baby liss 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.010
 after I stopped doing that in my hair 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.780
 I saw much improved over the 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.120
 growth is returning to normal 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.920
 so I remember my hair when 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.960
 was growing up very fast and 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.010
 when I started to do it with 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.840
 these things all 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.090
 He stopped like this, he never had a way 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.120
 none and I saw that it is now growing 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.530
 but I'm enjoying it, I want it to 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.070
 He grows a lot and I'm very 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:44.140
 I miss having a headache because it's when 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:50.320
 I was a kid had a head in the ass 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:51.910
 and I think about 14 years I think not 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.800
 I had to think about it. 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.350
 up to age 15 I had a big hair is 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.980
 huge I started to cut the let 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.080
 pine cone 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.700
 but he is returning to normal and I 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.470
 I'm very happy about this 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.170
 For who wants to be cool, I'm wearing it. 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.570
 the middle plane of the maybelline is that 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:12.010
 understands and always asks me then 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:15.280
 Talking here is finding me. 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:18.730
 5 What you like best in your hair 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.620
 I think I like the color the most, I 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.360
 I love this thing as faithful as I 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.060
 sign've thought several times face a 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.660
 A little more but I love this thing. 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.700
 really like 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.940
 if magic could do anything 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:33.239
 change in it what would be like more 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.239
 from khan 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.300
 ae 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:42.120
 I do not know well these days just one thing that 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:45.250
 I really wanted him to be 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.860
 so untrammeled life all the 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.930
 direct always to lose but the areas 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:52.600
 that it was a dog so that 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.820
 never comes down that embarrasses because I 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.650
 I find it horrible but it 's complicated 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:00.489
 will we have to taxed as soon as he 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:03.070
 will find it's never difficult is 7 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:07.570
 planning some change to cut long 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:09.820
 coloring analyze planning so even 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.870
 I do not want it so maybe a cut 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.730
 dry it 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.030
 I do not want to change the greeting I want 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:19.359
 that he grow up I said here but maybe 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:21.070
 cut as soon as he gets 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:24.580
 I do not know how the movement 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:26.290
 Kiss is eight 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.570
 Do you think it exists in hair? 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.630
 naturally beautiful or believes that it is 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.720
 impossible to show beautiful hair without 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:36.670
 some special care I 'm sure 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.620
 that there are naturally beautiful hair and 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:41.380
 You have a friend that I think if she wants to 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.330
 be without dye your hair forever will 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.480
 do it because it's that hair 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.820
 wonderful that you know is naturally 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:51.940
 Beautiful even though you wake up, it's already 

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:54.340
 Perfect and knows 9 Likes to take care of 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.590
 his hair alone or would rather leave 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.920
 nine professionals qualified by 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.600
 while I prefer to take care of him alone 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:04.000
 even because I do not know a 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.860
 qualified hair professional 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.410
 but it also depends on the care 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.870
 because right beware that gives to have 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:14.200

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:16.330
