00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
interesting and useful feature to

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:45.360 
interesting and useful feature to
actually<00:02:37.750> have<00:02:38.079> that<00:02:38.110> PC<00:02:39.010> settings<00:02:39.629> and<00:02:44.370> don't

actually have that PC settings and don't

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.940 
actually have that PC settings and don't
try<00:02:45.700> to<00:02:45.730> search<00:02:46.569> for<00:02:46.599> it<00:02:47.019> as<00:02:47.170> you<00:02:47.260> can<00:02:47.410> see<00:02:47.680> it's

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
try to search for it as you can see it's

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.680 
try to search for it as you can see it's
not<00:02:48.340> going<00:02:48.700> to<00:02:48.849> show<00:02:49.120> up<00:02:49.920> as<00:02:50.920> PC<00:02:51.519> settings<00:02:51.819> but

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
not going to show up as PC settings but

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.720 
not going to show up as PC settings but
you<00:02:52.870> will<00:02:53.019> have<00:02:53.230> settings<00:02:53.739> here<00:02:54.040> available

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
you will have settings here available

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.930 
you will have settings here available
and<00:02:55.209> then<00:02:55.510> you'll<00:02:55.690> have<00:02:55.870> change<00:02:56.230> PC<00:02:56.650> settings

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
and then you'll have change PC settings

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.789 
and then you'll have change PC settings
so<00:02:57.940> that's<00:02:58.060> another<00:02:58.359> way<00:02:58.540> of<00:02:58.569> accessing<00:02:59.290> it<00:02:59.409> if

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
so that's another way of accessing it if

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:01.619 
so that's another way of accessing it if
you<00:03:00.010> go<00:03:00.159> to<00:03:00.220> the<00:03:00.459> upper<00:03:00.760> lower<00:03:00.970> right<00:03:01.299> and

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:01.629 
you go to the upper lower right and

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:03.569 
you go to the upper lower right and
instead<00:03:02.200> of<00:03:02.500> going<00:03:02.680> to<00:03:02.799> the<00:03:02.890> settings<00:03:03.250> you<00:03:03.400> do

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
instead of going to the settings you do

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:07.140 
instead of going to the settings you do
search<00:03:03.989> one<00:03:04.989> thing<00:03:05.200> you<00:03:05.319> can<00:03:05.500> do<00:03:05.709> is<00:03:05.950> look<00:03:06.670> just

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
search one thing you can do is look just

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:08.759 
search one thing you can do is look just
below<00:03:07.359> the<00:03:07.510> search<00:03:07.840> box

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
below the search box

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.009 
below the search box
there's<00:03:09.099> settings<00:03:09.790> and<00:03:10.120> then<00:03:10.599> you'll<00:03:10.780> have

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
there's settings and then you'll have

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:15.690

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
course if you type PC settings and then

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.870 
course if you type PC settings and then
you'll<00:03:22.299> have<00:03:22.620> change<00:03:23.620> PC<00:03:24.069> settings<00:03:24.099> on<00:03:24.700> the

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
left so you can actually search for it

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.190 
left so you can actually search for it
in<00:03:28.690> that<00:03:29.349> way<00:03:30.269> it's<00:03:31.269> unfortunate<00:03:31.959> that<00:03:31.989> they

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
in that way it's unfortunate that they

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.360 
in that way it's unfortunate that they
did<00:03:32.410> not<00:03:32.700> actually<00:03:33.700> put<00:03:34.599> the<00:03:34.690> search

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
did not actually put the search

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.039 
did not actually put the search
immediate<00:03:36.370> search<00:03:36.639> for<00:03:36.970> everything<00:03:37.720> it

immediate search for everything it

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.250 
immediate search for everything it
really<00:03:38.440> is<00:03:39.000> in<00:03:40.000> the<00:03:40.269> settings<00:03:40.660> section<00:03:40.900> that

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
really is in the settings section that

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.280 
really is in the settings section that
you<00:03:41.410> have<00:03:41.620> to<00:03:41.799> put<00:03:42.069> yourself<00:03:42.549> into<00:03:43.079> before<00:03:44.079> you

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
you have to put yourself into before you

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.879 
you have to put yourself into before you
can<00:03:44.470> actually<00:03:44.620> type<00:03:45.160> to<00:03:45.400> search<00:03:45.669> PC<00:03:46.299> settings
