although<00:00:40.200> I<00:00:40.230> guess<00:00:40.469> you<00:00:40.559> can<00:00:40.710> say<00:00:40.890> some<00:00:41.129> room

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
although I guess you can say some room

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.520 
although I guess you can say some room
to<00:00:41.489> breathe<00:00:41.520> which<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.540> good<00:00:44.450> and<00:00:45.450> on<00:00:46.170> the

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
to breathe which is good and on the

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.830 
to breathe which is good and on the
reason<00:00:46.890> I<00:00:46.950> got<00:00:47.129> this<00:00:47.340> is<00:00:47.399> for<00:00:47.820> all<00:00:48.000> two<00:00:48.329> reasons

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
reason I got this is for all two reasons

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.619 
reason I got this is for all two reasons
I<00:00:48.930> got<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.379> one<00:00:49.680> because<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.399> compression<00:00:50.969> and

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
I got it one because of compression and

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.860 
I got it one because of compression and
two<00:00:51.930> because<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.850> lies<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.600> get<00:00:54.750> on<00:00:54.840> my

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
two because of the lies that I get on my

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.260 
two because of the lies that I get on my
forehead<00:00:55.379> from<00:00:55.949> using<00:00:56.219> my<00:00:56.430> original<00:00:56.910> direct

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270
