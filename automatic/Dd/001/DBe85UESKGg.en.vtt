definitely<00:04:33.230> some<00:04:34.100> kind<00:04:34.250> of<00:04:34.340> issue<00:04:34.520> but<00:04:34.670> I<00:04:35.270> just

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
definitely some kind of issue but I just

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.600 
definitely some kind of issue but I just
noticed<00:04:36.050> that<00:04:36.290> when<00:04:36.560> I<00:04:36.650> put<00:04:36.860> it<00:04:36.980> it<00:04:37.130> gets<00:04:37.340> warm

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
noticed that when I put it it gets warm

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:39.520 
noticed that when I put it it gets warm
it<00:04:38.090> doesn't<00:04:38.420> have<00:04:38.540> charged<00:04:38.840> this<00:04:39.020> fast<00:04:39.320> is

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
it doesn't have charged this fast is

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.290 
it doesn't have charged this fast is
connecting<00:04:40.010> the<00:04:40.100> cable<00:04:40.460> I<00:04:40.610> saw<00:04:41.000> it<00:04:41.120> and<00:04:41.210> it

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
connecting the cable I saw it and it

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.150 
connecting the cable I saw it and it
takes<00:04:41.450> a<00:04:41.570> little<00:04:41.720> longer<00:04:42.010> especially<00:04:43.010> if<00:04:43.100> you

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
takes a little longer especially if you

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.190 
takes a little longer especially if you
put<00:04:43.340> a<00:04:43.370> case<00:04:43.640> on<00:04:43.880> it<00:04:43.940> it's<00:04:44.480> going<00:04:44.750> to<00:04:44.810> take<00:04:45.170> a

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
put a case on it it's going to take a

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.560 
put a case on it it's going to take a
little<00:04:45.410> longer<00:04:45.530> to<00:04:45.800> charge<00:04:46.090> but<00:04:47.090> it's

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
little longer to charge but it's

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:49.030 
little longer to charge but it's
definitely<00:04:48.080> very<00:04:48.200> convenient<00:04:48.740> you<00:04:48.890> don't

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 
definitely very convenient you don't

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.710 
definitely very convenient you don't
have<00:04:49.190> to<00:04:49.370> fund<00:04:49.670> over<00:04:49.850> on<00:04:49.940> with<00:04:50.120> the<00:04:50.210> cable

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
have to fund over on with the cable

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.570 
have to fund over on with the cable
you<00:04:51.020> just<00:04:51.200> put<00:04:51.380> it<00:04:51.500> on<00:04:51.590> top<00:04:51.740> of<00:04:51.800> it<00:04:52.040> and<00:04:52.220> leave

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
you just put it on top of it and leave

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.430 
you just put it on top of it and leave
it<00:04:52.730> so<00:04:53.000> this<00:04:53.180> is<00:04:53.330> great<00:04:53.570> to<00:04:53.690> have<00:04:53.810> next<00:04:54.170> to<00:04:54.320> your
