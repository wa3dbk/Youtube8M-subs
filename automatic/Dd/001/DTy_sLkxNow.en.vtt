 one 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.029
 welcome one more day besides the state at home 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.570
 the program promoted by the general college of farm managers of 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:32.300
 Spain 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.830
 whose purpose is to publicize aspects related to housing and the home 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.370
 As always we started by asking the street about the topic that will focus 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:41.660
 our space today 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:42.790
 the pools 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.550
 private and community 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.750
 which regulations must be observed by the users of the private pool 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:50.620
 aa 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.090
 mercedes contribution 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.730
 the teacher defines them 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.320
 it's not new pantene the good 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.630
 n clean the space the ce i will take me dogs 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.280
 p the regulation 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.850
 evelyn from the security rules a little to know about everything what the 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.100
 lifeguard 'st 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.950
 and that they are monitored in that aspect 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.220
 especially for Argentines not 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.450
 well keep it clean to go in good condition 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.400
 I just like I have a private pool because if what I'm worth 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.090
 that is clean 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.990
 the bow and in 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.480
 so that it is clean especially that there is not much chlorine because it harms the 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:32.360
 eyes 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.610
 Please play some rules that community pools should observe 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.030
 Community pools solace 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.049
 the lifeguard yes that is true 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:44.910
 once made in conditions 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.950
 although the maintenance in little or in that sense 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.500
 ap west more of the same and created but that double prepaid to is 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.950
 Community can 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.470
 well that this in rule water is to say that it is in good condition what 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.180
 in this green or social p 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.940
 it's good that on this there is a person dedicated to maintenance 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.299
 specific pool 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:11.399
 they skip a community of neighbors 

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:13.629
 josÃ© duarte the gorges 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:17.579
 because the community good people are equal private or 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:19.129
 community 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:21.569
 it has to be clean especially clean 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.569
 what should be done to restrict entry to community pools 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.870
 that's why it depends on each community but 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.310
 per cent above all I think that percent should be the exclusive use of 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:35.209
 neighbors 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:36.299
 they were posse 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:38.519
 is the age in the case of the ere 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:45.280
 already in 1915 with responsible parents or guardian tutors is not that the cea 

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:51.069
 some people who watch so that those who are not from the community do not enter 

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:55.489
 and now that we know what answers our fellow citizens give us 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.489
 It's up to us to clarify the issue 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:03.260
 in Spain and six hundred thousand pools 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.569
 the vast majority of which for private use but there are also more than 10 thousand 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.109
 that are community 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:12.699
 for those that are private there is no type of regulation on 

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:16.479
 so safety measures cleaning and water purification 

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:20.979
 so that it is the user himself who must take the appropriate measures that 

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:25.349
 dictate the uses and customs the community pools of urbanizations 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:29.919
 instead they are subject to a series of legal norms of conduct 

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:34.169
 the internal regime regulation for example establishes the annual period of 

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:38.939
 opening the hours of use and, where appropriate, the schedule set for short courses 

00:03:38.939 --> 00:03:42.879
 swimming gave three activities as standards of conduct that are usually set 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:47.159
 It is usually obligatory to wear sportswear 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:51.599
 bar the shower cap shower before entering the water and not introduce creams 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:55.709
 no polluting liquids is also prohibited playing with balls comes with 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.399
 animals or eating and drinking outside the areas designated for that purpose 

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:03.790
 Since the presence of a lifeguard is mandatory, their 

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:08.369
 constructions that with this one will be legitimized to expel from the enclosure to 

00:04:08.369 --> 00:04:11.549
 who could endanger the physical integrity of other users 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:16.269
 the homeowner's community a restricted access system that 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.400
 consists of a badge to display at the entrance in order to delimit the 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.979
 number of people invited you can set a number of invitations to 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:26.360
 every owner 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:30.759
 the community in any case c responsible for the correct functioning 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:33.879
 go to the security of the enclosure 

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:36.289
 in case we do not know some 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:40.520
 If we still want to be better informed, it is best to go though ministados de 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.319
 collegiate farms 

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:45.319
 now the time has come to answer your questions 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.150
 tarno 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:53.710
 Who is responsible for cleaning the fair 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.530
 beyond that the municipal cleaning services happen 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:57.740
 regularly 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.319
 the cleaning of the sidewalk up to two meters from the facade corresponds to the farm 

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:06.289
 either because this job is assigned to the goalkeeper or because there is a 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:08.240
 cleaning company 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.410
 reality nevertheless ended up certifying that those who assume this 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:16.470
 task without being obligated we are shops of the farm for a simple 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:20.380
 question of image of face to the clients we are with her we hold to us 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.840
 the station of cinca 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.669
 to the community 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:25.080
 the law does not obligate to have 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.610
 a farm manager when this position is exercised by one of the owners 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.020
 of the farm 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:33.270
 However, it is convenient to hire an administrator 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.270
 Collegiate farms due to their professional qualification 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.620
 normally they were also assigned the role of community secretary 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.490
 It was mandatory because it is responsible for keeping up to date 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:50.110
 all the bureaucratic procedures make the calls the minutes of 

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:53.129
 the meetings the relevant certifications 

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:57.219
 The administrator also managed the due dates and liquidation of the 

00:05:57.219 --> 00:05:58.110
 receipts 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.689
 the relationship with public administrations 

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:03.689
 know the companies of services of repairs and works 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:09.139
 When you hire a property manager, make sure that it is 

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:10.289
 college 

00:06:10.289 --> 00:06:13.500
 this is a guarantee on its preparation and solvency and 

00:06:13.499 --> 00:06:16.129
 any complaint that may have 

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:19.129
 do not 

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:22.849
 up here in our project 

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:25.229
 We hope we helped 

00:06:25.229 --> 00:06:28.869
 we meet again tomorrow here the administrator at home 

00:06:36.809 --> 00:06:37.169
 each
