00:00:00.939 --> 00:00:04.960
 for me the ceiba janet besides collana place miguel antártica de 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:11.129
 painting because it turns out that something that you forget actor like the 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:11.860
 world 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.240
 it was the family passed 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.610
 and until Daniel rock and fast affirmed the Dominican omar now always 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:24.410
 I have my idea is to throw and as already painted logically apply a good paint 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:25.280
 cute 

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.900
 My doll from the expo mag alarte seems like a little bit to me but 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:30.360
 that audience 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.319
 there was a ship that is to advance if it is like copper 

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:37.920
 as all and all you put pomar alarte 2010 and now I feel good 

00:00:37.919 --> 00:00:40.670
 super proud that way I paint 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.739
 remember that to paint as I always tell you, you have to have ghana creativity 

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:45.929
 what tomorrow we have 

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:51.100
 a workshop at 10 o'clock in the morning you paint on flannel then if you 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.079
 want to be born his flannel paint learn different kind of techniques only 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:59.789
 you have to call me politics on my tremendous moon website so that 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.550
 see all the information that we have about our 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.270
 for you are instant and for the ugliness always public 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.229
 on the page of my mind a crafts opened a new group will 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.610
 call thousand a craft there they will get the information because my 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.560
 previous to split Miriam and my moon this foul I can not accept anyone else 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.899
 I want to accept the table but we have reached 5 thousand people 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:29.450
 so we had to open a good group the pass 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.470
 auto to see the colors that we will use to paint the cookie 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.050
 we here I have different colors we are going to go for the tones that 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.060
 those of the colors poker 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:46.270
 so here we have a color that is like what we bring, but it happens to us 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.500
 more intense in perfect color that will help me to paint the cookie 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.179
 incident 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:56.759
 also here I have a yellow if you have a similar hue in 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.780
 any other brand can do it right 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:00.730
 so 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.610
 let's make the base of the fika street of ginger 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:07.880
 here place my color painting cooperen 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.079
 always remember that when we are painting on flannel we have 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:13.760
 to give 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.139
 the circular movement 

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:18.369
 wing next to the brush 

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:21.510
 because because that way we get 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.719
 what between 

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:25.529
 the paint on the cloth 

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:30.290
 because avecal people that sometimes when they paint they forget 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.390
 give that movement to the brush and logically the paint does not go 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.739
 adhered 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.739
 to the flannel I here previously 

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:43.599
 they practiced the statute that peace 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.599
 a base of the same colors that I'm working with 

00:02:47.279 --> 00:02:51.299
 for what percent or previously we knew what we should do 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:56.589
 If you replace the base right now I will be working more than anything 

00:02:56.589 --> 00:03:01.650
 with light wake very placing 15 kilos the aee position 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.910
 a yellow color more clarito because because I need to sacal the local 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.690
 septic to this street explains things remember dear friend do not have to 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:16.820
 paint the flat ones there whenever you put the lights lizón 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:23.290
 dra i logically we put the little color we give circular movement i 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.100
 we blur it to the other color already that way
