00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:06.370
 in this opportunity we have a solar kit 

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:09.219
 for power cut consisting of a 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:13.000
 300 watt power inverter one 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:16.250
 12 gaulle battery 333 amper a 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.430
 charge controller and a solar panel 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:22.970
 the power inverter comes box 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:25.070
 Closed original wrapped with two sets 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.160
 of cables one for the cigarette lighter 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:32.840
 vehicle and the other for direct connection 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:35.820
 to battery with a fuse protection 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.980
 let's proceed to see 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.079
 unit 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.230
 let's take in this case for the 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.079
 show the cable that comes with the 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:50.000
 crocodiles for connection in the battery 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:53.070
 in the back they look clearly 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.170
 red for the positive terminal black for 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.300
 the negative terminal and a ground output 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.150
 if it is left fixed , the 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.060
 terminals the cables strongly 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.460
 thought 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:09.540
 the crocodiles 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:13.830
 the negative on the negative terminal and the 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:16.409
 positive about the positive terminal there the 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.770
 unit was on we could appreciate 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.440
 the audible alarm that made us see that 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.020
 it was on we're going to turn off 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.210
 the equipment and start over can be 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.119
 see two LEDs one red and one green that 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.250
 are off we turn on the unit it 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.759
 both will turn on and 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.399
 staying the green light on that 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.460
 means that the unit is already ready 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.300
 to deliver about 220 volts and current 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.210
 stabilized 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:49.020
 let's see in this case let's try 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:52.229
 show a led reflector to see that 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.720
 there is stream delivery the reflector 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.520
 is not included in the kit is only to 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:01.659
 demonstrative character 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.880
 the unit is turned on delivering 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.360
 stabilized current waiting for 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:08.590
 we plug in any type of device 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.140
 we could also connect some 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.019
 sneakers and so power several consumptions 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.690
 in a simultaneous manner that does not exceed 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:20.049
 consumption of a maximum of 300 watts 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.270
 adding all the components this is a 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:24.070
 kit 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.890
 perfect for use in cuts 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:29.260
 of energy does not gather fuel 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.350
 totally eco-friendly with a battery that 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.870
 lasts between 8 and 10 years of useful life 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:37.540
 then the next day you have the panel 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.580
 solar and the load regulator with 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.090
 which will recover the panel load 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:46.630
 sun battery very easy the panel 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:50.860
 Solar includes on its back a 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:53.920
 red and black and black cable set 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:56.730
 where is positive and negative the 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.980
 charge regulator has on his forehead 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.870
 two positive or negative drawings for 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.120
 positive and negative battery for 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.340
 solar panel here you should connect the 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.770
 cables that are going to come from the solar panel 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.410
 have drawings for the positive solar and 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.810
 negative and those that will get positive 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.130
 negative direct to the battery this 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.920
 shape 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.830
 during daylight hours the solar panel 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:24.160
 reintroduce cargo to the team 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:26.320
 battery and you can have in cuts 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.200
 long power always in supply 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.570
 electrical with this kit you can have 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.960
 lighting every night lamps 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:37.330
 low consumption or read how many lamps two 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.610
 three four lamps five lamps the 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.370
 use of the lamps while they are low 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:45.640
 led consumption is not significant may 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:48.300
 reload cell you can have an hour 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:51.730
 a television or fan time 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:53.920
 but the kit is basically thought 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.570
 for lighting and cellular charging 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.970
 how much autonomy 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:00.480
 all night 12 days without any 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.480
 problem 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.270
 to consult more products you can 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:13.300
 visit our website www dot 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:15.370
 solar and wind puntocom score for 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:18.820
 pay the unit 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:21.100
 the off and there is no longer ready delivery 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.780
 of energy 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:28.030
 to remove it you remove a terminal 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:31.030
 Turn on the computer, download the 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:33.610
 capacitors and retires the other does not matter 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.830
 place first there are no more currents 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:40.810
 inside the computer and you can 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:43.200
 save the parts separately many 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.200
 Thank you
