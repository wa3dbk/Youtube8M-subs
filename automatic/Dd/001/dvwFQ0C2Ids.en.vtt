GPS as well as a functioning compass and

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.719 
GPS as well as a functioning compass and
it's<00:01:16.439> three<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:16.979> half<00:01:17.009> inch<00:01:17.400> touchscreen

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
it's three and a half inch touchscreen

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.580 
it's three and a half inch touchscreen
which<00:01:18.509> i'm<00:01:18.630> going<00:01:18.689> to<00:01:18.810> show<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:18.960> in<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.200> second

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
which i'm going to show you in a second

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.100 
which i'm going to show you in a second
is<00:01:19.680> 0<00:01:19.979> led-based<00:01:20.640> rather<00:01:21.119> than<00:01:21.390> traditional

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
is 0 led-based rather than traditional

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.950 
is 0 led-based rather than traditional
TFT<00:01:23.100> so<00:01:23.430> that's<00:01:23.640> really<00:01:23.850> nice<00:01:24.119> also<00:01:24.570> high

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
TFT so that's really nice also high

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.749 
TFT so that's really nice also high
pixel<00:01:25.320> count<00:01:25.560> I<00:01:25.650> believe<00:01:25.890> it's<00:01:26.159> over<00:01:26.460> a

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
pixel count I believe it's over a

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.510 
pixel count I believe it's over a
million<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:27.509> that's<00:01:27.689> definitely<00:01:28.530> part<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.430> the

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
million so that's definitely part of the

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.520 
million so that's definitely part of the
reason<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:29.880> this<00:01:30.150> camera<00:01:30.600> Garner's<00:01:31.020> the

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
reason that this camera Garner's the

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.590 
reason that this camera Garner's the
highest<00:01:32.220> price<00:01:32.460> point<00:01:32.790> in<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.030> point<00:01:33.299> shoot

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
highest price point in the point shoot

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.780 
highest price point in the point shoot
