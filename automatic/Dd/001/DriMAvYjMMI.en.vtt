00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
something that would you know really

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.929 
something that would you know really
work<00:01:30.780> for<00:01:30.810> my<00:01:30.990> skin<00:01:31.229> type<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.650> I've<00:01:32.070> got<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.610> lot

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
work for my skin type and I've got a lot

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.850

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
of breakouts here on the side so I

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.520 
of breakouts here on the side so I
thought<00:01:35.280> it<00:01:35.400> was<00:01:35.490> very<00:01:35.520> noticeable<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.540> yeah

one<00:01:51.479> place<00:01:51.600> i've<00:01:51.810> seen<00:01:52.049> i<00:01:52.079> think<00:01:52.409> i<00:01:52.439> saw<00:01:52.619> at<00:01:52.710> CBS

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
one place i've seen i think i saw at CBS

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.260 
one place i've seen i think i saw at CBS
actually<00:01:53.460> I<00:01:53.490> think<00:01:53.640> it's<00:01:53.850> like<00:01:54.030> maybe

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
actually I think it's like maybe

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.969 
actually I think it's like maybe
fourteen<00:01:54.840> dollars<00:01:55.020> or<00:01:55.380> something<00:01:55.740> but

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
fourteen dollars or something but

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.920 
fourteen dollars or something but
honestly<00:01:56.969> it's<00:01:57.119> so<00:01:57.299> worth<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:57.600> it's<00:01:57.780> such<00:01:57.899> a

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
honestly it's so worth it it's such a

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.440 
honestly it's so worth it it's such a
big<00:01:58.170> bottle<00:01:58.439> too<00:01:58.829> so<00:01:59.100> like<00:01:59.280> it's<00:01:59.579> definitely

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
big bottle too so like it's definitely

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.959 
big bottle too so like it's definitely
worth<00:02:00.630> it<00:02:00.750> i<00:02:00.869> really<00:02:01.170> like<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:01.590> on<00:02:01.969> it

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
worth it i really like it on it

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.830 
worth it i really like it on it
definitely<00:02:03.950> helps<00:02:04.950> clear<00:02:05.280> out<00:02:05.399> your<00:02:05.430> skin<00:02:05.840> it

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
definitely helps clear out your skin it

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.749 
definitely helps clear out your skin it
is<00:02:07.110> sometimes<00:02:07.350> a<00:02:07.649> little<00:02:07.890> bit<00:02:08.039> drying<00:02:08.280> for<00:02:08.580> my

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
is sometimes a little bit drying for my

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.190 
is sometimes a little bit drying for my
but<00:02:09.060> that's<00:02:09.179> probably<00:02:09.420> just<00:02:09.539> because<00:02:09.690> mines

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
but that's probably just because mines

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.260 
but that's probably just because mines
for<00:02:10.410> the<00:02:10.440> oily<00:02:10.890> skin<00:02:11.160> normal<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.730> oily<00:02:11.849> skin
