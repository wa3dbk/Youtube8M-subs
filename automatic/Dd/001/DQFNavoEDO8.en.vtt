now<00:02:13.960> now<00:02:14.710> this<00:02:14.890> may<00:02:15.069> seem<00:02:15.130> like<00:02:15.370> a<00:02:15.520> bit<00:02:15.910> much

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
now now this may seem like a bit much

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.550 
now now this may seem like a bit much
when<00:02:16.390> all<00:02:16.450> you<00:02:16.569> want<00:02:16.720> to<00:02:16.780> do<00:02:16.870> is<00:02:16.990> sack<00:02:17.200> out<00:02:17.380> and

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
when all you want to do is sack out and

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.440 
when all you want to do is sack out and
watch<00:02:17.710> a<00:02:17.860> movie<00:02:17.890> seems<00:02:18.760> that<00:02:18.880> way<00:02:19.000> to<00:02:19.030> me

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
watch a movie seems that way to me

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.540 
watch a movie seems that way to me
but<00:02:19.720> this<00:02:20.290> definitely<00:02:20.680> shows<00:02:20.740> the<00:02:21.100> potential

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
but this definitely shows the potential

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.480 
but this definitely shows the potential
of<00:02:21.880> the<00:02:22.210> TV<00:02:22.510> tablet<00:02:22.780> marriage<00:02:23.260> and<00:02:24.040> of<00:02:24.250> course

of the TV tablet marriage and of course

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.550 
of the TV tablet marriage and of course
any<00:02:24.760> tablet<00:02:25.390> can<00:02:25.569> handle<00:02:25.840> the<00:02:25.960> web<00:02:26.200> which

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
any tablet can handle the web which

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.410 
any tablet can handle the web which
means<00:02:26.770> you<00:02:26.860> can<00:02:27.010> jump<00:02:27.250> into<00:02:27.460> chats<00:02:27.880> or<00:02:28.150> fan

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
means you can jump into chats or fan

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.300 
means you can jump into chats or fan

first of all this guy doesn't fit in the

first of all this guy doesn't fit in the

palm of your hand like a regular remote
weighs<00:03:06.180> a<00:03:06.210> bit<00:03:06.450> more<00:03:06.780> -<00:03:07.020> by<00:03:07.230> the<00:03:07.290> way<00:03:07.440> the

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
weighs a bit more - by the way the

regular remote and if you have it set

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.010 
regular remote and if you have it set
properly<00:03:12.090> it's<00:03:12.210> probably<00:03:12.450> always<00:03:12.600> turning

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
properly it's probably always turning

can<00:03:15.360> be<00:03:15.390> some<00:03:15.600> drawbacks<00:03:16.010> now<00:03:17.010> so<00:03:17.280> far<00:03:17.520> this

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
can be some drawbacks now so far this

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.880 
can be some drawbacks now so far this
has<00:03:17.940> all<00:03:18.090> been<00:03:18.120> about<00:03:18.510> the<00:03:18.810> TV<00:03:19.290> at<00:03:19.410> the<00:03:19.560> center

it<00:03:22.290> but<00:03:22.620> it<00:03:22.740> goes<00:03:22.950> the<00:03:23.160> other<00:03:23.190> way<00:03:23.610> as<00:03:23.880> well<00:03:23.940> for

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
it but it goes the other way as well for
