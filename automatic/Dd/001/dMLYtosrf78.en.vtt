Instruments<00:00:11.130> some<00:00:12.030> of<00:00:12.150> you<00:00:12.240> guys<00:00:12.389> might<00:00:13.019> be

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
Instruments some of you guys might be

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.259 
Instruments some of you guys might be
familiar<00:00:13.320> with<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.679> kontrol<00:00:14.009> s4<00:00:14.190> let's<00:00:15.059> have

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
familiar with the kontrol s4 let's have

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.349 
familiar with the kontrol s4 let's have
a<00:00:15.299> look<00:00:15.540> at<00:00:15.660> that<00:00:15.809> first<00:00:16.170> in<00:00:16.440> comparison<00:00:17.359> as

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
a look at that first in comparison as

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.740 
a look at that first in comparison as
you<00:00:18.480> can<00:00:18.570> see<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:19.020> s2<00:00:19.710> is<00:00:19.980> just<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:20.850> little<00:00:21.420> bit

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
you can see the s2 is just a little bit

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.179 
you can see the s2 is just a little bit
smaller<00:00:22.680> than<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.850> s4<00:00:24.330> but<00:00:24.900> actually<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.890> jog

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
smaller than the s4 but actually the jog

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.779 
smaller than the s4 but actually the jog
wheels<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.090> line<00:00:27.599> faders<00:00:28.140> are<00:00:28.789> identical

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
wheels and the line faders are identical

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.669 
wheels and the line faders are identical
we<00:00:30.210> went<00:00:30.390> ahead<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.630> measured<00:00:30.990> ourselves

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
we went ahead and measured ourselves

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.370 
we went ahead and measured ourselves
they<00:00:32.160> are<00:00:32.340> absolutely<00:00:33.030> identical<00:00:33.270> some<00:00:34.260> of

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
they are absolutely identical some of

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.139 
they are absolutely identical some of
the<00:00:34.469> differences<00:00:34.829> that<00:00:35.070> you'll<00:00:35.219> find<00:00:35.280> the

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
the differences that you'll find the

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.420 
the differences that you'll find the
outputs<00:00:36.719> pretty<00:00:37.440> much<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.829> same<00:00:38.010> you've<00:00:38.280> got

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
outputs pretty much the same you've got

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.290 
outputs pretty much the same you've got
balance<00:00:38.879> TRS<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.600> RCA<00:00:40.260> now<00:00:41.129> you<00:00:41.550> do<00:00:41.760> have<00:00:42.030> a

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
balance TRS and RCA now you do have a

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.270 
balance TRS and RCA now you do have a
booth<00:00:42.600> output<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:43.410> can<00:00:43.559> actually<00:00:43.710> select<00:00:44.040> the

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
booth output you can actually select the

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.549 
booth output you can actually select the
rca's<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.969> be<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.090> booth<00:00:45.329> output<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:46.200> did<00:00:46.440> not

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
rca's to be a booth output that did not

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.350 
rca's to be a booth output that did not
exist<00:00:46.770> on<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.190> s4<00:00:47.309> cheers<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.120> native

instruments for getting us that you also
don't<00:00:50.700> have<00:00:50.820> DBS<00:00:51.360> support<00:00:51.809> for<00:00:51.989> this<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.710> only

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
don't have DBS support for this you only

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.180 
don't have DBS support for this you only
have<00:00:53.280> one<00:00:53.610> TRS<00:00:54.449> input<00:00:55.079> most<00:00:55.649> of<00:00:55.800> you<00:00:55.890> guys<00:00:55.949> are

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
have one TRS input most of you guys are

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.250 
have one TRS input most of you guys are
going<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.370> use<00:00:56.520> that<00:00:56.550> for<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.910> microphone<00:00:57.510> so

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
section on the s2 it's going to be

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.660 
section on the s2 it's going to be
pretty<00:01:09.840> much<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.200> same<00:01:10.590> except<00:01:11.400> you're<00:01:11.549> going

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
so the effects section on the s2 it

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.270 
so the effects section on the s2 it
looks<00:01:41.750> identical<00:01:41.930> but<00:01:42.470> it's<00:01:42.619> just<00:01:42.979> a<00:01:43.130> little

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
looks identical but it's just a little

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.830 
looks identical but it's just a little
bit<00:01:43.490> different<00:01:43.850> you're<00:01:44.570> going<00:01:44.689> to<00:01:44.750> have

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
bit different you're going to have

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.139 
bit different you're going to have
control<00:01:45.290> over<00:01:45.500> other<00:01:46.040> chain<00:01:46.460> defect<00:01:46.850> or<00:01:47.000> an

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:47.149 
control over other chain defect or an

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:50.050 
control over other chain defect or an
advanced<00:01:47.539> effect<00:01:47.990> on<00:01:48.229> the<00:01:48.560> s2<00:01:49.100> now<00:01:49.670> on<00:01:49.820> the<00:01:49.880> s4

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
advanced effect on the s2 now on the s4

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.880 
advanced effect on the s2 now on the s4
you<00:01:50.570> had<00:01:50.659> control<00:01:50.810> of<00:01:51.229> four<00:01:51.680> different

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
you had control of four different

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.100 
you had control of four different
effects<00:01:52.369> in<00:01:52.549> advanced<00:01:52.909> mode<00:01:53.180> you're<00:01:53.689> not<00:01:53.930> able

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
effects in advanced mode you're not able

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.580 
effects in advanced mode you're not able
to<00:01:54.380> do<00:01:54.560> that<00:01:54.740> on<00:01:54.979> the<00:01:55.250> s2<00:01:55.820> you<00:01:56.689> also<00:01:56.930> do<00:01:57.409> not

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
to do that on the s2 you also do not

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.820 
to do that on the s2 you also do not
have<00:01:57.890> a<00:01:57.920> dedicated<00:01:58.340> filter<00:01:59.060> knob<00:01:59.270> so<00:02:00.229> if<00:02:00.680> you

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
have a dedicated filter knob so if you

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.070 
have a dedicated filter knob so if you
want<00:02:01.039> to<00:02:01.100> adjust<00:02:01.250> the<00:02:01.610> filter<00:02:02.060> on<00:02:02.300> each<00:02:02.720> deck

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
want to adjust the filter on each deck

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.590 
want to adjust the filter on each deck
you<00:02:03.560> just<00:02:03.770> hit<00:02:03.920> shift<00:02:04.190> and<00:02:04.550> you<00:02:05.179> can<00:02:05.300> use<00:02:05.450> the

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
you just hit shift and you can use the

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.499 
you just hit shift and you can use the
game<00:02:05.840> to<00:02:06.440> control<00:02:07.130> the<00:02:07.340> filter<00:02:07.700> that's<00:02:08.149> very

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
game to control the filter that's very

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.900 
game to control the filter that's very
nice<00:02:08.769> ok<00:02:09.769> so<00:02:09.830> let's<00:02:10.100> talk<00:02:10.280> about<00:02:10.340> the<00:02:10.670> decks

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
nice ok so let's talk about the decks

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.970 
nice ok so let's talk about the decks
you've<00:02:11.239> got<00:02:11.420> control<00:02:11.600> of<00:02:12.110> two<00:02:12.410> decks<00:02:12.680> on<00:02:12.860> the

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
you've got control of two decks on the
