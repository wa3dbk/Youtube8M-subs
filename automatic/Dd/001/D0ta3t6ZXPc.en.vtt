00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:10.910 
salt and rubbing it into a cucumber this

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.539 
salt and rubbing it into a cucumber this
will<00:00:11.389> remove<00:00:11.660> what's<00:00:11.959> known<00:00:12.200> as<00:00:12.440> a<00:00:12.709> coup<00:00:12.950> which

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:13.549 
will remove what's known as a coup which

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:15.670 
will remove what's known as a coup which
is<00:00:13.820> a<00:00:14.029> little<00:00:14.299> bit<00:00:14.359> of<00:00:14.480> bitterness<00:00:14.840> and<00:00:15.199> will

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:15.680 
is a little bit of bitterness and will

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.790 
is a little bit of bitterness and will
make<00:00:15.830> your<00:00:15.949> cucumber<00:00:16.460> much<00:00:16.699> more<00:00:17.060> sweeter<00:00:17.800> so

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
make your cucumber much more sweeter so

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.830 
make your cucumber much more sweeter so
I<00:00:18.830> just<00:00:19.100> rub<00:00:19.430> it<00:00:19.460> in<00:00:19.820> and<00:00:20.029> then<00:00:20.330> leave<00:00:20.630> the

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:20.840 
I just rub it in and then leave the

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.600 
I just rub it in and then leave the
cucumber<00:00:21.410> to<00:00:21.439> sit<00:00:21.769> for<00:00:21.980> about<00:00:22.160> two<00:00:22.430> to<00:00:22.580> three

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:22.610 
cucumber to sit for about two to three

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.390 
cucumber to sit for about two to three
minutes<00:00:23.180> so<00:00:23.420> the<00:00:23.630> salt<00:00:23.870> has<00:00:24.080> time<00:00:24.380> to<00:00:24.680> remove

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
minutes so the salt has time to remove

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.810 
minutes so the salt has time to remove
the<00:00:25.580> ague<00:00:25.910> and<00:00:26.170> then<00:00:27.170> you<00:00:27.530> wash<00:00:27.890> your<00:00:28.190> cucumber

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
the ague and then you wash your cucumber

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.029 
the ague and then you wash your cucumber
in<00:00:29.000> abundant<00:00:29.810> water<00:00:30.080> this<00:00:30.260> is<00:00:30.440> probably<00:00:30.800> too

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:31.039 
in abundant water this is probably too

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:32.950 
in abundant water this is probably too
much<00:00:31.220> water<00:00:31.490> but<00:00:31.910> just<00:00:31.970> how<00:00:32.329> long<00:00:32.360> you<00:00:32.629> can<00:00:32.750> tap

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
much water but just how long you can tap

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:33.819 
much water but just how long you can tap
will<00:00:33.199> do<00:00:33.320> fine

fins<00:01:56.130> now<00:01:56.880> I'm<00:01:57.060> going<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.300> cut<00:01:57.510> out<00:01:57.630> the

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
fins now I'm going to cut out the

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.070 
fins now I'm going to cut out the
pectoral<00:01:58.320> fins<00:01:58.790> leaving<00:01:59.790> a<00:02:00.030> section<00:02:00.810> still

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
pectoral fins leaving a section still

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.870 
pectoral fins leaving a section still
attached<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.410> the<00:02:01.650> bodies<00:02:01.950> or<00:02:02.100> two<00:02:02.310> cuts<00:02:02.640> on

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
attached to the bodies or two cuts on

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.109 
attached to the bodies or two cuts on
both<00:02:02.960> sides<00:02:04.760> just<00:02:05.760> like<00:02:05.850> so<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:07.940> then<00:02:08.940> you

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
both sides just like so and then you

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.270 
both sides just like so and then you
place<00:02:09.390> your<00:02:09.570> knife<00:02:09.780> flat<00:02:10.709> against<00:02:11.160> the

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
place your knife flat against the

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.670 
place your knife flat against the
surface<00:02:11.490> of<00:02:11.820> the<00:02:11.880> cucumber<00:02:12.270> on<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:13.440> curved

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
surface of the cucumber on the curved

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.810 
surface of the cucumber on the curved
side<00:02:13.860> of<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.160> fins<00:02:14.490> and<00:02:15.500> then<00:02:16.500> you<00:02:16.620> just<00:02:16.890> cut

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
side of the fins and then you just cut

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.410 
side of the fins and then you just cut
leaving<00:02:18.450> them<00:02:18.720> still<00:02:18.989> attached<00:02:19.380> on<00:02:19.860> both

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
leaving them still attached on both

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.949 
leaving them still attached on both
sides<00:02:21.420> so<00:02:21.660> you<00:02:21.690> can<00:02:22.050> bend<00:02:22.290> them<00:02:22.440> out<00:02:23.810> just<00:02:24.810> like

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
sides so you can bend them out just like

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.960 
sides so you can bend them out just like
so<00:02:25.080> do<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.709> other<00:02:25.860> side<00:02:26.130> too

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.420 

once<00:02:29.970> that's<00:02:30.240> done<00:02:30.510> just<00:02:30.920> bend<00:02:31.920> them<00:02:32.100> out<00:02:32.280> to

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
once that's done just bend them out to

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.880 
once that's done just bend them out to
see<00:02:32.640> if<00:02:32.730> they<00:02:32.790> work<00:02:33.120> just<00:02:33.420> like<00:02:34.170> so<00:02:36.770> there<00:02:37.770> we

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
see if they work just like so there we

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.500 
see if they work just like so there we
go<00:02:38.330> and<00:02:39.330> just<00:02:39.630> so<00:02:39.780> you<00:02:39.960> can<00:02:40.080> see<00:02:40.260> a<00:02:40.290> better

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
go and just so you can see a better

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.170 
go and just so you can see a better
angle<00:02:42.510> here<00:02:42.960> on<00:02:43.080> this<00:02:43.260> side<00:02:43.940> this<00:02:44.940> is<00:02:45.000> the

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
angle here on this side this is the

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.210 
angle here on this side this is the
underbelly<00:02:45.959> of<00:02:46.050> whale<00:02:46.590> and<00:02:46.860> these<00:02:47.040> are<00:02:47.160> the

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
underbelly of whale and these are the

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.480 
underbelly of whale and these are the
pectoral<00:02:47.640> fins<00:02:48.320> okay<00:02:49.320> and<00:02:49.890> now<00:02:50.010> you<00:02:50.070> lift<00:02:50.340> up

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
pectoral fins okay and now you lift up

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.220 
pectoral fins okay and now you lift up
one<00:02:50.640> of<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.820> pectoral<00:02:51.240> fins<00:02:51.480> takes<00:02:51.900> it<00:02:52.050> down

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
one of the pectoral fins takes it down

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.070 
one of the pectoral fins takes it down
against<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.830> cutting<00:02:53.040> board<00:02:53.370> and<00:02:53.810> you<00:02:54.810> place

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
against the cutting board and you place

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.220 
against the cutting board and you place
your<00:02:55.230> knife<00:02:55.380> at<00:02:55.620> a<00:02:55.650> 45-degree<00:02:56.610> angle<00:02:56.640> and<00:02:57.230> then

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
your knife at a 45-degree angle and then

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.800 
your knife at a 45-degree angle and then
you<00:02:58.410> cut<00:02:58.740> through<00:02:59.580> but<00:03:00.000> not<00:03:00.270> all<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:00.720> way

make<00:04:13.700> a<00:04:13.730> cut<00:04:14.060> going<00:04:14.900> quite<00:04:15.260> deep<00:04:15.500> about<00:04:15.739> two<00:04:15.920> to

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
make a cut going quite deep about two to

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.159 
make a cut going quite deep about two to
three<00:04:16.220> centimeters<00:04:16.519> and<00:04:16.940> then<00:04:17.720> cut<00:04:18.049> the

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
three centimeters and then cut the

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:19.720 
three centimeters and then cut the
dorsal<00:04:18.590> fin<00:04:18.829> off<00:04:19.070> another<00:04:19.340> piece<00:04:19.519> of<00:04:19.549> cucumber

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730 
dorsal fin off another piece of cucumber

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.750 
dorsal fin off another piece of cucumber
just<00:04:20.630> like<00:04:20.870> so<00:04:21.109> will<00:04:21.320> do<00:04:21.470> then<00:04:22.280> you<00:04:22.400> insert

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:22.760 
just like so will do then you insert

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.640 
just like so will do then you insert
your<00:04:22.970> knife<00:04:23.150> into<00:04:23.510> the<00:04:23.690> cut<00:04:23.990> you<00:04:24.110> made<00:04:24.260> earlier

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
your knife into the cut you made earlier

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:25.690 
your knife into the cut you made earlier
and<00:04:24.800> twist<00:04:25.370> it

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
and twist it

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.220 
and twist it
making<00:04:26.090> the<00:04:26.180> cap<00:04:26.360> bigger<00:04:26.630> and<00:04:26.840> then<00:04:26.960> you<00:04:27.020> just

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
making the cap bigger and then you just

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.830 
making the cap bigger and then you just
slide<00:04:28.100> in<00:04:28.400> the<00:04:28.550> dorsal<00:04:28.940> fin<00:04:28.970> just<00:04:29.450> like<00:04:29.660> that

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
slide in the dorsal fin just like that

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.800 
slide in the dorsal fin just like that
and<00:04:30.169> as<00:04:31.010> you<00:04:31.190> release<00:04:31.430> it<00:04:31.790> tightens<00:04:32.330> around<00:04:32.630> it

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
and as you release it tightens around it

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:36.040 
and as you release it tightens around it
and<00:04:32.960> stays<00:04:33.410> perfectly<00:04:33.980> in<00:04:34.070> place<00:04:34.840> all<00:04:35.840> right

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
and stays perfectly in place all right

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.930 
and stays perfectly in place all right
so<00:04:36.169> now<00:04:36.290> you<00:04:36.350> take<00:04:36.620> a<00:04:36.680> block<00:04:37.010> of<00:04:37.160> cucumber<00:04:37.760> and

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
so now you take a block of cucumber and

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.270 
so now you take a block of cucumber and
cut<00:04:38.480> into<00:04:38.690> it<00:04:38.960> a<00:04:39.080> simple<00:04:39.470> whale<00:04:39.680> tail<00:04:40.010> design

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
cut into it a simple whale tail design

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.940 
cut into it a simple whale tail design
you<00:04:41.150> want<00:04:41.330> to<00:04:41.450> go<00:04:41.540> about<00:04:41.810> one<00:04:42.110> centimeter<00:04:42.350> deep

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
you want to go about one centimeter deep

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.850 
you want to go about one centimeter deep
that's<00:04:43.280> 2/5<00:04:43.760> of<00:04:43.940> an<00:04:44.060> inch<00:04:44.240> and<00:04:44.530> design<00:04:45.530> you<00:04:45.710> can

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
that's 2/5 of an inch and design you can

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.440 
that's 2/5 of an inch and design you can
check<00:04:46.010> it<00:04:46.100> out<00:04:46.250> top<00:04:46.550> left<00:04:46.790> for<00:04:47.000> your<00:04:47.120> screen

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:47.450 
check it out top left for your screen

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.480 
check it out top left for your screen
right<00:04:47.660> now<00:04:47.840> or<00:04:48.139> else<00:04:48.650> just<00:04:48.830> look<00:04:49.100> what<00:04:49.400> I'm

doing right here alright once you're

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.460 
doing right here alright once you're
done<00:04:51.470> tracing<00:04:51.950> out<00:04:52.280> the<00:04:52.310> whale's<00:04:52.880> tail<00:04:53.470> what

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
done tracing out the whale's tail what

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.010 
done tracing out the whale's tail what
you<00:04:54.620> do<00:04:54.830> is<00:04:55.160> you<00:04:55.580> take<00:04:56.150> your<00:04:56.330> knife<00:04:56.540> and<00:04:56.570> you

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
you do is you take your knife and you

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:00.640 
you do is you take your knife and you
cut<00:04:57.290> two<00:04:58.160> very<00:04:58.520> shallow<00:04:58.970> cuts<00:04:59.389> at<00:04:59.660> both<00:05:00.229> tips

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
cut two very shallow cuts at both tips

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.120 
cut two very shallow cuts at both tips
of<00:05:00.889> the<00:05:01.040> whale<00:05:01.250> tails<00:05:01.690> just<00:05:02.690> like<00:05:02.990> so<00:05:03.290> and<00:05:03.500> make

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
of the whale tails just like so and make

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:05.740 
of the whale tails just like so and make
sure<00:05:04.280> you<00:05:04.400> don't<00:05:04.669> go<00:05:04.850> through<00:05:05.090> the<00:05:05.240> trace<00:05:05.540> you

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
sure you don't go through the trace you

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.500 
sure you don't go through the trace you
just<00:05:05.930> made<00:05:06.400> now<00:05:07.400> you<00:05:07.460> take<00:05:07.850> it<00:05:07.910> put<00:05:08.270> it<00:05:08.360> on<00:05:08.419> the

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:08.510 
just made now you take it put it on the

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.659 
just made now you take it put it on the
board<00:05:08.840> and<00:05:09.050> lift<00:05:09.500> up<00:05:09.740> the<00:05:09.889> tips<00:05:10.160> of<00:05:10.340> the<00:05:10.490> whale

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:10.669 
board and lift up the tips of the whale

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:13.380 
board and lift up the tips of the whale
tails<00:05:11.030> and<00:05:11.270> cut<00:05:11.870> in<00:05:12.080> at<00:05:12.380> a<00:05:12.410> 45<00:05:12.620> degree<00:05:12.919> angle

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:13.390 
tails and cut in at a 45 degree angle

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.360 
tails and cut in at a 45 degree angle
creating<00:05:14.390> a<00:05:14.479> v-shape<00:05:15.050> into<00:05:15.530> it<00:05:15.650> lifting<00:05:16.250> up

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:16.370 
creating a v-shape into it lifting up

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.270 
creating a v-shape into it lifting up
the<00:05:16.580> other<00:05:16.729> side<00:05:16.940> now<00:05:17.150> and<00:05:17.620> again<00:05:18.620> a<00:05:18.680> 45<00:05:19.160> degree

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
the other side now and again a 45 degree

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.940 
the other side now and again a 45 degree
angle<00:05:19.460> of<00:05:19.850> shape<00:05:20.180> joining<00:05:21.050> up<00:05:21.320> with<00:05:21.350> the<00:05:21.590> other

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:21.950 
angle of shape joining up with the other

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:24.520 
angle of shape joining up with the other
cut<00:05:22.280> you<00:05:22.430> just<00:05:22.580> made<00:05:22.960> creating<00:05:23.960> a<00:05:24.020> v-shape

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:24.530 
cut you just made creating a v-shape

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.790 
cut you just made creating a v-shape
into<00:05:24.979> the<00:05:25.070> cucumber<00:05:25.900> now<00:05:26.900> you<00:05:26.960> just<00:05:27.350> separate

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
into the cucumber now you just separate

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.760 
into the cucumber now you just separate
this<00:05:28.039> from<00:05:28.190> the<00:05:28.340> rest<00:05:28.520> of<00:05:28.610> the<00:05:28.700> cucumber<00:05:29.770> now

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
this from the rest of the cucumber now

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:33.490 
this from the rest of the cucumber now
you<00:05:31.280> cut<00:05:31.580> the<00:05:31.789> rest<00:05:32.030> of<00:05:32.300> the<00:05:32.450> trace<00:05:32.780> away<00:05:33.200> on

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500 
you cut the rest of the trace away on

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.850 
you cut the rest of the trace away on
both<00:05:34.220> sides<00:05:34.550> so<00:05:35.270> it<00:05:35.300> just<00:05:35.660> one<00:05:36.260> side<00:05:36.500> here<00:05:36.710> like

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 
both sides so it just one side here like

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:42.310 
both sides so it just one side here like
this<00:05:37.039> first<00:05:37.370> and<00:05:38.919> then<00:05:39.919> the<00:05:40.070> other<00:05:40.220> side<00:05:41.320> and

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:42.320 
this first and then the other side and

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.909 
this first and then the other side and
now<00:05:43.220> just<00:05:43.750> cut<00:05:44.750> off<00:05:44.900> a<00:05:44.930> little<00:05:45.229> bit<00:05:45.320> of<00:05:45.530> excess

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:45.919 
now just cut off a little bit of excess

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:48.610 
now just cut off a little bit of excess
of<00:05:46.100> that<00:05:46.250> tip<00:05:46.669> that's<00:05:47.000> on<00:05:47.240> the<00:05:47.479> back<00:05:47.690> end<00:05:47.960> but

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620 
of that tip that's on the back end but

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.290 
of that tip that's on the back end but
not<00:05:48.830> too<00:05:49.010> much<00:05:49.190> because<00:05:49.430> you<00:05:49.669> need<00:05:49.850> some<00:05:50.060> of<00:05:50.150> it

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:50.300 
not too much because you need some of it

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.120 
not too much because you need some of it
so<00:05:50.479> it<00:05:50.600> stays<00:05:50.930> upright<00:05:51.169> once<00:05:51.620> you<00:05:51.740> create<00:05:52.039> the

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:52.130 
so it stays upright once you create the

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:55.000 
so it stays upright once you create the
base<00:05:52.310> now<00:05:53.270> just<00:05:53.570> place<00:05:53.810> it<00:05:53.840> how<00:05:54.590> you<00:05:54.650> want<00:05:54.979> it

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.010 
base now just place it how you want it

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:58.450 
base now just place it how you want it
to<00:05:55.070> stand<00:05:55.400> and<00:05:55.610> cut<00:05:56.800> horizontally<00:05:57.800> with<00:05:58.100> board

00:05:58.450 --> 00:05:58.460 
to stand and cut horizontally with board

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.240 
to stand and cut horizontally with board
create<00:05:59.300> the<00:05:59.390> base<00:05:59.600> so<00:06:00.229> it<00:06:00.350> stands<00:06:00.560> out<00:06:00.710> perfect

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:01.250 
create the base so it stands out perfect

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.490 
create the base so it stands out perfect
now<00:06:01.520> it<00:06:01.640> stand<00:06:01.910> up<00:06:02.120> now<00:06:02.870> you<00:06:02.930> can<00:06:02.990> keep<00:06:03.229> this

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:03.500 
now it stand up now you can keep this

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.460 
now it stand up now you can keep this
cucumber<00:06:04.220> whale<00:06:04.430> in<00:06:04.729> a<00:06:05.180> tub<00:06:05.750> of<00:06:05.780> water<00:06:06.110> for
