00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.070 
gonna be talking about how to approach

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.770 
gonna be talking about how to approach
your<00:00:55.070> doubles<00:00:55.550> and<00:00:55.790> your<00:00:55.940> triples<00:00:56.450> on<00:00:56.720> a

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
your doubles and your triples on a

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.010 
your doubles and your triples on a
single<00:00:57.590> bass<00:00:57.800> pedal<00:00:58.480> so<00:00:59.480> there's<00:00:59.840> basically

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
single bass pedal so there's basically

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.760 
single bass pedal so there's basically
five<00:01:00.610> exercises<00:01:01.629> very<00:01:02.629> very<00:01:02.930> simple<00:01:03.379> that<00:01:03.739> I

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:03.770 
five exercises very very simple that I

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.250 
five exercises very very simple that I
use<00:01:04.220> or<00:01:04.520> have<00:01:04.760> been<00:01:04.940> using<00:01:05.180> over<00:01:05.930> the<00:01:06.020> past

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
use or have been using over the past

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.460 
use or have been using over the past
several<00:01:06.500> years<00:01:06.619> to<00:01:07.070> help<00:01:07.220> me<00:01:07.550> develop<00:01:08.470> the

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
several years to help me develop the

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.219 
several years to help me develop the
doubles<00:01:09.860> and<00:01:09.979> triples<00:01:10.810> just<00:01:11.810> on<00:01:11.960> my<00:01:12.050> right

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
doubles and triples just on my right

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:17.770 
doubles and triples just on my right
foot<00:01:12.440> so<00:01:13.930> I<00:01:14.930> think<00:01:15.320> a<00:01:15.560> lot<00:01:15.710> of<00:01:15.890> times<00:01:16.780> drummers

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
foot so I think a lot of times drummers

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.760 
foot so I think a lot of times drummers
have<00:01:17.990> trouble<00:01:19.060> with<00:01:20.060> this<00:01:20.360> because<00:01:20.770> they

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
have trouble with this because they

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.820 
have trouble with this because they
don't<00:01:22.100> cover<00:01:22.700> all<00:01:23.119> of<00:01:23.180> the<00:01:23.780> different

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
don't cover all of the different

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.680 
don't cover all of the different
partials<00:01:24.830> when<00:01:25.580> they<00:01:25.759> are<00:01:25.910> practicing

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
partials when they are practicing

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.230 
partials when they are practicing
doubles<00:01:27.320> and<00:01:27.590> triples<00:01:28.100> on<00:01:28.580> the<00:01:28.729> on<00:01:28.940> the<00:01:29.060> bass

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
doubles and triples on the on the bass

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.639 
doubles and triples on the on the bass
drum<00:01:29.270> so<00:01:30.140> what<00:01:30.410> I<00:01:30.440> mean<00:01:30.680> by<00:01:30.890> that<00:01:30.920> is<00:01:32.440> in<00:01:33.440> a

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:33.649 
drum so what I mean by that is in a

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:38.260 
drum so what I mean by that is in a
groove<00:01:33.979> in<00:01:34.250> a<00:01:34.820> group<00:01:35.030> setting<00:01:35.330> a<00:01:36.220> double<00:01:37.270> that

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
groove in a group setting a double that

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.660 
groove in a group setting a double that
starts<00:01:38.720> on<00:01:38.840> one<00:01:39.200> E<00:01:39.470> is<00:01:39.680> going<00:01:40.310> to<00:01:40.430> feel

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
starts on one E is going to feel

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.149 
starts on one E is going to feel
slightly<00:01:41.210> different<00:01:41.810> than<00:01:42.380> a<00:01:42.440> double<00:01:42.979> that

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
slightly different than a double that

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:50.680 
slightly different than a double that
starts<00:01:43.670> on<00:01:43.940> E<00:01:44.830> and<00:01:45.830> or<00:01:46.750> anda<00:01:47.750> or<00:01:48.049> a<00:01:48.979> one<00:01:49.630> okay<00:01:50.630> so

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
starts on E and or anda or a one okay so

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.060 
starts on E and or anda or a one okay so
in<00:01:51.049> order<00:01:51.380> to<00:01:51.560> really<00:01:52.930> develop<00:01:53.930> and<00:01:54.619> develop

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
in order to really develop and develop

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.940 
in order to really develop and develop
the<00:01:55.189> doubles<00:01:55.580> you<00:01:55.729> have<00:01:55.970> to<00:01:56.210> practice<00:01:56.840> the<00:01:57.619> the

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
the doubles you have to practice the the

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.550 
the doubles you have to practice the the
groupings<00:01:58.400> of<00:01:58.520> two<00:01:58.760> notes<00:01:59.000> on<00:01:59.810> each<00:02:00.320> different

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
groupings of two notes on each different

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.520 
groupings of two notes on each different
partial<00:02:01.040> and<00:02:01.490> the<00:02:01.700> same<00:02:01.909> thing<00:02:02.210> goes<00:02:02.930> for<00:02:02.960> the

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
partial and the same thing goes for the

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.679 
partial and the same thing goes for the
groupings<00:02:03.920> of<00:02:04.010> threes<00:02:04.340> you<00:02:04.970> have<00:02:05.090> to<00:02:05.240> practice

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
groupings of threes you have to practice

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.199 
groupings of threes you have to practice
them<00:02:05.869> starting<00:02:06.350> on<00:02:06.560> the<00:02:06.710> first<00:02:06.979> partial<00:02:07.340> the

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
them starting on the first partial the

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:10.600 
them starting on the first partial the
second<00:02:08.630> partial<00:02:09.110> so<00:02:09.350> on<00:02:09.470> and<00:02:09.619> so<00:02:09.739> forth<00:02:10.070> so

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
second partial so on and so forth so

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.390 
second partial so on and so forth so
that's<00:02:11.480> basically<00:02:12.230> what<00:02:12.590> these<00:02:13.100> five

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
that's basically what these five

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.600 
that's basically what these five
exercises<00:02:13.880> are<00:02:14.680> so<00:02:15.680> with<00:02:15.920> the<00:02:16.010> doubles<00:02:16.370> and

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
exercises are so with the doubles and

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.240 
exercises are so with the doubles and
I'll<00:02:16.880> keep<00:02:17.060> the<00:02:17.120> quarter<00:02:17.570> note<00:02:17.720> on<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:17.959> hi-hat

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
I'll keep the quarter note on the hi-hat

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.569 
I'll keep the quarter note on the hi-hat
so<00:02:19.250> you<00:02:19.310> guys<00:02:19.549> will<00:02:19.790> have<00:02:19.940> a<00:02:19.970> have<00:02:20.750> a<00:02:20.780> pulse

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:21.579 
so you guys will have a have a pulse

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:24.670 
so you guys will have a have a pulse
alright<00:02:22.579> I'll<00:02:23.480> keep<00:02:23.660> quarters<00:02:24.019> on<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.170> hi-hat

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
alright I'll keep quarters on the hi-hat

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.470 
alright I'll keep quarters on the hi-hat
and<00:02:24.890> here's<00:02:25.160> the<00:02:25.310> first<00:02:25.489> exercise<00:02:26.090> with<00:02:26.360> the

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
and here's the first exercise with the

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.910 
and here's the first exercise with the
doubles

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:42.110 

-<00:02:32.920> again<00:02:33.430> ready<00:02:33.880> and<00:02:34.240> go

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.990 

so<00:02:43.120> now<00:02:43.420> moving<00:02:43.660> to<00:02:43.930> the<00:02:44.050> second<00:02:44.470> exercise

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
so now moving to the second exercise

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.970 
so now moving to the second exercise
which<00:02:46.000> is<00:02:46.030> going<00:02:46.240> to<00:02:46.420> be<00:02:46.660> the<00:02:47.380> first<00:02:47.650> partial

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
which is going to be the first partial

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.980 
which is going to be the first partial
of<00:02:48.400> the<00:02:48.840> of<00:02:49.840> the<00:02:50.470> triple<00:02:50.860> beat<00:02:51.240> we<00:02:52.240> have<00:02:52.450> one<00:02:52.810> E

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
of the of the triple beat we have one E

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:59.930 
of the of the triple beat we have one E
and<00:02:53.020> two<00:02:53.650> E<00:02:53.680> and<00:02:53.890> three<00:02:54.460> E<00:02:54.670> and<00:02:54.850> four<00:02:55.330> E<00:02:55.570> and

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.190 

okay<00:03:00.940> then<00:03:01.120> we're<00:03:01.270> going<00:03:01.390> to<00:03:01.420> shift<00:03:01.690> that<00:03:01.780> over

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
okay then we're going to shift that over

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.430 
okay then we're going to shift that over
a<00:03:02.230> sixteenth<00:03:02.770> note<00:03:02.890> so<00:03:03.610> now<00:03:03.820> we<00:03:03.880> have<00:03:04.210> E<00:03:04.510> and<00:03:04.990> E

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
a sixteenth note so now we have E and E

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:13.680 
a sixteenth note so now we have E and E
and<00:03:05.860> E<00:03:06.340> and<00:03:06.760> E<00:03:07.300> and<00:03:12.180> okay<00:03:13.180> we're<00:03:13.330> gonna<00:03:13.420> shift

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
and E and E and okay we're gonna shift

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.780 
and E and E and okay we're gonna shift
that<00:03:13.840> over<00:03:14.170> again<00:03:14.260> so<00:03:14.890> now<00:03:15.040> we're<00:03:15.250> playing<00:03:15.460> one

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
that over again so now we're playing one

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:24.690 
that over again so now we're playing one
and<00:03:16.120> two<00:03:16.690> and<00:03:16.930> three<00:03:17.470> and<00:03:17.830> four<00:03:21.990> and<00:03:23.370> then<00:03:24.370> one

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
more time so now our pattern is 1 e 2 e

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:38.160 
more time so now our pattern is 1 e 2 e
3<00:03:28.960> E<00:03:29.470> 4<00:03:29.830> E<00:03:35.340> ok<00:03:36.340> so<00:03:36.670> those<00:03:37.330> are<00:03:37.540> the<00:03:37.660> very<00:03:37.930> very
