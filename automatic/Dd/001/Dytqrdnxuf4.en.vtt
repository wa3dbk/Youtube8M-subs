first<00:00:14.420> one<00:00:14.720> is<00:00:14.960> about<00:00:15.710> resveratrol<00:00:16.280> and<00:00:16.940> wine

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:17.450 
first one is about resveratrol and wine

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.260 
first one is about resveratrol and wine
drinking<00:00:18.080> resveratrol<00:00:18.800> is<00:00:19.400> a<00:00:19.430> polyphenol

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:20.270 
drinking resveratrol is a polyphenol

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.900 
drinking resveratrol is a polyphenol
that<00:00:20.510> is<00:00:20.660> found<00:00:20.960> in<00:00:21.260> grapes<00:00:21.560> and<00:00:22.010> red<00:00:22.279> wine<00:00:22.580> and

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
that is found in grapes and red wine and

dark chocolate famous most people love

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.109 
dark chocolate famous most people love
because<00:00:26.330> resveratrol<00:00:26.779> has<00:00:27.320> shown<00:00:27.619> both

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119 
because resveratrol has shown both

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.550 
because resveratrol has shown both
antioxidants<00:00:29.119> and<00:00:29.560> antioxidant

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
wine drinking as a way to promote health

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.459 
wine drinking as a way to promote health
and<00:00:45.969> one<00:00:46.969> book<00:00:47.210> that<00:00:47.390> I<00:00:47.420> recently<00:00:47.690> read<00:00:48.230> the

00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
and one book that I recently read the

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:50.979 
and one book that I recently read the
expert<00:00:49.309> and<00:00:49.519> I'm<00:00:49.579> using<00:00:49.820> quotes<00:00:50.480> there<00:00:50.809> to

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
expert and I'm using quotes there to

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:51.939 
expert and I'm using quotes there to
tell<00:00:51.140> you<00:00:51.230> what<00:00:51.260> I<00:00:51.379> think<00:00:51.440> of<00:00:51.620> this<00:00:51.739> person

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
tell you what I think of this person

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:53.860 
tell you what I think of this person
suggested<00:00:52.609> drinking<00:00:52.940> wine<00:00:53.120> daily<00:00:53.570> but<00:00:53.750> you

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
suggested drinking wine daily but you

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.689 
suggested drinking wine daily but you
have<00:00:54.019> to<00:00:54.170> take<00:00:54.350> resveratrol<00:00:54.739> supplements<00:00:55.250> in

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
have to take resveratrol supplements in

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:57.579 
have to take resveratrol supplements in
addition<00:00:56.059> to<00:00:56.120> that<00:00:56.300> because<00:00:56.780> you<00:00:57.019> just<00:00:57.320> can't

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:57.589 
addition to that because you just can't

00:00:57.589 --> 00:00:59.229 
addition to that because you just can't
get<00:00:57.769> enough<00:00:57.890> for<00:00:58.190> a<00:00:58.219> spirit<00:00:58.609> roll<00:00:58.789> from<00:00:59.059> one

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
get enough for a spirit roll from one

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:02.049 
get enough for a spirit roll from one
glass<00:00:59.420> of<00:00:59.749> wine<00:01:00.019> so<00:01:01.010> the<00:01:01.309> problem<00:01:01.670> is<00:01:01.789> that

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
glass of wine so the problem is that

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.060 
glass of wine so the problem is that
studies<00:01:02.660> just<00:01:02.989> have<00:01:03.230> not<00:01:03.379> shown<00:01:03.710> resveratrol

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
studies just have not shown resveratrol

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.520 
studies just have not shown resveratrol
to<00:01:04.640> be<00:01:04.790> quite<00:01:05.120> as<00:01:05.390> beneficial<00:01:05.870> as<00:01:06.020> many

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
to be quite as beneficial as many

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.160 
to be quite as beneficial as many
