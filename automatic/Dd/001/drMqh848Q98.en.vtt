00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.879
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.670
 new video at bsp production today 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.759
 there is a test by taking the two 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:15.080
 gopro suction cups so the old and the 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.080
 be compared to new ones 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:25.279
 yes in our feast we will be on three 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:28.070
 Aspects once enter into the processing 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.670
 the functionality and the price 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.670
 performance ratio 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:35.840
 basically there is between the two 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.850
 suction cups no differences 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.950
 just maybe a few small ones 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:45.230
 but we'll look into that in more detail 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:47.660
 Functionality at the 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.670
 There are three basic functions 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.970
 Differences between the old and the 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:56.180
 new suction difference 1 is only 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:01:00.050
 times the socket or the base during the 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:03.680
 old there is still something unstable and still 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:06.259
 something does not seem too massive 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.500
 the new here already much massive 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:12.439
 succeeded and that also affects the 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.740
 stability from the second difference 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:19.040
 Here's the press and the lok 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.860
 Lift while holding the old suction cup 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.800
 all prior to the order to just 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.260
 Fasten the lever upwards 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.750
 it must be the case with the new ones 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:33.080
 that you have to push it down 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:36.229
 the advantage that the angle here 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.360
 also bring in a horizontal position 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.229
 can unfortunately what the other by 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.680
 does not go 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.920
 the third and last point is the 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.090
 honeycomb 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.880
 construction angle 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:54.570
 because the two main and 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.540
 lay one more while the older one is here 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.869
 Slightly thinner construction has 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.820
 which is not necessarily for stability 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.840
 it contributes to the new now 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:10.950
 already much more massive and that is 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.319
 the third and last point in this 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.810
 video you can now the relative 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:19.190
 small differences between the two 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.190
 recognize suction cups 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.510
 Finally one can say that the 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.910
 of course, what the new doblo sucker 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.920
 ask the stability As much 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.920
 better is in the price performance ratio 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:41.250
 Of course, the old one has his nose in the front 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.530
 Therefore our recommendation if not 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.709
 he is not used that often and so too 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:50.280
 speeds below 230 km / h 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:53.400
 the old sauknapp if you action 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.320
 richer then we would you 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.840
 therefore recommend the newer but 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.840
 is constructed much more stable and 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.120
 also used beyond the 230 km h 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.220
 can be 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.560
 yes if you liked the video then 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.959
 give us thumbs up and 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.970
 subscribe us for more videos here 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.010
 on the left, it is now ours 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.400
 last two videos once the gopro 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.170
 Mount on bike or mountain bike and 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.920
 once again on the car where we too 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.269
 use suction cups and below you can 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.440
 you like on our facebook page 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:29.750
 drop by 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.750
 we'll say goodbye until next time
