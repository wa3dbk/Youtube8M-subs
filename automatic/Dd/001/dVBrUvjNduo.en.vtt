00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.929 
second set does any of your confidence
yeah<00:01:33.869> last<00:01:34.829> year<00:01:34.950> was<00:01:35.040> very<00:01:35.369> close<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.850> then

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
yeah last year was very close and then

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.880 
yeah last year was very close and then
all<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.150> sudden<00:01:36.180> it<00:01:36.450> was<00:01:36.509> very<00:01:36.750> far<00:01:36.990> away<00:01:37.079> and

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
all of a sudden it was very far away and

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.950 
all of a sudden it was very far away and
yeah<00:01:38.700> that's<00:01:38.909> certainly<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.210> position<00:01:39.869> I'd

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
yeah that's certainly a position I'd

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.149 
yeah that's certainly a position I'd
like<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.229> try<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.470> get<00:01:40.560> in<00:01:40.710> again<00:01:40.829> and

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
like to try and get in again and

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.740 
like to try and get in again and
hopefully<00:01:41.369> this<00:01:41.670> time<00:01:41.850> if<00:01:42.060> I<00:01:42.150> do<00:01:42.210> get<00:01:42.509> in<00:01:42.630> that

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
hopefully this time if I do get in that

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.780 
hopefully this time if I do get in that
position<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:43.259> won't<00:01:43.979> fall<00:01:44.189> away<00:01:44.340> so<00:01:44.490> quickly

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
position I won't fall away so quickly

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.139 
position I won't fall away so quickly
but<00:01:45.680> yeah<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:46.710> do<00:01:47.310> feel<00:01:47.520> like<00:01:47.640> I'm<00:01:47.790> playing<00:01:47.880> well

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
but yeah I do feel like I'm playing well

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.819 
but yeah I do feel like I'm playing well

here<00:02:00.840> is<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:01.110> something<00:02:01.530> that<00:02:01.560> you're<00:02:01.920> aware

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
here is that something that you're aware

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.819 
here is that something that you're aware
of<00:02:02.670> in<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.090> sense<00:02:03.329> that<00:02:03.450> if<00:02:04.170> it's<00:02:04.409> cold<00:02:04.649> and

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
of in the sense that if it's cold and

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.050 
of in the sense that if it's cold and
damp<00:02:05.040> you<00:02:05.250> feel<00:02:05.430> like<00:02:05.579> you<00:02:05.670> might<00:02:05.790> have<00:02:05.850> to

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
damp you feel like you might have to

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.819 
damp you feel like you might have to
work<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.390> little<00:02:06.540> bit<00:02:06.719> harder<00:02:07.110> with<00:02:07.290> your<00:02:07.530> game

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
work a little bit harder with your game

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.979 
work a little bit harder with your game
style<00:02:08.250> in<00:02:08.550> Paris<00:02:08.910> yeah<00:02:09.300> i<00:02:09.330> mean<00:02:09.750> the

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
style in Paris yeah i mean the

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.380 
style in Paris yeah i mean the
conditions<00:02:10.440> can<00:02:10.619> change<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:11.220> lot<00:02:11.910> here<00:02:12.150> day<00:02:12.330> to

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
conditions can change a lot here day to

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.220 
conditions can change a lot here day to
day<00:02:12.660> and

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
day and

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.600 
day and
when<00:02:13.379> they<00:02:13.500> do<00:02:13.560> change<00:02:13.920> from<00:02:14.159> being<00:02:14.280> you<00:02:14.489> know

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
when they do change from being you know

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.030 
when they do change from being you know
like<00:02:15.000> this<00:02:15.239> to<00:02:15.569> being<00:02:16.140> a<00:02:16.260> bit<00:02:16.440> drizzly<00:02:16.830> and<00:02:16.950> you

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
like this to being a bit drizzly and you

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.990 
like this to being a bit drizzly and you
keep<00:02:17.159> playing<00:02:17.489> it<00:02:17.760> it's<00:02:18.269> a<00:02:18.810> lot<00:02:19.200> harder<00:02:19.349> work

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
keep playing it it's a lot harder work

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.460 
keep playing it it's a lot harder work
so<00:02:21.000> if<00:02:21.540> it<00:02:21.629> stays<00:02:21.840> like<00:02:21.870> this<00:02:21.989> and<00:02:22.319> I'll<00:02:22.379> be

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
so if it stays like this and I'll be

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.110 
so if it stays like this and I'll be
very<00:02:22.680> happy<00:02:22.709> and<00:02:23.099> it<00:02:23.220> makes<00:02:23.250> life<00:02:23.909> a<00:02:24.000> little

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
very happy and it makes life a little

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.270 
very happy and it makes life a little
bit<00:02:24.299> easier<00:02:24.480> for<00:02:24.690> me<00:02:24.930> to<00:02:24.959> use<00:02:25.319> the<00:02:25.680> parts<00:02:26.099> of<00:02:26.159> my

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
bit easier for me to use the parts of my

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.170 
bit easier for me to use the parts of my
game<00:02:26.310> that<00:02:26.959> you<00:02:27.959> know<00:02:28.080> can<00:02:28.260> can<00:02:29.060> trouble<00:02:30.060> my

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
game that you know can can trouble my

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.699 
game that you know can can trouble my
opponents<00:02:30.720> I<00:02:30.810> don't<00:02:30.989> have<00:02:31.140> to<00:02:31.260> you<00:02:31.530> know<00:02:31.650> try

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
opponents I don't have to you know try

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.789 
opponents I don't have to you know try
so<00:02:32.099> hard<00:02:32.129> to<00:02:32.610> do<00:02:33.090> that<00:02:33.269> stuff<00:02:33.420> so<00:02:33.780> it's<00:02:33.989> um<00:02:34.260> it's

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
so hard to do that stuff so it's um it's

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:35.930 
so hard to do that stuff so it's um it's
one<00:02:35.129> of<00:02:35.220> those<00:02:35.280> things<00:02:35.340> you've<00:02:35.670> got<00:02:35.730> to<00:02:35.790> be

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
one of those things you've got to be

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.550 
one of those things you've got to be
ready<00:02:36.060> for<00:02:36.180> anything<00:02:36.330> here<00:02:36.840> but<00:02:37.019> if<00:02:37.170> it<00:02:37.290> can<00:02:37.440> be

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
ready for anything here but if it can be

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.289 
ready for anything here but if it can be
like<00:02:37.709> this<00:02:37.890> and<00:02:38.160> obviously<00:02:38.220> I'd<00:02:38.640> probably

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
like this and obviously I'd probably

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.900 
like this and obviously I'd probably
much<00:02:39.569> prefer
