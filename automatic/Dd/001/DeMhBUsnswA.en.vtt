area<00:05:00.910> to<00:05:01.240> map<00:05:01.390> i<00:05:01.570> will<00:05:01.840> keep<00:05:02.080> paging<00:05:02.380> through

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
area to map i will keep paging through

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.260 
area to map i will keep paging through
as<00:05:02.860> you<00:05:02.950> can<00:05:03.070> see<00:05:03.190> i<00:05:03.220> cross<00:05:03.850> the<00:05:04.000> threshold

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
as you can see i cross the threshold

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.050 
as you can see i cross the threshold
there<00:05:04.720> and<00:05:04.870> i'm<00:05:05.280> continuing<00:05:06.280> to<00:05:06.370> explore<00:05:06.760> at

there and i'm continuing to explore at

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:08.790 
there and i'm continuing to explore at
the<00:05:07.690> farther<00:05:07.990> out<00:05:08.020> you<00:05:08.170> go<00:05:08.470> from<00:05:08.650> your

the farther out you go from your
starting<00:05:09.100> nest<00:05:09.340> that<00:05:10.410> the<00:05:11.410> creatures<00:05:11.890> will

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.010 
starting nest that the creatures will

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:14.280 
starting nest that the creatures will
become<00:05:12.220> more<00:05:12.430> and<00:05:12.490> more<00:05:12.640> difficult<00:05:12.880> now<00:05:13.390> very

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:14.290 
become more and more difficult now very

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:15.870 
become more and more difficult now very
quickly<00:05:14.530> the<00:05:15.040> ones<00:05:15.220> that<00:05:15.340> i<00:05:15.400> killed<00:05:15.460> were

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
quickly the ones that i killed were

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.090 
quickly the ones that i killed were
pretty<00:05:16.210> easy<00:05:16.420> now<00:05:16.690> let<00:05:17.320> me<00:05:17.410> cover<00:05:17.860> some

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.100 
pretty easy now let me cover some

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:20.490 
pretty easy now let me cover some
distance<00:05:18.400> here<00:05:18.460> and<00:05:18.960> see<00:05:19.960> the<00:05:20.110> world<00:05:20.260> is<00:05:20.470> very
