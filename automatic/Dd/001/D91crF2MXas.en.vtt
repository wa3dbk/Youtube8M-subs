00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:09.010
 to be given then it must be specified 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.820
 that the cord is not donated 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:14.019
 umbilical 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:16.330
 but the blood that remains inside the 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:19.960
 cord and placenta 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:23.250
 immediately after birth this blood e 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:25.660
 rich in stem cells that they are 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:30.039
 very important for the treatment of 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:35.109
 some pathologies they are affected with both 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:37.749

00:00:37.749 --> 00:00:45.389
 heterologous ie the blood collected e 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:49.049
 inside the umbilical cord comes 

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:53.079
 kept in public banks 

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:56.589
 free of charge and made available to 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:01:00.670

 instead the allogeneic donation in which i 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:08.649
 parents and at their own expense decide to 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:11.500
 to conserve the cord blood of the 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:14.530
 own child and who will be put to 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.409
 available only to parents and 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:20.229
 child in case of future pathologies 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:22.929
 this blood is preserved 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:25.560
 within private banks 

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:30.000
 I repeat at the expense 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:34.680
 of parents who are abroad in 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.399
 particular is what happens at the moment 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.250
 of hospitalization in the delivery room 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:44.869
 the couple must sign a consent 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:49.220
 Informed pre procedure and 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:52.979
 fill in a medical history questionnaire 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.880
 very important to detect factors of 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.750
 exclusion 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.539
 after that at the time of delivery 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:04.409
 the midwife after cutting the cord 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:08.489
 umbilical is entrusted the newborn to 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:12.120
 maternal care will make the withdrawal of the 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:14.900
 blood remained inside the cord 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.920
 through a kit 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:22.319
 Specifically it should be emphasized that 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:26.250
 this procedure is absolutely 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:29.700
 painless, non-invasive but above all not 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.599
 it is harmful neither to the child nor to the child 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.349
 mum 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:37.819
 in fact this blood would be disposed of 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:41.269
 then after giving birth e 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:44.909
 the midwife must promote this 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:48.689
 this procedure is a procedure 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:51.540
 risk free but above all rich in 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:55.069
 benefits for the people who need them 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.069
 of blood donation
