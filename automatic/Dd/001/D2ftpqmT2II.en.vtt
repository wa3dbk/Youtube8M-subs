00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:07.359
 i greet jürgen klopp and jupp 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:10.000
 heynckes jürgen klop it was very very 

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:13.930
 how close do you have the 90 minutes here 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.810
 he lives yes i have had more here 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:20.470
 fun but that is not so important 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:23.189
 but we have an average 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:27.939
 first half played and one 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.829
 much better second half at the 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.659
 first too little problems 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:34.360
 who thinks I have been much more possible 

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:37.870
 as the second hinted bavaria 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.460
 make the gate that she is one of the 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.220
 first has certainly been better 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.360
 but that would not be a problem 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.730
 so on and we would have to have 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.000
 the second half we were then in 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:51.730
 the still very intense game 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.320
 Then the more active team 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.610
 you have to say that the big chance and 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.430
 the greatest chance still have you 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:00.040
 but we were still clear 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:03.640
 the backlog was better in the game 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:07.030
 do not catch up and that's something you have to say 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:09.159
 with 45 minutes normal in football is a 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.820
 a little hard to do in Munich 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:15.670
 and that's why we are today for today 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.110
 the deserved loser around just here 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.060
 accordingly, munich munich jupp 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.130
 heynckes course to move into the 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.170
 semifinal 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.810
 but it does not seem that way today 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.100
 I would have made the feeling wide 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.450
 should be easy for the next ten years 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.990
 Send points from the beginning 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.270
 but we saw that we were with 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.870
 good moments also bavaria munich 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.040
 can cause problems and therefore 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:42.600
 are a bit too after this game 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.600
 smarter but still eliminated 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.610
 ask to them redirected 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.619
 how important was the game how important 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.110
 the result progressing into 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:56.369
 semifinal 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:59.439
 think that both teams ins 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.659
 wanted to enter the semi-final and that has 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:04.979
 yes, also in the very intense game 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:08.069
 both teams seen today 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:11.770
 We have the first half 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:14.200
 had opportunities but ours 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.260
 best time safely 15 minutes before 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.700
 halftime break where we have more security 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.819
 pass security in our player where 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.520
 we also played forward more courageously 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:27.849
 We also have to worry about her from the pressing 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:30.400
 am able to liberate and must say that 

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:34.750
 it was already correct that the borussia 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:37.000
 after the break has good moments because in 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:40.620
 the forward movement and took it too 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.870
 yes so halfway had two chances 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.360
 but I think that if you are like that 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.870
 the all chances in the second 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.250
 half-time adds that we play 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:56.200
 deserved to have won 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:59.640
 It is at a level where you are not 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:03.640
 may make crucial mistakes and 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:07.690
 have to say that my team also 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:10.870
 has demonstrated that we are at the moment 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.730
 not only beautiful beautiful attractive 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.980
 can play football but that too 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.989
 In the right moments we fight 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.140
 can also exist against teams 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.879
 the acting aggressively have the 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.250
 in this season in freiburg in 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:26.980
 Mainz also in wolfsburg always the 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.450
 and that is for sure 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.670
 development that took the team 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.709
 and that's why I have to be honest 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.709
 his big compliment to my troupe 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:40.000
 that we won the game here today 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:43.780
 against a good opponent and 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.730
 that yes we are now into the semi final 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.340
 of course, ambitions have come 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:51.750
 to come to Berlin but have the 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.750
 other three teams too
