00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:09.220
 good afternoon to all what the water does 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:13.180
 this never 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:16.500
 I recently acquired the system from 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:21.790
 named that is this is a smaller version 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:26.169
 someone is not a code like this 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:29.710
 all business frame boa she just came out 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:32.439
 height here, I already launched uterus here 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:37.180
 it comes here last year's 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:40.000
 karnik prayazyk 1075 installed it here 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:44.110
 secured finally nku limit set to three 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
 of the day smeared with hundreds of honey all sotik chock 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.820
 they cleaned him up and i am now 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:54.370
 I let the uterus in and a puppy next they already 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:56.250
 built and poured honey here in contrast 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.480
 from nick so thirty two cells 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.900
 back rat back case here 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:03.280
 missing completely kind of like 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.720
 manufacturers say no to me 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.900
 necessary because there is no 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:13.570
 exit uterus on the back of a look 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.909
 I will try to take into account to prevent their mistakes 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.470
 that other people already had 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.210
 told others how it is 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.850
 was happening how to get rid of errors 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.440
 we will act in general today 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.990
 went from something tomorrow i need her 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:30.910
 in the morning you are already 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.180
 Today it is already 4 16 hours, as they say 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.790
 and 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:38.730
 half a dozen missing it here we'll see 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.730
 tomorrow morning I will be like this . 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.690
 put in the middle of the nest next to 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.690
 open brood 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.330
 no longer naked 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.330
 hooks 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:19.310
 Well, the end means the second day in the new 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.500
 honeycomb uterus 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.920
 of course I had to wait 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.920
 long 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.710
 the first day she set aside 7 pieces from 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:34.530
 the end of the second she shone all and not even 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:38.430
 one egg now on the advice of experienced 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:41.370
 I will transfer all these maggots 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.230
 eggs rather soon move in the holder and 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.390
 I will close the cells for two and a half days 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.160
 so that the bees do not throw them out 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.840
 Now comes the trick you are abundant they can 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.960
 in throwing up like this 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:56.910
 taking away 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:03:00.950
 hands do not touch the balls when 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:04.340
 he made bowls with his hands even wax 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:07.280
 touched the edge of the bowl 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.270
 the bees threw out the next day 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:13.320
 larvae of such pans 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:16.160
 and here it is good not to touch 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.160
 absolutely 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:30.200
 sorry for shaking the tripod camera 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.200
 not 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:37.890
 rather there is a professional tripod 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.890
 daughter uses it 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:46.730
 earns and we are so in the background 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:04.390
 very comfortable everything is technologically 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:04.390
 true 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:20.260
 now i 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:25.630
 in a row take all the egg bowls they 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:29.070
 everywhere there and then after two and a half 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:31.690
 day we will sort which is better 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.660
 rather not two and a half three when 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:40.350
 the bees will already accept them which ones will 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:40.350
 there was already going to throw extra 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:53.599
 but 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:10.660
 in some cells do not know here 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:10.660
 see you can see no then 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:17.620
 here here 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:25.280
 double wonders will choose what suits them 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:30.260
 I am a supporter of such cases 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:35.540
 somehow and now we dress cells lidochki 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:40.070
 dress these loops a little closer to 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:42.640
 center so that the book does not cling to 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.640
 framework 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.200
 for neighboring 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:57.160
 certainly bad that cell power at all 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.160
 15 pieces 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.490
 like this 

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:18.100
 I put the body in the usual way 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:20.510
 closer to 1 part of the fetus where warmer 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:23.390
 to make eggs ripe 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:23.840
 they got the larvae no longer top 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:27.290
 body 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:27.860
 and in the middle, well, almost under the top 

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:30.550
 brood 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.550
 put 

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:38.580
 like this 

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:51.599
 prosperity and eggs that do not fit 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:54.620
 me on vaccination strips in the same 

00:06:51.599 --> 00:06:59.879
 sotik and I will return back to the family 

00:06:54.620 --> 00:07:02.699
 where it all was open also for that 

00:06:59.879 --> 00:07:05.539
 same place I will return and you can cook 

00:07:02.699 --> 00:07:05.539
 well 

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:36.020
 Well, let's see what happens next now 

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:36.020
 in two and a half days we will
