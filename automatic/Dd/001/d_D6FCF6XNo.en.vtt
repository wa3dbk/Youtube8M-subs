 Alexey Nemova 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.050
 it was hard to believe but whirlwinds 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:46.030

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:53.309
 of independence 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:56.050
 but lay up for the time well, as that's 10 years 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.030
 remembered me congratulated there someone and 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.100
 then reminded but in principle there is no 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.910
 Forget it is not so forgotten 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:07.450
 it seems to be remembered all the time therefore 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.010
 such not to forget after this triumph 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.659
 Latvian delegation from summer 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.820
 olympic games without medals home not 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.979
 the author of that first returned 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.030
 victories decided to pass on their experience to children and 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:18.030
 founded gymnastic school 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:27.870
 and the group where in Karaganda 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:30.930
 it is wildly hard volume work but to me 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:33.210
 I like working with children 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.700
 and I like to see that kids 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.550
 The question is not developed that they are not 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:43.610
 I will be a champion will not be that he 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.610
 came he does not know how and he learned 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:51.280
 we also read that you did not want 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:55.240
 first take gymnastics is it 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:58.930
 still nonsense or not really 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:02.380
 it was now going back to those times 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.060
 And to this , another difference is that I am not 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.700
 wanted to take it because i was fat 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:11.080
 gymnastics for the life I was not in the 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:14.320
 time it was not 7 somewhere 85 year was 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:17.530
 tough selection but sports 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.390
 not able not talented did not take on 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.240
 chose exactly looked at parents 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.430
 looked at the structure of the body on the genes and yes 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.950
 then understood this to this sport 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.770
 fits me not picked me led 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.410
 parents instilled in parents and trainer 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.450
 looked not too fat us on and 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.670
 one coach refused me took another 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.530
 coach Alexander Patrushev who's 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.740
 was mine when the trainer started there 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:44.080
 twelve years looking for a new come let 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.760
 i would have to plow like me with 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.620
 the first day since i was the weakest 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.290
 did not know how to pull out 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.060
 Yes, and I had to work hard to the full 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.250
 program and those who came 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.920
 everything worked out the first time and not through 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.110
 three years when it started very difficult 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.610
 elements at first for their impossible simply 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.770
 do not you can just double somersault 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.080
 jump still have a long time to work that 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:10.260
 it turned down 1 time it did not work 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:12.730
 they all fail to warrior and finish 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:18.400
 The first time I spoke points this world not 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:20.220
 was 19 years old and at that time I was offered 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.250
 national team of belarus 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:26.410
 move for them and speak 13 but they have 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.530
 were there already 2 times world champion there 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.570
 stars and so on and I kind of understood 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.700
 that I will still be a foreigner all 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.220
 pondered and refused despite the fact that 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:40.450
 the chances there to win a medal were much 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:45.600
 more I refused and how is the story 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.600
 showed that no wonder that no wonder on 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:53.569
 well done yourself now come to 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:59.450
 shells fit when a child needs 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:04:02.989
 hold many ask this question for now 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:06.290
 desire did not appear because much 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:08.540
 I gave time and effort and I am fine 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.489
 I understand that what I have already done on 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.580
 olympiad and what difficult years i already 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:14.390
 never make a girl better than you 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.030
 tilt 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.430
 all - let's shag a lot of time 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.590
 must pass to these children which us 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:23.690
 come little gone in these kinds 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.690
 sports and began to develop and then 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.889

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.490
 Andrey Dmitriyev to norms with thirsty 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:30.490
