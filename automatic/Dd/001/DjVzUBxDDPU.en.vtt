00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.750
 series of tutorials is the second video of 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:26.920
 age series says the first was about the 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:30.580
 sync media mixer with the ball 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:33.579
 earth and 8 in this tutorial talk a little 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.920
 about upgrading your equipment 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:43.090
 this tutorial is very similar to a 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:45.070
 update of the 920 a bit old and 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.420
 in this video I will show you how to update the 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.180
 cj 2000 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.820
 nexus is a procedure is practically the 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:56.100
 even though there maybe those who did not see will 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:58.629
 learn how to do it but it's important 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.820
 you have the panel equipment always 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.289
 you are entering the wall page 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.050
 dot com 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:06.550
 there is water support where at that time you 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.640
 will count the list of all 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:11.760
 public equipment had in the straw and 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.230
 everything has usb input 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.180
 you probably already have an update and 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:19.659
 with this you will only get improvements in 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:22.060
 considerably improved equipment 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:26.549
 especially in the part of qantas is that 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:29.409
 is the twisting synchronism j with unix and 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:32.229
 so it's worth you always searching 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:36.220
 and always takes issue where is your 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:38.140
