00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.560
 e 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:15.600
 hello to all and welcome to the 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.980
 xv number 10 days for this show 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.330
 we will be interested in a 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.830
 console that has established itself in 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.900
 many homes while attracting 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.700
 lightning gamers and yet the wii 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.060
 she has a lot of games 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.980
 quality 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.750
 certainly she also has a lot of 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.040
 so-called casual or children's games 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.960
 but that does not mean that you have to 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.250
 deny the excellence of other titles and 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.690
 besides, like every console 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.880
 she also has hidden pearls 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.660
 let's go to the discovery of three 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.609
 nuggets of the wii debt writing is 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.840
 a beat them all singular instead of 

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:43.800
 put you in charge of the wine that 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.600
 tap on everything that moves 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.370
 you will control here a spider and a 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.660
 scorpion strange choice but who 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.949
 works wonderfully 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.539
 just the first level doing 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:52.679
 tutorial office with the spider you 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.489
 will give you an account of the 

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:55.320
 wealth of the game 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.000
 besides the difficulty in raising the title 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.160
 many collectibles are to find 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.570
 in the form of larvae and if the beginning of the 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.739
 game places you in tunnels this 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.839
 arrival outside that you 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.250
 understand the immensity of the task because 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:06.600
 here you can walk on the walls 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.340
 or even swing you from canvas to 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.290
 canvas with the spider in the manner of a 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.030
 spider man but if the exploration side 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.010
 only serves to unlock art works and 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.780
 other bonuses it is well and truly the fight 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.980
 who gets the upper hand in the game and there you have to 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.600
 recognize that the developers have 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.860
 makes all the critters present 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.420
 in the game or benefited from a care 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.010
 extreme in their animation 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.170
 so that chaining the shots becomes 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.250
 a real treat the two protagonists of the 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.660
 game obviously have not the same 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.280
 gameplay is the spider can jump 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.120
 dodge and she reveals herself far more 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.980
 agile that she looks 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.660
 the scorpion is a real time 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.460
 that on legs and will protect himself with his 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.420
 pliers waiting to be able to place 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.190
 devastating blows 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.510
 the clashes against the bosses are 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.770
 often punctuated by ass phases 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.780
 earthy as can be seen in the 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.890
 games god of war for example strangely 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.630
 we could have expected from such a title 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.800
 that he does not have a scenario and that 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.270
 we are content with hunting and 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.650
 critters throughout the game if the 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.060
 second part of this statement is 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.890
 true the first is completely 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.730
 oddly wrong a scenario is beautiful 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.200
 and well present 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.640
 tell at the beginning of the game and distilled 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.080
 in the game you will cross the road of 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.670
 wine who go about their business 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.200
 a weird narration choice but who 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.670
 works because the player is going 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.200
 naturally stop by itself 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.210
 progression to listen to what's going on 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.840
 even if the scenario does not shine by its 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.550
 complexity 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.660
 the intelligence of staging at the 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.670
 through the eyes of our creatures 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.260
 mortals is to be welcomed for the rest we 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.819
 is faced with a wii game using 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.980
 fully the capabilities of the wiimote 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.270
 and the technical aspect of which is 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.930
 good side of the average productions 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.099
 of the console the life of the game 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.780
 correct if we finish the game online 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.549
 right but becomes quite high if we 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.079
 try to finish it at 100% of eads 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:27.640
 writing is probably not done 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:29.170
 to please everyone especially if 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.700
 we consider its support but it 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.260
 is a very good surprise for 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.819
 anyone looking for originality 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.620
 only regret the absence of any fashion 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.269
 multiplayer the game being really carved 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.650
 for a solo experience whatever it is 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:39.879
 if you find it did not look for a 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.349
 reseller or flea market 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:43.540
 you will know now that the game is worth 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:45.969
 largely the shot to be tried fragile 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.560
 farewell dreams ruins of the moon is a 

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:49.599
 title developed by the creators of 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.980
 baten kaitos and eternal sonata 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:52.720
 while all the players were expecting 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.370
 to find a beast rpg tri-crescendo 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.349
 surprised them by proposing a title 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.000
 fundamentally different here 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.829
 exploration and lyricism are in the spotlight 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.930
 in a post apocalyptic world where 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:03.489
 humanity seems to have disappeared this 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.989
 water a 15 year old boy leaves to the 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.889
 search for other survivors after the 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.000
 death of his grandfather 

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:08.769
 of course there will be clashes 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.269
 against ghosts who will not want him 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.980
 good but unlike the others 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.689
 studio games they are here in time 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.560
 real and is not at all 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:16.060
 strong point of the title 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.560
 to be honest, there is some 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.060
 heaviness in handling the character 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.919
 it does not really fit the fight 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.519
 but let's go because the interest of the game lies 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:23.079
 elsewhere 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:24.489
 let's start with the beauty of 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:26.500
 environments that are rich in 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.519
 details fragile dreams is one of the most 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.870
 beautiful games from the wii as much 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.120
 artistically than technically 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.889
 and do not trust it, it's not because 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.840
 that the game is eyeing towards cel-shading and 

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:35.859
 the Japanese animation that they target a 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.970
 young audience 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:39.129
 the many dialogues and situations 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.530
 are often sad and will bring 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:42.579
 sometimes uneasiness in the player 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.079
 besides another interest of the game and its 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:45.579
 narration that's all will often find 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:47.439
 memories belonging to others 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:48.400
 individuals or families in the 

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:50.079
 places they cross 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.549
 their stories are often endearing 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:53.709
 and the player will always strive to reunite 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:55.419
 the most of these elements and although very 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.370
 quickly accompanied the feeling of loneliness 

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:59.229
 will never leave this water and this is where 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.549
 the whole subject of the fragile dreams game is 

00:03:59.229 --> 00:04:02.560
 carrying a very critical message 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:04.569
 towards the present society although being 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.370
 surrounded would not we be always a 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:08.259
 little alone and without wanting to spoil you 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.489
 the entire scenario is because 

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:11.139
 of those issues that the fragile world 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:13.479
 dreams is plunged into chaos 

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:15.220
 gone completely unnoticed on its way out 

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:17.530
 surely because of other headline 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.419
 of March 2010 fragile dreams is 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:21.519
 a real invitation to travel and 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.560
 more survival horror exploration than 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.150
 rpg it's a journey that will not be able 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.220
 leave you marble especially if you 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.500
 loop the adventure a game that will give birth 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:30.670
 a lot of emotion in the person who is 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.710
 will leave 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:34.330
 let's leave a little it's my fai of horror 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.820
 to find ourselves in a world rather 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:39.940
 cute klonoa on wii and the remake of 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:42.220
 klonoa door to phantomile released in 1998 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.450
 on playstation useless to search the 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:45.640
 improvements in this version 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.950
 they are almost solely aesthetic 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.260
 already very beautiful on playstation klonoa 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:52.180
 becomes sublime on wii klonoa being a 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.040
 platform game in 2 5d enjoying 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.480
 festivities depth the passage to the 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.800
 nintendo console can display 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.390
 much richer backgrounds and 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.530
 much more worked but klonoa 

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.450
 it is above all an original gameplay 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.430
 thanks to a ring he wears in 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.900
 klonoa can attract him 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.260
 enemies lift them above his 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.120
 head 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.800
 and from there he can balloons 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.690
 it's in the direction he wants 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.100
 to the screen or to the bottom what 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.170
 brings some nice passages 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.390
 launched the enemies down for a 

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:18.430
 sou allows to perform a double jump this 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:20.050
 which will prove crucial to master 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.190
 plus some enemies once caught 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.690
 allow to make movements 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:24.100
 special for example from the beginning of 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.570
 the adventurer grabbed a round enemy 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.830
 possessing deliciousness on the head 

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:28.480
 will fly away for a few 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.080
 time exceeding the height of a jump 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.400
 usual 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.380
 klonoa can also hover a few 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.210
 seconds beating his ears 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.590
 like rayman yes that's the other great 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.630
 strength of this remake is the dubbing 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:39.190
 integral which he enjoys with us there 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.750
 is possible to enjoy the game in vf 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.250
 a vf that seems to have been 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.610
 recorded for the youngest ones 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:43.810
 players 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.370
 but for those who know the 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:47.140
 playstation version that they reassure themselves 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.430
 it is always possible to choose the 

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.500
 original dubbing which is a language 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.610
 invented for the game nevertheless in this 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.960
 klonoa version is a lot less 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.370
 expressive than in the original version 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.200
 where they kept pushing 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.060
 exclamations at the level of the duration of 

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.170
 klonoa life on wii is the exact replica 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.600
 the playstation version 

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:03.070
 no more no less that means the 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.960
 player will have to cross 12 beautiful 

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:06.400
 world level design excellent on 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.630
 regret the lack of news 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.560
 especially as the game may end 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:10.150
 quite easily 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.380
 I will not go back to the scenario that 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:12.910
 is mainly an excuse to go 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.530
 different levels his childish side 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:16.360
 but especially as a singer gets closer to 

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:18.130
 the napl tail we had 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.790
 talked about in our second issue 10 

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.500
 of our games 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:22.210
 despite all this game is a real 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.650
 wonder on every level the most 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:24.940
 young people will feel at home while 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.620
 the older ones will be able to dive 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:27.040
 time of an afternoon which should 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.600
 delight 

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.010
 even if the lifetime is by 

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.330
 weak the assets of the game are 

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:32.650
 largely sufficient to pass 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.750
 good times to fans of games 

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:36.910
 platform in all this Christmas is a 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:38.800
 more than obvious choice this issue of Eden 

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:40.450
 games is coming to an end the wii has 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.840
 certainly not shown all that his 

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:43.160
 toy library hid us 

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:44.840
 we reserve you other of its 

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.430
 nuggets for an upcoming issue in 

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:48.199
 waiting do not hesitate to subscribe to 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:48.949
