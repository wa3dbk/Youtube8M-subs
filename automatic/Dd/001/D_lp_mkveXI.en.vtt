00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.290 

this<00:00:51.579> is<00:00:51.789> a<00:00:51.899> Microsoft<00:00:52.899> Live<00:00:53.230> Chat<00:00:53.559> LX<00:00:54.300> 3000

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
this is a Microsoft Live Chat LX 3000

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.979 
this is a Microsoft Live Chat LX 3000
and<00:00:56.969> one<00:00:57.969> of<00:00:58.059> the<00:00:58.179> first<00:00:58.420> things<00:00:58.659> that<00:00:58.719> you'll

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
and one of the first things that you'll

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.130 
and one of the first things that you'll
notice<00:00:59.320> about<00:00:59.500> this<00:00:59.769> is<00:01:00.010> it<00:01:00.280> as<00:01:00.429> a<00:01:00.460> digital<00:01:01.269> USB

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
notice about this is it as a digital USB

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.959 
notice about this is it as a digital USB
for<00:01:02.500> superior<00:01:03.129> clarity

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:03.969 
for superior clarity

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:05.940 
for superior clarity
and<00:01:04.059> so<00:01:04.570> what<00:01:04.750> that<00:01:04.780> means<00:01:04.930> is<00:01:05.379> that<00:01:05.409> you<00:01:05.770> don't

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
and so what that means is that you don't

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.870 
and so what that means is that you don't
have<00:01:06.220> separate<00:01:07.049> Jack's<00:01:08.049> for<00:01:08.560> the<00:01:08.890> microphone

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
have separate Jack's for the microphone

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.570 
have separate Jack's for the microphone
and<00:01:09.909> Freaker<00:01:10.500> speakers<00:01:11.500> so<00:01:12.130> it's<00:01:12.399> just

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
and Freaker speakers so it's just

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.340 
and Freaker speakers so it's just
digital<00:01:12.820> plug-and-play<00:01:13.330> and<00:01:14.049> you're<00:01:14.170> ready
