color tank I think it's a very very nice
like<00:01:15.469> a<00:01:15.499> neo<00:01:15.859> chrome<00:01:16.189> rainbow<00:01:16.639> tint<00:01:16.939> to<00:01:17.090> it

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.319 

it's<00:01:20.990> got<00:01:21.170> bolts<00:01:21.590> on<00:01:21.770> like<00:01:22.009> one<00:01:22.369> bolt<00:01:22.819> that

bolts from different sides

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:26.469 
bolts from different sides
yes<00:01:24.619> so<00:01:24.799> you<00:01:24.920> have<00:01:24.950> to<00:01:25.159> make<00:01:25.310> sure<00:01:25.490> you<00:01:25.670> turn

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
yes so you have to make sure you turn

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.469 
yes so you have to make sure you turn
them<00:01:26.630> evilly<00:01:27.049> evenly<00:01:27.859> us<00:01:28.009> and<00:01:28.369> then<00:01:29.119> we<00:01:29.299> go<00:01:29.420> to

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
them evilly evenly us and then we go to

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.749 
them evilly evenly us and then we go to
the<00:01:29.719> epic<00:01:29.929> nine<00:01:30.170> urbanite<00:01:30.889> headset<00:01:31.310> it's

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
the epic nine urbanite headset it's

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.870 
the epic nine urbanite headset it's
integrated<00:01:33.520> I'd<00:01:34.520> say<00:01:34.729> this<00:01:35.270> is<00:01:35.329> like<00:01:35.630> the<00:01:36.319> most

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
integrated I'd say this is like the most

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.620 
integrated I'd say this is like the most
improved<00:01:37.880> thing<00:01:38.090> like<00:01:39.079> the<00:01:39.409> thing<00:01:39.590> that's

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
improved thing like the thing that's

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.429 
improved thing like the thing that's
most<00:01:41.630> used<00:01:42.079> is<00:01:42.319> always<00:01:43.130> spinning<00:01:44.079> very<00:01:45.079> yeah

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
most used is always spinning very yeah

most used is always spinning very yeah
sure<00:01:45.859> how<00:01:46.459> fast<00:01:46.759> it<00:01:46.969> spins<00:01:51.069> makes<00:01:52.069> no<00:01:52.340> noise<00:01:52.520> at

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 
sure how fast it spins makes no noise at

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:53.840 
sure how fast it spins makes no noise at
all
