so<00:01:49.299> far<00:01:49.479> the<00:01:49.630> test<00:01:49.840> is<00:01:49.990> actually<00:01:50.320> going<00:01:50.439> pretty

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
so far the test is actually going pretty

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.469 
so far the test is actually going pretty
good<00:01:50.979> got<00:01:51.549> to<00:01:51.580> say<00:01:51.789> I'm<00:01:51.909> actually<00:01:52.149> really

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
good got to say I'm actually really

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:55.669 
good got to say I'm actually really
liking<00:01:52.960> the<00:01:53.080> adjustability<00:01:53.740> of<00:01:54.009> the<00:01:54.580> Sam<00:01:55.030> tree

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:55.679 
liking the adjustability of the Sam tree

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:59.969 
liking the adjustability of the Sam tree
go<00:01:56.679> stick<00:01:56.950> and<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:58.869> know<00:01:58.990> there's<00:01:59.770> a<00:01:59.829> lot<00:01:59.860> of

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
go stick and you know there's a lot of

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:01.889 
go stick and you know there's a lot of
drag<00:02:00.460> though<00:02:00.909> what<00:02:01.360> if<00:02:01.479> you're<00:02:01.689> thinking

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:01.899 
drag though what if you're thinking

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:03.029 
drag though what if you're thinking
about<00:02:02.079> sticking<00:02:02.380> it<00:02:02.590> out<00:02:02.649> your<00:02:02.829> car<00:02:03.009> window

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:03.039 
about sticking it out your car window

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:05.569 
about sticking it out your car window
you<00:02:03.729> probably<00:02:03.939> notice<00:02:04.270> that<00:02:04.450> with<00:02:04.600> that<00:02:04.780> with

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
you probably notice that with that with

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.859 
you probably notice that with that with
the<00:02:06.579> pole<00:02:06.759> swivel<00:02:07.149> owner<00:02:07.360> around<00:02:07.509> everything

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
the pole swivel owner around everything

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.460 
the pole swivel owner around everything
got<00:02:08.500> to<00:02:08.709> about<00:02:08.860> 70<00:02:09.369> and<00:02:10.209> a<00:02:10.539> little<00:02:10.959> hard<00:02:11.230> to

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
got to about 70 and a little hard to

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.170 
got to about 70 and a little hard to
hold<00:02:11.590> on<00:02:11.830> to<00:02:12.040> at<00:02:12.250> that<00:02:12.370> point<00:02:13.019> and<00:02:14.019> quite<00:02:15.180> cops

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
hold on to at that point and quite cops

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.850 
hold on to at that point and quite cops
probably<00:02:16.360> wouldn't<00:02:16.690> like<00:02:16.720> you<00:02:16.870> to<00:02:16.930> see<00:02:17.530> me<00:02:17.709> but

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
probably wouldn't like you to see me but

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.759 
probably wouldn't like you to see me but
whatever<00:02:18.480> some<00:02:19.480> more<00:02:19.630> tests<00:02:19.989> going<00:02:20.140> on<00:02:20.380> have<00:02:20.680> a

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
whatever some more tests going on have a

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.309 
whatever some more tests going on have a
head<00:02:21.010> down<00:02:21.130> to<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.310> marina<00:02:21.519> here<00:02:22.090> and<00:02:22.319> which

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
head down to the marina here and which

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.309 
head down to the marina here and which
is<00:02:23.560> uh<00:02:23.970> we'd<00:02:24.970> spin<00:02:25.180> this<00:02:25.360> way<00:02:25.599> there's

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
is uh we'd spin this way there's

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.050 
is uh we'd spin this way there's
directly<00:02:26.769> to<00:02:26.860> my<00:02:26.950> back<00:02:27.220> and<00:02:27.790> we're<00:02:27.910> going<00:02:28.030> to

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
directly to my back and we're going to

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.059 
directly to my back and we're going to
go<00:02:28.209> down<00:02:28.390> there<00:02:28.599> and<00:02:28.739> I'm<00:02:29.739> gonna<00:02:29.860> shove<00:02:30.010> this

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
go down there and I'm gonna shove this

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:31.559 
go down there and I'm gonna shove this
thing<00:02:30.220> in<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:30.459> water<00:02:30.670> and<00:02:30.940> see<00:02:31.120> what<00:02:31.239> happens

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
thing in the water and see what happens

00:02:31.569 --> 00:03:11.980 
thing in the water and see what happens
to<00:02:31.750> it

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:17.000 

so<00:03:12.990> I'm<00:03:13.080> not<00:03:13.200> quite<00:03:13.500> sure<00:03:13.530> that<00:03:15.200> s<00:03:16.200> one<00:03:16.710> likes

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
so I'm not quite sure that s one likes

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.100 
so I'm not quite sure that s one likes
going<00:03:17.190> in<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:17.490> water<00:03:17.700> it<00:03:18.600> filled<00:03:18.810> up<00:03:18.900> pretty

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
going in the water it filled up pretty

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.010 
going in the water it filled up pretty
quick<00:03:19.380> but<00:03:20.220> didn't<00:03:21.180> notice<00:03:21.450> it<00:03:21.600> was<00:03:21.780> fairly

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
quick but didn't notice it was fairly

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.490 
quick but didn't notice it was fairly
stable<00:03:22.380> I<00:03:22.800> hope<00:03:23.550> the<00:03:23.730> stick<00:03:24.000> down<00:03:24.240> comes<00:03:25.110> apart

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
stable I hope the stick down comes apart

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.530 
stable I hope the stick down comes apart
easy<00:03:25.830> and<00:03:26.370> then<00:03:26.760> just<00:03:26.910> drain<00:03:27.090> the<00:03:27.210> water<00:03:27.360> out

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
think it should be dry I mean this I

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:12.330 
think it should be dry I mean this I
think<00:04:11.170> as<00:04:11.260> long<00:04:11.379> as<00:04:11.530> you<00:04:11.620> do<00:04:11.739> that<00:04:11.769> to<00:04:12.099> anything

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
think as long as you do that to anything

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.890 
think as long as you do that to anything
that<00:04:12.549> you<00:04:12.730> put<00:04:12.760> in<00:04:13.000> salt<00:04:13.239> water<00:04:13.299> I<00:04:13.569> mean<00:04:13.750> it's<00:04:13.870> a

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
that you put in salt water I mean it's a

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.620 
that you put in salt water I mean it's a
good<00:04:14.080> idea<00:04:14.230> I<00:04:14.860> mean<00:04:15.700> just<00:04:15.730> to<00:04:16.000> take<00:04:16.209> it<00:04:16.299> apart

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
good idea I mean just to take it apart

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.900 
good idea I mean just to take it apart
rinse<00:04:17.049> it<00:04:17.260> some<00:04:17.470> fresh<00:04:17.680> water<00:04:17.859> I<00:04:18.430> mean<00:04:18.790> that

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
rinse it some fresh water I mean that

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.960

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
way reduce corrosion anyways I think I

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.610
