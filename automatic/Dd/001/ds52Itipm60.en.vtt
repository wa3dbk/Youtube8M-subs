00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.100
 Hi everyone, alright, thanks for being 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.809
 watching this video 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.780
 in this video here I'll show you more 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.150
 a way of moving the camera together 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.699
 with the object not we seen panic 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.340
 which is to generate the camera on the camera axis 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.310
 that on the horizon the panoramic view 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.769
 to fix an object and the scenario in the 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.470
 background are moving nef 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.689
 a race for example we already 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.140
 also saw the uncle had here that is 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.120
 raise the camera that on the lateral axis of 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.670
 up from bottom to top or 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.310
 move the camera so some other 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.860
 way you can go to the camera in 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:46.620
 relation to the object also so that some 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.140
 thing just stand on the image and the background 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.110
 the whole scenario keep spinning behind 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.600
 there are many ways to do this 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.610
 and in this class today I will show more 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.120
 another form which is also not exactly 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:03.420
 only one way nor is it always moving the 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.000
 photographic camera in a ratio equal to 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.009
 object is a person the element of the 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.680
 composition that we are going to want 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:13.560
 be stopped in the scene that kind of 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.020
 movement is called inertial movement 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.910
 because the agent is inside a car 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.430
 on the move for example, right? 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:23.159
 I did some photos of mine here I did 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.200
 here on the house ladder here were the 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.330
 and here it did not work very well. 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.970
 that I've been trying and been trying to 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.050
 I left the camera here with half a second of 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.600
 velocity 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.909
 I closed the diaphragm and left a judgment 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.970
 down right inac ces in each bit 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.890
 dark and here the various right the wrong in 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.830
 I started here because the 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:47.340
 certain is that I have I'm half stopped 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:50.190
 ladder size swinging here and 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.520
 But it was so good here, it was everything 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.920
 half stopped and here is also what was left 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.350
 half a second or something 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.830
 so it 's yours and others I do not 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.680
 I got here, this team was a 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:06.900
 those who almost stopped and the 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.509
 background was very swaying and I 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.190
 just I took the camera craned 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.620
 just as if you were doing a self 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.689
 and leaving a low speed and tried 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.470
 do not shake the camera so it is not easy 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:20.380
 leave as firm as possible 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.140
 here on the arm and take a photo of me giving 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.820
 neither I nor I just grabbed the ladder 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.970
 How are you watching a video here? 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:32.500
 only the one that was almost 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:35.380
 background time swaying and here I went 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.350
 singing and some of them until you 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:43.380
 make him have done 50 photos here 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:46.840
 or maybe another one got good 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:50.500
 What you can use is three more here. 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.810
 You can use the rest, it got bad here. 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.150
 because the speed was too low and 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.520
 It is difficult to hold the camera without 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.500
 to balance it mainly 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.040
 descending a ladder that rocks a lot 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.010
 huh 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:06.430
 the one that has almost stopped here right? 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:09.580
 these streets as less as 3,000 than my 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:13.180
 in some it even works out here later 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:16.870
 I'm going to come up and come in the middle of the clothesline to cnet 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:18.670
 a clothes line and some hanging clothes 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.250
 so I started doing it here in the middle of 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:24.220
 man worked here also that was 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:28.150
 half a second also of speed 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.980
 Some of them shook me a lot, right? 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:35.310
 here is this one will stay a little bit 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.310
 more correct but only a little 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:41.870
 here a little bit here will stay 

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:44.079
 better this one did not stop but stop 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.079
 and it all 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:53.180
 I threw here I was looking at the screen 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.180
 here it already gave more or less 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:00.990
 and here was the nokia was much better 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:05.460
 in this one was almost stopped almost and the 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:08.280
 moving background and just hold the 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:09.930
 camera and I was walking with the camera. 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.870
 holding on to me 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:16.700
 and here I also made the bed here was 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:20.100
 falling on this in patras I just held and 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:23.640
 itombe so on the slope in bed in 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:29.730
 some of them worked out is that I 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:31.800
 I think we'll see that almost certainly 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:34.830
 to stay with the strongest arm that 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:41.310
 was a little more quick stop is this 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:45.890
 here is also this one, stay put 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:49.220
 almost cool here too 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:49.220
 here too 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:53.720
 It's legal here too. 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:05:01.320
 and here too 

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:03.390
 This one was good too. 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.420
 It's because of these photos that we can come 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:08.430
 in which photography the possibilities 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:11.220
 that we can have with them are 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:14.580
 really or infinite or close to the 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:16.440
 infinite right, because we just have to create 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.740
 something even if it is a 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:22.740
 madness the camera there 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.770
 Can you interpret our madness? 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:27.540
 nor the way we're thinking 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:30.660
 or our ideas or not to call 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:34.650
 of madness but the camera I 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:36.870
 knowing how to touch it only by understanding how it is 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:39.060
 what works and what are the 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:41.490
 possibilities it offers 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:44.010
 that these possibilities are very 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:47.160
 not so great to invent everything in 

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:49.260
 I can reproduce this in the 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:52.020
 camera even though sometimes 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:55.020
 need to produce something but always 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:57.000
 is it possible for us to make the 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:59.100
 corresponding chamber as well as the 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.840
 People are thinking about people with this 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:03.540
 It's crazy that we can have a 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:07.080
 photography we can do with 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:09.600
 she play without need to use the 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:12.570
 post-production he nor the manipulation the 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:15.990
 photoshop nor do the assembly anything nor 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:18.990
 make the picture look pretty cool 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:21.990
 very well composed with a very 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:24.390
 cool simply by taking a photo 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:26.610
 photographically without address 

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:28.410
 more to the photograph later or nothing at all 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:30.240
 this is one more movement of the 

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:32.820
 which is a simple movement of 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:35.520
 do and when we can sign 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:38.250
 well, the arm firmly 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:40.770
 relation to the camera in us for example 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:42.330
 in this self I made a photo already 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:44.730
 It looks more beautiful, right? 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:46.860
 and also in other type shapes within 

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:50.880
 car on top of trucks on top of 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:53.220
 trains and even body movements with 

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:56.400
 movement of the camera together is not 

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:59.310
 movement and I monitor the movement 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:01.290
 in front of some animal, for example. 

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:02.210
 without using the zoom is that everything is being 

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:05.930
 using 

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:07.039
 and fixed using only the lens at speed 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:09.169
 low 

00:07:07.039 --> 00:07:11.780
 the movement of the camera and this 

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:14.150
 monitoring of the chamber in relation to 

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:16.460
 The object that we want to photograph is 

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:19.610
 to be still and that kind of 

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:21.800
 movement in the photo it leaves the 

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:23.810
 photo is busy with the 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:26.810
 move then do not stay that thing 

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:30.080
 static in the picture and is one more option 

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:32.810
 to take photographs that are 

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:35.690
 good and you can see that it is not attractive 

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:38.479
 as soon as the public sees you feel good 

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:41.750
 with the photograph or feel excited 

00:07:38.479 --> 00:07:43.340
 and feel somewhat altered to 

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:46.220
 that she remembers that photograph in the 

00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:48.470
 future and for this depends on our 

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:50.479
 and our doing so that 's it folks 

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:52.789
 thank you tissues and video until of a 

00:07:50.479 --> 00:07:54.169
 ex you liked share favorite
