00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
using when I'm under the bench press at

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.850 
using when I'm under the bench press at
least<00:01:15.460> right<00:01:15.640> now<00:01:15.670> anyway<00:01:16.410> it<00:01:17.410> still<00:01:17.650> works

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
least right now anyway it still works

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.070 
least right now anyway it still works
the<00:01:18.100> the<00:01:18.430> mid<00:01:18.610> test<00:01:18.910> you<00:01:19.090> know<00:01:19.240> if<00:01:19.720> you<00:01:19.900> make

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
the the mid test you know if you make

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.260 
the the mid test you know if you make
sure<00:01:20.229> that<00:01:20.410> you<00:01:20.530> get<00:01:20.650> the<00:01:20.800> bar<00:01:21.520> in<00:01:21.820> the<00:01:22.090> right

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
sure that you get the bar in the right

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:32.060 
sure that you get the bar in the right
position<00:01:22.860> so<00:01:23.860> that's<00:01:24.520> what<00:01:24.729> I'm<00:01:24.820> working<00:01:25.030> on

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.620

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.410 
inches above it and that is the usual
area<00:01:41.920> I<00:01:41.980> get<00:01:42.310> stuck<00:01:42.550> on<00:01:42.670> the<00:01:42.790> bench<00:01:43.000> press<00:01:43.180> when

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
area I get stuck on the bench press when

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.270 
area I get stuck on the bench press when
I'm<00:01:43.540> going<00:01:43.720> heavy<00:01:43.990> so<00:01:44.260> this<00:01:44.950> is<00:01:45.070> good<00:01:45.250> practice

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
first set was with 365 and this is the

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.600 
first set was with 365 and this is the

here<00:03:00.430> on<00:03:00.459> this<00:03:00.700> set<00:03:00.970> here<00:03:01.300> I<00:03:02.050> couldn't<00:03:03.010> get<00:03:03.130> it

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
here on this set here I couldn't get it

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.190 
here on this set here I couldn't get it
up<00:03:03.310> while<00:03:03.580> I<00:03:03.760> try<00:03:03.970> it<00:03:04.030> twice<00:03:04.209> but<00:03:04.570> I<00:03:04.600> failed<00:03:05.050> on

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
up while I try it twice but I failed on

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.500 
up while I try it twice but I failed on
both<00:03:05.230> attempts<00:03:05.739> on<00:03:05.940> actually<00:03:06.940> lifting<00:03:07.390> this

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
both attempts on actually lifting this

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.330 
both attempts on actually lifting this
way<00:03:07.720> to<00:03:07.780> just<00:03:08.140> shift<00:03:08.320> it<00:03:08.530> around<00:03:08.650> on<00:03:09.010> the<00:03:09.130> bar

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
way to just shift it around on the bar

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.370 
way to just shift it around on the bar
but<00:03:09.970> on<00:03:10.090> the<00:03:10.180> third<00:03:10.209> attempt<00:03:10.660> ask<00:03:10.840> you<00:03:11.019> got<00:03:11.200> it

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
but on the third attempt ask you got it

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.250 
but on the third attempt ask you got it
that's<00:03:11.620> because<00:03:11.830> i<00:03:11.860> took<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.250> times<00:03:12.489> actually

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
that's because i took the times actually

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.900 
that's because i took the times actually
zero<00:03:14.260> everything<00:03:14.650> out<00:03:14.890> you<00:03:15.489> know<00:03:15.610> get<00:03:15.790> my

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
zero everything out you know get my

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.850 
zero everything out you know get my
tunnel<00:03:16.239> vision<00:03:16.570> and<00:03:16.750> then<00:03:17.320> I<00:03:17.470> was<00:03:17.560> able<00:03:17.709> to

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
tunnel vision and then I was able to

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.190 
tunnel vision and then I was able to
actually<00:03:18.040> press<00:03:18.370> the<00:03:18.489> weight<00:03:18.720> now<00:03:19.720> granted<00:03:20.050> is

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
actually press the weight now granted is

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.870 
actually press the weight now granted is
a<00:03:20.230> lot<00:03:20.530> harder<00:03:20.739> to<00:03:21.040> press<00:03:21.489> from<00:03:21.700> this

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
a lot harder to press from this

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.090 
a lot harder to press from this
particular<00:03:22.030> point<00:03:22.510> I'm<00:03:22.959> pressing<00:03:23.440> right<00:03:23.860> at

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
particular point I'm pressing right at

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.490 
particular point I'm pressing right at
my<00:03:24.220> sticking<00:03:24.580> point<00:03:24.850> you<00:03:25.630> know<00:03:25.810> so<00:03:26.019> it<00:03:26.170> takes<00:03:26.320> a

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
my sticking point you know so it takes a

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.729 
my sticking point you know so it takes a
lot<00:03:26.799> of<00:03:26.910> recruitment<00:03:27.959> I'm<00:03:28.959> upper<00:03:29.230> body<00:03:29.440> tax

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:29.739 
lot of recruitment I'm upper body tax

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.770 
lot of recruitment I'm upper body tax

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
stepping the weight up this is actually

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.040 
stepping the weight up this is actually
the<00:03:51.160> last<00:03:51.340> set<00:03:51.730> of<00:03:51.760> chest<00:03:52.270> and<00:03:54.510> doing<00:03:55.510> them<00:03:55.630> one
