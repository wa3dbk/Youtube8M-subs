00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 Hi, I am Stas Davydov today, December 13 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.109
 Friday and I think it's a great day to 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.280
 inform you that youtube has tightened 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.309
 license terms 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.929
 content and this games are music and even 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.610
 some videos that we review 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.320
 if the copyright holder is a shit 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.390
 they are rarely no shit amit 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.250
 make us claims even if we 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.500
 right legit okay first video 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:37.469
 sent as a crasher and it's about talking 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:47.850
 boat to pro boat saying not die 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:50.399
 can that punt 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.260
 but think it is a boat Ashworth 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.969
 can bite the dock and hold your mouth 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:01:02.280
 I would not be surprised if she swims in my 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:03.600
 thrust actually such videos are dangerous 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.519
 that they are imperceptible to themselves 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.350
 view 50 times in a row here tell me 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.960
 I was furious with what the boat was doing 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.960
 sick bbb then already what a drug addict 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.070
 by the way this boat itself is 760 thousand 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.909
 views on yes yes yes yes yes yes cola and 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.920
 that's good here one sent a video about that 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.040
 how a dump truck itself loads its trunks 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.040
 of trees 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.110
 but we decided that a lot cooler video 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.740
 which sent a swift with 1 pro helicopter 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.740
 who loads Christmas trees 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.990
 ohh santa are you already with your album 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.630
 you trust helicopters see eared 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.189
 moron even on this drift hell now 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.229
 we wanted to put a video under the theme of 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:05.299
 Tokyo drift but as I said at the beginning 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.679
 copyright holders can slay us 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:17.959
 so have to use my 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:19.010
 vocal cover damn this dude too 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:20.750
 cool for the trees 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.160
 it's as if a professional cook with 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.080
 some of their top three 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.650
 cook and educations virtuoso 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.580
 cooked hot dogs you know oh well 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.640
 let's somehow make it clear 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.410
 to all viewers itâ€™s about fat 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.030
 smeared with mayonnaise room to practice 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.470
 shuttle runs while holding 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.470
 comp on which you play dota 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.980
 this is exactly the dude who is the battlefield 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:54.099
 and already has time to take all the helicopters 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.260
 you choose who to play for and that's good 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:59.060
 the third video sent a donut and i don't 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.060
 because again for something then I think 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:05.090
 for that as if yes but nonetheless I 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.400
 I'm going to win I'm not myself 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.629
 something i still think that some 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.780
 It could be something 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:13.549
 but still i'm going to win 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.099
 this fiery speech of Julia 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:17.629
 golubovoy which goes for the victory better 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:21.590
 would shoot vidosiki as burp seriously 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:23.870
 i'm going to win i'm on it i'm in myself if 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:27.680
 something i still think that some 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.250
 maybe something but anyway i'm going for 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.370
 victory 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.590
 girls are different but some are very 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:45.739
 the dumb noticed a striking resemblance 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:47.629
 of this video with the first of the release here 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:48.620
 somehow so any look to me 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:51.290
 economic news 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.799
 but for Julia, most likely any 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.230
 news 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:56.449
 I am not myself in myself, is I something 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:04:01.810
 Equally I think that some may be 

00:03:56.449 --> 00:04:01.810
 something but still i'm going to win 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:10.310
 well ok of course i envy her 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.420
 beautiful because I myself have turned 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:14.700
 smart girl well done 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.609
 in its 15 years passed all sorts of contests 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:22.079
 I got all the titles I hope that they 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:24.090
 there for the victory handed books on it all
