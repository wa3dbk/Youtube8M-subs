a lot of people don't know how to

a lot of people don't know how to
stretch<00:00:31.199> out<00:00:31.439> for<00:00:31.470> splits<00:00:32.009> like<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.180> correct

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
stretch out for splits like the correct

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.959 
stretch out for splits like the correct
sway<00:00:33.809> a<00:00:34.020> lot<00:00:34.260> of<00:00:34.380> people<00:00:34.530> just<00:00:34.710> go<00:00:35.219> into<00:00:35.610> it<00:00:35.790> and

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
sway a lot of people just go into it and

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.299 
sway a lot of people just go into it and
if<00:00:36.660> you<00:00:36.780> just<00:00:37.020> go<00:00:37.140> into<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.559> really<00:00:37.710> fast<00:00:38.010> you

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
if you just go into it really fast you

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.060 
if you just go into it really fast you
can<00:00:38.460> sprain<00:00:38.760> something<00:00:39.059> or<00:00:39.649> pull<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.860> muscle

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
can sprain something or pull a muscle

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.090 
can sprain something or pull a muscle
and<00:00:41.520> eventually<00:00:42.270> it'll<00:00:42.420> hurt<00:00:42.719> really<00:00:42.930> bad<00:00:43.230> so

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
and eventually it'll hurt really bad so

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.770 
and eventually it'll hurt really bad so
you'll<00:00:44.579> have<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:44.969> longer<00:00:45.210> time<00:00:45.450> doing<00:00:45.690> the

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
you'll have a longer time doing the

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.369 
you'll have a longer time doing the
splits<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.320> it<00:00:46.530> will<00:00:46.649> take<00:00:47.399> more<00:00:47.579> work<00:00:47.809> so<00:00:48.809> the

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
splits and it will take more work so the

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.010 
splits and it will take more work so the
correct<00:00:49.829> way<00:00:50.160> there<00:00:50.579> is<00:00:50.789> at<00:00:51.239> least<00:00:51.270> I<00:00:51.930> think

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
correct way there is at least I think

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.290 
correct way there is at least I think
two<00:00:52.680> or<00:00:52.829> three<00:00:53.010> ways<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.370> actually<00:00:53.520> do<00:00:53.879> splits

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
two or three ways to actually do splits

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.410 
two or three ways to actually do splits
for<00:00:54.629> stretches<00:00:55.079> one<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.640> have<00:00:56.789> either<00:00:57.000> feet

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
for stretches one is to have either feet

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:04.549 
for stretches one is to have either feet
like<00:00:58.109> you<00:00:58.320> like<00:00:58.829> this<00:01:02.870> you<00:01:03.870> have<00:01:04.049> either<00:01:04.229> your

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
like you like this you have either your

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.320 
like you like this you have either your
right<00:01:04.769> leg<00:01:05.070> or<00:01:05.549> your<00:01:05.610> left<00:01:05.939> leg<00:01:06.119> on<00:01:06.299> the

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
right leg or your left leg on the

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.649 
right leg or your left leg on the
outside<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.430> you<00:01:08.430> just<00:01:08.640> put<00:01:08.909> your<00:01:09.000> foot<00:01:09.270> make

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
like that or like that and then you just

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.420 
like that or like that and then you just
want<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.460> lean<00:01:14.670> into<00:01:14.909> it<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:16.040> try<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.280> keep

your foot on the ground don't do that so

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.899 
your foot on the ground don't do that so
you<00:01:20.909> stretch<00:01:21.270> out<00:01:21.450> calf<00:01:22.229> muscle<00:01:25.580> and<00:01:26.580> then<00:01:26.729> go

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
inside of like that so it looks oh sorry

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.850 
inside of like that so it looks oh sorry
like<00:01:49.259> that<00:01:50.299> point<00:01:51.299> your<00:01:51.390> toe<00:01:51.600> well<00:01:52.350> can't<00:01:52.710> see

like that point your toe well can't see
what

00:01:56.309 --> 00:01:56.319 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:01.510 

okay<00:01:57.319> that's<00:01:57.530> all<00:01:57.740> right<00:01:58.960> wait<00:01:59.960> you<00:02:00.109> did<00:02:00.520> so

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
okay that's all right wait you did so

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.340 
okay that's all right wait you did so
because<00:02:01.939> if<00:02:02.359> you<00:02:02.509> point<00:02:02.749> your<00:02:02.869> toe<00:02:03.020> it<00:02:03.259> will

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
because if you point your toe it will

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.190 
because if you point your toe it will
help<00:02:03.560> you<00:02:04.329> stretching<00:02:05.329> out<00:02:05.569> your<00:02:05.600> legs<00:02:05.929> so

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
help you stretching out your legs so

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.740 
help you stretching out your legs so
just<00:02:06.409> like<00:02:06.530> that<00:02:06.560> you're<00:02:06.890> not<00:02:06.979> feeling<00:02:07.069> much

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
just like that you're not feeling much

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.270 
just like that you're not feeling much
then<00:02:08.750> point<00:02:09.530> it<00:02:09.819> strike<00:02:10.819> you<00:02:11.000> could<00:02:11.269> do<00:02:11.420> it<00:02:12.280> so

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
then point it strike you could do it so

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.650 
then point it strike you could do it so
I<00:02:13.580> think<00:02:13.670> that's<00:02:13.970> pretty<00:02:14.239> much<00:02:14.390> it<00:02:14.450> for

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
I think that's pretty much it for

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.360 
I think that's pretty much it for
stretches<00:02:15.140> so<00:02:15.260> there<00:02:15.440> is<00:02:15.560> actually<00:02:15.980> two<00:02:16.010> ways

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
stretches so there is actually two ways

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.880 
stretches so there is actually two ways
to<00:02:17.260> do<00:02:18.260> it<00:02:18.440> but<00:02:18.470> um<00:02:19.060> yes<00:02:20.060> so<00:02:20.750> once<00:02:20.959> you<00:02:21.110> feel

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
to do it but um yes so once you feel

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.320 
to do it but um yes so once you feel
comfortable<00:02:21.920> and<00:02:22.519> you<00:02:22.549> don't<00:02:22.790> feel<00:02:23.030> the

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
comfortable and you don't feel the

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.530 
comfortable and you don't feel the
aching<00:02:24.160> feeling<00:02:25.160> in<00:02:25.519> your<00:02:25.640> legs<00:02:25.700> that<00:02:26.299> means

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
aching feeling in your legs that means

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.970 
aching feeling in your legs that means
you've<00:02:26.690> pretty<00:02:26.900> much<00:02:26.989> stretched<00:02:27.440> everything

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
you've pretty much stretched everything

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.460 
you've pretty much stretched everything
out<00:02:28.129> and<00:02:28.480> most<00:02:29.480> likely<00:02:29.660> you<00:02:29.959> will<00:02:30.019> not<00:02:30.079> spray

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
out and most likely you will not spray

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.880 
out and most likely you will not spray
in<00:02:30.560> a<00:02:30.620> pole<00:02:30.799> muscle<00:02:31.220> so<00:02:31.760> um<00:02:32.620> sprain<00:02:33.620> how<00:02:33.739> can

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
in a pole muscle so um sprain how can

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.500 
in a pole muscle so um sprain how can
you<00:02:33.980> spray<00:02:34.160> the<00:02:34.220> muscle<00:02:34.519> you<00:02:34.970> will<00:02:35.090> not<00:02:35.239> pull<00:02:35.480> a

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
you spray the muscle you will not pull a

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.600 
you spray the muscle you will not pull a
muscle<00:02:35.750> or<00:02:36.170> strain<00:02:36.860> your<00:02:37.010> ankle<00:02:37.370> or<00:02:37.519> something

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
muscle or strain your ankle or something

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.759 
muscle or strain your ankle or something
like<00:02:37.940> that<00:02:38.000> or<00:02:38.450> injured<00:02:39.170> Nate<00:02:39.379> I<00:02:39.470> don't<00:02:39.709> know

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
like that or injured Nate I don't know

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.520 
like that or injured Nate I don't know
if<00:02:39.829> you<00:02:39.950> get<00:02:40.040> any<00:02:40.250> way<00:02:40.370> any<00:02:41.290> injuries<00:02:42.290> will

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
if you get any way any injuries will

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.289 
if you get any way any injuries will
hopefully<00:02:42.680> not<00:02:43.010> happen<00:02:43.610> since<00:02:44.120> you've

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
hopefully not happen since you've

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:47.710 
hopefully not happen since you've
strained<00:02:44.599> oh<00:02:45.819> stretch<00:02:46.819> everything<00:02:47.209> yeah<00:02:47.660> you

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
strained oh stretch everything yeah you

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.390 
strained oh stretch everything yeah you
sprained<00:02:48.140> everything<00:02:48.530> so<00:02:48.680> you<00:02:48.739> can<00:02:48.980> do<00:02:49.129> it<00:02:49.250> now

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
sprained everything so you can do it now

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.830 
sprained everything so you can do it now
um<00:02:49.940> since<00:02:50.629> you<00:02:50.840> stretched<00:02:51.200> everything<00:02:51.769> and

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
um since you stretched everything and

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.039 
um since you stretched everything and
yeah<00:02:53.840> so<00:02:54.109> is<00:02:54.260> this<00:02:54.709> is<00:02:54.890> how<00:02:55.099> you<00:02:55.160> do<00:02:55.459> s<00:02:56.049> first

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.049 
yeah so is this is how you do s first

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:01.030 
yeah so is this is how you do s first
you<00:02:57.620> just<00:02:57.859> simply<00:02:58.129> either<00:02:58.849> stand<00:02:59.150> up<00:02:59.799> one<00:03:00.799> leg

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
you just simply either stand up one leg

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.849 
you just simply either stand up one leg
bring<00:03:01.310> the<00:03:01.489> other<00:03:01.609> and<00:03:01.989> you<00:03:02.989> slowly<00:03:03.319> slide

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:03.859 
bring the other and you slowly slide

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:06.670 
bring the other and you slowly slide
down<00:03:04.450> this<00:03:05.450> as<00:03:05.660> far<00:03:05.870> as<00:03:06.049> I<00:03:06.139> can<00:03:06.200> get<00:03:06.410> miss<00:03:06.650> Kay

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
down this as far as I can get miss Kay

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.319 
down this as far as I can get miss Kay
oh<00:03:07.959> yeah<00:03:08.959> and<00:03:09.799> then<00:03:09.980> you<00:03:10.280> want<00:03:10.910> to<00:03:10.970> hold<00:03:11.150> it<00:03:11.299> for

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.329 
oh yeah and then you want to hold it for

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:14.860 
oh yeah and then you want to hold it for
maybe<00:03:11.859> five<00:03:12.859> seconds<00:03:13.430> five<00:03:13.669> to<00:03:13.940> 15<00:03:14.299> seconds<00:03:14.690> 0

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
maybe five seconds five to 15 seconds 0

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:22.000 
maybe five seconds five to 15 seconds 0
1<00:03:15.310> 2<00:03:16.310> 3<00:03:16.959> 4<00:03:19.150> you<00:03:20.150> know<00:03:20.269> so<00:03:20.720> keep<00:03:21.200> going<00:03:21.410> on<00:03:21.560> now

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
1 2 3 4 you know so keep going on now

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.190 
1 2 3 4 you know so keep going on now
you<00:03:22.849> why<00:03:23.030> wouldn't<00:03:23.389> you<00:03:23.540> don't<00:03:23.690> want<00:03:23.840> to<00:03:23.930> do<00:03:24.049> it

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
you why wouldn't you don't want to do it

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.020 
you why wouldn't you don't want to do it
until<00:03:24.319> it<00:03:24.470> doesn't<00:03:24.620> hurt<00:03:24.859> anymore<00:03:25.099> because<00:03:25.790> at

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
until it doesn't hurt anymore because at

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:27.879 
until it doesn't hurt anymore because at
first<00:03:26.209> it<00:03:26.480> will<00:03:26.660> hurt<00:03:26.989> because<00:03:27.560> you're

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:27.889 
first it will hurt because you're

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:32.020 
first it will hurt because you're
stretching<00:03:28.250> out<00:03:28.430> a<00:03:28.819> lot<00:03:29.720> more<00:03:30.549> if<00:03:31.549> it<00:03:31.819> hurts

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
stretching out a lot more if it hurts

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.819 
stretching out a lot more if it hurts
dramatically<00:03:32.989> which<00:03:33.319> it<00:03:33.470> will<00:03:33.590> at<00:03:33.799> first

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829 
dramatically which it will at first

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:35.979 
dramatically which it will at first
because<00:03:34.220> you're<00:03:34.459> not<00:03:34.549> used<00:03:34.790> to<00:03:34.910> doing<00:03:35.750> stuff

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
because you're not used to doing stuff

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:37.750 
because you're not used to doing stuff
like<00:03:36.139> that<00:03:36.260> but<00:03:36.739> if<00:03:36.859> it<00:03:36.980> hurts<00:03:37.160> so<00:03:37.340> much<00:03:37.400> where

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
like that but if it hurts so much where

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.940 
like that but if it hurts so much where
you<00:03:37.849> can't<00:03:38.030> even<00:03:38.120> get<00:03:38.359> down<00:03:38.630> did<00:03:39.380> most<00:03:39.620> likely

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
you can't even get down did most likely

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.680 
you can't even get down did most likely
you<00:03:40.069> haven't<00:03:40.370> stretched<00:03:40.669> completely<00:03:41.389> or

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
you haven't stretched completely or

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.500 
you haven't stretched completely or
you're<00:03:42.139> just<00:03:42.489> used<00:03:43.489> to<00:03:43.579> it<00:03:43.669> but<00:03:44.329> I've<00:03:44.419> been

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
you're just used to it but I've been

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.030 
you're just used to it but I've been
doing<00:03:44.720> ants<00:03:44.840> for<00:03:45.079> 10<00:03:45.230> years<00:03:45.440> so<00:03:45.590> I'm<00:03:45.709> used<00:03:45.739> to

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
doing ants for 10 years so I'm used to

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.860 
doing ants for 10 years so I'm used to
stuff<00:03:46.250> like<00:03:46.280> that<00:03:46.400> um<00:03:48.160> yeah<00:03:49.160> so<00:03:49.780> that's<00:03:50.780> how

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
stuff like that um yeah so that's how

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.440 
stuff like that um yeah so that's how
you<00:03:50.989> the<00:03:51.139> splits<00:03:51.470> and<00:03:51.709> then<00:03:52.519> after<00:03:53.329> a<00:03:53.359> while

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
you the splits and then after a while

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.629 
you the splits and then after a while
maybe<00:03:54.019> at<00:03:54.319> past<00:03:54.620> 15<00:03:55.069> you<00:03:55.190> can<00:03:55.340> start<00:03:55.519> doing

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:55.639 
maybe at past 15 you can start doing

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:57.369 
maybe at past 15 you can start doing
stretches<00:03:56.269> like<00:03:56.450> when<00:03:56.690> you're<00:03:56.840> in<00:03:56.959> the<00:03:57.109> splits

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:57.379 
stretches like when you're in the splits

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:02.490 
stretches like when you're in the splits
maybe<00:03:58.010> going<00:03:58.370> back<00:03:58.579> like<00:03:59.030> this

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:08.520 

like<00:04:03.540> that<00:04:04.540> I<00:04:05.910> looked<00:04:06.910> and<00:04:07.420> they<00:04:07.960> may<00:04:08.140> be<00:04:08.200> like

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
like that I looked and they may be like

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.970 
like that I looked and they may be like
doing<00:04:08.740> like<00:04:09.070> that<00:04:10.440> that<00:04:11.440> will<00:04:11.560> help<00:04:11.680> out<00:04:11.860> with

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
doing like that that will help out with

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:22.170 
doing like that that will help out with
your<00:04:12.160> scorpion<00:04:12.930> um<00:04:13.930> like<00:04:14.860> this<00:04:19.950> and<00:04:21.180> then

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
your scorpion um like this and then

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.230 
your scorpion um like this and then
maybe<00:04:22.450> like<00:04:22.750> stretching<00:04:23.050> like<00:04:23.290> side<00:04:23.560> to<00:04:23.800> side

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
maybe like stretching like side to side

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.990 
maybe like stretching like side to side
well<00:04:25.240> side<00:04:25.420> this<00:04:25.570> I<00:04:25.720> will<00:04:25.870> be<00:04:25.900> back<00:04:26.110> but<00:04:27.000> like

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
well side this I will be back but like

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.940 
well side this I will be back but like
that<00:04:31.110> and<00:04:32.110> now<00:04:32.320> after<00:04:32.530> you<00:04:32.950> accomplished<00:04:33.520> your

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
that and now after you accomplished your

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.710 
that and now after you accomplished your
split<00:04:35.950> you<00:04:36.220> will<00:04:36.520> not<00:04:36.669> be<00:04:36.820> able<00:04:36.850> to<00:04:37.090> do<00:04:37.270> a<00:04:37.300> split

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
split you will not be able to do a split

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.190 
split you will not be able to do a split
roll<00:04:38.080> a<00:04:38.400> split<00:04:39.400> role<00:04:39.700> is<00:04:39.970> not<00:04:40.030> that<00:04:40.450> hard<00:04:40.810> it's

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
roll a split role is not that hard it's

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.330 
roll a split role is not that hard it's
just<00:04:41.380> kind<00:04:41.560> of<00:04:41.650> complicated<00:04:42.160> at<00:04:42.310> first

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
just kind of complicated at first

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.590 
just kind of complicated at first
because<00:04:42.730> when<00:04:42.910> you<00:04:43.000> see<00:04:43.120> somebody<00:04:43.300> what

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
because when you see somebody what

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.280 
because when you see somebody what
you're<00:04:43.720> like<00:04:44.669> what<00:04:45.810> but<00:04:46.810> when<00:04:46.930> you<00:04:46.990> break<00:04:47.169> you

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
you're like what but when you break you

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:48.900 
you're like what but when you break you
down<00:04:47.410> step<00:04:47.710> by<00:04:47.740> step<00:04:48.070> it's<00:04:48.250> a<00:04:48.340> lot<00:04:48.490> easier<00:04:48.520> than

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
down step by step it's a lot easier than

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.390 
down step by step it's a lot easier than
anything<00:04:49.300> so<00:04:50.110> first<00:04:50.680> you<00:04:50.890> want<00:04:51.040> to<00:04:51.100> do<00:04:51.190> into

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
anything so first you want to do into

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:57.090 
anything so first you want to do into
your<00:04:51.520> slip<00:04:53.280> then<00:04:54.280> you<00:04:54.310> want<00:04:55.030> to<00:04:55.180> turn<00:04:55.480> to<00:04:56.100> wait

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
your slip then you want to turn to wait

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.270 
your slip then you want to turn to wait
like<00:04:57.780> wants<00:04:58.780> her<00:04:58.870> backwards<00:04:59.290> right<00:05:00.040> of<00:05:00.190> you

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
like wants her backwards right of you

with the vet with the vet is also
stretching<00:05:38.770> that<00:05:38.890> out<00:05:39.070> you<00:05:39.250> might<00:05:39.400> pop<00:05:39.669> your

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:39.850 
stretching that out you might pop your

back because that's what happened to me

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.530 
back because that's what happened to me
but<00:05:41.919> you<00:05:41.979> can<00:05:42.190> just<00:05:42.430> like<00:05:42.580> once<00:05:42.820> the<00:05:43.000> ground<00:05:43.300> or

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:43.540 
but you can just like once the ground or

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:46.530 
but you can just like once the ground or
grass<00:05:43.750> or<00:05:43.960> something<00:05:44.350> and<00:05:44.620> um<00:05:45.070> just<00:05:45.460> do<00:05:46.330> that

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:46.540 
grass or something and um just do that

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:53.190 
grass or something and um just do that
Creech<00:05:47.640> pop<00:05:48.640> back<00:05:48.930> beach<00:05:50.460> that<00:05:51.460> until<00:05:52.200> come

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:53.200 
Creech pop back beach that until come

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.870 
Creech pop back beach that until come
back<00:05:53.410> in<00:05:53.650> like<00:05:55.140> that<00:05:56.140> so<00:05:56.800> eventually<00:05:57.160> you<00:05:57.490> will

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:57.880 
back in like that so eventually you will

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:03.190 
back in like that so eventually you will
be<00:05:58.240> comfortable<00:05:58.870> and<00:05:59.610> yeah<00:06:00.610> so

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:03.200 

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:11.830 

that<00:06:04.200> and<00:06:04.560> then<00:06:05.120> split<00:06:06.120> again<00:06:09.410> split<00:06:10.670> forward

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:11.840 
that and then split again split forward

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.230 
that and then split again split forward
back<00:06:12.840> and<00:06:13.260> the<00:06:13.620> Crown's<00:06:14.040> answer<00:06:14.370> may<00:06:15.210> be

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 
back and the Crown's answer may be

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.910 
back and the Crown's answer may be
facing<00:06:15.600> the<00:06:15.840> opposite<00:06:16.140> direction<00:06:16.200> and<00:06:16.770> then

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:16.920 
facing the opposite direction and then

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:21.230 
facing the opposite direction and then
just<00:06:17.070> going<00:06:17.250> to<00:06:17.370> split<00:06:17.550> again<00:06:19.880> so<00:06:20.880> that<00:06:20.910> is<00:06:21.120> how

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 
just going to split again so that is how

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.120 
just going to split again so that is how
you<00:06:21.300> do<00:06:21.450> a<00:06:21.510> split<00:06:21.720> um<00:06:21.990> the<00:06:22.560> next<00:06:22.860> thing<00:06:23.010> is<00:06:23.070> a

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:23.130 
you do a split um the next thing is a

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:26.390 
you do a split um the next thing is a
handstand<00:06:23.610> I<00:06:24.740> might<00:06:25.740> add<00:06:25.860> to<00:06:25.890> that<00:06:26.010> into

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 
handstand I might add to that into

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.070 
handstand I might add to that into
another<00:06:26.580> video<00:06:26.940> so<00:06:27.210> make<00:06:27.510> sure<00:06:27.570> you<00:06:27.870> watch<00:06:28.050> the
