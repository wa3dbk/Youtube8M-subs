the Japanese have spent years studying
woodworking<00:00:41.260> techniques<00:00:41.380> and<00:00:41.710> understand

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160 
woodworking techniques and understand

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.580

that<00:00:42.640> your<00:00:43.300> lower<00:00:43.510> body<00:00:43.780> and<00:00:44.140> your<00:00:44.410> legs

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590 
that your lower body and your legs

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.740 
that your lower body and your legs
muscles<00:00:45.309> are<00:00:45.550> much<00:00:45.670> stronger<00:00:45.970> than<00:00:46.360> your

Adame that leverages as you wedge the

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.190 
Adame that leverages as you wedge the
blade<00:01:45.700> and<00:01:46.030> the<00:01:46.180> chip<00:01:46.390> breaker<00:01:46.570> in<00:01:46.810> that's

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
blade and the chip breaker in that's

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.500 
blade and the chip breaker in that's
what<00:01:47.350> leverage<00:01:47.650> is<00:01:47.860> that<00:01:48.070> the<00:01:48.729> blade<00:01:49.060> is<00:01:49.090> much

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
what leverage is that the blade is much

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:50.850 
what leverage is that the blade is much
heavier<00:01:49.900> than<00:01:49.930> you<00:01:50.200> would<00:01:50.350> find<00:01:50.619> in<00:01:50.799> a

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
heavier than you would find in a

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.270 
heavier than you would find in a
traditional<00:01:50.979> western-style<00:01:51.880> plane<00:01:52.780> and<00:01:53.280> made

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
traditional western-style plane and made

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.300 
traditional western-style plane and made
out<00:01:54.460> of<00:01:54.610> laminated<00:01:54.790> steel<00:01:55.420> very<00:01:56.080> heavy<00:01:56.380> great

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
out of laminated steel very heavy great

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.690 
out of laminated steel very heavy great
steel<00:01:57.640> and<00:01:57.939> the<00:01:58.750> manufacturer<00:01:59.590> cleans<00:02:00.430> out

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
steel and the manufacturer cleans out

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.750 
steel and the manufacturer cleans out
the<00:02:00.970> middle<00:02:01.450> of<00:02:01.570> this<00:02:01.830> so<00:02:02.830> that<00:02:03.070> you're<00:02:03.400> only

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
the middle of this so that you're only

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.500 
the middle of this so that you're only
flattening<00:02:04.450> this<00:02:05.229> edge<00:02:05.560> and<00:02:06.060> sharpening<00:02:07.060> that

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
flattening this edge and sharpening that

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.630 
flattening this edge and sharpening that
much<00:02:07.930> of<00:02:08.080> the<00:02:08.200> steel<00:02:08.500> in<00:02:08.709> a<00:02:08.979> traditional

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
much of the steel in a traditional

much of the steel in a traditional
western-style<00:02:10.090> plane<00:02:10.540> the<00:02:11.019> blade<00:02:11.410> needs<00:02:12.010> to

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
western-style plane the blade needs to

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.430 
western-style plane the blade needs to
be<00:02:12.250> flattened<00:02:12.790> almost<00:02:13.180> the<00:02:13.480> entire<00:02:13.780> way<00:02:14.200> down

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
be flattened almost the entire way down

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.430 
be flattened almost the entire way down
the<00:02:14.590> blade<00:02:14.830> and<00:02:15.040> so<00:02:15.580> without<00:02:16.150> a<00:02:16.450> -<00:02:16.570> still<00:02:17.140> it's

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
the blade and so without a - still it's

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.320 
the blade and so without a - still it's
very<00:02:17.650> simple<00:02:17.980> but<00:02:18.220> in<00:02:18.370> this<00:02:18.519> traditional

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
very simple but in this traditional

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:21.750 
very simple but in this traditional
Japanese<00:02:20.049> steel<00:02:20.320> they<00:02:21.190> help<00:02:21.370> you<00:02:21.459> out<00:02:21.489> by

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
Japanese steel they help you out by

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.460 
Japanese steel they help you out by
cleaning<00:02:22.090> that<00:02:22.360> out<00:02:22.570> so<00:02:23.019> you're<00:02:23.140> only<00:02:23.260> working

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
cleaning that out so you're only working

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:25.440 
cleaning that out so you're only working
on<00:02:23.709> the<00:02:23.769> edge<00:02:24.010> because<00:02:24.459> of<00:02:24.700> laminated<00:02:25.239> steel

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
on the edge because of laminated steel

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:26.910 
on the edge because of laminated steel
this<00:02:25.660> is<00:02:25.780> going<00:02:25.930> to<00:02:25.989> stay<00:02:26.110> razor<00:02:26.410> sharp<00:02:26.709> for<00:02:26.860> a

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
this is going to stay razor sharp for a

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.190 
this is going to stay razor sharp for a
long<00:02:27.130> time

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
long time

and<00:02:48.950> you<00:02:49.010> have<00:02:49.100> to<00:02:49.190> flatten<00:02:49.580> the<00:02:49.670> back<00:02:49.700> way

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.300 
and you have to flatten the back way
back<00:02:50.690> and<00:02:51.170> you<00:02:51.260> flatten<00:02:51.530> that<00:02:51.740> until<00:02:52.220> it's

back and you flatten that until it's
real<00:02:52.430> shiny<00:02:52.700> and<00:02:53.000> then<00:02:53.690> you<00:02:53.840> course<00:02:54.050> do<00:02:54.170> the

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
real shiny and then you course do the

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.890 
real shiny and then you course do the
shiny<00:02:54.560> part<00:02:54.910> on<00:02:55.910> the<00:02:56.030> front<00:02:56.210> to<00:02:56.630> make<00:02:56.660> the

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
shiny part on the front to make the

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.800 
shiny part on the front to make the

bevel with this style plane because the

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.890 
bevel with this style plane because the
steel<00:03:00.080> is<00:03:00.260> so<00:03:00.740> much<00:03:01.010> stronger<00:03:01.400> and<00:03:01.850> so<00:03:02.120> much

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
steel is so much stronger and so much

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.030 
steel is so much stronger and so much
more<00:03:03.110> robust<00:03:03.500> you<00:03:04.250> could<00:03:04.520> never<00:03:05.740> get<00:03:06.740> that<00:03:06.890> all

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
more robust you could never get that all

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.460 
more robust you could never get that all
flat<00:03:07.400> it's<00:03:08.180> just<00:03:08.390> just<00:03:08.570> too<00:03:08.780> much<00:03:08.930> steel<00:03:09.230> there

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
flat it's just just too much steel there

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.310 
flat it's just just too much steel there
so<00:03:10.100> they<00:03:10.550> clean<00:03:10.910> that<00:03:11.120> out<00:03:11.150> so<00:03:12.050> that<00:03:12.200> you're

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
so they clean that out so that you're

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.280 
so they clean that out so that you're
only<00:03:12.490> concentrating<00:03:13.490> on<00:03:13.640> the<00:03:13.790> edges<00:03:14.120> where<00:03:14.330> it

the edge which is actually doing the

the edge which is actually doing the

cutting and that's the part of here and

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:24.280 
cutting and that's the part of here and
you<00:03:23.390> can<00:03:23.510> see<00:03:23.630> it's<00:03:23.750> kind<00:03:23.870> of<00:03:23.930> it's<00:03:24.050> a<00:03:24.110> little

this<00:04:16.250> the<00:04:16.489> front<00:04:16.850> of<00:04:17.000> the<00:04:17.060> plane<00:04:17.239> although<00:04:17.390> it

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
this the front of the plane although it

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:18.820 
this the front of the plane although it
appears<00:04:17.900> to<00:04:17.989> be<00:04:18.080> the<00:04:18.169> back<00:04:18.290> it's<00:04:18.500> actually<00:04:18.620> the

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:18.830 
appears to be the back it's actually the

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:20.470 
appears to be the back it's actually the
front<00:04:19.070> because<00:04:19.340> this<00:04:19.700> is<00:04:19.790> on<00:04:19.880> the<00:04:20.000> full<00:04:20.180> stroke

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:20.480 
front because this is on the full stroke

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.810 
front because this is on the full stroke
and<00:04:20.780> that<00:04:20.810> put<00:04:21.500> that<00:04:21.770> part<00:04:22.250> of<00:04:22.340> the<00:04:22.400> plane<00:04:22.640> is

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
and that put that part of the plane is

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.280 
and that put that part of the plane is
chamfered<00:04:23.180> so<00:04:23.870> that's<00:04:24.020> where<00:04:24.140> you're<00:04:24.260> going

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
chamfered so that's where you're going

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:25.960 
chamfered so that's where you're going
to<00:04:24.590> hit<00:04:24.770> you<00:04:25.010> see<00:04:25.160> people<00:04:25.310> tapping<00:04:25.640> it<00:04:25.880> all

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
to hit you see people tapping it all

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.790 
to hit you see people tapping it all
over<00:04:26.270> the<00:04:26.360> place<00:04:26.570> but<00:04:27.020> this<00:04:27.169> is<00:04:27.230> actually

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
over the place but this is actually

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:28.870 
over the place but this is actually
where<00:04:27.950> you<00:04:27.980> should<00:04:28.190> be<00:04:28.250> hitting<00:04:28.370> it<00:04:28.580> and<00:04:28.820> you

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
where you should be hitting it and you

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.640 
where you should be hitting it and you
should<00:04:29.060> be<00:04:29.180> hitting<00:04:29.419> it<00:04:29.690> in<00:04:29.930> a<00:04:30.080> similar<00:04:30.500> angle

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
should be hitting it in a similar angle

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.690 
should be hitting it in a similar angle
Tao<00:04:30.980> the<00:04:31.600> blade<00:04:32.600> is<00:04:32.840> into<00:04:33.590> the<00:04:33.710> plane<00:04:33.980> and<00:04:34.190> so

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700
