00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:46.100 
their child is struggling so what are

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.280 
their child is struggling so what are
those<00:01:46.250> domains<00:01:46.670> the<00:01:47.240> first<00:01:47.509> domain<00:01:47.899> really

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
those domains the first domain really

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.800 
those domains the first domain really
focuses<00:01:48.829> on<00:01:48.860> what<00:01:49.220> are<00:01:49.340> the<00:01:49.490> rules<00:01:49.700> within<00:01:50.149> the

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
focuses on what are the rules within the

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.060 
focuses on what are the rules within the
household<00:01:51.939> kids<00:01:52.939> need<00:01:53.680> organization<00:01:54.680> kids

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
household kids need organization kids

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.060 
household kids need organization kids
need<00:01:55.399> guidance<00:01:56.060> around<00:01:56.329> how<00:01:56.960> to<00:01:57.020> behave<00:01:57.680> and

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
need guidance around how to behave and

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.219 
need guidance around how to behave and
so<00:01:58.340> what<00:01:58.939> are<00:01:59.090> the<00:01:59.180> rules<00:01:59.479> that<00:01:59.869> kind<00:02:00.140> of

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
so what are the rules that kind of

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.590 
so what are the rules that kind of
functionally<00:02:00.860> help<00:02:01.130> bring<00:02:01.549> kids<00:02:01.939> in<00:02:02.210> within

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
the family where are the consequences if

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.080
