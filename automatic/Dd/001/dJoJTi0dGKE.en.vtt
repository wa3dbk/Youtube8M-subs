00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:02.220
 hooglede 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.569
 i have i get quite busy the men ferrer this may however i will know 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:09.579
 tell what I'm doing 

00:00:09.579 --> 00:00:11.299
 I wanted to grab a two 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:12.769
 before and to warm up 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:14.609
 the German home 

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:18.490
 they are very rare but I have you on my last space trip 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.700
 Can catch 2 young ones and that good possibility 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:24.030
 they are in fact a fish bowl 

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.659
 but the growth is coming soon 

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:28.769
 I don't know exactly how big the room will be 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:29.960
 camp order 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.390
 and certainly a meter or three 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.050
 or that is not dangerous 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.740
 I thought so 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.870
 they did not come the man and son form of 3 meters can of course also 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.180
 shopping around you or just lie on top between plates starts 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:46.790
 therefore it must also be a robust shrink suit 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.620
 Then of course you want to know why the deepest valley is crawling 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.410
 I'll tell you 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.500
 because of the holes 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.650
 jef was a shock from a wormhole so the necessary space was created with then 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.160
 both sides 9 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.420
 gold can also be brought forward or back in time in a flash 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.910
 that is different than his old-fashioned time machine 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.450
 his orchard a hard to find 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.190
 and if you are there with your friend 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.990
 you just have to sit in the right place with a little bit 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.660
 so I'm going to put my house in order to make tree holes for me 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:23.900
 exactly on time and on the spot but no good 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.000
 but we had a good plan 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.190
 or is that a good plan 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.000
 I once found what they eat 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.480
 pieces of meteorite 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.370
 and occasionally open a coal 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.700
 Wednesday night and she the final 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.850
 take your hands off it 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.580
 in a little while and the second can begin 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.409
 but first build that container 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.559
 before she can have completely eaten herself in a fish bowl 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.860
 so if you have let me build quietly now 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.150
 and I close the door because nobody needs to know how my bonaparte 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.440
 is exactly put together and which materials I use
