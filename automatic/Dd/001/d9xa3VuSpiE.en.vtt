have<00:00:00.599> a<00:00:00.630> roux<00:00:00.900> what's<00:00:01.290> up<00:00:01.500> welcome<00:00:01.920> back<00:00:01.979> to

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:02.040 
have a roux what's up welcome back to

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.800 
have a roux what's up welcome back to
learning<00:00:02.310> it's<00:00:02.610> due<00:00:02.820> to<00:00:03.149> longer<00:00:03.300> be<00:00:03.480> covering

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
learning it's due to longer be covering

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.619 
learning it's due to longer be covering
XOR<00:00:04.350> gates<00:00:04.700> what<00:00:05.700> they<00:00:05.850> are<00:00:05.970> are<00:00:06.210> registering

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
XOR gates what they are are registering

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.410 
XOR gates what they are are registering
device<00:00:06.899> that<00:00:07.740> allows<00:00:08.160> you<00:00:08.340> to<00:00:08.370> use<00:00:08.700> multiple

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
device that allows you to use multiple

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.169 
device that allows you to use multiple
switches<00:00:09.690> at<00:00:10.110> the<00:00:10.349> same<00:00:10.650> time<00:00:10.950> so<00:00:11.910> little

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
switches at the same time so little

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.049 
switches at the same time so little
demonstration<00:00:12.420> here<00:00:12.990> if<00:00:13.230> you<00:00:13.410> have<00:00:14.059> two

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
demonstration here if you have two

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.490 
demonstration here if you have two
switches<00:00:15.570> and<00:00:15.750> you<00:00:15.900> want<00:00:16.020> to<00:00:16.139> use<00:00:16.260> them<00:00:16.350> at<00:00:16.410> the

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
switches and you want to use them at the

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.830 
switches and you want to use them at the
same<00:00:16.680> time<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.640> activate<00:00:17.910> this<00:00:18.180> piston<00:00:18.630> that's

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
same time to activate this piston that's

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.679 
same time to activate this piston that's
drat<00:00:19.699> so<00:00:20.699> if<00:00:20.789> you<00:00:20.850> had<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:20.970> pissin<00:00:21.300> up<00:00:21.420> here<00:00:21.660> I

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
drat so if you had a pissin up here I

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.480 
drat so if you had a pissin up here I
want<00:00:21.990> to<00:00:22.109> put<00:00:22.260> it<00:00:22.350> down<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.859> we<00:00:23.100> try<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.279> use

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
want to put it down and we try to use

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.170 
want to put it down and we try to use
this<00:00:23.640> switch<00:00:24.080> we<00:00:25.080> would<00:00:25.230> have<00:00:25.699> no<00:00:26.699> results

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
this switch we would have no results

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.759 
this switch we would have no results
obviously<00:00:27.599> because<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.109> power<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:28.439> already

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
obviously because the power is already

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.500 
obviously because the power is already
traveling<00:00:29.099> out<00:00:29.250> of<00:00:29.279> this<00:00:29.640> switch<00:00:29.910> here<00:00:30.150> so

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
traveling out of this switch here so

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.420 
traveling out of this switch here so
let's<00:00:31.349> take<00:00:31.500> that<00:00:31.679> down<00:00:31.859> enough<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.189> use<00:00:32.279> this

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
let's take that down enough to use this

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.139 
let's take that down enough to use this
switch<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:33.950> then<00:00:34.950> use<00:00:35.190> this<00:00:35.340> one<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.820> toggle

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
switch and then use this one to toggle

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.790 
switch and then use this one to toggle
bit<00:00:36.570> but<00:00:37.500> with<00:00:37.770> an<00:00:37.860> xor<00:00:38.160> gate<00:00:39.230> now<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.290> can<00:00:40.620> use

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
bit but with an xor gate now you can use

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.310 
bit but with an xor gate now you can use
multiple<00:00:40.950> switches<00:00:41.430> so<00:00:41.910> use<00:00:42.750> this<00:00:42.899> one<00:00:43.140> here

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
multiple switches so use this one here

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.760 
multiple switches so use this one here
to<00:00:43.440> put<00:00:43.530> it<00:00:43.620> up<00:00:43.760> put<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:44.820> down<00:00:45.200> set<00:00:46.200> up<00:00:46.440> and

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
to put it up put it down set up and

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:47.930 
to put it up put it down set up and
you're<00:00:46.950> in<00:00:47.039> another<00:00:47.250> room<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.610> your<00:00:47.730> house<00:00:47.910> and

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
you're in another room of your house and

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.299 
you're in another room of your house and
going<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.420> switch<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.780> down<00:00:48.960> again<00:00:49.309> whatever

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
going to switch it down again whatever

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.790 
going to switch it down again whatever
reason<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:50.700> switch<00:00:50.969> that<00:00:51.379> and<00:00:52.379> it<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:52.770> just

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
reason you switch that and it so just

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.760 
reason you switch that and it so just
down<00:00:53.809> for<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.870> controllable<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.530> can<00:00:55.649> do

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
down for the controllable you can do

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.229 
down for the controllable you can do
whatever<00:00:56.390> have<00:00:57.390> them<00:00:57.570> both<00:00:57.690> down<00:00:57.960> up<00:00:58.590> up<00:00:58.829> and

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
whatever have them both down up up and

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:01.939 
whatever have them both down up up and
toggle<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.390> from<00:01:00.809> what's<00:01:01.020> ever<00:01:01.260> switch<00:01:01.739> you're

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
toggle it from what's ever switch you're

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.340 
toggle it from what's ever switch you're
using<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:03.090> away<00:01:03.329> this<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.660> lot<00:01:03.840> like<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.019> tea

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
using and away this is a lot like a tea

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.890 
using and away this is a lot like a tea
flip<00:01:04.710> flop<00:01:04.979> but<00:01:05.460> with<00:01:05.820> buttons<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:06.689> if<00:01:06.810> you

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
flip flop but with buttons so if you

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.130 
flip flop but with buttons so if you
have<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.049> button<00:01:07.500> at<00:01:08.250> this<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:08.670> can<00:01:08.820> use

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
have a button at this you can use

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.250 
have a button at this you can use
multiple<00:01:10.140> ones<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.830> switch<00:01:11.070> between<00:01:12.260> what

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
multiple ones to switch between what

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.550 
multiple ones to switch between what
you're<00:01:13.409> doing<00:01:13.740> so<00:01:14.580> it's<00:01:15.090> very<00:01:15.290> very<00:01:16.290> small

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
you're doing so it's very very small

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.679 
you're doing so it's very very small
actually<00:01:16.799> very<00:01:17.189> compact<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:18.330> doesn't<00:01:18.570> use<00:01:18.659> a

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
actually very compact it doesn't use a

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.690 
actually very compact it doesn't use a
lot<00:01:18.900> of<00:01:18.930> redstone<00:01:19.380> just<00:01:19.799> mainly<00:01:20.189> redstone

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
lot of redstone just mainly redstone

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.740 
lot of redstone just mainly redstone
torches<00:01:21.060> so<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.420> don't<00:01:21.570> worry<00:01:21.659> after

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
torches so you don't worry after

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.870 
torches so you don't worry after
building<00:01:22.259> any<00:01:22.470> repeaters<00:01:23.460> or<00:01:23.610> anything<00:01:23.850> like

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
building any repeaters or anything like

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.109 
building any repeaters or anything like
that<00:01:24.000> or<00:01:24.770> Pistons<00:01:25.770> so<00:01:26.369> let's<00:01:26.580> jump<00:01:26.820> over<00:01:26.850> here

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
that or Pistons so let's jump over here

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.460 
that or Pistons so let's jump over here
and<00:01:27.270> quickly<00:01:27.659> show<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:27.930> how<00:01:28.080> to<00:01:28.140> build<00:01:28.290> it

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
and quickly show you how to build it

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.590 
and quickly show you how to build it
okay<00:01:28.829> so<00:01:28.890> start<00:01:29.310> off<00:01:29.520> with<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:29.939> line<00:01:30.180> of<00:01:30.210> three

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
okay so start off with a line of three

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.210 
okay so start off with a line of three
blocks<00:01:31.790> place<00:01:32.790> 10<00:01:33.060> front<00:01:33.619> to<00:01:34.619> red<00:01:34.770> stone<00:01:34.920> in

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
blocks place 10 front to red stone in

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.870 
blocks place 10 front to red stone in
the<00:01:35.280> middle<00:01:35.720> torch<00:01:36.720> on<00:01:37.079> each<00:01:37.290> side<00:01:37.880> torch

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
the middle torch on each side torch

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.360 
the middle torch on each side torch
torch<00:01:39.420> torch<00:01:40.850> redstone<00:01:42.470> blocks

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:44.370 
torch torch redstone blocks

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.630 
torch torch redstone blocks
redstone<00:01:45.210> torches<00:01:45.510> again<00:01:45.870> and<00:01:46.400> little<00:01:47.400> bit<00:01:47.520> to

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
redstone torches again and little bit to

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
redstone torches again and little bit to
read<00:01:47.760> soon<00:01:48.000> there<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.770> two<00:01:49.770> on<00:01:49.890> there<00:01:50.100> and

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 
read soon there and two on there and

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.150 
read soon there and two on there and
you're<00:01:51.660> done<00:01:51.930> placing<00:01:52.680> your<00:01:52.920> switches<00:01:53.310> and

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
you're done placing your switches and

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.750 
you're done placing your switches and
whatever<00:01:56.160> contraption<00:01:57.000> you're<00:01:57.120> activating

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
whatever contraption you're activating

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.920 
whatever contraption you're activating
the<00:01:59.760> purpose<00:02:00.120> of<00:02:00.210> this<00:02:00.300> basically<00:02:00.660> showing

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
the purpose of this basically showing

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.680 
the purpose of this basically showing
piston<00:02:01.380> on<00:02:02.270> off<00:02:04.160> so<00:02:05.160> in<00:02:05.580> case<00:02:05.790> you're<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.330> lot<00:02:06.600> of

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690
