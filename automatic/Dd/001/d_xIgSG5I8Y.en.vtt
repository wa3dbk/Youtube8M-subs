what's<00:00:00.780> up<00:00:00.960> guys<00:00:01.140> this<00:00:01.170> is<00:00:01.530> schism<00:00:01.890> we<00:00:02.010> are

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
what's up guys this is schism we are

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.039 
what's up guys this is schism we are
back<00:00:02.280> with<00:00:02.460> another<00:00:02.610> building<00:00:03.240> tutorial<00:00:03.419> here

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
back with another building tutorial here

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:05.329 
back with another building tutorial here
this<00:00:04.230> one<00:00:04.380> is<00:00:04.410> something<00:00:04.770> that<00:00:04.859> you<00:00:04.980> guys<00:00:05.130> have

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
this one is something that you guys have

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.900 
this one is something that you guys have
definitely<00:00:06.000> seen<00:00:06.270> before<00:00:06.629> but<00:00:07.639> part<00:00:08.639> of<00:00:08.760> why

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
definitely seen before but part of why

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.280 
definitely seen before but part of why
i'm<00:00:09.059> doing<00:00:09.269> this<00:00:09.420> is<00:00:09.719> just<00:00:10.019> for<00:00:10.139> my<00:00:10.260> own

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
i'm doing this is just for my own

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.310 
i'm doing this is just for my own
practice<00:00:10.620> and<00:00:11.570> the<00:00:12.570> reason<00:00:12.900> that<00:00:12.929> i<00:00:13.080> want<00:00:13.259> to

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
practice and the reason that i want to

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.660 
practice and the reason that i want to
practice<00:00:13.830> is<00:00:14.009> because<00:00:14.309> i'm<00:00:14.429> going<00:00:14.549> to<00:00:14.610> be

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
practice is because i'm going to be

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.700 
practice is because i'm going to be
starting<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:15.030> let's<00:00:15.269> build<00:00:15.540> series<00:00:15.990> soon<00:00:16.230> I've

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
starting a let's build series soon I've

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.140 
starting a let's build series soon I've
long<00:00:16.890> one<00:00:17.039> of<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.190> do<00:00:17.340> one<00:00:17.490> for<00:00:17.640> a<00:00:17.699> really

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
long one of the do one for a really

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.170 
long one of the do one for a really
really<00:00:18.180> long<00:00:18.570> time<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.460> this<00:00:20.460> is<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.880> perfect

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
really long time and this is the perfect

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.859 
really long time and this is the perfect
perfect<00:00:22.140> way<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:23.250> get<00:00:23.400> me<00:00:23.490> ready<00:00:23.640> for<00:00:23.760> that<00:00:24.060> but

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
perfect way to get me ready for that but

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.750 
perfect way to get me ready for that but
also<00:00:24.990> because<00:00:25.199> you<00:00:25.470> know<00:00:25.560> I've<00:00:25.890> used<00:00:25.920> circles

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
also because you know I've used circles

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.509 
also because you know I've used circles
and<00:00:26.939> building<00:00:27.269> a<00:00:27.990> fair<00:00:28.529> bit<00:00:28.740> in<00:00:28.800> my<00:00:29.039> time<00:00:29.279> here

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
and building a fair bit in my time here

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.240 
and building a fair bit in my time here
so<00:00:30.359> you<00:00:31.199> guys<00:00:31.320> probably<00:00:31.470> see<00:00:31.679> doing<00:00:31.830> already<00:00:32.009> I

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
so you guys probably see doing already I

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.650 
so you guys probably see doing already I
want<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.489> show<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:32.669> guys<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.820> couple<00:00:32.969> things<00:00:33.300> a

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
want to show you guys a couple things a

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.330 
want to show you guys a couple things a
couple<00:00:34.260> ways<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.440> build<00:00:34.649> circles<00:00:35.070> just<00:00:35.190> in

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
couple ways to build circles just in

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.740 
couple ways to build circles just in
case<00:00:35.460> you're<00:00:35.610> not<00:00:35.640> familiar<00:00:35.820> and<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.570> couple

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
case you're not familiar and a couple

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.150 
case you're not familiar and a couple
ways<00:00:36.899> you<00:00:36.960> can<00:00:37.200> implement<00:00:37.469> them<00:00:37.710> in<00:00:37.860> cool

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
ways you can implement them in cool

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.090 
ways you can implement them in cool
designs<00:00:38.719> so<00:00:39.719> with<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.350> game<00:00:40.559> that<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:40.770> all

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
designs so with a game that is all

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.549 
designs so with a game that is all
blocks<00:00:41.399> it<00:00:41.790> is<00:00:41.969> tough<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.210> get<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.480> circle<00:00:42.870> this

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
blocks it is tough to get a circle this

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.200 
blocks it is tough to get a circle this
is<00:00:43.710> really<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.980> smallest<00:00:44.340> circle<00:00:44.550> you<00:00:45.090> can

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
is really the smallest circle you can

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.330 
is really the smallest circle you can
have<00:00:45.360> I<00:00:45.480> guess<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.750> do<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:46.260> mean<00:00:47.100> like<00:00:47.190> if

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
have I guess you do I mean like if

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.630 
have I guess you do I mean like if
you're<00:00:47.460> really<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:48.629> know<00:00:49.100> if<00:00:50.100> you're<00:00:50.280> really

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
you're really you know if you're really

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.240 
you're really you know if you're really
really<00:00:51.620> struggling<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:52.890> could<00:00:53.010> say<00:00:53.219> that

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
really struggling you could say that

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.130 
really struggling you could say that
that's<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.699> circle<00:00:54.379> but<00:00:56.300> you<00:00:57.300> know<00:00:57.420> it's<00:00:57.690> it's

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
that's a circle but you know it's it's

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.160 
that's a circle but you know it's it's
tough<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:58.559> know<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.800> lot<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.010> choices<00:01:00.170> getting

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
tough you know a lot of choices getting

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.009 
tough you know a lot of choices getting
the<00:01:01.260> right<00:01:01.469> proportions<00:01:02.100> for<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.309> circle

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
the right proportions for a circle

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:08.179 
the right proportions for a circle
involves<00:01:04.019> increasing<00:01:04.970> return<00:01:06.320> so<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.740> larger

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
involves increasing return so the larger

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.000 
involves increasing return so the larger
that<00:01:08.640> you<00:01:08.790> make<00:01:09.000> this<00:01:09.180> thing<00:01:09.650> the<00:01:10.650> more<00:01:10.680> looks

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
that you make this thing the more looks

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.510 
that you make this thing the more looks
like<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.130> circle<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:13.100> inversely<00:01:14.100> we<00:01:14.400> have

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
like a circle and inversely we have

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.890 
like a circle and inversely we have
diminishing<00:01:14.880> returns<00:01:15.240> if<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.479> start<00:01:15.720> with<00:01:15.810> a

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
diminishing returns if you start with a

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.080 
diminishing returns if you start with a
big<00:01:16.020> circle<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.650> you're<00:01:17.100> going<00:01:17.340> down<00:01:17.549> it's

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
big circle and you're going down it's

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.280 
big circle and you're going down it's
going<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.360> look<00:01:18.479> less<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:18.960> less<00:01:19.049> like<00:01:19.229> a

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
going to look less and less like a

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.590 
going to look less and less like a
circle<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:20.369> closer<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.820> get<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.210> having

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
circle the closer you get to having

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.160 
circle the closer you get to having
fewer<00:01:21.960> blocks<00:01:22.430> so<00:01:23.479> this<00:01:24.479> is<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.720> couple<00:01:24.990> a

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
fewer blocks so this is a couple a

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.050 
fewer blocks so this is a couple a
couple<00:01:25.470> ways<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.310> I've<00:01:26.400> got<00:01:26.549> circles<00:01:26.909> here

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
couple ways that I've got circles here

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.580 
couple ways that I've got circles here
if<00:01:27.150> that<00:01:27.180> you<00:01:27.390> know<00:01:27.509> just<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.810> four<00:01:28.049> four

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
if that you know just the four four

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.340 
if that you know just the four four
corners<00:01:28.950> here<00:01:29.189> I've<00:01:29.970> got<00:01:30.119> two<00:01:30.299> by<00:01:30.420> two<00:01:30.479> all<00:01:31.320> the

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
corners here I've got two by two all the

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.679 
corners here I've got two by two all the
way<00:01:31.829> around<00:01:31.979> this<00:01:32.939> is<00:01:33.150> where<00:01:33.329> you<00:01:33.390> start<00:01:33.509> to

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
way around this is where you start to

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.630 
way around this is where you start to
get<00:01:33.780> into<00:01:33.990> actual<00:01:34.229> circle<00:01:34.650> theory<00:01:34.950> when<00:01:35.579> you

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
get into actual circle theory when you

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.730 
get into actual circle theory when you
start<00:01:35.880> with<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.060> side<00:01:36.240> of<00:01:36.270> three<00:01:36.740> because

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
start with the side of three because

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.530 
start with the side of three because
much<00:01:37.950> in<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.189> same<00:01:38.369> way<00:01:38.430> that<00:01:38.759> we<00:01:38.820> operated

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
much in the same way that we operated

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.020 
much in the same way that we operated
with<00:01:39.810> arches<00:01:40.880> where<00:01:41.880> we<00:01:42.060> have<00:01:42.270> decreasing

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
with arches where we have decreasing

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.910 
with arches where we have decreasing
columns<00:01:45.030> or<00:01:45.180> rows<00:01:45.240> 1<00:01:45.689> 2<00:01:45.930> 3<00:01:45.960> 4<00:01:46.380> 5<00:01:46.920> 1<00:01:47.850> 2<00:01:47.880> 3<00:01:48.030> 2<00:01:48.720> 1<00:01:49.110> 2<00:01:49.590> 3

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
going to look like a cool circle all the

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.040 
going to look like a cool circle all the
way<00:03:57.989> around<00:03:58.080> I<00:03:59.360> only<00:04:00.360> actually<00:04:00.660> just<00:04:00.810> finish<00:04:01.020> a

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
way around I only actually just finish a

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:02.840 
way around I only actually just finish a
side<00:04:01.290> of<00:04:01.320> this<00:04:01.500> show<00:04:02.430> you<00:04:02.489> guys<00:04:02.580> what<00:04:02.730> this

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:43.510 
circular design all the way around but

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.060 
circular design all the way around but
we<00:04:43.600> can<00:04:43.720> get<00:04:43.870> this<00:04:44.020> very<00:04:44.200> destroyed<00:04:44.770> looking

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
we can get this very destroyed looking

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:50.640 
we can get this very destroyed looking
look<00:04:46.050> very<00:04:47.050> cool<00:04:47.260> always<00:04:48.070> useful<00:04:48.360> so<00:04:49.360> yeah<00:04:49.650> now

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
look very cool always useful so yeah now

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:52.890 
look very cool always useful so yeah now
this<00:04:50.800> is<00:04:50.860> the<00:04:51.010> way<00:04:51.100> I<00:04:51.130> like<00:04:51.220> you<00:04:51.550> circles<00:04:51.970> when

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
this is the way I like you circles when

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.659 
this is the way I like you circles when
I<00:04:52.960> was<00:04:53.050> on<00:04:53.080> the<00:04:53.169> mindcrack<00:04:53.440> fan<00:04:53.710> server<00:04:53.980> one<00:04:54.580> of

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:54.669 
I was on the mindcrack fan server one of

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:57.360 
I was on the mindcrack fan server one of
my<00:04:54.730> spawn<00:04:55.030> town<00:04:55.360> houses<00:04:55.750> use<00:04:56.169> this<00:04:56.380> where<00:04:57.310> you

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
my spawn town houses use this where you

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.190 
my spawn town houses use this where you
have<00:04:57.400> not<00:04:58.120> circles<00:04:58.510> built<00:04:58.690> into<00:04:58.900> the<00:04:58.990> ground

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
have not circles built into the ground

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.409 
have not circles built into the ground
but<00:05:00.040> semicircles<00:05:00.730> coming<00:05:01.060> up<00:05:01.150> out<00:05:01.270> of<00:05:01.300> the

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419 
but semicircles coming up out of the

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:05.610 
but semicircles coming up out of the
ground<00:05:01.860> so<00:05:02.860> this<00:05:03.190> is<00:05:03.370> the<00:05:03.520> same<00:05:03.750> same<00:05:04.750> base

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
ground so this is the same same base

ground so this is the same same base
design<00:05:06.010> we<00:05:06.160> were<00:05:06.250> using<00:05:06.400> over<00:05:06.640> here<00:05:06.820> I<00:05:06.970> think<00:05:07.510> I

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
design we were using over here I think I

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.210 
design we were using over here I think I
went<00:05:07.930> with<00:05:08.050> the<00:05:08.290> middle<00:05:08.980> my<00:05:09.880> 3<00:05:10.710> 3<00:05:11.710> 2<00:05:11.860> 1<00:05:12.010> 2<00:05:12.190> 3

up in here I went with actually no I'm
sorry<00:05:27.940> this<00:05:28.090> was<00:05:28.270> the<00:05:28.419> the<00:05:28.720> largest<00:05:29.050> from<00:05:29.169> the

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
sorry this was the the largest from the

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.180 
sorry this was the the largest from the
532<00:05:31.080> bold<00:05:32.080> I<00:05:32.169> did<00:05:32.320> was<00:05:32.440> I<00:05:32.560> started<00:05:32.620> with<00:05:33.100> the

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
532 bold I did was I started with the

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:34.800 
532 bold I did was I started with the
middle<00:05:33.490> point<00:05:33.790> just<00:05:34.210> sticking<00:05:34.540> out<00:05:34.660> of<00:05:34.750> the

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
middle point just sticking out of the

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.590 
middle point just sticking out of the
ground<00:05:35.400> so<00:05:36.400> over<00:05:36.610> here<00:05:36.820> we<00:05:36.940> have<00:05:36.970> five<00:05:37.300> on<00:05:37.479> an

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:37.600 
ground so over here we have five on an

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.390 
ground so over here we have five on an
edge<00:05:37.720> and<00:05:38.020> then<00:05:38.229> it<00:05:38.320> goes<00:05:38.590> to<00:05:38.620> 3<00:05:39.040> 2<00:05:39.070> 1<00:05:39.790> 2<00:05:40.120> 3<00:05:40.150> 5<00:05:41.400> so

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
edge and then it goes to 3 2 1 2 3 5 so

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.100 
edge and then it goes to 3 2 1 2 3 5 so
I<00:05:42.729> took<00:05:42.850> the<00:05:43.060> midpoint<00:05:43.450> of<00:05:43.510> that<00:05:43.570> circle<00:05:43.990> which

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
I took the midpoint of that circle which

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.130 
I took the midpoint of that circle which
of<00:05:44.200> those<00:05:44.320> here<00:05:44.740> 1<00:05:45.250> 2<00:05:45.700> 3<00:05:45.970> blocks<00:05:46.450> and<00:05:46.750> start<00:05:47.050> at

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:47.140 
of those here 1 2 3 blocks and start at

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:51.390 
of those here 1 2 3 blocks and start at
that<00:05:47.260> on<00:05:47.820> the<00:05:48.820> ground<00:05:49.210> level<00:05:49.360> so<00:05:50.290> we<00:05:50.380> have<00:05:50.530> 1<00:05:51.010> 2

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 
that on the ground level so we have 1 2

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.930 
that on the ground level so we have 1 2
3<00:05:51.729> blocks<00:05:52.270> and<00:05:52.770> then<00:05:53.770> our<00:05:53.860> next<00:05:53.890> row<00:05:54.520> over<00:05:54.550> was

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:54.940 
3 blocks and then our next row over was

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:59.640 
3 blocks and then our next row over was
three<00:05:55.240> one<00:05:55.720> two<00:05:55.750> three<00:05:56.729> two<00:05:57.729> one<00:05:58.300> two<00:05:58.840> three

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 
three one two three two one two three

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:04.830 
three one two three two one two three
five<00:06:00.250> three<00:06:00.720> two<00:06:01.720> one<00:06:02.050> two<00:06:02.890> three<00:06:03.610> and<00:06:03.840> this

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:04.840 
five three two one two three and this

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.330 
five three two one two three and this
would<00:06:04.990> be<00:06:05.140> our<00:06:05.229> five<00:06:05.410> but<00:06:05.740> it's<00:06:05.890> cut<00:06:06.070> into<00:06:06.250> the

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:06.340 
would be our five but it's cut into the

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:09.060 
would be our five but it's cut into the
ground<00:06:06.810> so<00:06:07.810> when<00:06:08.229> you<00:06:08.320> do<00:06:08.440> stuff<00:06:08.620> like<00:06:08.710> that<00:06:08.860> it

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:09.070 
ground so when you do stuff like that it

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:10.500 
ground so when you do stuff like that it
lets<00:06:09.190> you<00:06:09.310> get<00:06:09.430> this<00:06:09.550> really<00:06:09.970> really

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:10.510 
lets you get this really really

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:12.659 
lets you get this really really
cool-looking<00:06:10.900> arch<00:06:11.470> design<00:06:11.710> so<00:06:12.520> you<00:06:12.580> know

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:12.669 
cool-looking arch design so you know

00:06:12.669 --> 00:06:15.260 
cool-looking arch design so you know
have<00:06:12.910> semicircle<00:06:13.630> coming<00:06:13.900> out<00:06:13.990> of<00:06:14.020> the<00:06:14.169> ground

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270 
have semicircle coming out of the ground

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.909 
have semicircle coming out of the ground
what<00:06:16.270> you<00:06:16.360> can<00:06:16.510> then<00:06:16.540> do<00:06:16.870> is<00:06:16.900> take<00:06:17.380> the<00:06:17.530> smaller

00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:17.919 
what you can then do is take the smaller

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:20.640 
what you can then do is take the smaller
circle<00:06:18.310> designs<00:06:18.610> and<00:06:18.910> cut<00:06:19.120> them<00:06:19.300> in<00:06:19.590> so<00:06:20.590> you

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:20.650 
circle designs and cut them in so you

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:22.409 
circle designs and cut them in so you
can<00:06:20.860> make<00:06:21.070> some<00:06:21.340> really<00:06:21.669> really<00:06:22.090> awesome

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:22.419 
can make some really really awesome

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:31.170 
increasing
or<00:06:26.530> decreasing<00:06:28.440> semicircles<00:06:29.820> when<00:06:30.820> you<00:06:30.910> space

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:31.180 
or decreasing semicircles when you space

00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:32.550 
or decreasing semicircles when you space
them<00:06:31.210> out<00:06:31.420> a<00:06:31.480> little<00:06:31.600> further<00:06:31.870> that<00:06:32.380> looks
