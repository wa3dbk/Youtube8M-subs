 that from genesis to deuteronomy form the 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.670
 bible of the Jews standing in the old 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:13.799
 Christian bible testament is the book 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:15.540
 most read and studied in the world but 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.330
 would be in the bible is another text 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.420
 code words hidden during 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.279
 three thousand three hundred years, which 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.240
 could be found after the 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.240
 computer invention 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.849
 a book released this week in the states 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.790
 United 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.860
 beard the coach the bible code says 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.649
 than five in the original text in 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.980
 Hebrew can be found in the past 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.379
 and the future everything that has already happened or will 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.780
 happening in the world 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.460
 the code would have been broken by a 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.230
 Israeli mathematician 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.300
 he made a computer program that 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.829
 search for words using a string 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.930
 number of letters 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.420
 the study was published a respected 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.760
 scientific journal and has undergone 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:05.760
 from a service code specialist 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:08.130
 American secret to understand how 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.650
 the code works let's use this phrase 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.930
 just look closely at the drawing 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.970
 appear between the letters the computer 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.520
 eliminates all spaces between the 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.189
 words begin with the first letter 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.880
 we skipped eight letters apart the ninth 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:26.310
 we skipped eight more and so on 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.470
 we found the word brasil so the 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.740
 resize the lines 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.240
 leaving the word in sequence 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.970
 then he looks for other words 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.759
 close to the first one here we can 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.590
 find at least nine 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.829
 Does this mean that the country is 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.860
 in coma found the route I love 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.860
 Brazil 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.159
 The Hebrew Bible has 304 thousand letters 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.549
 and your computer finds any 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:02:00.420
 possible spacing from one to 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:00.420
 of letters 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.700
 the book cites several events 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:08.619
 stories that would be encoded 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.789
 man's arrival to the moon 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.789
 I'm ambitious 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.730

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.270
 kennedy in dallas is the name of the killer 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:44.019
 a comet that crashed into Jupiter 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:46.630
 three years ago and until the

 which coordinates a study group 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.920
 in New York said he believes 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.400
 in the existence of a code made by the 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.500
 author of the bible for him god but not 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.260
 believe in this code 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.350
 he does not have statistical support is to have 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.910
 role of all sectors since the 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.040
 book was released with a large 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.530
 advertising campaign the author

 to give interviews wants to avoid 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:23.560
 controversy involving sacred scriptures 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.989
 and computers 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.260
 but the discussion has already taken over the network 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:32.560
 world of computers to the internet 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:37.690
 reactions to the bible code can be

 australians 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:45.190
 they repeat the experiment with a

 says Rabbi Salomon especially in 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:19.209
 Hebrew the language in which a word 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:21.459
 can have several interpretations in the center 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.590
 the most controversial is the affirmation of the 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.360
 author of the book that provided 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.400
 assassination of the prime minister of

 israel and isaac rabin 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:32.470
 he even went to Israel to warn the 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:34.240
 rabin that he was in danger of life 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.550
 after the murder he would have 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:40.060
 found near the rabbi of the name 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:42.720
 names of the criminal Amir and the city where 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:45.990
 rabin was killed for life 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:50.030
 What does that mean, nothing at all? 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:53.100
 coincidence conditioners 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:55.440
 coincidence of dates words in the

 other forecasts

 earthquakes in los angeles of japan 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:06.160
 all places where 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.160
 earthquakes are common 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:11.980
 in the year 2000 begins a world war 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:14.770
 which ends in 2006 with the holocaust 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:18.530
 atomic 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:21.410
 anyone who survives is no more than 2012 when 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:26.120
 a comet will fall from the sky and destroy the 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:28.640
 even the mathematician who made the code 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:30.560
 was on the internet complain about the book says 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:33.380
 that all attempts to predict 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:38.030
 using the code are futile and without 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:39.950
 value and not for michael drosnin it already 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:42.230
 He sold the rights for a studio
