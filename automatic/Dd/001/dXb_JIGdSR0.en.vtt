that<00:00:48.190> okay<00:00:49.190> and<00:00:49.760> I'm<00:00:50.420> actually<00:00:50.569> looking<00:00:50.929> at

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
that okay and I'm actually looking at

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.349 
that okay and I'm actually looking at
this<00:00:51.260> through<00:00:51.469> my<00:00:51.499> camera<00:00:51.949> screen<00:00:52.280> so<00:00:53.239> that's

00:00:53.349 --> 00:00:53.359 
this through my camera screen so that's

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:55.389 
this through my camera screen so that's
pretty<00:00:53.510> funny<00:00:53.749> but<00:00:53.989> this<00:00:54.829> is<00:00:54.949> nothing<00:00:55.280> special

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399 
pretty funny but this is nothing special

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:57.790 
pretty funny but this is nothing special
you<00:00:55.940> know<00:00:56.059> it's<00:00:56.239> an<00:00:56.329> average<00:00:56.749> 8-bit<00:00:57.260> game<00:00:57.559> you

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
you know it's an average 8-bit game you

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.610 
you know it's an average 8-bit game you
know<00:00:58.449> I'll<00:00:59.449> probably<00:00:59.749> run<00:01:00.170> out<00:01:00.229> of<00:01:00.350> time

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
know I'll probably run out of time

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:06.870 
know I'll probably run out of time
because<00:01:00.859> I<00:01:01.069> I<00:01:01.429> sucked<00:01:01.940> like<00:01:02.089> this<00:01:02.389> and<00:01:04.899> yeah

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
I think I'll do um mega jump you can't

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:24.699 
I think I'll do um mega jump you can't
see<00:02:14.550> it<00:02:14.700> but<00:02:14.910> the<00:02:15.090> code<00:02:15.330> is<00:02:15.680> Gaz<00:02:16.700> you<00:02:17.700> a<00:02:17.730> G<00:02:18.590> so<00:02:19.590> G

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
probably do moon gravity as well why AZ

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.950 
can find a work zone in world one dash
one<00:04:29.550> that<00:04:29.760> would<00:04:29.850> be<00:04:29.940> really<00:04:30.090> helpful<00:04:30.330> but<00:04:30.930> uh

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
one that would be really helpful but uh

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.250 
one that would be really helpful but uh
more<00:04:31.830> on<00:04:31.949> warp<00:04:32.190> zones<00:04:32.430> later<00:04:32.699> up<00:04:33.360> there<00:04:33.600> we<00:04:33.660> go

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.930 

and<00:04:37.260> because<00:04:38.010> it's<00:04:38.160> moon<00:04:38.310> gravity<00:04:38.490> I<00:04:38.669> last

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
and because it's moon gravity I last

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:47.120 
and because it's moon gravity I last
longer<00:04:39.389> ah<00:04:42.560> oh<00:04:43.669> well<00:04:44.669> but<00:04:45.360> uh<00:04:45.419> yeah<00:04:46.020> so<00:04:46.680> that's

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
longer ah oh well but uh yeah so that's

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:48.860 
longer ah oh well but uh yeah so that's
the<00:04:47.370> enhancement<00:04:47.970> power<00:04:48.120> of<00:04:48.300> the<00:04:48.389> game<00:04:48.570> genie

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
the enhancement power of the game genie

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.800
