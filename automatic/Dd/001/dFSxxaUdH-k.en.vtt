any way you want to I think the next
time<00:01:42.710> I<00:01:42.740> try<00:01:42.920> this<00:01:43.160> I'm<00:01:43.490> going<00:01:43.700> to<00:01:43.760> try<00:01:43.940> to<00:01:44.000> spin

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
time I try this I'm going to try to spin

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.790 
time I try this I'm going to try to spin
it<00:01:44.390> from<00:01:44.600> the<00:01:44.690> center<00:01:44.930> and<00:01:45.230> make<00:01:45.410> a<00:01:45.440> spiral

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
it from the center and make a spiral

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.220 
it from the center and make a spiral
effect<00:01:46.100> but<00:01:46.940> for<00:01:47.240> the<00:01:47.300> sake<00:01:47.450> of<00:01:47.480> this<00:01:47.630> video<00:01:47.960> I

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:48.230 
effect but for the sake of this video I

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:50.860 
effect but for the sake of this video I
just<00:01:48.260> did<00:01:48.680> it<00:01:48.800> like<00:01:48.980> this<00:01:49.450> now<00:01:50.450> it's<00:01:50.660> time<00:01:50.840> to

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:50.870 
just did it like this now it's time to

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.780 
just did it like this now it's time to
be<00:01:51.170> creative<00:01:51.650> and<00:01:51.830> do<00:01:51.980> whatever<00:01:52.160> you<00:01:52.430> want

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
be creative and do whatever you want

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.760 
be creative and do whatever you want
because<00:01:53.150> I<00:01:53.360> chose<00:01:53.750> blue<00:01:54.080> and<00:01:54.260> green<00:01:54.500> and

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
because I chose blue and green and

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:56.830 
because I chose blue and green and
because<00:01:55.100> I<00:01:55.310> put<00:01:55.610> three<00:01:55.910> rubber<00:01:56.090> bands<00:01:56.360> on<00:01:56.660> my

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
because I put three rubber bands on my

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.140 
because I put three rubber bands on my
hat<00:01:57.110> that<00:01:57.710> means<00:01:57.920> I<00:01:58.100> have<00:01:58.220> four<00:01:58.490> sections<00:01:58.970> to

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
hat that means I have four sections to

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.330 
hat that means I have four sections to
color<00:01:59.360> so<00:01:59.780> I<00:01:59.810> just<00:02:00.140> alternated<00:02:00.830> between<00:02:00.860> the

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
color so I just alternated between the

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.280 
color so I just alternated between the
blue<00:02:01.580> and<00:02:01.850> the<00:02:01.940> green<00:02:02.270> and<00:02:02.570> then<00:02:02.990> I<00:02:03.080> made<00:02:03.260> the

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
blue and the green and then I made the

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.560 
blue and the green and then I made the
visor<00:02:03.710> and<00:02:04.160> the<00:02:04.220> velcro<00:02:04.940> part<00:02:05.150> of<00:02:05.270> my<00:02:05.390> hat

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
visor and the velcro part of my hat

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
visor and the velcro part of my hat
black<00:02:05.900> I<00:02:07.540> didn't<00:02:08.540> want<00:02:08.690> to<00:02:08.780> screw<00:02:08.990> up<00:02:09.080> my<00:02:09.200> hat

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
black I didn't want to screw up my hat

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.680 
black I didn't want to screw up my hat
by<00:02:09.860> squirting<00:02:10.280> dye<00:02:10.700> directly<00:02:11.330> from<00:02:11.450> the

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
by squirting dye directly from the

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.840 
by squirting dye directly from the
bottle<00:02:11.870> so<00:02:12.470> instead<00:02:12.830> of<00:02:12.890> doing<00:02:13.280> that<00:02:13.310> I<00:02:13.490> took<00:02:13.820> a

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
bottle so instead of doing that I took a

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.880 
bottle so instead of doing that I took a
paintbrush<00:02:14.330> and<00:02:14.660> painted<00:02:15.140> the<00:02:15.230> black<00:02:15.350> on<00:02:15.650> the

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:15.890 
paintbrush and painted the black on the

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:18.100 
paintbrush and painted the black on the
