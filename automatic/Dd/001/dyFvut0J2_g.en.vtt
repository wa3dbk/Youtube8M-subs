 blog money earn point net and in this 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:20.119
 Today's video lesson I'm going to teach you 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:23.599
 you about remarketing remarketing the 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:26.119
 that's how it works and marketing for 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:28.099
 help you understand how this 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.439
 strategy works 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:33.320
 I'll draw for you here then I 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:36.230
 I made this video here an animation where I 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:39.170
 I'll make drawing easier. 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.510
 then how does it get to the things of the 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.820
 The following way, imagine what you want. 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.190
 promote a product on the internet so 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.770
 Do you have there the site of the product that you 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.260
 want to promote can be a product of your 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.270
 same or may be a product of another 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.550
 person you can be a member of 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.920
 Everything okay, no problem, you? 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.870
 can do the shot in two ways 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.280
 so we have here the product site 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.949
 let's not say that the product 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.140
 wonderful that you created or that you 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:09.650
 want to promote right you really 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.390
 likes products and believes in the product 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.030
 So you have the site you want. 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:17.210
 promote what you are going to do 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:20.810
 let's say that at first you will 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:24.439
 make ads on facebook edis for 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:27.290
 promote this product you will make a 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:29.390
 shot using facebook is 10 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.430
 and I know I can do a shot with 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.829
 facebook is also with google adwords 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.420
 here is more in our example get the 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:37.100
 facebook and tell 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:41.000
 today a lot of people are using facebook 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:43.040
 they then what happens you have there 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.939
 your product 's website is promoting you will 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:50.180
 then make an ad in facebook apps 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:52.790
 and turned to do the auction 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:56.030
 So you're going to do your publicity there. 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:59.960
 on facebook before you will put your 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:03.649
 cute ad there the visitor is there 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:06.170
 see your ad interest and click and 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:08.899
 going to your site is vital website of 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:12.380
 good product all right 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.900
 when the visitor arrives on the site the site 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.620
 already been prepared for remarketing then 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:21.769
 he makes it mark on the computer 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.569
 visitor that this advisor visitor 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.459
 this announcement so he can 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:28.489
 work remax after making a 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:31.220
 marking by means of the cookie it records 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.930
 on the visitor's computer is not 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.379
 recorded a file on the computer 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.670
 visitor indicating that he visited the 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:40.159
 your site 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.680
 this mark is necessary for him to be able to 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:45.530
 do remarketing later for this 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.230
 good visitor that happens is that 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.810
 visitor the first time he visits 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.510
 the site he hardly buys is very 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.239
 hard a person visiting a website 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.220
 an offer of a product of a service and 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.079
 already buy soon face to face 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.879
 then this visitor is left with more doubt 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:02.840
 Is it because I buy products and that's good? 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:05.390
 same 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.390
 Ah, I think I'll think better. 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:11.260
 Another time I'll solve it. 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:15.049
 and he does not buy the product at the moment 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:17.390
 Sure he does not buy it leaves your site 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:19.430
 or leave the site you have advertised 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.480
 and then he will do other things in the 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.340
 Internet 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.650
 one of the things he's going to do that 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:28.370
 practically everybody does today is 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:31.790
 browsing facebook is watching the messages 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.019
 and people 's poles is chatting and 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.200
 everything else is not right 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:40.069
 so he will surf facebook 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:42.319
 only facebook is already prepared and already 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:44.750
 made marketing campaigns 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:47.720
 so facebook identifies that this 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.699
 visitor has visited your site once 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:52.160
 what will happen 

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:55.400
 facebook will start showing 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.829
 again advertisement for that person going 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.349
 start showing ads from the same 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:02.930
 product you've reported this to 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:06.440
 remarketing, did you do the marketing a 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:09.230
 and now it's doing again then 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.540
 You do a shot on top of that. 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.180
 visitor on the ad you already 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.370
 previously made this auction announcement 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.829
 It can be different, not to stay 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.349
 same as that first advertisement will have a 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:24.500
 another ad maybe speaking words 

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:27.169
 different different ads already thought 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:30.560
 to a person who has already visited the site 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:32.620
 once then facebook will show 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.780
 these ads again 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.430
 we will say that it ignores the 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.580
 first advertisement but while she 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:42.550
 keep browsing facebook on such 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.740
 chatting watching the posts watch on 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.710
 video etc 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:50.500
 again your ad will appear with 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.970
 that person will even pursue this 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.919
 person on the internet 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.860
 she will see the ad again talking 

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:58.510
 of the same product it will already be half 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.580
 negriela laura pulls life right 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.130
 I already visited the site of this product there 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.590
 I did not buy but look how it looks 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:08.440
 ad again does is it 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:11.729
 firefighter this product is good that she 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:14.500
 keep browsing and facebook continues 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:17.650
 showing the advertisement of your beach product 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:22.090
 of the product you want to advertise then 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:25.750
 not given time one speaks pulls will 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:28.240
 look better if this product I do not 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:32.260
 click here again and click and return there 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:34.330
 pro site of the product again and how it 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.900
 already seen once seen multiple ads 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:39.190
 such 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:42.220
 she is much more likely to click on the 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:45.610
 button and buy the product and there 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:48.490
 that you will earn your commission then 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:51.130
 this remarketing strategy is like this 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:54.130
 that works the way the person 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:57.669
 will see the ad multiple times and will 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:06:00.430
 end up buying it is kind of because due to 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:02.110
 insistence o the ads will appear 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:04.360
 several times for her of the same 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.820
 product since she visited the 

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.710
 first time site 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:10.570
 now if you want to know how to do 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:14.380
 remarque I'll put down that 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:17.740
 video some links of digital products 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:20.560
 courses that teach you how to work with 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:23.440
 remarketing already has some experts 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.660
 on the internet working with a shot 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:28.960
 Very well that you know very well about this. 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:32.110
 and will teach you step by step how to create 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:36.070
 campaigns to remarket your 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:38.680
 internet business including some 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:40.950
 experts say that the auction increases 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:44.340
 increases exponentially. 

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:46.920
 the sales conversion rate because it 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:49.500
 kinda chasing the person ends here 

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:52.020
 It is you you will capture the attention of the 

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:53.910
 person who has already shown interest 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:56.310
 product you are advertising it already 

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:59.190
 she was once on the site once, so it's a 

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:01.650
 person much more likely to acquire a 

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:04.170
 product when you do the auction because 

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:06.600
 she has shown interest once is very 

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:08.370
 it is easier for this person to acquire than 

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:10.350
 a person who is seeing your ad 

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:13.260
 for the first time then this is philosophy 

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:15.270
 of Mars and is a strategy that 

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:17.430
 much more your sales are then down 

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:19.740
 of this video are some links from 

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:22.020
 products that I recommend teaching 

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:23.610
 You work a lot and if you 

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.890
 Did you like this class video? 

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:28.290
 do not forget to subscribe to my channel 

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:29.310
 and also gives a young man still did not like the 

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:31.380
 youtube 

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:34.100
 It was great hug and a lot of attention. 

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:34.100
 success for you
