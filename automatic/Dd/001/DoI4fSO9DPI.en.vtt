you could also put other types of tools
in<00:02:21.360> as<00:02:21.540> well<00:02:21.750> we<00:02:22.560> were<00:02:22.650> going<00:02:22.800> to<00:02:22.860> work<00:02:23.040> on<00:02:23.190> a

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
in as well we were going to work on a

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.100 
in as well we were going to work on a
sprinkler<00:02:23.760> project<00:02:24.300> so<00:02:24.450> we<00:02:24.480> were<00:02:24.690> able<00:02:24.780> to<00:02:24.930> put

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
sprinkler project so we were able to put

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.420 
sprinkler project so we were able to put
the<00:02:25.140> sprinkler<00:02:25.620> there<00:02:25.800> so<00:02:25.950> it<00:02:26.069> wouldn't<00:02:26.340> get

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
the sprinkler there so it wouldn't get

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.270 
the sprinkler there so it wouldn't get
lost<00:02:26.640> one<00:02:27.360> of<00:02:27.390> our<00:02:27.600> solar<00:02:27.930> lights<00:02:28.290> was<00:02:28.680> broken

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.860 
lost one of our solar lights was broken
so<00:02:29.310> we<00:02:29.610> could<00:02:29.760> put<00:02:29.970> that<00:02:30.120> in<00:02:30.300> there<00:02:30.420> to<00:02:30.510> replace

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
so we could put that in there to replace

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.900 
so we could put that in there to replace
it<00:02:30.900> we<00:02:31.380> have<00:02:31.560> a<00:02:31.590> defined<00:02:31.980> two<00:02:32.250> of<00:02:32.340> our<00:02:32.460> missing

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.490 
it we have a defined two of our missing
telephone<00:02:33.270> poles<00:02:33.540> so<00:02:33.720> we<00:02:33.840> put<00:02:34.050> them<00:02:34.200> in<00:02:34.350> there

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
telephone poles so we put them in there

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.470 
telephone poles so we put them in there

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
so when we would go outside we remember

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.840 
so when we would go outside we remember
to<00:02:36.630> reinstall<00:02:37.290> them<00:02:37.470> and<00:02:37.740> we<00:02:38.070> even<00:02:38.190> found<00:02:38.640> that

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
to reinstall them and we even found that

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.330 
to reinstall them and we even found that
you<00:02:38.940> could<00:02:39.090> clip<00:02:39.480> a<00:02:39.870> measuring<00:02:40.590> tape<00:02:40.830> onto<00:02:41.130> the

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
you could clip a measuring tape onto the

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.670 
you could clip a measuring tape onto the
side<00:02:41.580> of<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.820> unit<00:02:42.060> as<00:02:42.180> well<00:02:42.420> so<00:02:42.930> it<00:02:43.230> worked

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
side of the unit as well so it worked

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.120

get<00:03:38.940> the<00:03:39.090> strap<00:03:39.780> installed<00:03:40.470> and<00:03:40.740> then<00:03:40.890> you<00:03:41.010> can

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
get the strap installed and then you can

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.520 
get the strap installed and then you can
adjust<00:03:41.520> it<00:03:41.670> later<00:03:41.700> we<00:03:42.450> found<00:03:42.690> that<00:03:42.870> we<00:03:42.930> wanted

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
adjust it later we found that we wanted

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.650 
adjust it later we found that we wanted
to<00:03:43.560> adjust<00:03:44.010> it<00:03:44.190> higher<00:03:44.700> so<00:03:45.120> that<00:03:45.150> it<00:03:45.300> would<00:03:45.390> sit

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
to adjust it higher so that it would sit

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.050 
to adjust it higher so that it would sit
up<00:03:45.810> more<00:03:46.200> on<00:03:46.410> our<00:03:46.560> hip<00:03:46.890> when<00:03:47.430> we<00:03:47.550> carried<00:03:47.970> it

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
up more on our hip when we carried it

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.550 
up more on our hip when we carried it
and<00:03:48.180> we<00:03:48.240> found<00:03:48.390> it<00:03:48.510> was<00:03:48.660> very<00:03:48.900> easy<00:03:49.110> to<00:03:49.440> adjust

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
and we found it was very easy to adjust

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.820 
and we found it was very easy to adjust
and<00:03:50.040> get<00:03:50.520> it<00:03:50.640> to<00:03:50.700> the<00:03:50.760> position<00:03:51.240> we<00:03:51.390> needed<00:03:51.830> so

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
and get it to the position we needed so

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.010 
and get it to the position we needed so
I'd<00:03:53.070> really<00:03:53.250> take<00:03:53.820> a<00:03:53.850> look<00:03:54.120> at<00:03:54.270> also<00:03:54.690> ordering

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
I'd really take a look at also ordering

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.810 
I'd really take a look at also ordering
this<00:03:55.380> it'll<00:03:55.740> give<00:03:55.890> you<00:03:55.980> a<00:03:56.010> little<00:03:56.340> bit<00:03:56.580> more

another<00:03:59.670> option<00:04:00.330> of<00:04:00.450> not<00:04:00.480> just<00:04:00.810> attaching<00:04:01.500> a

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
another option of not just attaching a

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.070 
another option of not just attaching a
to<00:04:01.709> device<00:04:02.040> but<00:04:02.610> allowing<00:04:02.820> you<00:04:03.180> to<00:04:03.390> carry<00:04:03.900> it

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.660 

the<00:04:10.079> last<00:04:10.349> item<00:04:10.650> that<00:04:11.010> we<00:04:11.129> got<00:04:11.340> was<00:04:11.549> the

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
the last item that we got was the

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.089 
the last item that we got was the
optional<00:04:12.150> wall<00:04:12.569> attachment<00:04:13.409> and<00:04:13.560> this<00:04:13.980> is

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 
optional wall attachment and this is

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:16.249 
optional wall attachment and this is
actually<00:04:14.519> a<00:04:14.549> rather<00:04:14.819> simple<00:04:15.390> and<00:04:15.599> unique<00:04:15.719> idea

00:04:16.249 --> 00:04:16.259 
actually a rather simple and unique idea

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:18.650 
actually a rather simple and unique idea
it's<00:04:16.829> basically<00:04:17.310> just<00:04:17.430> a<00:04:17.880> piece<00:04:18.239> of<00:04:18.269> metal

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
it's basically just a piece of metal

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.240 
it's basically just a piece of metal
that<00:04:18.900> attaches<00:04:19.199> to<00:04:19.410> the<00:04:19.650> wall<00:04:19.829> so<00:04:20.100> you<00:04:20.130> can

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250

three<00:04:42.630> quarter<00:04:42.900> inch<00:04:43.080> backing<00:04:43.620> on<00:04:43.740> the<00:04:43.830> side

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:44.009 
three quarter inch backing on the side

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:46.790 
three quarter inch backing on the side
of<00:04:44.039> our<00:04:44.250> wall<00:04:44.610> in<00:04:44.970> our<00:04:45.389> outbuilding<00:04:46.139> so<00:04:46.650> we

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
of our wall in our outbuilding so we

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.320 
of our wall in our outbuilding so we
leveled<00:04:47.130> it<00:04:47.250> attached<00:04:47.699> to<00:04:47.729> screw<00:04:48.120> to<00:04:48.240> the

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:48.330 
leveled it attached to screw to the

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:49.610 
leveled it attached to screw to the
other<00:04:48.479> and<00:04:48.690> now<00:04:48.780> there<00:04:48.960> are<00:04:49.050> a<00:04:49.110> lot<00:04:49.320> of<00:04:49.349> holes

other and now there are a lot of holes

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:50.900 
other and now there are a lot of holes
in<00:04:49.830> here<00:04:49.979> but<00:04:50.160> I<00:04:50.190> don't<00:04:50.280> think<00:04:50.610> you<00:04:50.699> need<00:04:50.789> to

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
in here but I don't think you need to

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.850 
in here but I don't think you need to
put<00:04:51.060> a<00:04:51.090> screw<00:04:51.360> in<00:04:51.389> every<00:04:51.720> single<00:04:51.930> one<00:04:52.229> so<00:04:52.770> we

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
put a screw in every single one so we

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.860 
put a screw in every single one so we
attached<00:04:53.160> two<00:04:53.610> more<00:04:53.910> kind<00:04:54.449> of<00:04:54.599> near<00:04:54.750> the

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
attached two more kind of near the

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.499 
attached two more kind of near the
middle<00:04:55.050> and<00:04:55.289> it<00:04:56.099> was<00:04:56.370> installed<00:04:56.789> so<00:04:57.210> we<00:04:57.330> found

00:04:57.499 --> 00:04:57.509 
middle and it was installed so we found

00:04:57.509 --> 00:04:58.969 
middle and it was installed so we found
the<00:04:57.630> installation<00:04:58.169> of<00:04:58.229> this<00:04:58.349> very<00:04:58.710> very

00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 
the installation of this very very

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:01.460 
the installation of this very very
simple<00:04:59.550> and<00:04:59.669> it<00:05:00.150> makes<00:05:00.389> it<00:05:00.570> versatile<00:05:01.289> because
