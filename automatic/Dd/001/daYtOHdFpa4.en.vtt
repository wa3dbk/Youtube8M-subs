00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 When I stayed locker I get distracted 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.009
 new video of the section I love 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.799
 the cars I'm going to explain a 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.269
 little that I would have to study those 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.980
 people that is engine function 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.570
 you have to study or as you should and 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.860
 direct your studies to finish 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.860
 working in the motor world 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.200
 the dynamics of the video is going to be divided into 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.510
 parts editions because everything has 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.330
 branches coming from a path always 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.340
 can reach the maximum no it is not a single 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.100
 path is a bit I will go little by little and 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.930
 saying each branch if any one understands 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.480
 Well, you mention it by sanz I wrote it 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.250
 per comment answer happy I'm going to 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.870
 from compulsory education is 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.050
 primary and secondary once we finish 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.420
 that we have three outputs that I read 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.430
 that would be to leave the world of work 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.070
 work but just as is the thing today and 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.899
 without studies I doubt very much to find ourselves 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.120
 that is something familiar I doubt that 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.070
 find but good is an option other 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.420
 would be zero a medium degree and others third 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.309
 high school 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.780
 attending the middle grade as the 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.550
 preparation that the degree means to be 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.270
 mechanical is to finish working a 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.710
 mechanical workshop 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.590
 is lucky to be able to deliver something more 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:14.950
 but basically no gz 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.229
 efe is the top grade to be 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.020
 mechanical then it's been two years that this 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.399
 electromechanical body and another more 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.229
 that are two years that prepare you 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:25.090
 mainly for it deepen 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:28.450
 much in everything in gearbox 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.450
 clutches brakes all very very a 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.280
 background 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:36.950
 then once you finish this 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.950
 You could do it the same as by sea 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.670
 the technological because it is the most 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.930
 It's a bit closer to that, but good 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.820
 nor that any present 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.100
 high school if you finish your baccalaureate 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.290
 You can also access the upper level 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.430
 and any of the middle grade there where 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.560
 we would be the same and that we could 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.659
 having medium grade we could access 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.850
 to the superior and will have a baccalaureate 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.180
 we can access the superior and the 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.670
 career 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:05.470
 and having the superior we can do the 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:07.180
 upper middle grade there is a test of 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.220
 access that the truth is that I do not have 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.420
 idea because I have not done it remains a 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.710
 programming that is not very complicated 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.830
 but good you have to prepare as all 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.510
 test that is 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.190
 and to enter from high school to the grade 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.290
 superior does not need anything simply 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.060
 goes for the average high school grade as well 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.510
 if you want to enter prepare yours louis 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.310
 have stable notes you have a 5.5 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.980
 there will be people above with an average of 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.650
 a 66 and something between sure 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.180
 once is once here you can choose 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.769
 as I said between career or grade 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.590
 superior a superior what I am 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:38.330
 going to it and basically not 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.400
 prepared for mechanics but prepare 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.890
 the stick for mechanic but it prepares 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.150
 as for boss in workshop or to create you 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.500
 your own company there is a part 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.360
 businesswoman in which they talk to you about how 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.700
 that to a company the permits and everything 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.560
 that and then another part people believe they 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.450
 prepares to be a head workshop for 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.250
 have a group of employees at your expense 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.110
 When a car arrived at the reception 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.849
 Well, you can say that you identify 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.780
 the problem the inces to the mechanic 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:01.780
 you have to do this 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.840
 a workshop boss or someone a degree 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.860
 superior knows everything but not so in 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.110
 depth like what we have sown 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.760
 medium for taken superiority three that 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.140
 there have been three and a half grade I 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.730
 said the three that I said that the 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.519
 last suppose it 's electronic or that 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.129
 body another plus those three have them 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:22.530
 the deepening of two years must 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:24.840
 give everything the three individually 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.630
 also two years then you give a lot very 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.280
 fast but you do not go deep 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.750
 and exhaustion that is part of the 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.950
 company that's what the degree is 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.380
 higher 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.820
 then already signs but if not you 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.620
 you agree on a career with a career 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.420
 Well, the options that I well Spain 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.459
 Careers are few 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.020
 the only one that I've seen that really 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.790
 leads the motor world will be the 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:46.140
 inside of the car but that's the same 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.319
 is private even in madrid 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.640
 nebrija and it is very expensive here the people who 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.230
 can afford it is better luck 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.640
 because it is true that the 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.739
 little ball for people who have no money 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.739
 obviously he can not afford it 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.380
 I even think that just as is the 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.500
 thing even with scholarships is the thing 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:07.360
 complicated 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:08.680
 so the other option a little more than 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.000
 it's not so direct to the motor world 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.680
 but it 's fine I would be the engineer 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.600
 mechanics I started engineering 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.329
 mechanics 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:18.190
 and deep down to third you're left with something 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.989
 related to thermal engines not 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.210
 has nothing to do or is not I thought is 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.590
 principle my technique this the engine had 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.410
 mechanics is a lot of mechanics of 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.870
 materials this is how it would be in doing 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:31.150
 mechanical lingerie and not doing a master's degree and 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.409
 already and because then professionalized not to do 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.330
 anything else 

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:36.279
 make a master more related to the 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.479
 world of the world but it really impacts 

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:39.159
 mechanics does not take the world the engine 

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:40.550
 social huge car but 

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:42.530
 private 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:44.990
 and then of course, because all the 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.480
 courses and everything you can do that 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.970
 do a little more technicians than you 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.110
 take a theme those that I have not 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.520
 talked about the direction they were going to be 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.740
 pilots should start from 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.480
 young people do not have to, but it's usually 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.090
 so for young people and take courses 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.220
 driving and all that 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.530
 and then I'll say this is a 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:05.320
 thing that I want to go to do 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.390
 enough merit is the school of monlau 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:08.490
 marcelo 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.990
 is a private school that has a 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.880
 driving course a mechanics course 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.050
 of average competition against mechanics 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.070
 of competition because it's the one I 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.080
 I want to go or at least I'm going to 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.500
 try next year not the 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.030
 following 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.460
 this competition mechanics course 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.110
 They are 2 years old as a higher degree but 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.020
 there are several ways to access it you can 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.340
 access only only with the secondary that 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.770
 would continue in those two years that I have 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.240
 commented more a year before initiation 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:32.860
 which is to get contact because as 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.290
 you do not have any superior or middle degree 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.150
 you're supposed to have no idea then you 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:39.210
 they do an initiation course that 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.430
 so it would be three years 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.930
 I said it's private so it's 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.699
 expensive 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.979
 another way to access would be having a 

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:49.720
 middle grade or a higher grade that already 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:51.220
 we would not do in signaling also you 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.750
 you are all years as proof of access 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.529
 of course you have an access test 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:57.139
 to enter because I am 

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:58.669
 has prestige at European level the 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:00.289
 school a lake is important has 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:02.649
 good projection then has a 

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:02.649
 access test 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:08.969
 and the other option to enter is 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:11.400
 with engineering and engineering that arrives 

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:13.050
 a master's degree in competition mechanics and 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.490
 the truth is that it is something more technical not 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.900
 so practical but that also has very 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.720
 good departures 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:20.759
 this of course is scale is not so 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.590
 expensive as the incised your mobile but it is 

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:23.970
 quite expensive has another projection for 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:25.680
 supposed to mobile genre within the 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:27.539
 motor world are different but the 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:29.009
 truth is that I have heard in fact I have 

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:30.600
 Some acquaintance who has done it and has 

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:31.590
 very good projection you can finish very 

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.690
 all right 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:35.460
 and that I know at a Spanish level is what 

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:37.770
 There is surely in every community because 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:40.590
 there will be something there are courses for example 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:42.540
 for expert appraiser of expert doctor of 

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:44.340
 vehicles that is a bit more than the expert 

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:46.170
 hey insurance courses and but 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.450
 mainly that I know in Spain is 

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:50.310
 this what there is any doubt or 

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:51.990
 any suggestion or something what I have 

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:53.580
 wrong times for comment and I 

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:55.440
 I will answer or if I have to do another 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:57.000
 correcting video I will do it if the problem 

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.110
 it comes is that this serves you 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.750
 because for example I had to go back 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:02.280
 crazy because he ended anxiety and does not know 

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:03.810
 what to do I got into engineering then 

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.070
 I discovered the module through a friend 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:06.930
 that is the engineering that I had done 

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:08.940
 in modules to the highest degree forgive me 

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:10.500
 I got to the top grade and now 

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:12.990
 little by little my coach or the mule or 

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:14.610
 and it's a bit like you see and say 

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:18.300
 that you surrender to study and yes 

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:20.400
 happens is because if you do not prepare yourself 

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:22.650
 you're really going to be able to fight with a 

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:24.360
 I prefer to work hard and lose 

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:26.520
 one is to lose the fund studying is not 

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:29.190
 lose but good to waste time 

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:30.900
 studying so that ending 

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:33.000
 working what I like because I do not 

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.500
 I have to work 

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.750
 on the street doing what I like 

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:38.250
 work I think it's going to be better to win 

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:39.570
 money doing something that I like that 

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:41.550
 although in the end one half will be made 

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:43.590
 The room will tire me less than the 

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:46.590
 good are of course I say that 

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:47.940
 it was not that you work if you can 

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:50.430
 house that money and fight for a 

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:52.200
 I dream that if we are always interested in something 

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:54.990
 is the kill yourself study and have a 

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:56.260
 scholarship or family money or there's always 

00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:58.690
 options 

00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:59.860
 and good and I hope you liked the 

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:00.810
 video because that's all I have 

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:02.880
 what to tell you 

00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:05.550
 well that any suggestion comment 

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:07.400
 you leave in the account and I answer 

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:10.150
 charmed 

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.150
 the next
