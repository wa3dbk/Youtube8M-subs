um<00:02:59.760> so<00:03:00.760> I<00:03:01.150> mean<00:03:01.900> it's<00:03:02.140> just<00:03:02.470> a<00:03:02.590> slow<00:03:02.890> as<00:03:03.070> a<00:03:03.100> slug

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
um so I mean it's just a slow as a slug

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:05.340 
um so I mean it's just a slow as a slug
I<00:03:03.940> wouldn't<00:03:04.239> even<00:03:04.330> use<00:03:04.480> it<00:03:04.720> now<00:03:04.810> the<00:03:04.870> netbook

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
I wouldn't even use it now the netbook

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.650 
I wouldn't even use it now the netbook
is<00:03:05.500> meant<00:03:05.709> to<00:03:05.800> be<00:03:05.890> used<00:03:06.070> for<00:03:06.190> email<00:03:06.670> I<00:03:06.940> wouldn't

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
is meant to be used for email I wouldn't

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.800 
is meant to be used for email I wouldn't
even<00:03:07.720> use<00:03:07.870> it<00:03:08.020> for<00:03:08.290> that<00:03:09.090> unless<00:03:10.090> you<00:03:10.300> rely<00:03:10.630> on

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
even use it for that unless you rely on

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.160 
even use it for that unless you rely on
the<00:03:10.959> Sony<00:03:11.200> Playstation<00:03:11.860> like<00:03:12.040> interface

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
the Sony Playstation like interface

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.510 
the Sony Playstation like interface
which<00:03:14.170> I<00:03:14.320> had<00:03:14.440> no<00:03:14.650> opportunity<00:03:14.920> to<00:03:15.250> try

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
which I had no opportunity to try

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.870 
which I had no opportunity to try
because<00:03:15.730> even<00:03:16.060> that<00:03:16.300> was<00:03:16.570> slow<00:03:17.549> the<00:03:18.549> commands

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:18.880 
because even that was slow the commands

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.220 
because even that was slow the commands
just<00:03:19.090> wouldn't<00:03:19.450> register<00:03:19.540> right<00:03:19.989> away<00:03:20.019> I

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
just wouldn't register right away I

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.750 
just wouldn't register right away I
don't<00:03:20.410> know<00:03:20.470> what<00:03:20.620> the<00:03:20.739> story<00:03:20.950> was<00:03:21.070> maybe<00:03:21.489> was

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
don't know what the story was maybe was

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.310 
don't know what the story was maybe was
bogged<00:03:22.030> down<00:03:22.180> with<00:03:22.269> too<00:03:22.540> much<00:03:22.660> demo<00:03:22.930> software

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
bogged down with too much demo software

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:25.680 
bogged down with too much demo software
or<00:03:23.709> something<00:03:23.890> but<00:03:24.820> he<00:03:24.880> was<00:03:25.000> just<00:03:25.209> incredibly

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
or something but he was just incredibly

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.240 
or something but he was just incredibly
slow<00:03:26.019> to<00:03:26.080> the<00:03:26.260> point<00:03:26.500> where<00:03:26.650> I<00:03:26.680> wouldn't<00:03:27.070> even

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
slow to the point where I wouldn't even

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.949 
slow to the point where I wouldn't even
recommend<00:03:27.519> it<00:03:27.820> considering<00:03:28.570> the<00:03:28.690> fact<00:03:28.870> that

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
recommend it considering the fact that

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.170 
recommend it considering the fact that
Sony<00:03:29.260> wants<00:03:29.500> around<00:03:29.799> eight<00:03:29.920> not<00:03:30.160> 800<00:03:30.730> or<00:03:31.000> 900
