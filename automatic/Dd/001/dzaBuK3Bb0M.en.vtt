00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 I have about 400 grams of 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.350
 chicken breast cut into strips 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.240
 I cut and thin strips like this 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.210
 make it easier to do and 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.070
 Gild it but it's take care of you. 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.690
 not cut too thick because otherwise 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.949
 It will take time to cook, okay? 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.740
 the intention here is to make a dish 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:23.250
 fast and you can also replace 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.359
 Why is beef if you want to 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.990
 beef 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.359
 you can make with rump or picanha o 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.520
 kebabs preferably a letter that 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.899
 do not have too much fat you can too 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.340
 cut into strips 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.500
 or if you want you can cut into 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.290
 small cubes, I prefer this way 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.300
 strips but if you want cubes too 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.219
 can but remember not to leave too much 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.530
 great to not take too long 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.539
 Positioning ok then the first step 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.360
 here we are going to season with fineness 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.809
 August Only finance I will not use 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:57.539
 salt because the salt will cause the 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.370
 charlie beck water he asked do not want 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.140
 first I just want to blonde her for later 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.830
 to cook 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:09.540
 so I 'm going to distribute the pepper well 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.100
 Seasoning here and that's it. 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.630
 Now we go in the pot to give a 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.210
 golden in this flesh 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.790
 then that one frying pan I'll put 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.640
 over high heat and I'll put a spoonful of 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:24.270
 margarine soup or salt melt 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:27.540
 margarine and as soon as marina already melts 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.729
 I'm going to put half of this meat 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.530
 I will not put it all because first 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.860
 we are going to donate 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.799
 She dropped it if I put it all away. 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:41.320
 lacking water and first we want 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:43.900
 Lasting process helps meat stay longer 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.210
 tasty and juicy is also the first 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.369
 brown the meat for later 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.680
 Are you part of the cooking process? 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.440
 This helps a lot so here I go 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.490
 let fall whenever stirring golden 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.490
 she does not lack water 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.470
 [Music] 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:08.019
 are side chargers 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:10.649
 now I'm going to become the good I am 

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:10.649
 other side too 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.060
 [Music] 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:23.150
 after arrival a light golden 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.150
 Now I'm going to remove that flesh. 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:33.909
 in the same frying pan over high heat I do not 

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:42.219
 I'll put more margarine in the poop 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:44.590
 rest of the falls will fail with dirt 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:47.370
 It will be very hot here. It will last. 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.370
 faster 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:58.040
 now I'm going to move all the meat to 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:00.920
 a dish the rest of the meat actually 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:04.040
 and now in the same skillet she was 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.780
 on high heat I'll put it on low heat 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.840
 here we are going to improve the seasoning that 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.629
 are two cloves of finely chopped garlic 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:14.659
 two big teeth in the same oil still 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:16.459
 no need to look at people anymore 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:18.829
 It's going to last this year. I'm not using it here. 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:21.230
 onion because I prefer stroganoff only 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:23.720
 seasoned with garlic but if you prefer 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:24.829
 one can put tartá in quantity that 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.720
 you like it 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:29.299
 the onion finely chopped not to stay 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.909
 happy coarse pieces ready and went 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:36.829
 chosen it lasted I'm going to return the 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:38.810
 chicken pieces sampling for 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:41.359
 distribute the whole time in the meat 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.150
 I'm still with the computer. 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:46.579
 put a little salt to taste 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.780
 be careful not to talk too much without 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:50.209
 put the fire down now 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.900
 now I'll put forward three 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:56.690
 spoons of pet shop and you can 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.180
 also be using tomato extracts 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.609
 if you prefer the place has people 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:06.260
 who prefer more ketchup can put 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:07.549
 more if you want - puts - that's the type 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.909
 my pleasure right? 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:14.239
 and I'll put half a tablespoon of 

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:17.449
 mustard to show that I'm using this 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:19.880
 show from here was show of the in grain 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:21.859
 Still , people who live here in Japan are 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.320
 well ok but if you want you can 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:26.570
 use joão's mustard too or else 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.630
 that mustard-based sauce that 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.289
 You are common with those with china can be 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.050
 that he also 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:35.259
 I like 10 grains or distribute 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.259
 on here 

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:41.210
 then certainly a chicken already 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.610
 it's hard to show you 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.939
 that's why that tip of the 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.650
 chicken if cut into strips because 

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:50.449
 he cared very rude and goes 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:54.379
 take a long time to show the kitchen to 

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:57.379
 you're seeing how to prove pj corridinho 

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:58.939
 I put the champignons is that has 50 

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:02.210
 grams of champignon cut into slices 

00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:04.610
 and for a moment I'm going to put out the fire and 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.900
 I'll put a can of sour cream 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.699
 without serum 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:11.300
 if you do not know how to take the dream away from 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:13.610
 cream will appear here underneath 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.169
 It's just you click here Check out this video 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.430
 that you will learn how to 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:17.870
 dream of sour cream 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.759
 I'll still mix with fire 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.199
 turning off whoever wants it to stay 

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:23.120
 more red can put a 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:26.629
 a little more practical and face 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:28.939
 O little more shovel because another woman 

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:31.430
 Now I'll turn the fire back on fire. 

00:05:28.939 --> 00:05:33.439
 down until we warm up this 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.930
 milk is not to boil 

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:38.449
 because otherwise it italy then we just 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:40.520
 It's going to warm him up and I like 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:43.069
 estrogonofe just a little bit more 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:46.460
 thick even if you prefer one 

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:49.669
 little more is liquid sauce is just you 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:52.610

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:55.460
 milk and you adding and mixing 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:57.589
 function agreement with your taste to find 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:00.009
 that separating the two without minutinhos 

00:05:57.589 --> 00:06:00.009

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:22.240
 small pieces that you have round or 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:32.770
 help the presence and no one 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:34.770
