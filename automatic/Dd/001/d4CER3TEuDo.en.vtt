00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
entire time so they really didn't have

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.800 
entire time so they really didn't have
much<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.920> ball<00:00:26.130> Italy<00:00:27.090> really<00:00:27.480> played

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
much of the ball Italy really played

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.080 
much of the ball Italy really played
with<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.230> ball<00:00:28.410> pretty<00:00:29.220> nicely<00:00:29.609> but<00:00:30.000> they

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
with the ball pretty nicely but they

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.359 
with the ball pretty nicely but they
really<00:00:30.330> didn't<00:00:30.539> get<00:00:30.660> as<00:00:30.810> many<00:00:31.080> great<00:00:31.980> chances

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.310 
really didn't get as many great chances
as<00:00:32.550> they<00:00:32.640> should<00:00:32.700> have<00:00:32.910> they<00:00:33.540> had<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:33.989> lot<00:00:34.290> of

as they should have they had a lot of
the<00:00:34.469> ball<00:00:34.649> but<00:00:34.950> they<00:00:35.790> certainly<00:00:36.149> had<00:00:36.570> the

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
the ball but they certainly had the

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.440 
the ball but they certainly had the
chance<00:00:37.020> his<00:00:37.260> Balotelli<00:00:37.829> had<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.190> ball<00:00:38.450> right

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450
