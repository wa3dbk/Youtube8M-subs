00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:48.349 
site and it turned out all right I just

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:49.809 
site and it turned out all right I just
kept<00:03:48.530> on<00:03:48.620> plugging<00:03:49.069> them<00:03:49.219> and<00:03:49.430> make<00:03:49.579> sure<00:03:49.700> your

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
kept on plugging them and make sure your

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:53.140 
kept on plugging them and make sure your
lines<00:03:49.999> are<00:03:50.269> vertically<00:03:51.549> straight<00:03:52.549> that

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
lines are vertically straight that

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.170 
lines are vertically straight that
they're<00:03:53.329> not<00:03:53.769> if<00:03:54.769> not<00:03:55.040> then<00:03:55.250> they<00:03:55.519> look<00:03:55.819> much

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
they're not if not then they look much

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.189 
they're not if not then they look much
more<00:03:57.250> much<00:03:58.250> more<00:03:58.870> rough

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:00.199 
more much more rough

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:02.439 
more much more rough
I<00:04:00.230> mean<00:04:00.620> any<00:04:00.799> shape<00:04:01.069> or<00:04:01.219> sizes<00:04:01.489> this<00:04:02.209> one<00:04:02.419> I

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:02.449 
I mean any shape or sizes this one I

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:04.689 
I mean any shape or sizes this one I
mean<00:04:02.780> and<00:04:03.019> it's<00:04:03.169> pretty<00:04:03.469> big<00:04:03.739> so<00:04:03.769> it's<00:04:04.310> very

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:04.699 
mean and it's pretty big so it's very

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:07.750 
mean and it's pretty big so it's very
very<00:04:04.969> rubbed<00:04:05.359> on<00:04:05.989> me<00:04:06.199> but<00:04:06.739> for<00:04:07.069> the<00:04:07.280> small<00:04:07.519> ones

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
very rubbed on me but for the small ones

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.439 
very rubbed on me but for the small ones
I<00:04:07.909> made<00:04:08.090> because<00:04:08.500> they<00:04:09.500> are<00:04:09.680> more<00:04:10.120> in<00:04:11.120> shape

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:11.449 
I made because they are more in shape

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:14.860 
I made because they are more in shape
and<00:04:11.980> it's<00:04:12.980> just<00:04:13.129> how<00:04:13.219> you<00:04:13.250> do<00:04:13.430> it<00:04:13.629> remember<00:04:14.629> to

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
and it's just how you do it remember to

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.550 
and it's just how you do it remember to
start<00:04:15.109> from<00:04:15.319> a<00:04:15.530> small<00:04:15.949> little<00:04:16.870> illness<00:04:17.870> notice

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
start from a small little illness notice

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.249 
start from a small little illness notice
that's<00:04:18.739> small<00:04:19.190> because<00:04:19.669> you<00:04:20.229> want<00:04:21.229> to

00:04:21.249 --> 00:04:21.259 
that's small because you want to

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:22.719 
that's small because you want to
familiarize<00:04:21.769> yourself<00:04:22.250> with<00:04:22.280> it<00:04:22.400> first

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:22.729 
familiarize yourself with it first

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:24.999 
familiarize yourself with it first
before<00:04:23.120> you<00:04:23.360> make<00:04:23.660> bigger<00:04:24.020> ones<00:04:24.139> just<00:04:24.710> in<00:04:24.860> case

00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:25.009 
before you make bigger ones just in case

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:27.969 
before you make bigger ones just in case
