 Day I was lying there and nothing in today 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.950
 day mac will give you some recipes 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.219
 the rumored kitchen with apple chocolate 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:19.109
 to tinker without board worldmusic puzzle 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:21.270
 and a phone for flexible the iphone 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.920
 5 it's only been a few months 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.689
 the market and already rank new ones 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.730
 adventurous myths around the iphone 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:31.769
 number six or five em or zb abc 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.899
 xy or whatever that may mean 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.430
 In any case, it should be bigger and thinner 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.630
 and we are we have you ever 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.300
 a prototype 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.120
 According to rumors, the new iphone 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.710
 a complete display with it 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.719
 patents in the absence of apple in any case 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.860
 there are no plans for a solar 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.719
 location and 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.010
 motion detection an innovative 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.020
 display frame for even more 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.239
 notifications and a built-in 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.579
 mini line so a small 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:01.829
 light field camera and can fly our 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:12.689
 by the way, iphone prototype also or 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:13.729
 not already chocolate 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.590
 technology in it 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.450
 The wonderful looks like chocolate 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.130
 but is a sensor kit 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.869
 consisting of one main and six 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.360
 sensor modules with integrated wifi 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.830
 bluetooth and his own battery he is for 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.659
 the new generation of app developers 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.490
 thought the hardware actually 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.439
 have nothing on the hat but to test 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.420
 their innovative home appliances apps 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.530
 only times such hardware need it 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.490
 the wonderful maybe in the 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.490
 are city cellar 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.440
 he knows partie plays a partie 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.270
 Chess and suddenly yours is 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.740
 opposite on familiar and aggressive 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.290
 organes chants how good that is 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.270
 court has passed with the boxee box 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.450
 something not because the puts everything 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.830
 as a hologram evil space and the 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.690
 Technology behind it is not like that 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.030
 complicated in the boxee box sits 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.380
 Projector taking a picture on a plane 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.210
 which in turn will be high 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.680
 speed up and down so vibrates 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.660
 that a three-dimensional projection 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.290
 arises from all sides 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.820
 can be 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.410
 would actually occur to me 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.940
 but can not care 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.100
 soon the boxee box is supposed to be too 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.390
 be set up in shopping malls where 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:20.390
 still too expensive for the home 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:22.370
 Pity world music is world music 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.290
 world music because who with the whole world 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.210
 Playing in a band is by definition 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.730
 world musician of the world makes music or 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.620
 no i do not talk garbage the world band 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.840
 really exists and as something 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.180
 otherwise gold band will get you and 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.160
 combines old fashioned virtual old ones 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.930
 professionals hunt with talented newcomers 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.280
 and then it works like someone 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.739
 makes a well-rehearsed about the app 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.750
 trek online no matter if it's a drumset or 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.580
 also vocals other musicians can then 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.260
 put your own tracks over it and 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.820
 Upload stars like the rolling stones 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.820
 or passengers and also with us 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.660
 at best, it will be a huge hit 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.000
 and you deserve his song 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.220
 heap of coal I would have but the 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:34.310
 Maybe someone wrong somebody 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:37.370
 state stiffer you are looking forward to google 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:40.220
 tomorrow's snow of the day after tomorrow 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.810
 however, google smart lenz is that 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.060
 is a lens with a tiny one 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.859
 sensors earth you share in the share price 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.079
 can determine tear fluid and with 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:50.269
 an even smaller wlan chip then 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:53.180
 these data will send directly to smartphone 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:54.799
 broke sounds like crazy or is it 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.900
 this clever lens allows 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:58.340
 diabetics to test the insulin levels 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.209
 without getting constantly in the finger 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.069
 to have pixel 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:08.870
 And who knows what else in five years' time 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:10.400
 is possible so that 's it with the technology 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.660
 for today if you like the video 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.940
 has then let a thumb there 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.010
 you can find two more videos below and 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.209
 You can subscribe to the channel here and
