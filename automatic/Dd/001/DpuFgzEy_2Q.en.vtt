is<00:04:03.580> that<00:04:04.060> when<00:04:04.239> I<00:04:04.269> received<00:04:04.750> it<00:04:04.930> it<00:04:05.140> just<00:04:05.410> had<00:04:05.650> a

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
is that when I received it it just had a

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.979 
is that when I received it it just had a
little<00:04:05.950> residue<00:04:06.459> on<00:04:06.610> the<00:04:06.730> color<00:04:06.940> but<00:04:07.840> I

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
little residue on the color but I

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:10.470 
little residue on the color but I
believe<00:04:08.830> that<00:04:09.190> that<00:04:09.370> is<00:04:09.519> just<00:04:09.550> from<00:04:10.030> the

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
believe that that is just from the

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.839 
believe that that is just from the
coloring<00:04:11.080> and<00:04:11.470> everything<00:04:11.830> else<00:04:12.430> because

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:12.849 
coloring and everything else because

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:14.850 
coloring and everything else because
everything<00:04:13.390> else<00:04:13.659> was<00:04:13.870> perfect

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
everything else was perfect

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.729 
everything else was perfect
