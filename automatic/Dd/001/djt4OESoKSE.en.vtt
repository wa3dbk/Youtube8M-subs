anyways I don't care you know I'm an
early<00:00:49.170> adopter<00:00:49.500> I<00:00:49.800> wanted<00:00:50.489> to<00:00:50.579> add<00:00:50.640> give<00:00:50.850> the

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
early adopter I wanted to add give the

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.189 
early adopter I wanted to add give the
system<00:00:51.360> because<00:00:51.510> I've<00:00:51.600> always<00:00:51.750> been<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.960> fan<00:00:52.020> of

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
system because I've always been a fan of

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.119 
system because I've always been a fan of
Sony<00:00:52.910> so<00:00:53.910> I<00:00:54.270> don't<00:00:54.750> mind<00:00:54.960> having<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.800> paid

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
Sony so I don't mind having that paid

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.209 
Sony so I don't mind having that paid
the<00:00:56.399> extra<00:00:56.820> amount<00:00:57.590> plus<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:58.770> can't<00:00:58.980> get<00:00:59.129> the

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
the extra amount plus you can't get the

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.950 
the extra amount plus you can't get the
6<00:00:59.430> gigabyte<00:00:59.850> version<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.449> it's<00:01:00.570> backwards

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
6 gigabyte version and it's backwards

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.540 
6 gigabyte version and it's backwards
compatible<00:01:01.500> so<00:01:01.739> that's<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.190> nice<00:01:02.340> feature

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
compatible so that's a nice feature

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.219 
compatible so that's a nice feature
first<00:01:03.390> of<00:01:03.570> all<00:01:03.629> gran<00:01:04.589> turismo<00:01:04.860> 5<00:01:05.400> prologue<00:01:06.229> a

it's you know a great example of what

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.810 
it's you know a great example of what
the<00:01:12.150> PlayStation<00:01:12.750> 3<00:01:12.930> is<00:01:13.049> capable<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.710> but<00:01:14.640> this

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
the PlayStation 3 is capable of but this

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.280 
the PlayStation 3 is capable of but this
is<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.030> type<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.240> game<00:01:15.479> that<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:15.750> either<00:01:15.810> you're

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
racing so then you're probably not going

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.760 
racing so then you're probably not going

that<00:01:25.920> in<00:01:26.070> mind<00:01:26.250> if<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:26.549> plan<00:01:26.790> on<00:01:26.939> picking<00:01:27.119> this

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
that in mind if you plan on picking this

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.510

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
from a lot of people mostly due to the

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.960 
from a lot of people mostly due to the
control<00:02:23.750> scheme<00:02:24.310> which<00:02:25.310> they've<00:02:25.549> recently

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
control scheme which they've recently

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.600 
control scheme which they've recently
patched<00:02:26.269> and<00:02:26.720> they<00:02:27.680> have<00:02:27.920> you<00:02:28.340> know<00:02:28.370> the

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
patched and they have you know the

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.400 
patched and they have you know the
ability<00:02:29.209> now<00:02:29.390> to<00:02:29.420> actually<00:02:29.780> use<00:02:30.110> the<00:02:30.319> analog

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
ability now to actually use the analog

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.699 
ability now to actually use the analog
sticks<00:02:31.010> before<00:02:31.610> it<00:02:32.030> was<00:02:32.090> all<00:02:32.269> six<00:02:32.569> axis<00:02:33.049> but<00:02:33.470> i

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
sticks before it was all six axis but i

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.979 
sticks before it was all six axis but i
personally<00:02:34.190> like<00:02:34.519> the<00:02:34.670> sixaxis<00:02:35.030> control<00:02:35.750> I

00:02:35.979 --> 00:02:35.989 
personally like the sixaxis control I

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.440 
personally like the sixaxis control I
think<00:02:36.590> the<00:02:36.709> graphic<00:02:37.640> wise<00:02:37.819> the<00:02:38.239> game's

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
think the graphic wise the game's

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.650 
think the graphic wise the game's
beautiful<00:02:39.310> and<00:02:40.310> gameplay<00:02:41.180> I<00:02:41.209> thought<00:02:41.510> it<00:02:41.599> was

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
beautiful and gameplay I thought it was

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.050 
beautiful and gameplay I thought it was
pretty<00:02:41.870> fun<00:02:42.230> but<00:02:42.470> I<00:02:43.040> can<00:02:43.519> definitely<00:02:43.640> see

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
pretty fun but I can definitely see

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.729 
pretty fun but I can definitely see
where<00:02:44.239> some<00:02:44.480> people<00:02:44.540> wouldn't<00:02:45.140> enjoy<00:02:45.440> it<00:02:45.470> and

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
where some people wouldn't enjoy it and

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:47.800 
where some people wouldn't enjoy it and
where<00:02:46.640> some<00:02:47.030> people<00:02:47.060> would<00:02:47.329> think<00:02:47.450> that<00:02:47.569> was

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
where some people would think that was

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.789 
where some people would think that was
kind<00:02:47.989> of<00:02:48.019> flawed<00:02:49.120> next<00:02:50.120> game<00:02:50.299> is<00:02:50.500> MLB<00:02:51.500> 08<00:02:51.650> the

kind of flawed next game is MLB 08 the

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:53.920 
kind of flawed next game is MLB 08 the

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:21.049 
this game a lot graphics graphic wise I

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:21.910 
this game a lot graphics graphic wise I
thought<00:03:21.230> it<00:03:21.349> could<00:03:21.440> be<00:03:21.470> a<00:03:21.530> little<00:03:21.680> bit<00:03:21.829> better

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
thought it could be a little bit better

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.030 
thought it could be a little bit better
but<00:03:22.190> I<00:03:22.609> think<00:03:22.940> it<00:03:23.030> really<00:03:23.060> did<00:03:23.450> the<00:03:23.540> job<00:03:24.040> next

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
but I think it really did the job next

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.129 
but I think it really did the job next
game<00:03:25.160> is<00:03:25.220> motorstorm<00:03:25.940> motorstorm<00:03:26.870> is<00:03:26.930> a<00:03:26.959> fun

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
game really cool arcade racing game but

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.830 
game really cool arcade racing game but
it<00:03:29.870> doesn't<00:03:30.430> have<00:03:31.450> some<00:03:32.450> of<00:03:32.510> the<00:03:32.569> forgive

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
it doesn't have some of the forgive

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.460 
it doesn't have some of the forgive
ability<00:03:33.200> of<00:03:33.319> games<00:03:33.980> like<00:03:34.130> a<00:03:34.639> burnout<00:03:35.630> or<00:03:35.660> some

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470

of the other arcade racing games this is

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.420 
of the other arcade racing games this is
a<00:03:38.150> little<00:03:38.480> bit<00:03:38.599> harder<00:03:39.049> yet<00:03:39.950> to<00:03:40.099> find<00:03:40.310> the

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
a little bit harder yet to find the

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:41.589 
a little bit harder yet to find the
