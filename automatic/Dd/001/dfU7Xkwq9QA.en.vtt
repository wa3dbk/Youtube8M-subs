00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:19.619
 In a game you can often find situations in which you 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.730
 you come face to face with a striker is one of the most 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.130
 dangerous you can find 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.050
 since the minimum contact with the opponent can cause a penalty 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.780
 that's why in this chapter you will discover how to intervene on the 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.809
 ball through a destination block because ChÃ¡vez 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.200
 when the attacker advances with the ball controlled the attacker has taken advantage 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.700
 about the defenders 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.700
 and caused a direct confrontation 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.420
 when the ball is divided 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.440
 after a pass into space between the goalkeeper and the defensive line 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.030
 the goalkeeper and the attacker struggle to reach a ball without an owner 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.320
 but is to find yourself with respect to the attacker as close as possible to 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.040
 reduce 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.689
 cid to the maximum the angle of shot for which 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.430
 a fast and determined displacement to bbc towards the ball 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.120
 to achieve little intercept rotate the action little over when intervening are the 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.120
 ball by means of a specific type gesture 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.890
 hold 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.530
 until the last moment without getting tired 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.000
 inviting the player with the arteaga ball the first movement 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.930
 keep the center of gravity low 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.830
 with legs and arms in semis the action to await balance and 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.970
 can react quickly 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.220
 you must take advantage of the moment when the player lowers his head towards the ball and 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.720
 This is separated from the player's foot 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.780
 rod in diagonally stretched so the ball is done with it places the arms and the 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.359
 trunk forward 

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:13.339
 uses the body as a barrier 

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:16.849
 advance the deadlines to be able to use local elections 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:29.439
 if the attacker stops, you also stop, so always keep the bisector 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:32.679
 covering the angle of shot 

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:37.189
 If he decides to continue like this, the player will give him the initiative 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:41.149
 displacement you can lose the proper position to stop the ball 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.610
 if it attacks on one side 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.630
 you must keep it down without losing the bisector 

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:12.399
 if the attacker is a farm or changes his address 

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:16.749
 you must be accompanied by how the body making coverage as the goal of 

00:03:16.749 --> 00:03:17.890
 gain ground 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.890
 close the angle of shot 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:32.209
 if the attacker separates you must get close in front 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:37.369
 short without losing basic body position to close some witnesses 

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:38.800
 hold the position 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.050
 as much as possible check the trajectory of the ball at all times 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.050
 consider the attacker's skillful leg 

00:03:49.119 --> 00:03:52.370
 when the distance between the attacker and the goalkeeper is short 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:53.209
 you look 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.420
 fulfilled the maximum space counted corporal position covering the 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.420
 trajectory of the ball and the shooting angle of the attacker 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.189
 use the position of 

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:08.279
 passed by used since it will be the most effective in providing a surface 

00:04:08.279 --> 00:04:11.279
 of position May 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:19.209
 place yourself as the bisector or regarding the possessor of the ball without in carahue 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.539
 this appointment to place pinky position yourself correctly according to the 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:24.309
 situation 

00:04:24.309 --> 00:04:27.309
 1 the possible receiver of the pass 

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:33.759
 in this situation in which he struggles with the striker to reach a ball without 

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:39.150
 owner is important that I advance you to be a shareholder in the decision drawer 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.199
 the forward if he arrives earlier 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:42.930
 will turn reason 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:47.770
 for this reason you must lower the center of gravity in the race and decide the type 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.849
 of action that you are going to perform 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:52.039
 frustrated step position 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:57.080
 deviated with the foot oj deflected with the hand and the ball came a trajectory 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.080
 lateral for respect to your position 

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:06.509
 the striker if he arrives before he will make a high juntero above the position 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:09.839
 of the goalkeeper so at the start you must 

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:13.909
 raise your arms and jump up and so on the ball 

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:18.770
 and try to cover the maximum possible angle to keep the whole body and about 

00:05:18.769 --> 00:05:23.030
 all the hands in tension to have greater effectiveness in the rejection 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:28.930
 it is clear that everything is solved if you anticipate and move away villegas decision 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.809
 before the front 

00:05:30.809 --> 00:05:35.289
 we have contemplated the opposite possibility in cases where it arrives 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:36.299
 before the player
