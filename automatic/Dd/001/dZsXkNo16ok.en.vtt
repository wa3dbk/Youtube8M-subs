00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
we are using the new technique where you

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.380 
we are using the new technique where you
get<00:00:38.340> your<00:00:38.460> team<00:00:38.670> ready<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:39.000> check<00:00:39.149> the<00:00:39.239> care

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
packages and when they land on you it

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.310 
packages and when they land on you it
