00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
the best thing to do is when you start

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.780 
the best thing to do is when you start
the<00:00:49.440> bottom<00:00:49.559> run<00:00:49.829> straight<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.610> balcony

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:50.790

you<00:00:53.820> up<00:00:53.939> in<00:00:54.089> the<00:00:54.180> balcony<00:00:54.210> shoot<00:00:54.720> him<00:00:54.869> as<00:00:55.049> you

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
you up in the balcony shoot him as you

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.590 
you up in the balcony shoot him as you
can<00:00:55.290> see<00:00:55.470> there<00:00:55.710> we<00:00:55.949> both<00:00:56.549> saw<00:00:56.790> him<00:00:56.939> but<00:00:57.420> if<00:00:57.510> you

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
can see there we both saw him but if you

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.030 
can see there we both saw him but if you
can<00:00:57.750> see<00:00:58.049> you<00:00:58.229> if<00:00:58.350> he<00:00:58.470> knows<00:00:58.650> you're<00:00:58.860> there

00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.040 
can see you if he knows you're there

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.649 
can see you if he knows you're there
then<00:00:59.250> he's<00:00:59.369> going<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.549> dodge<00:00:59.760> it<00:00:59.790> and<00:01:00.210> he

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:00.659 
then he's going to dodge it and he

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:02.090 
then he's going to dodge it and he
dodges<00:01:01.019> them<00:01:01.140> pretty<00:01:01.350> well<00:01:01.439> wish<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:01.830> can<00:01:01.920> see

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
dodges them pretty well wish you can see

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.369 
dodges them pretty well wish you can see
he's<00:01:02.189> got<00:01:02.309> some<00:01:02.460> groovy<00:01:02.699> moves<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:03.229> think<00:01:04.229> it

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
he's got some groovy moves I think it

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.230 
he's got some groovy moves I think it
takes<00:01:04.530> about<00:01:04.710> eight<00:01:05.220> hits<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.700> hit<00:01:05.729> him<00:01:05.880> and

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
takes about eight hits to hit him and

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.730 
takes about eight hits to hit him and
that's<00:01:06.900> only<00:01:07.020> because<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.320> got<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.530> hang

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
that's only because I got the hang

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.580 
that's only because I got the hang
cannon<00:01:08.009> no<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.520> unlimited<00:01:09.180> ammo<00:01:09.750> so<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.470> don't

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
cannon no and unlimited ammo so I don't

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.990 
cannon no and unlimited ammo so I don't
know<00:01:10.920> what<00:01:11.100> do<00:01:11.729> with<00:01:11.909> other<00:01:12.180> weapons<00:01:12.600> maybe

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
know what do with other weapons maybe

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.580 
know what do with other weapons maybe
