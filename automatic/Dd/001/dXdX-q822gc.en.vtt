the right okay this is left side view
gonna<00:01:13.729> do<00:01:13.970> an<00:01:14.300> elevation<00:01:14.930> for<00:01:15.229> you<00:01:15.460> and<00:01:16.460> you

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.790 
gonna do an elevation for you and you
can<00:01:16.760> see<00:01:16.940> there's<00:01:17.119> about<00:01:17.360> what<00:01:17.810> 3/4<00:01:18.590> of<00:01:18.680> an

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
can see there's about what 3/4 of an

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.340 
can see there's about what 3/4 of an
inch<00:01:18.920> of<00:01:19.130> the<00:01:19.190> gap<00:01:19.400> in<00:01:19.729> between<00:01:19.820> the<00:01:20.300> pan<00:01:21.020> and

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
inch of the gap in between the pan and

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.250 
inch of the gap in between the pan and
that<00:01:21.760> flat<00:01:22.760> pad<00:01:23.119> there<00:01:23.420> I<00:01:23.450> guess<00:01:23.810> you<00:01:24.080> could

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
that flat pad there I guess you could

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.190 
that flat pad there I guess you could
fall<00:01:24.470> it<00:01:25.210> and<00:01:26.210> I<00:01:26.450> think<00:01:26.630> I'm<00:01:26.720> just<00:01:26.840> gonna<00:01:26.960> raise

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
fall it and I think I'm just gonna raise

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.740 
fall it and I think I'm just gonna raise
it<00:01:27.229> about<00:01:27.560> six<00:01:27.800> inches<00:01:28.160> here<00:01:28.340> or<00:01:28.490> so<00:01:28.700> and<00:01:29.420> stop

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
it about six inches here or so and stop

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.680 
it about six inches here or so and stop
and<00:01:29.930> then<00:01:29.990> I'll<00:01:30.110> end<00:01:30.200> up<00:01:30.380> going<00:01:30.650> back<00:01:30.860> down

and again this is the front or the right

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:59.789 
and again this is the front or the right
side<00:02:51.340> here<00:02:57.599> okay<00:02:58.599> when<00:02:59.019> it<00:02:59.110> comes<00:02:59.319> to<00:02:59.470> the<00:02:59.590> late

00:02:59.789 --> 00:02:59.799 
side here okay when it comes to the late

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:03.509 
side here okay when it comes to the late
risers<00:03:00.310> I<00:03:01.349> always<00:03:02.349> felt<00:03:02.590> like<00:03:02.709> they<00:03:02.890> they<00:03:03.459> were

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
risers I always felt like they they were

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.850 
risers I always felt like they they were
kind<00:03:03.849> of<00:03:03.940> off<00:03:04.120> and<00:03:05.110> if<00:03:05.260> you<00:03:05.290> look<00:03:05.500> at<00:03:05.650> them<00:03:05.769> they

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
kind of off and if you look at them they

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.440 
kind of off and if you look at them they
are<00:03:05.890> off<00:03:06.190> a<00:03:06.220> little<00:03:06.489> bit<00:03:06.670> but<00:03:06.849> you'd<00:03:07.030> see<00:03:07.269> even

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
are off a little bit but you'd see even

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:08.699 
are off a little bit but you'd see even
more<00:03:07.599> noticeable<00:03:07.780> when<00:03:08.230> they<00:03:08.290> go<00:03:08.470> well<00:03:08.680> right

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
more noticeable when they go well right

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.410 
more noticeable when they go well right
they<00:03:08.980> you<00:03:09.040> can<00:03:09.250> see<00:03:09.459> ones<00:03:09.700> farther<00:03:10.000> back<00:03:10.209> from

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
they you can see ones farther back from

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.670 
they you can see ones farther back from
the<00:03:10.510> other<00:03:10.659> and<00:03:10.930> they<00:03:11.110> are<00:03:11.140> fully<00:03:11.799> back<00:03:12.780> and<00:03:13.780> as

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
the other and they are fully back and as

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.890 
the other and they are fully back and as
I<00:03:15.340> come<00:03:15.549> up<00:03:15.579> it<00:03:15.909> looks<00:03:16.090> like<00:03:16.239> the<00:03:16.420> right<00:03:16.569> side

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
I come up it looks like the right side

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.059 
I come up it looks like the right side
is<00:03:17.319> lower<00:03:18.329> than<00:03:19.329> the<00:03:19.690> left<00:03:19.900> side<00:03:20.109> but<00:03:20.799> they're

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
is lower than the left side but they're

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.589 
is lower than the left side but they're
mounted<00:03:21.519> in<00:03:21.730> the<00:03:21.909> same<00:03:22.150> holes<00:03:22.480> on<00:03:22.810> each<00:03:23.019> side

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 
mounted in the same holes on each side

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:27.390 
mounted in the same holes on each side
so<00:03:25.599> somewhere<00:03:26.230> in<00:03:26.290> the<00:03:26.560> legs<00:03:26.769> or<00:03:27.040> something

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
so somewhere in the legs or something

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.690 
so somewhere in the legs or something
wrong<00:03:27.549> there<00:03:27.760> too<00:03:29.340> not<00:03:30.340> enough<00:03:30.579> that's

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
wrong there too not enough that's

my<00:03:38.709> daughter's<00:03:39.040> taking<00:03:39.370> this<00:03:39.459> this<00:03:39.970> shot<00:03:40.750> and

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
my daughter's taking this this shot and

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.210 
my daughter's taking this this shot and
the<00:03:42.870> camera<00:03:43.870> view<00:03:43.900> she<00:03:44.200> has<00:03:44.319> the<00:03:44.500> chemical<00:03:44.739> tit

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
the camera view she has the chemical tit

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.580 
the camera view she has the chemical tit
to<00:03:45.370> the<00:03:45.459> left<00:03:45.700> just<00:03:45.849> a<00:03:45.940> little<00:03:45.970> bit<00:03:46.269> so<00:03:46.480> it<00:03:47.409> does

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
to the left just a little bit so it does

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.910 
to the left just a little bit so it does
exaggerate<00:03:48.220> the<00:03:48.370> tilt<00:03:48.639> a<00:03:48.760> little<00:03:48.790> bit<00:03:49.180> and

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
exaggerate the tilt a little bit and

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.900 
exaggerate the tilt a little bit and
obviously<00:03:50.920> I<00:03:50.950> couldn't<00:03:51.250> see<00:03:51.459> what<00:03:51.549> she<00:03:51.760> was

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.009 
obviously I couldn't see what she was
doing<00:03:52.209> so<00:03:52.829> this<00:03:53.829> is<00:03:54.040> the<00:03:54.190> shall<00:03:54.400> we<00:03:54.579> get<00:03:55.019> but
