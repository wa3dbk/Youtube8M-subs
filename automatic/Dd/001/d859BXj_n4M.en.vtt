the<00:01:45.000> wrong<00:01:45.119> way<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.600> guess<00:01:45.750> technically<00:01:46.079> I'm

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
the wrong way I guess technically I'm

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.050

going<00:01:46.439> from<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.829> end<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.490> beginning<00:01:47.610> but

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
going from the end to the beginning but

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.510 
going from the end to the beginning but
yeah<00:01:48.299> it's<00:01:48.540> just<00:01:48.659> easier<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.930> flip<00:01:49.079> this<00:01:49.229> way

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520
