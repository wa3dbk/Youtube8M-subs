00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:03.919 

in<00:00:02.730> this<00:00:02.879> video<00:00:03.210> I'm<00:00:03.480> going<00:00:03.600> to<00:00:03.689> demonstrate

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
in this video I'm going to demonstrate

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.909 
in this video I'm going to demonstrate
how<00:00:04.529> to<00:00:04.560> measure<00:00:04.799> crankshaft<00:00:05.580> run<00:00:06.060> out<00:00:06.270> and<00:00:06.919> I

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
how to measure crankshaft run out and I

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.669 
how to measure crankshaft run out and I
can<00:00:08.250> do<00:00:08.429> this<00:00:08.670> using<00:00:08.970> the<00:00:09.179> block<00:00:09.450> you<00:00:10.349> can<00:00:10.469> do

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
can do this using the block you can do

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.680 
can do this using the block you can do
it<00:00:10.800> using<00:00:11.010> V<00:00:11.490> blocks<00:00:11.820> but<00:00:12.240> for<00:00:12.570> this

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
it using V blocks but for this

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.390 
it using V blocks but for this
demonstration<00:00:12.929> I'm<00:00:13.769> going<00:00:13.830> to<00:00:13.950> do<00:00:14.099> it<00:00:14.190> in<00:00:14.280> the

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
demonstration I'm going to do it in the

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.250 
demonstration I'm going to do it in the
block<00:00:14.610> because<00:00:14.910> I<00:00:14.940> don't<00:00:15.150> have<00:00:15.360> V<00:00:15.660> blocks<00:00:15.960> be

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
block because I don't have V blocks be

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.370 
block because I don't have V blocks be
enough<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:16.710> fit<00:00:16.920> this<00:00:17.100> crank<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:18.170> you<00:00:19.170> may

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
enough to fit this crank and you may

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.349 
enough to fit this crank and you may
notice<00:00:19.680> I've<00:00:20.010> taken<00:00:20.250> all<00:00:20.640> of<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:21.060> main

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
notice I've taken all of the main

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.380 
notice I've taken all of the main
bearings<00:00:21.779> out<00:00:22.140> of<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.529> block<00:00:22.880> except<00:00:23.880> for<00:00:24.180> the

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
bearings out of the block except for the

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.410 
bearings out of the block except for the
front<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.080> rear<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.650> that<00:00:26.580> way<00:00:26.789> if<00:00:27.180> this

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
front and the rear and that way if this

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.689 
front and the rear and that way if this
crankshaft<00:00:28.019> has<00:00:28.170> any<00:00:28.500> run-out<00:00:29.160> which<00:00:29.460> is

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
crankshaft has any run-out which is

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.089 
crankshaft has any run-out which is
meaning<00:00:30.570> that<00:00:30.689> it<00:00:30.810> will<00:00:30.900> wobble<00:00:31.109> up<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.920> down

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
meaning that it will wobble up and down

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.360 
meaning that it will wobble up and down
in<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.489> middle<00:00:32.759> that<00:00:33.320> if<00:00:34.320> it<00:00:34.530> has<00:00:34.770> any<00:00:35.070> of<00:00:35.190> that

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
in the middle that if it has any of that

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.389 
in the middle that if it has any of that
run-out<00:00:36.050> the<00:00:37.050> lack<00:00:37.290> of<00:00:37.320> these<00:00:37.710> bearings<00:00:38.129> being

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
run-out the lack of these bearings being

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.510 
run-out the lack of these bearings being
here<00:00:38.640> will<00:00:38.820> allow<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.300> Waddle<00:00:39.629> up<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:39.899> down<00:00:43.520> so

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
here will allow to Waddle up and down so

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:51.549 
here will allow to Waddle up and down so
the<00:00:44.670> first<00:00:44.969> thing<00:00:45.300> is<00:00:46.170> install<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.890> crank<00:00:47.340> and

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:54.110 

what<00:00:52.559> we're<00:00:52.710> checking<00:00:52.980> for<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.460> movement<00:00:53.940> up

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
what we're checking for is movement up

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.020 
what we're checking for is movement up
and<00:00:54.300> down<00:00:54.480> on<00:00:54.750> this<00:00:55.140> centre<00:00:55.530> journal<00:00:56.030> we're

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
and down on this centre journal we're

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:04.210 
and down on this centre journal we're
going<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.210> do<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.539> with<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.750> dial<00:00:58.020> indicator

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.570 

some<00:01:05.220> magnetic<00:01:05.640> base<00:01:06.000> dial<00:01:06.420> indicator<00:01:07.580> and

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
some magnetic base dial indicator and

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:15.230 
some magnetic base dial indicator and
I've<00:01:08.700> set<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.000> up<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:10.189> on<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:12.090> dial<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:14.240> can

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
I've set it up and on the dial you can

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.520 
I've set it up and on the dial you can
either<00:01:15.659> zero<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:17.780> or<00:01:19.880> yep<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.810> can<00:01:21.960> zero<00:01:22.350> the

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
either zero it or yep you can zero the

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.500 
either zero it or yep you can zero the
dowel

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:25.510 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.720 

to<00:01:26.320> get<00:01:26.500> it<00:01:26.620> set<00:01:26.890> to<00:01:26.920> zero<00:01:27.460> and<00:01:27.960> then<00:01:29.700> spin<00:01:30.700> the

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:30.730 
to get it set to zero and then spin the

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.560 
to get it set to zero and then spin the
crankshaft<00:01:31.450> and<00:01:31.750> the<00:01:32.520> speck<00:01:33.520> on<00:01:33.760> this<00:01:34.000> engine

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
crankshaft and the speck on this engine

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.380 
crankshaft and the speck on this engine
is<00:01:34.690> two<00:01:34.960> thousandths<00:01:35.650> of<00:01:35.740> an<00:01:35.890> inch<00:01:36.040> and<00:01:36.610> the

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
is two thousandths of an inch and the

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.470 
is two thousandths of an inch and the
needle<00:01:37.750> is<00:01:37.870> barely<00:01:38.320> moving<00:01:38.680> at<00:01:38.980> all

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:39.480 
needle is barely moving at all

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.900 
needle is barely moving at all
so<00:01:40.480> this<00:01:40.690> crankshaft<00:01:41.320> has<00:01:41.640> very<00:01:42.640> little

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
so this crankshaft has very little

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.850 
so this crankshaft has very little
run-out<00:01:43.630> not<00:01:43.900> enough<00:01:44.170> that<00:01:44.350> I<00:01:44.500> can<00:01:44.650> even

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
run-out not enough that I can even

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.250 
run-out not enough that I can even
measure<00:01:45.040> it<00:01:45.250> with<00:01:45.400> this<00:01:45.520> dial<00:01:45.820> indicator<00:01:46.260> so

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
measure it with this dial indicator so

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.260 
measure it with this dial indicator so
that's<00:01:47.440> less<00:01:47.710> than<00:01:47.890> 2,000<00:01:48.550> so<00:01:48.700> that's<00:01:48.880> good

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.340 

had<00:01:52.270> we<00:01:52.420> seen<00:01:52.660> more<00:01:52.720> than<00:01:53.080> two<00:01:53.200> thousands

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
had we seen more than two thousands

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
had we seen more than two thousands
crankshaft<00:01:56.350> would<00:01:56.500> most<00:01:56.710> likely<00:01:56.920> have<00:01:57.220> to<00:01:57.250> be

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:57.370 
crankshaft would most likely have to be

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.700 
crankshaft would most likely have to be
replaced
