00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
so yeah I'm just kind of forcing the air

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.510 
so yeah I'm just kind of forcing the air
through<00:02:22.360> and<00:02:22.630> and<00:02:23.110> I<00:02:23.320> have<00:02:24.070> the<00:02:24.190> intention

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
through and and I have the intention

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.670 
through and and I have the intention
mentally<00:02:25.300> that<00:02:25.480> I<00:02:25.540> want<00:02:25.870> to<00:02:25.960> split<00:02:26.140> that<00:02:26.260> note

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680

mentally that I want to split that note
I<00:02:26.890> think<00:02:27.340> that's<00:02:27.520> actually<00:02:27.730> a<00:02:27.910> big<00:02:28.150> part<00:02:28.390> of<00:02:28.510> it

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
I think that's actually a big part of it

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.720 
I think that's actually a big part of it
is<00:02:28.780> just<00:02:28.960> knowing<00:02:29.560> that<00:02:29.800> that's<00:02:30.220> what<00:02:30.610> I'm

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
is just knowing that that's what I'm

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.220 
is just knowing that that's what I'm
trying<00:02:31.030> to<00:02:31.120> do<00:02:31.300> there's<00:02:31.780> a<00:02:31.840> big<00:02:32.020> difference

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
trying to do there's a big difference

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.590 
trying to do there's a big difference
between<00:02:32.640> splitting<00:02:33.640> the<00:02:33.730> note<00:02:33.910> accidentally

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
between splitting the note accidentally

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.540 
between splitting the note accidentally
