ran the crankcase vent into the valve

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
crankcase vent because the STI blocks

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.230 
crankcase vent because the STI blocks
have<00:01:08.220> an<00:01:08.310> extra<00:01:08.549> port<00:01:08.790> for<00:01:08.939> crankcase

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
have an extra port for crankcase

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.410 
have an extra port for crankcase
ventilation<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.979> the<00:01:10.979> W<00:01:11.250> axis<00:01:11.340> don't<00:01:11.729> because

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
ventilation and the W axis don't because

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.789 
ventilation and the W axis don't because
it<00:01:12.570> meant<00:01:12.750> sin<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.110> valve<00:01:13.290> covers<00:01:13.680> again

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
it meant sin to the valve covers again

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.380 
it meant sin to the valve covers again
but<00:01:14.100> since<00:01:14.250> I<00:01:14.340> didn't<00:01:14.520> have<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.729> extra<00:01:14.909> vent<00:01:15.210> I

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
but since I didn't have the extra vent I

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.670 
but since I didn't have the extra vent I
just<00:01:15.570> tied<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:15.930> into<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.229> valve<00:01:16.409> cover<00:01:16.619> vent

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
just tied it into the valve cover vent

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.170 
just tied it into the valve cover vent
so<00:01:17.400> that'll<00:01:17.700> do<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.909> trick

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
so that'll do the trick

all that out I don't I put about five
minutes<00:02:24.330> idling<00:02:24.780> time<00:02:24.930> on<00:02:25.110> it<00:02:25.230> everything's

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
minutes idling time on it everything's

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.550 
minutes idling time on it everything's
fresh<00:02:25.920> valve<00:02:26.280> guides<00:02:26.550> valves<00:02:27.560> cams

the throttle body - intercooler hose
right<00:02:45.420> now<00:02:45.569> custom<00:02:46.230> well<00:02:46.560> I'm<00:02:46.680> making<00:02:47.010> it<00:02:47.130> to

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
right now custom well I'm making it to

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.840 
right now custom well I'm making it to
fit<00:02:47.819> and<00:02:48.810> then<00:02:49.019> yeah<00:02:49.319> and<00:02:49.650> then<00:02:50.610> I<00:02:50.670> got<00:02:50.819> a

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
fit and then yeah and then I got a

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.460 
fit and then yeah and then I got a
blow-off<00:02:51.239> valve<00:02:51.600> coming<00:02:51.870> in<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:51.989> mail<00:02:52.170> so<00:02:52.440> I

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
blow-off valve coming in the mail so I

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.840 
blow-off valve coming in the mail so I
can<00:02:52.620> hold<00:02:52.799> the<00:02:52.920> more<00:02:53.100> boost<00:02:53.280> I'm<00:02:53.489> gonna<00:02:53.670> hope

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
can hold the more boost I'm gonna hope

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.720 
can hold the more boost I'm gonna hope
to<00:02:54.030> get<00:02:54.120> about<00:02:54.330> 20<00:02:54.890> 18<00:02:55.890> to<00:02:56.010> 20<00:02:56.280> pounds<00:02:56.519> of<00:02:56.580> boost

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
to get about 20 18 to 20 pounds of boost

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.430 
to get about 20 18 to 20 pounds of boost

trainee cuz I don't want to do an STI
training<00:03:46.200> swap<00:03:46.380> or<00:03:46.980> else<00:03:47.100> like<00:03:47.190> I<00:03:47.250> do<00:03:47.310> the

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
training swap or else like I do the

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.310 
training swap or else like I do the
tranny<00:03:47.730> the<00:03:48.030> front<00:03:48.269> axles<00:03:48.660> maybe<00:03:49.079> even

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
tranny the front axles maybe even

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.539 
tranny the front axles maybe even
spindle<00:03:49.709> I'm<00:03:49.829> not<00:03:49.950> sure<00:03:50.100> yet

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
spindle I'm not sure yet

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.690 
spindle I'm not sure yet
I<00:03:50.579> do<00:03:50.940> the<00:03:51.120> rear<00:03:51.299> diff<00:03:51.840> axles<00:03:52.560> and<00:03:52.829> spindles

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
I do the rear diff axles and spindles

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.009 
I do the rear diff axles and spindles
because<00:03:54.000> the<00:03:54.120> axle<00:03:54.420> is<00:03:54.480> different<00:03:54.780> spline

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
because the axle is different spline

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.449 
because the axle is different spline
it's<00:03:55.200> got<00:03:55.320> to<00:03:55.410> change<00:03:55.440> the<00:03:55.650> clutch<00:03:55.829> again<00:03:56.130> to<00:03:56.430> a

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
it's got to change the clutch again to a

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:57.349 
it's got to change the clutch again to a
different<00:03:56.790> clutch<00:03:56.910> because<00:03:57.060> it's<00:03:57.269> got

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
different clutch because it's got

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:00.530 
different clutch because it's got
different<00:03:57.480> splines<00:03:57.930> on<00:03:58.079> the<00:03:58.200> main<00:03:58.829> shaft<00:03:59.540> so

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
different splines on the main shaft so

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.030 
different splines on the main shaft so
yeah<00:04:00.870> I'm<00:04:00.989> just<00:04:01.109> gonna<00:04:01.290> keep<00:04:01.530> it<00:04:01.620> a<00:04:01.650> five-speed
