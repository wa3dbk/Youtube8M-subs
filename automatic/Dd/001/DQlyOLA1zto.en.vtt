00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.669
 dear thomas I have the nasty 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:04.859
 rumors believed in the internet and 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.870
 intended for bio complus son son 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.639
 practically a hd version of mario 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.840
 kart 7 but it is a mistake 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:16.020
 full-blown new game 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:17.010
 it 's 8 and we're playing it now and 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.930
 I would just say let's go 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.210
 I'm going to bed right there 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:27.599
 Choose that sounds gorgeous pink 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:31.070
 also pink game brings I'm with 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.070
 classic mio 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:43.910
 Here you can adjust the placement 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:47.829
 now it is already going on sebastian 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.829
 ready to use nothing there 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:57.070
 haha wust state that looks like though 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.070
 you can do it 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:09.250
 what do you say to have graphics clean? 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.580
 nintendo actually shader 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:15.430
 discovered and maria resolution time became 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:18.640
 It likes the little details now 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:21.310
 looks like this is art lifting power mode 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.250
 So we wrote back to the future 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.440
 Greetings school has to do that 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.870
 movements 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.680
 the shoulder buttons grow on insoles 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.680
 make with springer 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.310
 this browser 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.870
 I'm also running at the 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.860
 I do not know that, though 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.300
 requires that I know of mario k 7, 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.470
 are a lot in there as well 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.150
 for example, just this little flight 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.440
 just under water you can 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.440
 go swimming again 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.620
 where I am 100 percent sure that 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.360
 against is apparently not that way back 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.159
 as in the old parts so i can 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.250
 not so crisscross through the 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:11.230
 third you have to do something 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:21.580
 I hold myself silly 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:27.780
 Once again , Nintendo showed what he did 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.780
 So Chancellor nor depress 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.910
 I accidentally slowed down 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.470
 fallen back accommodations but that 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.400
 I would now buy everything with new ones 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.030
 know again 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.310
 incidentally also very nice that the 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.170
 Blitzkrieg is very important to them 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.190
 graphically celebrate festivals because there 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.739
 any compromises are made 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.510
 but it must look great and work 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.750
 also liquid between lost 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.489
 after all, the third place they arrived 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.230
 just once more and is a third 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.850
 place I think that it is worth a praise 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.140
 a self-praise that is at the moment where the 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.820
 all Japanese players bad 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.790
 will be because you drive on the wall 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:06.250
 along and there it is a rumor that 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.510
 I already really asked that 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.209
 Japanese player problems with 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.650
 ego-shooter and extremely he in 3d 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:13.090
 things I do not know what turn you 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.920
 but I say it like I can 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.820
 to play and also with it the eder 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.820
 easy done 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:26.460
 russia last of the no I need 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.460
 the other hand for the boost 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.940
 I'm the first one again 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.940
 you can believe in the water 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.720
 it's the classic mario kart 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.190
 There is a lot of play in the game 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.210
 random elements through the 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:52.690
 Special weapons There are different ones 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:54.460
 routes I have not found yet 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.730
 but my god I support me 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:59.140
 always unprepared in my games and 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.300
 never used the fire flower at 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:05.650
 mario kart 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:07.990
 Of course they have one 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.490
 wonder a cheerful colorful flop 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.070
 Racing game that guarantees some 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:13.540
 annihilate friendships 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:17.070
 and yes frustration and joy are here 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.070
 traditionally very close together 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.960
 changer sixth right that is a 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.880
 not much joy but also a lot of frustration 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:30.650
 a shortcut 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:32.420
 bring nothing if I've already 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.200
 again rum what maybe just before 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.510
 can already practice 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:40.880
 and you play with the thing and me 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:42.500
 can you tell me of the same very brief yet 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:46.610
 explain what you can do on the gamepad too 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:48.350
 for possibilities then you can 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.650
 switch to the map for 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.880
 placements and the next race 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.260
 which can control is also changing 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:05:02.030
 By now it was gone 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:03.650
 right and tadpoles bony fish 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.420
 everything with the old system 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.800
 yes yes yes course, of course 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.120
 under water also behind 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.600
 you'll look around, too 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.900
 water is on the side too long 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.850
 under water you can meet 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:18.410
 I always forget that, yes you have 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.410
 completely right and fly 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:25.820
 across the ghost 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:28.910
 Katja and inexorably closer than herself 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:32.090
 The bar is packed every time you go 

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:35.210
 such a little bit how can one 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:37.580
 such games where gcl was all that 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:40.850
 just super nintendo or whole 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:44.710
 distance and altitude differences and 

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:47.330
 less graphic i am an old man 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:49.880
 Hamburg is waiting for exactly this match 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:55.780
 that's right since the launch of the wii and 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:55.780
 there will be this year next year 

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.220
 In 2004, I did not know something 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:12.990
 I deliberately place eleven so 

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:14.610
 I just opponent in front of me have the old one 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.840
 moving a mouse can make it a first 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:17.610
 no fun yet 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:26.360
 where does the knowledge of knowledge prefer to stay? 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:29.360
 Mr. editor look like his that you 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.360
 talent 

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:36.219
 I feel the moral winner 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.219
 heart's homes annoy
