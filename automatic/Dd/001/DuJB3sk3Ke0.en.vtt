00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
good on the ball gets down the wing

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.900 
good on the ball gets down the wing
really<00:01:01.410> really<00:01:01.590> well<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.399> be<00:01:02.489> fair<00:01:02.640> his

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
really really well and to be fair his

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.609 
really really well and to be fair his
strength<00:01:03.239> although<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:03.809> isn't<00:01:03.930> great<00:01:04.379> it

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
strength although it isn't great it

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.429 
strength although it isn't great it
isn't<00:01:05.129> too<00:01:05.280> bad<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.670> definitely<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.540> bearable

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
isn't too bad and definitely a bearable

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.320 
isn't too bad and definitely a bearable
for<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.740> winger<00:01:08.070> but<00:01:08.549> then<00:01:08.700> as<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:08.970> can<00:01:09.090> see<00:01:09.210> it

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
for a winger but then as you can see it

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.789 
for a winger but then as you can see it
left<00:01:09.570> footed<00:01:09.750> on<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:09.990> left<00:01:10.170> side<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:10.650> it's

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
left footed on the left side so it's

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.109 
left footed on the left side so it's
good<00:01:10.920> for<00:01:11.070> cross<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.400> if<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.549> like<00:01:11.700> crossing

easily and I could definitely serve some
chances<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.689> hurricane<00:01:49.079> at<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.649> head<00:01:49.860> in

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
chances of hurricane at to a head in

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.130 
chances of hurricane at to a head in
that<00:01:50.100> room<00:01:50.340> which<00:01:50.579> was<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.790> good<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.450> see<00:01:51.659> with<00:01:52.110> a

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
that room which was a good to see with a

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.109 
that room which was a good to see with a
very<00:01:52.380> good<00:01:52.560> winger<00:01:52.799> of<00:01:52.950> raw<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.369> do<00:01:53.430> feel<00:01:53.729> he

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
very good winger of raw and I do feel he

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.609 
very good winger of raw and I do feel he
could<00:01:54.299> put<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.630> left<00:01:54.810> wing<00:01:54.960> position<00:01:55.170> but<00:01:55.500> due

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
could put the left wing position but due

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.170 
could put the left wing position but due
to<00:01:55.649> him<00:01:55.829> being<00:01:55.860> left<00:01:56.219> footed<00:01:56.399> on<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:57.000> left

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
to him being left footed on the left

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.819 
to him being left footed on the left
side<00:01:57.360> he's<00:01:57.840> more<00:01:58.110> of<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.259> cross<00:01:58.469> her<00:01:58.649> than<00:01:58.799> a

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
side he's more of a cross her than a

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.590 
side he's more of a cross her than a
shooter<00:01:59.189> unless<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.790> do<00:01:59.909> I<00:01:59.939> the<00:02:00.090> outside<00:02:00.479> the

decent<00:02:54.270> load<00:02:54.390> player<00:02:54.600> and<00:02:54.840> I<00:02:55.080> do<00:02:55.140> feel<00:02:55.470> he

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
decent load player and I do feel he

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.350 
decent load player and I do feel he
would<00:02:55.770> benefit<00:02:56.160> from<00:02:56.370> em<00:02:56.790> a<00:02:56.820> bit<00:02:57.090> more<00:02:57.209> than

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
would benefit from em a bit more than

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.300 
would benefit from em a bit more than
attacking<00:02:57.600> formation<00:02:57.900> obviously<00:02:58.410> 442<00:02:58.950> those

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
attacking formation obviously 442 those

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.190 
attacking formation obviously 442 those
have<00:02:59.489> the<00:02:59.580> midfielder's<00:03:00.060> a<00:03:00.180> bit<00:03:00.480> set<00:03:00.750> back<00:03:00.930> so

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
have the midfielder's a bit set back so

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.570 
have the midfielder's a bit set back so
yeah<00:03:01.530> maybe<00:03:01.709> more<00:03:02.070> attacking<00:03:02.310> formation

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
yeah maybe more attacking formation

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.670 
yeah maybe more attacking formation
