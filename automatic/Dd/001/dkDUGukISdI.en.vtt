00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.400 
first down so here we go once again we
could<00:01:46.640> run<00:01:46.819> the<00:01:46.940> ball<00:01:47.149> either<00:01:47.539> side<00:01:47.899> to<00:01:48.319> the

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 
could run the ball either side to the

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.469 
could run the ball either side to the
right<00:01:48.440> to<00:01:48.800> the<00:01:48.830> left<00:01:48.920> get<00:01:49.849> the<00:01:50.000> couple<00:01:50.179> yards

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
right to the left get the couple yards

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:51.760 
right to the left get the couple yards
here<00:01:50.750> and<00:01:50.899> there<00:01:51.050> and<00:01:51.289> then<00:01:51.410> all<00:01:51.530> of<00:01:51.649> a<00:01:51.709> sudden

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
here and there and then all of a sudden

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.650 
here and there and then all of a sudden
hit<00:01:52.399> him<00:01:52.550> over<00:01:52.610> the<00:01:52.729> top<00:01:52.849> with<00:01:53.239> this<00:01:53.360> route

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:53.660 
hit him over the top with this route

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.169 
hit him over the top with this route
this<00:01:54.080> is<00:01:54.170> what<00:01:54.319> he<00:01:54.440> likes<00:01:54.619> to<00:01:54.770> run<00:01:55.009> in<00:01:55.910> his

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:56.179 
this is what he likes to run in his

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:57.850 
this is what he likes to run in his
scheme<00:01:56.569> and<00:01:56.899> all<00:01:57.110> you<00:01:57.229> have<00:01:57.289> to<00:01:57.410> do<00:01:57.530> is<00:01:57.590> put<00:01:57.830> the

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
scheme and all you have to do is put the

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.499 
scheme and all you have to do is put the
outside<00:01:58.340> Weber's<00:01:58.489> here<00:01:58.729> on<00:01:58.819> the<00:01:58.940> left<00:01:59.149> on<00:01:59.450> a

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
outside Weber's here on the left on a

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:01.120 
outside Weber's here on the left on a
flat<00:02:00.080> route<00:02:00.349> and<00:02:00.590> that's<00:02:00.739> pretty<00:02:00.890> much<00:02:01.039> the

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
flat route and that's pretty much the

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.820 
flat route and that's pretty much the
same<00:02:01.489> throat<00:02:02.090> a<00:02:02.119> circle<00:02:02.599> for<00:02:02.720> a<00:02:03.500> nice<00:02:03.800> gain

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
same throat a circle for a nice gain

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.919 
same throat a circle for a nice gain
which<00:02:04.459> is<00:02:04.610> actually<00:02:04.759> a<00:02:05.000> really<00:02:05.179> nice<00:02:05.479> little

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:05.929 
which is actually a really nice little

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:07.839 
which is actually a really nice little
glitchy<00:02:06.259> route<00:02:06.590> over<00:02:07.039> there<00:02:07.250> I<00:02:07.429> actually<00:02:07.580> like

00:02:07.839 --> 00:02:07.849 
glitchy route over there I actually like

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:09.520 
glitchy route over there I actually like
to<00:02:07.970> use<00:02:08.090> that<00:02:08.239> route<00:02:08.420> to<00:02:08.599> in<00:02:08.750> my<00:02:08.899> own<00:02:09.140> scheme

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
to use that route to in my own scheme

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.920 
to use that route to in my own scheme
and<00:02:09.739> it<00:02:10.700> actually<00:02:10.879> works<00:02:11.239> pretty<00:02:11.330> good<00:02:11.540> when

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
and it actually works pretty good when

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.930 
and it actually works pretty good when
he<00:02:12.200> that<00:02:12.709> route<00:02:12.950> is<00:02:13.069> trying<00:02:13.280> to<00:02:13.370> go<00:02:13.640> to<00:02:13.700> the

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
he that route is trying to go to the

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.430 
he that route is trying to go to the
outside<00:02:14.090> actually<00:02:14.720> has<00:02:14.840> a<00:02:14.870> little<00:02:14.959> speed

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
outside actually has a little speed

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.960 
outside actually has a little speed
burst<00:02:15.620> to<00:02:15.739> the<00:02:15.830> outside<00:02:16.190> other<00:02:16.790> than<00:02:16.879> that

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
burst to the outside other than that

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.449 
burst to the outside other than that
this<00:02:17.270> is<00:02:17.420> right<00:02:17.569> here<00:02:17.989> it's<00:02:18.200> actually<00:02:18.349> you<00:02:19.280> can

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
this is right here it's actually you can

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:20.920 
this is right here it's actually you can
mix<00:02:19.580> it<00:02:19.700> up<00:02:19.760> with<00:02:19.819> this<00:02:20.000> is<00:02:20.150> a<00:02:20.180> single<00:02:20.690> back<00:02:20.900> a
