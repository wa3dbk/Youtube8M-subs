this<00:00:01.740> is<00:00:01.979> a<00:00:02.010> humerus<00:00:02.760> the<00:00:03.470> humerus<00:00:05.779> has<00:00:06.779> the

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
this is a humerus the humerus has the

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:17.380 
this is a humerus the humerus has the
head<00:00:11.660> and<00:00:12.660> it<00:00:13.230> has<00:00:14.450> the<00:00:15.450> trochlea

head and it has the trochlea

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:23.029 
head and it has the trochlea
on<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.859> front<00:00:19.859> you<00:00:20.760> have<00:00:21.000> three<00:00:21.390> bumps<00:00:21.920> one<00:00:22.920> of

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
on the front you have three bumps one of

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:28.400 
on the front you have three bumps one of
which<00:00:23.220> is<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.609> capitulum<00:00:26.330> furthest<00:00:27.410> closest

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
which is the capitulum furthest closest

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.470 
which is the capitulum furthest closest
to<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.769> trochlea<00:00:29.369> which<00:00:29.640> looks<00:00:29.910> like<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.150> hook

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
to the trochlea which looks like a hook

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.889 
to the trochlea which looks like a hook
is<00:00:30.859> the<00:00:31.859> medial<00:00:33.200> epicondyle<00:00:35.450> that<00:00:36.450> makes<00:00:36.719> the

other the lateral epicondyle since this
is<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.340> capitulum<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.090> this<00:00:45.270> is<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.539> front

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
is the capitulum and this is the front

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.729 
is the capitulum and this is the front
you<00:00:46.890> see<00:00:47.270> this<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.510> called<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.020> coronoid

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
you see this is called the coronoid

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:58.600 
you see this is called the coronoid
process

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:58.610

on the front you can see the

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:08.160 
on the front you can see the
intertubercular<00:01:03.330> groove

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:17.560 

it's<00:01:08.770> that<00:01:09.040> groove<00:01:09.370> right<00:01:09.910> here

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570

this<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.430> lesser<00:01:20.900> tubercle<00:01:21.920> this<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.160> the

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
this is the lesser tubercle this is the

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.800 
this is the lesser tubercle this is the
greater<00:01:23.700> tubercle

the part where it kind of bends and goes

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.740 
the part where it kind of bends and goes
in<00:01:48.550> this<00:01:49.420> is<00:01:49.600> called<00:01:49.810> the<00:01:50.080> deltoid<00:01:50.590> tuberosity

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
in this is called the deltoid tuberosity

in this is called the deltoid tuberosity
here<00:01:54.240> this<00:01:55.240> is<00:01:55.450> the<00:01:56.040> anatomical<00:01:57.040> neck<00:01:57.790> this<00:01:58.540> is

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
here this is the anatomical neck this is

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.580 
here this is the anatomical neck this is
a<00:01:58.840> surgical<00:01:59.260> neck<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:01.180> body<00:02:01.450> of<00:02:01.810> the<00:02:02.170> humerus

a surgical neck the body of the humerus
and<00:02:04.260> on<00:02:05.260> the<00:02:05.500> other<00:02:05.710> side<00:02:05.860> which<00:02:06.370> would<00:02:06.550> be<00:02:06.730> the

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
and on the other side which would be the

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.910 
and on the other side which would be the
back<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:08.140> have<00:02:08.380> the<00:02:08.530> olecranon<00:02:08.980> fossa<00:02:10.920> again

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
back you have the olecranon fossa again

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.240 
back you have the olecranon fossa again
the<00:02:12.160> medial<00:02:12.690> epicondyle<00:02:13.690> lateral<00:02:14.590> epicondyle

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
the medial epicondyle lateral epicondyle

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.340 
the medial epicondyle lateral epicondyle
because<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:15.730> medial<00:02:16.090> epicondyle<00:02:16.210> is<00:02:16.960> always

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
because the medial epicondyle is always

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.380 
because the medial epicondyle is always
close<00:02:17.620> to<00:02:17.650> the<00:02:17.950> trochlea<00:02:18.520> and<00:02:19.020> then<00:02:20.020> you<00:02:20.260> have

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
close to the trochlea and then you have

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.340 
close to the trochlea and then you have
the<00:02:22.390> greater<00:02:22.690> tubercle<00:02:24.600> again<00:02:25.600> you<00:02:25.960> can<00:02:26.140> see

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
the greater tubercle again you can see

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.400 
the greater tubercle again you can see
that<00:02:26.530> that's<00:02:26.680> the<00:02:26.890> greater<00:02:27.190> tubercle<00:02:28.140> this<00:02:29.140> is

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
that that's the greater tubercle this is

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.980 
that that's the greater tubercle this is
the<00:02:29.590> lesser<00:02:30.040> tubercle<00:02:30.460> this<00:02:31.300> is<00:02:31.540> the<00:02:31.690> greater

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
the lesser tubercle this is the greater

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:49.459 
the lesser tubercle this is the greater
tubercle<00:02:33.570> this<00:02:34.570> is<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:34.900> head<00:02:35.200> of<00:02:35.530> the<00:02:35.770> humerus

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:49.469 

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:52.259 

in<00:02:50.469> order<00:02:50.739> to<00:02:50.769> tell<00:02:51.040> which<00:02:51.280> side<00:02:51.519> this<00:02:51.760> is<00:02:52.030> you

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
in order to tell which side this is you

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:55.619 
in order to tell which side this is you
always<00:02:52.569> look<00:02:52.780> for<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:54.280> capitulum<00:02:55.150> which<00:02:55.480> are

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:55.629 
always look for the capitulum which are

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:58.199 
always look for the capitulum which are
the<00:02:55.719> three<00:02:55.900> bumps<00:02:56.230> first<00:02:56.650> and<00:02:56.950> then<00:02:57.909> that

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
the three bumps first and then that

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.690 
the three bumps first and then that
tells<00:02:58.480> you<00:02:58.599> it's<00:02:58.750> the<00:02:58.810> front<00:02:59.200> you<00:03:00.159> use<00:03:00.400> that

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
tells you it's the front you use that

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:07.160 
tells you it's the front you use that
along<00:03:01.209> with<00:03:01.569> the<00:03:03.120> intertubercular<00:03:04.120> groove

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.740 

and<00:03:08.170> the<00:03:09.159> intertubercular<00:03:09.730> groove<00:03:09.970> tells<00:03:10.599> you

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
and the intertubercular groove tells you

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.270 
and the intertubercular groove tells you
it's<00:03:10.900> the<00:03:11.079> front<00:03:12.569> then<00:03:13.569> you<00:03:13.780> rotate<00:03:14.170> it<00:03:14.349> you

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
it's the front then you rotate it you

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.699 
it's the front then you rotate it you
know<00:03:15.459> that<00:03:15.609> this<00:03:15.700> is<00:03:15.849> the<00:03:15.939> medial<00:03:16.389> epicondyle

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
know that this is the medial epicondyle

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.479 
know that this is the medial epicondyle
closest<00:03:17.709> to<00:03:17.889> the<00:03:18.040> eastern<00:03:19.769> and<00:03:20.769> because<00:03:21.340> this

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
closest to the eastern and because this

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.490 
closest to the eastern and because this
is<00:03:21.639> the<00:03:21.700> medial<00:03:22.030> epicondyle<00:03:22.260> closest<00:03:23.260> to<00:03:23.409> the

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
is the medial epicondyle closest to the

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.909 
is the medial epicondyle closest to the
trochlea<00:03:24.040> that<00:03:24.549> makes<00:03:24.849> this<00:03:25.420> whole<00:03:25.919> line

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:26.919 
trochlea that makes this whole line

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:29.360
