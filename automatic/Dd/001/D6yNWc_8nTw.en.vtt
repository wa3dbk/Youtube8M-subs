movement<00:01:52.770> right<00:01:53.770> so<00:01:54.400> it<00:01:54.490> means<00:01:54.729> on<00:01:55.060> this<00:01:55.420> part

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
movement right so it means on this part

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.670 
movement right so it means on this part
of<00:01:56.259> the<00:01:56.590> coleoptile<00:01:56.979> system<00:01:57.820> the

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
of the coleoptile system the

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.399 
of the coleoptile system the
concentration<00:01:59.680> of<00:01:59.860> aux-in<00:02:00.130> is<00:02:00.670> high<00:02:01.210> and<00:02:01.810> in

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
concentration of aux-in is high and in

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.340 
concentration of aux-in is high and in
this<00:02:02.710> part<00:02:03.130> of<00:02:03.369> the<00:02:03.610> coleoptile<00:02:04.000> stump<00:02:04.990> the

this part of the coleoptile stump the
concentration<00:02:06.280> is<00:02:06.460> low<00:02:06.960> so<00:02:07.960> you<00:02:08.019> know<00:02:08.289> that

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:08.529 
concentration is low so you know that

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:11.429 
concentration is low so you know that
oxen<00:02:09.129> is<00:02:09.279> a<00:02:09.310> growth<00:02:09.759> hormone<00:02:10.599> which<00:02:10.629> results

00:02:11.429 --> 00:02:11.439 
oxen is a growth hormone which results

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:13.589 
oxen is a growth hormone which results
in<00:02:11.680> cell<00:02:12.129> elongation

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 
in cell elongation

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:17.489 
in cell elongation
so<00:02:14.499> due<00:02:14.650> to<00:02:14.680> this<00:02:14.950> on<00:02:15.340> this<00:02:16.299> part<00:02:16.719> of<00:02:17.109> the

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:17.499 
so due to this on this part of the

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:20.759 
so due to this on this part of the
coleoptile<00:02:17.859> is<00:02:18.430> growth<00:02:18.939> is<00:02:19.359> more<00:02:19.780> elongation

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
coleoptile is growth is more elongation

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:24.750 
coleoptile is growth is more elongation
is<00:02:21.129> more<00:02:21.400> and<00:02:21.730> at<00:02:22.569> this<00:02:23.079> part<00:02:23.499> elongation<00:02:24.340> is

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
is more and at this part elongation is

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.470 
is more and at this part elongation is
less<00:02:25.209> so<00:02:25.959> one<00:02:26.290> side<00:02:26.709> growth<00:02:27.370> is<00:02:27.700> more<00:02:28.030> on<00:02:28.420> the

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
less so one side growth is more on the

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.800 
less so one side growth is more on the
another<00:02:29.319> side<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:30.129> growth<00:02:30.430> is<00:02:30.760> less<00:02:31.090> which

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
another side the growth is less which

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.789 
another side the growth is less which
results<00:02:32.560> in<00:02:32.799> bending<00:02:33.730> off<00:02:34.290> coleoptile<00:02:35.290> means

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
results in bending off coleoptile means

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:45.979 
results in bending off coleoptile means

the<00:03:40.120> second<00:03:40.569> one<00:03:40.750> is<00:03:40.930> that<00:03:41.229> this<00:03:41.799> Avena

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
the second one is that this Avena

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.140 
the second one is that this Avena
curvature<00:03:43.239> test<00:03:43.599> it<00:03:43.930> tells<00:03:44.379> the<00:03:45.120> identity<00:03:46.120> of

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
curvature test it tells the identity of

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.379 
curvature test it tells the identity of
the<00:03:46.780> hormone<00:03:47.669> identity<00:03:48.669> of<00:03:48.849> chemical

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:49.389 
the hormone identity of chemical

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:51.990 
the hormone identity of chemical
substance<00:03:49.959> so<00:03:50.680> now<00:03:50.859> we<00:03:50.919> can<00:03:51.340> look<00:03:51.370> for<00:03:51.819> the

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
substance so now we can look for the

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.929 
substance so now we can look for the
right<00:03:52.209> option<00:03:52.900> the<00:03:53.500> right<00:03:53.709> option<00:03:54.220> is<00:03:54.400> it<00:03:54.699> is

00:03:54.929 --> 00:03:54.939 
right option the right option is it is

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:59.429 
right option the right option is it is
made<00:03:55.299> possible<00:03:56.049> the<00:03:56.639> isolation<00:03:57.639> and<00:03:58.439> exact

00:03:59.429 --> 00:03:59.439 
made possible the isolation and exact

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:03.929 
made possible the isolation and exact
identification<00:04:00.430> of<00:04:01.180> hormone<00:04:02.049> so<00:04:02.799> this<00:04:03.280> option

00:04:03.929 --> 00:04:03.939 
identification of hormone so this option

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:05.969 
identification of hormone so this option
number<00:04:04.060> one<00:04:04.449> is<00:04:04.780> the<00:04:05.049> right<00:04:05.319> option<00:04:05.680> for

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:05.979 
number one is the right option for

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:09.390 
number one is the right option for
question<00:04:06.699> number<00:04:06.780> 108<00:04:07.780> so<00:04:08.620> this<00:04:08.799> is<00:04:08.949> all<00:04:09.099> about

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
question number 108 so this is all about

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.789 
question number 108 so this is all about
question<00:04:09.939> of<00:04:10.030> 108<00:04:10.659> let's<00:04:10.989> proceed<00:04:11.289> to<00:04:11.590> the

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
question of 108 let's proceed to the

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:15.539 
question of 108 let's proceed to the
next<00:04:12.039> one<00:04:12.459> that<00:04:12.639> is<00:04:12.879> 109
