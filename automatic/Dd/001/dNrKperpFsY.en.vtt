there breed these I'm just going to do

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.029 
there breed these I'm just going to do
three<00:00:48.570> for<00:00:48.809> now<00:00:48.930> just<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.379> show<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:49.649> that<00:00:49.829> is

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
three for now just to show you that is

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.729 
three for now just to show you that is
consistent<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.239> efficient<00:00:53.930> alright<00:00:54.930> so<00:00:55.170> now

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
consistent and efficient alright so now

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.740 
consistent and efficient alright so now
it<00:00:56.129> may<00:00:56.610> lag<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.910> little<00:00:57.059> bit<00:00:57.360> cuz<00:00:57.480> there's<00:00:57.660> a

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
it may lag a little bit cuz there's a

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.799 
it may lag a little bit cuz there's a
lot<00:00:58.020> of<00:00:58.140> redstone<00:00:58.410> involved<00:00:59.210> but<00:01:00.210> as<00:01:00.449> you<00:01:00.719> can

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
lot of redstone involved but as you can

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.200 
lot of redstone involved but as you can
see<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.859> cows<00:01:02.070> get<00:01:02.340> dropped<00:01:02.699> down<00:01:02.820> into<00:01:03.000> this

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
see the cows get dropped down into this

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.200 
see the cows get dropped down into this
water<00:01:03.539> source<00:01:04.369> and<00:01:05.369> then<00:01:05.610> what<00:01:05.760> happens<00:01:06.060> is

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
water source and then what happens is

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.670 
water source and then what happens is
they<00:01:06.390> get<00:01:06.540> put<00:01:06.840> on<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:07.320> these<00:01:07.439> pistons<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:09.680> as

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
they get put on to these pistons and as

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
they get put on to these pistons and as
you<00:01:10.920> see<00:01:11.159> they<00:01:11.549> travel<00:01:13.820> up<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.390> Pistons<00:01:15.840> a

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
you see they travel up the Pistons a

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.300 
you see they travel up the Pistons a
little<00:01:17.700> bit<00:01:17.850> laggy<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.890> think<00:01:19.890> we<00:01:19.979> can<00:01:20.130> deal

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
little bit laggy I think we can deal

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.240 
little bit laggy I think we can deal
with<00:01:20.340> it<00:01:21.020> as<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.200> can<00:01:22.290> see<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.710> cow<00:01:22.920> gets

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
with it as you can see the cow gets

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.850 
with it as you can see the cow gets
pushed<00:01:23.490> out<00:01:23.759> up<00:01:24.150> here<00:01:25.070> there's<00:01:26.070> that<00:01:26.400> cow<00:01:26.670> and

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
pushed out up here there's that cow and

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.830 
pushed out up here there's that cow and
they<00:01:28.860> come<00:01:29.189> back<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.210> end<00:01:30.360> of<00:01:30.509> this<00:01:30.570> water

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
they come back to the end of this water

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.230 
they come back to the end of this water
source<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.380> now<00:01:31.500> up<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:32.579> have<00:01:32.850> these<00:01:33.060> little

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
source and now up I have these little

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.660 
source and now up I have these little
dividers<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.759> so<00:01:35.759> whenever<00:01:36.290> you<00:01:37.290> uh<00:01:37.670> breed

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
dividers and so whenever you uh breed

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.399 
dividers and so whenever you uh breed
the<00:01:38.820> cows<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:40.070> you<00:01:41.070> move<00:01:41.250> on<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.610> next<00:01:41.850> one

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
the cows and you move on to the next one

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.649 
the cows and you move on to the next one
I'll<00:01:43.409> show<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.619> what<00:01:43.860> happens<00:01:44.360> you<00:01:45.360> click

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
I'll show you what happens you click

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.620 
I'll show you what happens you click
that<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.259> they<00:01:46.590> open<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.759> close<00:01:48.030> for<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.390> split

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
that and they open and close for a split

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.139 
that and they open and close for a split
second<00:01:49.020> so<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.200> everyone<00:01:49.710> moves<00:01:50.430> down<00:01:50.759> the

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
second so that everyone moves down the

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.039 
second so that everyone moves down the
line<00:01:51.600> once<00:01:52.759> and<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:54.090> only<00:01:54.270> problem<00:01:54.600> I've<00:01:54.990> had

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
line once and the only problem I've had

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.230 
line once and the only problem I've had
so<00:01:55.979> far<00:01:56.250> is<00:01:56.490> actually<00:01:56.909> a<00:01:58.579> at<00:01:59.579> this<00:01:59.909> part<00:02:00.180> right

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
so far is actually a at this part right

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.399 
so far is actually a at this part right
here

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409

as you can tell I happen to get both of

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.970 
as you can tell I happen to get both of
them<00:02:07.749> but<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:10.030> should<00:02:10.660> be<00:02:10.840> okay<00:02:11.200> however

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
whenever I hear I'll just spawn from

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.729 
whenever I hear I'll just spawn from
cows<00:02:15.040> if<00:02:15.430> like<00:02:16.330> two<00:02:16.599> cows<00:02:16.930> come<00:02:17.379> in<00:02:17.530> at<00:02:17.650> the

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:21.549 
same time which is I I built this system

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:23.720 
same time which is I I built this system
right<00:02:21.879> here<00:02:21.940> to<00:02:22.330> stop<00:02:22.629> that<00:02:22.810> from<00:02:22.870> happening

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
right here to stop that from happening

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
they somehow sometimes still get stuck

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.490 
they somehow sometimes still get stuck
but<00:02:30.340> I<00:02:30.750> it<00:02:31.750> seems<00:02:32.349> to<00:02:32.500> be<00:02:32.620> okay<00:02:34.049> but<00:02:35.049> yeah<00:02:35.470> I

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.530 
but I it seems to be okay but yeah I
think<00:02:35.590> I<00:02:35.829> fixed<00:02:36.040> it<00:02:36.280> with<00:02:36.519> this<00:02:37.000> mechanism

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
think I fixed it with this mechanism

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.180 
think I fixed it with this mechanism
right<00:02:37.660> here<00:02:37.720> cuz<00:02:38.230> that<00:02:38.590> was<00:02:38.709> the<00:02:38.829> only<00:02:38.950> thing

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
right here cuz that was the only thing

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.610 
right here cuz that was the only thing
slowing<00:02:39.760> it<00:02:40.090> down<00:02:40.120> and<00:02:42.840> yeah<00:02:43.840> it's<00:02:44.230> really

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
slowing it down and yeah it's really

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.729 
slowing it down and yeah it's really
efficient<00:02:45.099> and<00:02:45.190> works<00:02:45.340> great<00:02:45.489> and<00:02:46.379> I'll<00:02:47.379> show

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
efficient and works great and I'll show

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.650 
efficient and works great and I'll show
you<00:02:47.769> every<00:02:48.700> bit<00:02:48.910> of<00:02:48.940> the<00:02:49.060> Redstone<00:02:49.450> really

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
you every bit of the Redstone really

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.860 
you every bit of the Redstone really
quick<00:02:50.010> what's<00:02:51.010> back<00:02:52.799> that's<00:02:53.799> weird<00:02:54.250> that

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
quick what's back that's weird that

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.720 
quick what's back that's weird that
should<00:02:55.870> not<00:02:56.019> happen

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
should not happen

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.580 
should not happen
um<00:02:59.069> you<00:03:00.069> see<00:03:00.310> all<00:03:01.060> right<00:03:01.180> so<00:03:01.390> basically<00:03:01.590> you

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
um you see all right so basically you

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.210 
um you see all right so basically you
breed<00:03:02.859> them<00:03:02.890> uh<00:03:03.870> the<00:03:04.870> the<00:03:05.440> baby<00:03:05.680> cow<00:03:05.950> gets

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
breed them uh the the baby cow gets

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.620 
breed them uh the the baby cow gets
attracted<00:03:06.459> by<00:03:06.760> the<00:03:06.819> wheat<00:03:07.090> and<00:03:07.269> he<00:03:07.329> goes<00:03:07.480> in

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
attracted by the wheat and he goes in

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.030 
attracted by the wheat and he goes in
the<00:03:07.690> water<00:03:07.870> and<00:03:08.230> then<00:03:08.799> this<00:03:09.609> button<00:03:11.040> activates

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
the water and then this button activates

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.789 
the water and then this button activates
this<00:03:12.489> redstone<00:03:12.880> which<00:03:13.299> sends<00:03:14.019> out<00:03:14.139> a<00:03:14.170> flashing

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:14.799 
this redstone which sends out a flashing

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:17.789 
this redstone which sends out a flashing
poults<00:03:15.780> which<00:03:16.780> is<00:03:16.930> what<00:03:17.109> this<00:03:17.260> little<00:03:17.500> thing

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
poults which is what this little thing

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:23.220 
poults which is what this little thing
is<00:03:18.130> right<00:03:18.310> here<00:03:18.489> if<00:03:18.609> I<00:03:18.700> can<00:03:19.470> see<00:03:20.470> I<00:03:21.690> can<00:03:22.690> show<00:03:23.079> it

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
is right here if I can see I can show it

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.330 
is right here if I can see I can show it
to<00:03:23.260> you<00:03:24.959> it<00:03:25.959> sends<00:03:26.230> out<00:03:26.290> a<00:03:26.349> quick<00:03:26.769> little<00:03:27.069> poles

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
to you it sends out a quick little poles

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:35.690 
to you it sends out a quick little poles
and<00:03:28.500> what<00:03:29.500> that<00:03:29.680> does<00:03:29.919> is<00:03:30.250> save<00:03:31.410> the<00:03:34.470> here

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
and what that does is save the here

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.849 
and what that does is save the here
alright<00:03:36.700> so<00:03:36.880> what<00:03:37.720> it<00:03:37.840> does<00:03:37.989> is<00:03:38.230> it<00:03:38.530> sends<00:03:38.739> a

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:38.859 
alright so what it does is it sends a

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:40.589 
alright so what it does is it sends a
pulse<00:03:39.010> into<00:03:39.459> this<00:03:39.579> block<00:03:39.910> right<00:03:39.940> here<00:03:40.150> which

00:03:40.589 --> 00:03:40.599 
pulse into this block right here which

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:43.430 
pulse into this block right here which
touches<00:03:41.079> the<00:03:41.260> redstone<00:03:41.650> torch<00:03:41.680> it<00:03:42.609> turns<00:03:43.030> off

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
touches the redstone torch it turns off

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.780 
touches the redstone torch it turns off
these<00:03:44.440> pistons<00:03:45.010> right<00:03:45.370> here<00:03:45.849> and<00:03:46.030> right<00:03:47.790> down

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
these pistons right here and right down

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.159 
these pistons right here and right down
here<00:03:49.419> for<00:03:50.019> a<00:03:50.079> split<00:03:50.530> second<00:03:51.010> and<00:03:51.099> then<00:03:51.970> on<00:03:52.419> both

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:53.169 
here for a split second and then on both

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:55.289 
here for a split second and then on both
sides<00:03:53.470> you<00:03:53.680> have<00:03:53.769> redstone<00:03:54.549> torches<00:03:54.910> going<00:03:55.000> up

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
sides you have redstone torches going up

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:58.349 
sides you have redstone torches going up
to<00:03:55.450> the<00:03:55.510> top<00:03:55.660> up<00:03:55.870> here<00:03:55.900> and<00:03:56.549> on<00:03:57.549> both<00:03:57.790> sides<00:03:58.090> we

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:58.359 
to the top up here and on both sides we

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:02.069 
to the top up here and on both sides we
have<00:03:58.829> a<00:03:59.829> piston<00:04:00.760> and<00:04:01.000> it<00:04:01.269> pushes<00:04:01.480> this<00:04:01.780> out<00:04:01.959> the

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
have a piston and it pushes this out the

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:04.979 
have a piston and it pushes this out the
way<00:04:02.549> making<00:04:03.549> all<00:04:03.910> these<00:04:04.120> shut<00:04:04.419> off<00:04:04.569> for<00:04:04.930> a

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
way making all these shut off for a

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.400 
way making all these shut off for a
split<00:04:05.230> second<00:04:05.650> and<00:04:05.799> then<00:04:06.730> this<00:04:07.599> gets<00:04:08.049> pushed

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
split second and then this gets pushed

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.890 
split second and then this gets pushed
back<00:04:08.680> onto<00:04:09.310> it<00:04:09.459> which<00:04:09.639> pushes<00:04:09.970> them<00:04:10.359> back<00:04:10.389> so

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
back onto it which pushes them back so

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.890 
back onto it which pushes them back so
I'll<00:04:11.079> show<00:04:11.289> you<00:04:11.320> that<00:04:11.440> really<00:04:12.430> quick

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
I'll show you that really quick

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.699 
I'll show you that really quick
Oh

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:24.129 

didn't<00:04:21.709> go<00:04:22.210> see<00:04:23.210> if<00:04:23.300> I<00:04:23.360> can<00:04:23.389> do<00:04:23.570> it<00:04:23.600> again<00:04:23.810> here

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 
didn't go see if I can do it again here

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:29.590 
didn't go see if I can do it again here
I<00:04:24.199> won't<00:04:24.380> read<00:04:24.590> them<00:04:24.680> I'll<00:04:24.830> just<00:04:24.979> send<00:04:25.520> them<00:04:28.600> so

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
I won't read them I'll just send them so

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.670 
I won't read them I'll just send them so
I<00:04:29.630> don't<00:04:29.780> know<00:04:29.990> if<00:04:30.050> you<00:04:30.139> can<00:04:30.229> see<00:04:30.410> that<00:04:30.560> but

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
I don't know if you can see that but

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.560 
I don't know if you can see that but
that's<00:04:30.860> how<00:04:30.979> it<00:04:31.100> works<00:04:31.310> and<00:04:31.639> it<00:04:32.210> affects<00:04:32.419> all

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
that's how it works and it affects all

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.469 
that's how it works and it affects all
these<00:04:32.750> pistons<00:04:33.169> and<00:04:33.380> then<00:04:33.500> how<00:04:34.400> this<00:04:34.699> works<00:04:35.120> is

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479 
these pistons and then how this works is

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:40.960 
these pistons and then how this works is
as<00:04:36.290> you<00:04:36.620> can<00:04:36.650> probably<00:04:37.460> tell<00:04:38.080> it's<00:04:39.080> just<00:04:39.970> let

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
as you can probably tell it's just let

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.189 
as you can probably tell it's just let
me<00:04:41.060> see<00:04:41.270> if<00:04:42.400> these<00:04:43.400> cows<00:04:43.729> can<00:04:44.030> hurry<00:04:44.270> up<00:04:44.449> so<00:04:45.169> I

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 
me see if these cows can hurry up so I

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:48.730 
me see if these cows can hurry up so I
can<00:04:45.410> show<00:04:45.440> you<00:04:46.449> the<00:04:47.449> Redstone<00:04:47.990> behind<00:04:48.020> it<00:04:48.440> here

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
can show you the Redstone behind it here

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.650 
can show you the Redstone behind it here
all<00:04:49.370> right<00:04:49.490> they<00:04:49.820> look<00:04:50.030> to<00:04:50.150> be<00:04:50.180> done<00:04:50.479> right

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
all right they look to be done right

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:58.180 
all right they look to be done right
here<00:04:50.720> so<00:04:51.410> what<00:04:51.830> happens<00:04:52.160> down<00:04:52.310> here<00:04:52.370> is<00:04:57.039> to<00:04:58.039> get

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
here so what happens down here is to get

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:03.400 
here so what happens down here is to get
some<00:04:58.370> blue<00:04:59.470> the<00:05:01.270> the<00:05:02.270> cows<00:05:02.570> come<00:05:02.990> and<00:05:03.289> they

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
some blue the the cows come and they

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.520 
some blue the the cows come and they
activate<00:05:03.919> this<00:05:04.160> trip<00:05:04.460> wire<00:05:04.750> which<00:05:05.750> activates

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
activate this trip wire which activates

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:10.740 
activate this trip wire which activates
this<00:05:06.680> redstone<00:05:07.039> and<00:05:07.160> eight<00:05:07.580> I<00:05:07.789> gave<00:05:08.270> it<00:05:08.419> a<00:05:08.710> 12

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:10.750 
this redstone and eight I gave it a 12

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:15.129 
this redstone and eight I gave it a 12
full<00:05:11.860> repeater<00:05:12.860> delay<00:05:13.250> because<00:05:14.240> the<00:05:14.960> cow

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:15.139 
full repeater delay because the cow

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:17.920 
full repeater delay because the cow
sometimes<00:05:15.740> swim<00:05:16.130> backwards<00:05:16.430> and<00:05:17.060> it<00:05:17.750> takes

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
sometimes swim backwards and it takes

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.620 
sometimes swim backwards and it takes
some<00:05:18.080> wattage<00:05:18.350> right<00:05:18.530> here<00:05:18.800> so<00:05:19.490> and<00:05:20.270> then<00:05:20.419> once

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:20.630 
some wattage right here so and then once

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:25.210 
some wattage right here so and then once
that<00:05:20.690> happens<00:05:21.610> this<00:05:22.610> is<00:05:22.880> sets<00:05:23.599> this<00:05:23.810> off<00:05:24.050> to<00:05:24.530> me

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.220 
that happens this is sets this off to me

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.210 
that happens this is sets this off to me
you<00:05:25.789> got<00:05:26.030> each<00:05:26.960> of<00:05:27.260> these<00:05:27.410> bottom<00:05:27.830> repeaters

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
you got each of these bottom repeaters

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.460 
you got each of these bottom repeaters
and<00:05:28.580> that<00:05:28.729> cow<00:05:28.940> still<00:05:29.360> there<00:05:29.510> some<00:05:29.780> see<00:05:30.289> that's

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
and that cow still there some see that's

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:31.510 
and that cow still there some see that's
what<00:05:30.560> I'm<00:05:30.620> talking<00:05:30.650> about<00:05:30.860> they<00:05:31.070> get<00:05:31.190> stuck

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:31.520 
what I'm talking about they get stuck

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.200 
what I'm talking about they get stuck
but<00:05:32.030> only<00:05:32.210> one<00:05:32.539> gets<00:05:32.720> stuck<00:05:33.050> and<00:05:33.320> then<00:05:34.210> usually

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210 
but only one gets stuck and then usually

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:36.640 
but only one gets stuck and then usually
it<00:05:35.360> catches<00:05:35.660> them<00:05:35.810> on<00:05:35.930> the<00:05:36.020> next<00:05:36.139> round<00:05:36.410> which

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
it catches them on the next round which

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:39.730 
it catches them on the next round which
is<00:05:36.680> fine<00:05:36.979> and<00:05:37.340> so<00:05:38.150> as<00:05:39.020> you<00:05:39.139> can<00:05:39.229> see<00:05:39.289> we<00:05:39.560> got<00:05:39.680> two

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740 
is fine and so as you can see we got two

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.339 
is fine and so as you can see we got two
and<00:05:39.979> then<00:05:40.430> four<00:05:40.580> and<00:05:40.820> then<00:05:41.210> six<00:05:41.240> and<00:05:41.990> then

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:42.349 
and then four and then six and then

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:44.860 
and then four and then six and then
eight<00:05:42.620> and<00:05:42.979> you<00:05:43.490> do<00:05:43.669> that<00:05:43.849> all<00:05:44.150> the<00:05:44.180> way<00:05:44.389> up<00:05:44.510> and

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:44.870 
eight and you do that all the way up and

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.890 
eight and you do that all the way up and
then<00:05:44.960> on<00:05:45.110> the<00:05:45.229> top<00:05:45.470> layer<00:05:45.910> that<00:05:46.910> pushes<00:05:47.330> the

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:47.900 
then on the top layer that pushes the

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.439 
then on the top layer that pushes the
cows<00:05:48.169> on<00:05:48.710> to<00:05:49.099> the<00:05:49.190> next<00:05:49.340> one<00:05:49.610> you<00:05:49.820> just<00:05:50.270> do

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:50.449 
cows on to the next one you just do

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:52.659 
cows on to the next one you just do
three<00:05:50.990> five<00:05:51.560> seven<00:05:51.949> nine<00:05:52.099> so<00:05:52.370> on<00:05:52.460> the<00:05:52.550> bottom

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:52.669 
three five seven nine so on the bottom

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:55.270 
three five seven nine so on the bottom
you<00:05:52.940> do<00:05:53.090> even<00:05:53.449> on<00:05:53.570> the<00:05:53.720> top<00:05:53.930> you<00:05:54.110> do<00:05:54.260> odd<00:05:54.470> for

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 
you do even on the top you do odd for

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.740 
you do even on the top you do odd for
anyone<00:05:55.580> that<00:05:55.729> wants<00:05:55.789> to<00:05:56.090> know<00:05:56.210> how<00:05:56.389> to<00:05:56.419> do<00:05:56.630> this

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:56.750 
anyone that wants to know how to do this

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.960 
anyone that wants to know how to do this
because<00:05:56.840> I<00:05:57.050> can<00:05:57.380> this<00:05:57.889> took<00:05:58.190> me<00:05:58.370> forever<00:05:58.610> to

00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:58.970 
because I can this took me forever to

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:01.390 
because I can this took me forever to
just<00:05:59.090> to<00:05:59.599> figure<00:05:59.900> out<00:06:00.080> how<00:06:00.260> to<00:06:00.320> build<00:06:00.590> this<00:06:01.280> is

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:01.400 
just to figure out how to build this is

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.159 
just to figure out how to build this is
my<00:06:01.550> design<00:06:01.849> by<00:06:02.000> the<00:06:02.030> way<00:06:02.150> like<00:06:02.599> I<00:06:02.750> didn't<00:06:02.960> want

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:03.169 
my design by the way like I didn't want

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:06.390 
my design by the way like I didn't want
this<00:06:03.320> up<00:06:03.470> on<00:06:03.620> YouTube<00:06:03.919> or<00:06:04.039> anything<00:06:04.360> so<00:06:05.360> uh

yeah it's very so let me show you that

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:15.370 
yeah it's very so let me show you that
the<00:06:10.449> cows<00:06:11.449> do<00:06:11.780> fix<00:06:12.139> themselves

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:15.380 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.550 

so<00:06:15.560> I'll<00:06:15.710> press<00:06:15.950> that<00:06:16.190> again<00:06:17.110> let<00:06:18.110> me<00:06:18.230> go<00:06:18.350> put

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 
so I'll press that again let me go put

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:21.730 
so I'll press that again let me go put
that<00:06:18.800> blue<00:06:19.220> mule<00:06:19.490> back<00:06:19.850> like<00:06:20.590> we'll<00:06:21.590> be<00:06:21.620> able

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:21.740 
that blue mule back like we'll be able

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.270 
that blue mule back like we'll be able
to<00:06:21.980> see<00:06:22.280> them<00:06:22.460> actually<00:06:22.700> uh<00:06:24.040> coming<00:06:25.040> through

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:25.280 
to see them actually uh coming through

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:27.760 
to see them actually uh coming through
hopefully<00:06:25.490> alright<00:06:26.180> so<00:06:26.360> I<00:06:26.690> don't<00:06:27.530> know<00:06:27.590> where

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:27.770 
hopefully alright so I don't know where

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:32.710 
hopefully alright so I don't know where
that<00:06:27.920> other<00:06:28.040> cow<00:06:28.280> in<00:06:28.490> is<00:06:28.670> still<00:06:31.210> as<00:06:32.210> you<00:06:32.510> can

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:32.720 
that other cow in is still as you can

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.530 
that other cow in is still as you can
see<00:06:32.960> the<00:06:33.350> cows<00:06:33.590> are<00:06:33.920> scaling<00:06:34.340> up<00:06:34.580> and<00:06:34.910> up<00:06:35.360> and

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:35.540 
see the cows are scaling up and up and

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:37.090 
see the cows are scaling up and up and
caught<00:06:35.810> that<00:06:36.050> second<00:06:36.440> one<00:06:36.530> if<00:06:36.680> you<00:06:36.770> can<00:06:36.890> see

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:37.100 
caught that second one if you can see

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:42.790 
caught that second one if you can see
over<00:06:37.280> there<00:06:38.440> and<00:06:39.440> yeah<00:06:39.650> so<00:06:40.960> it's<00:06:41.960> a<00:06:42.080> really

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 
over there and yeah so it's a really

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.610 
over there and yeah so it's a really
efficient<00:06:43.310> works<00:06:43.820> really<00:06:44.030> well<00:06:44.380> -<00:06:45.380> that<00:06:45.530> was

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:45.620 
efficient works really well - that was

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:48.250 
efficient works really well - that was
one<00:06:45.800> cow<00:06:46.010> and<00:06:46.040> then<00:06:46.490> pierced<00:06:47.030> -<00:06:47.450> so<00:06:47.960> it<00:06:48.140> does

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:48.260 
one cow and then pierced - so it does

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:52.690 
one cow and then pierced - so it does
catch<00:06:48.500> them<00:06:49.390> pretty<00:06:50.390> well<00:06:50.480> and<00:06:51.160> I<00:06:52.160> don't<00:06:52.340> know

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:52.700 
catch them pretty well and I don't know

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.330 
catch them pretty well and I don't know
what<00:06:52.850> I<00:06:52.880> did<00:06:53.620> but<00:06:54.620> I<00:06:54.680> must<00:06:55.100> have<00:06:55.250> done

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:55.340 
what I did but I must have done

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:59.200 
what I did but I must have done
something<00:06:55.640> because<00:06:56.120> all<00:06:56.660> of<00:06:56.720> the<00:06:57.880> cows<00:06:58.880> came

00:06:59.200 --> 00:06:59.210 
something because all of the cows came

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:04.090 
something because all of the cows came
off<00:06:59.650> let's<00:07:00.650> see<00:07:00.800> what<00:07:00.980> could<00:07:01.100> happen<00:07:01.160> I<00:07:03.100> think

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:04.100 
off let's see what could happen I think

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:07.210 
off let's see what could happen I think
it's<00:07:04.550> just<00:07:04.700> it's<00:07:04.910> lagging<00:07:05.270> and<00:07:05.770> this<00:07:06.770> block

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:07.220 
it's just it's lagging and this block

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:09.820 
it's just it's lagging and this block
was<00:07:07.520> supposed<00:07:07.940> to<00:07:08.060> get<00:07:08.240> pushed<00:07:08.450> back<00:07:08.780> but<00:07:09.680> it

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:09.830 
was supposed to get pushed back but it

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:13.150 
was supposed to get pushed back but it
didn't<00:07:11.350> because<00:07:12.350> I'm<00:07:12.560> lighting<00:07:12.770> because<00:07:13.040> I'm

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:13.160 
didn't because I'm lighting because I'm

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.550 
didn't because I'm lighting because I'm
recording<00:07:13.280> this<00:07:13.820> and<00:07:14.120> because<00:07:14.480> I'm<00:07:14.600> running

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:15.560 
recording this and because I'm running

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:19.180 
recording this and because I'm running
it<00:07:15.710> at<00:07:16.330> all<00:07:17.330> the<00:07:17.570> best<00:07:17.750> settings<00:07:18.140> but<00:07:18.770> anyway

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:19.190 
it at all the best settings but anyway

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:21.910 
it at all the best settings but anyway
it<00:07:19.970> works<00:07:20.240> really<00:07:20.480> well<00:07:20.630> I'm<00:07:21.020> not<00:07:21.350> gonna<00:07:21.530> lie<00:07:21.650> I

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:21.920 
it works really well I'm not gonna lie I

00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:24.930 
it works really well I'm not gonna lie I
haven't<00:07:22.310> had<00:07:22.400> many<00:07:22.550> problems<00:07:22.850> with<00:07:23.120> it<00:07:23.330> and

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:24.940 
haven't had many problems with it and
