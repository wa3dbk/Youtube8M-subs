that<00:04:01.660> can<00:04:01.810> see<00:04:02.050> things<00:04:02.380> that<00:04:02.590> the<00:04:02.710> engineers

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
that can see things that the engineers

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.190 
that can see things that the engineers
can't<00:04:03.640> see<00:04:04.000> and<00:04:04.270> that<00:04:04.600> could<00:04:04.780> save<00:04:05.050> you

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
can't see and that could save you

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:12.630 
can't see and that could save you
