00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:06.869
 has sent me a pn and also in the 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.820
 he wrote chilly forum in that 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.960
 thread in which I am doing so yes 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.210
 and that is really true 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.229
 essential for all people as well 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.119
 want to join 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.890
 no process that is now 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.140
 completed and now changes for 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.240
 the chilies are so different you see it now 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.399
 even now they are not 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.009
 more in the greenhouse or rather 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:28.170
 the heating mat is gone now and also the 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.110
 Cover is gone because now the che need 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.640
 this really much light and the lid 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.780
 of course, the gulp down a lot 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.670
 and that's why I have the 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.560
 lamp very close to the chilies zoom 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.110
 asked you but I said that 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.820
 It would be all right so well and so too 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.920
 just the temperature you have to 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.380
 Now just win here in our climate 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.630
 and need this greenhouse effect 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.550
 not anymore and also moisture 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.530
 you do not need them now 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.060
 as much as in no process because of that 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.250
 I have to behave that too 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.350
 so far, that's what he's changing now 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.310
 Be careful that you definitely do not 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.630
 get wet 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.759
 The brand worked 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.700
 rather, they prefer to 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.469
 keep dry as too wet yes and that 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.940
 is of course a big change in 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.040
 but this whole process, too 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.690
 really important a heartfelt 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.840

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.570

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.620
 were inspired by this block and 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.359
 also started to breed nice 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.730
 but we also have people on it 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:00.730

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.049
