of this serious career focused ones I
actually<00:00:10.290> have<00:00:10.590> in<00:00:10.830> this<00:00:11.130> iPad<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:12.150> results

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
actually have in this iPad the results

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.049 
actually have in this iPad the results
of<00:00:12.690> some<00:00:12.840> pew<00:00:13.110> research<00:00:13.889> they<00:00:14.400> surveyed

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
of some pew research they surveyed

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.099 
of some pew research they surveyed
recent<00:00:15.389> college<00:00:15.570> graduates<00:00:15.929> and<00:00:15.990> they

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
recent college graduates and they

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.390 
recent college graduates and they
figured<00:00:16.350> out<00:00:16.440> what<00:00:16.710> are<00:00:16.949> some<00:00:17.190> of<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.310> things

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
figured out what are some of the things

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.800 
figured out what are some of the things
they<00:00:17.609> wish<00:00:17.760> had<00:00:17.970> they<00:00:18.090> had<00:00:18.210> done<00:00:18.390> differently

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
they wish had they had done differently

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.380 
they wish had they had done differently
or<00:00:19.080> done<00:00:19.680> more<00:00:20.039> maybe<00:00:20.400> decisions<00:00:21.029> they<00:00:21.210> wish

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
or done more maybe decisions they wish

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.849 
or done more maybe decisions they wish
they<00:00:21.570> could<00:00:21.600> reconsider<00:00:22.140> those<00:00:22.439> sorts<00:00:22.800> of

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
they could reconsider those sorts of

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.890 
they could reconsider those sorts of
things<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.310> I<00:00:23.369> think<00:00:24.180> that<00:00:24.600> we're<00:00:24.750> not<00:00:24.840> just

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
things and I think that we're not just

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.300 
things and I think that we're not just
dwelling<00:00:25.199> on<00:00:25.320> this<00:00:25.439> because<00:00:25.619> you<00:00:25.830> know<00:00:25.949> haha

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
dwelling on this because you know haha

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.009 
dwelling on this because you know haha
they<00:00:26.490> made<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.699> wrong<00:00:26.789> decisions<00:00:27.180> but<00:00:27.750> for

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
they made the wrong decisions but for

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.810 
they made the wrong decisions but for
those<00:00:28.140> of<00:00:28.320> you<00:00:28.439> who<00:00:28.590> are<00:00:28.710> still<00:00:28.949> in<00:00:29.160> college<00:00:29.429> if

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
those of you who are still in college if

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.160 
those of you who are still in college if
you<00:00:29.880> think<00:00:30.330> about<00:00:30.420> these<00:00:30.630> things<00:00:30.900> now<00:00:31.109> you

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
you think about these things now you

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.620 
you think about these things now you
might<00:00:31.740> not<00:00:31.920> have<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.399> regret<00:00:32.700> them<00:00:32.910> in<00:00:33.149> the

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
might not have to regret them in the

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.940 
might not have to regret them in the
future<00:00:33.899> so<00:00:34.079> I<00:00:34.110> think<00:00:34.230> it<00:00:34.380> could<00:00:34.469> be<00:00:34.500> useful<00:00:34.649> as

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
future so I think it could be useful as

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.770 
future so I think it could be useful as
I<00:00:35.280> said<00:00:35.460> all<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:35.640> this<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:36.000> coming<00:00:36.149> from<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.540> Pew

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
I said all of this is coming from a Pew

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.930 
I said all of this is coming from a Pew
survey<00:00:37.020> they<00:00:37.410> looked<00:00:37.590> at<00:00:37.710> 800<00:00:38.460> recent

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
survey they looked at 800 recent

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.940 
survey they looked at 800 recent
Bachelor<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:39.600> receiving<00:00:40.200> college<00:00:40.500> graduates

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
Bachelor of receiving college graduates

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.889 
Bachelor of receiving college graduates
and<00:00:41.070> they<00:00:41.520> asked<00:00:41.700> them<00:00:42.000> different<00:00:42.510> questions

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
and they asked them different questions

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.209 
and they asked them different questions
then<00:00:43.110> they<00:00:43.230> found<00:00:43.350> out<00:00:43.559> what<00:00:43.860> percent

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
then they found out what percent

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.520 
then they found out what percent
regretted<00:00:45.000> their<00:00:45.180> decision<00:00:45.629> so<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.260> first

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
regretted their decision so the first

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.639 
regretted their decision so the first
one<00:00:46.820> gaining<00:00:47.820> more<00:00:48.059> work<00:00:48.390> experience<00:00:48.539> a<00:00:49.289> full

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
one gaining more work experience a full

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.700 
one gaining more work experience a full
50%<00:00:50.280> of<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.910> people<00:00:51.059> responding<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.780> pew<00:00:52.170> say

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
50% of the people responding to pew say

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.900 
50% of the people responding to pew say
that<00:00:52.829> they<00:00:52.949> wish<00:00:53.100> they'd<00:00:53.250> gotten<00:00:53.460> more<00:00:53.699> work

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
that they wish they'd gotten more work

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.939 
that they wish they'd gotten more work
experience<00:00:54.140> when<00:00:55.140> they<00:00:55.289> were<00:00:55.379> in<00:00:55.500> college<00:00:55.829> and

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
experience when they were in college and

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:56.779 
experience when they were in college and
I<00:00:56.039> think<00:00:56.219> that<00:00:56.340> there's<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.520> very<00:00:56.670> good<00:00:56.699> reason

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
I think that there's a very good reason

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.119 
I think that there's a very good reason
for<00:00:57.239> this<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.539> it's<00:00:57.629> not<00:00:57.870> that<00:00:58.170> they<00:00:58.800> think

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
for this and it's not that they think

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.139 
for this and it's not that they think
that<00:00:59.280> they<00:00:59.399> would<00:00:59.489> have<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.640> better<00:00:59.820> chance<00:00:59.879> of

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
that they would have a better chance of

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.549 
that they would have a better chance of
getting<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.480> job<00:01:00.510> if<00:01:00.960> they<00:01:01.050> had<00:01:01.170> more<00:01:01.289> work

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
getting a job if they had more work

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:02.869 
getting a job if they had more work
experience<00:01:01.710> I'm<00:01:02.219> sure<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:02.460> wouldn't<00:01:02.670> hurt

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
experience I'm sure that wouldn't hurt

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.490 
experience I'm sure that wouldn't hurt
but<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:03.359> think<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.690> reason<00:01:04.110> they<00:01:04.199> wish<00:01:04.350> they

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
but I think the reason they wish they

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.859 
but I think the reason they wish they
had<00:01:04.530> more<00:01:04.619> work<00:01:04.920> experience<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:05.729> all<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.689> time

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
had more work experience is all the time

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.120 
had more work experience is all the time
that<00:01:07.020> we're<00:01:07.140> in<00:01:07.260> college<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:07.830> know<00:01:07.860> we're

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
that we're in college you know we're

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.649 
that we're in college you know we're
figuring<00:01:08.310> out<00:01:08.580> our<00:01:08.700> major<00:01:08.939> we're<00:01:09.299> trying<00:01:09.600> to

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
figuring out our major we're trying to

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:10.850 
figuring out our major we're trying to
figure<00:01:09.900> out<00:01:09.960> what<00:01:10.170> kind<00:01:10.320> of<00:01:10.350> job<00:01:10.590> we're<00:01:10.770> going

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
figure out what kind of job we're going

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.429 
figure out what kind of job we're going
to<00:01:10.950> have<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.490> it's<00:01:12.119> almost<00:01:12.540> purely<00:01:13.140> sort<00:01:13.380> of

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
to have and it's almost purely sort of

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.289 
to have and it's almost purely sort of
hypothetical<00:01:13.710> like<00:01:14.280> what<00:01:14.820> would<00:01:14.970> it<00:01:15.060> be<00:01:15.119> like

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
hypothetical like what would it be like

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.749 
hypothetical like what would it be like
to<00:01:15.990> be<00:01:16.140> in<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.439> field<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:17.040> you're<00:01:17.460> thinking

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
to be in that field and you're thinking

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:18.980 
to be in that field and you're thinking
about<00:01:17.909> sort<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.240> money<00:01:18.450> you'd<00:01:18.600> make<00:01:18.780> and

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
about sort of the money you'd make and

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.780 
about sort of the money you'd make and
stuff<00:01:19.200> like<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.530> but<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.100> don't<00:01:20.220> know<00:01:20.340> what

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
stuff like that but you don't know what

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.730 
stuff like that but you don't know what
it<00:01:20.880> would<00:01:20.939> actually<00:01:21.299> be<00:01:21.450> like<00:01:21.479> but<00:01:22.380> if<00:01:22.530> you<00:01:22.619> had

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
it would actually be like but if you had

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.499 
it would actually be like but if you had
some<00:01:22.950> work<00:01:23.189> experience<00:01:23.759> if<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:23.970> did<00:01:24.150> sort<00:01:24.450> of

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
some work experience if you did sort of

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.929 
some work experience if you did sort of
shadowing<00:01:25.020> or<00:01:25.350> an<00:01:25.799> internship<00:01:26.159> or<00:01:26.670> something

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
shadowing or an internship or something

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:27.469 
shadowing or an internship or something
like<00:01:27.060> that

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
like that

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:28.670 
like that
in<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.720> field<00:01:27.960> that<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.259> want<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.470> get<00:01:28.530> into

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
in the field that you want to get into

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.830 
in the field that you want to get into
then<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.340> actually<00:01:29.790> have<00:01:29.880> much<00:01:30.119> more<00:01:30.360> go<00:01:30.630> on

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
then you actually have much more go on

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.050 
then you actually have much more go on
and<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.380> think<00:01:31.619> that<00:01:31.740> if<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:32.070> just<00:01:32.340> go<00:01:32.579> get<00:01:32.880> your

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
and I think that if you just go get your

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.120 
and I think that if you just go get your
degree<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.630> then<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.049> get<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.229> job<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.829> you

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
degree and then you get a job and you

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.039 
degree and then you get a job and you
might<00:01:35.460> well<00:01:35.729> regret<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.360> job<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:36.840> get

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
might well regret the job that you get

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.510 
might well regret the job that you get
because<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.619> didn't<00:01:37.920> know<00:01:38.009> what<00:01:38.189> it<00:01:38.280> would<00:01:38.369> be

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
because you didn't know what it would be

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.670 
because you didn't know what it would be
like<00:01:38.570> beforehand<00:01:39.570> now<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.020> second<00:01:40.470> one<00:01:40.619> is

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
like beforehand now the second one is

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.359 
like beforehand now the second one is
studying<00:01:41.640> harder<00:01:42.170> 38%<00:01:43.170> of<00:01:43.350> those<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:44.100> Pew

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
studying harder 38% of those that Pew

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.039 
studying harder 38% of those that Pew
polled<00:01:44.759> said<00:01:45.299> they<00:01:45.360> wish<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.659> they<00:01:45.840> had

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
polled said they wish that they had

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.389 
polled said they wish that they had
studied<00:01:46.320> harder<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:46.920> I'm<00:01:47.009> not<00:01:47.159> really

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
studied harder and I'm not really

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.569 
studied harder and I'm not really
surprised<00:01:47.970> by<00:01:48.960> this<00:01:49.020> no<00:01:49.680> no<00:01:49.979> it's<00:01:50.250> not<00:01:50.520> a

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
surprised by this no no it's not a

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.609 
surprised by this no no it's not a
majority<00:01:50.759> or<00:01:51.090> anything<00:01:51.329> but<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.049> think<00:01:52.409> that

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
majority or anything but I think that

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.130 
majority or anything but I think that
it's<00:01:53.220> as<00:01:53.490> easy<00:01:53.670> as<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.149> is<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.509> say<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:54.780> you

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
it's as easy as it is to say that you

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.469 
it's as easy as it is to say that you
know<00:01:55.259> your<00:01:55.439> job<00:01:55.680> doesn't<00:01:56.070> directly<00:01:56.700> do<00:01:56.850> isn't

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
know your job doesn't directly do isn't

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.510 
know your job doesn't directly do isn't
directly<00:01:57.810> determined<00:01:58.259> by<00:01:58.530> your<00:01:58.740> grades<00:01:59.189> which

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
directly determined by your grades which

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.880 
directly determined by your grades which
is<00:01:59.670> totally<00:02:00.090> true<00:02:00.119> I<00:02:00.630> do<00:02:01.079> think<00:02:01.530> that<00:02:01.590> it's

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
is totally true I do think that it's

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.859 
is totally true I do think that it's
easy<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.310> look<00:02:02.430> back<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:02.880> say<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.119> know<00:02:03.240> I<00:02:03.540> had

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
easy to look back and say you know I had

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.870 
easy to look back and say you know I had
a<00:02:03.899> lot<00:02:04.079> of<00:02:04.110> fun<00:02:04.469> I<00:02:04.710> went<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:05.100> parties<00:02:05.549> I<00:02:05.579> hang

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
a lot of fun I went to parties I hang

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.550 
a lot of fun I went to parties I hang
out<00:02:05.969> my<00:02:06.240> friends<00:02:06.719> you<00:02:06.840> know<00:02:06.930> maybe<00:02:07.110> I<00:02:07.229> worked

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
out my friends you know maybe I worked

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.770 
out my friends you know maybe I worked
and<00:02:07.770> stuff<00:02:07.979> like<00:02:08.099> that<00:02:08.340> but<00:02:08.970> it's<00:02:09.270> easy<00:02:09.599> to

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
and stuff like that but it's easy to

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.199 
and stuff like that but it's easy to
like<00:02:10.020> say<00:02:10.319> I<00:02:10.590> didn't<00:02:11.400> need<00:02:11.580> as

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
like say I didn't need as

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.839 
like say I didn't need as
a<00:02:12.239> bit<00:02:12.480> as<00:02:12.629> I<00:02:12.900> had<00:02:13.200> and<00:02:13.469> perhaps<00:02:13.680> if<00:02:14.310> I<00:02:14.519> worked<00:02:14.790> a

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
a bit as I had and perhaps if I worked a

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:17.000 
a bit as I had and perhaps if I worked a
little<00:02:14.969> bit<00:02:15.120> harder<00:02:15.180> than<00:02:15.689> the<00:02:16.409> final<00:02:16.859> like

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
little bit harder than the final like

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.130 
little bit harder than the final like
sort<00:02:17.250> of<00:02:17.280> GPA<00:02:17.670> that<00:02:17.879> you<00:02:18.000> have<00:02:18.180> like<00:02:18.810> it's<00:02:18.959> easy

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
sort of GPA that you have like it's easy

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.750 
sort of GPA that you have like it's easy
to<00:02:19.230> look<00:02:19.349> at<00:02:19.469> that<00:02:19.500> and<00:02:19.680> say<00:02:19.799> man<00:02:20.099> how<00:02:20.400> could<00:02:20.640> I

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
to look at that and say man how could I

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.089 
to look at that and say man how could I
change<00:02:21.120> it<00:02:21.390> in<00:02:21.480> an<00:02:21.569> easy<00:02:21.810> way<00:02:21.989> it's<00:02:22.650> possibly

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
change it in an easy way it's possibly

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:24.530 
change it in an easy way it's possibly
studying<00:02:23.459> harder<00:02:23.760> so<00:02:24.180> I'm<00:02:24.239> not<00:02:24.390> really

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
studying harder so I'm not really

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.059 
studying harder so I'm not really
surprised<00:02:25.049> by<00:02:25.290> that<00:02:25.439> number<00:02:25.500> but<00:02:25.890> it<00:02:25.980> is

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
surprised by that number but it is

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.709 
surprised by that number but it is
something<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.489> bear<00:02:26.640> in<00:02:26.730> mind<00:02:26.790> perhaps<00:02:27.359> you

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:27.719 
something to bear in mind perhaps you

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:29.479 
something to bear in mind perhaps you
know<00:02:27.840> a<00:02:28.019> little<00:02:28.409> bit<00:02:28.590> less<00:02:28.799> hanging<00:02:29.189> out<00:02:29.280> a

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
know a little bit less hanging out a

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.009 
know a little bit less hanging out a
little<00:02:29.879> bit<00:02:30.090> less<00:02:30.239> partying<00:02:30.659> a<00:02:30.689> little<00:02:30.810> bit

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
little bit less partying a little bit

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:32.899 
little bit less partying a little bit
less<00:02:31.170> working<00:02:31.590> on<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:31.769> side<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.250> a<00:02:32.760> little

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
less working on the side and a little

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:34.220 
less working on the side and a little
bit<00:02:33.090> more<00:02:33.329> hit<00:02:33.540> in<00:02:33.629> the<00:02:33.689> books<00:02:33.870> probably

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
bit more hit in the books probably

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.619 
bit more hit in the books probably
really<00:02:34.769> related<00:02:35.189> the<00:02:35.340> first<00:02:35.609> one<00:02:35.849> is<00:02:36.090> looking

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
really related the first one is looking

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:39.140 
really related the first one is looking
for<00:02:36.689> work<00:02:37.139> sooner<00:02:37.769> 30%<00:02:38.519> of<00:02:38.639> those<00:02:38.760> pupils

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
for work sooner 30% of those pupils

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.059 
for work sooner 30% of those pupils
saying<00:02:39.719> they<00:02:40.200> wish<00:02:40.439> that<00:02:40.650> they<00:02:40.739> had<00:02:40.859> looked

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
saying they wish that they had looked

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.099 
saying they wish that they had looked
for<00:02:41.549> work<00:02:41.700> a<00:02:41.879> little<00:02:42.000> bit<00:02:42.209> earlier<00:02:42.569> in<00:02:42.659> their

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:43.109 
for work a little bit earlier in their

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:45.170 
for work a little bit earlier in their
career<00:02:43.650> now<00:02:44.040> I<00:02:44.069> think<00:02:44.250> that<00:02:44.669> is<00:02:44.819> as<00:02:45.060> I

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
career now I think that is as I

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.849 
career now I think that is as I
explained<00:02:45.540> in<00:02:45.659> the<00:02:45.720> first<00:02:45.870> one<00:02:46.230> because<00:02:46.620> you

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:46.859 
explained in the first one because you

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:48.409 
explained in the first one because you
know<00:02:46.980> then<00:02:47.159> maybe<00:02:47.790> they<00:02:47.970> would<00:02:48.060> have<00:02:48.209> a<00:02:48.269> better

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:48.419 
know then maybe they would have a better

00:02:48.419 --> 00:02:50.059 
know then maybe they would have a better
idea<00:02:48.510> idea<00:02:49.049> of<00:02:49.230> what<00:02:49.379> those<00:02:49.439> jobs<00:02:49.829> would<00:02:50.010> be

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
idea idea of what those jobs would be

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:51.800 
idea idea of what those jobs would be
like<00:02:50.400> but<00:02:50.819> I<00:02:50.849> think<00:02:51.030> it<00:02:51.120> goes<00:02:51.209> a<00:02:51.389> little<00:02:51.659> bit

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
like but I think it goes a little bit

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.979 
like but I think it goes a little bit
beyond<00:02:52.290> that<00:02:52.439> I<00:02:52.709> think<00:02:52.739> that<00:02:53.299> it's<00:02:54.299> easy<00:02:54.659> in

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
beyond that I think that it's easy in

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.780 
beyond that I think that it's easy in
college<00:02:55.470> especially<00:02:55.590> in<00:02:56.040> your<00:02:56.159> last<00:02:56.430> year

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
college especially in your last year

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.369 
college especially in your last year
when<00:02:57.000> you<00:02:57.120> know<00:02:57.239> you<00:02:57.599> have<00:02:57.689> to<00:02:57.810> finish<00:02:57.989> up<00:02:58.260> your

00:02:58.369 --> 00:02:58.379 
when you know you have to finish up your

00:02:58.379 --> 00:02:59.929 
when you know you have to finish up your
classes<00:02:58.799> maybe<00:02:58.950> there's<00:02:59.219> some<00:02:59.340> gen<00:02:59.549> Ed's<00:02:59.730> that

00:02:59.929 --> 00:02:59.939 
classes maybe there's some gen Ed's that

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:01.940 
classes maybe there's some gen Ed's that
you<00:03:00.090> didn't<00:03:00.269> get<00:03:00.359> earlier<00:03:00.659> on<00:03:00.900> like<00:03:01.530> you<00:03:01.680> want

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
you didn't get earlier on like you want

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.039 
you didn't get earlier on like you want
to<00:03:02.010> finish<00:03:02.250> up<00:03:02.519> those<00:03:02.760> exams<00:03:03.359> and<00:03:03.719> stuff<00:03:03.900> like

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
to finish up those exams and stuff like

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:05.839 
to finish up those exams and stuff like
that<00:03:04.260> and<00:03:04.469> so<00:03:04.829> you<00:03:04.859> get<00:03:04.980> so<00:03:05.219> caught<00:03:05.430> up<00:03:05.489> in<00:03:05.700> that

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849 
that and so you get so caught up in that

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:08.509 
that and so you get so caught up in that
and<00:03:06.060> then<00:03:06.599> you<00:03:06.750> graduate<00:03:07.290> and<00:03:07.500> you<00:03:07.919> celebrate

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
and then you graduate and you celebrate

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.000 
and then you graduate and you celebrate
and<00:03:08.669> then<00:03:08.939> you're<00:03:09.090> out<00:03:09.209> there<00:03:09.510> and<00:03:10.010> you're

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
and then you're out there and you're

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.309 
and then you're out there and you're
just<00:03:11.069> wondering<00:03:11.340> what<00:03:11.669> to<00:03:11.790> do<00:03:11.939> and<00:03:12.239> if<00:03:13.139> you

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
just wondering what to do and if you

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:14.899 
just wondering what to do and if you
haven't<00:03:13.590> prepared<00:03:14.280> if<00:03:14.459> you<00:03:14.549> haven't<00:03:14.849> already

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:14.909 
haven't prepared if you haven't already

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:16.670 
haven't prepared if you haven't already
started<00:03:15.090> looking<00:03:15.689> you<00:03:16.109> know<00:03:16.199> going<00:03:16.349> to<00:03:16.440> job

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
started looking you know going to job

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:19.069 
started looking you know going to job
fairs<00:03:17.040> and<00:03:17.250> stuff<00:03:17.489> like<00:03:17.609> that<00:03:17.819> then<00:03:18.359> it's<00:03:18.750> easy

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
fairs and stuff like that then it's easy

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:21.619 
fairs and stuff like that then it's easy
to<00:03:19.260> feel<00:03:19.440> like<00:03:19.650> you're<00:03:19.859> sort<00:03:20.040> of<00:03:20.159> why<00:03:20.790> didn't<00:03:21.510> I

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:21.629 
to feel like you're sort of why didn't I

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:23.960 
to feel like you're sort of why didn't I
do<00:03:21.690> more<00:03:22.139> at<00:03:22.349> that<00:03:22.530> point<00:03:22.859> and<00:03:23.129> so<00:03:23.639> I<00:03:23.669> don't

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
do more at that point and so I don't

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.699 
do more at that point and so I don't
think<00:03:24.180> that<00:03:24.299> it's<00:03:24.419> necessarily<00:03:24.930> required

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
think that it's necessarily required

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:27.439 
think that it's necessarily required
that<00:03:26.159> you<00:03:26.310> start<00:03:26.579> looking<00:03:26.849> for<00:03:27.060> work<00:03:27.209> during

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:27.449 
that you start looking for work during

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:29.270 
that you start looking for work during
your<00:03:27.659> senior<00:03:27.930> year<00:03:28.139> or<00:03:28.260> even<00:03:28.379> earlier<00:03:28.799> but<00:03:29.250> I

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
your senior year or even earlier but I

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.920 
your senior year or even earlier but I
certainly<00:03:29.519> don't<00:03:29.879> think<00:03:30.000> that<00:03:30.419> it<00:03:30.510> would<00:03:30.629> hurt

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
certainly don't think that it would hurt

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.780 
certainly don't think that it would hurt
I<00:03:31.139> think<00:03:31.620> that<00:03:31.769> it<00:03:31.859> would<00:03:32.010> benefit<00:03:32.430> you<00:03:32.579> in<00:03:32.699> the

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
I think that it would benefit you in the

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:33.710 
I think that it would benefit you in the
way<00:03:32.879> that<00:03:32.909> I<00:03:33.090> talked<00:03:33.269> about<00:03:33.329> in<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:33.599> first

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
way that I talked about in the first

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.869 
way that I talked about in the first
part<00:03:33.989> but<00:03:34.530> also<00:03:34.709> like<00:03:35.129> you<00:03:35.280> wouldn't<00:03:35.639> feel<00:03:35.699> as

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:35.879 
part but also like you wouldn't feel as

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:39.259 
part but also like you wouldn't feel as

been rethinking your choice of a major
career<00:04:06.060> field<00:04:06.359> then<00:04:06.810> you<00:04:06.930> might<00:04:07.079> say<00:04:07.229> oh<00:04:07.379> my

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
career field then you might say oh my

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.140 
career field then you might say oh my
god<00:04:07.769> a<00:04:07.799> lot<00:04:08.159> of<00:04:08.250> other<00:04:08.400> people<00:04:08.669> are<00:04:08.790> doing<00:04:09.030> it

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
god a lot of other people are doing it

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.270 
god a lot of other people are doing it
and<00:04:09.269> that's<00:04:09.780> true<00:04:10.169> but<00:04:10.650> again<00:04:10.859> it's<00:04:11.009> not<00:04:11.189> an

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
and that's true but again it's not an

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.280 
and that's true but again it's not an
overwhelming<00:04:11.519> number<00:04:12.120> it's<00:04:12.359> not<00:04:12.659> a<00:04:12.720> majority

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
overwhelming number it's not a majority

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.229 
overwhelming number it's not a majority
or<00:04:13.319> anything<00:04:13.590> like<00:04:13.889> that<00:04:13.949> I<00:04:14.400> think<00:04:14.759> that<00:04:15.120> it's

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
or anything like that I think that it's

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.300 
or anything like that I think that it's
only<00:04:15.389> natural<00:04:15.689> to<00:04:16.259> sort<00:04:16.530> of<00:04:16.620> as<00:04:16.829> you<00:04:17.190> get

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
only natural to sort of as you get

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.620 
only natural to sort of as you get
towards<00:04:17.639> the<00:04:17.699> end<00:04:17.789> of<00:04:18.030> it<00:04:18.180> to<00:04:18.299> think<00:04:18.539> about

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
towards the end of it to think about

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.420 
towards the end of it to think about
what<00:04:18.930> you<00:04:19.019> could<00:04:19.199> have<00:04:19.229> done<00:04:19.320> it's<00:04:20.130> sort<00:04:20.370> of

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
what you could have done it's sort of

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.219 
what you could have done it's sort of
similar<00:04:20.609> to<00:04:20.789> when<00:04:21.539> you<00:04:21.630> finally<00:04:21.870> choose<00:04:22.169> a

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
similar to when you finally choose a

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.529 
similar to when you finally choose a
line<00:04:22.650> to<00:04:23.130> check<00:04:23.370> out<00:04:23.520> in<00:04:23.669> a<00:04:23.760> supermarket<00:04:24.419> and

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
line to check out in a supermarket and

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:25.129 
line to check out in a supermarket and
then<00:04:24.960> you

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:25.139 
then you

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:26.809 
then you
look<00:04:25.229> around<00:04:25.349> you're<00:04:26.039> almost<00:04:26.159> always<00:04:26.520> going

00:04:26.809 --> 00:04:26.819 
look around you're almost always going

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:28.189 
look around you're almost always going
to<00:04:26.909> see<00:04:27.150> one<00:04:27.360> that<00:04:27.509> looks<00:04:27.569> like<00:04:27.810> it's<00:04:28.020> moving

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199 
to see one that looks like it's moving

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:29.959 
to see one that looks like it's moving
faster<00:04:28.740> because<00:04:29.069> you're<00:04:29.280> only<00:04:29.430> in<00:04:29.610> one<00:04:29.789> and

00:04:29.959 --> 00:04:29.969 
faster because you're only in one and

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:31.339 
faster because you're only in one and
there's<00:04:30.090> nine<00:04:30.360> other<00:04:30.569> possibilities<00:04:31.199> if

00:04:31.339 --> 00:04:31.349 
there's nine other possibilities if

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:34.010 
there's nine other possibilities if
you've<00:04:32.069> settled<00:04:32.639> on<00:04:32.819> English<00:04:33.090> literature<00:04:33.539> but

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
you've settled on English literature but

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.739 
you've settled on English literature but
you<00:04:34.139> were<00:04:34.259> curious<00:04:34.560> about<00:04:34.889> biology<00:04:35.039> and

00:04:35.739 --> 00:04:35.749 
you were curious about biology and

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:38.179 
you were curious about biology and
engineering<00:04:36.749> and<00:04:36.930> political<00:04:37.409> science<00:04:37.740> then

00:04:38.179 --> 00:04:38.189 
engineering and political science then

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:39.980 
engineering and political science then
all<00:04:38.520> of<00:04:38.550> those<00:04:39.029> things<00:04:39.419> you<00:04:39.599> could<00:04:39.840> have<00:04:39.900> done

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
all of those things you could have done

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:41.689 
all of those things you could have done
sort<00:04:40.439> of<00:04:40.499> add<00:04:40.680> up<00:04:40.710> in<00:04:40.979> your<00:04:41.129> mind<00:04:41.370> and<00:04:41.520> it<00:04:41.580> can

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:41.699 
sort of add up in your mind and it can

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:44.390 
sort of add up in your mind and it can
be<00:04:41.819> pretty<00:04:42.029> intimidating<00:04:42.719> but<00:04:43.529> remember<00:04:44.249> at

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
be pretty intimidating but remember at

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.850 
be pretty intimidating but remember at
that<00:04:44.430> point<00:04:44.580> why<00:04:45.210> you<00:04:45.270> chose<00:04:45.749> the<00:04:46.349> major<00:04:46.590> you

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
that point why you chose the major you

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.830 
that point why you chose the major you
did<00:04:47.099> and<00:04:47.340> and<00:04:48.029> don't<00:04:48.180> second-guess<00:04:48.719> yourself

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
did and and don't second-guess yourself

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.760 
did and and don't second-guess yourself
if<00:04:49.469> you<00:04:49.740> are<00:04:49.770> happy<00:04:50.460> in<00:04:50.550> general<00:04:50.759> terms<00:04:51.180> now

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
to put a little bit of extra thought

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.670 
to put a little bit of extra thought
into<00:05:00.330> your<00:05:00.419> major<00:05:00.569> think<00:05:00.990> about<00:05:01.199> why<00:05:01.409> you're

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
into your major think about why you're

money<00:05:03.750> is<00:05:03.990> it<00:05:04.560> because<00:05:04.830> you<00:05:04.979> feel<00:05:05.159> pressure

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
money is it because you feel pressure

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.490 
money is it because you feel pressure
from<00:05:05.669> your<00:05:05.789> family<00:05:06.210> or<00:05:06.330> is<00:05:06.930> it<00:05:07.110> because<00:05:07.229> you're

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
from your family or is it because you're

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.469
