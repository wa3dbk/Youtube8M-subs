00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.680
 Welcome to 1 september 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.080
 favorites and I start directly 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.980
 with my favorite and that's the one 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.590
 Base 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.350
 Mr. Phoenix Foundation and this 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.020
 foundation is really good there 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.000
 not too much covers and a lot 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.280
 healthy finish on the skin leaves 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.780
 So she already covers but it sees 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.210
 do not look like your face too 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.550
 clapped and that's why I have this 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.410
 month september very much made for 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.260
 next favorite is then dicaprio 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.300
 meat cream and some know 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.340
 maybe from kiko the camouflage cream 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.980
 or the mac studios finish concealer 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.930
 and with whom can the katrins 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.360
 camouflage would really keep up there 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.850
 you pimple the strongest dark circles and 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.070
 even scars partially super good covering 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.530
 and I'll just show you how 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.869
 she works for me and yes I am very 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.020
 happy with it and I have the 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.210
 Astor Karin Schwarz likes to do it 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.280
 this month and then I have 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.170
 actually used mainly for this purpose 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.780
 him on my lower and upper 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.040
 apply eyelash wreath around this 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.830
 just a little more 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.450
 to give definition we want to see 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.159
 can I show you again how I 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.890
 use all the products because I 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.810
 It's nice if you do that again 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.790
 bit shows why you like it 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.270
 and the next thing you become the 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.159
 date up and from katies and that 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.960
 it's such a little highlighter pen and 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.840
 I personally always use it 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.090
 my inner eye angle a bit 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.100
 brighter and this little bit 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.200
 make it look fresher and more 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.030
 I just drive over with the pen 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.619
 my inner eye angle and you see 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.210
 yes that this very strong 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.040
 pigmented is very much color to us 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.400
 give up but you can also do it 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:08.420
 use eyebrows 80 to lift or 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:13.079
 to let your eyes shine for 111 ii 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:15.630
 yes, the next mascara I'll give you here 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:18.570
 show is the mascara of benefit 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.650
 and this has been very much and 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.870
 I thought I would try it 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.519
 Just look it yourself and I am 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.030
 really very very happy with 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:26.310
 their 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.280
 she separates the kumpan exactly and 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.569
 makes a great volume 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.120
 and I think that's the point, too 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.620
 this mascara itself of theory and 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.140
 I think the breakdowns should look like 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.030
 like wrong but they are real and here 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.010
 do you look at that with and without comparison 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.350
 my eyelashes and i really can 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:46.390
 only wholeheartedly recommend and 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.390
 I'll buy it myself too 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.830
 yes the next favorite are the eos with 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.600
 Bars and I think these are one of the 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.760
 Mostly in the product like here on 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.220
 youtube dissing these little rounds 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.850
 libdems that really 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.739
 are moisturizing and unfortunately 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:04.100
 only available in the usa or online 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:06.320
 So you have to order them online 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.570
 because you can not find the net 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.760
 as well as the mary lou men of that 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:13.370
 tree and that is a really strong one 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.630
 pigmented brother highlighter and 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.120
 I have that too in me 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.860
 Ordered internet and you need it for that 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.500
 really as I said a small amount 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.239
 on a brush and you can do that 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.550
 then start marrying your face 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:28.220
 and eurobank still sting out 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.470
 let and yes that was all mine 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.180
 favorites for the month of september i 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.530
