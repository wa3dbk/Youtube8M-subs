00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.500
 Ionic Bond. 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.300
 Sodium chloride. 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:39.500
 The ionic bond is the transfer of electrons from a metal atom to a non-metallic atom. 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.700
 Let me take sodium chloride as an example. 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.000
 sodium. 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:22.000
 The atomic number of sodium is 11 and the electronic composition is 2,8,1. 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.000
 Sodium has an extra electron in the outer shell. 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.900
 Chlorine. 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:57.500
 The atomic number of chlorine is 17 and its electron composition is 2,8,7. 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 Chlorine has 7 electrons in the outer shell. 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:26.000
 The chlorine needs 1 electron to complete the outer shell. 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:49.300
 When sodium reacts with chlorine, sodium contributes the electron to chlorine. 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.100
 Sodium becomes a positively charged ion. 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.500
 Chlorine accepts the electron from sodium. 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.400
 Chlorine becomes a negatively charged ion. 

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:32.500
 Sodium ions and chloride are charged by a strong electrical force of attraction known as ion bond. 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.500
 Sodium chloride. 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000
 End.
