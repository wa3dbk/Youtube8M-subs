 then they will all be concentrated because they cause sustained winds from their 

00:00:16.489 --> 00:00:19.489
 vehicles under that age around the world 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:23.710
 certainly at the end of the twentieth 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.150
 the team did the same thing happened the optical event copa-cogeca approaching 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.640
 she is little by little we have many options 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.090
 we want to arrive when the campaign started in the treatment 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.820
 however and if then one of the world tennis after what we are 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.540
 a conflict between Moscow and September last encounters 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.639
 both states mostly ready for this Sunday 

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:52.799
 knowing movistar conquering some red sports car 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.810
 prob 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:06.980
 of course the next game I have a great appreciation 3 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.160
 johnson I'm sure he's a convinced the Japanese and 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.340
 Americans argue that the most famous actors associated with 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.329
 detergents opportunity to participate in no sense keep pace 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.120
 but except the first one because they are close 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.210
 When I finished the nuclear race, the earthlings did not save them. 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.410
 to refuse 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.310
 the president the inter of Milan as 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.480
 as little 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.480
 other experts as a difficult condition Bogotá 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.380
 we know 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.719
 cúcuta cartagena continent except whistle context because they fear for the 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:51.130
 unesco as a reserve as the three parts of the entity in delicate 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.310
 an institution with more intensity 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.750
 here we are with excessive deficit 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:06.819
 if the one that is 

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:09.819
 he was a common old friend surely he 

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:14.049
 between the results of the marginalization index 

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:18.089
 velvet the race will start the 20 seconds good luck to all 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.019
 a childish mistake 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:40.579
 but he did not know how to solve 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.239
 finally the white and navy blue leader 

00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:49.929
 well done your job as you knew 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:53.899
 blanchflower green notes say first that you should answer 

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:55.549
 the clearest case 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:58.679
 we approach these rates 

00:02:58.679 --> 00:03:01.299
 nolan who has behind us 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.799
 min 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:05.769
 of animation forgotten 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.759
 I feel very good 

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:11.759
 - September 15 we have to talk 

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:16.789
 in this sense the fmi 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:24.699
 We are talking 

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:25.949
 It's not a surprise 

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:28.949
 the second group 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.869
 there is not a single minute 

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:37.169
 thanks for the warning venus 

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:39.469
 We have achieved it 

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:41.639
 we will do later on the flight 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:44.639
 without them it would not be bad that the team is also the others 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:45.789
 Projects 

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:48.250
 do not worry last releases 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.360
 there is already a signal that he 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.139
 light of the world your results 

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:54.899
 in general 

00:03:54.899 --> 00:03:55.990
 - do not 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:58.990
 so win yes or yes 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:13.359
 the nation 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:20.339
 We wanted many of the attendees points concluded pointed out 

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:37.069
 c 

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:38.259
 Beer 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:41.259
 the footballers stars is correct 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.699
 his contracting finally there is wind of head 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.900
 French 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.889
 Within the group 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:08.889
 its responsible 

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:16.150
 Juan Carlos Moreno 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.150
 He pointed out that these reports do not 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.460
 4 

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:27.020
 In an interview 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.339
 is a beautiful clown from the difficult part 

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:32.659
 one of the largest in europe 

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:35.719
 nothing better than a rugged road that analyzes the mountains 

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:39.770
 the snow is very deep and it will be difficult field 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:42.770
 signed passages 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:48.330
 that space to lead the national committee 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:51.400
 the truck and it's very natural 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.400
 the millionaire 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:06:01.969
 it may seem that the different environments between tigers that are not 

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:03.289
 exists 

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:06.289
 the upward rates 

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:08.569
 true to his style 

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:11.569
 wilson are required to be directed 

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:15.759
 recover 

00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:26.999
 and today we have shown 

00:06:26.999 --> 00:06:28.809
 gonzález 

00:06:28.809 --> 00:06:32.120
 optimus we are too big to pass these cars 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.120
 If not, we are the 

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:39.159
 2 but be careful what the voter registry 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:41.990
 Mrs 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:44.990
 the fake 

00:06:46.779 --> 00:06:48.060
 he added 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.060
 raceqi 

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:03.059
 that's not fair is not firing the gravity laws of this reality 

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:10.520
 televise 

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:14.759
 13 

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.430
 will look was well planned 

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:21.409
 how they knew we would be here 

00:07:21.409 --> 00:07:24.330
 they were also who is who has their system infected 

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:29.379
 and they thought that we would have to look for it is nonsense so far it seems that 

00:07:29.379 --> 00:07:31.960
 we all came to the 10 guests of honor 

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.990
 where they are registered 

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:37.999
 attention seems to pop culture 

00:07:37.999 --> 00:07:40.509
 excuse me 

00:07:40.509 --> 00:07:41.830
 today is the last 

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:42.949
 yes and c's 

00:07:42.949 --> 00:07:45.949
 the counselors per month 

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:50.550
 the martino block who thought that the law 

00:07:51.259 --> 00:07:52.690
 in the center of bogota 

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:53.770
 with this work 

00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:56.770
 we have another problem here you have to match 

00:07:58.149 --> 00:08:01.719
 the organizers escape a barometer to measure poverty 

00:08:03.369 --> 00:08:04.339
 carlos pavón 

00:08:04.339 --> 00:08:06.749
 when we think a lot of value 

00:08:06.749 --> 00:08:07.519
 Conversely
