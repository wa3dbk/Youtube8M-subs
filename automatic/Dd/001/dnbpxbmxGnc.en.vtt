to the drag link on this end and over on
this<00:00:35.510> end<00:00:35.860> get<00:00:36.860> that<00:00:37.040> L<00:00:37.160> bracket<00:00:37.720> which<00:00:38.720> bolts

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.110 
this end get that L bracket which bolts

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.639 
this end get that L bracket which bolts
on<00:00:39.230> to<00:00:39.500> the<00:00:39.620> area<00:00:40.220> worthy<00:00:40.579> rear<00:00:41.410> skid<00:00:42.410> plate

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:45.760 
on to the area worthy rear skid plate
bolts<00:00:43.690> so<00:00:44.690> I'm<00:00:44.809> at<00:00:45.050> the<00:00:45.230> front<00:00:45.470> looking

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
bolts so I'm at the front looking

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.360 
bolts so I'm at the front looking
towards<00:00:46.220> back<00:00:46.430> and<00:00:47.890> it's<00:00:48.890> been<00:00:49.040> kind<00:00:49.280> of

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
towards back and it's been kind of

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.810 
towards back and it's been kind of
helpful<00:00:49.550> I<00:00:49.899> don't<00:00:50.899> think<00:00:51.399> I've<00:00:52.399> solved<00:00:52.790> my

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
helpful I don't think I've solved my

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:59.170 
helpful I don't think I've solved my
problem<00:00:54.309> so<00:00:56.079> let's<00:00:57.079> get<00:00:57.230> to<00:00:57.380> the<00:00:57.410> important<00:00:58.180> if

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
problem so let's get to the important if

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.500 
problem so let's get to the important if
you<00:00:59.270> look<00:00:59.420> at<00:00:59.510> the<00:00:59.600> drag<00:00:59.840> link<00:01:01.210> see<00:01:02.210> how<00:01:02.300> that

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
you look at the drag link see how that

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.840 
you look at the drag link see how that
babe<00:01:02.690> is<00:01:02.870> curved<00:01:03.670> typically<00:01:04.670> they're

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
babe is curved typically they're

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.319 
babe is curved typically they're
straight<00:01:05.149> so<00:01:05.899> when<00:01:06.079> a<00:01:06.109> force<00:01:06.819> the<00:01:07.819> sideways

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:08.329 
straight so when a force the sideways

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:12.910 
straight so when a force the sideways
force<00:01:08.659> on<00:01:08.899> the<00:01:09.020> wheel<00:01:10.149> pushes<00:01:11.149> on<00:01:11.469> tie<00:01:12.469> rod<00:01:12.709> end

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
force on the wheel pushes on tie rod end

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.389 
force on the wheel pushes on tie rod end
you<00:01:13.880> should<00:01:14.090> go<00:01:14.209> straight<00:01:14.270> into<00:01:14.719> the<00:01:14.899> rod<00:01:15.109> and

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:15.399 
you should go straight into the rod and

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:19.590 
you should go straight into the rod and
keep<00:01:16.399> it<00:01:16.579> mostly<00:01:16.819> symmetrical<00:01:18.159> well<00:01:19.159> with

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
keep it mostly symmetrical well with

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.309 
keep it mostly symmetrical well with
that<00:01:20.600> little<00:01:21.399> kitty<00:01:22.399> huapi<00:01:22.759> thing<00:01:22.969> there

00:01:23.309 --> 00:01:23.319 
that little kitty huapi thing there

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:27.489 
that little kitty huapi thing there
along<00:01:24.319> with<00:01:24.350> this<00:01:24.829> tilts<00:01:25.219> down<00:01:26.319> from<00:01:27.319> the

00:01:27.489 --> 00:01:27.499 
along with this tilts down from the

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:30.609 
along with this tilts down from the
access<00:01:28.369> that<00:01:29.359> goes<00:01:29.539> down<00:01:29.779> towards<00:01:30.229> the<00:01:30.289> curb

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
access that goes down towards the curb

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.730 
access that goes down towards the curb
so<00:01:31.579> whenever<00:01:31.789> these<00:01:32.539> tires<00:01:32.899> get<00:01:33.170> a<00:01:33.200> force<00:01:33.499> on

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
so whenever these tires get a force on

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.370 
so whenever these tires get a force on
them<00:01:33.889> say<00:01:34.729> the<00:01:34.880> tire<00:01:35.329> gets<00:01:35.569> bumped<00:01:35.869> towards

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
them say the tire gets bumped towards

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.679 
them say the tire gets bumped towards
the<00:01:36.439> center<00:01:36.740> of<00:01:36.829> the<00:01:36.920> truck<00:01:37.479> it's<00:01:38.479> going<00:01:38.630> to

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
the center of the truck it's going to

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:41.220 
the center of the truck it's going to
want<00:01:38.749> to<00:01:38.869> rotate<00:01:39.020> this<00:01:39.469> joint

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.230 
want to rotate this joint

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.380 
want to rotate this joint
kind<00:01:41.800> of<00:01:41.860> want<00:01:42.010> to<00:01:42.040> go<00:01:42.160> push<00:01:42.430> up<00:01:42.700> because<00:01:43.270> of

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
kind of want to go push up because of

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.680 
kind of want to go push up because of
the<00:01:43.480> arm<00:01:43.630> pushing<00:01:44.170> the<00:01:44.350> tie<00:01:44.500> rod<00:01:44.710> ends<00:01:44.920> on<00:01:45.690> here

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
the arm pushing the tie rod ends on here

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:47.960 
the arm pushing the tie rod ends on here
which<00:01:46.840> is<00:01:46.930> going<00:01:47.020> to<00:01:47.080> want<00:01:47.260> to<00:01:47.350> roll<00:01:47.530> that

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
which is going to want to roll that

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.270 
which is going to want to roll that
forward<00:01:48.970> which<00:01:49.510> is<00:01:49.540> going<00:01:49.780> to<00:01:49.840> put<00:01:50.280> sideways

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
forward which is going to put sideways

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
forward which is going to put sideways
stress<00:01:52.260> and<00:01:53.260> these<00:01:53.590> uh<00:01:53.790> these<00:01:54.790> joints<00:01:55.210> the

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
stress and these uh these joints the

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.190 
stress and these uh these joints the
Pitman<00:01:55.660> and<00:01:55.840> the<00:01:56.710> idler<00:01:57.479> so<00:01:58.479> this<00:01:58.690> is<00:01:58.840> the<00:01:58.930> play

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
Pitman and the idler so this is the play

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.110 
Pitman and the idler so this is the play
that<00:01:59.680> I<00:01:59.710> have<00:02:00.040> that<00:02:00.280> nobody<00:02:00.580> would<00:02:00.700> tell<00:02:00.910> me<00:02:01.060> if

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:01.120 
that I have that nobody would tell me if

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.040 
that I have that nobody would tell me if
it<00:02:01.240> was<00:02:01.330> normal

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:13.350 

see<00:02:05.050> that<00:02:09.600> you<00:02:10.600> don't<00:02:10.780> get<00:02:10.869> sideways<00:02:11.230> play<00:02:12.360> so

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
see that you don't get sideways play so

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.449 
see that you don't get sideways play so
that<00:02:13.510> seems<00:02:13.780> tight<00:02:14.080> and<00:02:14.350> the<00:02:14.830> mechanics<00:02:15.280> miss

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
that seems tight and the mechanics miss

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:21.530 
that seems tight and the mechanics miss
it<00:02:16.440> but<00:02:17.440> that<00:02:17.590> rotating<00:02:18.130> play<00:02:18.340> is<00:02:18.580> not<00:02:18.850> normal

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.180 

if<00:02:22.540> it's<00:02:22.720> really<00:02:22.989> showing<00:02:23.260> that<00:02:23.380> well<00:02:26.040> so<00:02:27.040> look

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
if it's really showing that well so look

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.949 
if it's really showing that well so look
how<00:02:27.340> much<00:02:27.489> room<00:02:27.850> or<00:02:28.420> how<00:02:28.540> much<00:02:28.720> that's

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
how much room or how much that's

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.430 
how much room or how much that's
wobbling<00:02:30.000> that<00:02:31.000> tie<00:02:31.239> rod<00:02:31.480> end<00:02:31.690> so<00:02:32.170> if<00:02:32.290> that's

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
wobbling that tie rod end so if that's

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.460 
wobbling that tie rod end so if that's
happening<00:02:32.860> on<00:02:32.980> both<00:02:33.190> ends<00:02:33.930> there<00:02:34.930> you<00:02:35.140> go<00:02:35.290> over

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
happening on both ends there you go over

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.290 
happening on both ends there you go over
a<00:02:35.500> bump

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
a bump

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.880 
a bump
let's<00:02:37.300> not<00:02:37.480> want<00:02:37.660> to<00:02:37.720> roll<00:02:37.870> this<00:02:38.110> so<00:02:38.770> you're

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
let's not want to roll this so you're

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.620 
let's not want to roll this so you're
going<00:02:39.040> to<00:02:39.100> be<00:02:39.160> bouncing<00:02:39.610> toe<00:02:39.820> in<00:02:40.000> toe<00:02:40.209> out<00:02:40.390> toe

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
going to be bouncing toe in toe out toe

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.130 
going to be bouncing toe in toe out toe
and<00:02:40.780> toe<00:02:40.959> out<00:02:41.110> not<00:02:42.100> that<00:02:42.310> drastic<00:02:42.790> but<00:02:43.140> you

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
and toe out not that drastic but you

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.610 
and toe out not that drastic but you
should<00:02:44.290> get<00:02:44.440> the<00:02:44.560> idea<00:02:44.920> now<00:02:46.080> even<00:02:47.080> with<00:02:47.410> all

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
should get the idea now even with all

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.560 
should get the idea now even with all
that<00:02:47.650> movement<00:02:48.310> you<00:02:48.459> wouldn't<00:02:49.239> think<00:02:49.420> it

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
that movement you wouldn't think it

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.820 
that movement you wouldn't think it
would<00:02:49.720> affect<00:02:50.640> wander<00:02:51.640> that<00:02:51.820> much<00:02:52.650> so<00:02:53.650> that's

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
would affect wander that much so that's

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.789 
would affect wander that much so that's
why<00:02:54.070> we're<00:02:54.280> replacing<00:02:54.519> this<00:02:54.910> crap<00:02:55.530> to<00:02:56.530> find

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
why we're replacing this crap to find

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:59.370 
why we're replacing this crap to find
out<00:02:57.030> because<00:02:58.030> I<00:02:58.390> don't<00:02:58.600> like<00:02:58.780> play<00:02:59.080> in<00:02:59.230> my

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
out because I don't like play in my

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.110 
out because I don't like play in my
steering<00:02:59.739> period

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.730 

there's<00:03:03.780> nothing<00:03:04.080> like<00:03:04.200> going<00:03:04.380> down<00:03:04.620> the

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
there's nothing like going down the

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:08.060 
there's nothing like going down the
freeway<00:03:05.120> turning<00:03:06.120> a<00:03:06.180> wheel<00:03:07.070> nothing's

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
freeway turning a wheel nothing's

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:24.170 
freeway turning a wheel nothing's
happening<00:03:22.280> moving<00:03:23.280> it<00:03:23.370> slowly<00:03:23.730> because<00:03:24.030> I

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
happening moving it slowly because I

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.640 
happening moving it slowly because I
think<00:03:24.240> the<00:03:24.450> refresh<00:03:24.840> rate<00:03:24.930> on<00:03:25.170> the<00:03:25.260> camera<00:03:25.590> is

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
think the refresh rate on the camera is

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:37.250 
think the refresh rate on the camera is
kind<00:03:25.800> of<00:03:25.950> slow<00:03:29.630> see<00:03:30.630> that<00:03:30.810> play<00:03:36.140> that's<00:03:37.140> how

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
kind of slow see that play that's how

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.699 
kind of slow see that play that's how
much<00:03:37.440> the<00:03:37.560> drag<00:03:37.770> link<00:03:38.010> is<00:03:38.160> moving<00:03:38.550> or<00:03:38.880> rolling

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
much the drag link is moving or rolling

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:45.920 
much the drag link is moving or rolling
in<00:03:40.709> front<00:03:41.010> to<00:03:41.100> back<00:03:42.260> and<00:03:43.260> watch<00:03:43.440> this<00:03:43.620> pair<00:03:44.930> ok

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
in front to back and watch this pair ok

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.979 
in front to back and watch this pair ok
good<00:03:46.170> angle<00:03:46.500> on<00:03:46.590> that<00:03:49.880> I<00:03:50.880> don't<00:03:51.870> you<00:03:51.959> can

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
good angle on that I don't you can

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.350 
good angle on that I don't you can
notice<00:03:52.380> but<00:03:52.560> when<00:03:52.709> I<00:03:52.739> roll<00:03:53.010> it<00:03:53.190> forward<00:03:53.760> the

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
notice but when I roll it forward the

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.770 
notice but when I roll it forward the
tire<00:03:54.600> pulls<00:03:54.900> in<00:03:55.080> I<00:03:55.350> have<00:03:56.310> pretty<00:03:56.459> good<00:03:56.580> him<00:03:56.760> up

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:07.940 

and<00:04:00.780> out<00:04:01.910> and<00:04:02.910> out<00:04:03.739> and<00:04:05.390> um<00:04:06.680> well<00:04:07.680> I<00:04:07.709> really

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
and out and out and um well I really

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.900 
and out and out and um well I really
didn't<00:04:08.130> need<00:04:08.220> a<00:04:08.280> tripod<00:04:09.860> so<00:04:10.860> that<00:04:11.610> kind<00:04:11.850> of

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
didn't need a tripod so that kind of

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.050 
didn't need a tripod so that kind of
movement<00:04:12.090> times<00:04:12.780> 2<00:04:12.989> I<00:04:13.610> think<00:04:14.610> would<00:04:14.850> account

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
movement times 2 I think would account

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.420 
movement times 2 I think would account
for<00:04:15.209> a<00:04:15.390> lot<00:04:15.630> of<00:04:15.750> sloppiness

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
for a lot of sloppiness

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.340 
for a lot of sloppiness
so<00:04:18.239> I'm<00:04:19.130> going<00:04:20.130> to<00:04:20.220> remove<00:04:20.989> the<00:04:21.989> big<00:04:22.169> white

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
so I'm going to remove the big white

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.670 
so I'm going to remove the big white
doohickey<00:04:22.880> and<00:04:23.960> get<00:04:24.960> rid<00:04:25.080> of<00:04:25.139> it<00:04:25.229> or<00:04:25.560> at<00:04:25.650> least

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
doohickey and get rid of it or at least

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.300 
doohickey and get rid of it or at least
put<00:04:25.919> on<00:04:25.979> the<00:04:26.160> shelf<00:04:26.810> until<00:04:27.810> I<00:04:28.530> must<00:04:28.979> neaten

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
put on the shelf until I must neaten

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.740 
put on the shelf until I must neaten
again<00:04:30.289> it's<00:04:31.289> the<00:04:31.380> thing<00:04:31.560> that<00:04:31.590> also<00:04:32.009> comes<00:04:32.190> up

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
again it's the thing that also comes up

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.330 
again it's the thing that also comes up
no<00:04:33.750> room<00:04:33.960> for<00:04:34.259> the<00:04:34.320> puller<00:04:34.530> on<00:04:34.830> the<00:04:35.009> Pitman

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
no room for the puller on the Pitman

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.719 
no room for the puller on the Pitman
shaft<00:04:35.550> this<00:04:35.759> is<00:04:35.940> what<00:04:36.060> everybody<00:04:36.389> talks<00:04:36.630> about

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:37.729 
shaft this is what everybody talks about

00:04:37.729 --> 00:04:40.460 
shaft this is what everybody talks about
not<00:04:38.729> having<00:04:39.120> my<00:04:39.240> shroud<00:04:39.509> off<00:04:39.750> in<00:04:39.960> a<00:04:40.020> long<00:04:40.229> long

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
not having my shroud off in a long long

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.370 
not having my shroud off in a long long
time<00:04:40.530> I<00:04:41.210> didn't<00:04:42.210> realize<00:04:42.360> how<00:04:42.720> tight<00:04:42.990> that<00:04:43.169> was

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
time I didn't realize how tight that was

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:48.350 
time I didn't realize how tight that was
under<00:04:43.650> there<00:04:43.800> I<00:04:44.449> had<00:04:45.449> hoped<00:04:45.720> to<00:04:47.000> flip<00:04:48.000> the<00:04:48.150> bolt

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
under there I had hoped to flip the bolt

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.180 
under there I had hoped to flip the bolt
around<00:04:48.720> and<00:04:50.780> sort<00:04:51.780> of<00:04:51.870> use<00:04:52.080> the<00:04:52.350> puller<00:04:52.949> in<00:04:53.130> a

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
around and sort of use the puller in a

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.610 
around and sort of use the puller in a
reverse<00:04:53.460> fashion<00:04:53.820> with<00:04:54.720> the<00:04:54.750> nut<00:04:55.020> pushing<00:04:55.470> on

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
reverse fashion with the nut pushing on

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.529 
reverse fashion with the nut pushing on

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:04.850 
box under something but the Bulge is too
long<00:05:03.570> and<00:05:03.930> there's<00:05:04.139> just<00:05:04.350> not<00:05:04.470> enough<00:05:04.530> room

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
long and there's just not enough room

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.400 
long and there's just not enough room
save<00:05:05.250> a<00:05:05.280> feeling<00:05:05.870> find<00:05:06.870> a<00:05:06.900> cloak<00:05:07.139> with<00:05:07.289> any

save a feeling find a cloak with any
really<00:05:07.650> good<00:05:07.800> ideas<00:05:08.250> I<00:05:08.570> am<00:05:09.570> going<00:05:09.990> to<00:05:10.260> remove

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:10.919 
really good ideas I am going to remove

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:13.010 
really good ideas I am going to remove
all<00:05:11.550> the<00:05:11.789> bolts<00:05:12.090> on<00:05:12.389> the<00:05:12.510> steering<00:05:12.780> gear

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
all the bolts on the steering gear

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.820 
all the bolts on the steering gear
except<00:05:13.410> for<00:05:13.590> the<00:05:13.650> one<00:05:13.820> right<00:05:14.820> there<00:05:15.030> in<00:05:15.150> front

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
except for the one right there in front

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.670 
except for the one right there in front
I'm<00:05:16.830> going<00:05:16.949> to<00:05:17.039> use<00:05:17.190> that<00:05:17.340> as<00:05:17.460> my<00:05:17.610> pivot<00:05:17.880> point

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
I'm going to use that as my pivot point

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.170 
I'm going to use that as my pivot point
and<00:05:19.680> wrap<00:05:19.919> that<00:05:20.130> sucker<00:05:20.430> back<00:05:20.729> just<00:05:21.030> a<00:05:21.150> little

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
and wrap that sucker back just a little

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.290 
and wrap that sucker back just a little
bit<00:05:22.010> to<00:05:23.010> clear<00:05:23.280> that<00:05:23.430> little<00:05:23.729> triangular

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
bit to clear that little triangular

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.939 
bit to clear that little triangular
brace<00:05:24.599> and<00:05:25.639> that<00:05:26.639> should<00:05:26.849> give<00:05:27.000> me<00:05:27.030> the<00:05:27.150> room

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:27.949 
brace and that should give me the room

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:30.379 
brace and that should give me the room
or<00:05:28.949> I<00:05:28.979> might<00:05:29.280> just<00:05:29.460> take<00:05:29.550> a<00:05:29.610> pump<00:05:29.849> right<00:05:30.030> now

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:30.389 
or I might just take a pump right now

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:34.250 
or I might just take a pump right now
pipe<00:05:30.900> rates<00:05:31.139> to<00:05:31.320> that<00:05:31.470> nut<00:05:32.039> there<00:05:33.110> let's<00:05:34.110> see

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:34.260 
pipe rates to that nut there let's see

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:37.399 
pipe rates to that nut there let's see
if<00:05:34.380> I<00:05:34.440> can<00:05:35.300> persuade<00:05:36.300> it<00:05:36.419> off<00:05:36.570> I<00:05:36.870> really<00:05:37.260> don't

want<00:05:37.560> to<00:05:37.620> beat<00:05:37.800> it<00:05:37.830> because<00:05:38.190> I<00:05:38.310> don't<00:05:38.490> want<00:05:38.639> to

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:38.729 
want to beat it because I don't want to

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:40.830 
want to beat it because I don't want to
damage<00:05:38.909> the<00:05:39.090> steering<00:05:39.510> gear

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.780 
I don't want to take this sucker off
just<00:05:43.900> like<00:05:44.110> plumbing<00:05:44.530> something<00:05:45.520> else<00:05:45.669> is

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:45.790 
just like plumbing something else is

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:47.430 
just like plumbing something else is
going<00:05:45.910> to<00:05:45.970> break<00:05:46.180> and<00:05:46.720> then<00:05:46.990> I<00:05:47.080> can't<00:05:47.320> go

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
going to break and then I can't go

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.100 
going to break and then I can't go
nowhere<00:05:47.610> to<00:05:48.610> get<00:05:48.730> it

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.450 

I<00:05:51.200> said<00:05:51.980> I'm<00:05:52.070> replacing<00:05:52.370> the<00:05:52.760> the<00:05:53.750> idler<00:05:54.080> arm

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:54.460

I said I'm replacing the the idler arm
bracket<00:05:55.460> also<00:05:56.860> so<00:05:57.860> that's<00:05:57.920> going<00:05:58.160> to<00:05:58.220> be<00:05:58.280> the

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.370 
bracket also so that's going to be the

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.610 
bracket also so that's going to be the
big<00:05:58.550> thing<00:05:58.580> up<00:05:58.970> there<00:05:59.180> going<00:06:00.020> down<00:06:00.260> to<00:06:00.380> there

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:00.620 
big thing up there going down to there

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.180 
big thing up there going down to there
and<00:06:01.550> then<00:06:01.700> going<00:06:01.910> over<00:06:02.270> to<00:06:02.450> the<00:06:02.570> drag<00:06:02.810> link

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:03.190 
and then going over to the drag link

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.000 
and then going over to the drag link
that's<00:06:04.190> all<00:06:04.340> getting<00:06:04.700> new<00:06:05.650> that<00:06:06.650> way<00:06:06.800> I<00:06:06.830> don't

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.010 
that's all getting new that way I don't

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:09.310 
that's all getting new that way I don't
have<00:06:07.280> to<00:06:07.400> mess<00:06:07.550> with<00:06:07.580> that<00:06:07.910> nut<00:06:08.150> and<00:06:08.390> another

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:09.320

have to mess with that nut and another
crappy<00:06:09.590> place<00:06:10.630> so<00:06:11.830> put<00:06:12.830> those<00:06:12.950> parts<00:06:13.220> together

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:24.320 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:33.480 

ah<00:06:24.670> got<00:06:25.670> the<00:06:26.440> bushings<00:06:27.880> the<00:06:28.880> rear<00:06:29.060> sway<00:06:29.360> bar

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:33.490 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:37.540 

look<00:06:34.490> like<00:06:34.640> that<00:06:34.790> they<00:06:35.300> not<00:06:35.480> as<00:06:35.660> hard<00:06:36.490> as<00:06:37.490> a

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:37.550 
look like that they not as hard as a

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:39.340 
look like that they not as hard as a
poly<00:06:37.970> but<00:06:38.270> I<00:06:38.330> could<00:06:38.510> be<00:06:38.630> wrong<00:06:38.660> they<00:06:39.020> sure<00:06:39.170> look

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:39.350 
poly but I could be wrong they sure look

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:41.890 
poly but I could be wrong they sure look
like<00:06:39.380> a<00:06:39.500> poly<00:06:40.120> to<00:06:41.120> have<00:06:41.240> a<00:06:41.270> little<00:06:41.480> gift<00:06:41.600> to<00:06:41.810> him

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.860 
like a poly to have a little gift to him
so<00:06:42.770> it's<00:06:42.920> either<00:06:43.010> a<00:06:43.130> weak<00:06:43.340> poly<00:06:43.640> or<00:06:44.540> a<00:06:44.570> poly

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:44.870 
so it's either a weak poly or a poly

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:47.500 
so it's either a weak poly or a poly
