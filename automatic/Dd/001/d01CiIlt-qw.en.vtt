00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.180
 begins this make up as a queen of 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.020
 nevi by applying a primer on the eyelid 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.430
 upper and also under the eye 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.410
 then being a silver pencil in the 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.120
 eye crease that I am going to blend with 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.690
 a small sector brush from 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.690
 shade 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:08.920
 then I take a matt gray 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.020
 dark that I go to stretch over the 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.190
 pencil previously applied with a 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.190
 precision brush 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.400
 keep adding product until 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.890
 I didn't get the color gradation 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:24.590
 desired blending everything very well 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.370
 every time to get a nuance 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.370
 gradual 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:39.660
 I then apply a little gray 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.660
 lighter above the dark dirige 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.700
 with a pan shimmer eye shadow I go to 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.270
 create my light spot under the arch 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.270
 eyebrow 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.560
 the smoke later a green water in the 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.759
 innermost part to create this 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.759
 a bit glacial effect 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.440
 I'm going to hang out in the central part 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.300
 of the eye of the silver glitter that 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.180
 then I will go to cover with a 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.130
 white watt eyeshadow 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:22.900
 This is because I want to create a texture 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.900
 similar to that of snowflakes 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.080
 resuming the dark gray matt of 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.670
 first I go to redefine the fold 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.890
 of the eye to create even more 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.070
 contrast between gray and color 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.070
 White 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.719
 to complete the upper part 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:02.730
 of the eye I finally apply a water 

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:06.090
 white as eyeliner starting as 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.400
 as usual from the middle and doing 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.849
 a very long line and is over towards 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.849
 the outside 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:17.599
 I add a bit of gray but also below 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:22.769
 the white line to give more 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:25.129
 three-dimensionality then passes to the part 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.129
 lower 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.150
 I apply a cream-colored pencil in the 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.680
 inside rhyme and I'm going to hang out in the 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.780
 outermost part of the lower line 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.340
 the mato gray used 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:39.030
 previously and in the most part 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:41.669
 inside the turquoise then created a point 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.609
 light in the inner corner of the eye e 

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:46.439
 I'm going to finally draw these lines to 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:49.260
 below the eye they could 

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:53.389
 remember the eyelashes of one eyelashes 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.389
 snow fairy of course 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.319
 I add a little turquoise on the white 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.480
 in the inner part of the eye 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:11.090
 finally I go to sit the same white man 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.160
 both on the lower lashes and on the 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.560
 eyebrows then going to comb 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.299
 to define them better 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.459
 in fact I want to create an effect of 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:22.120
 eyelashes clearer but not completely 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.120
 white 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.940
 then spread a veil of mascara on the 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:31.880
 upper eyelashes black mascara and I go to 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:36.380
 apply these false eyelashes a lot 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:38.230
 very long and scenic it applies 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:42.310
 a tuft also in the lower part 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:45.290
 so eye makeup is complete 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.960
 let's move on to the face 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:51.620
 I make a touring with an eye shadow 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:53.330
 blue that being under the cheekbone e 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.450
 light with a more Turkish eye shadow 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.850
 then on the high cheekbone I spread the diamonds 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:01.960
 in snow powder make up on the whole 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:05.870
 cheek to create this effect of 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:08.000
 ice diamonds and unfortunately the 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:10.130
 lip makeup I failed to 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.460
 film it anyway just know that I have 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:15.260
 applied a black and hot pencil 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:19.240
 staked the same bright turquoise 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.240
 first in the middle of the lips 

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.970
 I hope this trick a little more 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.710

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:29.470
