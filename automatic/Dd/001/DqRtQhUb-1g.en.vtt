 Hi, I am Tobias TrÃ¶ndle, I am a Wella Professionals guest artist 

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:08.943
 and I'm here with Stefanie. 

00:00:10.364 --> 00:00:13.902
 We show you today how you can create a messy bun. 

00:00:14.102 --> 00:00:15.161
 [THE LOOK] And the best thing is that 

00:00:15.241 --> 00:00:18.121
 it is so simple that you can do it yourself at home. 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.834
 MESSY KNOT 

00:00:30.107 --> 00:00:32.175
 Apply EMEI Dry Me dry shampoo to dry hair. 

00:00:32.255 --> 00:00:37.432
 This makes the hair matte, so that it is easier to light up. 

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:45.963
 Pass your fingers through the hair at the hair roots 

00:00:46.043 --> 00:00:48.037
 to ensure that the product is distributed evenly. 

00:00:49.375 --> 00:00:54.062
 Divide the hair into three zones. 

00:00:56.669 --> 00:01:01.737
 Grab the back part and gently top it up with your fingers. 

00:01:03.587 --> 00:01:12.100
 Turn a knot in it and pin in place. 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:20.406
 Pull it a little to get a messier effect. 

00:01:22.797 --> 00:01:31.675
 Grab a side part, top it up and turn the lock slightly. 

00:01:34.318 --> 00:01:38.029
 Turn the lock around the bun and secure with pins. 

00:01:40.812 --> 00:01:45.527
 Let go of a few hairs. 

00:01:48.003 --> 00:01:55.531
 Do the same on the other side. 

00:02:04.128 --> 00:02:07.729
 Finish it with your fingers and EIMI Stay Styled hair spray. 

00:02:12.285 --> 00:02:14.187
 TRY AND SHARE 

00:02:24.481 --> 00:02:25.585
