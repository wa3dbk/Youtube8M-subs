00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.180 

okay<00:00:00.599> here's<00:00:00.840> our<00:00:00.960> lockdown<00:00:01.469> defender<00:00:01.860> bands

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
okay here's our lockdown defender bands

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.789 
okay here's our lockdown defender bands
and<00:00:02.659> these<00:00:03.659> are<00:00:03.870> the<00:00:03.959> same<00:00:04.170> price<00:00:04.529> as<00:00:04.770> the

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
and these are the same price as the

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:06.920 
and these are the same price as the
skills<00:00:05.160> lateral<00:00:05.640> resistor<00:00:06.210> they're<00:00:06.629> every

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
skills lateral resistor they're every

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.320 
skills lateral resistor they're every
bit<00:00:06.960> as<00:00:07.200> comfortable<00:00:07.710> fit<00:00:07.950> the<00:00:08.010> same<00:00:08.280> way<00:00:08.550> but

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
bit as comfortable fit the same way but

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.509 
bit as comfortable fit the same way but
the<00:00:09.450> key<00:00:09.719> difference<00:00:10.170> is<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.559> bands<00:00:11.099> are<00:00:11.340> much

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
the key difference is the bands are much

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.160 
the key difference is the bands are much
shorter<00:00:11.849> so<00:00:12.240> you're<00:00:12.690> going<00:00:12.929> to<00:00:12.990> get

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
shorter so you're going to get

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.440 
shorter so you're going to get
resistance<00:00:13.590> right<00:00:14.040> from<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.340> start<00:00:14.639> another

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
resistance right from the start another

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:23.560 
resistance right from the start another
important<00:00:16.109> point<00:00:16.379> is<00:00:16.710> that<00:00:17.580> these<00:00:18.029> come<00:00:18.300> out

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.179 

so<00:00:24.570> I<00:00:24.600> can<00:00:24.930> take<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:25.140> band<00:00:25.410> out<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:25.949> put<00:00:26.160> a

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
so I can take a band out and put a

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.220 
so I can take a band out and put a
different<00:00:26.369> one<00:00:26.609> in<00:00:26.939> so<00:00:27.570> now<00:00:27.689> I<00:00:27.720> can<00:00:27.990> customize

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
different one in so now I can customize

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.650 
different one in so now I can customize
my<00:00:28.590> resistance<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.699> we<00:00:30.150> sell<00:00:30.390> three

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
my resistance and we sell three

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.510 
my resistance and we sell three
different<00:00:31.050> packages<00:00:31.260> of<00:00:31.800> resistance<00:00:32.340> from

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
different packages of resistance from

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.810 
different packages of resistance from
youth<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.969> pro<00:00:33.770> so<00:00:34.770> I'll<00:00:34.860> pop<00:00:35.070> that<00:00:35.100> back<00:00:35.489> in

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
youth to pro so I'll pop that back in

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.830 
youth to pro so I'll pop that back in
and<00:00:36.090> I<00:00:36.899> can<00:00:37.079> take<00:00:37.230> these<00:00:37.410> in<00:00:37.649> or<00:00:37.770> out<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.660> I<00:00:39.660> can

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
and I can take these in or out and I can

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.720 
and I can take these in or out and I can
always<00:00:40.020> be<00:00:40.320> increasing<00:00:40.860> my<00:00:40.980> resistance<00:00:41.340> by<00:00:41.610> up

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
always be increasing my resistance by up

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.030 
always be increasing my resistance by up
to<00:00:41.820> ten<00:00:42.030> pounds<00:00:42.450> now<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.899> standard<00:00:43.350> lockdown

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
to ten pounds now the standard lockdown

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.060 
to ten pounds now the standard lockdown
defender<00:00:44.460> band<00:00:44.730> comes<00:00:45.390> with<00:00:45.629> three<00:00:46.200> forty

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
defender band comes with three forty

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.180 
defender band comes with three forty
pound<00:00:47.399> magenta<00:00:48.210> bands<00:00:48.719> so<00:00:49.590> if<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:49.770> have<00:00:49.920> one

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
pound magenta bands so if you have one

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.889 
pound magenta bands so if you have one
band<00:00:50.430> in<00:00:50.700> that's<00:00:51.090> forty<00:00:51.480> pounds<00:00:51.809> of

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
band in that's forty pounds of

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.779 
band in that's forty pounds of
resistance<00:00:52.020> if<00:00:52.860> you<00:00:52.949> have<00:00:53.129> two<00:00:53.340> pounds<00:00:53.579> in

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
resistance if you have two pounds in

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.299 
resistance if you have two pounds in
that's<00:00:54.030> eighty<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.719> have<00:00:54.930> three<00:00:55.230> that's<00:00:55.500> 120

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
that's eighty you have three that's 120

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.400 
that's eighty you have three that's 120
and<00:00:56.640> if<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.270> buy<00:00:57.449> get<00:00:57.930> into<00:00:58.079> our<00:00:58.199> youth

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
and if you buy get into our youth

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.220 
and if you buy get into our youth
packages<00:00:59.039> during<00:00:59.489> your<00:00:59.579> high<00:00:59.699> college<00:01:00.230> you

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
packages during your high college you

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.380 
packages during your high college you
can<00:01:01.440> get<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.739> right<00:01:01.920> resistance<00:01:02.609> for<00:01:03.210> your

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
can get the right resistance for your

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.630 
can get the right resistance for your
age<00:01:03.570> level<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.680> you'll<00:01:05.159> always<00:01:05.369> have

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
age level and you'll always have

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.370 
age level and you'll always have
resistance<00:01:06.210> from<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.420> start<00:01:06.689> because<00:01:06.930> these

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
resistance from the start because these

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.700 
resistance from the start because these
are<00:01:07.740> much<00:01:08.100> shorter<00:01:08.460> bands<00:01:09.229> okay<00:01:10.229> here<00:01:10.560> we<00:01:10.680> have

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
are much shorter bands okay here we have

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.340 
are much shorter bands okay here we have
Cameron<00:01:11.340> again<00:01:11.670> Cameron's<00:01:12.240> 13<00:01:12.689> about<00:01:13.020> five

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
Cameron again Cameron's 13 about five

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.999 
Cameron again Cameron's 13 about five
one<00:01:13.590> five<00:01:13.799> two<00:01:14.070> as<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.820> can<00:01:15.000> see<00:01:15.799> when<00:01:16.799> he's

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
one five two as you can see when he's

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.399 
one five two as you can see when he's
just<00:01:17.549> shoulder-width<00:01:18.090> apart<00:01:18.229> these<00:01:19.229> are

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
just shoulder-width apart these are

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.310 
just shoulder-width apart these are
already<00:01:19.710> they're<00:01:20.310> not<00:01:20.490> sagging<00:01:21.140> and<00:01:22.140> not

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
already they're not sagging and not

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.410 
already they're not sagging and not
resisting<00:01:22.920> him<00:01:23.070> yet<00:01:23.280> but<00:01:23.939> so<00:01:24.119> go<00:01:24.210> ahead<00:01:24.270> and

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
resisting him yet but so go ahead and

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.210 
resisting him yet but so go ahead and
step<00:01:24.540> out<00:01:24.750> just<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.409> little<00:01:25.470> bit<00:01:25.650> not<00:01:25.860> that<00:01:26.100> far

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
step out just a little bit not that far

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.340 
step out just a little bit not that far
just<00:01:26.400> shoulder-width<00:01:26.850> apart<00:01:27.080> okay<00:01:28.080> so<00:01:28.140> now

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
just shoulder-width apart okay so now

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.050 
just shoulder-width apart okay so now
he's<00:01:28.500> a<00:01:28.530> shoulder-width<00:01:29.070> apart<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.030> can

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
he's a shoulder-width apart and you can

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.960 
he's a shoulder-width apart and you can
see<00:01:30.329> these<00:01:30.479> bands<00:01:30.750> are<00:01:30.990> already<00:01:31.259> tight<00:01:31.970> okay

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
see these bands are already tight okay

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.160 
see these bands are already tight okay
so<00:01:33.030> he's<00:01:33.299> starting<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.659> get<00:01:33.840> resistance

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
so he's starting to get resistance

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.050 
so he's starting to get resistance
already<00:01:34.770> okay<00:01:35.490> now<00:01:35.640> go<00:01:35.759> ahead<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:35.909> take

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
already okay now go ahead and take

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.999 
already okay now go ahead and take
another<00:01:36.180> step<00:01:36.479> out<00:01:36.659> Cameron<00:01:37.049> so<00:01:37.590> as<00:01:37.710> he<00:01:37.829> goes

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
another step out Cameron so as he goes

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.100 
another step out Cameron so as he goes
we've<00:01:38.729> got<00:01:38.759> 80<00:01:38.970> pounds<00:01:39.329> on<00:01:39.420> there<00:01:39.630> for<00:01:39.840> him<00:01:39.960> you

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
we've got 80 pounds on there for him you

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.340 
we've got 80 pounds on there for him you
can<00:01:40.439> see<00:01:40.619> these<00:01:40.829> are<00:01:41.070> stretched<00:01:42.079> quite<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.110> bit

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
can see these are stretched quite a bit

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.719 
can see these are stretched quite a bit
now<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:43.860> he's<00:01:44.040> getting<00:01:44.189> some<00:01:44.430> really<00:01:44.610> good

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
now so he's getting some really good

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.050 
now so he's getting some really good
resistance<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.659> again<00:01:46.380> with<00:01:47.130> these<00:01:47.310> we<00:01:47.820> have

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
resistance and again with these we have

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.230 
resistance and again with these we have
a<00:01:48.090> 50<00:01:48.600> pound<00:01:48.780> orange<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.770> we<00:01:49.950> have<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.220> 30<00:01:50.970> pound

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
a 50 pound orange and we have a 30 pound

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.480 
a 50 pound orange and we have a 30 pound
pink<00:01:51.689> in<00:01:51.869> there<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:52.500> he's<00:01:52.649> got<00:01:52.829> 80<00:01:53.009> pounds<00:01:53.430> of

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
pink in there so he's got 80 pounds of

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.880 
pink in there so he's got 80 pounds of
resistance<00:01:53.640> and<00:01:54.270> we<00:01:54.869> can<00:01:55.020> customize<00:01:55.530> this
