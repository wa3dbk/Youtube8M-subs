00:00:02.459 --> 00:00:07.660
 all people angry that almost sick and 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.310
 welcome to this new gadget euro 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.320
 I am going to explain how to draw 

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:14.230
 convert to vector file 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.750
 to the mediator and I explain how to do this 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.699
 can use it in a fun way 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.190
 I now show what we are going to make this is 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:23.560
 a poster I made I think 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:27.699
 it really does look very much so bring it 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:30.609
 have to start quickly in step 1 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:32.470
 make a drawing and scan the drawing 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.220
 so you have a soundcheck what your pocket is about 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.730
 can move 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:39.070
 vector file and then doe is twitter 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.930
 my drawing you have to watch that you 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.690
 do not have to make very thin lines 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.640
 of pencil between because then goes to the 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.620
 don't see rue des Food and isn't going pretty 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.170
 are now ensures that the thick 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.809
 lines or a padding that the 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.510
 is called drawing padding and thank the geus 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.730
 chance of compressed air and yes if the web 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.390
 use and go scan and have that 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.230
 done 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.230
 can precisely against it 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:06.459
 sometimes drawing parties convert to 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.810
 effector wit so joe harper use 

00:01:06.459 --> 00:01:09.850
 in the poster 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:14.219
 I have a file here because I feel it 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:18.249
 scanner got that sleepin all usv too 

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:20.439
 if he is advancing or a small colleague 

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:22.149
 Thinking much more often is a job through 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:23.740
 file 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:26.200
 It can also be large or small market he 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:31.539
 I have to 5 because everything is factor in everything 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:34.139
 eat and select image do you have or 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:37.149
 clearly did not want to cover but 

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:39.789
 would go back on it and then my 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:43.959
 drawings that you press on and then goes 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:46.509
 in it and now wins black is want 

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:48.840
 is unhealthy there vector file once 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:51.099
 not that it is a really nice effect 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.349
 you really see another you're annoying 

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:55.239
 and I really like that 

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:57.249
 You can still see that piece of jacket here 

00:01:55.239 --> 00:01:58.899
 remove the disc again 

00:01:57.249 --> 00:02:01.479
 if everything is right there can expand 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:03.840
 and it all makes a point 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.840
 of it 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.160
 now it's all group working 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.040
 between roads 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:14.630
 apple ipad are right mouse and tv 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:16.400
 pears and look I remove this 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.550
 have more than this and then we can 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.550
 three 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.780
 without is really shaping the 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.810
 poster so now can with this brush 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.600
 because we want to do is first 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.480
 just as much as the food in the middle of the sign 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.550
 area that with this here 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.560
 and usually applicable to mashie selection 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.430
 he can push you out at the time 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.400
 area 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:43.340
 always nice this is the drawing area 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:47.360
 and it wants to align to that 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.430
 so then press against and on this one 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.980
 and then it is exactly in the middle 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.600
 I have something for the sake of convenience 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.430
 of stomach salt you can see which below 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.270
 consumed in the poster there image 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.000
 image and the 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:04.940
 letti mug also in the slimes real what the 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.010
 scarf with a twist can 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.959
 first we will determine the director 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.709
 is orange going or which 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:15.440
 and now you can hold the ones with one 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.630
 pipette and then press ok and then go 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:21.830
 you use the abyss that I have here 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:24.799
 now come put that for us 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.730
 I still have 27 percent fat as a cow under 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:27.769
 move 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.780
 no it will be too dominating so me 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:32.570
 put 27% 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:36.080
 so and then can go to the text 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:38.269
 I have for this text and start 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:42.769
 other chabi chic 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:45.170
 and using our text let our lab located 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:51.280
 but that your table tag does 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:53.110
 often something fruit knows like that 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.079
 for the bottom tags I have it 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.909
 chosen to pay attention to all letters 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:01.390
 but it is for the evil technique 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:04.510
 there is too tight skin with this 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:06.310
 and then we glue it found ladder 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.739
 sjonnie and 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.970
 and that's more Slightly more water will 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:11.970
 just so beautiful 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:24.310
 don't know middle with this expand 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:27.130
 this so and then you still need this text 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:30.130
 make neas author platform 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:32.789
 she woke up and that's that type 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.789
 montserrat 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.960
 because it is almost shit so close now 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.889
 ready where you see another one here 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:48.340
 small effect your cento this text was there 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:51.910
 I did that with this layer this one 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:56.860
 also put in the description 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:05:00.099
 you drag him over the brush so one became 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:02.320
 this layer and men now brush your cap 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:05.710
 fine if you need to go to fancy 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:07.870
 pet finder is very busy here 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.780
 secondly, he ensures that the 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:12.820
 top layer actually from the 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:19.510
 underlying layer 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:22.120
 so the panel that just loading and then see 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:23.729
 you that all that pieces out 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.180
 has snips 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:31.639
 I think it's beautiful now with this one 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:35.279
 text make sure that the text 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:37.589
 make it tapping and all paths are 

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:39.569
 mouth over text spain nothing with fun 

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:45.120
 band of your 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:48.870
 the sun through this trip and was so low now 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.699
 will roll why and give duo with 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:54.419
 all from lines perfectly with this 

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:56.729
 Reasons LED tapping make us brief 

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:59.249
 this one 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:02.460
 So consider checking and then you can really 

00:05:59.249 --> 00:06:03.449
 try acting everything and then 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.689
 right mouse button 

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:09.509
 happen just check to make sure 

00:06:06.689 --> 00:06:13.110
 and still saw what that piece is shifting 

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:14.969
 12 count and yes I am pretty fast 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:16.319
 I think it's really beautiful I hope you 

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:17.819
 not like about you maybe you can 

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:19.979
 really in the section or leave you 

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:22.229
 of find and or between example of 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:24.419
 we can also learn from you how 

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:25.529
 soul to china makes kondo Impact 

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:27.659
 in your stitches 

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:29.430
 then click in your top right and have video 

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:31.860
 and he really gets it all out 

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:33.330
 oliviers goes for other yes and for 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:35.009
 this video is just as sure with
