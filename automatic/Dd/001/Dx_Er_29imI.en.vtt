00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.929
 we just did almost 

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:10.510
 Butter as they say in England but 

00:00:07.929 --> 00:00:15.330
 with many super originals because 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:18.460
 We did a lot of faith of foundations and 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.530
 pepper and ginger facilitators 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.810
 a total delight but it's not that they come 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:26.140
 the infusions and we will extract 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:29.020
 streets of Cervantes and Cervantes 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.940
 do and also because I left it for a 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.680
 second step because I know you the 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.870
 trout you need the last ones with a 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.789
 technique that I tell you quickly for 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.069
 What is the use of partridges? 

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:41.440
 beat 200 grams of butter ointment 

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:42.729
 slogan with black sugar shakes well 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.920
 well well well well is growing a 

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:47.050
 cream and there we see the flavor that 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.139
 we had until black ground pepper 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.059
 offensive and demolished or cool or a little 

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:52.839
 of instant coffee / with a little bit of 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:55.420
 Water 

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:58.239
 that was the technique today we add 240 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.100
 grams and I was by this famous we are 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.350
 different 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.140
 I can not put it straight to the cookie 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:08.600
 yerba mate is weird I'm going to find 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.600
 with the bits so they put me 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.090
 well you can not imagine a 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.229
 cookie in which to bite and there are sticks 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.860
 of grass 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.530
 it's not good, so then we did 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.930
 to infuse with that instead of both 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.509
 being grams of butter taken with salt 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:33.360
 100 grams of butter test and we are going to 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.700
 hydrate what infuse 100 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.250
 centimeters points of milk cream that 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.040
 he evokes them 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:46.330
 let's have a cream with 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:48.670
 observe in divisions this must be the 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:53.610
 recipe for missions but even though it's 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.610
 the little sheet of music you gave 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.110
 heat 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.530
 for 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.060
 before 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.720
 to everything very well 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.660
 good minutes 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.130
 he was getting joanito look how crazy the 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.910
 I think 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.910
 of the incredible 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.870
 I listened to music very well 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.870
 live 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:34.140
 The idea is to beat 100 grams of Nancy 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:37.329
 is formed by some olives approving 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.800
 aware of cubic meters of cream and 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:44.900
 works of conserves matter 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:48.010
 I was killing you, Cava is finished 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.010
 the truth 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:53.920
 but still wants 100 grams 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.560
 is what is beating out there and for 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.799
 we do the same in envelopes and 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.799
 this 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:07.500
 and the code of d 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.500
 in this great 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:14.170
 properly he did as he says he does 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:16.950
 without functioning also like English 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.950
 for you 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.910
 in darjeeling myself as well as john 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.340
 I was being the one who found me 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.760
 canned with butter chemicals and 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.760
 100 grams 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.110
 because that 's what the 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.530
 jobs we put them to work the 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.530
 true 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:46.180
 with 10 cubic centimeters of cream the 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.180
 aesthetic 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:57.240
 to the two preparations with 240 grams 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:59.580
 of flour 4 projects of development simbad 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:02.660
 and other goods of integrals again what 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.660
 same on this side 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:15.190
 while little steps and now is the time 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:16.900
 to change is the work of change I move away 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.720
 of a space while the boys 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:23.040
 work I'm going to show you how they were 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.040
 these birds and have come out of the oven 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.900
 look at the legitimate ones of the block 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:31.900
 previous 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.220
 half but if cold misfortunes 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:43.630
 before but during knowing what is the one 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.630
 is falling 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.130
 to see if it's the noise 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:57.210
 and well they are but tantita are roganti 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.700
 You are flavored with castellÃ³ I have 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.650
 well then with this only without 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:04.230
 integrated the same we did 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:06.350
 we take a little ball now we are going to 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.350
 give 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:12.509
 you can fly if we are doing we are 

00:05:10.739 --> 00:05:13.660
 making cookies with flavors 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:15.880
 original 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.890
 in this case to be vain 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.410
 and infused is milk cream 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:22.930
 preserved view of programs and from 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:25.830
 ok but we pressed on the hand 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:30.270
 by the number of clients 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:34.470
 and now the pretty skirts crush 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:39.600
 originals of the band la plata 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:39.600
 to do this 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:47.230
 but we put it here 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:54.249
 but that could not be what could send 

00:05:52.179 --> 00:05:57.099
 to the cold and then cook in the oven 

00:05:54.249 --> 00:05:59.969
 so that they keep the form better and 

00:05:57.099 --> 00:05:59.969
 have life 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:10.680
 usually in the hour 100 points 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:13.229
 because I left the habit are 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:15.630
 tastes that we have incorporated for now 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:20.900
 combined 

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:20.900
 in it you have to renew the lord
