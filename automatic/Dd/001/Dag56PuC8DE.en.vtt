what<00:00:00.539> you<00:00:00.690> see<00:00:00.900> is<00:00:01.170> a<00:00:01.469> wheel<00:00:01.680> with<00:00:02.070> an

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
what you see is a wheel with an

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.789 
what you see is a wheel with an
integrated<00:00:02.760> electrical<00:00:03.419> engine<00:00:03.810> and<00:00:04.290> this

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
integrated electrical engine and this

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.130 
integrated electrical engine and this
has<00:00:05.009> this<00:00:05.430> thing<00:00:05.730> is<00:00:05.910> around<00:00:06.330> already<00:00:06.660> because

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
has this thing is around already because

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.919 
has this thing is around already because
it's<00:00:07.319> in<00:00:07.500> the<00:00:08.490> principles<00:00:09.090> courses<00:00:09.599> in<00:00:09.750> many

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
it's in the principles courses in many

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.290 
it's in the principles courses in many
electrical<00:00:10.620> bikes<00:00:10.920> and<00:00:11.280> electrical<00:00:11.820> scooters

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
electrical bikes and electrical scooters

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.829 
electrical bikes and electrical scooters
but<00:00:13.230> this<00:00:13.440> one<00:00:13.620> is<00:00:13.769> made<00:00:13.980> for<00:00:14.389> almost<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.540> bus

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
but this one is made for almost the bus

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.109 
but this one is made for almost the bus
type<00:00:16.230> load<00:00:16.529> and<00:00:16.830> there's<00:00:17.160> many<00:00:17.400> other<00:00:17.609> designs

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
type load and there's many other designs

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.029 
type load and there's many other designs
there's<00:00:18.359> a<00:00:18.449> Dutch<00:00:18.630> design<00:00:19.050> that<00:00:19.740> is<00:00:19.859> also

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
there's a Dutch design that is also

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.480 
there's a Dutch design that is also
capable<00:00:21.000> of<00:00:21.449> carrying<00:00:21.750> a<00:00:22.080> bus<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.560> then<00:00:23.250> you

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
capable of carrying a bus and then you

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.089 
capable of carrying a bus and then you
basically<00:00:23.760> have<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.180> drive<00:00:24.800> the<00:00:25.800> drive

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
basically have to drive the drive

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.900 
basically have to drive the drive
mechanism<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.660> vehicle<00:00:28.080> in<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:28.470> wheel

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
mechanism of the vehicle in the wheel

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.700 
mechanism of the vehicle in the wheel
which<00:00:29.910> is<00:00:30.060> also<00:00:30.240> favorable<00:00:31.170> because<00:00:31.439> then<00:00:31.619> you

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
which is also favorable because then you

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.280 
which is also favorable because then you
have<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.890> lot<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.040> weight<00:00:32.279> in<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.579> wheel<00:00:32.759> and

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 
have a lot of weight in the wheel and

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.720 
have a lot of weight in the wheel and
well<00:00:34.290> if<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.530> brake<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.010> suspension<00:00:35.100> in<00:00:35.579> this

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
well if a brake and suspension in this

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.220 
well if a brake and suspension in this
one<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.149> you<00:00:36.210> can<00:00:36.239> even<00:00:36.510> use<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:36.840> for<00:00:36.989> steering

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
one and you can even use it for steering

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.400 
one and you can even use it for steering
so<00:00:37.890> this<00:00:38.070> one<00:00:38.250> you'd<00:00:38.460> basically<00:00:39.050> connect<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.379> a

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
so this one you'd basically connect to a

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.720 
so this one you'd basically connect to a
frame<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.070> then<00:00:41.160> you're<00:00:41.280> done

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
frame and then you're done

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.540 
frame and then you're done
but<00:00:42.719> are<00:00:42.840> many<00:00:43.020> examples<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.190> think<00:00:44.219> this

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
but are many examples and I think this

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.040 
but are many examples and I think this
is<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.820> way<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.030> get<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.660> electric

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
is the way to get to the electric

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.619 
is the way to get to the electric
vehicle<00:00:46.469> much<00:00:46.710> quicker<00:00:47.039> then<00:00:47.789> then<00:00:48.210> that's<00:00:48.420> a

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
vehicle much quicker then then that's a

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.810 
vehicle much quicker then then that's a
weight<00:00:48.840> for<00:00:49.079> car<00:00:49.920> manufacturers<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.670> develop

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
weight for car manufacturers to develop

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.439

and<00:00:57.780> it's<00:00:58.079> far<00:00:58.350> much<00:00:58.559> smarter<00:00:59.070> for<00:00:59.850> for<00:01:00.570> small

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
that is there around the brake disk and

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.620 
that is there around the brake disk and
I<00:01:13.740> think<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.490> know<00:01:14.729> I'll<00:01:15.030> just<00:01:15.330> put<00:01:15.540> an

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
I think you know I'll just put an

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.330 
I think you know I'll just put an
electrical<00:01:16.020> engine<00:01:16.320> in<00:01:16.439> there<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:17.220> I'll

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
electrical engine in there and I'll

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.330 
electrical engine in there and I'll
design<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.970> wheel<00:01:18.240> I'll<00:01:19.080> design<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.500> wheel<00:01:19.799> like

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
design a wheel I'll design a wheel like

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.020 
design a wheel I'll design a wheel like
just<00:01:20.549> like<00:01:20.700> this<00:01:20.880> one<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.680> and<00:01:22.680> I'll<00:01:22.860> just<00:01:23.130> put

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
just like this one and and I'll just put

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.460 
just like this one and and I'll just put
some<00:01:24.060> magnets<00:01:24.479> on<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.659> outside<00:01:25.049> so<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.290> have

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
some magnets on the outside so you have

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.649 
some magnets on the outside so you have
a<00:01:25.560> brushless<00:01:25.799> engine<00:01:26.280> put<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.150> spools<00:01:27.390> on<00:01:27.570> the

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
a brushless engine put the spools on the

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.890 
a brushless engine put the spools on the
inside<00:01:28.400> some<00:01:29.400> braking<00:01:29.820> etcetera<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.780> I'll

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
inside some braking etcetera and I'll

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.920 
inside some braking etcetera and I'll
make<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:32.220> really<00:01:32.460> can<00:01:33.210> attach<00:01:33.600> to

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
make it so that it really can attach to

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.910 
make it so that it really can attach to
a<00:01:34.140> normal<00:01:34.619> will<00:01:35.520> help<00:01:35.909> or<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.180> new<00:01:36.930> normal<00:01:37.530> axle

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
a normal will help or a new normal axle

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.120 
a normal will help or a new normal axle
that's<00:01:38.700> completely<00:01:39.119> possible<00:01:39.860> and<00:01:40.860> what<00:01:41.040> you

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
that's completely possible and what you

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.920 
that's completely possible and what you
get<00:01:41.310> then<00:01:41.460> is<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.729> you<00:01:41.880> get<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.060> car<00:01:42.329> with<00:01:42.720> all

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
get then is that you get a car with all

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.399 
get then is that you get a car with all
the<00:01:43.229> pull<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.740> essentials<00:01:44.159> in<00:01:44.250> there<00:01:45.409> an

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
the pull the essentials in there an

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.050 
the pull the essentials in there an
engine<00:01:46.770> combustion<00:01:47.399> engine<00:01:47.820> there's<00:01:47.970> no

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
engine combustion engine there's no

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.460 
engine combustion engine there's no
longer<00:01:48.299> need<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.479> so<00:01:48.689> you<00:01:48.780> can<00:01:48.960> take<00:01:49.259> it<00:01:49.320> out

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
longer need it so you can take it out

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.920 
longer need it so you can take it out
you<00:01:49.649> replace<00:01:50.009> it<00:01:50.040> with<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.340> battery<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:50.970> or<00:01:51.810> an

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
you replace it with a battery and or an

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.870 
you replace it with a battery and or an
ultracapacitor<00:01:52.409> if<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:53.009> want<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.340> charge

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
ultracapacitor if you want to charge

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
as soon as you have the wheel and of

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.119 
as soon as you have the wheel and of
course

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:09.129 
course

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:10.830 
course
the<00:02:09.340> wheels<00:02:09.670> lost<00:02:09.849> jeepers<00:02:10.329> and<00:02:10.359> everybody

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
the wheels lost jeepers and everybody

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.140 
the wheels lost jeepers and everybody
can<00:02:11.019> convert<00:02:11.349> their<00:02:11.530> cars<00:02:11.739> into<00:02:11.890> electric<00:02:12.400> and

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
can convert their cars into electric and

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.849 
can convert their cars into electric and
you<00:02:13.239> just<00:02:13.420> make<00:02:13.629> it<00:02:13.749> an<00:02:14.139> electric<00:02:14.499> car<00:02:14.620> engines

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:14.859 
you just make it an electric car engines

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:16.349 
you just make it an electric car engines
are<00:02:14.950> not<00:02:15.069> expensive<00:02:15.430> so<00:02:15.790> you<00:02:15.819> make<00:02:16.090> the<00:02:16.209> wheel

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:16.359 
are not expensive so you make the wheel

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:18.289 
are not expensive so you make the wheel
in<00:02:16.629> such<00:02:16.840> a<00:02:16.870> way<00:02:17.079> that<00:02:17.109> the<00:02:17.499> savings<00:02:17.859> are

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
in such a way that the savings are

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.539 
in such a way that the savings are
offset<00:02:19.379> or<00:02:20.379> the<00:02:20.590> cost<00:02:20.769> offset<00:02:21.159> the<00:02:21.249> safe<00:02:21.430> you

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:21.549 
offset or the cost offset the safe you

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:22.709 
offset or the cost offset the safe you
see<00:02:21.670> you<00:02:21.760> have<00:02:21.909> a<00:02:21.939> few<00:02:22.209> because<00:02:22.450> you're<00:02:22.629> not

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:22.719 
see you have a few because you're not

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:25.110 
see you have a few because you're not
driving<00:02:23.109> electric<00:02:23.730> that's<00:02:24.730> the<00:02:24.849> way<00:02:24.939> I<00:02:24.969> think

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
driving electric that's the way I think

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.910 
driving electric that's the way I think
you<00:02:25.450> should<00:02:25.750> go<00:02:25.959> and<00:02:26.200> that's<00:02:26.349> the<00:02:26.469> way<00:02:26.590> if<00:02:26.799> you

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
you should go and that's the way if you

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.830 
you should go and that's the way if you
are<00:02:26.950> a<00:02:27.069> small<00:02:27.370> entrepreneur<00:02:27.639> or<00:02:28.269> workshop<00:02:28.689> in

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
are a small entrepreneur or workshop in

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.300 
are a small entrepreneur or workshop in
the<00:02:28.959> US<00:02:29.200> or<00:02:29.409> around<00:02:29.769> the<00:02:29.920> world<00:02:29.950> you<00:02:30.189> should

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
the US or around the world you should

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.720 
the US or around the world you should
think<00:02:30.549> about<00:02:30.730> this<00:02:30.969> I<00:02:31.090> think<00:02:31.120> ok<00:02:31.569> can<00:02:32.530> can<00:02:33.400> I<00:02:33.489> in

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
think about this I think ok can can I in

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.539 
think about this I think ok can can I in
my<00:02:33.879> country<00:02:34.120> make<00:02:34.480> something<00:02:34.840> like<00:02:34.989> this<00:02:35.549> even

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
my country make something like this even

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.280 
my country make something like this even
this<00:02:37.209> model<00:02:37.540> that<00:02:37.659> you're<00:02:37.750> looking<00:02:38.019> at<00:02:38.139> to

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
this model that you're looking at to

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.069 
this model that you're looking at to
sense<00:02:38.530> an<00:02:39.069> engine<00:02:39.400> here<00:02:39.639> with<00:02:40.359> of<00:02:40.540> course<00:02:40.810> some

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079 
sense an engine here with of course some

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:44.270 
sense an engine here with of course some
sub<00:02:41.889> my<00:02:42.069> gears<00:02:42.400> to<00:02:42.909> tie<00:02:43.239> it<00:02:43.299> to<00:02:43.599> the<00:02:43.719> outside

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
sub my gears to tie it to the outside

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.009 
sub my gears to tie it to the outside
and<00:02:45.280> these<00:02:45.609> edges<00:02:46.060> are<00:02:46.209> not<00:02:46.329> expensive<00:02:46.719> they

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:47.019 
and these edges are not expensive they

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:48.929 
and these edges are not expensive they
are<00:02:47.079> very<00:02:47.260> cheap<00:02:47.319> actually<00:02:47.709> you<00:02:48.609> get<00:02:48.819> them

00:02:48.929 --> 00:02:48.939 
are very cheap actually you get them

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:50.879 
are very cheap actually you get them
everywhere<00:02:49.299> so<00:02:49.599> you<00:02:50.139> just<00:02:50.409> put<00:02:50.560> them<00:02:50.680> in<00:02:50.799> the

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:50.889 
everywhere so you just put them in the

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:53.129 
everywhere so you just put them in the
wheel<00:02:51.040> in<00:02:51.340> the<00:02:51.549> frame<00:02:52.180> and<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.719> way<00:02:52.840> that<00:02:53.019> you

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:53.139 
wheel in the frame and the way that you

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:54.899 
wheel in the frame and the way that you
think<00:02:53.260> about<00:02:53.439> it<00:02:53.709> so<00:02:54.189> basically<00:02:54.340> to<00:02:54.669> looking

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:54.909 
think about it so basically to looking

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:58.979 
think about it so basically to looking
at<00:02:55.000> here<00:02:55.180> is<00:02:55.299> is<00:02:55.650> a<00:02:56.760> suspension<00:02:57.760> system<00:02:57.989> with

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
at here is is a suspension system with

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.030 
at here is is a suspension system with
integrated<00:02:59.560> engines<00:02:59.919> and<00:03:00.129> then<00:03:00.459> the<00:03:00.579> wheel

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
integrated engines and then the wheel

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.890 
integrated engines and then the wheel
you<00:03:03.040> do<00:03:03.189> this<00:03:03.370> you're<00:03:03.609> being<00:03:04.180> ingenious

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
you do this you're being ingenious

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.089 
you do this you're being ingenious
you're<00:03:05.109> being<00:03:05.290> an<00:03:05.439> entrepreneur<00:03:05.980> you're

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
you're being an entrepreneur you're

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:07.979 
you're being an entrepreneur you're
being<00:03:06.340> somebody<00:03:07.000> that<00:03:07.209> makes<00:03:07.389> something<00:03:07.659> new

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
being somebody that makes something new

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:13.379 
being somebody that makes something new
and<00:03:08.439> that<00:03:09.269> takes<00:03:10.269> a<00:03:10.389> shortcut<00:03:10.930> to<00:03:12.030> to<00:03:13.030> a<00:03:13.060> goal

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:13.389 
and that takes a shortcut to to a goal

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:14.939 
and that takes a shortcut to to a goal
that<00:03:13.419> otherwise<00:03:14.019> is<00:03:14.259> controlled<00:03:14.680> by<00:03:14.769> the

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:14.949 
that otherwise is controlled by the

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:17.339 
that otherwise is controlled by the
industry<00:03:15.459> and<00:03:15.729> has<00:03:15.879> been<00:03:16.060> postponed<00:03:16.900> for<00:03:17.139> many

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:17.349 
industry and has been postponed for many

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:19.349 
industry and has been postponed for many
many<00:03:17.560> years<00:03:17.650> while<00:03:18.009> the<00:03:18.189> industry<00:03:18.519> knew<00:03:18.669> that

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:19.359 
many years while the industry knew that

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:23.129 
many years while the industry knew that
cars<00:03:19.659> were<00:03:20.909> attributed<00:03:21.909> to<00:03:21.939> to<00:03:22.870> carbon

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:23.139 
cars were attributed to to carbon

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:26.039 
cars were attributed to to carbon
emissions<00:03:23.500> and<00:03:24.389> eventually<00:03:25.389> to<00:03:25.599> global

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
emissions and eventually to global

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:27.929 
emissions and eventually to global
warming<00:03:26.349> and<00:03:26.439> it<00:03:26.530> was<00:03:26.709> all<00:03:26.919> the<00:03:27.129> mistake<00:03:27.729> of

00:03:27.929 --> 00:03:27.939 
warming and it was all the mistake of

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:31.140 
warming and it was all the mistake of
having<00:03:28.769> combustion<00:03:29.769> engines<00:03:30.129> they<00:03:30.759> knew<00:03:30.939> that

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
having combustion engines they knew that

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.589 
having combustion engines they knew that
and<00:03:31.359> they<00:03:31.419> just<00:03:32.669> you<00:03:33.669> know<00:03:33.729> slow<00:03:34.180> down<00:03:34.209> the

00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:34.599 
and they just you know slow down the

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:36.809 
and they just you know slow down the
whole<00:03:34.689> process<00:03:34.750> and<00:03:35.439> cost<00:03:35.769> and<00:03:36.099> they

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
whole process and cost and they

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.479 
whole process and cost and they
destroyed<00:03:37.239> these<00:03:38.019> electrical<00:03:38.500> cars<00:03:38.739> when

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
destroyed these electrical cars when

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.360 
destroyed these electrical cars when
they<00:03:39.579> were<00:03:39.699> first<00:03:39.909> developed<00:03:41.069> all<00:03:42.069> that

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
they were first developed all that

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.420 
they were first developed all that
research<00:03:42.549> was<00:03:43.419> suppressed<00:03:44.229> and<00:03:44.500> now<00:03:45.040> we're<00:03:45.250> in

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
research was suppressed and now we're in

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.740 
research was suppressed and now we're in
the<00:03:45.609> deep<00:03:45.759> trouble<00:03:46.150> that<00:03:46.269> were<00:03:46.419> in<00:03:46.540> with

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
the deep trouble that were in with

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.339 
the deep trouble that were in with
global<00:03:47.109> warming<00:03:47.790> so<00:03:48.790> and<00:03:49.389> and<00:03:49.629> there's<00:03:50.259> a

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
global warming so and and there's a

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:52.439 
global warming so and and there's a
recession<00:03:50.829> and<00:03:51.159> some<00:03:51.790> people<00:03:52.090> have<00:03:52.180> to<00:03:52.329> see

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:52.449 
recession and some people have to see

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:54.390 
recession and some people have to see
opportunities<00:03:53.409> and<00:03:53.560> take<00:03:53.739> them<00:03:53.889> well<00:03:54.159> I<00:03:54.280> think

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
opportunities and take them well I think

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.249 
opportunities and take them well I think
this<00:03:54.939> is<00:03:55.060> one<00:03:55.209> of<00:03:55.239> the<00:03:55.419> opportunities<00:03:55.599> because

00:03:56.249 --> 00:03:56.259 
this is one of the opportunities because

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:57.659 
this is one of the opportunities because
it's<00:03:56.379> not<00:03:56.530> hard<00:03:56.739> to<00:03:57.040> make<00:03:57.189> a<00:03:57.219> wheel<00:03:57.430> like<00:03:57.639> this

00:03:57.659 --> 00:03:57.669 
it's not hard to make a wheel like this

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:00.089 
it's not hard to make a wheel like this
and<00:03:57.849> if<00:03:58.659> you<00:03:58.689> are<00:03:58.870> in<00:03:58.989> a<00:03:59.079> country<00:03:59.259> where<00:03:59.650> where

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
and if you are in a country where where

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:02.399 
and if you are in a country where where
the<00:04:00.280> industries<00:04:00.729> are<00:04:00.759> not<00:04:01.030> that<00:04:01.239> the<00:04:01.989> laws<00:04:02.199> are

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:02.409 
the industries are not that the laws are

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:05.309 
the industries are not that the laws are
not<00:04:02.469> that<00:04:02.709> strict<00:04:02.919> yet<00:04:03.819> so<00:04:04.239> that's<00:04:05.079> not

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
not that strict yet so that's not

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:10.050 
not that strict yet so that's not

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
of an idea design it build it and then

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.950 
of an idea design it build it and then
try<00:04:25.460> it<00:04:25.520> and<00:04:25.820> if<00:04:26.449> you're<00:04:26.600> not<00:04:26.750> killing

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
try it and if you're not killing

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.500 
try it and if you're not killing
yourself<00:04:27.410> out<00:04:27.590> right<00:04:27.800> and<00:04:28.070> then<00:04:28.280> it's<00:04:28.460> fine<00:04:28.699> of

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:29.510 
yourself out right and then it's fine of

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.000 
yourself out right and then it's fine of
course<00:04:29.660> you<00:04:29.870> can<00:04:29.990> go<00:04:30.080> to<00:04:30.139> some<00:04:30.500> testing<00:04:30.889> of

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
course you can go to some testing of

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:32.520 
course you can go to some testing of
course<00:04:31.160> these<00:04:31.340> wheels<00:04:31.639> also<00:04:31.850> being<00:04:32.120> tested

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
course these wheels also being tested

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.050 
course these wheels also being tested
and<00:04:33.530> do<00:04:33.740> it<00:04:33.889> you<00:04:34.220> know<00:04:34.310> just<00:04:34.669> make<00:04:34.850> these

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
and do it you know just make these

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.750 
and do it you know just make these
things<00:04:35.440> that's<00:04:36.440> the<00:04:36.590> way<00:04:36.740> and<00:04:37.070> you<00:04:37.160> can<00:04:37.340> sell

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
things that's the way and you can sell

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.520 
things that's the way and you can sell
the<00:04:37.910> engine<00:04:38.210> metal<00:04:38.780> and<00:04:38.990> whatever<00:04:39.139> it's<00:04:39.410> in

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
the engine metal and whatever it's in

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.189 
the engine metal and whatever it's in
there<00:04:39.740> for<00:04:40.130> and<00:04:41.060> that<00:04:41.270> can<00:04:41.449> also<00:04:41.600> offset<00:04:42.110> the

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:42.199 
there for and that can also offset the

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:45.760 
there for and that can also offset the
cost<00:04:42.410> of<00:04:42.560> the<00:04:42.620> wheels<00:04:43.180> so<00:04:44.180> I<00:04:44.210> hope<00:04:44.750> I<00:04:45.320> hope<00:04:45.530> this

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
cost of the wheels so I hope I hope this

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.580 
cost of the wheels so I hope I hope this
becomes<00:04:45.979> a<00:04:46.310> trend<00:04:46.550> and<00:04:46.850> a<00:04:47.330> way<00:04:47.479> to<00:04:47.539> to<00:04:48.260> break

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
becomes a trend and a way to to break

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.080 
becomes a trend and a way to to break
through<00:04:48.889> the<00:04:49.250> monopolies<00:04:49.669> of<00:04:49.850> the<00:04:49.940> car

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
through the monopolies of the car

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.000 
through the monopolies of the car
companies<00:04:50.510> because<00:04:50.840> making<00:04:51.470> wheels<00:04:51.800> with

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
companies because making wheels with

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.090 
companies because making wheels with
engines<00:04:52.340> is<00:04:52.520> not<00:04:52.729> that<00:04:52.910> difficult
