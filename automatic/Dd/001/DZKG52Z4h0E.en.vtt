00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.809
 or action hello friends today 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.910
 we will introduce a mechanism 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:17.350
 automatic opening and closing 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:21.970
 of a chicken door then the door is 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:24.850
 materialized by this piece of cardboard the 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.070
 mechanism itself is the following it is 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:30.370
 consists of an engine that turns a 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:33.250
 axis that drives belt with a 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:35.289
 reduction effect that turns 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.749
 this wheel which itself is united 

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:40.929
 of these taxes when the wheel turns 

00:00:37.749 --> 00:00:44.319
 Acce also turns the rope 

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:47.859
 roll lap of the aps he makes up the 

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:50.379
 door which then opens the care 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:53.789
 the system changes direction 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:56.379
 the rope unwinds and the door closes 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.170
 we have here a reduction system 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:02.469
 which allows us through 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:05.860
 this big wheel to handle a 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:08.710
 delay and a reversal of meaning 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.830
 as we will see during the 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:15.070
 demonstration at the demonstration 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:17.460
 it's eight o'clock in the morning the door 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:17.460
 opens 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.710
 we see here the door open the end 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.490
 of the group reaches adductors the door 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.840
 is open 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.740
 the hens are free there is eight 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:41.100
 evening hours 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:42.600
 if he passes the December laporte 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.290
 door and brags the door of the centers 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.150
 the end of the race reaches the switch 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:54.210
 laporte stops and she is ready to 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:59.240
 go back to a new cycle so if 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:04.250
 we make the system work so 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.250
 uninterrupted that's what we get 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:11.450
 a we have a door 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:21.810
 he goes down 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:26.640
 the end of lounger inside when I 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:29.980
 gas mens the door opens 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:33.840
 etc we now have to resist and 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.840
 remove the wiring diagram 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.910
 what the system is made of 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.220
 electric is the following we have 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.770
 two electrical circuits each of 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.110
 circuits being controlled by a 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.000
 delay 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.820
 we have a double switch was worth 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.070
 well as we have seen 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.900
 double switch not and stands to a 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:08.470
 dual function first function 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:11.410
 change the direction of the motor by changing 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.900
 power supply to capacitors change 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.900
 the direction of rotation of the engine so 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:19.740
 second function is to move from one 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.610
 electrical circuit to each other so 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.590
 when the end of the race was a 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.140
 switch we have to toggle 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.360
 from one electric circus to another is 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.190
 also a change of meaning as 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.400
 electrical circuits are not 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:36.040
 powered only at 8 am and 8 pm 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:39.340
 we will get to the movement 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:43.030
 alternate searched at 8 am and 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:45.489
 at 8 pm the evening then sees for 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.709
 realize this little montage of what have 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:50.950
 you need that you will need a 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.940
 from a breadmaking machine motor of a 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.650
 capacitor of 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:04:04.480
 the lgv is that of two computers 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:09.140
 of a switch here but also of 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:11.180
 a scooter wheel two 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:14.300
 gybes that come from a 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.920
 mower traction self - propelled 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:20.420
 switch back and forth that is 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:24.260
 the most expensive element of this montage or 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:26.540
 to I hope this has interested you where 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.950
 you will also need a big wheel 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.110
 that I leave you the care to realize 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.780
 a big wooden wheel and more she is 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.750
 great more of your timing will be 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:39.770
 high of course you can have 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:42.140
 several race for me at different 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.420
 places of mud depending on the 

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:46.400
 duration you want to get with a 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:49.370
 only end of course we have of course 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.500
 the maximum duration 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.170
 here I hope that this little editing you 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:58.450
 interested and see you soon 

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:58.450
 it remains clash it's good
