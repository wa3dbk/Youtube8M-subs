00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.120 
it in a random generator and we're gonna
get<00:02:59.300> 32<00:02:59.810> names<00:03:00.320> and<00:03:00.590> those<00:03:00.800> are<00:03:00.920> going<00:03:01.010> to<00:03:01.070> be

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
get 32 names and those are going to be

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.060 
get 32 names and those are going to be
the<00:03:01.250> people<00:03:01.370> in<00:03:01.670> the<00:03:01.790> tournament<00:03:02.210> but<00:03:02.300> that

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
the people in the tournament but that

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.020 
the people in the tournament but that
doesn't<00:03:04.070> mean<00:03:04.250> if<00:03:04.400> you<00:03:04.490> don't<00:03:04.700> get<00:03:04.850> in<00:03:05.000> that

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
doesn't mean if you don't get in that

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.190 
doesn't mean if you don't get in that
you<00:03:05.270> shouldn't<00:03:05.510> go<00:03:05.630> to<00:03:05.690> the<00:03:05.810> stream<00:03:06.050> because

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
you shouldn't go to the stream because

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.390 
you shouldn't go to the stream because
it<00:03:06.290> will<00:03:06.380> be<00:03:06.500> fun<00:03:06.680> and<00:03:06.860> it<00:03:06.920> doesn't<00:03:07.190> mean<00:03:07.310> you

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
it will be fun and it doesn't mean you

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.460 
it will be fun and it doesn't mean you
won't<00:03:07.580> get<00:03:07.700> in<00:03:07.850> it's<00:03:08.360> gonna<00:03:08.450> be<00:03:08.600> 32<00:03:08.960> people<00:03:09.200> and

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
won't get in it's gonna be 32 people and

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:10.810 
won't get in it's gonna be 32 people and
it's<00:03:09.560> gonna<00:03:09.680> be<00:03:09.830> a<00:03:09.860> live<00:03:10.070> stream<00:03:10.280> so<00:03:10.610> if

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
it's gonna be a live stream so if

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.910 
it's gonna be a live stream so if
someone<00:03:11.600> doesn't<00:03:11.900> show<00:03:12.020> up<00:03:12.200> in<00:03:12.590> the<00:03:12.770> beginning

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
someone doesn't show up in the beginning

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.200 
someone doesn't show up in the beginning
of<00:03:13.130> the<00:03:13.250> stream<00:03:13.430> we're<00:03:13.550> going<00:03:13.670> to<00:03:13.730> give<00:03:13.970> like<00:03:14.180> a

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.210 
of the stream we're going to give like a

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.720 
of the stream we're going to give like a
15<00:03:15.110> minute<00:03:15.290> to<00:03:15.470> 30<00:03:15.680> minute<00:03:15.950> grace<00:03:16.130> period<00:03:16.310> and

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
15 minute to 30 minute grace period and

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:17.800 
15 minute to 30 minute grace period and
then<00:03:16.820> we're<00:03:16.940> just<00:03:16.970> going<00:03:17.150> to<00:03:17.210> go<00:03:17.360> with<00:03:17.390> it<00:03:17.660> if

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
then we're just going to go with it if

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.150 
then we're just going to go with it if
you<00:03:18.200> don't<00:03:18.380> show<00:03:18.530> up<00:03:18.620> in<00:03:18.709> that<00:03:18.830> time<00:03:19.040> and

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
you don't show up in that time and

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.440 
you don't show up in that time and
you're<00:03:19.280> on<00:03:19.400> the<00:03:19.580> list<00:03:19.730> you<00:03:20.030> were<00:03:20.150> gonna<00:03:20.270> get

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
you're on the list you were gonna get

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.660 
you're on the list you were gonna get
kicked<00:03:20.690> out<00:03:20.900> I'm<00:03:21.500> sorry<00:03:21.860> we<00:03:22.220> can't<00:03:22.459> wait<00:03:22.640> all

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:22.670 
kicked out I'm sorry we can't wait all

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.070 
kicked out I'm sorry we can't wait all
day<00:03:22.820> for<00:03:23.000> one<00:03:23.240> person<00:03:23.600> and<00:03:23.780> we're<00:03:23.930> just<00:03:23.990> going

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.600 
day for one person and we're just going
to<00:03:24.200> replace<00:03:24.440> you<00:03:24.620> with<00:03:24.650> a<00:03:24.740> substitute<00:03:25.250> person

to replace you with a substitute person
so<00:03:25.790> we'll<00:03:26.300> make<00:03:26.420> a<00:03:26.450> substitute<00:03:26.990> list<00:03:27.200> and<00:03:27.700> you

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
so we'll make a substitute list and you

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:29.740 
so we'll make a substitute list and you
know<00:03:28.790> if<00:03:28.910> you're<00:03:29.000> on<00:03:29.120> the<00:03:29.150> substitute<00:03:29.540> list

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
know if you're on the substitute list

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.480 
know if you're on the substitute list

and you're there when we say we need a

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:33.130 
and you're there when we say we need a
substitute<00:03:32.090> you<00:03:32.420> can<00:03:32.540> get<00:03:32.690> right<00:03:32.840> into<00:03:32.990> the

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
substitute you can get right into the

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.540 
substitute you can get right into the
tournament<00:03:33.320> and<00:03:33.590> we're<00:03:34.100> going<00:03:34.220> to<00:03:34.280> go<00:03:34.400> it's
