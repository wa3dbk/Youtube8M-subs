00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
disease Denise Miller was low-fat raw

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.069 
disease Denise Miller was low-fat raw
vegan<00:00:36.930> for<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.199> year<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:38.569> she<00:00:39.569> had<00:00:39.839> health

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
vegan for a year and she had health

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.689 
vegan for a year and she had health
problems<00:00:40.469> because<00:00:41.399> of<00:00:41.429> this<00:00:41.789> and<00:00:43.309> the<00:00:44.309> main

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:44.699 
problems because of this and the main

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:46.849 
problems because of this and the main
reason<00:00:45.120> was<00:00:45.479> probably<00:00:45.989> because<00:00:46.319> she<00:00:46.499> wasn't

00:00:46.849 --> 00:00:46.859 
reason was probably because she wasn't

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:50.180 
reason was probably because she wasn't
eating<00:00:46.979> enough<00:00:47.190> calories<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:48.260> the<00:00:49.260> health

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
eating enough calories and the health

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.979 
eating enough calories and the health
problems<00:00:50.550> that<00:00:50.609> she<00:00:50.879> experienced<00:00:51.449> included

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
problems that she experienced included

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.619 
problems that she experienced included
losing<00:00:52.379> too<00:00:52.530> much<00:00:52.649> weight<00:00:53.089> hair<00:00:54.089> falling<00:00:54.510> out

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
losing too much weight hair falling out

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.029 
losing too much weight hair falling out
and<00:00:54.960> teeth<00:00:55.260> problems<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.100> these<00:00:57.089> are<00:00:57.329> all

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
and teeth problems and these are all

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:01.279 
and teeth problems and these are all
classic<00:00:59.039> signs<00:00:59.069> of<00:00:59.429> starvation<00:00:59.839> so<00:01:00.839> that<00:01:01.109> was

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
classic signs of starvation so that was

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.789 
classic signs of starvation so that was
a<00:01:01.319> likely<00:01:01.859> reason<00:01:02.069> that<00:01:02.719> 80/10/10<00:01:03.719> or<00:01:04.290> low-fat

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
a likely reason that 80/10/10 or low-fat

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.010 
a likely reason that 80/10/10 or low-fat
raw<00:01:05.250> vegan<00:01:05.610> didn't<00:01:06.030> work<00:01:06.180> out<00:01:06.390> for<00:01:06.659> her

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
raw vegan didn't work out for her

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.980 
raw vegan didn't work out for her
so<00:01:08.329> I<00:01:09.350> would<00:01:10.350> recommend<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:11.219> if<00:01:11.990> anyone

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
so I would recommend that if anyone

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.109 
so I would recommend that if anyone
can't<00:01:13.560> get<00:01:13.710> enough<00:01:13.979> calories<00:01:14.280> through<00:01:14.789> eating

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
can't get enough calories through eating

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.660 
can't get enough calories through eating
fruit<00:01:15.479> that<00:01:16.439> they<00:01:16.770> should<00:01:17.039> include<00:01:17.219> some

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
fruit that they should include some

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.910 
fruit that they should include some
cooked<00:01:17.969> food<00:01:18.030> including<00:01:18.780> cook<00:01:19.020> starches<00:01:19.560> or

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
cooked food including cook starches or

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.319 
cooked food including cook starches or
whole<00:01:20.759> grains<00:01:21.119> or<00:01:21.420> legumes<00:01:21.799> rather<00:01:22.799> than<00:01:23.329> just

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:24.329 
whole grains or legumes rather than just

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:26.899 
whole grains or legumes rather than just
trying<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.689> stay<00:01:24.899> raw<00:01:25.490> so<00:01:26.490> in<00:01:26.729> this

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
trying to stay raw so in this

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:27.940 
trying to stay raw so in this
presentation

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
presentation

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.469 
presentation
she<00:01:28.950> made<00:01:29.130> some<00:01:29.369> really<00:01:29.549> good<00:01:29.789> points<00:01:30.030> and

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
she made some really good points and

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.959 
she made some really good points and
I'll<00:01:31.049> just<00:01:31.380> summarize<00:01:31.590> those<00:01:32.070> points<00:01:32.520> in<00:01:32.789> this

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:32.969 
I'll just summarize those points in this

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:35.419 
I'll just summarize those points in this
video<00:01:33.299> but<00:01:34.229> I<00:01:34.259> do<00:01:34.439> recommend<00:01:34.890> checking<00:01:35.219> out

00:01:35.419 --> 00:01:35.429 
video but I do recommend checking out

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:37.760 
video but I do recommend checking out
the<00:01:35.490> whole<00:01:35.789> lecture<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.390> see<00:01:36.600> what<00:01:37.289> she<00:01:37.500> said

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
the whole lecture to see what she said

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.849 
the whole lecture to see what she said
one<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.969> important<00:01:39.450> studies<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:40.020> Denise

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:40.859 
one of the important studies that Denise

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:43.190 
one of the important studies that Denise
Miller<00:01:41.039> referred<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.909> in<00:01:42.210> her<00:01:42.509> presentation

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
Miller referred to in her presentation

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.440 
Miller referred to in her presentation
was<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.590> rice<00:01:43.770> diet<00:01:44.130> by<00:01:44.399> Walter<00:01:44.820> kempner<00:01:45.240> and

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
was the rice diet by Walter kempner and

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.590 
was the rice diet by Walter kempner and
she<00:01:46.320> outlined<00:01:46.859> what<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.490> diet<00:01:47.850> consisted<00:01:48.479> of

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
she outlined what the diet consisted of

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.039 
she outlined what the diet consisted of
which<00:01:49.469> was<00:01:49.829> quite<00:01:50.609> a<00:01:50.820> lot<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.270> rice<00:01:52.130> some<00:01:53.130> fruit

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
which was quite a lot of rice some fruit

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:56.989 
which was quite a lot of rice some fruit
unlimited<00:01:55.049> sugar<00:01:55.499> a<00:01:55.770> hundred<00:01:56.609> to<00:01:56.789> four

00:01:56.989 --> 00:01:56.999 
unlimited sugar a hundred to four

00:01:56.999 --> 00:02:00.050 
unlimited sugar a hundred to four
hundred<00:01:57.060> grams<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.840> day<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.520> unlimited<00:01:59.520> fruit

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
hundred grams a day and unlimited fruit

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.569 
hundred grams a day and unlimited fruit
juice<00:02:00.329> so<00:02:01.109> this<00:02:01.319> was<00:02:01.499> a<00:02:01.530> high<00:02:01.829> carb<00:02:02.189> low<00:02:02.549> fat

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
juice so this was a high carb low fat

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.230 
juice so this was a high carb low fat
diet<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:04.289> did<00:02:04.560> include<00:02:05.189> refined<00:02:05.759> sugar

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
diet and it did include refined sugar

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.100 
diet and it did include refined sugar
and<00:02:07.220> the<00:02:08.220> patients<00:02:08.970> were<00:02:09.210> definitely<00:02:09.690> not

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
and the patients were definitely not

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.210 
and the patients were definitely not
starving<00:02:10.590> because<00:02:10.800> they<00:02:11.400> had<00:02:11.960> 2,000<00:02:12.960> to<00:02:13.220> 2,400

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
starving because they had 2,000 to 2,400

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.790 
starving because they had 2,000 to 2,400
calories<00:02:14.730> a<00:02:15.000> day<00:02:15.090> it<00:02:16.080> probably<00:02:16.470> wasn't<00:02:16.620> the

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
calories a day it probably wasn't the

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.710 
calories a day it probably wasn't the
most<00:02:16.860> pleasant<00:02:17.250> diet<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:17.880> be<00:02:18.000> on

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
most pleasant diet to be on

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.110 
most pleasant diet to be on
but<00:02:19.250> kempner<00:02:20.250> was<00:02:20.400> pretty<00:02:20.640> strict<00:02:20.970> about

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
but kempner was pretty strict about

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.630 
but kempner was pretty strict about
keeping<00:02:21.330> his<00:02:21.990> patients<00:02:22.440> on<00:02:22.560> the<00:02:22.710> diet<00:02:22.950> and<00:02:23.250> as

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
keeping his patients on the diet and as

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.850 
keeping his patients on the diet and as
a<00:02:24.060> result<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.870> diabetics<00:02:25.410> could<00:02:25.620> go<00:02:25.770> off
