00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:09.590 
hey guys this is black ops ninja this

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.170 
hey guys this is black ops ninja this
would<00:00:09.740> be<00:00:09.830> my<00:00:09.950> first<00:00:09.980> tutorial<00:00:10.340> video<00:00:10.910> and

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:11.180 
would be my first tutorial video and

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:12.610 
would be my first tutorial video and
it's<00:00:11.299> going<00:00:11.450> to<00:00:11.510> be<00:00:11.600> on<00:00:11.750> how<00:00:12.350> to<00:00:12.410> make<00:00:12.590> a

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:12.620 
it's going to be on how to make a

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.000 
it's going to be on how to make a
ballistics<00:00:13.280> knife<00:00:13.490> out<00:00:13.790> of<00:00:14.000> a<00:00:14.180> marker<00:00:15.050> in<00:00:15.230> a

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:16.010 
ballistics knife out of a marker in a

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:18.880 
ballistics knife out of a marker in a
spring<00:00:16.340> this<00:00:17.330> mechanism<00:00:17.869> does<00:00:18.320> not<00:00:18.560> have<00:00:18.860> a

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:18.890 
spring this mechanism does not have a

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.370 
spring this mechanism does not have a
trigger<00:00:19.450> that's<00:00:20.450> how<00:00:20.599> I<00:00:20.630> like<00:00:20.900> it<00:00:20.960> you<00:00:21.230> can

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
trigger that's how I like it you can

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.500 
trigger that's how I like it you can
make<00:00:21.560> it<00:00:21.740> with<00:00:22.009> the<00:00:22.130> trigger<00:00:22.340> however<00:00:22.940> I<00:00:23.270> don't

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:23.510 
make it with the trigger however I don't

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:25.560 
make it with the trigger however I don't
care<00:00:23.660> but<00:00:24.440> you're<00:00:24.890> going<00:00:25.010> to<00:00:25.070> start<00:00:25.310> by

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:25.570 
care but you're going to start by

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.380 
care but you're going to start by
disassembling<00:00:26.570> the<00:00:27.260> marker<00:00:27.560> first<00:00:28.430> remove

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
disassembling the marker first remove

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.790 
disassembling the marker first remove
the<00:00:29.420> cap<00:00:29.720> and<00:00:30.189> then<00:00:31.189> the<00:00:32.150> back<00:00:32.390> stopper<00:00:33.230> you're

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
the cap and then the back stopper you're

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.439 
the cap and then the back stopper you're
going<00:00:33.920> to<00:00:33.980> want<00:00:34.100> to<00:00:34.190> remove<00:00:34.430> that<00:00:34.580> too<00:00:34.820> but

00:00:35.439 --> 00:00:35.449 
going to want to remove that too but

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:37.270 
going to want to remove that too but
it's<00:00:35.690> easiest<00:00:35.989> just<00:00:36.140> to<00:00:36.350> bite<00:00:36.650> it<00:00:36.830> and<00:00:36.860> pull<00:00:37.250> it

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
it's easiest just to bite it and pull it

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:44.799 
it's easiest just to bite it and pull it
off<00:00:41.170> and<00:00:42.170> it<00:00:42.350> comes<00:00:42.500> off<00:00:42.680> nice<00:00:43.010> for<00:00:43.610> Lisa<00:00:43.809> that

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
off and it comes off nice for Lisa that

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:47.380 
off and it comes off nice for Lisa that
thing<00:00:45.200> a<00:00:45.230> little<00:00:45.559> stopper<00:00:46.190> you<00:00:46.550> do<00:00:47.090> whatever

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
next you're going to want to remove the

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.229 
next you're going to want to remove the
cartridge<00:00:52.640> I<00:00:53.350> do<00:00:54.350> that<00:00:54.559> by<00:00:54.800> using<00:00:55.039> a<00:00:55.430> pin

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
cartridge I do that by using a pin

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.720 
cartridge I do that by using a pin
cartridge<00:00:56.690> and<00:00:56.870> just<00:00:57.190> jamming<00:00:58.190> it<00:00:58.309> in<00:00:58.489> there

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
cartridge and just jamming it in there

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.979 
cartridge and just jamming it in there
and<00:00:59.000> removing<00:00:59.870> it<00:01:00.940> comes<00:01:01.940> right<00:01:02.300> out<00:01:02.329> nice<00:01:02.960> and

the<00:01:06.560> tip<00:01:06.770> I<00:01:07.009> do<00:01:07.550> that<00:01:07.820> by<00:01:08.440> shoving<00:01:09.440> a<00:01:10.240> pin<00:01:11.240> tube

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
the tip I do that by shoving a pin tube

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.550 
the tip I do that by shoving a pin tube
down<00:01:12.140> there<00:01:12.409> giggidy<00:01:12.979> and<00:01:13.960> it<00:01:14.960> pops<00:01:15.170> out<00:01:15.380> like

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
down there giggidy and it pops out like

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.679 
down there giggidy and it pops out like
that<00:01:15.740> and<00:01:16.040> just<00:01:16.070> pinch<00:01:16.700> it<00:01:16.909> and<00:01:16.970> pull<00:01:17.420> it<00:01:17.450> right

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689 
that and just pinch it and pull it right

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:24.940 
that and just pinch it and pull it right
on<00:01:17.900> off<00:01:19.840> useful<00:01:20.840> are<00:01:22.299> now<00:01:23.299> that's<00:01:23.840> all<00:01:24.409> you

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
on off useful are now that's all you

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.620 
on off useful are now that's all you
need<00:01:25.100> for<00:01:25.280> the<00:01:25.400> shaft<00:01:25.700> of<00:01:25.970> your<00:01:26.180> ballistics

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
need for the shaft of your ballistics

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.630 
need for the shaft of your ballistics
knife<00:01:26.920> next<00:01:27.920> I<00:01:28.400> just<00:01:29.150> simply<00:01:30.310> put<00:01:31.310> the<00:01:31.460> cap

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
knife next I just simply put the cap

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.310 
knife next I just simply put the cap
back<00:01:31.670> on<00:01:32.000> there<00:01:32.210> so<00:01:32.390> your<00:01:32.570> fingers<00:01:33.110> okay

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
back on there so your fingers okay

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.230 
back on there so your fingers okay
thankee<00:01:34.600> next<00:01:35.600> is<00:01:35.780> to<00:01:36.350> put<00:01:36.829> the<00:01:36.950> spring<00:01:37.240> the

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
thankee next is to put the spring the

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.350 
thankee next is to put the spring the
bigger<00:01:38.420> the<00:01:38.630> spring<00:01:38.900> the<00:01:39.020> powerful<00:01:39.530> is

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
bigger the spring the powerful is

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.469 
bigger the spring the powerful is
powerful<00:01:41.360> word<00:01:41.540> and<00:01:42.729> doesn't<00:01:43.729> matter<00:01:44.119> as<00:01:44.420> long

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
powerful word and doesn't matter as long

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.840 
powerful word and doesn't matter as long
as<00:01:44.720> it<00:01:44.840> fits<00:01:44.990> in<00:01:45.290> the<00:01:45.530> tube<00:01:45.920> so<00:01:46.880> I<00:01:47.299> just<00:01:47.750> use<00:01:48.020> a

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
as it fits in the tube so I just use a

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.560 
as it fits in the tube so I just use a
fairly<00:01:49.850> long<00:01:50.000> spring<00:01:50.479> but<00:01:52.060> alright<00:01:53.060> just

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
fairly long spring but alright just

00:01:53.570 --> 00:02:02.570 
fairly long spring but alright just
shove<00:01:53.810> it<00:01:53.840> in<00:01:54.020> there<00:01:54.079> as<00:01:54.950> far<00:01:55.220> as<00:01:55.369> it'll<00:01:55.549> go<00:01:59.920> and

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
shove it in there as far as it'll go and

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.510 
shove it in there as far as it'll go and
you're<00:02:03.210> going<00:02:03.330> to<00:02:03.390> make<00:02:03.870> the<00:02:04.110> shaft<00:02:05.010> into<00:02:05.340> an

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
you're going to make the shaft into an

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.880 
you're going to make the shaft into an
oval<00:02:05.970> shape<00:02:06.030> because<00:02:06.570> that's<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.500> shape<00:02:07.680> of

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
oval shape because that's the shape of

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.210 
oval shape because that's the shape of
typically<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.820> bullets<00:02:09.149> i<00:02:09.270> use<00:02:09.830> alright<00:02:10.830> so

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
typically the bullets i use alright so

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.870 
typically the bullets i use alright so
there<00:02:11.430> we<00:02:11.610> go<00:02:11.640> that's<00:02:12.300> it<00:02:12.630> for<00:02:13.520> the<00:02:14.520> basic

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
there we go that's it for the basic

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.370 
there we go that's it for the basic
mechanism<00:02:15.600> of<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:17.250> ballistics<00:02:17.670> knife<00:02:18.380> next

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
mechanism of the ballistics knife next

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.580 
mechanism of the ballistics knife next
you're<00:02:20.040> going<00:02:20.130> to<00:02:20.190> want<00:02:20.250> to<00:02:20.400> make<00:02:20.520> a<00:02:20.760> bullet<00:02:21.030> I

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
you're going to want to make a bullet I

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.090 
you're going to want to make a bullet I
take<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:23.340> blade<00:02:23.690> just<00:02:24.690> a<00:02:24.930> only<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.680> blade<00:02:25.890> off

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
take the blade just a only the blade off

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.450 
take the blade just a only the blade off
of<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.490> pocket<00:02:26.880> knife<00:02:27.030> and<00:02:27.270> then<00:02:28.260> I<00:02:28.620> take<00:02:28.950> the

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
of the pocket knife and then I take the

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.440 
of the pocket knife and then I take the
cap<00:02:29.670> off<00:02:29.820> a<00:02:29.880> sharpie<00:02:30.450> and<00:02:30.920> I<00:02:31.920> just<00:02:32.210> jam<00:02:33.210> it<00:02:33.240> in

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
cap off a sharpie and I just jam it in

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.200 
cap off a sharpie and I just jam it in
there<00:02:33.660> and<00:02:34.370> you're<00:02:35.370> going<00:02:35.550> to<00:02:35.610> want<00:02:35.760> to<00:02:35.880> tape
