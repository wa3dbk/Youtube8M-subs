has quite a bit of shade this is
Thursday<00:00:45.640> September<00:00:47.290> 30th<00:00:48.290> I<00:00:48.470> guess<00:00:49.330> last<00:00:50.330> day

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
Thursday September 30th I guess last day

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:57.680 
Thursday September 30th I guess last day
of<00:00:50.600> the<00:00:50.780> month

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.310 

I<00:00:58.730> think<00:00:59.730> I<00:00:59.790> said<00:00:59.970> the<00:01:00.630> pathway<00:01:00.989> is<00:01:01.050> very

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
I think I said the pathway is very

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.200 
I think I said the pathway is very
shaded<00:01:03.949> there's<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:05.070> path<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.670> get<00:01:05.850> to<00:01:05.970> one<00:01:06.120> of

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
shaded there's a path to get to one of

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.719 
shaded there's a path to get to one of
the<00:01:06.270> other<00:01:06.420> buildings<00:01:09.860> well<00:01:10.860> here<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.580> can

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
the other buildings well here you can

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.020 
the other buildings well here you can
see<00:01:11.880> we're<00:01:12.030> coming<00:01:12.330> up<00:01:12.420> on<00:01:13.430> the<00:01:14.430> bridge<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.910> get

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
see we're coming up on the bridge to get

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.660 
see we're coming up on the bridge to get
to<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.240> pool<00:01:15.420> area<00:01:15.950> here's<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.040> path<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.520> get<00:01:17.640> to

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
to the pool area here's a path to get to

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.310 
to the pool area here's a path to get to
I<00:01:17.760> think<00:01:17.880> building<00:01:18.360> six<00:01:22.160> this<00:01:23.160> is<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.430> bridge

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
I think building six this is the bridge

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.719 
I think building six this is the bridge
to<00:01:25.320> get<00:01:25.470> out<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.800> pool<00:01:25.979> area<00:01:28.130> not<00:01:29.130> quite<00:01:29.520> as

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
to get out to the pool area not quite as

00:01:29.729 --> 00:02:01.370 
to get out to the pool area not quite as
shaded

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.750 

so<00:02:02.380> everything<00:02:02.740> here<00:02:02.980> is<00:02:03.130> a<00:02:03.160> little<00:02:03.460> bit<00:02:03.580> of<00:02:03.670> a

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
so everything here is a little bit of a

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.090 
so everything here is a little bit of a
walk<00:02:03.970> but<00:02:04.420> it's<00:02:04.600> actually<00:02:05.020> pretty<00:02:05.890> nice<00:02:08.100> you

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
walk but it's actually pretty nice you

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.390 
walk but it's actually pretty nice you
get<00:02:09.220> a<00:02:09.280> little<00:02:09.490> bit<00:02:09.550> of<00:02:09.670> exercise<00:02:10.150> for<00:02:10.510> your

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
get a little bit of exercise for your

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:24.640 
get a little bit of exercise for your
all-inclusive<00:02:12.400> meals<00:02:12.670> and<00:02:12.910> drinks

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.220 

I<00:02:25.000> pan<00:02:26.000> up<00:02:26.120> a<00:02:26.209> little<00:02:26.360> bit<00:02:26.569> is<00:02:26.689> September<00:02:27.200> 30th

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230
