 [Jose Maria Castillo] Hello, I am "JosÃ©, director of channels" Pocoyo ". 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:06.110
 Our theme today is how to reach the general public. 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.950
 [YouTube: Access to the general public] 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.150
 [How did the Pokoyo channels start?] We got over 2.6 billion views 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.250
 Since we started the first channel and it was called "Pocoyo TV". 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.130
 At "Pocoyo TV" we were showing content in English and Spanish. 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.480
 Now we have 10 different channels displaying their content 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.470
 English, Spanish and Italian 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.020
 Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Turkish. 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.710
 We continue to develop channels in different languages. 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.450
 We are currently developing the Russian channel. 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.700
 We develop the Indonesian channel. 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.650
 So we have an audience all over the world, 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.450
 We were told so much - 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.650
 We were introduced in English and Spanish because many use it 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.170
 This content is for the education of their English or Spanish children. 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.020
 The same is true for Chinese and Japanese. 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.780
 [Why did you establish several channels?] We made the decision to open the different channels 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.209
 According to the masses and numbers of people in different countries. 

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:09.050
 We covered the most people, 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.700
 Through English, Spanish, Chinese, 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.070
 To meet the tastes of most people in most countries of the world. 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.560
 Then we went to Turkey, a big country. 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.750
 Many Turks live outside Turkey, 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.300
 So we were very interested 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.660
 Meet the needs of people living outside their country. 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.590
 The same goes for many Spanish speakers. 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.490
 We are also developing Russian and Indonesian channels - 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.850
 Japanese as well as its beginning - 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.550
 Because we are sincerely interested in these families 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.700
 And all around when they watch "Pocoyo". 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.430
 Entertainment is not our only goal. 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.690
 Not only do we give them to them, we care about the educational aspect. 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.380
 Parents thus ensure that their children receive the culture in a positive way. 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.100
 It's great, and language is the first thing we want to teach 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.030
 To our children when we are outside our country. 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.740
 [What is the purpose of "Pocoyo"?] Since the first day of our creation of the "Pocoyo" series, 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.680
 Our goal was to reach the whole world. 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.510
 We wanted the Pocoyo network to be global. 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.580
 We did not want to be a sexual "Bukoyo" 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.000
 Or a single culture or language. 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.090
 It is often interesting 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.520
 When people realize that "Pokoyo" is not English 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.950
 Or not Russian or not Japanese. 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.800
 "We thought that Pocoyo was Indian, Mexican or American," they say. 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.320
 But no, "Pocoyo" from all over the world. from everywhere. 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.840
 No nationality, and how much we reported it 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.940
 At the time of global proliferation, I emphasize 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.520
 That this was our first intention when we founded the network. 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.710
 [How do you reach a "broad audience"?] We make a lot of effort to make sure our content is accessible to our followers 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.600
 Not only through language diversification, but also lists of choices. 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.740
 Each week we upload a list of choices or we complete 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.620
 Or add more content to previous selection lists, 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.580
 Making content more appealing to viewers 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.750
 Because they can interact with content. 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.950
