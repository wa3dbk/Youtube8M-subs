00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.900
 Well 

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:16.470
 so on which games so my name is pierre 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.840
 and and me and I make a video this time 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.340
 for finally what and it and he asked 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.689
 me the garden well I used to be a while 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.699
 ago from hot and so I can once 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.380
 create a video for you on your channel 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.420
 and that we are also going to do it at the foot 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.070
 highline so I have deliberate moments there 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.900
 waited until the moment that both 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.850
 treaty line almost came true 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.739
 as very many of you will know at 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.980
 the foot center line appear on March 19 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.410
 in the Netherlands and my question is you look 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.030
 now really looking forward to this game or not because 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.920
 there are many different opinions 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.960
 about this time with whether or not they like him 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.059
 go buy it and I personally like it 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.619
 really a super cool game for the people 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.690
 who played the b will be stuck 

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:52.769
 understand why the game is so great 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.180
 is 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:55.559
 the game is of course very different 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.970
 because we are used to it is none 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.229
 military shooter but it's one 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.699
 police shooter 

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:01.920
 it is a completely new way that they 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.869
 have been smashed but I think it is one 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.010
 successful way out of his very much 

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:06.900
 people can't get used to the idea 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.549
 that it is different from what she is used to 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.270
 are and are not open to the shoe 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.520
 something new 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.770
 a lot of people who decide that while 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.300
 they didn't even play the better 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.550
 and I can assure you if you 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.050
 the bites have played it very much to you 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.850
 certainly has a garden about it 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.920
 super cool game is going to be because me 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.360
 must also be very honest and the beginning 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.680
 I was also not convinced that it was real 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.659
 fat game was going to be it looked 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.190
 all very fat but I was not 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.390
 sure if it is actually my type 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.560
 become a game you 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.030
 is, of course, can be a gay bar fat 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.740
 his roots are so much fucking fat 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.940
 games but there just aren't any of them 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.770
 games that I like to play 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.300
 and there I was in the beginning there 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.550
 a little left to doubt until I 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.780
 The better played while I played the better 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.610
 stuff came one more and more behind 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.330
 is that this game post is super awesome 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.490
 will become 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.630
 it is going to be super fat and that he is 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.280
 can only get better 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.229
 for the beta lead past the foot of the hedge 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.540
 was just super good was super flexible 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.580
 nice gameplays almost flowed 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.740
 no problems and of course shutter 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.840
 here and there some bbc some songs 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.549
 for me it is a better and better 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.350
 and use them to test how the game 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.270
 currently playing what they have and 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.590
 from there they will adjust things 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.590
 are they going to improve things or even 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.790
 Hide things about it on the head 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.980
 seen so must say the game 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.299
 was very good 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.250
 and so I have following the 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.909
 better own chosen to the game so 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.980
 are going to buy 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:21.719
 I will not preorder the game itself that is 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.720
 not necessary because i d happen to get the 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:25.490
 game sent from idea because they 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.470
 we are live but otherwise I had the game 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.930
 also this pre-empted because if you like the game 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.230
 Priorat you get the only extras there 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.960
 you 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.970
 The ones you get are two or three 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:36.650
 extra weapons and therefore you cannot release them 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.670
 play if you have not pre-ordered 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:43.160
 but you pay almost 10 euros more 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.840
 get three extra weapons and you have 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.250
 and who this free juicy or something 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.750
 similar to that 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:49.280
 not to mention that your ten is not in terms of 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.710
 would get calling packs 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.750
 and that's it that's all you need 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.400
 if you get the game recorder and yes that 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.890
 I thought the 10 euros was just not worth it 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.840
 since I experience the enormously bad 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.280
 had to create bedding 4 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.780
 this time I have dropped it 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.540
 I didn't want the same again 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.160
 make a mistake I made before 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.810
 so if you still have doubts about the game 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.820
 I recommend you just go to the game 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.520
 buy if you like the details that plays 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.830
 at least if you have the better now 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.330
 played I expect the game evo 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.670
 off so then wait until he is in the 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.740
 offer is with then buy but it is 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.030
 definitely worth the game for this 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.260
 to purchase 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.820
 if you were very interested 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.530
 being in everything is happening around 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.970

 about what they are going to improve and choose what 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.250
 in addition to that or what a road goes then 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.230
