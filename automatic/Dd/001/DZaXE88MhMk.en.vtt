use a ol Claim body but they just kept

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:03.840 
use a ol Claim body but they just kept
having<00:01:02.440> loose<00:01:02.710> joints<00:01:03.159> and<00:01:03.309> it<00:01:03.460> was<00:01:03.550> too<00:01:03.699> much

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
having loose joints and it was too much

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.220 
having loose joints and it was too much
work<00:01:04.059> to<00:01:04.210> crack<00:01:04.420> the<00:01:04.540> chest<00:01:04.780> and<00:01:04.930> tighten<00:01:05.199> up

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.760 
all the shoulders in the ab crunch and
everything<00:01:07.090> so<00:01:07.360> we<00:01:08.020> decided<00:01:08.320> to<00:01:08.409> just<00:01:08.590> go<00:01:08.740> with

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
everything so we decided to just go with

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.140 
everything so we decided to just go with
the<00:01:08.920> warpath<00:01:09.370> because<00:01:09.700> he<00:01:09.790> had<00:01:09.880> the<00:01:09.940> cool

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
the warpath because he had the cool

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.149 
the warpath because he had the cool
gloves<00:01:10.450> and<00:01:10.780> the<00:01:11.020> he<00:01:11.799> didn't<00:01:11.979> have<00:01:12.070> the

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
gloves and the he didn't have the

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:14.160 
gloves and the he didn't have the
checkered<00:01:12.520> backs<00:01:12.729> on<00:01:12.939> them<00:01:13.060> either<00:01:13.180> and<00:01:13.899> it

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
checkered backs on them either and it

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.359 
checkered backs on them either and it
turned<00:01:14.350> out<00:01:14.439> we<00:01:14.560> want<00:01:14.740> we<00:01:14.799> could<00:01:14.950> use<00:01:15.100> his<00:01:15.220> head

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
turned out we want we could use his head

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:17.730 
turned out we want we could use his head
really<00:01:15.700> well<00:01:15.850> too<00:01:16.090> so<00:01:16.119> we<00:01:16.540> repurposed<00:01:17.110> that<00:01:17.320> um

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
really well too so we repurposed that um

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.940 
really well too so we repurposed that um
I<00:01:18.720> guess<00:01:19.720> I<00:01:19.840> should<00:01:19.990> get<00:01:20.079> into<00:01:20.439> let's<00:01:20.770> do<00:01:20.860> the

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.069 
I guess I should get into let's do the
accessories<00:01:21.399> first<00:01:21.670> why<00:01:21.820> not<00:01:22.060> he<00:01:22.570> has<00:01:22.750> the

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:23.079 
accessories first why not he has the

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:25.410 
accessories first why not he has the
double<00:01:23.920> pistols<00:01:24.369> on<00:01:24.490> the<00:01:24.579> back<00:01:24.729> I<00:01:24.850> repurposed

was pretty cool with the wooden grips on
there<00:01:44.340> just<00:01:45.340> a<00:01:45.579> kind<00:01:46.270> of<00:01:46.299> a<00:01:46.420> menacing<00:01:46.840> looking

he's got the shotgun that I mentioned

thing<00:03:52.150> connected<00:03:52.960> to<00:03:53.170> a<00:03:53.500> little<00:03:54.040> bit<00:03:54.100> long<00:03:54.340> but

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
thing connected to a little bit long but

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.310 
thing connected to a little bit long but
that's<00:03:55.240> the<00:03:55.390> way<00:03:55.480> it<00:03:55.570> came<00:03:55.720> and<00:03:55.930> I<00:03:55.960> didn't<00:03:56.200> want

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
that's the way it came and I didn't want

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.910 
that's the way it came and I didn't want
to<00:03:56.380> chop<00:03:56.980> it<00:03:57.160> up<00:03:57.250> connected<00:03:58.180> to<00:03:58.330> the<00:03:58.510> pouch<00:03:58.920> go

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
to chop it up connected to the pouch go

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.410 
to chop it up connected to the pouch go
ahead<00:04:00.040> and<00:04:00.130> zoom<00:04:00.250> out<00:04:00.490> so<00:04:00.790> you<00:04:00.880> can<00:04:00.970> see<00:04:01.000> that<00:04:01.390> a

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
ahead and zoom out so you can see that a

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.250 
ahead and zoom out so you can see that a
little<00:04:01.570> better<00:04:02.460> so<00:04:03.460> he's<00:04:03.580> got<00:04:03.760> the<00:04:04.020> pouch<00:04:05.020> in

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
little better so he's got the pouch in

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.830 
little better so he's got the pouch in
the<00:04:05.290> ammo<00:04:05.560> or<00:04:05.830> in<00:04:05.950> the<00:04:06.100> minigun<00:04:06.910> how<00:04:07.540> it's<00:04:07.660> just

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
the ammo or in the minigun how it's just

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.280 
the ammo or in the minigun how it's just
right<00:04:08.080> draped<00:04:08.470> over<00:04:08.650> his<00:04:08.830> shoulder<00:04:10.290> hangs

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
right draped over his shoulder hangs

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.400 
right draped over his shoulder hangs
nicely<00:04:11.440> there<00:04:12.420> now<00:04:13.420> the<00:04:13.480> tree<00:04:13.959> is<00:04:13.989> kind<00:04:14.380> of

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
nicely there now the tree is kind of

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.949 
nicely there now the tree is kind of
tricky<00:04:14.590> to<00:04:14.770> get<00:04:14.950> the<00:04:15.130> minigun<00:04:15.730> to<00:04:16.390> fit<00:04:16.720> in<00:04:16.870> his

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
tricky to get the minigun to fit in his

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.970 
tricky to get the minigun to fit in his
hand<00:04:19.109> because<00:04:20.109> he's<00:04:20.230> got<00:04:20.380> these<00:04:20.500> big<00:04:20.739> hands

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980 
hand because he's got these big hands

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.890 
hand because he's got these big hands
that<00:04:21.130> don't<00:04:21.280> have<00:04:21.430> any<00:04:21.580> hinges<00:04:22.000> in<00:04:22.150> them<00:04:22.270> but

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
that don't have any hinges in them but

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.780 
that don't have any hinges in them but
uh<00:04:22.960> after<00:04:23.740> a<00:04:23.770> little<00:04:23.950> tweaking<00:04:24.370> you<00:04:24.520> can<00:04:24.640> get

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
uh after a little tweaking you can get

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:25.980 
uh after a little tweaking you can get
him<00:04:24.880> to<00:04:24.970> hold<00:04:25.120> it<00:04:25.360> I'm<00:04:25.480> not<00:04:25.660> going<00:04:25.810> to<00:04:25.870> bother

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
him to hold it I'm not going to bother

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:29.100 
him to hold it I'm not going to bother
right<00:04:26.410> now<00:04:26.620> because<00:04:27.190> we're<00:04:27.790> have<00:04:28.110> limited

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
right now because we're have limited

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.070 
right now because we're have limited
time<00:04:30.180> I'll<00:04:31.180> just<00:04:31.330> kind<00:04:31.510> of<00:04:31.570> set<00:04:31.840> it<00:04:31.870> in<00:04:32.050> place

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
time I'll just kind of set it in place

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.440 
time I'll just kind of set it in place
like<00:04:32.530> that<00:04:32.770> so<00:04:33.130> you<00:04:33.220> can<00:04:33.280> see<00:04:33.370> but<00:04:34.210> there<00:04:34.360> you

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
like that so you can see but there you

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.440 
go he's got the minigun I need to stick

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
it in some hot water because it's bent a

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.150 
it in some hot water because it's bent a
little<00:04:37.480> bit<00:04:37.870> but<00:04:38.140> he's<00:04:38.290> got<00:04:38.470> the<00:04:38.560> minigun<00:04:38.919> with
