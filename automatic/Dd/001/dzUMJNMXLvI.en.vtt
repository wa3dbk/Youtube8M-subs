00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.940
 Hazelnut 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.700
 yes I 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.770
 data and after we estimate that's it 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.360
 it's all steaming while steaming 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.759
 a little bit of blender just now 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.610
 you know it I can not wait to see it go on 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:27.939
 is going to leave the boats but then 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.949
 simply for carrots and in 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.660
 sticks and that's it 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:34.059
 partitioned sticks we are going to put 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.989
 in the dish you leave everything in condition 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:36.820
 by the hour, let's go 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.220
 the carrots are ready we want to light 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.150
 the oven what beating mode to see 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.410
 which is good with the steam oven 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:41.769
 company is that we actually do this 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.900
 we want 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:46.150
 look we choose menu we will 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.400
 walk it's super easy thigh have 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.600
 assisted at startup 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.930
 what am i doing 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.180
 the vegetables I'm going to leather forty 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.920
 years old looking for a carrot analyzer 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.760
 blooming good that became the day 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.670
 on carrots 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:04.000
 ok I took another to do that 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.670
 to do and you see he tells me to add 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.659
 a little bit of steam so why m 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.750
 just a little water in there 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:14.320
 because he is missing 60 centimeters of water 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:18.400
 super possible I put the dish and 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.570
 lock up and go away then it's okay 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.950
 let cool a small price 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.780
 we will mixes and after this time 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.770
 his deal okay we'll crush the 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.720
 hazelnuts that are going to him now 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.020

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.980
 I had said to those simple words for 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.980
 the mixer and that's it and that's it 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.720

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.340
 for 200 g how much do you see it 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.780
 I really do not think so 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:14.550
 the seasoning was filmed these tunnels 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:15.690
 and seasonings here you go excessively 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.970
 homogeneous we go then the 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.510
 seasonings five caniles up plays 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.790
 muscles 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.750
 belleville we will put him also when 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:30.230
 teaspoons of hazelnut oil 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:30.230
 that's fine you know what 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.930
 its good 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.730
 amar is the cream so everything is weighed 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.570
 everything sold at 200 grams more than two 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:47.910
 wish the yellow 200 g to drag that we have 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.040
 creamy flanks here and especially 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.890
 especially how are we going to cook them in a 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.300
 steam oven that will stay very very 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:03:02.520
 high that's going to be cooked but it will be 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:05.700
 so you're at all bassett 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:08.790
 defendants have filled jars way whose 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.950
 the sous then it's a lot does not have them 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.440
 no real because we will serve the 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.810
 flank right now in it's a lot 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.190
 but otherwise if you have ramekins 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.190
 wanted to unmould we must release 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:27.480
 so we'll just do two things 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:32.880
 move slowly it's just for 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:35.900
 to hunt a nice pair of hazelnuts 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.900
 that they will fall everybody 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.600
 so there will be hazelnuts above 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.340
 a little bit yes god it will spread 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.650
 movement so now he stays 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.780
 clear everything seems so do we'll go 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.090
 to the cloud including the free football 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:52.380
 via a program for that, let's go 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:55.710
 you have super simple sick menu can 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.810
 have attended cookbook or even you 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:01.740

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:03.840
 florin alas the rain on me I 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.940

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:15.560
 we left north start request for 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.560
 add waters 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.560
 at home baked so we put 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.570
 premises that closes 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.890
 if you fired yourself in 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.320
 ramekins you just have to cover it with 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:29.720
 food paper by a small paper 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.390

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:36.800
 easy in the oven to the program finds 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.440
 a point it works alone the press 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.390
