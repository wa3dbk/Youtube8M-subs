00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.440
 at 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.920
 she asks me if life I hope that 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.810
 you are well I find you this 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.430
 week for two measures inventory 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.410
 so it's true he's different 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.509
 I think most of you have 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.840
 already made aware of what desires 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:32.250
 brought this weekend but I got 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.410
 said why not do it anyway 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.330
 that of the words since there is probably 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.120
 people who play a lot less 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.710
 to define that before and communicated that 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.600
 two weeks and iard really 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.640
 nice to ask me I thought 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.559
 why not make this video just in case 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.750
 this is to revisit after the occasion 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.519
 to simply buy the on them 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.440
 because it is the army that is in vain 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:53.879
 this week my physics that I you 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.920
 highly recommend if it is 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.280
 very very powerful especially on the 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.659
 length made very effective also 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.400
 brought to the mom a lot of power 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:05.010
 a lot of precision and that's it 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.350
 simply already exotic oil he 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.580
 must absolutely possible in destinies 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.750
 of death if you are a player of 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.030
 first rank since it is part 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.390
 consent of the arts that have the most 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.860
 charisma in this game side man clip for 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.140
 this week in your box not me 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.600
 pity for the titans radar bedridden 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.670
 heading for hunters and green dam 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.939
 will pay for the arcades to my grain of 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.799
 helmets for the exotic g in demetri 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.719
 we find the ass of impulses 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.820
 the scout the scout and let neither of 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:35.189
 precisions and again and again like 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.320
 usually the violet broadcast 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.759
 little reminder also in two small 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.380
 things for people who do not have 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.810
 follow up I remember there is still and 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.050
 always the way of doing this 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.360
 this week 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.800
 there is their route osiris for the week 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.050
 end and I believe that the maps of this 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.650
 week it's simply the temple 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.690
 1 core goes down 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.580
