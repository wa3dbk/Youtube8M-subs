00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
not bad um I don't think it does

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.790

anything<00:03:24.020> crazy<00:03:24.440> for<00:03:25.069> my<00:03:25.190> lashes<00:03:26.620> but<00:03:27.620> it's

anything crazy for my lashes but it's

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.320 
anything crazy for my lashes but it's

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
not bad it's actually a little bit

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.540 
not bad it's actually a little bit
better<00:03:29.510> than<00:03:29.660> I<00:03:29.780> thought<00:03:29.959> it<00:03:30.140> could<00:03:30.349> be<00:03:30.380> so<00:03:30.890> I'm

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
better than I thought it could be so I'm

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:32.710 
better than I thought it could be so I'm
going<00:03:31.700> to<00:03:31.730> go<00:03:31.849> ahead<00:03:31.880> and<00:03:32.030> apply<00:03:32.209> a<00:03:32.390> little<00:03:32.599> bit

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
going to go ahead and apply a little bit

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.660 
going to go ahead and apply a little bit
more<00:03:32.989> and<00:03:33.230> kind<00:03:33.560> of<00:03:33.650> wait<00:03:33.890> for<00:03:34.130> the<00:03:34.280> coat<00:03:34.489> to

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
more and kind of wait for the coat to

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:35.890 
more and kind of wait for the coat to
sit<00:03:34.849> in<00:03:34.970> because<00:03:35.180> I<00:03:35.269> think<00:03:35.330> you<00:03:35.540> can<00:03:35.720> really

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
sit in because I think you can really

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.380 
sit in because I think you can really
build<00:03:36.170> this<00:03:36.380> mascara<00:03:36.860> it's<00:03:37.400> not<00:03:37.760> clumpy<00:03:38.180> at

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390

build this mascara it's not clumpy at
all<00:03:38.630> I<00:03:39.500> think<00:03:39.890> that<00:03:40.069> it<00:03:40.250> doesn't<00:03:40.940> really

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
all I think that it doesn't really

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:46.440 
all I think that it doesn't really
lengthen<00:03:41.630> lashes<00:03:41.870> but<00:03:42.410> I<00:03:42.470> think<00:03:42.769> that<00:03:42.830> um<00:03:43.280> I

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:04:00.809

supernatural and which is really nice
okay<00:05:01.010> so<00:05:01.070> this<00:05:01.310> is<00:05:01.490> a<00:05:01.520> close<00:05:01.820> up<00:05:01.850> of<00:05:02.300> my<00:05:02.389> lashes

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:14.670 
I'll see that it's pretty messy for me I

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.240 
I'll see that it's pretty messy for me I
get<00:05:15.000> it<00:05:15.030> all<00:05:15.270> over<00:05:15.780> my<00:05:15.990> upper<00:05:16.320> lash<00:05:16.530> I'm<00:05:16.920> in<00:05:17.100> my

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
get it all over my upper lash I'm in my

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.540 
get it all over my upper lash I'm in my
upper<00:05:17.490> lid<00:05:17.670> which<00:05:18.600> kind<00:05:18.870> of<00:05:18.960> is<00:05:19.050> annoying<00:05:19.550> the

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
upper lid which kind of is annoying the

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.340 
upper lid which kind of is annoying the
brush<00:05:20.760> is<00:05:20.790> pretty<00:05:21.180> big<00:05:21.360> that's<00:05:21.960> the<00:05:22.140> only

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
brush is pretty big that's the only

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:24.380 
brush is pretty big that's the only
thing<00:05:22.640> another<00:05:23.640> thing<00:05:23.880> that<00:05:24.000> I<00:05:24.030> don't<00:05:24.150> like

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390 
thing another thing that I don't like

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:27.500 
thing another thing that I don't like
about<00:05:24.540> it<00:05:24.780> is<00:05:25.020> it<00:05:25.260> doesn't<00:05:25.880> provide<00:05:26.880> a<00:05:26.910> lot<00:05:27.300> of

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
about it is it doesn't provide a lot of

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:28.880 
about it is it doesn't provide a lot of
product<00:05:27.960> on<00:05:28.110> the<00:05:28.230> brush<00:05:28.260> I<00:05:28.530> feel<00:05:28.680> like<00:05:28.740> I'm

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:28.890 
product on the brush I feel like I'm

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:31.010 
product on the brush I feel like I'm
always<00:05:29.160> constantly<00:05:29.610> dipping<00:05:30.090> in<00:05:30.300> and<00:05:30.480> I<00:05:30.840> don't

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
always constantly dipping in and I don't

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.960 
always constantly dipping in and I don't
know<00:05:31.110> if<00:05:31.260> that's<00:05:31.440> the<00:05:31.650> waterproof<00:05:32.190> formula<00:05:32.550> or

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:32.970 
know if that's the waterproof formula or

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.550 
know if that's the waterproof formula or
not<00:05:33.090> because<00:05:33.270> it's<00:05:33.480> kind<00:05:33.600> of<00:05:33.750> a<00:05:33.960> little<00:05:34.470> bit

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
not because it's kind of a little bit

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.440 
not because it's kind of a little bit
wax<00:05:34.740> here<00:05:35.010> I<00:05:35.070> think<00:05:35.400> waterproof<00:05:35.850> mascara<00:05:36.270> is

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:36.450 
wax here I think waterproof mascara is

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.860 
wax here I think waterproof mascara is
but<00:05:36.930> um<00:05:37.820> overall<00:05:38.820> I<00:05:38.850> think<00:05:39.000> it<00:05:39.270> provides<00:05:39.480> a

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
but um overall I think it provides a

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:41.990 
but um overall I think it provides a
really<00:05:40.440> natural<00:05:40.710> look<00:05:41.190> it's<00:05:41.430> not<00:05:41.640> anything

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:42.000 
really natural look it's not anything

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.490 
really natural look it's not anything
dramatic<00:05:42.630> which<00:05:42.780> I'm<00:05:42.960> more<00:05:43.230> of<00:05:43.320> a<00:05:43.350> dramatic

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
dramatic which I'm more of a dramatic

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.800 
dramatic which I'm more of a dramatic
girl<00:05:44.100> with<00:05:44.730> my<00:05:44.850> lashes<00:05:45.120> because<00:05:45.450> I<00:05:45.630> were<00:05:45.780> a

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
girl with my lashes because I were a

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.020 
girl with my lashes because I were a
pretty<00:05:46.050> simple<00:05:46.440> makeup<00:05:46.560> but<00:05:47.310> it<00:05:47.580> provides

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
pretty simple makeup but it provides

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.680 
pretty simple makeup but it provides
length<00:05:48.510> volume<00:05:49.260> and<00:05:49.830> clump<00:05:50.730> free<00:05:51.030> but<00:05:51.540> it's

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
length volume and clump free but it's

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.660 
length volume and clump free but it's
just<00:05:51.930> not<00:05:51.990> as<00:05:52.200> dramatic<00:05:52.710> as<00:05:52.890> I<00:05:53.040> like<00:05:53.340> it<00:05:53.550> I

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:53.670 
just not as dramatic as I like it I

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:55.940 
just not as dramatic as I like it I
don't<00:05:53.910> think<00:05:53.970> it's<00:05:54.210> as<00:05:54.360> black<00:05:54.720> and<00:05:54.990> dark<00:05:55.710> and

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:55.950 
don't think it's as black and dark and

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:58.310 
don't think it's as black and dark and
dramatic<00:05:56.070> as<00:05:56.520> I<00:05:56.640> like<00:05:56.820> it<00:05:57.000> but<00:05:57.240> it<00:05:57.570> is<00:05:57.870> overall

00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:58.320 
dramatic as I like it but it is overall

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:59.900 
dramatic as I like it but it is overall
really<00:05:58.650> nice<00:05:58.860> mascara<00:05:59.370> if<00:05:59.430> you're<00:05:59.550> looking

00:05:59.900 --> 00:05:59.910 
really nice mascara if you're looking

really nice mascara if you're looking
for<00:05:59.940> something<00:06:00.330> that's<00:06:00.510> kind<00:06:00.870> of<00:06:00.960> natural<00:06:01.470> but

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:01.950 
for something that's kind of natural but

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:03.560 
for something that's kind of natural but
just<00:06:02.160> provides<00:06:02.490> like<00:06:02.670> a<00:06:02.700> really<00:06:02.910> fanned<00:06:03.270> out

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:03.570 
just provides like a really fanned out

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:07.370 
just provides like a really fanned out
look<00:06:04.560> this<00:06:05.190> is<00:06:05.400> the<00:06:05.490> mascara<00:06:05.970> for<00:06:06.210> you<00:06:06.510> um<00:06:06.840> I

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840 
don't know if again it depends on

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.930 
don't know if again it depends on
whether<00:06:10.020> i<00:06:10.140> got<00:06:10.320> waterproof<00:06:10.770> or<00:06:10.920> regular<00:06:11.430> but

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
whether i got waterproof or regular but

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.900 
whether i got waterproof or regular but
there<00:06:12.150> is<00:06:12.180> ZERO<00:06:12.840> clumping<00:06:13.440> even<00:06:14.430> though<00:06:14.580> i<00:06:14.610> had

there is ZERO clumping even though i had

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:16.550

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 
to like build it up so much because i

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.840 
to like build it up so much because i
felt<00:06:16.770> like<00:06:16.830> it<00:06:17.010> wasn't<00:06:17.190> providing<00:06:17.640> enough

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:17.850 
felt like it wasn't providing enough

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:19.790 
felt like it wasn't providing enough
product<00:06:18.120> i<00:06:18.360> still<00:06:18.780> did<00:06:18.960> not<00:06:18.990> get<00:06:19.260> any<00:06:19.410> clumping

mascara<00:06:24.120> it's<00:06:24.240> not<00:06:24.390> going<00:06:24.480> to<00:06:24.570> be<00:06:24.630> my<00:06:24.750> new<00:06:24.900> baby

mascara it's not going to be my new baby
but<00:06:25.830> i<00:06:25.860> think<00:06:26.190> it's<00:06:26.340> a<00:06:26.430> nice<00:06:26.670> formula<00:06:27.660> if

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:27.990 
but i think it's a nice formula if

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:29.440 
but i think it's a nice formula if
you're<00:06:28.170> just<00:06:28.320> looking<00:06:28.410> for<00:06:28.650> very<00:06:28.950> simple

growing um do to do 20 and what I do
think<00:06:46.470> is<00:06:46.680> I<00:06:46.860> have<00:06:47.040> tried<00:06:47.190> the<00:06:47.370> original<00:06:47.850> girl

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.060 
think is I have tried the original girl

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.390 
think is I have tried the original girl
lashes<00:06:48.450> and<00:06:48.600> I<00:06:48.990> find<00:06:49.650> that<00:06:49.710> it's<00:06:49.890> a<00:06:49.950> lot<00:06:50.130> wetter

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 
lashes and I find that it's a lot wetter

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.950 
lashes and I find that it's a lot wetter
than<00:06:50.700> the<00:06:50.850> original<00:06:51.270> girl<00:06:51.450> lashes<00:06:51.780> the

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:51.960 
than the original girl lashes the

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.320 
than the original girl lashes the
original<00:06:52.710> girl<00:06:52.860> lashes<00:06:53.190> for<00:06:53.340> me<00:06:53.520> was<00:06:53.730> very<00:06:53.970> dry

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:54.330 
original girl lashes for me was very dry

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.240 
original girl lashes for me was very dry
but<00:06:55.110> I<00:06:55.140> wasn't<00:06:55.530> a<00:06:55.560> huge<00:06:55.650> fan<00:06:55.770> of<00:06:55.920> it<00:06:56.070> but<00:06:56.190> the

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:56.250 
but I wasn't a huge fan of it but the

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:57.830 
but I wasn't a huge fan of it but the
brushes<00:06:56.520> are<00:06:56.610> pretty<00:06:56.790> similar<00:06:57.000> I<00:06:57.300> think<00:06:57.750> the

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:57.840 
brushes are pretty similar I think the

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.330 
brushes are pretty similar I think the
formula<00:06:58.260> except<00:06:58.590> for<00:06:58.740> the<00:06:58.800> fact<00:06:58.890> that<00:06:59.040> it's<00:06:59.250> a

00:06:59.330 --> 00:06:59.340 
formula except for the fact that it's a

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.940 
formula except for the fact that it's a
little<00:06:59.640> um<00:06:59.910> this<00:07:00.660> one's<00:07:00.900> a<00:07:00.990> little<00:07:01.110> wetter<00:07:01.410> the

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:01.950 
little um this one's a little wetter the

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:03.530 
little um this one's a little wetter the
other<00:07:02.070> one<00:07:02.250> was<00:07:02.370> a<00:07:02.400> little<00:07:02.460> drier<00:07:02.820> but<00:07:03.030> if

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:03.540 
other one was a little drier but if

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:04.760
