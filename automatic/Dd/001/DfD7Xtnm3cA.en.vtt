00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:29.009 
somebody was home I wanted to get a key
from<00:03:24.280> them<00:03:24.580> so<00:03:24.930> how<00:03:25.930> you<00:03:25.989> do<00:03:26.230> awesome<00:03:28.019> alright

from them so how you do awesome alright

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:30.150 
from them so how you do awesome alright
we're<00:03:29.200> going<00:03:29.290> to<00:03:29.379> hold<00:03:29.500> up<00:03:29.620> to<00:03:29.650> the<00:03:29.799> finance

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
we're going to hold up to the finance

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.550 
we're going to hold up to the finance
company<00:03:30.580> and<00:03:30.940> I<00:03:31.120> guess<00:03:31.390> there's<00:03:32.379> some

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
company and I guess there's some

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.500 
company and I guess there's some
obviously<00:03:33.489> which<00:03:33.640> is<00:03:33.670> passing<00:03:34.150> away<00:03:34.239> there'll

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
obviously which is passing away there'll

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:35.610 
obviously which is passing away there'll
be<00:03:34.540> some<00:03:34.750> details<00:03:35.110> that<00:03:35.230> they<00:03:35.319> need<00:03:35.440> to<00:03:35.500> work

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
be some details that they need to work

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.100 
be some details that they need to work
out<00:03:35.829> but<00:03:36.269> they<00:03:37.269> can<00:03:37.480> definitely<00:03:37.569> get<00:03:37.959> the

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
out but they can definitely get the

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.850 
out but they can definitely get the
vehicle<00:03:38.440> back

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
vehicle back

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.500 
vehicle back
I<00:03:38.890> think<00:03:39.519> the<00:03:39.579> finance<00:03:39.910> company<00:03:40.150> just<00:03:40.299> wants

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
I think the finance company just wants

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.900 
I think the finance company just wants
to<00:03:40.599> hold<00:03:40.750> it<00:03:40.870> because<00:03:41.140> the<00:03:41.349> sole<00:03:41.790> person<00:03:42.790> that

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
to hold it because the sole person that

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.170 
to hold it because the sole person that
signed<00:03:43.120> the<00:03:43.269> loan<00:03:43.390> agreement<00:03:43.810> is<00:03:43.930> no<00:03:44.079> longer

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
signed the loan agreement is no longer

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.369 
signed the loan agreement is no longer
yeah<00:03:46.180> so<00:03:46.510> that<00:03:46.629> makes<00:03:46.810> them<00:03:46.930> a<00:03:47.049> little<00:03:47.170> bit

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:47.379 
yeah so that makes them a little bit

00:03:47.379 --> 00:04:04.920 
yeah so that makes them a little bit
worrisome<00:03:58.200> thank<00:03:59.200> you<00:04:03.540> all<00:04:04.540> right<00:04:04.629> yeah<00:04:04.900> I

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
worrisome thank you all right yeah I

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:06.119 
worrisome thank you all right yeah I
guess<00:04:05.079> if<00:04:05.379> you<00:04:05.440> want<00:04:05.560> to<00:04:05.650> put<00:04:05.769> it<00:04:05.859> give<00:04:06.010> it<00:04:06.040> a

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:06.129 
guess if you want to put it give it a

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:08.880 
guess if you want to put it give it a
technical<00:04:06.430> term<00:04:06.959> so<00:04:07.959> it's<00:04:08.290> kind<00:04:08.500> of<00:04:08.560> more<00:04:08.739> of<00:04:08.829> a

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
technical term so it's kind of more of a

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.380 
technical term so it's kind of more of a
temporary<00:04:09.069> holding<00:04:09.670> until<00:04:09.940> they<00:04:10.030> can<00:04:10.209> find

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
temporary holding until they can find

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:11.849 
temporary holding until they can find
