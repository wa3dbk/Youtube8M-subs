you're<00:00:58.320> multiplying<00:00:58.649> five<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.489> four<00:00:59.730> tenths

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
you're multiplying five and four tenths

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.299 
you're multiplying five and four tenths
by<00:01:00.480> 10<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.140> power<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.620> negative<00:01:01.859> eight

science
notation<00:02:14.370> we<00:02:15.270> can<00:02:15.450> see<00:02:15.690> that<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.990> number<00:02:16.260> on

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
notation we can see that the number on

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.080 
notation we can see that the number on
the<00:02:16.530> right<00:02:16.710> will<00:02:16.920> be<00:02:16.950> bigger<00:02:17.310> since<00:02:17.850> it<00:02:17.970> is

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
the right will be bigger since it is

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.440 
the right will be bigger since it is
multiplied<00:02:18.630> by<00:02:18.660> 10<00:02:19.140> to<00:02:19.320> the<00:02:19.350> power<00:02:19.470> of<00:02:19.800> 10

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
multiplying these numbers is a lot

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.950 
multiplying these numbers is a lot
easier<00:02:27.810> if<00:02:28.230> you<00:02:28.440> use<00:02:28.650> scientific<00:02:29.100> notation

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960 
easier if you use scientific notation

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.270 
easier if you use scientific notation
first<00:02:30.960> you<00:02:31.230> multiply<00:02:31.740> the<00:02:31.800> numbers

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
first you multiply the numbers

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.190 
first you multiply the numbers
separately<00:02:32.670> let's<00:02:33.510> round<00:02:33.750> four<00:02:34.170> and

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
separately let's round four and

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.830 
separately let's round four and
seventy-five<00:02:35.130> thousands<00:02:35.850> and<00:02:36.000> three<00:02:36.600> and

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
seventy-five thousands and three and

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.770 
seventy-five thousands and three and
ninety<00:02:37.350> five<00:02:37.560> hundredths<00:02:38.250> to<00:02:38.400> four<00:02:38.780> the

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
ninety five hundredths to four the

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.370 
ninety five hundredths to four the
product<00:02:40.290> of<00:02:40.410> four<00:02:40.680> times<00:02:41.010> four<00:02:41.400> is<00:02:41.430> sixteen

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
product of four times four is sixteen

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.040 
product of four times four is sixteen
next<00:02:43.380> you<00:02:43.980> multiply<00:02:44.490> the<00:02:44.550> powers<00:02:45.090> we<00:02:45.810> know

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
next you multiply the powers we know

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.500 
next you multiply the powers we know
when<00:02:46.440> powers<00:02:46.860> are<00:02:47.010> multiplied<00:02:47.490> exponents<00:02:48.420> are

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
when powers are multiplied exponents are

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.729 
when powers are multiplied exponents are
added<00:02:48.950> here<00:02:49.950> we<00:02:50.100> get<00:02:50.280> 10<00:02:50.550> to<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.820> power<00:02:51.000> of<00:02:51.300> 19

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
added here we get 10 to the power of 19

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.530 
added here we get 10 to the power of 19
the<00:02:52.739> product<00:02:53.190> of<00:02:53.310> these<00:02:53.459> two<00:02:53.730> numbers<00:02:53.760> is<00:02:54.330> very

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
the product of these two numbers is very

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.160 
the product of these two numbers is very
close<00:02:55.050> to<00:02:55.260> 16<00:02:55.830> times<00:02:56.220> 10<00:02:56.610> to<00:02:56.880> the<00:02:56.910> power<00:02:57.239> of<00:02:57.420> 19

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
close to 16 times 10 to the power of 19

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.310 
close to 16 times 10 to the power of 19
as<00:02:58.410> you<00:02:59.190> can<00:02:59.340> see<00:02:59.610> scientific<00:03:00.540> notation<00:03:01.110> makes

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
as you can see scientific notation makes

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.680 
as you can see scientific notation makes
it<00:03:01.530> much<00:03:01.680> easier<00:03:01.890> to<00:03:02.280> do<00:03:02.640> math<00:03:02.940> with<00:03:03.209> extreme

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
it much easier to do math with extreme

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.959 
it much easier to do math with extreme
numbers
