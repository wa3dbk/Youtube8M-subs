00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
and then you have another category of

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.240 
and then you have another category of
shrubs<00:00:03.899> called<00:00:04.259> the<00:00:04.350> can<00:00:04.560> growing<00:00:04.890> shrubs

these are plants that renew themselves

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.230 
these are plants that renew themselves
with<00:00:07.350> branches<00:00:07.919> that<00:00:08.130> arise<00:00:08.429> from<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:08.970> ground

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
with branches that arise from the ground

directly from the ground that would be

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.089 
directly from the ground that would be
things<00:00:11.280> like<00:00:11.370> bamboo<00:00:11.910> and<00:00:12.090> roses<00:00:12.480> and<00:00:13.099> these

things like bamboo and roses and these

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.919 
things like bamboo and roses and these
are<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.340> toughest<00:00:14.820> of<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.480> three<00:00:15.509> categories

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
are the toughest of the three categories

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.800 
are the toughest of the three categories
of<00:00:16.440> shrubs<00:00:16.770> cane<00:00:17.250> growers<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:18.539> pruning

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
of shrubs cane growers the pruning

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.700 
of shrubs cane growers the pruning
budget<00:00:19.289> is<00:00:19.439> large<00:00:19.980> and<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.460> preen<00:00:21.119> budget

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
budget is large and the preen budget

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.150 
budget is large and the preen budget
really<00:00:22.710> is<00:00:23.390> how<00:00:24.390> much<00:00:24.660> you<00:00:25.230> can<00:00:25.500> prune<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.769> plant

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
really is how much you can prune a plant

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.519 
really is how much you can prune a plant
and<00:00:26.519> how<00:00:26.789> hard<00:00:27.539> you're<00:00:27.750> comparing<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.260> plant

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
and how hard you're comparing a plant

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.999 
and how hard you're comparing a plant
without<00:00:29.220> getting<00:00:29.730> into<00:00:29.970> trouble<00:00:30.179> I<00:00:30.800> would<00:00:31.800> say

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
without getting into trouble I would say

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.560 
without getting into trouble I would say
that<00:00:32.189> you<00:00:32.279> can<00:00:32.430> remove<00:00:32.730> about<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.059> third<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.510> the

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
that you can remove about a third of the

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.510 
that you can remove about a third of the
foliage<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.230> reduce<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.770> plant<00:00:35.100> maybe<00:00:35.280> by<00:00:35.489> a

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
foliage and reduce a plant maybe by a

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.790 
foliage and reduce a plant maybe by a
third<00:00:35.880> of<00:00:36.000> its<00:00:36.120> height<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:36.719> you<00:00:37.469> do<00:00:37.620> that

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
third of its height and you do that

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.869 
third of its height and you do that
usually<00:00:38.160> by<00:00:38.309> cutting<00:00:38.670> canes<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.079> ground

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
usually by cutting canes to the ground

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:43.250 
usually by cutting canes to the ground
cut<00:00:41.879> those<00:00:42.090> canes<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.930> ground<00:00:43.110> or

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
cut those canes to the ground or

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.750 
cut those canes to the ground or
sometimes<00:00:43.590> 2<00:00:43.800> inches<00:00:44.070> above<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.460> ground

create<00:06:10.380> bushiness<00:06:10.890> there<00:06:11.310> so<00:06:12.000> we<00:06:12.150> actually

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:12.419 
create bushiness there so we actually

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:14.960 
create bushiness there so we actually
have<00:06:12.540> a<00:06:12.570> reason<00:06:12.990> to<00:06:13.260> do<00:06:13.500> it<00:06:13.650> so<00:06:14.430> you<00:06:14.490> get<00:06:14.729> very

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:14.970 
have a reason to do it so you get very

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:18.110 
have a reason to do it so you get very
brave<00:06:15.330> and<00:06:15.690> in<00:06:16.560> the<00:06:16.740> spring<00:06:17.070> or<00:06:17.310> I<00:06:17.580> guess<00:06:17.850> in

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 
brave and in the spring or I guess in

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.659 
brave and in the spring or I guess in
the<00:06:18.210> summer<00:06:18.419> or<00:06:18.690> maybe<00:06:19.050> even<00:06:19.140> in<00:06:19.560> the<00:06:19.650> fall<00:06:19.860> you

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:20.669 
the summer or maybe even in the fall you

00:06:20.669 --> 00:06:22.040 
the summer or maybe even in the fall you
would<00:06:20.790> cut<00:06:21.060> some<00:06:21.330> of<00:06:21.419> the<00:06:21.479> Canes<00:06:21.720> to<00:06:21.960> the

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050 
would cut some of the Canes to the

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.409 
would cut some of the Canes to the
ground<00:06:22.320> cut<00:06:23.010> some<00:06:23.250> of<00:06:23.310> the<00:06:23.400> Canes<00:06:23.640> off<00:06:23.940> down

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:24.419 
ground cut some of the Canes off down

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:26.020 
ground cut some of the Canes off down
inside

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:26.030 
inside

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:29.320 
inside
and<00:06:26.150> in<00:06:26.390> the<00:06:26.600> future<00:06:27.020> a<00:06:27.430> king<00:06:28.430> would<00:06:28.610> rise<00:06:28.910> from

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:29.330 
and in the future a king would rise from

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:32.200 
and in the future a king would rise from
the<00:06:29.720> ground<00:06:29.930> and<00:06:30.410> it<00:06:31.310> would<00:06:31.430> also<00:06:31.610> flush<00:06:32.000> out

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:32.210 
the ground and it would also flush out

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:34.720 
the ground and it would also flush out
from<00:06:32.450> that<00:06:32.600> cut<00:06:32.900> that<00:06:33.320> you<00:06:33.470> made<00:06:33.710> and<00:06:34.130> you<00:06:34.460> get

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:34.730 
from that cut that you made and you get

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:39.580 
from that cut that you made and you get
the<00:06:35.480> Nandina<00:06:35.990> on<00:06:36.320> the<00:06:36.830> right<00:06:38.230> you<00:06:39.230> should<00:06:39.410> know

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:39.590 
the Nandina on the right you should know

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:42.370 
the Nandina on the right you should know
that<00:06:39.920> you<00:06:40.910> can<00:06:41.060> also<00:06:41.270> radically<00:06:41.600> renovate<00:06:42.200> an

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:42.380 
that you can also radically renovate an

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:44.920 
that you can also radically renovate an
antenna<00:06:42.860> that's<00:06:43.310> also<00:06:43.970> why<00:06:44.150> it's<00:06:44.180> in<00:06:44.600> this

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:44.930 
antenna that's also why it's in this

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.010 
antenna that's also why it's in this
category<00:06:45.350> of<00:06:45.830> easy<00:06:46.250> plants<00:06:46.730> to<00:06:46.850> prune<00:06:47.120> I<00:06:47.360> had

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:48.020 
category of easy plants to prune I had

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.290 
category of easy plants to prune I had
some<00:06:48.290> of<00:06:48.380> these<00:06:48.440> legging<00:06:49.280> Indians<00:06:49.760> in<00:06:49.940> my<00:06:50.060> yard

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:50.300 
some of these legging Indians in my yard

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.140 
some of these legging Indians in my yard
and<00:06:50.630> there<00:06:51.380> was<00:06:51.500> a<00:06:51.530> camera<00:06:52.340> crew<00:06:52.580> coming<00:06:52.850> to

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:53.150 
and there was a camera crew coming to

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:56.500 
and there was a camera crew coming to
film<00:06:53.660> some<00:06:54.020> garden<00:06:54.650> segments<00:06:55.070> and<00:06:55.250> I<00:06:56.060> panicked

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:56.510 
film some garden segments and I panicked

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:58.810 
film some garden segments and I panicked
and<00:06:56.990> did<00:06:57.290> what<00:06:57.440> any<00:06:57.620> sensible<00:06:57.920> person<00:06:58.220> was<00:06:58.670> I

00:06:58.810 --> 00:06:58.820 
and did what any sensible person was I

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:00.820 
and did what any sensible person was I
just<00:06:59.060> cut<00:06:59.270> them<00:06:59.420> to<00:06:59.540> the<00:06:59.570> ground<00:06:59.810> and<00:07:00.080> and<00:07:00.320> had

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:00.830 
just cut them to the ground and and had

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:03.910 
just cut them to the ground and and had
hid<00:07:01.310> the<00:07:01.460> foliage<00:07:02.290> because<00:07:03.290> I<00:07:03.320> didn't<00:07:03.740> want

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:03.920 
hid the foliage because I didn't want

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.210 
hid the foliage because I didn't want
them<00:07:04.070> to<00:07:04.100> think<00:07:04.460> I<00:07:04.550> was<00:07:04.730> a<00:07:04.760> bad<00:07:05.180> gardener<00:07:05.960> and

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:06.220 
them to think I was a bad gardener and

oh<00:07:22.660> maybe<00:07:23.660> me<00:07:23.990> and<00:07:24.640> you'd<00:07:25.640> be<00:07:25.820> surprised<00:07:26.300> how

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:26.660 
oh maybe me and you'd be surprised how

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:31.570 
oh maybe me and you'd be surprised how
quickly<00:07:27.050> it<00:07:27.440> regrows<00:07:29.710> here<00:07:30.710> is<00:07:30.830> an<00:07:30.950> example<00:07:31.280> of

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:31.580 
quickly it regrows here is an example of

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:35.610 
quickly it regrows here is an example of
some<00:07:31.880> bad<00:07:32.270> pruning<00:07:33.110> and<00:07:33.470> I<00:07:34.430> gotta<00:07:34.730> say<00:07:35.000> uh

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:35.620 
some bad pruning and I gotta say uh

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:37.870 
some bad pruning and I gotta say uh
annoyed<00:07:36.620> me<00:07:36.830> when<00:07:36.950> I<00:07:37.040> saw<00:07:37.220> the<00:07:37.280> grounds<00:07:37.670> crew

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:37.880 
annoyed me when I saw the grounds crew

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.280 
annoyed me when I saw the grounds crew
had<00:07:38.120> done<00:07:38.360> this<00:07:38.540> but<00:07:38.780> then<00:07:38.960> there<00:07:39.110> also

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:39.290 
had done this but then there also

00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:41.500 
had done this but then there also
occurred<00:07:39.860> to<00:07:40.070> me<00:07:40.220> what's<00:07:41.090> the<00:07:41.180> difference

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:41.510 
occurred to me what's the difference

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:43.420 
occurred to me what's the difference
between<00:07:41.690> that<00:07:41.930> and<00:07:42.320> the<00:07:42.770> pruning<00:07:42.980> I<00:07:43.190> just

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:43.430 
between that and the pruning I just

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:47.350 
between that and the pruning I just
showed<00:07:43.700> and<00:07:44.300> I<00:07:44.810> guess<00:07:45.730> one<00:07:46.730> of<00:07:46.760> the<00:07:46.880> reason<00:07:47.210> is

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:47.360 
showed and I guess one of the reason is

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:49.690 
showed and I guess one of the reason is
they<00:07:47.720> just<00:07:47.930> didn't<00:07:48.260> even<00:07:48.530> cut<00:07:48.950> all<00:07:49.220> along<00:07:49.490> the

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:49.700 
they just didn't even cut all along the

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:51.760 
they just didn't even cut all along the
top<00:07:49.730> and<00:07:50.270> it<00:07:50.480> served<00:07:50.780> no<00:07:50.870> purpose<00:07:50.960> because

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:51.770 
top and it served no purpose because

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:53.890 
top and it served no purpose because
they<00:07:51.950> looked<00:07:52.190> pretty<00:07:52.250> good<00:07:52.700> beforehand<00:07:53.690> there

00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:53.900 
they looked pretty good beforehand there

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:55.110 
they looked pretty good beforehand there
was<00:07:54.020> nothing<00:07:54.290> wrong<00:07:54.440> with<00:07:54.650> the<00:07:54.770> way<00:07:54.890> they<00:07:55.070> were

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:55.120 
was nothing wrong with the way they were

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.910 
was nothing wrong with the way they were
had<00:07:56.120> they<00:07:56.300> staggered<00:07:56.840> those<00:07:57.050> cuts<00:07:57.440> then<00:07:57.890> I

00:07:57.910 --> 00:07:57.920 
had they staggered those cuts then I

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.740 
had they staggered those cuts then I
would<00:07:58.190> have<00:07:58.250> known<00:07:58.490> they<00:07:58.730> were<00:07:58.790> in<00:07:58.970> in<00:07:59.540> the

00:07:59.740 --> 00:07:59.750 
would have known they were in in the

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:06.160 
would have known they were in in the
process<00:08:00.290> of<00:08:00.470> renovating<00:08:01.480> their<00:08:03.160> Nandina
