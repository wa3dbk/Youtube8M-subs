00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.780
 microsoft sinks bugs in the galley with your 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.660
 My talent here is beautiful because it is 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.620
 because at the time I want it to be like this 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.770
 but the goalkeeper 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:52.320
 today's galley bug is well photobooth of 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:53.370
 Today's bank today is is how to make fire 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.399
 under water 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.289
 yes it's a very easy blog people are 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.750
 A little useless but I think it's cool to 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.920
 you be aware of when changing your 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.719
 friend, I do not know 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.280
 do what you want but beauty 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.049
 First, let me not go in here. 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.450
 world 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:13.049
 It's more or less done because I'm life. 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:18.630
 Crazy to test but beauty is to increase 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:23.150
 So it's far away from there because I do not 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.890
 I want to be kind of close to the thing, huh? 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:29.820
 liked on the floor the son looks only to 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.530
 to light the galley to illuminate amnesty 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.229
 must have seen more or less how 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.350
 is right guys then you will need 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:41.369
 you will need one of a granddaughter and 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.170
 rec rec the lighter is obvious and ice 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.320
 which is impossible to achieve will hear 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.180
 a block but the ice kind of 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.369
 Ice is just to stay even those 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:55.590
 digitale galera than the ice on top of 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:57.930
 hatch and stay that way but it's okay 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.460
 then you will make you first makes a 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.079
 I do not know what you can do here. 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.310
 up but I was making a hole 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.040
 more cute, huh? 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.399
 here you do put a block and a spin 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:13.250
 at the moment you need an ice 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:16.760
 block here a block here a block to which 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.950
 and a block here right after you have done 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.740
 that you want to these blocks here and 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.560
 reading is going to break all the first and 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.690
 break all you win from the boxes 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.740
 break and did not work is to be 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.570
 that was beauty 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.420
 then you're going to need 2g 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:35.390
 Ice fighters puts one here another 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.820
 here whenever not from below on the last 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.800
 Galley act under ice stopped 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.890
 to be a mother and father stand again 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.720
 here and wraps up and breaks the 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:46.700
 people do not have to wait, nothing has to 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.640
 break only has to be ice 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.770
 people that do not work as you have seen 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.380
 break and then it breaks and goes my god 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:58.130
 Heaven said now, my God, who is not? 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.900
 giving our lady is giving because I 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.660
 trying to do now is trying to do yes 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:04.640
 now will make ice right I did with 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.350
 a normal block the guys worked out is that 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.770
 only now if with ice it will give 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:14.630
 I made a normal block and gave places 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:16.790
 thus a break-break into ie ii and 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.500
 free break 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:23.269
 done it is breaking here and it is not giving 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:26.630
 water from heaven, let me just see if I can 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:29.769
 do here come go 10Âº f in the team 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:32.980
 I do not know that he's doing okay. 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:39.500
 I do not know it's not giving more beauty 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:42.230
 yes put on the guys but this 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.060
 usually works out okay to work 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:50.950
 I think it has to stay on top not 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:55.100
 I know if it will start to break it will break 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:59.110
 It breaks right the people you 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.110
 can you see catching fire and that's how it goes 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.380
 break-breaking guys now worked out 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.910
 how to look like it will work this 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.220
 can not be a hole in the ground has to 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:10.459
 be so normal you go there and lay 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.959
 fire and fire under the galley and then 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.400
 for some time this game will repeat itself if 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:16.340
 You break the ice 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.810
 the fire goes off but you break the ice 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.870
 to melt with the game we're going to stay 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:23.419
 So you think it's going to be like this? 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.250
 Fire and can come in you will not take 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:26.500
 damage and gets 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.900
 well cool same line as the effect you 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.240
 certainly with blue effect with 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.100
 white one red looks pretty cute 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.110
 so it's a shower to do here again 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:37.690
 now make with blocks more vocal ice 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.660
 here for you to see that it works out with 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:42.160
 normal blocks of the kind I just think 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.960
 that even here I need to direct it to 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.030
 already gave as you can see but what 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.920
 I realize that it will 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:50.050
 you can see I put broken jadel 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:53.770
 People are here now, just wait for the 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:56.440
 expiration this block that dp and ready nÃ© 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.080
 and it looks so cute a little fire 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.700
 on the seabed 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.290
 cyborg is not very useful but can be 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.550
 A cool little save that way 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.169
 general knowledge 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.910
