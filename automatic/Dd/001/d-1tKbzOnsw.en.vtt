00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 cdu csu part of the fans i hate 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.839
 you warmly welcome to the forecast 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.990
 between bavaria munich and the 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.690
 hamburger sv bavaria munich has one 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.960
 quite a good win series already in this 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.570
 season no defeat two 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:21.060
 draw the rest of victory and everything 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.680
 Now the big question is that against 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:27.210
 the hsv continue to work this way 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.340
 We will see that on the game day 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.250
 Today and I show you the game 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.120
 Just like it might be 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.430
 could go out 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.370
 I played here at Munich because 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.739
 the forecast with fifa and everything from 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.140
 computer-controlled little sl like 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.309
 I only had 00 games the whole time 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.390
 I found that a bit boring 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.129
 That's why I have this in my own hands 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.010
 took the club played 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.649
 namely Bayern Munich from the me 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:56.100
 just think that this club as 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.780
 winner will leave the field and see here 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.789
 you already have the line up mario idiot im 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.829
 Storm Thomas Müller on the right tiago and 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.960
 toni kroos offensive midfield ribéry 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.189
 on the left 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:09.270
 javi martinez in the central defensive 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.590
 midfield alaba and philipp lame up 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.630
 the usual places as well as dante 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.030
 but boateng is not there to have it 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.470
 we are forbidden now 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.790
 that's what i can say to bavaria 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.430
 hsv you see here 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.770
 Of course, not all top players are there 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:27.330
 while there are some little hurt 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:30.000
 or just not dry 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.560
 to 3 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.530
 but yes we are watching the game is one 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.500
 For the first time, the prognosis says the third 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.020
 minute the first goal of mario götze with 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.510
 the head makes the thing in there 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.880
 by philipp lame the flank when I do that 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:50.070
 I saw it very nicely 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.830
 yes, at least that's what I think 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.390
 the bavaria will win against the hsv 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:59.580
 is at least very likely 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:02.399
 it should also happen miracles hsv 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.990
 look over it today and how 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.560
 Of course they can also beat each other 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.390
 that bayern somehow form-deep 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.260
 whatever that day has 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:15.120
 could happen and passau times with three 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.700
 points from the square is now here 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.739
 very important pass on lasogga javi 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.620
 martinez tries to stop it 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:25.709
 which is read but not unstoppable 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.680
 and thus it is 1 1 after 20 minutes 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:31.590
 in the game bavaria against hartz iv on the 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.880
 of course quite interesting but there 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.540
 of course, do not play over here 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.090
 still a lot 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.820
 and that's why maybe it shows you 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.630
 This is the reason for the next highlights 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.730
 again for the bavaria 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.799
 and it goes on a little jump in 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.790
 the 28 minute a small one again 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:48.030
 scene to see 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.830
 Tiago on Mario Götze who fights himself 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.480
 Free outside is received by three 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.049
 in the middle is now here arguments 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.450
 Fallbackzieher but there was a meter 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:03:01.410
 or more then just very nice 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:06.420
 worthwhile scene I find 34 or resp 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:07.680
 35 minute thomas müller sees toni kroos 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.290
 toni kroos tries the ball 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.600
 Control and play the flank in 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.960
 the middle on mario götze for 2 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:19.140
 sometimes he hits his head and it stands 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.940
 2 2 1 in the 36 minute for bavaria 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.740
 Munich 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.380
 So I think that is already here 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.580
 in the direction as it may be in 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:32.520
 reality could rise 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:36.120
 I bet the bet as it is now 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:38.730
 is 21 or maybe a 3 2 1 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.860
 That would be my idea as the game 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.740
 maybe you could go out 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.880
 like your ideas and suggestions 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.600
 relationship tips in the comments 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.880
 write 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.360
 and yes I simply something to tell her 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:53.760
 believes how strong bavaria or strong hsv 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.920
 will play today and how the game 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.300
 actually going out then will see that 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.160
 Of course, we will not do it until the game 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.840
 but i am easy 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.430
 look forward to your comments on your 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.850
 Assessment maybe you have one 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.150
 some suggestions or ideas 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.570
 always 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.160
 what you might see yes that 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:14.010
 must go out so and so no idea 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:17.130
 bayern now has werder bremen 7 0 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:21.420
 that breaks down as a hint that we 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:24.150
 Of course no possibility like so 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.760
 here mario idiot lay out with his 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.220
 third goal in these games 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:32.830
 Patrick had done a wonderful job today 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:35.980
 minute since the ball comes quite a long time 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:40.450
 It can be distributed and nibbled 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:44.680
 drobny 3 to 1 an interesting result 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:46.090
 but what can be increased if 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.850
 we know that this really happens 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.110
 not yet tiago loses there somehow 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:52.120
 The ball still plays in the middle 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.910
 on gods and that takes off but 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:05:00.190
 somehow overheated and put the leather 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:01.840
 somehow yes for the audience so off 

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:06.490
 here again a few substitutions 85 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:09.430
 minute kirchhoff is in now 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.480
 GOTZE again whole shoots well the 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.000
 was weak you might have 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.620
 can present better 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.930
 but that 's the game over it's all about 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.130
 Three to one, I think that's it 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.530
 a realistic result 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.640
 you may like your opinion in the 

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.460
 Write comments 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.690
 and if you also want one 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.580
 thumbs up would give me up 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:30.520
 every event will be glad to hear from you 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.300
 and so I say goodbye and until 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.670
 next time 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.670
 euro from the socceroos is good
