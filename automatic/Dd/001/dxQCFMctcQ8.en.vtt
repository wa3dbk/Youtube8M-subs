00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:19.390
 hello everyone I'm more 1088 welcome to 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:27.369
 my channel today I bring you a request that 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:31.149
 I had a little girl who asked 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:33.250
 advice on what to do when 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:35.410
 example you cut your hair into layers and 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.090
 it turns out that it is worth while at the moment of 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.640
 cut you what is very good but 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.649
 then it turns out that when you're in the 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.290
 head bath and do not comb bad 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:46.570
 present that to the hairs like that the 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.930
 top layer especially you're left with 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.440
 super hair was so good I tried 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.440
 answer 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.860
 but I think I'm going to make a video 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:01.200
 because that way it will look better and if any 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.880
 tomorrow I want to do it and what happens 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.500
 same as better 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.470
 good we begin 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:11.360
 there are two types of scissors basically 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:14.840
 these are normal and it is a fact 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:18.530
 so they cut all the hair that gets 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:21.170
 between the inputs two blades and then 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.180
 we have this kind of scissors that are from 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:28.600
 cull 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.600
 what is a normal sheet 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.880
 crocodile 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:41.110
 then these scissors what he does is 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.110
 cut one strand and another strand 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.930
 well let's do 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:52.740
 I hope you know what it is for 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.900
 the case 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:59.790
 we begin already we are going to take therefore the 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:04.660
 piece of hair the section of hair that 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:06.820
 let's say that the cut is made on 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.860
 problematic voucher where is the cut 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.620
 problematic then we do for 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.110
 example a line was a rectangle in 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.610
 the street a lot the hair forward 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.480
 looking or more or less a rectangle and 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.480
 Brooch doing down here 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.739
 the hair rectangle more or less 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:25.590
 calculating that inside that rectangle 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:29.930
 is the layer that is that 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.930
 we have problems, we comb it all 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.620
 here 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:39.540
 and we upload it all up 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:42.030
 I do not know if he's going to get to see it but 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:46.800
 do what 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:49.110
 then you can catch this is what 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.660
 I do and as I do and there will be my 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.990
 ways to do it but you are for me the 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.990
 more fraternal 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:02.550
 we put on the coat the hair that we have 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.590
 problems that not that it is more then we take 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.510
 it's better but to disarm we would have to 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.760
 be more franchise but in the end the 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.890
 crafty if you have such a problem for sure 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.770
 that promise but it's worth it 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.570
 we take a long and now we put 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:19.420
 without fear is worth it because that is going to do it 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:25.020
 nothing is going to happen , look at me, I have everything 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:25.020
 touches Latin was in all the whole 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.950
 then there will fall once 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:39.120
 thick hair 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:42.300
 surely that with a cut does not go with 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.440
 with a single cut the part then yes 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.660
 we want to make more than one cut because 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:49.390
 they want to degrade more so what 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:52.780
 we make the first cut 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:55.920
 We combed lowered combed and let go 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.920
 those that local 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:02.800
 and we put back to eating barely and in 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.080
 a different measure towards the other side 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.660
 in another part of that new hair then 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.510
 we make another red wind we return to 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.360
 comb 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:15.390
 and if we want to be thinner 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:17.430
 we make another third and yes yes 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:20.980
 because more than three cuts I do not think that 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:24.650
 it's convenient we let go 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:28.060
 and we see how we have left the hair gal 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.060
 if it has already been degraded, it is worth 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.930
 but look, there's not much left of us 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.780
 even if we do that because also 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.879
 there is another way to do it for example 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:40.599
 we can take all that is to divide the 

00:04:37.879 --> 00:04:40.599
 hair in half 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:49.159
 and throw to the side 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.050
 this is very complicated directÃ­simo but 

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:53.449
 true that only a 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:56.419
 little bit more and now for example the 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:58.280
 that you find the lock more you can 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:02.120
 catch fly scissors class class 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:04.580
 three times in different places and what 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.120
 let's comb and the hair is the tip 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.120
 from Granada 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.160
 Well I hope you have understood is 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.340
 super a party because it is that it does not 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.290
 missing the wig 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.870
 that does not skip anymore simply upload 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.000
 top cut in two or three places 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.500
 different 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.960
 if you have the thinnest hair scarcer 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.790
 for only one or only two is worth 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.290
 in different places we have never been 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:29.910
 because if we import in the same place 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.139
 what we are going to do is cut more 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.660
 amount of hair then we will 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:36.360
 be a mimic for kids then 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.740
 we have to do it for example if 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.650
 we have the plan zacchino then to that 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:42.870
 height and he left and already combs and stays 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:45.310
 everything is more degraded and everything is more 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:47.830
 licit is worth more down 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.390
 it will create the volume so much else 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:52.180
 is the lateral volume that you have 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:54.040
 because for example how can also 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.800
 be my case that we have a little hair 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:59.050
 porous and we get crazy head 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.270
 but that's another story like that no no 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:02.650
 has nothing to do with the cut made 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.410
 these people that for example at 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:07.690
 make the cut have here as a 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:10.060
 action step and to lower it or here or 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:13.080
 here where I have been the layer and they create him 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.080
 for a message nothing 

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:19.659
 mushroom is worth then that is done for 

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:22.769
 degrade that fact a little more in that 

00:06:19.659 --> 00:06:24.950
 amount of hair and thus create more 

00:06:22.769 --> 00:06:27.580
 movements 

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:29.680
 for me for my taste 

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:31.750
 Well, I do not want you to have understood 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:35.320
 well what 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:36.760
 that nothing that the others were putting of 

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.790
 down here below what you think of 

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:43.240
 done if you want and if you have done it if 

00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:46.110
 it's something that is and nothing that I want to burn 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.110
 the next video is worth
