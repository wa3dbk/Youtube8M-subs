00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:06.930

 selfish showing the second request 

00:00:10.439 --> 00:00:12.589
 I realized that you do not expect as a salary 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:15.150
 try to be more applications the ones that stay 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.550
 the nintendo knowing that ran what the post-workout 16 years 

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:22.169

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:31.710

 the transition effect will be removed 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.540
 he changes 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.900
 that default scroll 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.660
 of each page 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.660
 remembering that only for 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.060

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.040

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.900
