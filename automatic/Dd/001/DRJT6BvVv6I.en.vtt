let's<00:00:41.280> look<00:00:41.430> at<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.670> levers<00:00:42.030> I<00:00:42.239> try<00:00:42.960> and

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
let's look at the levers I try and

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.510 
let's look at the levers I try and
generally<00:00:43.320> use<00:00:43.469> either<00:00:43.590> one<00:00:43.800> or<00:00:43.860> two<00:00:44.129> fingers

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520

generally use either one or two fingers
on<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.730> levers<00:00:45.090> this<00:00:45.690> gives<00:00:45.930> me<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.079> ability

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
on the levers this gives me the ability

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.139 
on the levers this gives me the ability
to<00:00:46.649> be<00:00:46.739> able<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:47.010> hold<00:00:47.160> on<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.520> motorcycle
