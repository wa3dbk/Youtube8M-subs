00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.940
 when you go listen we go very 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.730
 good for us since this chain is 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.250
 a chain to two so in the company of 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.830

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.389
 audacity this is me I am the enemy red 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.139
 star and we embarked on a new 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.520
 character 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.439
 she lives like you'll see that in 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.689
 the next videos so here we are 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.240
 a a chain a new chain so 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.460
 we are motivated we said oh that's it 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.390
 made since july against douch admits 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.949
 it's not much compared to 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.289
 others but I think we can when 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.640
 even make beautiful videos on not bad 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.430
 of subjects she stops doing sports 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.510
 the aero well here is on this chain 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.300
 what can you find I 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.390
 think of everything we are I am the leader 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.460
 the assault guild PvP coliseum 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.010
 so basically on the brain 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.090
 computer with orsat right arm 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.390

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:56.820
 moment a thank you thank you to 90 so here 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:58.469
 in the pact alliance 2nd no in 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.270
 the alliance of hippies feels that pact 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.949
 is the best alliance so it's a 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.229
 little we worst enemy so we're all the 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.700
 time we fight against them it's his 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.030
 lea family will even if we we 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.650
 level 130 the bear at 136 and celebrate it at 51 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.930
 but hey we have fun and you 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.310
 can see it at christmas we have a pretty 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.070
 good PvE is estimated that the 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.840
 small so she lives before it's a fact 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.950
 at level 20 which was low pvp so at 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.380
 that level there were still some 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.810
 guys who play and so we managed to 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.729
 to get down to grade 4 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.610
 so very hot we went up grade 4 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.710
 after fire grade we went back down 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.840
 but it happens and here is a lot 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.840
 on the other hand, we're doing better 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.119

 good me I'm out of sahin hossam daring 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:25.010
 who started the vp level 35 years old is 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.750
 by that time I went up to 4.3 after I 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.840
 am said ah hold level meaning he the 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.440
 recognize his evidence not badly I'm 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.430
 laughs 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.800
 after I have a little dream on 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.540
 parceum that really pays a lot 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.340
 of indications of money explains 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.800
 knowing that with the new update 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:43.280
 the twelfth becomes more interesting than 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:46.250
 x 3 so it's like in ten fights 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.480
 just about fighting for twain nine for 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.180
 me because I'm the lowest 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.070
 level we get 500 miles so that's it 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.959

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.160

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.110
 that this camp you throw him to you are you 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.989
 all alone it's true that it's a bit 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.840
 more complicated anyway but there you go 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:04.310

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.250
