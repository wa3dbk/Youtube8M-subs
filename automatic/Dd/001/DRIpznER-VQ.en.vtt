00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
new programs for next year I would say

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.680 
new programs for next year I would say
it's<00:00:54.840> taken<00:00:55.410> me<00:00:55.559> maybe<00:00:56.520> 15<00:00:57.030> years<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.539> become

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
it's taken me maybe 15 years to become

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.240 
it's taken me maybe 15 years to become
an<00:00:58.140> artist<00:00:58.469> that's<00:00:58.590> really<00:00:58.829> engage<00:00:59.070> with<00:00:59.100> the

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
an artist that's really engage with the

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.200 
an artist that's really engage with the
public<00:00:59.670> I<00:00:59.820> would<00:00:59.940> say<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.359> first<00:01:00.539> 15<00:01:00.989> years

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
public I would say the first 15 years

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.939 
public I would say the first 15 years
were<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.239> very<00:01:03.510> selfish<00:01:03.960> practice<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:04.890> don't

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
were a very selfish practice and I don't

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.890 
were a very selfish practice and I don't
mean<00:01:05.159> that<00:01:05.220> in<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.610> negative<00:01:05.760> way<00:01:06.150> but<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.780> know

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
mean that in a negative way but you know

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.899 
mean that in a negative way but you know
artists<00:01:07.320> are<00:01:07.409> still<00:01:07.650> trained<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.400> work<00:01:08.580> alone

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
artists are still trained to work alone

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.240 
artists are still trained to work alone
to<00:01:09.420> work<00:01:09.570> by<00:01:09.720> themselves<00:01:09.869> so<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:10.740> think<00:01:11.040> the

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
to work by themselves so I think the

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.310 
to work by themselves so I think the
first<00:01:11.430> step<00:01:11.760> of<00:01:11.790> working<00:01:12.420> in<00:01:12.810> an<00:01:13.020> engaged

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
first step of working in an engaged

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.870 
first step of working in an engaged
practice<00:01:13.680> which<00:01:13.830> is<00:01:13.950> simply<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.340> learn<00:01:14.700> how<00:01:14.850> to

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
practice which is simply to learn how to

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.719 
practice which is simply to learn how to
work<00:01:15.119> not<00:01:15.509> alone<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.470> an<00:01:17.220> exhibition<00:01:17.700> space

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
work not alone and an exhibition space

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.450 
work not alone and an exhibition space
is<00:01:18.119> designed<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.780> receive<00:01:19.140> objects<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:19.920> and

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
is designed to receive objects and and

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.999 
is designed to receive objects and and
in<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.390> way<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.720> separates<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.290> transaction<00:01:22.920> of

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
in a way it separates the transaction of

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.320 
in a way it separates the transaction of
the<00:01:23.130> artist<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:23.700> think<00:01:23.880> oh<00:01:24.060> I'm<00:01:24.210> making

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
the artist and I think oh I'm making

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.300 
the artist and I think oh I'm making
things<00:01:24.689> for<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.900> exhibition<00:01:25.080> space<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:26.159> I

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
things for the exhibition space and I

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.890 
things for the exhibition space and I
think<00:01:26.610> because<00:01:26.909> my<00:01:26.939> work<00:01:27.210> used<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.479> deal<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.720> lot

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
think because my work used to deal a lot

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.370 
think because my work used to deal a lot
with<00:01:27.960> history<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.560> started<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:28.950> get<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.130> lot<00:01:29.549> of

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
with history I started to get a lot of

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.780 
with history I started to get a lot of
requests<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.500> make<00:01:31.710> work<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:31.950> were<00:01:32.159> specific

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
requests to make work that were specific

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.420 
requests to make work that were specific
to<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:32.970> site<00:01:33.360> specific<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.259> history<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.220> a

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
to a site specific to a history and a

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.429 
to a site specific to a history and a
lot<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.729> work<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.299> was<00:01:36.659> in<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.079> public

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
lot of work that was in the public

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.530 
lot of work that was in the public
sphere<00:01:38.000> immediately<00:01:39.000> when<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.240> leave<00:01:39.390> the

exhibition<00:01:39.990> space<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.350> situation<00:01:40.740> gets<00:01:40.890> much

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
exhibition space the situation gets much

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.770 
exhibition space the situation gets much
more<00:01:41.369> complex<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:41.939> richer<00:01:42.360> than<00:01:42.630> you

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
more complex and richer than you

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.929 
more complex and richer than you
inevitably<00:01:43.710> have<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.250> think<00:01:44.520> about<00:01:44.670> the

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
inevitably have to think about the

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.700 
inevitably have to think about the

think<00:01:54.440> that<00:01:54.560> people<00:01:55.100> forget<00:01:55.580> that<00:01:55.790> a<00:01:56.000> museum

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
think that people forget that a museum

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.090 
think that people forget that a museum
is<00:01:56.540> not<00:01:56.690> just<00:01:56.900> a<00:01:56.990> place<00:01:57.140> of<00:01:57.170> consumption<00:01:57.740> where

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.100 
is not just a place of consumption where

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.890 
is not just a place of consumption where
you<00:01:58.160> come<00:01:58.310> and<00:01:58.400> look<00:01:58.610> at<00:01:58.820> art<00:01:59.030> or<00:01:59.270> consume<00:01:59.690> art

00:01:59.890 --> 00:01:59.900 
you come and look at art or consume art

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:00.910 
you come and look at art or consume art
but<00:02:00.110> it<00:02:00.230> could<00:02:00.350> also<00:02:00.470> be<00:02:00.590> a<00:02:00.680> place<00:02:00.890> of

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 
but it could also be a place of

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.400 
but it could also be a place of
production<00:02:01.700> because<00:02:02.510> once<00:02:02.720> you<00:02:02.840> make<00:02:03.110> art

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410 
production because once you make art

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.740 
production because once you make art
youyou<00:02:04.010> look<00:02:04.190> at<00:02:04.370> it<00:02:04.490> and<00:02:04.640> this<00:02:05.090> object<00:02:05.360> and

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
youyou look at it and this object and

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:06.940 
youyou look at it and this object and
you<00:02:05.840> realize<00:02:06.170> that<00:02:06.200> there's<00:02:06.440> another<00:02:06.680> person

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
you realize that there's another person

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.580 
you realize that there's another person
just<00:02:07.400> like<00:02:07.610> you<00:02:07.880> on<00:02:08.119> the<00:02:08.570> other<00:02:08.750> side<00:02:09.110> making

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
just like you on the other side making

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.430 
just like you on the other side making
that<00:02:09.950> thing<00:02:10.190> and<00:02:10.510> that<00:02:11.510> is<00:02:11.630> an<00:02:11.780> incredible

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
that thing and that is an incredible

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:20.380 
that thing and that is an incredible
feeling<00:02:12.650> of<00:02:12.890> connection<00:02:18.550> fair<00:02:19.550> bit<00:02:19.730> of<00:02:19.760> what

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
feeling of connection fair bit of what

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.980 
feeling of connection fair bit of what
we<00:02:20.480> do<00:02:20.630> is<00:02:20.750> to<00:02:20.930> make<00:02:21.520> complicated<00:02:22.520> data

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
we do is to make complicated data

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.960 
we do is to make complicated data
accessible<00:02:23.990> right<00:02:24.470> it<00:02:24.620> may<00:02:24.740> be<00:02:24.800> hard<00:02:25.220> for<00:02:25.850> you

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
accessible right it may be hard for you

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.570 
accessible right it may be hard for you
to<00:02:26.000> encounter<00:02:26.630> these<00:02:26.959> data<00:02:27.230> on<00:02:27.440> your<00:02:27.560> own<00:02:27.739> but

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
to encounter these data on your own but

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:29.920 
to encounter these data on your own but
maybe<00:02:28.850> through<00:02:29.209> some<00:02:29.239> of<00:02:29.480> the<00:02:29.570> displays<00:02:29.840> that

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
maybe through some of the displays that

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.979 
maybe through some of the displays that
we've<00:02:30.170> created<00:02:30.410> we<00:02:30.800> provide<00:02:31.459> a<00:02:31.489> kind<00:02:31.880> of<00:02:32.060> human

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
we've created we provide a kind of human

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.050 
we've created we provide a kind of human
scale<00:02:33.320> to<00:02:33.560> encounter<00:02:33.800> with<00:02:34.190> it<00:02:34.370> so<00:02:34.850> that<00:02:34.910> you

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
scale to encounter with it so that you

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.140 
scale to encounter with it so that you
can<00:02:35.450> come<00:02:36.050> to<00:02:36.200> your<00:02:36.290> own<00:02:36.410> conclusions<00:02:37.040> and<00:02:37.520> the

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
can come to your own conclusions and the

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.690 
can come to your own conclusions and the
data<00:02:38.630> that<00:02:38.900> tends<00:02:39.170> to<00:02:39.290> appeal<00:02:39.890> to<00:02:39.920> all<00:02:40.250> three

of us most is data that is inherently

of us most is data that is inherently

like place that the public has never

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.810 
like place that the public has never
been<00:02:59.989> able<00:03:00.170> to<00:03:00.320> see<00:03:00.620> you<00:03:00.890> know<00:03:01.040> so<00:03:01.370> how<00:03:01.670> do<00:03:01.730> we

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
been able to see you know so how do we

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.970 
been able to see you know so how do we
bring<00:03:02.120> people<00:03:02.180> into<00:03:02.959> that<00:03:03.049> experience<00:03:03.769> is

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
bring people into that experience is

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:04.930 
bring people into that experience is
something<00:03:04.190> that's<00:03:04.489> been<00:03:04.670> really<00:03:04.820> interesting

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
something that's been really interesting

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.080 
something that's been really interesting
for<00:03:05.480> us<00:03:05.510> to<00:03:05.630> to<00:03:06.440> think<00:03:06.680> and<00:03:07.430> talk<00:03:07.730> about

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
for us to to think and talk about

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.610 
for us to to think and talk about
there's<00:03:08.630> a<00:03:08.720> beautiful<00:03:09.019> story<00:03:09.230> to<00:03:09.380> be<00:03:09.470> told

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
there's a beautiful story to be told

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.400 
there's a beautiful story to be told
about<00:03:09.830> how<00:03:10.310> MoMA<00:03:11.000> thinks<00:03:11.360> about<00:03:11.570> its<00:03:11.780> objects

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
about how MoMA thinks about its objects

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.800 
about how MoMA thinks about its objects
and<00:03:12.680> that<00:03:13.489> thinking<00:03:13.850> is<00:03:14.000> maybe<00:03:14.239> captured

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
and that thinking is maybe captured

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:15.789 
and that thinking is maybe captured
through<00:03:14.989> the<00:03:15.080> data<00:03:15.320> that<00:03:15.410> it's<00:03:15.650> been

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
through the data that it's been

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:17.410 
through the data that it's been
collected<00:03:16.340> right<00:03:16.580> the<00:03:16.730> concerns<00:03:17.180> and

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
collected right the concerns and

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.449 
collected right the concerns and
considerations<00:03:17.620> what<00:03:18.620> I<00:03:18.650> think<00:03:18.890> we're<00:03:19.070> we're

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
considerations what I think we're we're

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.820 
considerations what I think we're we're
interested<00:03:19.940> in<00:03:20.030> is<00:03:20.239> looking<00:03:20.900> at<00:03:21.080> how<00:03:21.769> that

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
interested in is looking at how that

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.030 
interested in is looking at how that
helps<00:03:22.640> us<00:03:22.930> come<00:03:23.930> to<00:03:24.110> better<00:03:24.260> understand<00:03:24.860> the

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
helps us come to better understand the

exciting opportunity to try and figure

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.689 
exciting opportunity to try and figure
out<00:04:35.970> how<00:04:36.539> each<00:04:37.139> of<00:04:37.349> our<00:04:37.710> practices<00:04:38.430> will

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
out how each of our practices will

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:41.779 
out how each of our practices will
translate<00:04:39.180> into<00:04:39.509> this<00:04:39.840> context<00:04:40.680> we<00:04:41.310> recognize
