maybe from me greasing my hair or

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.300 
maybe from me greasing my hair or
whatever<00:02:57.360> and<00:02:57.660> it<00:02:58.140> costs<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:58.560> hair<00:02:58.770> to<00:02:58.920> tango

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
whatever and it costs the hair to tango
