GPS<00:00:35.610> it<00:00:35.790> was<00:00:35.880> absolutely<00:00:36.360> useless<00:00:36.570> now<00:00:37.410> if<00:00:37.800> you

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
GPS it was absolutely useless now if you

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.530 
GPS it was absolutely useless now if you
notice<00:00:38.129> how<00:00:38.250> quick<00:00:38.520> everything<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:39.120> like<00:00:39.360> just

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
notice how quick everything is like just

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.720 
notice how quick everything is like just
the<00:00:39.870> entire<00:00:40.140> smoothness<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.219> system<00:00:41.610> is

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
the entire smoothness of the system is

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.040 
the entire smoothness of the system is
great

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
great

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.290 
great
the<00:00:43.620> cat<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:44.280> most<00:00:44.430> impressive<00:00:44.789> thing<00:00:45.120> was

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
the cat the most impressive thing was

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.190 
the cat the most impressive thing was
the<00:00:45.890> accuracy<00:00:46.890> of<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.129> nav<00:00:47.660> while<00:00:48.660> driving<00:00:49.079> in

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
the accuracy of the nav while driving in

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.360 
the accuracy of the nav while driving in
the<00:00:49.260> heart<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.620> city<00:00:49.860> so<00:00:51.680> before<00:00:52.680> I<00:00:52.710> you

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
the heart of the city so before I you

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.470 
the heart of the city so before I you
know<00:00:53.399> anywhere<00:00:53.879> near<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.180> Gardiner

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
know anywhere near the Gardiner

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.540 
know anywhere near the Gardiner
Expressway<00:00:54.510> or<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.230> lakeshore<00:00:55.550> underpass

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
Expressway or the lakeshore underpass

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.270 
Expressway or the lakeshore underpass
you<00:00:56.940> know<00:00:57.030> it<00:00:57.629> was<00:00:58.020> absolutely<00:00:58.350> useless<00:00:58.530> so<00:00:58.920> if

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
you know it was absolutely useless so if

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.959 
you know it was absolutely useless so if
if<00:01:00.210> we<00:01:00.449> go<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:01.280> like<00:01:02.280> boom<00:01:02.489> it's<00:01:02.670> right<00:01:02.730> there

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
if we go to like boom it's right there

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.759 
if we go to like boom it's right there
so<00:01:03.180> quick<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.690> we're<00:01:04.229> just<00:01:04.379> going<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.559> proceed

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
so quick and we're just going to proceed

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.080 
so quick and we're just going to proceed
it's<00:01:04.920> like<00:01:05.010> great<00:01:05.159> right<00:01:05.339> away<00:01:05.580> it's<00:01:05.729> up<00:01:05.880> there

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
it's like great right away it's up there

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.270 
it's like great right away it's up there
and<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.890> route<00:01:07.890> calculation<00:01:08.040> 1<00:01:08.700> 2<00:01:09.560> 3<00:01:10.560> 3

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
and and route calculation 1 2 3 3

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.679 
and and route calculation 1 2 3 3
seconds<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:11.970> it's<00:01:12.090> done<00:01:12.180> and<00:01:12.570> I'm

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
seconds and it's done and I'm

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.899 
seconds and it's done and I'm
underground<00:01:13.020> right<00:01:13.320> now<00:01:13.470> so<00:01:14.220> if<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:14.640> notice

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
underground right now so if you notice

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.190 
underground right now so if you notice
the<00:01:15.090> actual<00:01:16.080> readout<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.979> of<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:18.479> the

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
the actual readout of the of the of the

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.920 
the actual readout of the of the of the
road<00:01:19.380> path<00:01:19.650> is<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.549> litt<00:01:21.240> looks<00:01:21.450> a<00:01:21.600> little<00:01:21.720> bit

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
road path is a litt looks a little bit

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.719 
road path is a litt looks a little bit
thinner<00:01:22.259> than<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:23.070> one<00:01:23.220> if<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:23.520> have<00:01:23.700> the

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
thinner than the one if you have the

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.789 
thinner than the one if you have the
standard<00:01:24.000> one<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.869> was<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.049> lot<00:01:25.200> like<00:01:25.350> this<00:01:25.500> line

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
standard one it was a lot like this line

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.969 
standard one it was a lot like this line
was<00:01:25.979> actually<00:01:26.130> thicker<00:01:27.080> and<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.500> very<00:01:28.619> jumpy

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
was actually thicker and and very jumpy

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.800 
was actually thicker and and very jumpy
like<00:01:29.250> you'd<00:01:29.430> see<00:01:29.610> the<00:01:29.759> icon<00:01:30.119> going<00:01:30.479> like<00:01:30.630> this

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
like you'd see the icon going like this

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.749 
like you'd see the icon going like this
back<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.380> forth<00:01:31.470> all<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:31.890> time<00:01:32.070> so<00:01:32.610> this

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
back and forth all the time so this

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.380 
back and forth all the time so this
one's<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:33.000> lot<00:01:33.119> smoother<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:34.880> it's<00:01:35.880> bang-on

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
one's a lot smoother and it's bang-on

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.330 
one's a lot smoother and it's bang-on
accurate<00:01:36.869> which<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.170> what<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.470> GPS<00:01:37.890> is<00:01:38.040> supposed

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
accurate which is what a GPS is supposed

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.760 
accurate which is what a GPS is supposed
to<00:01:38.490> do<00:01:38.610> anyway<00:01:38.880> right<00:01:39.150> so<00:01:39.770> everything's

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
to do anyway right so everything's

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.130 
to do anyway right so everything's
smooth<00:01:41.100> everything<00:01:41.430> is<00:01:41.579> quick<00:01:42.140> and

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
smooth everything is quick and

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.219 
smooth everything is quick and
everything<00:01:43.439> works<00:01:43.829> now<00:01:44.009> so<00:01:44.340> I'm<00:01:45.270> excited

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
everything works now so I'm excited

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.840 
everything works now so I'm excited
because<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:46.710> have<00:01:46.979> not<00:01:47.159> been<00:01:47.250> able<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.490> use<00:01:47.670> this

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
because I have not been able to use this

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.319 
because I have not been able to use this
GPS<00:01:48.299> with<00:01:48.810> any<00:01:48.960> with<00:01:49.860> any<00:01:49.979> real<00:01:50.189> purpose<00:01:50.399> since

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
GPS with any with any real purpose since

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.420 
GPS with any with any real purpose since
I<00:01:51.420> got<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:51.750> because<00:01:51.899> it<00:01:51.990> was<00:01:52.110> so<00:01:52.320> so<00:01:53.159> inaccurate

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
I got it because it was so so inaccurate

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.709 
I got it because it was so so inaccurate
and<00:01:53.820> so<00:01:54.799> mediocre<00:01:55.799> at<00:01:55.979> best<00:01:56.040> so<00:01:56.640> again<00:01:57.329> product

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
and so mediocre at best so again product
