by<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.160> time<00:01:23.550> we<00:01:23.790> reached<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.180> 29th<00:01:24.900> day

by the time we reached the 29th day
there's<00:01:25.920> still<00:01:26.190> plenty<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.610> room<00:01:26.900> the<00:01:27.900> pond<00:01:28.200> is

there's still plenty of room the pond is
only<00:01:28.620> half<00:01:28.920> filled<00:01:29.310> with<00:01:29.610> lily<00:01:29.790> pads<00:01:30.170> so<00:01:31.170> maybe

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
only half filled with lily pads so maybe

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.410 
only half filled with lily pads so maybe
we'll<00:01:31.950> make<00:01:32.100> plans<00:01:32.490> to<00:01:32.730> do<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.880> bit<00:01:33.120> of<00:01:33.150> fishing

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
we'll make plans to do a bit of fishing

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.300 
we'll make plans to do a bit of fishing
the<00:01:33.750> next<00:01:34.020> day<00:01:35.720> the<00:01:36.720> only<00:01:36.960> problem<00:01:37.410> is<00:01:37.590> on<00:01:37.920> the

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
the next day the only problem is on the

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.700 
the next day the only problem is on the
next<00:01:38.610> day<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:39.180> pond<00:01:39.480> is<00:01:39.900> full<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.410> lily<00:01:40.620> pads

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
next day the pond is full of lily pads

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.180 
next day the pond is full of lily pads
and<00:01:41.310> will<00:01:41.520> soon<00:01:41.790> become<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.570> choking<00:01:43.470> mass<00:01:43.770> of

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
and will soon become a choking mass of

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.630 
and will soon become a choking mass of
dying<00:01:44.430> vegetation<00:01:45.950> unable<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.160> provide<00:01:47.580> a

dying vegetation unable to provide a

safe<00:01:48.060> haven<00:01:48.270> for<00:01:48.630> wildlife<00:01:52.940> the<00:01:53.940> question<00:01:54.360> we

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
safe haven for wildlife the question we

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.190 
safe haven for wildlife the question we
now<00:01:54.780> have<00:01:55.080> to<00:01:55.230> ask<00:01:55.380> ourselves<00:01:55.710> is<00:01:56.370> simply<00:01:56.730> this

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
now have to ask ourselves is simply this

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.770 
now have to ask ourselves is simply this
as<00:01:58.200> our<00:01:58.470> planet<00:01:59.010> already<00:01:59.250> reached<00:01:59.760> the<00:02:00.210> 29th

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
as our planet already reached the 29th

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.890 
as our planet already reached the 29th
day<00:02:01.140> I<00:02:01.470> think<00:02:02.190> we've<00:02:02.580> done<00:02:02.790> more<00:02:03.060> than<00:02:03.300> reach

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:03.900 
day I think we've done more than reach

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.440 
day I think we've done more than reach
the<00:02:04.200> 29th<00:02:04.710> day<00:02:05.010> I<00:02:05.040> think<00:02:05.220> we<00:02:05.580> are<00:02:05.810> well<00:02:06.810> into<00:02:06.840> it

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
the 29th day I think we are well into it

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.470 
the 29th day I think we are well into it
we're<00:02:09.450> on<00:02:09.570> an<00:02:09.720> accelerating<00:02:10.470> curve<00:02:10.860> of<00:02:11.070> change

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
we're on an accelerating curve of change

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.390 
we're on an accelerating curve of change
it's<00:02:12.480> always<00:02:12.660> hard<00:02:13.020> with<00:02:13.320> climate<00:02:13.800> change<00:02:14.040> to

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
it's always hard with climate change to

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.610 
it's always hard with climate change to
know<00:02:14.550> exactly<00:02:15.060> where<00:02:15.540> you<00:02:15.690> are<00:02:15.720> and<00:02:16.200> when<00:02:16.470> the

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
know exactly where you are and when the

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.460 
know exactly where you are and when the
