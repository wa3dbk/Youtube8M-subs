00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:09.880 
all right hello everyone and welcome

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.930 
all right hello everyone and welcome
back<00:00:10.389> to<00:00:10.570> another<00:00:10.930> video<00:00:11.139> and<00:00:11.700> in<00:00:12.700> this<00:00:12.790> video

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:12.940 
back to another video and in this video

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.820 
back to another video and in this video
I'm<00:00:13.360> going<00:00:13.570> to<00:00:13.660> be<00:00:13.750> showcasing<00:00:13.990> a<00:00:14.530> couple<00:00:14.769> of

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:14.830 
I'm going to be showcasing a couple of

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.929 
I'm going to be showcasing a couple of
months<00:00:15.119> the<00:00:16.119> first<00:00:16.360> one<00:00:16.599> being<00:00:16.869> the<00:00:17.939> gravity

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:18.939 
months the first one being the gravity

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:22.380 
months the first one being the gravity
science<00:00:19.390> model<00:00:19.660> so<00:00:20.250> as<00:00:21.250> you<00:00:21.340> can<00:00:21.550> see<00:00:21.759> we<00:00:22.360> have

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:22.390 
science model so as you can see we have

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.249 
science model so as you can see we have
here<00:00:22.960> what<00:00:23.890> is<00:00:24.009> called<00:00:24.279> a<00:00:24.520> gravitate<00:00:25.450> ER<00:00:25.480> and

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:26.259 
here what is called a gravitate ER and

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:28.319 
here what is called a gravitate ER and
if<00:00:26.649> we<00:00:26.800> come<00:00:26.950> over<00:00:27.040> here<00:00:27.189> and<00:00:27.610> we<00:00:28.029> flip<00:00:28.239> this

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:28.329 
if we come over here and we flip this

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:31.830 
if we come over here and we flip this
lever<00:00:28.509> oh<00:00:30.000> my<00:00:31.000> god<00:00:31.180> everything<00:00:31.570> starts

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840 
lever oh my god everything starts

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:43.229 
lever oh my god everything starts
flooding<00:00:34.110> pretty<00:00:35.309> awesome<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:41.940> now<00:00:42.940> there's

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:43.239 
flooding pretty awesome and now there's

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:46.770 
flooding pretty awesome and now there's
a<00:00:43.629> bunch<00:00:43.960> of<00:00:44.079> mushrooms<00:00:44.260> in<00:00:44.859> the<00:00:45.070> air<00:00:45.250> that<00:00:45.780> are

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
a bunch of mushrooms in the air that are

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.990 
a bunch of mushrooms in the air that are
floating<00:00:46.989> all<00:00:47.320> over<00:00:47.350> the<00:00:47.739> place<00:00:47.980> and<00:00:48.309> put<00:00:48.850> this

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
floating all over the place and put this

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.479 
floating all over the place and put this
off<00:00:50.129> everything<00:00:51.129> falls<00:00:51.460> down<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:53.339> I<00:00:54.339> know

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
off everything falls down and I know

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:57.569 
off everything falls down and I know
you're<00:00:54.699> probably<00:00:54.789> wondering<00:00:55.390> uh<00:00:56.579> what

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
you're probably wondering uh what

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:58.829 
you're probably wondering uh what
happens<00:00:57.940> when<00:00:58.030> you<00:00:58.149> get<00:00:58.269> up<00:00:58.359> in<00:00:58.480> the<00:00:58.600> air<00:00:58.629> you

00:00:58.829 --> 00:00:58.839 
happens when you get up in the air you

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:00.869 
happens when you get up in the air you
can't<00:00:59.109> get<00:00:59.230> down<00:00:59.379> well<00:01:00.339> there<00:01:00.670> are<00:01:00.699> these

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
can't get down well there are these

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.340 
can't get down well there are these
things<00:01:00.940> called<00:01:02.850> gravity<00:01:03.850> boots<00:01:03.969> which<00:01:04.839> enable

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
things called gravity boots which enable

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.330 
things called gravity boots which enable
you<00:01:05.560> to<00:01:06.510> put<00:01:07.510> these<00:01:07.659> on<00:01:07.870> and<00:01:08.110> when<00:01:08.950> you<00:01:09.040> flip<00:01:09.220> on

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
you to put these on and when you flip on

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.819 
you to put these on and when you flip on
it<00:01:09.490> flip<00:01:09.729> it<00:01:09.759> on<00:01:10.140> you<00:01:11.140> won't<00:01:11.350> be<00:01:11.470> floating

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:11.829 
it flip it on you won't be floating

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:15.420 
it flip it on you won't be floating
anymore<00:01:12.159> which<00:01:12.700> is<00:01:13.439> amazing<00:01:14.439> and<00:01:14.920> really<00:01:15.070> nice

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
anymore which is amazing and really nice

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.499 
anymore which is amazing and really nice
so<00:01:16.119> that<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:17.380> can<00:01:17.560> stay<00:01:17.740> on<00:01:17.829> the<00:01:17.950> ground<00:01:18.159> while

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
so that you can stay on the ground while

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.639 
so that you can stay on the ground while
other<00:01:19.509> things<00:01:19.750> float<00:01:19.960> in<00:01:20.140> the<00:01:20.229> air<00:01:21.180> okay<00:01:22.180> so

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:22.649 
other things float in the air okay so

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:28.289 
other things float in the air okay so
here<00:01:23.790> we<00:01:24.790> have<00:01:24.820> a<00:01:26.399> directional<00:01:27.399> attractor

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:28.299 
here we have a directional attractor

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:30.060 
here we have a directional attractor
which<00:01:28.509> means<00:01:29.290> it's<00:01:29.469> basically<00:01:29.770> anything

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
which means it's basically anything

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.770 
which means it's basically anything
that's<00:01:30.189> over<00:01:30.820> here<00:01:31.290> when<00:01:32.290> I<00:01:32.530> flip<00:01:32.770> this<00:01:32.890> lever

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
that's over here when I flip this lever

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.859 
that's over here when I flip this lever
will<00:01:34.780> obviously<00:01:35.140> be<00:01:35.380> attracted<00:01:36.100> to<00:01:36.280> it<00:01:36.719> as<00:01:37.719> you

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
will obviously be attracted to it as you

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:45.000 
will obviously be attracted to it as you
can<00:01:37.990> see<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:40.289> long<00:01:41.289> as<00:01:41.770> you<00:01:42.340> can<00:01:42.490> see<00:01:42.700> come<00:01:43.329> on

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
can see the long as you can see come on

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.370 
can see the long as you can see come on
as<00:01:45.670> soon<00:01:45.850> as<00:01:45.910> I<00:01:46.030> flip<00:01:46.210> the<00:01:46.300> library<00:01:46.600> they<00:01:46.960> get

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
as soon as I flip the library they get

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.240 
as soon as I flip the library they get
sucked<00:01:47.770> over<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:49.420> this<00:01:49.780> and<00:01:50.320> you<00:01:50.620> can<00:01:50.680> see

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
sucked over the this and you can see

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.610 
sucked over the this and you can see
that<00:01:51.280> it's<00:01:51.580> all<00:01:51.970> lit<00:01:52.270> up<00:01:52.300> such<00:01:53.230> you<00:01:53.350> know<00:01:53.470> that

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:53.620 
that it's all lit up such you know that

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.710 
that it's all lit up such you know that
song<00:01:53.800> and<00:01:54.400> the<00:01:54.850> next<00:01:55.000> thing<00:01:55.120> we<00:01:55.270> have<00:01:55.300> is<00:01:55.600> a

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
song and the next thing we have is a

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:02.610 
song and the next thing we have is a
directional<00:02:00.390> pulsar<00:02:01.390> yeah<00:02:02.260> i<00:02:02.290> think<00:02:02.470> it's

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:02.620 
directional pulsar yeah i think it's

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.180 
directional pulsar yeah i think it's
called<00:02:02.680> a<00:02:02.860> pulsar<00:02:03.490> hold<00:02:03.910> on<00:02:04.320> yeah<00:02:05.320> we<00:02:06.070> have<00:02:06.160> a

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
called a pulsar hold on yeah we have a

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.100 
called a pulsar hold on yeah we have a
directional<00:02:06.670> repulsor<00:02:07.240> and<00:02:07.510> that<00:02:07.900> basically

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
directional repulsor and that basically

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.410 
directional repulsor and that basically
just<00:02:08.530> does<00:02:08.710> the<00:02:08.860> opposite<00:02:09.280> it<00:02:09.550> pushes<00:02:10.240> you

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
just does the opposite it pushes you

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.330 
just does the opposite it pushes you
away<00:02:10.570> like<00:02:10.990> that<00:02:11.050> you<00:02:11.380> go<00:02:12.090> there<00:02:13.090> now<00:02:14.250> when<00:02:15.250> you

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
away like that you go there now when you

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.680 
away like that you go there now when you
use<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.150> repulsor<00:02:16.630> it<00:02:16.890> pushes<00:02:17.890> you<00:02:18.040> away

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
use the repulsor it pushes you away

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.830 
use the repulsor it pushes you away
obviously<00:02:19.690> and<00:02:20.280> these<00:02:21.280> are<00:02:21.540> basically<00:02:22.540> ones

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
obviously and these are basically ones

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.060 
obviously and these are basically ones
that<00:02:23.020> aren't<00:02:23.170> directional<00:02:23.560> they<00:02:23.650> just<00:02:23.830> do<00:02:23.950> the

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
that aren't directional they just do the

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.450 
that aren't directional they just do the
same<00:02:24.280> exact<00:02:24.610> thing<00:02:24.820> just<00:02:25.120> in<00:02:25.330> all<00:02:25.900> directions

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
same exact thing just in all directions

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.380 
same exact thing just in all directions
so<00:02:28.800> whenever<00:02:29.800> something<00:02:30.370> works<00:02:30.670> past<00:02:30.970> it<00:02:31.210> they

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
so whenever something works past it they

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:37.020 
so whenever something works past it they
get<00:02:31.570> pushed<00:02:31.900> away<00:02:34.260> okay<00:02:35.260> alright<00:02:36.220> so<00:02:36.520> now<00:02:36.790> this

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
get pushed away okay alright so now this

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.940 
get pushed away okay alright so now this
is<00:02:37.240> basically<00:02:37.720> the<00:02:37.990> same<00:02:38.020> thing<00:02:38.230> as<00:02:38.709> the

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
is basically the same thing as the

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:49.520 
is basically the same thing as the
directional<00:02:41.370> one<00:02:42.370> but<00:02:45.120> it's<00:02:46.120> on<00:02:46.360> both<00:02:46.510> sides

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:56.220 

these<00:02:50.530> on<00:02:52.560> those<00:02:53.560> are<00:02:53.709> really<00:02:53.920> nice<00:02:54.420> so<00:02:55.420> my<00:02:55.989> god

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
these on those are really nice so my god

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.020 
these on those are really nice so my god
you're<00:02:56.440> gonna<00:02:56.530> work<00:02:56.770> stupid<00:02:57.070> curl<00:02:58.620> nah<00:02:59.620> and

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
you're gonna work stupid curl nah and

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:06.060 
you're gonna work stupid curl nah and
this<00:03:01.030> is<00:03:01.300> basically<00:03:02.170> a<00:03:05.070> directional

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
this is basically a directional

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.640 
this is basically a directional
gravitate<00:03:06.640> er<00:03:06.670> which<00:03:07.570> makes<00:03:07.870> if<00:03:08.320> you're<00:03:08.470> in

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
gravitate er which makes if you're in

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.900 
gravitate er which makes if you're in
this<00:03:09.150> direction<00:03:10.470> take<00:03:11.470> scoops<00:03:11.709> up<00:03:11.910> you'll

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
this direction take scoops up you'll

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.780 
this direction take scoops up you'll
start<00:03:13.320> floating<00:03:14.340> except<00:03:15.340> when<00:03:15.489> you<00:03:15.580> come<00:03:15.700> over

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
start floating except when you come over

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.449 
start floating except when you come over
here<00:03:16.260> you're<00:03:17.260> not<00:03:17.380> flow<00:03:17.590> anymore<00:03:18.040> so<00:03:18.280> that's

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
here you're not flow anymore so that's

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:25.979 
here you're not flow anymore so that's
really<00:03:18.820> cool<00:03:19.209> and<00:03:22.019> the<00:03:23.100> second<00:03:24.100> mod<00:03:24.840> that<00:03:25.840> I'm

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989 
really cool and the second mod that I'm

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.890 
really cool and the second mod that I'm
going<00:03:26.230> to<00:03:26.290> be<00:03:26.380> showcasing<00:03:26.890> is<00:03:27.310> the<00:03:27.900> extra

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
going to be showcasing is the extra

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.740 
going to be showcasing is the extra
big-ass<00:03:29.250> villages<00:03:30.250> is<00:03:30.730> what<00:03:31.300> it's<00:03:31.450> called<00:03:31.690> and

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
big-ass villages is what it's called and

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.979 
big-ass villages is what it's called and
the<00:03:34.750> name<00:03:34.900> kind<00:03:35.200> of<00:03:35.260> speaks<00:03:35.500> for<00:03:35.590> itself<00:03:36.989> it

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
the name kind of speaks for itself it

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.910 
the name kind of speaks for itself it
just<00:03:38.290> makes<00:03:38.530> really<00:03:39.400> big<00:03:39.580> colleges<00:03:40.120> and<00:03:40.450> a<00:03:41.110> lot

of them if we come over here there's
another<00:03:45.519> little<00:03:45.700> small<00:03:46.030> one<00:03:46.209> here<00:03:46.239> and<00:03:47.070> then

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
another little small one here and then

another little small one here and then
there's<00:03:48.370> this<00:03:50.190> come<00:03:51.190> on<00:03:51.340> load

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
there's this come on load

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.350 
there's this come on load
this<00:03:54.080> is<00:03:54.260> absolutely<00:03:54.560> gianormous<00:03:55.460> one<00:03:56.060> over

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
this is absolutely gianormous one over

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.420 
this is absolutely gianormous one over
here<00:03:59.110> which<00:04:00.110> is<00:04:00.260> really<00:04:00.500> nice<00:04:00.650> feel<00:04:01.100> like<00:04:01.250> that

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
here which is really nice feel like that

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.370 
here which is really nice feel like that
kind<00:04:01.670> of<00:04:01.730> feel<00:04:01.940> would<00:04:02.240> like<00:04:02.390> the<00:04:02.540> NPC's<00:04:03.080> and

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
kind of feel would like the NPC's and

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:09.270 
kind of feel would like the NPC's and
stuff<00:04:04.450> you<00:04:05.450> should<00:04:05.630> go<00:04:05.750> download<00:04:06.200> this<00:04:06.410> and

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.390 

there<00:04:10.280> was<00:04:10.550> even<00:04:11.030> another<00:04:11.570> one<00:04:11.720> over<00:04:12.140> here<00:04:12.400> if

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:13.400 
there was even another one over here if

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.610 
there was even another one over here if
I<00:04:13.520> can<00:04:13.730> find<00:04:14.240> it<00:04:16.989> yet<00:04:17.989> this<00:04:18.169> one<00:04:18.380> right<00:04:18.560> here

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
I can find it yet this one right here

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.520 
I can find it yet this one right here
too<00:04:19.100> so<00:04:19.880> as<00:04:19.970> you<00:04:20.150> see<00:04:20.299> they<00:04:20.419> just<00:04:20.630> they<00:04:21.230> spawn<00:04:21.500> a

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
too so as you see they just they spawn a

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:28.830 
too so as you see they just they spawn a
halt<00:04:21.829> over<00:04:22.100> the<00:04:22.190> place<00:04:22.370> completely<00:04:23.330> randomly

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.330 

which<00:04:29.840> is<00:04:30.020> really<00:04:30.260> cool<00:04:30.530> it's<00:04:30.950> just<00:04:31.100> a<00:04:31.160> nice
