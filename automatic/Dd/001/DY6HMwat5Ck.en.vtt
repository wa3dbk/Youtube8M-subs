00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
you know I've planted corn about a month

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.640 
you know I've planted corn about a month
ago<00:00:02.970> so<00:00:03.330> I<00:00:03.389> wanted<00:00:03.659> to<00:00:03.720> pull<00:00:03.929> up<00:00:04.110> a<00:00:04.200> couple<00:00:04.380> of

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
ago so I wanted to pull up a couple of

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.460 
ago so I wanted to pull up a couple of
plants<00:00:05.130> and<00:00:05.879> in<00:00:06.120> this<00:00:06.330> video<00:00:06.600> I<00:00:06.779> wanted<00:00:07.319> to

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
plants and in this video I wanted to

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.280 
plants and in this video I wanted to
walk<00:00:08.130> you<00:00:08.160> through<00:00:08.730> the<00:00:08.940> early<00:00:09.690> stages<00:00:09.719> of

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
walk you through the early stages of

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.039 
walk you through the early stages of
root<00:00:10.830> development<00:00:11.179> you<00:00:12.179> know<00:00:12.269> what<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.599> parts

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
root development you know what the parts

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.780 
root development you know what the parts
of<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.290> root<00:00:13.469> system<00:00:13.950> are<00:00:14.130> why<00:00:14.519> they're

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
of the root system are why they're

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.540 
of the root system are why they're
important<00:00:15.360> and<00:00:15.599> had<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:16.350> stage<00:00:16.680> in<00:00:16.920> early<00:00:17.250> corn

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
important and had a stage in early corn

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.160 
important and had a stage in early corn
plant<00:00:17.880> so<00:00:18.270> you<00:00:18.930> know<00:00:19.050> this<00:00:19.230> plant<00:00:19.529> here<00:00:20.100> is

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 
plant so you know this plant here is

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.560 
plant so you know this plant here is
access<00:00:22.170> very<00:00:22.590> healthy<00:00:23.100> specimen<00:00:23.699> for<00:00:24.330> all<00:00:24.449> the

access very healthy specimen for all the
wind<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:24.960> cold<00:00:25.140> we've<00:00:25.410> had<00:00:25.650> this<00:00:26.099> plant<00:00:26.430> looks

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
wind and cold we've had this plant looks

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.040 
wind and cold we've had this plant looks
beautiful<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.480> me<00:00:27.630> but<00:00:28.619> this<00:00:29.010> is<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.160> v2<00:00:30.060> right

beautiful to me but this is a v2 right
that's<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.320> vegetative<00:00:31.980> stage<00:00:32.219> v2<00:00:32.880> corn<00:00:33.239> plant

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:33.559 
that's a vegetative stage v2 corn plant

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:36.229 
that's a vegetative stage v2 corn plant
with<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.590> pretty<00:00:34.800> healthy<00:00:35.040> root<00:00:35.370> system<00:00:35.399> and

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
with a pretty healthy root system and

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.340 
with a pretty healthy root system and
what<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.420> want<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.719> do<00:00:36.809> now<00:00:36.989> is<00:00:37.020> walk<00:00:37.320> you

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
talk about growth stage on corn really

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.940 
talk about growth stage on corn really
what<00:00:42.120> we're<00:00:42.239> looking<00:00:42.270> for<00:00:42.570> particularly<00:00:43.379> you

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
what we're looking for particularly you

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.250 
what we're looking for particularly you
know<00:00:44.040> early<00:00:44.370> in<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.579> season<00:00:44.789> like<00:00:45.090> this<00:00:45.360> are

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
know early in the season like this are

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.619 
know early in the season like this are
these<00:00:46.440> inverted<00:00:46.950> V's<00:00:47.370> at<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:48.000> base<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.270> the

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
these inverted V's at the base of the

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.830 
these inverted V's at the base of the
leaf<00:00:48.840> that's<00:00:49.440> called<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.920> leaf<00:00:50.160> collar<00:00:50.840> and

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
leaf that's called the leaf collar and

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.529 
leaf that's called the leaf collar and
when<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.079> can<00:00:52.410> find<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:53.100> then<00:00:53.910> I<00:00:54.090> can<00:00:54.329> count

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
when I can find that then I can count

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.470 
when I can find that then I can count
that<00:00:54.719> as<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.199> fully<00:00:55.559> developed<00:00:55.980> leaf<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:57.300> here's

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
that as a fully developed leaf so here's

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.240 
that as a fully developed leaf so here's
your<00:00:57.600> first<00:00:57.870> leaf<00:00:58.170> on<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.440> corn<00:00:58.739> plant<00:00:59.010> usually

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
your first leaf on a corn plant usually

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.490 
your first leaf on a corn plant usually
rounded<00:00:59.910> alright<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.420> coleoptile<00:01:00.719> leaf<00:01:01.289> is

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
rounded alright the coleoptile leaf is

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.729 
rounded alright the coleoptile leaf is
rounded<00:01:01.920> so<00:01:02.550> that's<00:01:02.730> v1<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:04.229> then<00:01:04.350> as<00:01:04.439> we<00:01:04.530> come

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
rounded so that's v1 and then as we come

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.859 
rounded so that's v1 and then as we come
around<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:06.210> course<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.479> leaves<00:01:06.689> on<00:01:06.840> a

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
around and of course the leaves on a

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.260 
around and of course the leaves on a
corn<00:01:07.170> plant<00:01:07.320> are<00:01:07.619> staggered<00:01:08.250> up<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.610> plant<00:01:08.909> so

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
corn plant are staggered up the plant so

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.080 
corn plant are staggered up the plant so
here's<00:01:09.479> my<00:01:09.659> second<00:01:10.110> inverted<00:01:10.770> V<00:01:11.010> that<00:01:11.880> makes

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
here's my second inverted V that makes

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.630 
here's my second inverted V that makes
that<00:01:12.299> v2<00:01:13.400> alright

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
that v2 alright

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.810 
that v2 alright
see<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.000> expression<00:01:15.479> in<00:01:15.570> midrib<00:01:16.080> there

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
see the expression in midrib there

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.010 
see the expression in midrib there
beautiful<00:01:17.820> plant<00:01:18.470> now<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.500> cannot<00:01:20.220> find<00:01:21.020> the

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
beautiful plant now I cannot find the

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.719 
beautiful plant now I cannot find the
third<00:01:22.259> collar<00:01:22.530> so<00:01:22.920> I'm<00:01:23.009> not<00:01:23.159> there<00:01:23.430> yet<00:01:23.670> so

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
third collar so I'm not there yet so

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.320 
third collar so I'm not there yet so
this<00:01:24.150> is<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.360> v2<00:01:24.900> planet<00:01:25.380> but<00:01:25.979> certainly<00:01:26.460> you've

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
this is a v2 planet but certainly you've

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.999 
this is a v2 planet but certainly you've
got<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.780> thirdly<00:01:28.049> if<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:28.439> get<00:01:28.560> quite<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:28.829> bit

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
got the thirdly if you get quite a bit

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.350 
got the thirdly if you get quite a bit
of<00:01:29.159> it<00:01:29.250> actually<00:01:29.400> but<00:01:29.790> you're<00:01:29.939> still<00:01:30.060> a<00:01:30.150> couple

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
of it actually but you're still a couple

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.960 
of it actually but you're still a couple
days<00:01:30.630> out<00:01:30.840> before<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:31.890> can<00:01:32.040> call<00:01:32.189> that<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.400> v3

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
days out before you can call that a v3

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.149 
days out before you can call that a v3
so<00:01:33.200> again<00:01:34.200> you're<00:01:34.320> looking<00:01:34.409> for<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.770> inverted

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
so again you're looking for the inverted

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.399 
so again you're looking for the inverted
V<00:01:35.340> 1<00:01:36.229> into<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.770> makes<00:01:37.979> this<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.400> V<00:01:38.700> 2<00:01:38.939> plant

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
V 1 into and that makes this a V 2 plant

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:41.990 
V 1 into and that makes this a V 2 plant
vegetative<00:01:40.409> 2<00:01:40.829> leaves<00:01:41.100> fully<00:01:41.520> developed

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
vegetative 2 leaves fully developed

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.700 
vegetative 2 leaves fully developed
alright<00:01:42.420> now<00:01:42.570> let's<00:01:42.810> get<00:01:42.930> close<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.530> root

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
alright now let's get close to the root

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.109 
alright now let's get close to the root
system<00:01:44.270> I<00:01:46.009> really<00:01:47.009> want<00:01:47.220> my<00:01:47.369> root<00:01:47.579> system<00:01:48.000> when

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
system I really want my root system when

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.760 
system I really want my root system when
I'm<00:01:48.210> digging<00:01:48.509> up<00:01:48.630> some<00:01:48.780> young<00:01:49.020> plants<00:01:49.590> like

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
I'm digging up some young plants like

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.219 
I'm digging up some young plants like
this<00:01:50.009> at<00:01:50.310> v2<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:50.790> want<00:01:51.180> that<00:01:51.360> root<00:01:51.570> system<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:51.990> be

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
this at v2 I want that root system to be

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.310 
this at v2 I want that root system to be
white<00:01:52.700> white<00:01:53.700> is<00:01:53.970> an<00:01:54.149> excellent<00:01:54.570> indication

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
white white is an excellent indication

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.459 
white white is an excellent indication
of<00:01:55.409> health<00:01:55.710> plant<00:01:56.219> health<00:01:56.960> so<00:01:57.960> I've<00:01:58.049> dug<00:01:58.290> this

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
of health plant health so I've dug this

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.810 
of health plant health so I've dug this
up<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.890> of<00:01:58.950> course<00:01:59.159> I've<00:01:59.340> washed<00:01:59.549> all<00:01:59.790> the

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
up and of course I've washed all the

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.060 
up and of course I've washed all the
roots<00:02:00.090> off<00:02:00.299> of<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:00.689> excuse<00:02:01.530> me<00:02:01.649> all<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.920> soil

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
roots off of it excuse me all the soil

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.420 
roots off of it excuse me all the soil
off<00:02:02.340> of<00:02:02.549> it<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:03.890> really<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:04.920> want<00:02:05.189> to<00:02:05.280> see

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
off of it and really I want to see

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.490 
off of it and really I want to see
everything<00:02:05.939> looking<00:02:06.240> white<00:02:06.570> white<00:02:07.079> it<00:02:07.439> means

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
everything looking white white it means

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.660 
everything looking white white it means
health<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:09.590> anytime<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:10.739> find<00:02:10.979> around

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
health and anytime you find around

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.460 
health and anytime you find around
necrotic<00:02:12.209> regions<00:02:12.870> or<00:02:13.319> you

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
necrotic regions or you

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.910 
necrotic regions or you
finding<00:02:14.180> you<00:02:15.180> know<00:02:15.300> brown<00:02:16.050> lesions<00:02:16.710> and

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
finding you know brown lesions and

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.290 
finding you know brown lesions and
things<00:02:17.130> like<00:02:17.310> that<00:02:17.370> you<00:02:17.820> really<00:02:18.060> want<00:02:18.240> to

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
things like that you really want to

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.690 
things like that you really want to
start<00:02:18.480> asking<00:02:18.990> you<00:02:19.290> know<00:02:19.380> what's<00:02:19.650> happening

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
start asking you know what's happening

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.570 
start asking you know what's happening
have<00:02:21.690> I<00:02:21.810> been<00:02:21.990> wet<00:02:22.290> for<00:02:22.320> a<00:02:22.590> long<00:02:22.800> time<00:02:23.190> and

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
have I been wet for a long time and

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.880 
have I been wet for a long time and
maybe<00:02:23.670> I've<00:02:23.850> got<00:02:23.970> some<00:02:24.150> fungus<00:02:24.600> coming<00:02:24.930> in<00:02:25.110> and

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
maybe I've got some fungus coming in and

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.470 
maybe I've got some fungus coming in and
what<00:02:26.130> does<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.400> rest<00:02:26.730> of<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:26.970> plant<00:02:27.210> look

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
what does the rest of the plant look

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.040 
what does the rest of the plant look
like<00:02:27.720> in<00:02:28.260> relation<00:02:28.800> to<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.070> root<00:02:29.250> system<00:02:30.050> you

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
like in relation to the root system you

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.030 
like in relation to the root system you
know<00:02:31.170> those<00:02:31.350> are<00:02:31.500> things<00:02:31.560> you<00:02:31.770> ought<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:31.980> be

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
know those are things you ought to be

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.430 
know those are things you ought to be
looking<00:02:32.310> for<00:02:32.610> thinking<00:02:33.120> about<00:02:33.240> if<00:02:34.110> when<00:02:34.350> you

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
looking for thinking about if when you

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.080 
looking for thinking about if when you
get<00:02:34.530> done<00:02:34.710> washing<00:02:35.190> this<00:02:35.340> off<00:02:35.580> if<00:02:35.790> you<00:02:35.910> don't

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
get done washing this off if you don't

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.790 
get done washing this off if you don't
really<00:02:36.270> have<00:02:36.450> a<00:02:36.510> nice<00:02:36.750> white<00:02:37.050> root<00:02:37.320> system

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
really have a nice white root system

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.640 
really have a nice white root system
okay<00:02:38.550> now<00:02:39.390> you've<00:02:39.630> got<00:02:39.780> your<00:02:39.930> corn<00:02:40.110> kernel<00:02:40.470> of

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
okay now you've got your corn kernel of

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.850 
okay now you've got your corn kernel of
course<00:02:40.980> it's<00:02:41.790> from<00:02:42.150> that<00:02:42.450> very<00:02:42.900> early<00:02:43.170> on<00:02:43.350> you

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
course it's from that very early on you

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.980 
course it's from that very early on you
get<00:02:44.100> a<00:02:44.160> chute<00:02:44.490> that<00:02:44.520> starts<00:02:45.120> to<00:02:45.270> develop<00:02:45.300> and

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
get a chute that starts to develop and

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.900 
get a chute that starts to develop and
it<00:02:46.080> moves<00:02:46.290> towards<00:02:46.800> the<00:02:46.860> soil<00:02:46.980> surface<00:02:47.670> and

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
it moves towards the soil surface and

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.320 
it moves towards the soil surface and
that's<00:02:48.810> a<00:02:48.900> marvel<00:02:49.320> of<00:02:49.440> nature<00:02:49.470> for<00:02:50.070> me<00:02:50.330> you

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
that's a marvel of nature for me you

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.970 
that's a marvel of nature for me you
know<00:02:51.420> you're<00:02:51.600> playing<00:02:51.780> five<00:02:52.140> to<00:02:52.410> ten<00:02:52.620> mile<00:02:52.830> an

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
know you're playing five to ten mile an

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.860 
know you're playing five to ten mile an
hour<00:02:53.100> and<00:02:53.550> that<00:02:53.700> seeds<00:02:53.970> bouncing<00:02:54.510> all<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.780> way

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
hour and that seeds bouncing all the way

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.199 
hour and that seeds bouncing all the way
down<00:02:55.080> through<00:02:55.320> that<00:02:55.500> seed<00:02:55.770> tube<00:02:56.070> and<00:02:57.030> then

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
down through that seed tube and then

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.880 
down through that seed tube and then
when<00:02:57.330> this<00:02:57.450> thing<00:02:57.660> starts<00:02:57.990> to<00:02:58.050> germinate<00:02:58.590> it

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
when this thing starts to germinate it

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.150 
when this thing starts to germinate it
understands<00:02:59.850> its<00:03:00.209> orientation<00:03:01.010> sends<00:03:02.010> that

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
understands its orientation sends that

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.250 
understands its orientation sends that
shoot<00:03:02.430> up<00:03:02.580> towards<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.180> soil<00:03:03.360> surface<00:03:03.660> and

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
shoot up towards the soil surface and

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.680 
shoot up towards the soil surface and
then<00:03:04.800> this<00:03:04.980> first<00:03:05.280> root<00:03:05.580> here<00:03:06.060> coming<00:03:06.660> from

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
then this first root here coming from

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.560 
then this first root here coming from
the<00:03:06.870> bottom<00:03:07.370> of<00:03:08.370> the<00:03:08.520> kernel<00:03:08.850> towards<00:03:09.420> the

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
the bottom of the kernel towards the

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.170 
the bottom of the kernel towards the
ground<00:03:09.780> of<00:03:10.050> course<00:03:10.290> is<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:10.980> radical<00:03:11.370> right

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
ground of course is the radical right

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.620 
ground of course is the radical right
and<00:03:12.420> that<00:03:12.570> radical<00:03:12.750> can<00:03:13.170> get<00:03:13.290> quite<00:03:13.800> long<00:03:14.630> puts

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
and that radical can get quite long puts

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.440 
and that radical can get quite long puts
out<00:03:15.780> some<00:03:15.959> nice<00:03:16.260> fibrous<00:03:17.160> roots<00:03:17.459> but<00:03:18.300> that

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
out some nice fibrous roots but that

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.210 
out some nice fibrous roots but that
radical<00:03:18.930> is<00:03:19.019> critical<00:03:19.500> in<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:19.650> early<00:03:19.950> stages

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
radical is critical in the early stages

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.220 
radical is critical in the early stages
for<00:03:20.430> bringing<00:03:20.940> moisture<00:03:21.330> bringing<00:03:22.110> in

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
for bringing moisture bringing in

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.390 
for bringing moisture bringing in
nutrients<00:03:22.920> a<00:03:23.910> little<00:03:24.540> bit<00:03:24.660> of<00:03:24.780> anchoring<00:03:25.400> but

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
nutrients a little bit of anchoring but

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.130 
nutrients a little bit of anchoring but
really<00:03:26.670> it's<00:03:26.790> all<00:03:26.880> about<00:03:27.150> water<00:03:27.660> absorption

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
really it's all about water absorption

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.960 
really it's all about water absorption
and<00:03:28.470> nutrient<00:03:28.920> uptake<00:03:29.070> to<00:03:29.550> really<00:03:29.790> support

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
and nutrient uptake to really support

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.229 
and nutrient uptake to really support
that<00:03:30.330> young<00:03:30.600> healthy<00:03:31.230> growing<00:03:31.470> plant<00:03:31.860> okay<00:03:32.370> so

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
that young healthy growing plant okay so

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.229 
that young healthy growing plant okay so
the<00:03:33.360> kernel<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:34.010> radical<00:03:35.010> now<00:03:35.610> these<00:03:35.880> roots

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
the kernel the radical now these roots

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.930 
the kernel the radical now these roots
here<00:03:36.600> help<00:03:37.019> with<00:03:37.170> anchoring<00:03:37.620> but<00:03:38.610> really

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
here help with anchoring but really

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.550 
here help with anchoring but really
their<00:03:39.150> primary<00:03:39.570> role<00:03:39.810> there<00:03:40.230> are<00:03:40.350> called

their primary role there are called

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.729 
their primary role there are called
seminal<00:03:41.070> roots<00:03:41.780> really<00:03:42.780> their<00:03:43.080> role<00:03:43.320> is<00:03:43.709> to

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
seminal roots really their role is to

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.880 
seminal roots really their role is to
bring<00:03:44.160> in<00:03:44.400> nutrients<00:03:45.299> and<00:03:45.450> water<00:03:45.600> a<00:03:45.989> little

bring in nutrients and water a little

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:48.770 
bring in nutrients and water a little
bit<00:03:46.980> of<00:03:47.070> anchoring<00:03:47.519> as<00:03:47.760> this<00:03:48.299> plant<00:03:48.600> gets

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
bit of anchoring as this plant gets

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.500 
bit of anchoring as this plant gets
upright<00:03:49.350> and<00:03:49.799> starts<00:03:50.340> to<00:03:50.489> send<00:03:50.700> the<00:03:50.820> chute<00:03:51.060> to

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
upright and starts to send the chute to

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.690 
upright and starts to send the chute to
the<00:03:51.630> soil<00:03:51.900> surface<00:03:52.110> so<00:03:53.010> these<00:03:53.130> are<00:03:53.310> seminal

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
the soil surface so these are seminal

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.009 
the soil surface so these are seminal
roots<00:03:53.910> so<00:03:54.060> you've<00:03:54.180> got<00:03:54.330> your<00:03:54.450> radical<00:03:54.810> and

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
roots so you've got your radical and

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.370 
roots so you've got your radical and
your<00:03:55.140> seminal<00:03:55.560> roots<00:03:55.940> now<00:03:57.200> what's<00:03:58.200> really

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
your seminal roots now what's really

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.070 
your seminal roots now what's really
fascinating<00:03:58.680> then<00:03:59.370> for<00:04:00.030> me<00:04:00.180> is<00:04:00.510> the<00:04:00.870> Meza

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
fascinating then for me is the Meza

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.960 
fascinating then for me is the Meza
caudal<00:04:01.560> that's<00:04:01.799> this<00:04:02.010> region<00:04:02.280> right<00:04:02.610> here

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
caudal that's this region right here

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.630 
caudal that's this region right here
this<00:04:03.750> Vanessa<00:04:04.140> Connell<00:04:04.560> will<00:04:04.739> push<00:04:04.980> up<00:04:05.280> to<00:04:05.519> the

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
this Vanessa Connell will push up to the

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.699 
this Vanessa Connell will push up to the
surface<00:04:05.910> right<00:04:06.750> that's<00:04:07.019> your<00:04:07.140> developing

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
surface right that's your developing

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.009 
surface right that's your developing
sheet<00:04:08.000> pushes<00:04:09.000> up<00:04:09.180> towards<00:04:09.209> the<00:04:09.570> soil<00:04:09.750> surface

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
sheet pushes up towards the soil surface

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:13.250 
sheet pushes up towards the soil surface
now<00:04:10.380> when<00:04:10.530> it<00:04:10.650> starts<00:04:11.010> to<00:04:11.190> sense<00:04:11.519> light<00:04:12.260> it

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
now when it starts to sense light it

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.030 
now when it starts to sense light it
stops<00:04:13.620> and<00:04:14.580> then<00:04:15.030> from<00:04:15.360> that<00:04:15.510> point<00:04:15.780> upward<00:04:16.470> is

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
stops and then from that point upward is

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:20.000 
stops and then from that point upward is
all<00:04:17.400> chute<00:04:17.850> with<00:04:18.180> developing<00:04:18.959> leaves<00:04:19.290> many

all chute with developing leaves many
many<00:04:20.340> leaves<00:04:20.669> can<00:04:21.120> actually<00:04:21.479> be<00:04:21.599> found<00:04:21.870> inside

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
find this region here usually about a

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.089 
find this region here usually about a
half<00:05:21.569> to<00:05:21.840> three<00:05:22.080> quarters<00:05:22.110> of<00:05:22.470> an<00:05:22.680> inch<00:05:22.800> below

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
the soil surface and again that happens

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.249 
the soil surface and again that happens
when<00:05:26.759> this<00:05:26.880> Meza<00:05:27.150> Caudill<00:05:27.539> starts<00:05:27.840> to<00:05:27.990> sense

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:28.259 
when this Meza Caudill starts to sense

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:31.219 
when this Meza Caudill starts to sense
light<00:05:28.620> becoming<00:05:29.280> available<00:05:29.400> it<00:05:30.030> stops<00:05:30.509> and

00:05:31.219 --> 00:05:31.229 
light becoming available it stops and

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:33.770 
light becoming available it stops and
then<00:05:32.009> the<00:05:32.310> chute<00:05:32.550> goes<00:05:32.789> upwards<00:05:33.300> from<00:05:33.570> there

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
then the chute goes upwards from there

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.860 
then the chute goes upwards from there
and<00:05:34.770> so<00:05:35.009> really<00:05:35.820> from<00:05:35.969> about<00:05:36.150> right<00:05:36.509> here

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
and so really from about right here

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.350 
and so really from about right here
where<00:05:37.169> my<00:05:37.199> pencil<00:05:37.680> mark<00:05:37.889> is<00:05:38.070> down<00:05:38.639> to<00:05:38.969> the<00:05:39.090> seed

where my pencil mark is down to the seed

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.649 
where my pencil mark is down to the seed
is<00:05:39.750> my<00:05:40.110> planting<00:05:40.530> depth<00:05:40.789> and<00:05:41.789> you<00:05:42.360> can<00:05:42.509> usually

00:05:42.649 --> 00:05:42.659 
is my planting depth and you can usually

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:44.420 
is my planting depth and you can usually
go<00:05:42.900> into<00:05:43.050> about<00:05:43.229> any<00:05:43.409> cornfield<00:05:43.979> and<00:05:44.219> you<00:05:44.280> can

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
go into about any cornfield and you can

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.279 
go into about any cornfield and you can
figure<00:05:44.639> out<00:05:44.759> your<00:05:44.880> planting<00:05:45.330> depth<00:05:45.570> pretty

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:46.289 
figure out your planting depth pretty

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:47.749 
figure out your planting depth pretty
consistently<00:05:46.979> as<00:05:47.130> you're<00:05:47.280> looking<00:05:47.520> to<00:05:47.610> see

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:47.759 
consistently as you're looking to see

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:50.240 
consistently as you're looking to see
where<00:05:47.940> that<00:05:48.090> root<00:05:48.270> is<00:05:48.479> or<00:05:49.020> that<00:05:49.710> line<00:05:49.979> is

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:50.250 
where that root is or that line is

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.730 
where that root is or that line is
approximately<00:05:50.580> with<00:05:51.150> us<00:05:51.270> all<00:05:51.449> surfaces<00:05:52.050> but

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
approximately with us all surfaces but

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.230 
approximately with us all surfaces but
again<00:05:53.009> you'll<00:05:53.190> always<00:05:53.310> find<00:05:53.580> in<00:05:53.729> this<00:05:53.789> region

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 
again you'll always find in this region

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.719 
again you'll always find in this region
here<00:05:54.360> the<00:05:54.539> first<00:05:54.780> node<00:05:55.110> that<00:05:55.889> separates<00:05:56.430> kind

00:05:56.719 --> 00:05:56.729 
here the first node that separates kind

00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:58.879 
here the first node that separates kind
of<00:05:56.819> the<00:05:56.880> rest<00:05:57.120> of<00:05:57.270> the<00:05:57.389> chute<00:05:57.630> the<00:05:58.409> upper<00:05:58.680> part

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960 
you go get your radical it comes from

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.770 
you go get your radical it comes from
the<00:06:10.080> corn<00:06:10.319> kernel<00:06:10.710> the<00:06:11.699> chute<00:06:12.030> the<00:06:12.270> developing
