telling<00:03:31.880> you<00:03:32.150> but<00:03:32.690> they<00:03:32.870> beg<00:03:33.110> for<00:03:33.140> lamps<00:03:33.709> so<00:03:34.160> if

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
telling you but they beg for lamps so if

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.620

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:35.630 
you're gonna leave them there you really

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.410 
you're gonna leave them there you really
need<00:03:35.840> a<00:03:36.140> table<00:03:36.769> lamp<00:03:36.890> get<00:03:37.519> a<00:03:37.700> straight<00:03:38.060> shade

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
need a table lamp get a straight shade

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.060 
need a table lamp get a straight shade
because<00:03:39.110> it's<00:03:39.260> a<00:03:39.350> little<00:03:39.560> more<00:03:39.739> contemporary

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
because it's a little more contemporary

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:43.270 
because it's a little more contemporary
than<00:03:40.970> a<00:03:41.120> tapered<00:03:41.540> shade<00:03:41.810> and<00:03:42.110> height<00:03:42.829> you<00:03:42.980> want

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
than a tapered shade and height you want

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.699 
than a tapered shade and height you want
is<00:03:43.820> a<00:03:43.880> distance<00:03:44.360> of<00:03:44.450> 42<00:03:44.959> inches<00:03:45.260> from<00:03:45.590> the

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
is a distance of 42 inches from the

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.710 
is a distance of 42 inches from the

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:47.720 
floor to the bottom of your shade which

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.350 
floor to the bottom of your shade which
will<00:03:47.870> sit<00:03:48.049> just<00:03:48.079> above<00:03:48.470> your<00:03:48.620> shoulder<00:03:49.040> but<00:03:49.549> my

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
will sit just above your shoulder but my

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.819 
will sit just above your shoulder but my
preference<00:03:50.840> would<00:03:50.930> be<00:03:51.079> to<00:03:51.230> move<00:03:51.380> those<00:03:51.620> side

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:51.829 
preference would be to move those side

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:54.400 
preference would be to move those side
tables<00:03:52.250> and<00:03:52.489> to<00:03:53.269> use<00:03:53.390> floor<00:03:53.720> lamps<00:03:54.049> instead

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
tables and to use floor lamps instead

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.620 
tables and to use floor lamps instead
and<00:03:54.829> I<00:03:55.100> suggest<00:03:55.640> the<00:03:56.090> Thomas<00:03:56.480> O'Brien

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
and I suggest the Thomas O'Brien

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.009 
and I suggest the Thomas O'Brien
designed<00:03:57.350> lamp<00:03:57.709> for<00:03:58.370> visual<00:03:58.730> comfort<00:03:59.019> it's

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
designed lamp for visual comfort it's

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:02.620 
designed lamp for visual comfort it's
great<00:04:00.290> because<00:04:00.470> it<00:04:01.070> adjusts<00:04:01.340> and<00:04:01.910> has<00:04:02.150> a<00:04:02.180> paper

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
great because it adjusts and has a paper

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.420 
great because it adjusts and has a paper
shade<00:04:02.870> so<00:04:03.170> it<00:04:03.200> softly<00:04:03.709> diffuses<00:04:04.280> the<00:04:04.340> light

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
shade so it softly diffuses the light

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.630 
shade so it softly diffuses the light
and<00:04:04.790> it's<00:04:05.750> on<00:04:05.870> a<00:04:05.900> try<00:04:06.230> light<00:04:06.470> or<00:04:06.739> a<00:04:07.040> dimmer<00:04:07.280> so

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
and it's on a try light or a dimmer so

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.949 
and it's on a try light or a dimmer so
that<00:04:07.790> you<00:04:07.880> can<00:04:08.060> control<00:04:08.360> the<00:04:08.570> amount<00:04:08.660> of<00:04:08.900> light

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
that you can control the amount of light

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:10.979 
that you can control the amount of light
if<00:04:09.680> you<00:04:09.890> want<00:04:09.980> to<00:04:10.100> make<00:04:10.220> a<00:04:10.250> real<00:04:10.670> statement

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
if you want to make a real statement

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:13.479 
if you want to make a real statement
there's<00:04:11.989> a<00:04:12.050> third<00:04:12.349> lamp<00:04:12.650> it's<00:04:12.980> like<00:04:13.190> a<00:04:13.220> piece

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
there's a third lamp it's like a piece

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:14.830 
there's a third lamp it's like a piece
of<00:04:13.520> sculpture<00:04:13.879> in<00:04:14.300> the<00:04:14.450> corner

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
of sculpture in the corner

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.409 
of sculpture in the corner
and<00:04:15.319> you<00:04:15.620> could<00:04:15.770> use<00:04:15.950> it<00:04:16.190> on<00:04:16.310> one<00:04:16.880> side<00:04:17.209> of<00:04:17.239> the

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
and you could use it on one side of the

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:19.569 
and you could use it on one side of the
sofa<00:04:17.630> it's<00:04:18.590> such<00:04:18.829> a<00:04:18.859> statement<00:04:19.190> that<00:04:19.459> you

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
sofa it's such a statement that you

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.099 
sofa it's such a statement that you
really<00:04:19.790> can<00:04:20.030> have<00:04:20.060> too<00:04:20.510> so<00:04:20.660> you<00:04:20.750> have<00:04:20.810> to<00:04:20.959> worry

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
really can have too so you have to worry

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:23.800 
really can have too so you have to worry
about<00:04:21.230> matching<00:04:21.799> and<00:04:21.950> it<00:04:22.010> has<00:04:22.160> three<00:04:22.669> heads<00:04:22.970> so

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
about matching and it has three heads so

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.860 
about matching and it has three heads so
you<00:04:23.840> can<00:04:24.139> control<00:04:24.470> the<00:04:24.710> light<00:04:25.090> by<00:04:26.090> turning

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
you can control the light by turning

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.020 
you can control the light by turning
them<00:04:26.990> all<00:04:27.110> on<00:04:27.350> or<00:04:27.530> just<00:04:27.770> one<00:04:28.010> it's<00:04:28.610> like<00:04:28.820> a

them all on or just one it's like a
piece<00:04:29.210> of<00:04:29.240> art<00:04:29.510> a<00:04:29.810> comb<00:04:30.680> lamp<00:04:30.950> could<00:04:31.130> go<00:04:31.310> right

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639 
piece of art a comb lamp could go right

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:34.060 
piece of art a comb lamp could go right
here<00:04:32.090> this<00:04:32.510> lamp<00:04:32.870> is<00:04:33.139> going<00:04:33.320> to<00:04:33.410> cast<00:04:33.650> light

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:42.100 
angle just the right way so the bulb
it's<00:04:40.130> not<00:04:40.280> a<00:04:40.580> glaring<00:04:41.090> problem<00:04:41.210> for<00:04:41.840> everyone
