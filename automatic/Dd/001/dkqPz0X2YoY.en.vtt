00:00:01.349 --> 00:00:06.100
 Hello together to a new nuclear plant Lyon around this time you see here is everything 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.320
 wonderful to recognize today I thought Maurus again relatively nice weather 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.360
 and I just did not feel like sitting in the dark so he light that 

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:17.230
 Leaning on the pardon I am sure playful not so there 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.890
 you can see him in my face 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:19.749
 it'll work 

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:23.550
 Underneath this is the miracle 56 Apple really has 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.029
 here, three costs 79 cents a tesco snow she generated at school i got it 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.189
 clear downloaded tried the winner was very funny 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.219
 and around that, however, we start with an app that doctors will be familiar with 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.969
 By the way, it also shares quite a bit in the 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.589
 Percentage 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:43.889
 and there are already an incredible number of stinginess for 

00:00:43.889 --> 00:00:47.060
 this hard it has been really successful 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.870
 at the beginning of the attitude also plans 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.330
 you are this chronic bird in its nest 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:56.220
 You have to try to get as far as possible 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.430
 fly as possible 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.940
 and to collect as many points as possible in order to do that around her 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.980
 he taps on the screen then goes her son could be collecting points 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.190
 is resume 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.590
 our yes yes then squeeze 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.510
 around 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.250
 I always want to try a bit higher 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.450
 yes I'm not a master in this game again 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.700
 that should have found by now so and then tried 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:21.910
 really so high 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.630
 as possible to fly and not necessarily on the ground again and again 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:26.570
 stay so little 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.350
 around now at the end of every fair play of the island there is such a percent 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.860
 Graduation and to be recommended here by the air comes to the new island 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.630
 and the app that then rebuilt it differently, that is different 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.090
 Underground so a bit of variety comes in with everything 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.950
 around 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.220
 if he has a Levin or if he has a certain high score then 

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:50.290
 also gets new investor with the inside I think a bit faster 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:52.250
 if I understood correctly 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.930
 and you've got what you can say to the app it's definitely extreme 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.430
 addictive to have many are so compared to the addictive potential of 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.549
 Engelbert Soeder Deubel comes 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.979
 I have to say he makes this app even more fun to watch 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.700
 It costs just 79 cents and was a lot of fun because in any case 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.009
 download 

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:15.890
 Werner which is mainly in power and his left 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.180
 We continue to give a game, Alpay Uelzen colon no one 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.270
 Bolz sees play and these games I think was from a Frenchman 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.409
 In any case, the iTunes description is in French 

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:32.129
 malnourished media he once froze on Kley and I'll be like you 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:33.819
 can be what it's about 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.269
 Mr MÃ¶hlmann bit me out because I had to move the iPod easily 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:40.110
 Gameplay is really a very cool interesting 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.589
 you are this one over 

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:45.459
 and pirate or viking I do not know exactly this boat must compete 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.389
 and then at the right moment in the approaching ball, so to speak 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:53.159
 kick back socks again bot expected to wait for those on you 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:57.069
 shoot and everything has to stop here in this bright area 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.669
 Center that can shoot back in time 

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:02.409
 that's one to become the whole gameplay 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:06.589
 But it's a lot of fun, especially because the ball is always flying to it 

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:09.799
 she takes fun and it is fun to sink soil 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:12.840
 The same principle sinking ships is already percent longer 

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:13.809
 successfully 

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:15.539
 and Sam 

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:19.019
 I have to say really is very cool in the beginning it is very nice and quiet 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:21.140
 Â«You can choose ships boss here 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.280
 but later on it will really sound like a sack, so to speak 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.839
 because you really have to 

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:31.849
 An incredible number of beer ships then are the ones of all kinds of shooting 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:35.489
 Of course, this was not the place to come here 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:36.659
 have more this year 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:38.380
 but how does arise meet here 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.120
 the percent Lames ad will be here for a while since I've been paying attention 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.970
 Since most of the living and ambience then would have to be really very sack 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.609
 some boats percentages need 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:52.099
 two or have to be canceled twice and it will start again 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:58.249
 and at that we control the pirates with the help of the controls 

00:03:58.249 --> 00:04:01.769
 determined has already noticed and now he is again critical dpa 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.500
 yes, even if you can say that with me 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.200
 really makes her a lot of fun is not very much in the end 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.490
 varied but 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.350
 this is not enough to really clean up Principe 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.020
 to challenge because you always 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.660
 The boat still needs a lease but the ball must be on and with help 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.220
 the TVI disturbances must move pirates that means I want it from this 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:25.870
 Challenging plays definitely a percent of a jackdaw red missing 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.960
 before I break this humorous one here 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.380
 Gamer my dear next to the next and he calls himself the young Sterk 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.050
 level 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.110
 our Jana Sohm HÃ¶rbiger little household even the right button Resch 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.680
 and while she is destroying this and she is likely to be a me too 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.889
 be known to many also start with them and recorded 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:48.690
 because I've always been a loser 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:53.510
 so who are you this ladybird and have to roll up in your garden 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.319
 makes you in those of the ladybugs here all the time automatically East 

00:04:57.319 --> 00:05:01.189
 and 4 to clean up these mushrooms here and of course the enemies here 

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:02.370
 move the screen 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.500
 if you found this Rey against others still get extra points or 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.360
 Eg when we meet in the snail also eggs special abilities 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.800
 then there are also still running here then just spiders around halved 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.930
 Best Buy or Bees It can not be said that the flies on too 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.870
 to just here on the screen there is also a BOS opponent you can do 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:22.909
 must defeat 

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:27.560
 Everything sounds very good and makes a lot of fun even for a short time 

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:29.860
 and I really had a lot of fun with it 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.979
 my problem with this app is that it's here too sooner 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:37.480
 Buy longer period just does not provide enough variety 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:41.300
 you already have seen many games of this kind and they work in the 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:46.030
 but all the same and then in Vienna, this app does not bring quite as much new 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.980
 Momentum and really he very very long to motivate anyway for a short 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:53.250
 Period definitely makes this process beautifully designed 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:57.310
 That's why the sound percent got annoying that's why I like to play 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:57.789
 or 

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:01.119
 but every five short period definitely worth a look and who 

00:06:01.119 --> 00:06:03.790
 anyway after a game explores this budget 

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:06.800
 he should just beat that 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.120
 the app costs 79 1 percent but I said at the beginning that the 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.539
 first three on their feet and looks at costs 

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:17.069
 should we go on to the last AP I'm really in it right now 

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:20.199
 downloaded at school and I thought so come 

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:23.539
 Century know it calls itself a euro 

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:26.800
 and jackets under the crossbar "useless knowledge 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.800
 I just needed something where I can laugh 

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:34.439
 Everything here in this app really is very minimalistic 

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:38.289
 you see you have you a copywriter then something percent funny 

00:06:38.289 --> 00:06:40.900
 totally meaningless what she actually does not need 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.389
 but El water is sometimes quite funny that is then all of them per 

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:48.710
 Random percent of Ole conceded the coincidence is for it is not used enough 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:49.790
 but the case will be 

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:52.880
 for example, everyone is shown living and being the first pack of the world 

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.320
 Clearly set up by Washington, it may not be the most exciting 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:02.000
 These are despite some are very funny for example 

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.590
 Say I found that cool, the United States has never had one 

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:07.770
 War was lost in addition to their structurally used goods 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:11.229
 WiGig senseless know who but his classmates just one with something nephews 

00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:12.800
 I want it as I did 

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.880
 quite cool for the SWR problem case 

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:16.550
 what bothers me is that he 

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:19.639
 and the typeface is a bit small that's easy up here 

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:23.590
 takes up a lot of space unnecessarily, that means you could rather get up a bit 

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:24.830
 expand the text 

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:28.430
 the sayings are not so diverse percent that is just one 

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:29.910
 extensive percent 

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:33.270
 Unfortunately, the LGT does not want to find the copywriter Sawade 

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:36.570
 even the random generator shows sometimes so three people at the 

00:07:36.569 --> 00:07:39.960
 same it may not be so great there the app is free only 

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.660
 rarely few funny sayings with it and therefore 

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:46.160
 Percent for all the general schools need a bit of variety 

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:49.440
 The app is definitely good for that and most of all it's free 

00:07:50.369 --> 00:07:54.709
 and while the water is already eating again this month 56 APA Vienna me 

00:07:54.709 --> 00:07:57.969
 I thought I would have to be longer Laumann but now only just 8 

00:07:57.969 --> 00:08:01.300
 Minutes Gornig offer from nevertheless interested listened 

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.419
 under "Of course I want comments on comments and 

00:08:05.009 --> 00:08:07.619
 yes, exactly where we also net percent, I would of course be happy about it 

00:08:07.619 --> 00:08:08.600
 otherwise 

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.120
 I have nothing left to say and I'm out of here
