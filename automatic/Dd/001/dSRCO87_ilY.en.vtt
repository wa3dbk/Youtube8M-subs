this<00:00:33.440> particular<00:00:34.040> project<00:00:34.310> is<00:00:34.700> intended<00:00:35.300> to

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
this particular project is intended to

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.140 
this particular project is intended to
become<00:00:35.750> a<00:00:35.810> conservation<00:00:36.560> project<00:00:37.070> because<00:00:37.910> we

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.150 
become a conservation project because we

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.300 
become a conservation project because we
breathe<00:00:38.450> butterflies<00:00:39.020> naturally<00:00:39.770> and<00:00:40.070> then

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:40.310 
breathe butterflies naturally and then

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.030 
breathe butterflies naturally and then
for<00:00:40.640> the<00:00:40.760> 60%<00:00:41.570> we<00:00:41.750> are<00:00:41.840> putting<00:00:42.080> and<00:00:42.410> utilizing

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
for the 60% we are putting and utilizing

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.490 
for the 60% we are putting and utilizing
in<00:00:43.160> our<00:00:43.280> small<00:00:43.670> enclosures<00:00:44.330> and<00:00:44.630> then<00:00:45.170> for<00:00:45.410> the

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
in our small enclosures and then for the

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.130 
in our small enclosures and then for the
remaining<00:00:45.920> 40<00:00:46.450> releasing<00:00:47.450> back<00:00:47.690> to<00:00:48.020> the

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
remaining 40 releasing back to the

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.210 
remaining 40 releasing back to the
nature<00:00:48.530> why<00:00:49.430> is<00:00:49.489> City<00:00:49.970> Hall<00:00:50.230> so<00:00:51.230> actually<00:00:52.040> we

this point we are making this as a

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.590 
this point we are making this as a
self-sustaining<00:02:07.160> project<00:02:07.640> so<00:02:08.239> whatever

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
self-sustaining project so whatever

well as some are extra donations for the
improvements<00:02:13.910> and<00:02:14.030> of<00:02:14.120> course<00:02:14.360> maintenance

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
improvements and of course maintenance

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:31.680 
improvements and of course maintenance
of<00:02:15.140> this<00:02:15.290> project

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.810 

it'll<00:02:32.410> break<00:02:32.590> for<00:02:32.860> them<00:02:33.010> but<00:02:33.220> unless<00:02:33.580> they're

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
it'll break for them but unless they're

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:36.510 
it'll break for them but unless they're
I<00:02:33.970> keep<00:02:34.330> on<00:02:34.570> so<00:02:34.960> that's<00:02:35.530> where<00:02:35.770> shoot<00:02:36.040> over<00:02:36.370> the

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
I keep on so that's where shoot over the

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.340 
I keep on so that's where shoot over the
big<00:02:36.670> one<00:02:36.910> it's<00:02:37.090> the<00:02:37.330> female<00:02:37.750> one<00:02:37.930> in<00:02:38.140> that's

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
big one it's the female one in that's

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:42.060 
big one it's the female one in that's
the<00:02:38.620> male<00:02:38.800> and<00:02:39.130> then<00:02:39.850> there'll<00:02:40.660> be<00:02:40.780> like<00:02:41.080> when

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
the male and then there'll be like when

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.860 
the male and then there'll be like when
they're<00:02:42.220> on<00:02:42.490> the<00:02:42.670> flight<00:02:42.940> most<00:02:43.300> likely<00:02:43.600> the

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
they're on the flight most likely the

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.110 
they're on the flight most likely the
female<00:02:44.230> that's<00:02:44.470> the<00:02:44.650> word<00:02:44.830> takes<00:02:45.400> 24<00:02:46.090> hours

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
female that's the word takes 24 hours

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.910 
female that's the word takes 24 hours
because<00:02:46.540> they<00:02:46.810> meet<00:02:46.990> only<00:02:47.200> once<00:02:48.900> 24<00:02:49.900> meet<00:02:50.740> only

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
because they meet only once 24 meet only

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.860 
because they meet only once 24 meet only
once<00:02:51.220> it<00:02:51.700> made<00:02:51.910> the<00:02:52.030> only<00:02:52.090> one<00:02:52.390> so<00:02:52.600> I<00:02:52.630> think

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
once it made the only one so I think

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.600 
once it made the only one so I think
it's<00:02:53.170> gonna<00:02:53.410> be<00:02:53.590> the<00:02:53.710> reason<00:02:54.100> that<00:02:54.130> it<00:02:54.430> takes

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
it's gonna be the reason that it takes

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:58.740 
it's gonna be the reason that it takes
24<00:02:55.270> hours<00:02:55.330> because<00:02:55.750> they<00:02:56.020> make<00:02:56.170> only<00:02:56.530> once
