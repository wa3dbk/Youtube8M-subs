things about the smart Wi-Fi application

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.319 
things about the smart Wi-Fi application
first<00:00:50.950> how<00:00:51.160> to<00:00:51.190> get<00:00:51.340> a<00:00:51.399> running<00:00:51.610> and<00:00:51.880> second

first how to get a running and second

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:53.250 
first how to get a running and second
how<00:00:52.390> to<00:00:52.450> make<00:00:52.630> sure<00:00:52.780> it's<00:00:52.899> configured

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
how to make sure it's configured

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.979 
how to make sure it's configured
properly<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:54.550> smart<00:00:54.820> Wi-Fi<00:00:55.120> application<00:00:55.840> is

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
properly the smart Wi-Fi application is

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:57.990 
properly the smart Wi-Fi application is
actually<00:00:56.500> a<00:00:56.620> background<00:00:57.100> process<00:00:57.160> which

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
actually a background process which

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.030 
actually a background process which
means<00:00:58.239> it<00:00:58.360> runs<00:00:58.540> all<00:00:58.690> the<00:00:58.719> time<00:00:58.989> when<00:00:59.920> your

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.040 
means it runs all the time when your

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.770 
means it runs all the time when your
smartphone<00:01:00.460> is<00:01:00.550> connected<00:01:00.910> to<00:01:00.969> Wi-Fi<00:01:01.120> the

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
smartphone is connected to Wi-Fi the

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.389 
smartphone is connected to Wi-Fi the
smart<00:01:02.020> application<00:01:02.530> will<00:01:02.649> run<00:01:02.829> automatically

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:03.399 
smart application will run automatically

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:05.700 
smart application will run automatically
so<00:01:04.299> the<00:01:04.420> trick<00:01:04.600> to<00:01:04.689> making<00:01:04.869> smart<00:01:05.199> Wi-Fi<00:01:05.500> work

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
so the trick to making smart Wi-Fi work

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.590 
so the trick to making smart Wi-Fi work
is<00:01:05.890> to<00:01:06.340> get<00:01:06.490> your<00:01:06.610> smartphone<00:01:07.060> connected<00:01:07.509> to

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
is to get your smartphone connected to

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.010 
is to get your smartphone connected to
Wi-Fi<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:09.159> turn<00:01:09.369> on<00:01:09.520> Wi-Fi<00:01:09.899> select<00:01:10.899> the

00:01:29.849 --> 00:01:29.859 
security code once connected the smart

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:34.669 
security code once connected the smart
Wi-Fi<00:01:30.189> application<00:01:30.759> will<00:01:30.880> run<00:01:31.090> automatically

00:01:34.669 --> 00:01:34.679 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:38.969 

in<00:01:36.539> some<00:01:37.539> cases<00:01:37.779> the<00:01:38.139> application<00:01:38.649> might<00:01:38.829> not

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
in some cases the application might not

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:40.889 
in some cases the application might not
be<00:01:39.099> set<00:01:39.279> to<00:01:39.310> run<00:01:39.520> automatically<00:01:40.090> so<00:01:40.719> let's

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:40.899 
be set to run automatically so let's

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:42.330 
be set to run automatically so let's
check<00:01:41.170> the<00:01:41.289> settings<00:01:41.619> to<00:01:41.799> make<00:01:41.920> sure<00:01:42.069> you<00:01:42.219> get
