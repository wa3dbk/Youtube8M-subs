00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:02.420
Perpetuity Calculation in 6 Minutes Present
Value of a Perpetuity Formula

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:03.420
Okay.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.100
Welcome back once again to mpabullshit.com.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:12.519
So our topic for this video is value of a
perpetuity.

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:13.519
Alright.

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:22.840
So remember you can always go back to MBAbullshit.com
for lots of cool videos to help you out with

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:23.840
this topic.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:30.800
Now before this video, you should already
know future value and present value.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:38.940
So you can watch my other free videos on future
value and present value if you do not know

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.149
these topics yet.

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:42.550
Alright.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:50.370
So let’s start with an easy question and
you’ll also [0:00:46.4] to be easy, I promise.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.370
Alright.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:57.369
What if you had one hundred dollars at the
bank and the bank was giving you five percent

00:00:57.369 --> 00:01:01.569
interest per year, every year forever?

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:03.279
Okay?

00:01:03.279 --> 00:01:07.619
So how much cash would you get every year?

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.510
Okay, you get five percent.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.170
So how much cash is that every year?

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.780
That’s easy.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:21.119
One hundred dollars times zero point zero
five which means five percent, you will get

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.750
five dollars per year.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.579
Okay, now that’s very easy.

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:30.440
So now let’s turn the story around.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.670
What if you want the bank to give you five
dollars per year forever?

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:36.670
Okay?

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.570
How much do you need to deposit?

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.619
Well, we already know one hundred dollars.

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:46.880
Okay, same as here.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.280
Okay, same as here.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:59.060
So now the question is what if you had a magic
wand and it guarantee you that you will get

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.549
five dollars every year for the rest of your
life?

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:08.470
Okay, this is five dollars every year for
the rest of your life.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:09.750
Okay?

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:17.599
If someone wanted to buy this magic wand from
you, how much will you sell it?

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:18.980
Okay?

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:25.489
Well, you would sell it for a certain amount
of money, okay?

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:33.709
So that you can put this money in the bank
and then you’ll continue to earn five dollars

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.349
a year forever in interest.

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:38.459
Okay?

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.040
So how much is that?

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.599
Well, we already know it’s one hundred dollars,
right?

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:50.909
You need to sell this wand for one hundred
dollars so that you can put the one hundred

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:59.689
dollars in the bank and you can continue to
earn the five dollars a year that this wand

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:01.450
was giving you.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.590
Alright?

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:03.730
Simple.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.010
Very simple.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:14.299
So now, I’ve got good news for you and that
is that this magic wand actually exists.

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:15.480
Okay?

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.659
Now, however it doesn’t really look like
a wand.

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:25.220
It looks like a piece of paper or a contract
and it is called a perpetuity.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.220
Alright?

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.030
It’s called a perpetuity.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.849
So it comes from the word perpetual which
also means forever.

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:36.319
So I don’t know if you’re catholic.

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:41.239
You know the Catholics, they pray to this
is it mother of perpetual help or something

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:42.239
like that.

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.310
I think mother Mary or no.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.610
In some Christian funerals they say, “Oh
God”.

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:57.079
A catholic funeral they say, “God, please
let your perpetual light shine upon his soul.”

00:03:57.079 --> 00:04:01.120
It means please shine upon his soul forever.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.480
Excuse me.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.659
Alright.

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:15.010
So now how do we mathematically estimate the
value of the magic wand or the value of the

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.010
perpetuity?

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.010
Okay?

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:21.570
How did we mathematically get the value of
one hundred?

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:22.570
Okay?

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.780
So for that we use an easy formula which looks
like this.

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:28.780
Okay?

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:37.560
Value of a perpetuity equals the yearly cash
flow divided by the interest rate.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.790
Okay?

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:44.100
And you already know that the yearly cash
flow is five dollars and the interest rate

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:53.630
is five percent written mathematically as
zero point zero five, and we find that five

00:04:53.630 --> 00:05:01.090
dollars divided by zero point zero five is
one hundred dollars.

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:08.380
So there you can see how simple it is to get
the value of a perpetuity.

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:09.980
Alright?

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:18.740
So now that you know the basic concept of
how to get a value of a perpetuity, you’re

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:25.850
now ready to move on to our next video on
the value of a growing perpetuity where the

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.730
cash payment increases every year.

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:36.120
So in this case, it was just a flat five dollars
every year, and every year it was the same

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.770
but what if this increases every year to a
bigger that five dollars, and then bigger

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:45.080
the next, and even bigger than next, next
year?

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.360
So that is called the value of a growing perpetuity.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:58.770
