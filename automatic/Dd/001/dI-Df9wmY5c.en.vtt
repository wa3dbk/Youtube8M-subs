00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
light spectrum seems to be perfect for

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.959 
light spectrum seems to be perfect for
vegging<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:46.559> flowering<00:00:46.829> we're<00:00:47.610> currently<00:00:47.789> at

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
vegging and flowering we're currently at

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.090 
vegging and flowering we're currently at
nine<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.390> half<00:00:48.420> weeks<00:00:48.690> here<00:00:48.870> hmm<00:00:49.379> so<00:00:50.039> are

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
nine and a half weeks here hmm so are

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.950 
nine and a half weeks here hmm so are
these<00:00:50.219> advancing<00:00:50.820> similar<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:51.660> what<00:00:51.809> you've

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
these advancing similar to what you've

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.869 
these advancing similar to what you've
seen<00:00:52.110> under<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.590> HPS<00:00:53.070> rose<00:00:53.280> definitely

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
seen under the HPS rose definitely

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.600 
seen under the HPS rose definitely
definitely<00:00:54.030> done<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:55.500> start<00:00:55.770> trimming<00:00:56.039> the

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
definitely done you start trimming the

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.430 
definitely done you start trimming the
side<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.270> smaller<00:00:57.600> side<00:00:57.899> branches<00:00:58.289> like

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
side and the smaller side branches like

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.439 
side and the smaller side branches like
this<00:00:58.649> piece<00:00:59.010> right<00:00:59.160> here<00:00:59.309> probably<00:01:00.000> four<00:01:00.270> days

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
this piece right here probably four days

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.049 
this piece right here probably four days
ago<00:01:00.750> is<00:01:00.930> like<00:01:01.109> way<00:01:01.980> down<00:01:02.190> here<00:01:02.460> half<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.670> size

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
ago is like way down here half the size

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.450 
ago is like way down here half the size
so<00:01:03.930> that's<00:01:04.110> definitely<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.739> growth<00:01:04.979> houston

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
so that's definitely the growth houston

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.030 
so that's definitely the growth houston
is<00:01:05.610> like<00:01:05.909> so<00:01:06.330> would<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.570> say<00:01:06.600> this<00:01:06.930> 400<00:01:07.830> series

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
is like so would you say this 400 series

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.859 
is like so would you say this 400 series
is<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.369> really<00:01:08.760> good<00:01:08.909> size<00:01:09.180> match<00:01:09.510> for<00:01:09.810> this

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
is a really good size match for this

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.850 
is a really good size match for this
size<00:01:10.110> pant<00:01:10.409> perfect

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
size pant perfect

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.560 
size pant perfect
and<00:01:12.370> I<00:01:12.460> see<00:01:12.640> the<00:01:12.760> tomatoes<00:01:13.120> what<00:01:13.300> do<00:01:13.360> we<00:01:13.450> have

here because tomatoes obviously need a

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.670 
here because tomatoes obviously need a
higher<00:01:23.830> nutrient<00:01:24.310> strength<00:01:24.610> and<00:01:24.850> these<00:01:24.970> don't

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
higher nutrient strength and these don't

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.230 
higher nutrient strength and these don't
flatly<00:01:26.680> still<00:01:27.220> kind<00:01:27.400> of<00:01:27.520> fine<00:01:27.730> yeah<00:01:28.000> they<00:01:28.120> look

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.609 
under the HBS would be well yeah these
are<00:01:42.370> cherry<00:01:42.700> tomatoes<00:01:43.120> and<00:01:43.300> they're<00:01:43.420> huge<00:01:43.960> it

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
are cherry tomatoes and they're huge it

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:46.560 
are cherry tomatoes and they're huge it
really<00:01:44.800> are<00:01:45.009> yeah<00:01:45.310> so<00:01:45.729> and<00:01:45.940> so<00:01:46.420> I<00:01:46.479> think

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
really are yeah so and so I think

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.320 
really are yeah so and so I think
quality<00:01:47.200> and<00:01:47.380> quantity<00:01:48.280> is<00:01:48.550> on<00:01:48.759> par<00:01:48.970> with<00:01:49.030> your

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
quality and quantity is on par with your

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.090 
quality and quantity is on par with your
HBS<00:01:49.720> grows<00:01:49.960> for<00:01:50.170> a<00:01:50.200> lot<00:01:50.350> less<00:01:50.500> wattage<00:01:50.770> and

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
HBS grows for a lot less wattage and

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:52.410 
HBS grows for a lot less wattage and
then<00:01:51.400> certainly<00:01:51.670> we<00:01:51.759> don't<00:01:51.970> have<00:01:52.119> the<00:01:52.270> heat

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
then certainly we don't have the heat

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.760 
then certainly we don't have the heat
contributions<00:01:53.110> that<00:01:53.259> we<00:01:53.410> would<00:01:53.530> have<00:01:53.619> had

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
contributions that we would have had

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.040 
contributions that we would have had
with<00:01:53.950> the<00:01:53.979> HPS<00:01:54.520> or<00:01:54.729> so<00:01:54.940> you<00:01:55.270> know<00:01:55.390> this<00:01:55.720> this

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990
