savage beast that took a fancy to my
right<00:00:57.690> hand<00:00:59.030> when<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.329> came<00:01:00.719> out<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:00.899> hospital

after surgery my hand was in a disabling

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.219 
after surgery my hand was in a disabling
splint<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.970> had<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.240> stay<00:01:06.479> in<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:06.720> splint

for<00:01:07.409> eight<00:01:07.770> weeks<00:01:07.820> and<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:09.180> meant<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:09.689> for

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
for eight weeks and that meant that for

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.929 
for eight weeks and that meant that for
two<00:01:10.260> months<00:01:10.619> I<00:01:10.799> was<00:01:11.040> not<00:01:11.310> going<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.549> be<00:01:11.700> able<00:01:11.790> to

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
two months I was not going to be able to

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.469 
two months I was not going to be able to
take<00:01:12.150> any<00:01:12.420> photos<00:01:13.040> this<00:01:14.040> was<00:01:14.790> an<00:01:14.970> intolerable

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
take any photos this was an intolerable

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.020 
take any photos this was an intolerable
state<00:01:15.869> of<00:01:15.990> affairs<00:01:16.400> and<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.580> occurred<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:17.880> me

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
state of affairs and it occurred to me

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.030 
state of affairs and it occurred to me
that<00:01:18.299> I<00:01:18.479> couldn't<00:01:18.810> possibly<00:01:19.080> be<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.590> only

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
that I couldn't possibly be the only

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.940 
that I couldn't possibly be the only
person<00:01:20.460> in<00:01:20.759> the<00:01:20.909> world<00:01:20.960> who<00:01:21.960> had<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.530> use<00:01:22.710> of

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
person in the world who had the use of

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.060 
person in the world who had the use of
only<00:01:23.220> my<00:01:23.790> left<00:01:24.030> hand<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.659> an<00:01:25.320> ambition<00:01:25.950> to

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
only my left hand and an ambition to

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.210 
only my left hand and an ambition to
take<00:01:26.310> photographs<00:01:26.610> with<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.240> serious<00:01:27.720> camera

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
take photographs with a serious camera

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.469 
take photographs with a serious camera
so<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:29.460> looked<00:01:29.670> through<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.939> commercial

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
so I looked through a commercial

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.390 
so I looked through a commercial
solution<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.170> problem<00:01:31.560> all<00:01:31.860> of<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.189> usual

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
for something as simple as a pistol grip

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.999

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
it some thought

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.300 
it some thought
and<00:01:58.920> I<00:01:59.640> thought<00:02:00.149> if<00:02:00.420> I'm<00:02:00.600> going<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.229> modify<00:02:01.740> any

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
and I thought if I'm going to modify any

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.179 
and I thought if I'm going to modify any
camera<00:02:03.000> so<00:02:03.659> that<00:02:03.689> it<00:02:03.990> can<00:02:04.200> be<00:02:04.320> used<00:02:04.560> with<00:02:04.890> just

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
camera so that it can be used with just

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.089 
camera so that it can be used with just
a<00:02:05.460> left<00:02:06.030> hand<00:02:06.360> probably<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.439> best<00:02:07.649> type<00:02:08.069> of

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
a left hand probably the best type of

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.969 
a left hand probably the best type of
camera<00:02:08.610> is<00:02:08.759> something<00:02:09.179> like<00:02:09.360> this<00:02:09.690> Olympus

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
camera is something like this Olympus

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.290 
camera is something like this Olympus
one<00:02:11.360> because<00:02:12.680> it's<00:02:13.680> reasonably<00:02:14.160> light<00:02:14.430> it's

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
one because it's reasonably light it's

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.259 
one because it's reasonably light it's
quite<00:02:15.660> compact<00:02:16.170> but<00:02:16.560> it<00:02:17.459> produces<00:02:18.060> images

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
quite compact but it produces images

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.600 
quite compact but it produces images
comparable<00:02:19.170> with<00:02:19.319> those<00:02:19.560> from<00:02:19.860> any<00:02:20.069> digital

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
comparable with those from any digital

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.229 
comparable with those from any digital
single-lens<00:02:21.030> reflex<00:02:21.860> so<00:02:22.860> this<00:02:23.459> had<00:02:23.760> all<00:02:24.030> of

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
single-lens reflex so this had all of

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.000 
single-lens reflex so this had all of
the<00:02:24.390> qualities<00:02:24.870> that<00:02:24.900> I<00:02:25.260> wanted<00:02:25.650> for<00:02:25.980> a

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
the qualities that I wanted for a

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.420 
the qualities that I wanted for a
desirable<00:02:26.849> left-handed<00:02:27.480> camera<00:02:28.160> how<00:02:29.160> was<00:02:29.310> I

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
desirable left-handed camera how was I

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.850 
desirable left-handed camera how was I
going<00:02:29.610> to<00:02:29.670> hold<00:02:29.910> it<00:02:30.290> well<00:02:31.290> I<00:02:31.319> knew<00:02:31.650> that<00:02:31.680> a

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
going to hold it well I knew that a

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.309 
going to hold it well I knew that a
pistol<00:02:32.280> grip<00:02:32.310> was<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:33.000> obvious<00:02:33.450> and<00:02:33.959> ideal

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
pistol grip was the obvious and ideal

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.259 
pistol grip was the obvious and ideal
solution<00:02:34.890> but<00:02:35.099> as<00:02:35.220> I<00:02:35.340> couldn't<00:02:35.640> find<00:02:35.880> one<00:02:36.090> I'd

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
solution but as I couldn't find one I'd

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.440 
solution but as I couldn't find one I'd
have<00:02:36.300> to<00:02:36.540> make<00:02:36.660> my<00:02:36.900> own<00:02:37.280> in<00:02:38.280> my<00:02:38.310> box<00:02:38.940> of<00:02:39.209> bits

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
have to make my own in my box of bits

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.740 
have to make my own in my box of bits
and<00:02:39.660> pieces<00:02:39.900> I<00:02:40.440> had<00:02:41.370> some<00:02:41.640> of<00:02:41.760> these<00:02:41.940> Kodak

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
thought if I can put these two things

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:44.990 
thought if I can put these two things
together

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
together

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.259 
together

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
the tripod and the cable release and

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.660 
the tripod and the cable release and
turn<00:03:49.200> them<00:03:49.410> into<00:03:49.500> and<00:03:49.859> what<00:03:49.980> is<00:03:50.100> more<00:03:50.370> or<00:03:50.489> less

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
turn them into and what is more or less

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.250 
turn them into and what is more or less
a<00:03:51.139> single<00:03:52.139> unit<00:03:52.920> I<00:03:53.190> could<00:03:53.970> have<00:03:54.239> a<00:03:54.599> very

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
a single unit I could have a very

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.270 
a single unit I could have a very

I<00:04:01.730> bought<00:04:02.730> this<00:04:03.620> handlebar<00:04:04.620> grip<00:04:04.920> from<00:04:05.099> the

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
I bought this handlebar grip from the

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.780 
I bought this handlebar grip from the
local<00:04:05.549> rubber<00:04:05.790> shop<00:04:06.120> cost<00:04:07.049> me<00:04:07.200> $5<00:04:07.919> and<00:04:08.430> they

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
local rubber shop cost me $5 and they

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.430 
local rubber shop cost me $5 and they
come<00:04:09.150> in<00:04:09.389> different<00:04:09.450> sizes<00:04:10.010> and<00:04:11.010> I<00:04:11.880> found<00:04:12.440> that

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
come in different sizes and I found that

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.920 
come in different sizes and I found that
it<00:04:13.709> would<00:04:14.069> bind<00:04:14.519> the<00:04:14.880> two<00:04:15.120> pieces<00:04:15.450> together

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
it would bind the two pieces together

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.229 
it would bind the two pieces together
snugly<00:04:16.919> and<00:04:17.130> I<00:04:17.970> now<00:04:18.419> have<00:04:18.450> a<00:04:19.049> very<00:04:19.320> comfortable

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
and a shutter release here where my

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.000 
and a shutter release here where my
thumb<00:04:25.920> falls<00:04:27.000> naturally<00:04:28.000> and<00:04:28.270> easily<00:04:29.010> so

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
thumb falls naturally and easily so

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.890 
thumb falls naturally and easily so
there<00:04:30.220> it<00:04:30.310> was<00:04:30.520> it<00:04:30.760> was<00:04:30.880> no<00:04:31.030> trouble<00:04:31.240> at<00:04:31.480> all<00:04:31.630> to

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
there it was it was no trouble at all to

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.040 
there it was it was no trouble at all to
create<00:04:32.680> a<00:04:32.710> pistol<00:04:33.160> grip<00:04:33.190> for<00:04:33.520> the<00:04:33.580> camera<00:04:34.050> okay

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.050 
create a pistol grip for the camera okay

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.120 
create a pistol grip for the camera okay
now<00:04:35.350> we<00:04:35.410> attach<00:04:35.710> the<00:04:36.930> camera<00:04:37.930> to<00:04:38.140> the<00:04:38.470> grip<00:04:38.680> now

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
now we attach the camera to the grip now

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.480 
now we attach the camera to the grip now
all<00:04:39.340> of<00:04:39.760> these<00:04:39.880> obviously<00:04:40.780> I<00:04:41.020> had<00:04:42.010> to<00:04:42.040> get<00:04:42.310> help

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
all of these obviously I had to get help

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.670 
all of these obviously I had to get help
from<00:04:42.820> friends<00:04:43.360> when<00:04:43.570> I<00:04:43.600> only<00:04:43.840> had<00:04:44.170> the<00:04:44.290> use<00:04:44.320> of

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 
from friends when I only had the use of

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:51.560 
from friends when I only had the use of
one<00:04:44.890> hand<00:04:44.920> I<00:04:45.700> couldn't<00:04:45.970> do<00:04:46.180> this<00:04:46.630> myself

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.410 

there's<00:04:52.570> the<00:04:52.870> unit<00:04:53.200> the<00:04:54.040> camera<00:04:54.490> mounted<00:04:55.330> on

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:55.420 
there's the unit the camera mounted on

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.710 
there's the unit the camera mounted on
the<00:04:55.570> pistol<00:04:55.930> grip<00:04:55.960> my<00:04:56.890> left<00:04:57.130> hand<00:04:57.430> thumb<00:04:58.300> falls

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
the pistol grip my left hand thumb falls

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.660 
the pistol grip my left hand thumb falls
naturally<00:04:59.290> onto<00:05:00.250> the<00:05:00.370> shutter<00:05:00.580> release

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.670 
naturally onto the shutter release

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.380 
naturally onto the shutter release
button<00:05:01.410> so<00:05:02.410> the<00:05:02.890> only<00:05:03.070> drawback<00:05:03.850> with<00:05:04.150> this

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:04.390 
button so the only drawback with this

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:08.330 
button so the only drawback with this
system<00:05:05.170> that<00:05:05.590> I<00:05:05.710> have<00:05:06.010> found<00:05:06.310> is<00:05:07.060> that<00:05:07.240> the

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
system that I have found is that the

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:13.800 
system that I have found is that the
table<00:05:09.340> on<00:05:09.580> the<00:05:10.510> Olympus<00:05:11.350> table<00:05:11.800> release<00:05:12.270> is<00:05:13.270> so

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
table on the Olympus table release is so

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:19.080 
table on the Olympus table release is so
very<00:05:14.560> very<00:05:15.010> long<00:05:15.430> that<00:05:16.330> I<00:05:16.750> have<00:05:17.530> had<00:05:17.740> to<00:05:18.090> bundle

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
very very long that I have had to bundle

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:22.170 
very very long that I have had to bundle
it<00:05:19.390> up<00:05:19.420> here<00:05:20.140> and<00:05:20.980> the<00:05:21.100> dangles<00:05:21.550> down<00:05:21.790> but<00:05:22.060> it

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 
it up here and the dangles down but it

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:28.830 
it up here and the dangles down but it
doesn't<00:05:22.420> get<00:05:22.540> in<00:05:22.630> the<00:05:22.720> way<00:05:27.180> so<00:05:28.180> there<00:05:28.660> we<00:05:28.810> are

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:28.840 
doesn't get in the way so there we are

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:32.340 
doesn't get in the way so there we are
there's<00:05:29.260> the<00:05:29.530> there's<00:05:30.100> the<00:05:30.370> camera<00:05:30.850> I<00:05:31.210> can<00:05:32.170> now

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:32.350 
there's the there's the camera I can now

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.980 
there's the there's the camera I can now
control<00:05:32.800> it<00:05:33.100> entirely<00:05:33.580> I<00:05:33.790> can<00:05:34.120> hold<00:05:34.420> it<00:05:34.600> I<00:05:34.810> can

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
control it entirely I can hold it I can

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.720 
control it entirely I can hold it I can
control<00:05:35.380> it<00:05:35.590> just<00:05:36.220> with<00:05:36.370> my<00:05:36.520> left<00:05:36.760> hand<00:05:38.700> take<00:05:39.700> a

control it just with my left hand take a
photo<00:05:40.030> so<00:05:41.790> for<00:05:42.790> those<00:05:43.420> of<00:05:43.480> you<00:05:43.960> who<00:05:44.440> feel<00:05:44.770> that

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:45.160 
photo so for those of you who feel that

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.280 
photo so for those of you who feel that
you<00:05:45.790> have<00:05:46.060> been<00:05:46.270> deprived<00:05:46.840> of<00:05:47.170> the

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:47.290 
you have been deprived of the

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.080 
you have been deprived of the
opportunity<00:05:47.950> of<00:05:48.190> becoming<00:05:48.730> a<00:05:48.910> photographer

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.090 
opportunity of becoming a photographer

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.930 
opportunity of becoming a photographer
because<00:05:49.870> you<00:05:50.020> only<00:05:50.200> have<00:05:50.470> a<00:05:50.500> left<00:05:50.740> hand<00:05:51.070> take

because you only have a left hand take

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.330 
because you only have a left hand take
heart<00:05:52.270> because<00:05:53.050> I<00:05:53.080> think<00:05:53.440> that<00:05:53.980> you<00:05:54.130> would

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:54.340 
heart because I think that you would

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:57.570 
heart because I think that you would
find<00:05:54.610> that<00:05:55.050> the<00:05:56.050> solution<00:05:56.800> to<00:05:56.830> the<00:05:57.100> problem<00:05:57.460> of

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:57.580 
find that the solution to the problem of

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.640 
find that the solution to the problem of
the<00:05:57.670> left-handed<00:05:58.180> camera<00:05:58.600> as<00:05:58.810> I<00:05:59.290> have<00:05:59.440> found

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 
the left-handed camera as I have found

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.690 
the left-handed camera as I have found
is<00:06:00.120> pretty<00:06:01.120> simple<00:06:01.540> and<00:06:01.810> inexpensive<00:06:02.460> so<00:06:03.460> go

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:03.700 
is pretty simple and inexpensive so go

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:04.110 
is pretty simple and inexpensive so go
for<00:06:03.970> it

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:04.120 
for it

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.350 
for it
and<00:06:04.300> happy<00:06:04.900> snapping
