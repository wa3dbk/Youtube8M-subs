00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.709 
what's ideal is a is a bait when it's
falling<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:56.850> follows<00:00:57.300> fall<00:00:57.480> on<00:00:57.600> the

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
falling it follows fall on the

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.450 
falling it follows fall on the
horizontal<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.410> that's<00:00:58.680> what<00:00:58.859> these<00:00:59.010> do<00:00:59.250> that

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
horizontal and that's what these do that

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.099 
horizontal and that's what these do that
weight<00:00:59.730> pulls<00:01:00.059> them<00:01:00.210> straight<00:01:00.510> down<00:01:00.719> so<00:01:00.989> they

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
weight pulls them straight down so they

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.360 
weight pulls them straight down so they
fall<00:01:01.350> in<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.469> horizontal<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:02.039> get<00:01:02.190> those

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
fall in the horizontal you get those

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.420 
fall in the horizontal you get those
closet<00:01:02.820> just<00:01:02.969> flutter<00:01:03.619> the<00:01:04.619> phenomenal<00:01:05.339> thing

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
about this bait is it is virtually

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.539 
about this bait is it is virtually
weightless<00:01:07.970> it<00:01:08.970> will<00:01:09.350> go<00:01:10.350> through<00:01:10.650> grass<00:01:11.159> it

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
weightless it will go through grass it

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.460 
weightless it will go through grass it
will<00:01:11.700> go<00:01:11.880> through<00:01:12.150> timber<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:12.930> can<00:01:13.080> pitch<00:01:13.320> it

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
will go through timber you can pitch it

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.020

will<00:01:18.540> snag<00:01:18.810> it<00:01:18.990> on<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.170> fall<00:01:19.380> because<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.650> lot

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
will snag it on the fall because a lot

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.530 
will snag it on the fall because a lot
of<00:01:19.890> times<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.250> has<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.400> slope<00:01:20.850> fall<00:01:21.119> rate<00:01:21.330> even

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
of times it has a slope fall rate even

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.510 
of times it has a slope fall rate even
with<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.900> 3/8<00:01:22.259> outs<00:01:22.530> it<00:01:22.740> has<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:22.890> fairly<00:01:23.189> slow

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
with the 3/8 outs it has a fairly slow

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.660 
with the 3/8 outs it has a fairly slow
fall<00:01:23.759> rate<00:01:24.000> um<00:01:24.740> the<00:01:25.740> way<00:01:25.950> I<00:01:25.979> rigged<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.549> is

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
fall rate um the way I rigged it is

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.450 
fall rate um the way I rigged it is
first<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:27.030> all<00:01:27.060> I<00:01:27.180> start<00:01:27.479> off<00:01:27.600> with<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.840> very

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
first of all I start off with a very

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.660 
first of all I start off with a very
good<00:01:29.460> swim<00:01:30.119> bait<00:01:30.329> hook<00:01:30.570> these<00:01:30.810> are<00:01:30.990> heavy<00:01:31.229> wire

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
good swim bait hook these are heavy wire

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.039 
good swim bait hook these are heavy wire
weighted<00:01:32.670> hooks<00:01:32.909> they're<00:01:33.180> made<00:01:33.390> by<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.600> company

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
weighted hooks they're made by a company

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.710 
weighted hooks they're made by a company
called<00:01:34.110> motor<00:01:34.619> hooks<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.880> reason<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:36.450> use

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
called motor hooks the reason I use

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.120 
called motor hooks the reason I use
motor<00:01:37.020> hooks<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.590> because<00:01:37.890> they<00:01:38.070> were

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
motor hooks is because they were

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.649 
motor hooks is because they were
designed<00:01:38.420> specifically<00:01:39.420> for<00:01:40.189> the<00:01:41.189> rage<00:01:41.659> the

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
designed specifically for the rage the

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.170 
designed specifically for the rage the
rage<00:01:42.840> rig<00:01:43.729> so<00:01:44.729> um<00:01:45.890> the<00:01:46.890> guy<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.460> I<00:01:47.790> guess<00:01:48.060> the

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
rage rig so um the guy that I guess the

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.710 
rage rig so um the guy that I guess the

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
to shake the fish from these hooks I try

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.570 
to shake the fish from these hooks I try
to<00:02:33.140> shake<00:02:33.410> a<00:02:33.440> few<00:02:33.680> yesterday<00:02:34.160> and<00:02:34.310> they<00:02:34.400> just

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580

so<00:02:37.250> I<00:02:37.340> guess<00:02:37.700> you<00:02:37.820> could<00:02:37.970> use<00:02:38.120> any<00:02:38.270> kill

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
so I guess you could use any kill

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.480 
so I guess you could use any kill
weighted<00:02:38.810> hook<00:02:38.959> the<00:02:39.740> main<00:02:39.920> reason<00:02:40.190> why<00:02:40.280> I<00:02:40.310> use

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
weighted hook the main reason why I use
