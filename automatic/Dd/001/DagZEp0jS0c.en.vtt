00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:07.100
 the beer guest interview 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.100
 and the doctor 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:08.850
 to forgive 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.659
 lacerda sampaio 

00:00:10.659 --> 00:00:14.779
 he specializes in partial plastic surgery 

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:16.589
 Among other things 

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:18.159
 He is the head of the group. 

00:00:18.159 --> 00:00:21.539
 Functional Plastic Surgery Phase 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.929
 of clinic day 14 in the laryngology of the hospital of the clinics 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.240
 gives by itself 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.130
 in Sao Paulo 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.330
 geek forgives or brazil is exaggerating 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.990
 plastic surgery and beauty of the face in the hair to assert with safety 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.170
 has two reasons that lead to plastic surgery 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.870
 on death's home 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.010
 we associate dead to the old ilga ilga sick 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.820
 and I the time that I see myself more rejuvenated 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.860
 I do not want to live farther from death itself an unconscious thing 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.140
 the other the more cruel the labor market is overcharging 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.820
 who sells anything imagined 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.980
 products or services 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.940
 one with the aged face 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.840
 what a dvd exactly 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.030
 with a lot of experience and maturity he's there 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.280
 a little 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.940
 left in band 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.270
 for a new face that sometimes does not have the experience would give 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.010
 politicians and with the C13 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.520
 then so woefully sure of working like me 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.920
 the iraq asked for a job and above 40 his name has to paint his hair do 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.460
 something does not come back 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.130
 this is cruel is the month and now there is some survey that indicated the 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.210
 donation surgery would be indemnified would require that all pierced by 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.890
 that most of them are neither 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:41.660
 much of the major league 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.660
 not a cd in statistics 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.120
 so then 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.010
 and entering the agreement is always growing 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:54.280
 the woman who was Maya who most sought not a goal woke up my being 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.280
 highly stressed organizer 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.950
 it was not much bigger said 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.590
 Surgeries - I love it 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.460
 I already expected for example server is not a liposuction surgery 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.370
 It's not from our area. 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.160
 but she is so today she lota hospitals in the month of July ago lusa the parents a 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.649
 majority placed 

00:02:12.649 --> 00:02:15.649
 in that game today but has been delayed celestial beings 

00:02:16.249 --> 00:02:20.109
 nor so much but I was operated natal paranaense charada mafra for the ten and 

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:21.389
 mid-morning 

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:25.229
 and almost did not get here so much surgery and sessions a day 

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:30.059
 there is more we do little more to do it deserves to be seen week 

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:32.650
 Our group does fourteen a week. 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.979
 I'm talking like that outside 

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:39.189
 the usp group the opera a lot because they are 4 wizards injury 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:43.639
 twelve individuals being trained par excellence that work in the usp and in 

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:47.069
 florian holder the chilean regional puyehue just there léo 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.469
 focus on teaching 

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:53.299
 so obviously what to think about what is involved in surgery teaching 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:57.239
 but the surgery the same same things 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.090
 the closed collection daycare center was a training and otorrino for power 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.169
 pick up functional part of the sefaz 

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:05.819
 and then he did the training in the long 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.169
 for cosmetic surgery for the two cups that is a dream of humanity 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.619
 then there is face surgery 

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:15.439
 was divided into two realities 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:18.909
 and this is not good let's give the example of the nose that is the center 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:23.299
 then the nose if you are to operate and it looks beautiful but clogged 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:25.499
 not worth 

00:03:25.499 --> 00:03:29.499
 is then first there is a functional training for anika to preach the 

00:03:29.499 --> 00:03:30.949
 correct deviations 

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:32.469
 Why do they ask? 

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:36.620
 and then one learns the aesthetic part for social two things for example the 

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:38.419
 nose surgery 

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:42.889
 there were two other specialties that took care of this area one taking care of the 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:44.209
 functional part 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:45.539
 and one of the part 

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:47.019
 outside the aesthetics 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.860
 imagine a money that makes the pet or land does on the walls but none 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:53.319
 treated saber will get crooked 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:55.739
 And then we dreamed of doing 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.049
 to draw a professional that tvs this global training 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:02.249
 As in Brazil the plastics are very good. 

00:04:02.249 --> 00:04:03.839
 we are very proud 

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:06.369
 of Easter that we have the general practice 

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:09.659
 it's probably going to be easy this thing is easy 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:12.629
 because others also have good level here 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:14.869
 The American is already a little ahead 

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:16.419
 he can already join 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.519
 and 100 reais professional phase because the gialorossi states front 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.240
 because the Brazilian experts are good wines 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.710
 first because I took out surgeries 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.110
 just say it 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.559
 keats at the end of a three year residency here in Brazil in the tournament 

00:04:31.559 --> 00:04:35.449
 can do two thousand surgeries while five years in europe he does two or 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:36.629
 three 

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:39.360
 then how is a born natural climate? 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.099
 it is still surgery 

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:44.659
 who changes a lot will develop his great manual skill 

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:49.749
 and Brazil is good at it people are looking for you more to do what the eye 

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:50.940
 nose today 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.340
 maybe because we were referring to the weather 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.919
 the nose today is the oe the great demand 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:59.360
 the eastern zone has to be much more likely to have had 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:03.630
 sure the phone price on the icon as soon as 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:05.930
 brazil design in the whole world, right? 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.180
 a creature rafa benítez that a wonderful people person sectional 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.740
 with a turban where you wake up 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.300
 cultures generate history of medicine on the paycheck 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:21.000
 spent much more time talking about the philosophy of what surgeries are 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.509
 human being lives the spirit 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:27.419
 and then the nose loves it because it's the front bumper of the ride 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:29.279
 and it's here 

00:05:29.279 --> 00:05:33.169
 this whole miscegenation that we have here, thanks to God, is a very 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:36.099
 mixed this is very good genetically 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:39.770
 try to understand and apocal full different nose everyone so 

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:44.770
 everyone represented here in Brazil will consult the Marizão of the Italian 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.489
 of the German exterminated screen on the one hand has our Afrodescendant 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:53.740
 the mix of everything and there there I think the children do not lie down and roll because 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:55.849
 he will have all the representation here 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:05:59.580
 easy this is the first part of the interview with the doctor to forgive 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.050
 beer is paulo 

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:02.020
 one of the great 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.419
 specialists in facial plastic surgery 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:05.449
 ae
