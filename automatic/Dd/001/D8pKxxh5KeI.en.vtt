it's gonna give the ball a path to roll
down<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:14.220> can<00:01:14.400> use<00:01:14.549> gravity<00:01:14.790> more<00:01:15.150> to

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
down and you can use gravity more to

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
down and you can use gravity more to
your<00:01:15.450> advantage<00:01:15.689> it<00:01:15.840> can<00:01:15.960> be<00:01:16.020> harder<00:01:16.259> to

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
your advantage it can be harder to

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.200 
your advantage it can be harder to
actually<00:01:16.680> roll<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.040> ball<00:01:17.220> up<00:01:17.250> your<00:01:17.549> back<00:01:17.759> if

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
actually roll the ball up your back if

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.789 
actually roll the ball up your back if
you<00:01:18.270> bend<00:01:18.540> down<00:01:18.659> it'll<00:01:19.229> come<00:01:19.409> down<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.590> little

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
you bend down it'll come down a little

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.830 
you bend down it'll come down a little
bit<00:01:19.950> easier<00:01:20.280> for<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:20.729> so<00:01:20.939> roll<00:01:21.630> it<00:01:21.659> around

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
bit easier for you so roll it around

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.090 
bit easier for you so roll it around
roll<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.590> back

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
roll it back

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.830 
roll it back
catch<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.610> behind<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.970> back<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.420> roll<00:01:24.720> it

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
catch it behind the back and roll it

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.590 
catch it behind the back and roll it
back<00:01:25.020> up<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.650> back<00:01:25.830> hence<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.850> name<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.390> back

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
back up the back hence the name the back

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.969 
back up the back hence the name the back
roll<00:01:27.900> up<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.259> then<00:01:28.380> after<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.680> get<00:01:28.799> it<00:01:28.890> down

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
roll up and then after you get it down

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.020 
roll up and then after you get it down
you<00:01:29.040> know<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.369> can<00:01:29.460> get<00:01:29.579> it<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.700> little<00:01:29.850> bit
