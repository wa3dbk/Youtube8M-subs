speakers or design or thought to make it
stronger<00:01:08.790> or<00:01:09.210> steady<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.860> does<00:01:11.070> it

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
stronger or steady and it does it

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.520 
stronger or steady and it does it
actually<00:01:12.030> does<00:01:12.420> you<00:01:12.570> can<00:01:12.720> see<00:01:12.930> that<00:01:13.110> it's<00:01:13.290> a

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
actually does you can see that it's a

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.080 
actually does you can see that it's a
very<00:01:13.860> very<00:01:14.490> interesting<00:01:14.729> valve<00:01:15.689> speakers

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
very very interesting valve speakers

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.880 
very very interesting valve speakers
something<00:01:18.090> different<00:01:18.869> as<00:01:19.049> well<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.500> the

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
something different as well is the

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.660 
something different as well is the
tweeter<00:01:20.880> with<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:22.020> shape<00:01:22.290> here<00:01:22.650> that<00:01:23.310> was

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
tweeter with this shape here that was

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.179 
tweeter with this shape here that was
designed<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.420> make<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.200> sound<00:01:25.560> between<00:01:25.799> the

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
designed to make the sound between the

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.730 
designed to make the sound between the
tweeter<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.850> this<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.479> woofer<00:01:27.810> nonlinear

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
tweeter and this the woofer nonlinear

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.450 
tweeter and this the woofer nonlinear
and<00:01:29.240> actually<00:01:30.240> it's<00:01:31.079> difficult<00:01:31.680> for<00:01:31.740> me<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:31.890> to

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
and actually it's difficult for me to to

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.880 
and actually it's difficult for me to to
explain<00:01:33.119> in<00:01:33.450> terms<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.049> technical<00:01:34.439> terms<00:01:34.650> but

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
explain in terms and technical terms but

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.370 
explain in terms and technical terms but
I<00:01:34.950> can<00:01:35.189> say<00:01:35.460> I<00:01:35.700> like<00:01:36.479> music<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.049> I<00:01:37.110> play<00:01:37.140> the

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
I can say I like music and I play the

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.230 
I can say I like music and I play the
guitar<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:37.890> what<00:01:38.130> I<00:01:38.400> can<00:01:38.520> say<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:38.939> and

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
guitar and what I can say is and

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.990 
guitar and what I can say is and
actually<00:01:39.689> what<00:01:40.049> that's<00:01:40.710> what<00:01:41.040> matter<00:01:41.729> the

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
actually what that's what matter the

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.710
