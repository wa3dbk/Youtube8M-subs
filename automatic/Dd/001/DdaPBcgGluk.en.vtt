00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:06.990
 Hello Larissa members of the word and 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.710
 today we will talk about how 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:15.690
 shortening the person so that stayed with 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:19.650
 us saved this edge here i 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.689
 conscientiously looked on youtube 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.880
 people say about this because 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.720
 don't wanna copy no offend anyone 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:31.740
 or want someone dear and all 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.140
 recommendations comes down to what started 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.940
 summary 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.670
 cut off need tanks well that's how it is 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.739
 all this must be cunningly taken into account 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.670
 for beginners, this is probably a little bit 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.129
 problematic 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.840
 i do the same with exactly the same 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.030
 the end result is only much 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:53.340
 easier and easier and now I will show you how 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.350
 means no remove means first we 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.140
 do it like we measure marry yourself 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.140
 or on the cat man we measure how much 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:07.290
 centimeters we have the excess I'm here for 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:11.939
 greater effect beat off 10 usually so 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:17.299
 not much less than to shorten Now let 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.299
 it will be like this and that means we draw lines 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:25.150
 I really pay attention to me from the edge 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:30.380
 but from here the weight ends the turn 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:34.400
 from here 10 centimeters midpoint less 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:41.120
 in general, it turns out 5 and 5 from this buzz 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:43.570
 no, this is 5 and 5 painted usual 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:47.270
 ballpoint pen to be seen 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:52.090
 that's all in the ring 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:54.190
 Here we spend here such a decree later 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:57.140
 do it like this 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.410
 we bend in the middle line along this one 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.410
 here 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:06.080
 we bend it like this 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:11.510
 hand of course this edge is better 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:16.700
 iron and cut with pins or 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:21.380
 if you want sweep again can 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:24.350
 be I already said but I repeat it 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.390
 after all, only non- nanotechnology jeans 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.300
 I don't urge people to do 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:33.060
 carelessly and defective 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:36.510
 just do not complex because of the thread 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.990
 this is also not worth skalyvala 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:43.500
 pins draw attention to 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:46.560
 the combination went so that they do not have 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.660
 Vadik slid against another but 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.120
 different parts but here in the same way and 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.460
 pins on such a vertical not here 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.150
 so that's better to have it fixed 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:03:02.210
 gaps and plot the line 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.210
 stitching here next to the podkin 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:12.709
 neatly evenly when pulled off 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:15.290
 one another prune cherries approximately 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.659
 centimeter and a half depending on what you will 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.459
 process 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:20.689
 best to have a good place here 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:25.989
 overlock foot 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:31.840
 or cars zigzag see for yourself 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:35.569
 we cut off the excess and then all this business 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:38.060
 we wrap it here so we 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:40.849
 looks too which is fucking here with us 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:44.959
 left left here are participants 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:48.319
 marks overlap can be repeated 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:55.239
 overlock can be sexo con possible in manual 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:55.239
 if there is no car you don't want to manually 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.689
 cars special cute then sorry by 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:03.409
 otkadki do not want to manually 

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:05.750
 respectively here on this edge 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:08.569
 quietly somewhere around about a millimeter 3 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.549
 you can put another regular line 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:14.090
 edges we have a little patrick 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:19.010
 its she again return to our tag 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:20.780
 that itâ€™s just jeans and even 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:24.639
 here you will be hanging around some 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:27.789
 strings the world from this will not turn over 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:27.789
 that's 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:35.850
 then pick up the thread as much as possible in tone 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:38.580
 regular thread number 40 thin but 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.540
 most similar in color to this large 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.610
 plan shooting 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.370
 she seems to be his place 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.250
 almost invisible and here on 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:49.440
 mm at 2 from the edge 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.000
 under scribble in order for it not to have 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:57.950
 dangled so that it was fixed 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:05:00.210
 exactly up till here there was no turning and 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:06.110
 do fasten gone 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:08.550
 right here on the width of this strip 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.960
 We make such small per click points too 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.590
 to hold well to avoid 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:17.670
 I turned away was discomfort here 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:20.790
 here is a squad and everything and this is ours 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:24.060
 the finished result is very simple easy 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:28.560
 anyone who has a car without 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:30.420
 no special knowledge without any 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.870
 cleverly wise advice from maybe this 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:39.060
 do any moment nothing to anyone 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:41.330
 pay now don't run like that good luck 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.330
 you
