00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
well in this case actually probably

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.080 
well in this case actually probably
about<00:00:18.840> 15<00:00:19.289> or<00:00:19.560> more<00:00:20.250> of<00:00:20.400> you<00:00:20.520> have<00:00:20.609> asked<00:00:20.939> for

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
about 15 or more of you have asked for

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.759 
about 15 or more of you have asked for
it<00:00:21.270> since<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.660> beginning<00:00:21.900> of<00:00:22.020> this<00:00:22.170> year<00:00:22.439> so

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
it since the beginning of this year so

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.529 
it since the beginning of this year so
it's<00:00:23.130> about<00:00:23.250> time<00:00:23.490> I<00:00:23.519> do<00:00:23.670> it<00:00:24.000> so<00:00:24.180> I<00:00:24.210> do<00:00:24.330> have

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
it's about time I do it so I do have

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.870 
it's about time I do it so I do have
three<00:00:24.750> max<00:00:25.109> level<00:00:25.320> characters<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.279> I<00:00:26.490> think

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
three max level characters and I think

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.670 
three max level characters and I think
if<00:00:27.000> you<00:00:27.119> haven't<00:00:27.390> rolled<00:00:27.599> an<00:00:27.750> alt<00:00:27.960> yet<00:00:28.230> you

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
if you haven't rolled an alt yet you

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.769 
if you haven't rolled an alt yet you
really<00:00:28.949> should<00:00:29.310> it<00:00:29.490> adds<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:30.029> lot<00:00:30.240> to<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.539> game

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779
