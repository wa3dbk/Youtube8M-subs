amp is right around 7 watts total now
the<00:05:06.880> th<00:05:07.120> 30<00:05:07.570> is<00:05:07.900> a<00:05:07.960> great<00:05:08.290> amp<00:05:08.500> I<00:05:08.680> found<00:05:08.860> it

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:08.979 
the th 30 is a great amp I found it

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:10.230 
the th 30 is a great amp I found it
really<00:05:09.070> hard<00:05:09.220> to<00:05:09.460> find<00:05:09.580> anything<00:05:09.910> about<00:05:10.030> it

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
really hard to find anything about it

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.110 
really hard to find anything about it
that<00:05:10.360> I<00:05:10.449> didn't<00:05:10.810> like<00:05:11.400> the<00:05:12.400> one<00:05:12.669> thing<00:05:12.910> that<00:05:13.090> I

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
that I didn't like the one thing that I

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.090 
that I didn't like the one thing that I
had<00:05:13.330> kind<00:05:13.510> of<00:05:13.600> a<00:05:13.690> qualms<00:05:13.930> with<00:05:14.139> was<00:05:14.410> the<00:05:14.770> volume

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.100 
had kind of a qualms with was the volume

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.760 
had kind of a qualms with was the volume
balancing<00:05:15.669> you<00:05:16.479> really<00:05:16.930> really<00:05:17.290> really<00:05:17.590> have

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
balancing you really really really have

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.710 
balancing you really really really have
to<00:05:17.800> push<00:05:18.160> the<00:05:18.400> master<00:05:19.000> volume<00:05:19.180> on<00:05:19.389> the<00:05:19.510> dirty

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
to push the master volume on the dirty

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:21.810 
to push the master volume on the dirty
channel<00:05:20.320> to<00:05:20.590> match<00:05:21.010> the<00:05:21.280> same<00:05:21.490> amount<00:05:21.760> of

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820 
channel to match the same amount of

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:23.820 
channel to match the same amount of
volume<00:05:21.880> and<00:05:22.270> punch<00:05:22.600> as<00:05:22.870> the<00:05:23.200> clean<00:05:23.410> channel

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
volume and punch as the clean channel

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.350 
volume and punch as the clean channel
and<00:05:24.490> that<00:05:24.580> kind<00:05:24.700> of<00:05:24.790> have<00:05:24.880> something<00:05:25.090> to<00:05:25.270> do

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
and that kind of have something to do

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.330 
and that kind of have something to do
with<00:05:25.510> with<00:05:25.930> the<00:05:26.110> different<00:05:26.410> voicing<00:05:26.889> and<00:05:27.250> the

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340 
with with the different voicing and the

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.790 
with with the different voicing and the
clean<00:05:27.550> channel<00:05:27.910> is<00:05:28.030> very<00:05:28.360> it's<00:05:29.260> it's<00:05:29.560> very

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
clean channel is very it's it's very

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.770 
clean channel is very it's it's very
differently<00:05:30.370> voiced<00:05:30.639> so<00:05:31.210> you<00:05:31.270> can<00:05:31.389> see<00:05:31.570> here

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
differently voiced so you can see here

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.180 
differently voiced so you can see here
on<00:05:31.930> the<00:05:32.020> clean<00:05:32.200> channel<00:05:32.500> volume<00:05:32.770> I<00:05:32.860> have<00:05:32.889> it<00:05:33.100> at

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
on the clean channel volume I have it at

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:34.830 
on the clean channel volume I have it at
about<00:05:33.370> 9:30<00:05:33.880> 9<00:05:34.210> o'clock

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
around there in order to get the same

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:38.730 
around there in order to get the same
amount<00:05:37.360> of<00:05:37.479> volume<00:05:37.840> and<00:05:37.960> punch<00:05:38.229> out<00:05:38.530> of<00:05:38.680> the

amount of volume and punch out of the
dirty<00:05:38.979> channel<00:05:39.520> I<00:05:39.639> had<00:05:39.789> to<00:05:39.910> have<00:05:40.060> it<00:05:40.090> pushed<00:05:40.510> up

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
dirty channel I had to have it pushed up

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:43.680 
dirty channel I had to have it pushed up
to<00:05:40.810> about<00:05:40.960> 12:30<00:05:41.620> or<00:05:41.710> 1:00<00:05:42.270> if<00:05:43.270> I<00:05:43.389> wanted<00:05:43.630> to

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690 
to about 12:30 or 1:00 if I wanted to

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.810 
to about 12:30 or 1:00 if I wanted to
have<00:05:43.900> it<00:05:44.080> go<00:05:44.350> a<00:05:44.380> little<00:05:44.740> bit<00:05:45.039> over<00:05:45.460> the<00:05:45.580> clean

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:45.820 
have it go a little bit over the clean

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.279 
have it go a little bit over the clean
channel<00:05:46.210> I<00:05:46.270> had<00:05:46.419> to<00:05:46.510> have<00:05:46.660> it<00:05:46.690> cranked<00:05:47.110> up<00:05:47.169> to

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:47.289 
channel I had to have it cranked up to

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:51.330 
channel I had to have it cranked up to
about<00:05:47.500> 2<00:05:47.740> o'clock<00:05:49.710> with<00:05:50.710> a<00:05:50.740> clean<00:05:51.160> channel

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:51.340 
about 2 o'clock with a clean channel

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.090 
about 2 o'clock with a clean channel
volume<00:05:51.610> in<00:05:51.910> that<00:05:51.940> position<00:05:52.300> now<00:05:52.800> this<00:05:53.800> isn't

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:54.100 
volume in that position now this isn't

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.800 
volume in that position now this isn't
some<00:05:54.310> so<00:05:54.910> much<00:05:55.060> of<00:05:55.180> a<00:05:55.240> detriment<00:05:55.750> because

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:55.810 
some so much of a detriment because

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.110 
some so much of a detriment because
orange<00:05:56.289> was<00:05:56.560> was<00:05:57.130> good<00:05:57.490> enough<00:05:57.669> to<00:05:57.729> include

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:58.120 
orange was was good enough to include

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.330 
orange was was good enough to include
separate<00:05:58.660> volumes<00:05:59.080> for<00:05:59.320> each<00:05:59.470> channel<00:06:00.070> so<00:06:00.280> you

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:00.340 
separate volumes for each channel so you

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.219 
separate volumes for each channel so you
could<00:06:00.700> balance<00:06:01.000> the<00:06:01.270> volume<00:06:01.720> in<00:06:01.840> between

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:02.229 
could balance the volume in between

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:05.610 
could balance the volume in between
between<00:06:02.740> the<00:06:02.979> two<00:06:03.660> other<00:06:04.660> than<00:06:04.900> that<00:06:05.110> the<00:06:05.470> amp

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:05.620 
between the two other than that the amp

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:09.360 
between the two other than that the amp
is<00:06:05.919> just<00:06:06.910> sounds<00:06:07.599> and<00:06:07.840> feels<00:06:08.020> great<00:06:08.740> play<00:06:09.070> so
