which<00:06:29.959> is<00:06:30.619> still<00:06:30.919> debatable<00:06:31.279> whether<00:06:31.429> there's

00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:31.759 
which is still debatable whether there's

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:34.059 
which is still debatable whether there's
actually<00:06:32.029> chocolate<00:06:32.209> or<00:06:32.539> shake<00:06:32.749> in<00:06:32.899> there<00:06:33.080> and

you just poured vodka in there I think
you<00:06:36.289> did<00:06:36.469> a<00:06:36.499> lot<00:06:36.830> of<00:06:36.979> that<00:06:37.069> same<00:06:37.309> taste<00:06:38.179> such
