um<00:00:02.389> well<00:00:03.389> here's<00:00:04.230> a<00:00:04.290> fight<00:00:04.560> going<00:00:05.069> on<00:00:05.250> at<00:00:05.460> 17<00:00:05.850> 11

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
um well here's a fight going on at 17 11

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.580 
um well here's a fight going on at 17 11
12<00:00:07.140> 13<00:00:08.179> 14<00:00:09.179> really<00:00:09.719> getting<00:00:09.990> a<00:00:10.019> lot<00:00:10.050> of<00:00:10.200> use<00:00:10.410> out

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
12 13 14 really getting a lot of use out

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.499 
12 13 14 really getting a lot of use out
of<00:00:10.650> that<00:00:10.769> combo<00:00:11.280> flamer<00:00:11.550> but<00:00:11.910> it's<00:00:12.090> not<00:00:12.240> doing

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
of that combo flamer but it's not doing

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.780 
of that combo flamer but it's not doing
anything<00:00:12.719> because<00:00:13.500> people<00:00:14.130> typically<00:00:14.490> just

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
anything because people typically just

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.310 
anything because people typically just
retreat<00:00:15.120> once<00:00:15.299> he<00:00:15.450> shoots<00:00:15.690> at<00:00:15.809> a<00:00:15.900> time<00:00:16.049> so<00:00:16.199> he

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
retreat once he shoots at a time so he

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.200 
retreat once he shoots at a time so he
needs<00:00:16.440> to<00:00:16.710> save<00:00:16.980> that<00:00:17.220> I<00:00:17.279> think<00:00:17.760> for<00:00:18.000> fights

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
needs to save that I think for fights

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.760 
needs to save that I think for fights
that<00:00:18.390> are<00:00:18.449> much<00:00:18.690> more<00:00:18.840> crucial<00:00:19.260> he<00:00:19.410> seems<00:00:19.650> to

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
that are much more crucial he seems to

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.950 
that are much more crucial he seems to
be<00:00:19.890> using<00:00:20.039> it<00:00:20.220> as<00:00:20.340> an<00:00:20.520> opener<00:00:20.880> or<00:00:21.060> something<00:00:21.840> or

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
be using it as an opener or something or

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.519 
be using it as an opener or something or
even<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.260> midler<00:00:22.680> in<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:23.279> fight<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:24.330> then<00:00:25.289> the

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.859 
even a midler in the fight and then the
fight<00:00:25.710> just<00:00:25.920> ends<00:00:26.330> what<00:00:27.330> he<00:00:27.480> wants<00:00:27.689> to<00:00:27.720> do<00:00:27.840> is

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
that set up and really needs to stay set

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.789 
that set up and really needs to stay set
up<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.450> i<00:01:36.479> guess<00:01:36.810> these<00:01:36.960> people<00:01:37.590> who<00:01:37.710> are

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
up so i guess these people who are

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.319 
up so i guess these people who are
worshiping<00:01:38.280> do<00:01:38.460> something<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.030> people<00:01:39.119> who

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
get close to them because now these

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.749 
get close to them because now these
bloodletters<00:01:40.860> who<00:01:41.070> are<00:01:41.189> close<00:01:41.369> have<00:01:41.579> this

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
mark of corn or mark of oh no maybe this

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.550 
mark of corn or mark of oh no maybe this
is<00:01:45.240> a<00:01:45.270> Chinese<00:01:45.570> symbol<00:01:45.869> for<00:01:45.899> peace<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.229> love

i don't think the entire galaxy is going

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.440 
i don't think the entire galaxy is going
to<00:03:59.340> burn<00:03:59.459> but<00:03:59.700> you<00:03:59.760> figure<00:04:00.060> it's<00:04:00.180> probably

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
to burn but you figure it's probably

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:01.849 
to burn but you figure it's probably
good<00:04:00.630> so<00:04:00.780> you<00:04:00.870> buy<00:04:01.049> it<00:04:01.109> anyways<00:04:01.470> and<00:04:01.500> that

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:01.859 
good so you buy it anyways and that

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:03.920 
good so you buy it anyways and that
might<00:04:02.040> actually<00:04:02.190> be<00:04:02.519> the<00:04:03.120> flame<00:04:03.630> thing<00:04:03.810> that

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
might actually be the flame thing that

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.420 
might actually be the flame thing that
we've<00:04:04.079> been<00:04:04.260> seeing<00:04:04.440> the<00:04:04.560> entire<00:04:04.799> time<00:04:05.010> maybe

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
we've been seeing the entire time maybe

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.039 
we've been seeing the entire time maybe
not<00:04:05.609> even<00:04:05.640> from<00:04:05.970> the<00:04:06.030> combat<00:04:06.329> flamer<00:04:06.510> in<00:04:06.930> which

not even from the combat flamer in which

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:08.840 
not even from the combat flamer in which
case<00:04:07.200> i<00:04:07.350> would<00:04:07.470> say<00:04:07.650> the<00:04:07.980> company<00:04:08.430> was<00:04:08.609> useless

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
case i would say the company was useless

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:09.979 
case i would say the company was useless
if<00:04:09.090> there's<00:04:09.239> no<00:04:09.329> other<00:04:09.390> things<00:04:09.660> shooting<00:04:09.900> at

if there's no other things shooting at

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.180 
if there's no other things shooting at
those<00:04:10.109> fireballs<00:04:10.470> because<00:04:10.680> he<00:04:10.829> really<00:04:11.070> hasn't

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
those fireballs because he really hasn't

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.199 
those fireballs because he really hasn't
used<00:04:11.370> it<00:04:11.489> for<00:04:11.670> anything<00:04:11.820> else<00:04:12.000> and<00:04:12.120> I'm

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
used it for anything else and I'm

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:13.940 
used it for anything else and I'm
guessing<00:04:12.570> he's<00:04:13.320> been<00:04:13.470> using<00:04:13.680> it<00:04:13.769> for<00:04:13.799> the

guessing he's been using it for the
fireball<00:04:14.310> I<00:04:14.459> don't<00:04:14.609> know<00:04:14.700> what<00:04:14.880> let<00:04:15.120> the
