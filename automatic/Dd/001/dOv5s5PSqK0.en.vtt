00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:23.649
 Are you also of the opinion that the 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.840

 explore my limits 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.369
 but they lack as parents through the 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.680
 Double burden of household and work 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:45.640

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.159
 child 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:03.530
 It is not a party environmental organization 

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:06.740

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.390
 easy for nature adventure fun 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.090
 that's the whole thing 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.489
 Philosophy explains we move in 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.030
 The outdoors experience adventure and adventure 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:19.519
 have a lot of fun ms 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.959
 experiential education was launched in the summer of 2005 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:28.879
 by bernd rÃ¶der in eppstein im taunus 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:30.950
 founded by the adventure teacher harald 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:34.250
 bait is also state certified and 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.500
 certified forest educator sense and 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.690
 The purpose of Enr was and is today 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.970
 children next to a tightly organized 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.950
 School life again the opportunity to 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.620
 give free and carefree in the 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.030
 to move nature 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.010
 For the children, what counts is not the measurable one 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.019
 achievement or perfection as you 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.879
 Above all, sport is required but 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.879
 only the fun of the movement is important 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.040
 Adventure should not just be virtual 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:04.580
 but experienced close up on your own body 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.230
 will have to act out of their own 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.940
 the children safe consequences 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.220
 experience as well as strengthen and weaken 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.480
 recognize responsibility for yourself 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.430
 and others in the group 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:18.610
 are just as important aspects as that 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:20.300
 Collaboration takes him by it 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.100
 experiential education is not 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.870
 around a high ropes course or adventure 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.670
 park but by the use of 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.800
 mobile elements will be the existing ones 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.750

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.280

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.380
 Of course this is a very high measure 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.940
 the safety ahead of responsibility 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:37.150
 the participant and environmental protection 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.410
 have the highest priority 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.240
 so every event gets one 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.040
 certain uniqueness and the children 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.350
