something<00:01:13.700> that<00:01:13.880> I've<00:01:14.030> talked<00:01:14.750> about<00:01:14.840> in<00:01:14.990> my

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
something that I've talked about in my

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:16.960 
something that I've talked about in my
workshops<00:01:15.620> over<00:01:15.980> the<00:01:16.100> years<00:01:16.340> it's<00:01:16.580> basically

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
workshops over the years it's basically

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.970 
workshops over the years it's basically
I<00:01:17.090> call<00:01:17.390> this<00:01:17.540> the<00:01:17.600> four<00:01:17.990> reasons<00:01:18.260> that<00:01:18.710> people

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:18.980 
I call this the four reasons that people

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.760 
I call this the four reasons that people
create<00:01:19.700> now<00:01:20.510> different<00:01:20.840> people<00:01:20.870> experience

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
create now different people experience

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.730 
create now different people experience
these<00:01:21.920> for<00:01:22.250> different<00:01:22.640> reasons<00:01:23.090> in<00:01:23.740> different

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
these for different reasons in different

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.010 
these for different reasons in different
ways<00:01:24.980> but<00:01:25.310> for<00:01:25.340> the<00:01:25.550> most<00:01:25.880> part<00:01:26.390> I<00:01:26.570> think<00:01:26.600> this

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
ways but for the most part I think this

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.990 
ways but for the most part I think this
is<00:01:27.170> the<00:01:27.290> canalla<00:01:27.770> G<00:01:28.040> that<00:01:28.190> most<00:01:28.400> people<00:01:28.700> go

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
is the canalla G that most people go

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.900 
is the canalla G that most people go
through<00:01:29.270> when<00:01:29.660> they<00:01:30.320> are<00:01:30.560> inspired<00:01:31.550> to

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:31.910 
through when they are inspired to

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.300 
through when they are inspired to
express<00:01:32.420> themselves<00:01:32.960> in<00:01:33.260> some<00:01:33.560> creative<00:01:34.100> way

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
express themselves in some creative way

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.400 
express themselves in some creative way
so<00:01:34.700> the<00:01:34.820> first<00:01:35.030> reason<00:01:35.300> that<00:01:35.510> we<00:01:35.720> often<00:01:36.140> play

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.410 
so the first reason that we often play

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:41.170 
so the first reason that we often play
music<00:01:37.220> or<00:01:37.460> learn<00:01:38.000> to<00:01:38.360> a<00:01:38.810> write<00:01:39.410> or<00:01:39.740> do<00:01:40.160> art<00:01:40.520> or

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
music or learn to a write or do art or

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.260 
music or learn to a write or do art or
act<00:01:41.840> or<00:01:42.260> whatever<00:01:42.770> usually<00:01:43.580> for<00:01:43.760> personal

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
act or whatever usually for personal

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.600 
act or whatever usually for personal
satisfactions<00:01:45.200> like<00:01:45.380> you<00:01:45.710> set<00:01:45.980> a<00:01:46.010> goal<00:01:46.280> or<00:01:46.520> you

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
satisfactions like you set a goal or you

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.130 
satisfactions like you set a goal or you

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
or validation and this is the good

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.680 
or validation and this is the good

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
feeling that comes when someone

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130 
to eat pizza and watch movies because it

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:47.620 
to eat pizza and watch movies because it
doesn't<00:05:46.400> cater<00:05:46.640> to<00:05:46.910> a<00:05:46.940> need<00:05:47.210> in<00:05:47.360> the<00:05:47.450> world

that<00:05:47.840> people<00:05:48.110> are<00:05:48.230> willing<00:05:48.410> to<00:05:48.650> pay<00:05:49.040> for<00:05:49.070> but

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:49.880 
that people are willing to pay for but

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:50.950 
that people are willing to pay for but
if<00:05:50.000> you<00:05:50.090> could<00:05:50.240> figure<00:05:50.450> out<00:05:50.660> what<00:05:50.810> that

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 
if you could figure out what that

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.380 
if you could figure out what that
overlap<00:05:51.500> is<00:05:51.530> and<00:05:52.040> presented<00:05:52.460> to<00:05:52.580> them<00:05:52.760> in<00:05:52.970> the

overlap is and presented to them in the

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:55.480 
overlap is and presented to them in the
right<00:05:53.630> way<00:05:53.990> then<00:05:54.650> the<00:05:54.800> money<00:05:54.980> has<00:05:55.160> a<00:05:55.190> much

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.490 
right way then the money has a much

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.730 
right way then the money has a much
better<00:05:55.700> chance<00:05:55.820> of<00:05:56.240> flowing<00:05:56.750> to<00:05:56.960> you<00:05:57.169> and<00:05:57.620> from

00:05:57.730 --> 00:05:57.740 
better chance of flowing to you and from

00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.320 
better chance of flowing to you and from
my<00:05:57.890> perspective<00:05:58.190> it's<00:05:58.580> all<00:05:58.730> centered<00:05:59.240> around

00:05:59.320 --> 00:05:59.330 
my perspective it's all centered around

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.200 
my perspective it's all centered around
that<00:05:59.900> benefit<00:06:00.590> that<00:06:00.800> you<00:06:01.310> offer<00:06:01.610> to<00:06:01.850> people

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.210 
that benefit that you offer to people

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.780 
that benefit that you offer to people
how<00:06:02.570> does<00:06:02.630> your<00:06:02.900> art<00:06:03.169> touch<00:06:03.710> people<00:06:04.340> how<00:06:04.669> can

the process
so<00:06:13.669> in<00:06:13.760> upcoming<00:06:13.970> videos<00:06:14.120> we'll<00:06:14.630> get<00:06:14.750> a<00:06:14.780> little

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:14.990 
so in upcoming videos we'll get a little

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:16.750 
so in upcoming videos we'll get a little
bit<00:06:15.200> more<00:06:15.410> into<00:06:15.650> some<00:06:15.830> of<00:06:15.919> the<00:06:16.010> structure<00:06:16.550> of

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:16.760 
bit more into some of the structure of

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.730 
bit more into some of the structure of
that<00:06:17.120> but<00:06:17.360> I<00:06:17.419> just<00:06:17.570> had<00:06:17.750> to<00:06:17.780> lay<00:06:18.169> out<00:06:18.410> this

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:18.740 
that but I just had to lay out this

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.480 
that but I just had to lay out this
big-picture<00:06:19.580> view<00:06:19.880> of<00:06:20.630> making<00:06:21.380> money<00:06:21.770> with
