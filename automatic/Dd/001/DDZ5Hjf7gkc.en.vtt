00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.550

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.809
 proteins to vote this product then 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.570
 today I'm going to test the beta 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.680
 bodybuilding alanine of dogs 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.900
 burish is a brand we have 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.490
 mounted in collaboration between our site 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.320
 bodybuilding like and finesse 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.630
 shop a French brand that 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.939
 respect the standards haccp then the 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.260
 betanine is a product that helps 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.679
 reduce burns workouts and 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.780
 improve energy endurance here on 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.760
 is on plant cells that are 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.829
 dosed at 500 mg by jules it has us 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.620
 shocked ok knowing that betanin 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.660
 we will take between 1 and 3 g before 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.950
 every training center knowing 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.180
 also that the more you go up dosage 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.260
 the more you risk having 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.140
 tingling in the face 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.210
 so in terms of capsules the cells 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.410
 capsules of average size or even 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.699
 maybe small enough 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.890
 so that should not be a problem 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.690
 especially to swallow me but I 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.399
 just going to take four 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.230
 so to go up to 2 g 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.520
 and then we find ourselves just now 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:10.260
 at the gym takes the lead to 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:12.750
 shocks so first hot balance of 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.670
 betanine the beginning of the nations 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.740
 I was today on a meeting and 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.060
 paul cuisset especially on the shoulders 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.159
 I will a lot of aeration 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.330
 lateral with declining balance 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.280
 made a very very long dessert 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.740
 actually it's very surprising but 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.210
 I really had no burn even at 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.579
 end of my declining balance I really 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.840
 no burning on the shoulders so 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.250
 finally he was just stopped by the 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.299
 did I have more energy and not 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.189
 by the fact that I had a burn that 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.180
 kept me from finishing the exercise so 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.220
 quite positive 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.110
 So here I am in supplement or 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.310
 greatly reducing the burn but 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.050
 it allows you to push the exercise more 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.430
 far and above all to push it cleanly 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.540
 and not be bothered by the burn and 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.330
 really stop because a shot of 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.470
 What strength by effectively against the 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.030
 little tingling that shows a small 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.250
 little at first to ears and after on 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.210
 the front and that lasted maybe a 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.650
 half an hour or something like that 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.610
 like that it's a bit less 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:03.150
 so it looks good for the record of the 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.280
 delinquency is very effective for 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.050
 noise reduction and melting or 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.520
 others is on the other hand a small point 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.200
 negative that I just had 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.050
 tingling on the face and the Swiss to 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.930
 a tolerance but had to find 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:23.310
 my contract you need the ratio between the 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:25.290
 uv dose and guitar too annoying 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.690
 so it's up to you to see between between 1 and 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.310
 3 g before each training 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:36.560
 Management of your CDs to pass legislation 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:36.560
 for a destination of course
