00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
power button as you see here but still

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.210 
power button as you see here but still
holding<00:02:53.900> on<00:02:54.020> to<00:02:54.200> your<00:02:54.290> home<00:02:54.500> button<00:02:54.739> for<00:02:55.190> about

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
holding on to your home button for about

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.510 
holding on to your home button for about
a<00:02:55.820> couple<00:02:56.660> seconds<00:02:57.200> it'll<00:02:57.500> actually<00:02:58.100> there

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
a couple seconds it'll actually there

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.540 
a couple seconds it'll actually there
goes<00:02:58.780> so<00:02:59.780> once<00:03:00.290> that's<00:03:00.440> done<00:03:00.709> go<00:03:00.980> ahead<00:03:01.370> and

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
goes so once that's done go ahead and

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.070 
goes so once that's done go ahead and
let<00:03:01.880> it<00:03:01.910> run<00:03:02.209> its<00:03:02.590> exploiting<00:03:03.590> lime<00:03:04.160> rain<00:03:04.459> and

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
let it run its exploiting lime rain and

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.500 
let it run its exploiting lime rain and
this<00:03:06.080> will<00:03:06.470> take<00:03:07.010> a<00:03:07.070> couple<00:03:07.370> minutes<00:03:07.580> so<00:03:08.300> I'm

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
this will take a couple minutes so I'm

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.720 
this will take a couple minutes so I'm
going<00:03:08.660> to<00:03:08.720> fast<00:03:09.260> forward<00:03:09.350> this<00:03:09.590> video<00:03:09.860> so<00:03:10.640> we

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
going to fast forward this video so we

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:19.270 
going to fast forward this video so we
will<00:03:10.820> have<00:03:10.880> to<00:03:10.970> run<00:03:11.269> through<00:03:11.450> this

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.580 

I<00:03:21.130> guess<00:03:22.130> so<00:03:22.160> now<00:03:22.850> it's<00:03:23.240> booted<00:03:23.660> up<00:03:23.810> and<00:03:24.050> so

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
I guess so now it's booted up and so

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:30.699 
I guess so now it's booted up and so
we're<00:03:24.770> gonna<00:03:26.140> slide<00:03:27.140> to<00:03:27.410> unlock<00:03:28.330> and<00:03:29.560> if<00:03:30.560> you

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
we're gonna slide to unlock and if you

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.720 
we're gonna slide to unlock and if you
scroll<00:03:31.130> down<00:03:32.030> to<00:03:32.420> your<00:03:32.510> right<00:03:32.750> you<00:03:33.470> will<00:03:33.500> see

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
scroll down to your right you will see

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.240 
scroll down to your right you will see
Cydia<00:03:34.730> is<00:03:35.000> actually<00:03:35.630> white<00:03:36.200> there's<00:03:36.890> a<00:03:36.980> white

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
Cydia is actually white there's a white

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.070 
Cydia is actually white there's a white
icon<00:03:37.670> up<00:03:37.850> there<00:03:39.670> so<00:03:40.670> as<00:03:41.060> you<00:03:41.480> see<00:03:41.660> if<00:03:41.750> you<00:03:41.870> click

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:42.080 
icon up there so as you see if you click

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.510 
icon up there so as you see if you click
on<00:03:42.110> it<00:03:42.380> it<00:03:43.370> doesn't<00:03:43.700> load<00:03:43.910> up<00:03:45.160> same<00:03:46.160> with

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 
on it it doesn't load up same with

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:53.830 
on it it doesn't load up same with
Safari<00:03:48.880> it<00:03:49.880> closes<00:03:50.239> so<00:03:51.670> don't<00:03:52.670> panic<00:03:52.880> there

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
Safari it closes so don't panic there

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.960 
Safari it closes so don't panic there
it's<00:03:54.560> a<00:03:54.620> way<00:03:54.739> to<00:03:54.769> fix<00:03:55.010> that<00:03:55.220> that<00:03:55.670> you<00:03:55.760> still

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
it's a way to fix that that you still

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.290 
it's a way to fix that that you still
have<00:03:56.090> to<00:03:56.209> do<00:03:56.330> on<00:03:56.510> your<00:03:56.630> computer<00:03:57.070> so<00:03:58.300> what

we'll<00:03:59.450> have<00:03:59.480> to<00:03:59.570> do<00:03:59.810> now<00:04:00.050> is<00:04:00.080> go<00:04:00.709> back<00:04:00.890> to<00:04:00.950> read

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
we'll have to do now is go back to read

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.360 
we'll have to do now is go back to read

we're gonna turn off our iphone again or

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:40.000 
we're gonna turn off our iphone again or
your<00:04:32.930> whatever<00:04:33.440> your<00:04:33.820> jailbreaking<00:04:38.830> go<00:04:39.830> ahead

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
your whatever your jailbreaking go ahead

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:47.230 
your whatever your jailbreaking go ahead
turn<00:04:40.220> it<00:04:40.370> off<00:04:40.520> and<00:04:45.310> we<00:04:46.310> will<00:04:46.550> do<00:04:47.090> the<00:04:47.150> same

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
turn it off and we will do the same

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.760 
turn it off and we will do the same
process<00:04:47.840> like<00:04:48.080> what<00:04:48.260> we<00:04:48.410> did<00:04:48.560> with<00:04:48.740> the

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
process like what we did with the

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.850 
process like what we did with the
jailbreaking<00:04:49.750> so<00:04:50.750> this<00:04:51.140> is<00:04:51.169> what<00:04:51.470> you<00:04:51.590> have<00:04:51.620> to

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
jailbreaking so this is what you have to

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.210 
jailbreaking so this is what you have to
