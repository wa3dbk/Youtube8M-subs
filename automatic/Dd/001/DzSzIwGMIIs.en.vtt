him I think he's in the right
proportions<00:01:21.900> finally<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:22.530> think<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:23.009> he<00:01:23.189> just

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.420 
proportions finally I think that he just
looks<00:01:24.119> like<00:01:25.080> he<00:01:25.259> may<00:01:25.740> have<00:01:25.770> just<00:01:26.189> come<00:01:26.310> right

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
back articulation is great he has cog

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.009 
back articulation is great he has cog
joints<00:02:50.879> and<00:02:51.239> I<00:02:51.330> know<00:02:51.390> some<00:02:51.569> people<00:02:51.690> don't<00:02:51.810> care

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
joints and I know some people don't care

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:53.479 
joints and I know some people don't care
for<00:02:52.050> the<00:02:52.200> conduits<00:02:52.560> personally<00:02:52.980> I<00:02:53.010> think

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
for the conduits personally I think

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:54.890 
for the conduits personally I think
that's<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:53.760> best<00:02:53.940> and<00:02:54.209> he<00:02:54.269> also<00:02:54.390> has<00:02:54.660> some

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
that's the best and he also has some

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.540 
that's the best and he also has some
ball<00:02:55.110> joints<00:02:55.470> but<00:02:55.530> I<00:02:55.620> think<00:02:55.800> cog<00:02:56.040> is<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.340> best

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
ball joints but I think cog is the best

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:57.949 
ball joints but I think cog is the best
for<00:02:56.760> most<00:02:56.879> of<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:57.060> joints<00:02:57.390> for<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.599> arms<00:02:57.810> and

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
for most of the joints for the arms and

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.290 
for most of the joints for the arms and
stuff<00:02:58.129> head<00:02:59.129> can<00:02:59.340> clearly<00:02:59.610> look<00:02:59.819> up<00:02:59.970> and<00:03:00.150> down

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
stuff head can clearly look up and down

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.670 
stuff head can clearly look up and down
there<00:03:01.140> is<00:03:01.170> 360<00:03:02.069> arc<00:03:02.930> arms<00:03:03.930> can<00:03:04.110> open<00:03:04.379> up<00:03:04.470> pretty

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
there is 360 arc arms can open up pretty

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.440 
there is 360 arc arms can open up pretty
pretty<00:03:05.129> good<00:03:05.310> and<00:03:05.670> they<00:03:05.819> can<00:03:05.940> cross<00:03:06.180> over

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
pretty good and they can cross over

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.300 
pretty good and they can cross over
farther<00:03:07.170> than<00:03:07.319> they<00:03:07.440> could<00:03:07.620> previously<00:03:08.190> and

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
farther than they could previously and

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.759

you<00:03:18.930> have<00:03:19.489> the<00:03:20.489> joint<00:03:20.700> just<00:03:20.940> go<00:03:21.000> up<00:03:21.180> and<00:03:21.300> down

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
you have the joint just go up and down

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.509 
you have the joint just go up and down
you<00:03:22.110> know<00:03:22.140> just<00:03:22.230> it<00:03:22.590> was<00:03:22.800> rotating<00:03:23.040> like<00:03:23.459> a

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
you know just it was rotating like a

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.960 
you know just it was rotating like a
clock<00:03:23.730> but<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:24.840> just<00:03:25.799> below<00:03:25.920> that<00:03:26.069> the<00:03:26.700> next

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
clock but the just below that the next

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.250 
clock but the just below that the next
joint<00:03:27.120> there<00:03:27.360> is<00:03:27.510> actually<00:03:27.780> on<00:03:27.870> a<00:03:27.900> ball<00:03:28.080> joint

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
joint there is actually on a ball joint

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.750 
joint there is actually on a ball joint
so<00:03:28.470> you<00:03:28.530> do<00:03:28.920> get<00:03:29.069> a<00:03:29.099> little<00:03:29.220> bit<00:03:29.370> more<00:03:29.519> range

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
so you do get a little bit more range

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.369 
so you do get a little bit more range
and<00:03:30.000> then<00:03:30.120> the<00:03:30.180> knees<00:03:30.330> get<00:03:30.780> a<00:03:30.840> good<00:03:31.080> range<00:03:31.260> of

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:31.379 
and then the knees get a good range of

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:33.320 
and then the knees get a good range of
motion<00:03:31.580> then<00:03:32.580> the<00:03:32.819> various<00:03:33.090> points

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
motion then the various points

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.000 
motion then the various points
throughout<00:03:33.360> the<00:03:33.629> foot<00:03:33.900> and<00:03:34.080> the<00:03:34.349> toe<00:03:34.530> i<00:03:34.769> love

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
throughout the foot and the toe i love

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.430 
throughout the foot and the toe i love
the<00:03:35.129> toe<00:03:35.310> but<00:03:35.909> anyway<00:03:36.299> this<00:03:36.780> is<00:03:36.840> by<00:03:37.140> far<00:03:37.409> the

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
the toe but anyway this is by far the

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.410 
the toe but anyway this is by far the
best<00:03:37.830> chief<00:03:38.190> sculpt<00:03:38.549> they've<00:03:38.760> ever<00:03:38.940> done<00:03:39.090> i

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
best chief sculpt they've ever done i

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.789 
best chief sculpt they've ever done i
don't<00:03:39.569> think<00:03:39.750> they<00:03:39.840> could<00:03:39.900> do<00:03:40.230> one<00:03:40.409> better

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
don't think they could do one better

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.949 
don't think they could do one better
except<00:03:41.790> for<00:03:42.150> it<00:03:42.239> to<00:03:42.330> be<00:03:42.390> able<00:03:42.450> to<00:03:42.540> walk<00:03:42.750> and

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
except for it to be able to walk and

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.210 
except for it to be able to walk and
talk<00:03:43.110> i<00:03:43.319> think<00:03:43.349> i'd<00:03:43.590> be<00:03:43.650> the<00:03:43.739> only<00:03:43.890> other<00:03:44.010> thing

talk i think i'd be the only other thing
they<00:03:44.310> could<00:03:44.430> do<00:03:44.519> to<00:03:44.549> improve<00:03:44.670> this<00:03:45.060> thing<00:03:45.590> I've

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
they do in the reach line now but I the

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.469 
they do in the reach line now but I the
straight<00:04:24.520> years<00:04:24.669> great<00:04:24.880> I'm<00:04:25.180> gonna<00:04:25.300> give<00:04:25.419> him

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.379 
definitely a five out of five it's not
like<00:04:26.860> a<00:04:26.889> ten<00:04:27.160> out<00:04:27.310> of<00:04:27.340> five<00:04:27.580> because<00:04:28.240> I<00:04:28.270> think

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:28.389 
like a ten out of five because I think

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:30.180 
like a ten out of five because I think
he's<00:04:28.600> that<00:04:28.720> good<00:04:28.990> if<00:04:29.169> you<00:04:29.260> find<00:04:29.530> one<00:04:29.620> get<00:04:30.070> him

he's that good if you find one get him

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.469 
he's that good if you find one get him
because<00:04:30.430> he's<00:04:30.580> a<00:04:30.610> chase<00:04:30.910> figure<00:04:31.270> and<00:04:31.389> I<00:04:31.419> know

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:31.479 
because he's a chase figure and I know

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:32.900 
because he's a chase figure and I know
that<00:04:31.660> there's<00:04:31.810> only<00:04:31.870> one<00:04:32.139> of<00:04:32.229> these<00:04:32.290> per<00:04:32.560> case

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
that there's only one of these per case

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.170 
that there's only one of these per case
at<00:04:33.910> least<00:04:33.970> most<00:04:34.389> of<00:04:34.510> the<00:04:34.600> cases<00:04:34.810> so<00:04:35.580> he<00:04:36.580> won't

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
at least most of the cases so he won't

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.610 
at least most of the cases so he won't
be<00:04:37.330> as<00:04:37.449> available<00:04:37.990> as<00:04:38.080> like<00:04:38.320> the<00:04:38.440> Platinum
