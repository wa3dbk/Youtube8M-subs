00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
and plug the unit in when you actually

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.439 
and plug the unit in when you actually
want<00:03:39.810> your<00:03:40.109> ozone<00:03:40.260> generator<00:03:40.949> to<00:03:41.189> work<00:03:41.340> now<00:03:42.000> so

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:42.449 
want your ozone generator to work now so

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:44.059 
want your ozone generator to work now so
