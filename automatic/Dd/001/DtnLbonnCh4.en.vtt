00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.560 
its 22 fold now when you put it on the
bag<00:02:58.260> you<00:02:58.890> want<00:02:59.100> to<00:02:59.160> make<00:02:59.310> sure<00:02:59.340> it's<00:02:59.910> on<00:03:00.180> the

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
bag you want to make sure it's on the

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.280 
bag you want to make sure it's on the
top<00:03:00.950> like<00:03:01.950> that<00:03:02.000> so<00:03:03.000> basically<00:03:03.360> you<00:03:03.990> just<00:03:04.020> want

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
top like that so basically you just want

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.540 
top like that so basically you just want
to<00:03:04.500> like<00:03:04.980> basically<00:03:05.250> saturate<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.270> bag<00:03:07.550> all

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
to like basically saturate the bag all

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
to like basically saturate the bag all
right<00:03:08.730> let<00:03:09.210> the<00:03:09.450> water<00:03:09.810> soak<00:03:10.200> into<00:03:10.470> it<00:03:11.570> see

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
right let the water soak into it see

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.820 
right let the water soak into it see
that

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.910 

basically<00:03:17.670> you<00:03:17.820> could<00:03:17.970> submerge<00:03:18.510> it

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
basically you could submerge it

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.200 
basically you could submerge it
basically<00:03:19.920> you<00:03:20.070> want<00:03:20.160> to<00:03:20.280> let<00:03:20.400> soak<00:03:20.760> up<00:03:20.910> like<00:03:21.180> a

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.210 
basically you want to let soak up like a

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.060 
basically you want to let soak up like a
sponge<00:03:21.540> and<00:03:21.930> you<00:03:22.440> can<00:03:22.590> see<00:03:22.770> it's<00:03:22.920> already

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
sponge and you can see it's already

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:29.090 
sponge and you can see it's already
starting<00:03:23.360> to<00:03:25.160> to<00:03:26.160> leak<00:03:26.340> out<00:03:26.810> that<00:03:27.810> edge<00:03:28.170> you

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
starting to to leak out that edge you

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.890 
starting to to leak out that edge you
rest<00:03:29.370> that<00:03:29.610> read<00:03:29.820> on<00:03:29.970> the<00:03:30.120> rim<00:03:30.300> of<00:03:30.330> your<00:03:30.540> cup

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
rest that read on the rim of your cup

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.200 
rest that read on the rim of your cup
and<00:03:31.170> that's<00:03:31.890> going<00:03:32.070> to<00:03:32.160> hold<00:03:32.340> the<00:03:32.550> bag<00:03:32.760> from

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:33.210 
and that's going to hold the bag from

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:39.140 
and that's going to hold the bag from
basically<00:03:34.140> toppling<00:03:34.800> over<00:03:35.690> now<00:03:37.940> like<00:03:38.940> I<00:03:39.090> said

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
basically toppling over now like I said

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.750 
basically toppling over now like I said
you<00:03:39.630> don't<00:03:39.870> what<00:03:40.620> you<00:03:40.740> don't<00:03:41.010> want<00:03:41.250> to<00:03:41.370> do<00:03:41.490> is

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
you don't what you don't want to do is

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.600 
you don't what you don't want to do is
put<00:03:42.420> the<00:03:42.540> bag<00:03:42.750> in<00:03:42.780> first<00:03:43.410> like<00:03:44.040> hook<00:03:44.250> it<00:03:44.400> on<00:03:44.490> the

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
put the bag in first like hook it on the

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.290 
put the bag in first like hook it on the
rim<00:03:44.820> dump<00:03:45.570> the<00:03:45.750> water<00:03:45.930> over<00:03:46.500> it<00:03:47.030> because<00:03:48.030> what

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
rim dump the water over it because what

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:53.140 
rim dump the water over it because what
happens<00:03:49.730> I<00:03:50.730> don't<00:03:51.660> know<00:03:51.750> why<00:03:51.930> it<00:03:51.990> happens<00:03:52.500> but

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
happens I don't know why it happens but

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:59.780 
happens I don't know why it happens but
basically<00:03:54.680> the<00:03:55.680> bag<00:03:55.950> like<00:03:56.370> inflates<00:03:57.090> and<00:03:58.790> it

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
basically the bag like inflates and it

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.420 
basically the bag like inflates and it
like<00:04:00.180> stays<00:04:00.540> like<00:04:00.900> that<00:04:00.930> and<00:04:01.410> basically<00:04:01.980> it

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
like stays like that and basically it

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.720 
like stays like that and basically it
doesn't<00:04:02.820> seep<00:04:03.090> out<00:04:03.270> like<00:04:03.540> it<00:04:03.690> is<00:04:04.160> you<00:04:05.160> can<00:04:05.430> see

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
doesn't seep out like it is you can see

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.070 
doesn't seep out like it is you can see
it's<00:04:06.209> just<00:04:06.390> like<00:04:06.510> a<00:04:06.540> teabag<00:04:06.890> you<00:04:07.890> are<00:04:09.050> there<00:04:10.050> a

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
it's just like a teabag you are there a

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.260 
it's just like a teabag you are there a
lot<00:04:10.290> finer<00:04:11.300> but<00:04:12.300> you<00:04:12.510> can<00:04:12.690> see<00:04:12.930> how<00:04:14.150> you<00:04:15.150> know

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.270 
lot finer but you can see how you know

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.099 
lot finer but you can see how you know
the<00:04:15.570> good<00:04:15.810> coffee<00:04:16.350> is<00:04:16.769> seeping<00:04:17.640> out<00:04:18.019> into<00:04:19.019> the

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
the good coffee is seeping out into the

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.250 
the good coffee is seeping out into the
water<00:04:19.280> so<00:04:20.280> basically<00:04:20.640> once<00:04:20.940> it's<00:04:21.299> like

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
water so basically once it's like

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.210 
water so basically once it's like
saturated<00:04:23.190> you<00:04:23.550> just<00:04:23.760> let<00:04:23.940> it<00:04:24.090> sit<00:04:25.070> all<00:04:26.070> right

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
saturated you just let it sit all right

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.400 
saturated you just let it sit all right
in<00:04:26.430> about<00:04:26.669> five<00:04:26.970> minutes<00:04:27.210> that<00:04:27.810> that's<00:04:28.260> going

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
in about five minutes that that's going
