underperformance<00:04:08.669> because<00:04:08.909> might've<00:04:09.150> been

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
underperformance because might've been

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.199 
underperformance because might've been
like<00:04:09.329> three<00:04:09.540> and<00:04:09.659> a<00:04:09.689> half<00:04:09.719> minutes<00:04:10.730> and<00:04:11.730> that

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
like three and a half minutes and that

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.039 
like three and a half minutes and that
still<00:04:12.449> wasn't<00:04:12.599> like<00:04:13.430> trying<00:04:14.430> to<00:04:14.810> beat<00:04:15.810> some

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
you needed a lot of deaths breath it's

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.100 
you needed a lot of deaths breath it's
like<00:04:37.560> 25<00:04:37.830> per<00:04:38.340> attempt<00:04:38.880> but<00:04:39.720> i<00:04:39.750> have<00:04:39.900> like

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
like 25 per attempt but i have like

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.480 
like 25 per attempt but i have like
thousands<00:04:41.039> of<00:04:41.190> them<00:04:41.280> saved<00:04:41.759> up<00:04:43.340> and<00:04:44.340> we'll

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
thousands of them saved up and we'll

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:45.610 
thousands of them saved up and we'll
just<00:04:44.610> finish<00:04:44.729> this<00:04:44.909> out<00:04:45.090> with<00:04:45.180> the<00:04:45.240> kind<00:04:45.389> of<00:04:45.479> it

shards in kadala and then you take the

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:52.370 
shards in kadala and then you take the
two-handed<00:04:51.330> bows<00:04:51.509> you<00:04:51.810> upgrade<00:04:52.139> them<00:04:52.259> to

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
two-handed bows you upgrade them to

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:17.270 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:19.760 

also<00:06:18.270> there's<00:06:18.420> no<00:06:18.570> more<00:06:18.780> rift<00:06:19.050> key<00:06:19.320> fragment

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770 
also there's no more rift key fragment

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.040 
also there's no more rift key fragment
upgrading<00:06:20.250> obviously<00:06:21.060> because<00:06:21.480> it's<00:06:21.900> all

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050 
upgrading obviously because it's all

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:23.450 
upgrading obviously because it's all
trial<00:06:22.320> keys<00:06:22.560> and<00:06:22.770> if<00:06:22.830> you<00:06:22.920> just<00:06:23.040> complete<00:06:23.430> a

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 
trial keys and if you just complete a

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:29.000 
trial keys and if you just complete a
rift<00:06:23.640> in<00:06:23.730> time<00:06:23.910> you<00:06:24.090> get<00:06:24.240> to<00:06:24.270> do<00:06:24.650> one<00:06:25.650> higher<00:06:28.010> so

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:29.010 
rift in time you get to do one higher so

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:31.640 
rift in time you get to do one higher so
let's<00:06:29.310> see<00:06:29.610> and<00:06:30.300> since<00:06:30.540> you<00:06:30.630> guys<00:06:30.780> requested<00:06:31.170> I

knock with size stone of entrance beta

00:07:41.090 --> 00:07:45.280 
knock with size stone of entrance beta
the<00:07:41.210> powerful<00:07:41.660> wand<00:07:41.870> restraint<00:07:42.410> and<00:07:44.290> mobile

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:45.290 
the powerful wand restraint and mobile

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:47.440 
the powerful wand restraint and mobile
to<00:07:45.380> be<00:07:45.470> schism<00:07:45.830> the<00:07:46.040> focus<00:07:46.430> and<00:07:46.700> then<00:07:47.030> this<00:07:47.240> is

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:47.450 
to be schism the focus and then this is

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:49.180 
to be schism the focus and then this is
the<00:07:47.480> bad<00:07:47.840> boy<00:07:47.870> haven't<00:07:48.380> even<00:07:48.440> rolled<00:07:48.740> this<00:07:48.890> yet

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:49.190 
the bad boy haven't even rolled this yet
