00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 that's how you have to be very careful 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:07.589
 with the internet you can become a 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.780
 real problem and also these 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.490
 online games that many generates 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.960
 terrible addictions we are with indhira 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.940
 you have just heard your 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.350
 testimony this mother who saw herself 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.029
 Surprised from one moment to another star 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.529
 because his son disappeared his son 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:23.160
 teenager taking away not only the 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.949
 savings but without leaving a trace and look 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.210
 how they were good night I imagine 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.720
 that calmer now that he has returned 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.759
 home for quieter course by 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.190
 a quieter part because you already know 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.930
 that your son is safe but the same 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.250
 blind in that addiction is not going to go 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.469
 from one day to the next, you have not 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.320
 decided to make a good shot right now 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.260
 we have changed the school we have 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.059
 changed from school and right now in the child 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.410
 he needs psychological help more than 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.789
 nothing has no more control with the month and 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.320
 He said when you found him like that 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.969
 you found it first, someone negative 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.649
 that he was in that cabin as 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.050
 get to the cabin where good that 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.610
 While I was at the police station, nobody 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.129
 I went in and they called me 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.820
 and they told me that my brother is already 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.750
 they found it 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.310
 right on channel 4 since then if I was the 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.590
 we found on the internet what 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.470
 we found him and found out that what 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.810
 we are testing nissan the most is not that 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.940
 my brother had gone on the internet more 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.619
 before and he had been denied that he was 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.660
 there but they had let him in 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.040
 brother or not to to see for 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.830
 really control the clear 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:33.369
 observe them if my brother came in and 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:35.890
 showed the boy's photo not but he 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:38.259
 they denied that I was there then my 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.729
 brother left but from there asking 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.960
 makes a sign the forms chose not if 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.940
 I have seen him seen and my brother 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.860
 know here and it's in that same cabin 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.570
 internal where he has sung to the 600 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.539
 soles of your savings and then himself 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.670
 spent on that was vip customer in that 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:54.789
 clear moment I imagine the only thing he did 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.500
 he left the young the only interested not 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:58.479
 they are interested in where the child gets the 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.910
 money not what only interest to them 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.560
 win and I guess they help create 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.050
 this addiction also to grab him 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.670
 come out as fixed customers who told you 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.440
 your son when you found him that how 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.970
 he has reacted he feels he has done 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.520
 something bad or do not even realize 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.440
 Of course, if I had reflected enough 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.460
 because all things have been realized 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.460
 not what has caused 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.320
 wants to continue studying because 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.540
 two are you going to stop studying 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:30.770
 well no mom I have to follow 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.560
 studying we are going to an opportunity 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:36.710
 and if I support apology, everything realizes not 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.330
 all because it's not easy a mother can 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:41.690
 sleep without your son who is not there to 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:44.240
 your side, it's two nights, it's not something 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.210
 exasperating and sadder than you 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:50.000
 you are looking for one is sleeping and no 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.800
 you know what happens on the street so many things 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.720
 that you must have had a day 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.490
 I imagine we are also with the doctor 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.830
 manuel saravia that always accompanies us 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:00.020
 quickly to illustrate doctors 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.970
 arabia for a family father who 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.440
 now there is so much access to the internet and everything 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.120
 the world is almost having its 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.040
 computer at home and if you do not give 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.930
 guys because they think the 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.570
 computer to do the things of the 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.950
 tasks instead of playing that signs of 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.050
 alert they have to take into account the 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.310
 parents when first things first 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.680
 we have to say is that there is what 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.200
 it is known as the blind spot the point 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.170
 blind is between 1 and 2 years old parents 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.540
 they think that their son we say is not 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.420
 at risk and are the last to know 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.060
 that the boys have problems 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.970
 a child who has more than 2 hours in front 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.370
 to the computer is a child that is already 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.900
 at risk that suddenly leaves the 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.580
 activities that I used to call the 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.920
 attention how to go out with friends to 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.780
 play football for example I think now 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.250
 they also communicate with friends 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.170
 through the computer then it's like 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.150
 deny them something like that, that's why it's 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.840
 important to regulate the times over 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.280
 two hours is already a warning signal 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.430
 changes in sleep because sometimes it 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:01.040
 they wake up playing many hours locked 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.989
 in their room they no longer participate in the 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.330
 family activities for example no longer 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:07.040
 they want to have lunch together they do not want to go out 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.630
 with the family he sees everything in the 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.980
 computer that regrets nothing 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.319
 immediately because they have left the 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.269
 game running and always stop and go 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:15.769
 and there is not that desktop that time the network 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:18.200
 social not take me but this we see 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:20.180
 same also in a teenager that is 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.320
 but people if it's a child you can say 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.150
 How strange that he wants to share with us 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.680
 the adults but a teenager like that does not 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.370
 it's on the computer you're going to want to go 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.990
 of the table will not want to participate and 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.940
 it's harder or farther it 's clear 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.100
 but the teenager for example in 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.810
 normally he goes out with his friends and we see 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.600
 that lately does not come out anymore 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.220
 in blood in your room so is it 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.410
 suddenly many hours in the cabins of 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.540
 internet is also important to talk 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.669
 with the administrator of the cabins of 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.530
 internet to tell you look this is my 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:50.480
 son and I want I do not want to have it 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.430
 dry all day doctor sarabia and how 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.290
 can be treated if a parent 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.330
 he just heard it and he realizes 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:57.830
 knowing the case of indira that his son 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.550
 have three four or five hours in 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:03.530
 internet and it already changes its behavior that 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:06.350
 have to do a long treatment 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.700
 psychological therapy internment as 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.669
 first you have to do an evaluation 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:12.950
 psychological to see in what stage it 

00:05:10.669 --> 00:05:16.190
 find the dependence in this case to 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:19.190
 video game is not in all cases is 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:21.160
 necessary an internment if it is 

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:23.810
 there is an adult person who can 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:26.240
 control what may be pending 

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:29.090
 of the child can be handled in a 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.340
 ambulatory now there are cases where in addition 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:33.770
 of the therapeutic psychological part 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.690
 will also see the need for a 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.520
 psychiatric management that 's why 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.650
 important to make a good evaluation 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.539
 so this one has to become aware 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.169
 because the same teenager is giving 

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:44.990
 account 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:46.870
 to where is it that you already had the 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:49.189
 control things 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.620
 this happens more with the boys guys 

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:53.060
 that with women is just as good 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.039
 now there is more is like more 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.990
 predisposition for players but 

00:05:55.039 --> 00:05:59.060
 does not mean that the girls are not 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.650
 playing but let's say there is a greater 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.050
 predisposition in values that is to say that 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:04.699
 have a lot more and more attention and 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.199
 know where your children are what they are 

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:07.849
 doing how much time do they spend in the 

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:10.909
 computer and put certain limits 

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:12.830
 because if it does not seem that they can reach 

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:16.219
 have an addiction like this that is not 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:17.990
 nothing funny I commit myself through 

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:21.080
 of the gestalt institute to help the 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:23.629
 Mrs. indira with her son in all that 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.370
 I may need look, I think your case 

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:27.710
 It should also serve to raise awareness 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:29.210
 for example to the authorities for 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:31.009
 those sanctions against those 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:32.779
 booths to those centers that do not have 

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:34.999
 not control and do not regulate 

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:36.830
 really interested if the child even 

00:06:34.999 --> 00:06:40.550
 have until you prostitute yourself and give you the 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:41.150
 wins to continue with that also much 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.830
 Attention 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.719
 If minor has to be at home if 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:47.240
 there must be schedules for these 

00:06:44.719 --> 00:06:48.820
 internet booths there are some that 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:51.160
 the 24 work 

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:54.220
 which is a warning signal too 

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:56.260
 up well many thanks to both 

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.970

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:06.430
 the ears we good now yes pause 

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:09.150
