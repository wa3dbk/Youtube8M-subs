00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
on now you will have to work with this a

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.640 
on now you will have to work with this a
little<00:02:59.069> bit<00:03:00.829> since<00:03:01.829> it<00:03:01.950> is<00:03:02.069> a<00:03:02.099> contoured<00:03:02.640> piece

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
little bit since it is a contoured piece

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.619 
little bit since it is a contoured piece
but<00:03:04.650> it<00:03:04.769> won't<00:03:04.920> be<00:03:05.040> too<00:03:05.189> bad<00:03:08.120> so<00:03:09.120> I<00:03:09.150> like<00:03:09.390> to<00:03:09.510> do
