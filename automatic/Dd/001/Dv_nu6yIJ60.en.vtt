lately is doing a similar type of thing
but<00:00:15.900> in<00:00:16.110> five<00:00:16.590> and<00:00:16.980> not<00:00:17.820> meaning<00:00:18.150> five<00:00:18.330> four

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
but in five and not meaning five four

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.040 
but in five and not meaning five four
time<00:00:18.840> about<00:00:19.020> meaning<00:00:19.380> in<00:00:19.640> quintuplets

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.050 
time about meaning in quintuplets

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.800 
time about meaning in quintuplets
subdividing<00:00:22.050> one<00:00:22.380> beat<00:00:22.710> into<00:00:23.609> five<00:00:23.850> notes<00:00:24.240> or

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
subdividing one beat into five notes or

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.769 
subdividing one beat into five notes or
in<00:00:25.769> five<00:00:26.070> sixteen<00:00:26.820> you<00:00:27.090> could<00:00:27.300> think<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.600> yeah

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
in five sixteen you could think of yeah

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.439 
in five sixteen you could think of yeah
yeah<00:00:28.590> this<00:00:28.949> is<00:00:29.010> all<00:00:29.250> your<00:00:29.400> excuse<00:00:30.150> me<00:00:30.300> you're

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:32.970 
playing the kind of the Moller thing

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.479 
playing the kind of the Moller thing
which<00:00:33.269> works<00:00:33.600> so<00:00:33.900> nicely<00:00:34.170> in<00:00:34.590> groups<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:35.010> three

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
which works so nicely in groups of three

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.030 
which works so nicely in groups of three
mm-hmm<00:00:36.270> now<00:00:36.510> you've<00:00:36.719> got<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.079> get<00:00:37.530> enough

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
mm-hmm now you've got to get enough

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.720 
mm-hmm now you've got to get enough
velocity<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:39.270> have<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.719> last<00:00:39.960> five<00:00:40.379> notes

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
velocity to have it last five notes

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.970 
velocity to have it last five notes
that's<00:00:41.730> that's<00:00:42.149> well<00:00:42.420> put<00:00:42.750> yeah<00:00:43.500> that's<00:00:43.770> right

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
that's that's well put yeah that's right

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.500 
that's that's well put yeah that's right
because<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.250> want<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.700> hear<00:00:44.910> yeah<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:45.149> went<00:00:45.329> from

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
because I want to hear yeah I went from

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.869 
because I want to hear yeah I went from
three<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:46.469> four<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:46.829> then<00:00:47.219> I<00:00:47.250> started<00:00:47.700> working

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
three to four and then I started working

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.020 
three to four and then I started working
with<00:00:48.120> five<00:00:48.480> uh-huh<00:00:49.140> so<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:50.460> know<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:50.850> for

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
with five uh-huh so you know so for

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.910 
with five uh-huh so you know so for
instance<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.600> left<00:00:52.020> hand<00:00:52.320> part<00:00:52.559> looks

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
instance the the left hand part looks

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.939 
instance the the left hand part looks
like<00:00:53.039> this<00:00:53.399> you<00:00:53.670> know<00:00:53.789> tempo<00:00:54.360> is<00:00:54.539> like<00:00:54.949> two

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
like this you know tempo is like two

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:08.870 
like this you know tempo is like two
three<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.480> then<00:01:04.940> it<00:01:05.940> just<00:01:07.040> that<00:01:08.040> was<00:01:08.220> a<00:01:08.250> sort

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
three and then it just that was a sort

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.359 
three and then it just that was a sort
of<00:01:08.970> an<00:01:09.060> exercise<00:01:09.360> in<00:01:09.869> keeping<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.920> left<00:01:11.130> hand

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
of an exercise in keeping the left hand

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.030 
of an exercise in keeping the left hand
going<00:01:12.119> in<00:01:12.330> quintuplets<00:01:13.049> like<00:01:13.229> that<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.619> then

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
going in quintuplets like that and then

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.950 
going in quintuplets like that and then
with<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.310> feet<00:01:14.670> I'm<00:01:14.970> playing<00:01:15.299> doubles<00:01:15.750> but<00:01:15.900> I

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
with the feet I'm playing doubles but I

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.200 
with the feet I'm playing doubles but I
start<00:01:16.320> with<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.530> single<00:01:16.830> note<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.369> then

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
start with a single note and then

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.060 
start with a single note and then
there's<00:01:18.420> four<00:01:18.780> variations<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.799> just

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
there's four variations that just

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.840 
there's four variations that just
naturally<00:01:20.250> occur<00:01:21.320> so<00:01:22.320> one<00:01:23.100> two<00:01:23.430> three<00:01:23.460> four

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
naturally occur so one two three four

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.570 
naturally occur so one two three four
five<00:01:24.390> one<00:01:24.810> two<00:01:24.869> three<00:01:25.200> four<00:01:25.560> five<00:01:26.159> one<00:01:26.520> two

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
five one two three four five one two

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.510 
five one two three four five one two
three<00:01:27.180> four<00:01:27.509> five<00:01:27.810> one<00:01:28.170> two<00:01:28.229> three<00:01:28.799> four<00:01:29.159> five

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
three four five one two three four five

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.440 
three four five one two three four five
one<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.530> and<00:01:31.530> so<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:32.009> with<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.579> feet<00:01:32.820> that

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
one and and so the with the feet that

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.310 
one and and so the with the feet that
goes<00:01:33.689> like<00:01:33.750> this<00:01:34.100> 1<00:01:35.100> 2<00:01:35.280> 3<00:01:35.310> 4<00:01:35.490> 5<00:01:35.880> 1<00:01:36.030> 2<00:01:36.090> 3<00:01:36.240> 4<00:01:36.450> 5<00:01:36.780> 1<00:01:36.990> 2<00:01:37.049> 3

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
goes like this 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3

00:01:37.320 --> 00:02:02.530 
goes like this 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3
4<00:01:37.590> 5

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.930 

so<00:02:03.540> that's<00:02:03.750> like<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:03.990> fundamental<00:02:04.940> ostinato

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
so that's like a fundamental ostinato

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.359 
so that's like a fundamental ostinato
and<00:02:06.270> then<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.390> play<00:02:07.320> some<00:02:07.560> melodies<00:02:08.010> and

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
and then I play some melodies and

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.740 
and then I play some melodies and
different<00:02:09.030> things<00:02:09.890> on<00:02:10.890> top<00:02:11.280> of<00:02:11.490> it<00:02:11.670> and<00:02:12.000> and

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
different things on top of it and and

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.370 
different things on top of it and and
the<00:02:12.870> inspiration<00:02:13.440> for<00:02:13.980> this<00:02:14.160> comes<00:02:14.850> out<00:02:15.030> of<00:02:15.180> my

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
the inspiration for this comes out of my

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.250 
the inspiration for this comes out of my
study<00:02:16.380> of<00:02:16.500> Indian<00:02:17.430> rhythms<00:02:17.910> because<00:02:18.720> this<00:02:19.110> is

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
study of Indian rhythms because this is

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.890 
study of Indian rhythms because this is
a<00:02:19.580> in<00:02:20.580> a<00:02:20.670> way<00:02:20.850> a<00:02:20.880> typical<00:02:22.010> idea<00:02:23.010> of<00:02:23.720> soloing<00:02:24.720> in

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
a in a way a typical idea of soloing in

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.720 
a in a way a typical idea of soloing in
one<00:02:25.340> subdivision<00:02:27.410> whereas<00:02:28.410> you<00:02:29.100> know<00:02:29.220> in<00:02:29.370> the

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
one subdivision whereas you know in the

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.910 
one subdivision whereas you know in the
West<00:02:29.880> we'll<00:02:30.480> jump<00:02:30.870> between<00:02:31.050> triplets<00:02:31.740> and

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
West we'll jump between triplets and

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.770 
West we'll jump between triplets and
sixteenth<00:02:32.130> notes<00:02:32.730> and<00:02:33.120> maybe<00:02:33.510> some

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
sixteenth notes and maybe some

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.510 
sixteenth notes and maybe some
quintuplets<00:02:34.670> where<00:02:35.670> a<00:02:36.090> lot<00:02:36.570> of<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.960> in<00:02:37.800> the<00:02:38.280> in

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
quintuplets where a lot of the in the in

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.190 
quintuplets where a lot of the in the in
the<00:02:38.700> South<00:02:39.540> Indian<00:02:39.860> especially<00:02:42.200> musical

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
the South Indian especially musical

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.500 
the South Indian especially musical
concept<00:02:43.680> if<00:02:43.830> they<00:02:43.980> solo<00:02:44.700> in<00:02:44.970> a<00:02:45.060> subdivision

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
concept if they solo in a subdivision

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.510 
concept if they solo in a subdivision
they'll<00:02:45.900> stick<00:02:46.230> without<00:02:46.590> one<00:02:47.190> particular

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
they'll stick without one particular

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.750 
they'll stick without one particular
subdivision<00:02:47.940> in<00:02:48.450> and<00:02:48.720> not<00:02:49.080> very<00:02:49.590> it<00:02:49.830> not<00:02:50.430> to<00:02:50.610> go

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
subdivision in and not very it not to go

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.420 
subdivision in and not very it not to go
to<00:02:50.820> triplets<00:02:51.360> or<00:02:51.570> where<00:02:52.440> sixteenth<00:02:53.010> notes<00:02:53.250> on

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
to triplets or where sixteenth notes on

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.580 
to triplets or where sixteenth notes on
top<00:02:53.490> of<00:02:53.850> it<00:02:53.940> so<00:02:54.090> I<00:02:54.120> just<00:02:54.330> started<00:02:54.870> to<00:02:54.990> work<00:02:55.260> with

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
top of it so I just started to work with

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.260 
top of it so I just started to work with
that<00:02:55.800> idea<00:02:56.280> and<00:02:56.600> came<00:02:57.600> up<00:02:57.810> with<00:02:58.040> this<00:02:59.270> drum

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
that idea and came up with this drum

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:01.940 
that idea and came up with this drum
solo<00:03:00.480> which<00:03:00.660> is<00:03:00.810> in<00:03:01.020> a<00:03:01.140> way<00:03:01.260> started<00:03:01.739> with<00:03:01.830> the

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
solo which is in a way started with the

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.739 
solo which is in a way started with the
six<00:03:02.190> and<00:03:02.340> then<00:03:02.489> went<00:03:02.730> to<00:03:02.820> the<00:03:02.880> five<00:03:03.209> mm-hmm<00:03:04.200> so
