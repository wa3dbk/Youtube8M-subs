00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
just just don't unless you want to

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.900 
just just don't unless you want to
refill<00:00:19.050> ammo<00:00:19.560> if<00:00:19.800> you're<00:00:19.980> really<00:00:20.279> low<00:00:20.609> but

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
refill ammo if you're really low but

other<00:00:21.060> than<00:00:21.270> that<00:00:21.449> just<00:00:21.480> save<00:00:22.050> them<00:00:22.289> for

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
other than that just save them for

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.880 
other than that just save them for
centuries<00:00:23.539> at<00:00:24.539> around<00:00:24.930> three<00:00:25.350> or<00:00:25.500> four<00:00:25.740> you

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
centuries at around three or four you

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.679 
centuries at around three or four you
should<00:00:26.189> have<00:00:26.369> enough<00:00:26.609> money<00:00:26.880> if<00:00:27.180> you're<00:00:27.420> doing

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
should have enough money if you're doing

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.470 
should have enough money if you're doing
those<00:00:28.109> little<00:00:28.640> money<00:00:29.640> challenges<00:00:30.240> at<00:00:30.359> the

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
those little money challenges at the

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.910 
those little money challenges at the
bottom<00:00:30.779> left<00:00:31.019> you<00:00:31.080> should<00:00:31.199> have<00:00:31.439> enough<00:00:31.650> no

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
bottom left you should have enough no

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.670 
bottom left you should have enough no
problem<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:32.790> then<00:00:33.180> you'll<00:00:33.300> put<00:00:33.540> one<00:00:34.110> right

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
problem and then you'll put one right

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.040 
problem and then you'll put one right
there<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:35.399> then<00:00:35.790> one<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.329> right<00:00:36.780> side

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
there and then one to the right side

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.930 
there and then one to the right side
kind<00:00:37.440> of<00:00:37.530> facing<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.070> tunnel<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.610> left

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
kind of facing the tunnel to the left

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.080 
kind of facing the tunnel to the left
but<00:00:39.809> it'll<00:00:40.110> still<00:00:40.379> boat<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.370> centuries<00:00:41.790> we'll

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
but it'll still boat the centuries we'll

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.860 
but it'll still boat the centuries we'll
hit<00:00:43.020> from<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.770> left<00:00:43.980> side<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.510> we're<00:00:45.510> in

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
hit from the left side and we're in

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.979 
hit from the left side and we're in
front<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:46.469> so<00:00:47.070> they<00:00:47.370> can<00:00:48.090> turn<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.719> kill

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
front of you so they can turn and kill

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.840 
front of you so they can turn and kill
all<00:00:49.200> of<00:00:49.350> them<00:00:49.520> especially<00:00:50.520> on<00:00:51.469> probably<00:00:52.469> about

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
all of them especially on probably about

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.250 
all of them especially on probably about
around<00:00:53.850> ten<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.449> below<00:00:54.750> it's<00:00:55.050> like<00:00:55.230> a

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
around ten and below it's like a

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.410 
around ten and below it's like a
one-shot<00:00:55.920> grenade<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:56.969> kills<00:00:57.180> all<00:00:57.390> of

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
one-shot grenade and it kills all of

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.200 
one-shot grenade and it kills all of
them<00:00:57.629> up<00:00:58.469> farther<00:00:59.370> than<00:00:59.609> that<00:00:59.789> it's<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.059> little

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
them up farther than that it's a little

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.359 
them up farther than that it's a little
more<00:01:00.449> difficult<00:01:02.449> so<00:01:03.449> when<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:03.809> have<00:01:04.280> when<00:01:05.280> you

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
more difficult so when you have when you

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.590 
more difficult so when you have when you
have<00:01:05.400> those<00:01:05.640> sentries<00:01:06.000> come<00:01:06.180> up<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.450> then<00:01:06.570> you

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
have those sentries come up and then you

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.960 
have those sentries come up and then you
got<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.869> fight<00:01:07.049> these<00:01:07.229> guys<00:01:07.439> or<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.189> choppers

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
got to fight these guys or the choppers

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.230 
got to fight these guys or the choppers
try<00:01:09.750> as<00:01:10.110> best<00:01:10.170> as<00:01:10.799> you<00:01:10.830> can<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.520> get<00:01:11.939> rid<00:01:12.150> of

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
try as best as you can to get rid of

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.499 
try as best as you can to get rid of
them<00:01:12.450> as<00:01:12.659> soon<00:01:13.080> as<00:01:13.260> possible<00:01:14.119> otherwise<00:01:15.119> are

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
them as soon as possible otherwise are

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.179 
them as soon as possible otherwise are
gonna<00:01:15.600> destroy<00:01:15.900> your<00:01:16.259> sentries<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.009> you're

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
gonna destroy your sentries and you're

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.219 
gonna destroy your sentries and you're
down<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.640> shitter<00:01:17.880> eight<00:01:18.180> thousand<00:01:18.780> dollars

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
down the shitter eight thousand dollars

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.660 
down the shitter eight thousand dollars
and<00:01:19.580> that<00:01:20.580> kind<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.450> sucks<00:01:22.400> because<00:01:23.400> then<00:01:23.580> you

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
and that kind of sucks because then you

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.179 
and that kind of sucks because then you
got<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.909> worry<00:01:24.060> about<00:01:24.119> juggernauts<00:01:25.189> which

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
got to worry about juggernauts which

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.370 
got to worry about juggernauts which
probably<00:01:26.790> come<00:01:26.970> after<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.509> fact<00:01:27.750> or<00:01:27.960> before

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
probably come after the fact or before

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.700 
probably come after the fact or before
that<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.950> depends<00:01:29.430> I<00:01:29.490> don't<00:01:29.670> know<00:01:29.729> why<00:01:30.290> so<00:01:31.290> like

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
that it depends I don't know why so like

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.359 
that it depends I don't know why so like
I<00:01:31.829> said<00:01:31.890> don't

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
I said don't

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.969 
I said don't
I<00:01:32.430> think<00:01:32.970> I'm<00:01:33.090> round<00:01:33.390> what<00:01:33.810> does<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:34.049> say<00:01:34.320> six<00:01:34.680> I

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
I think I'm round what does it say six I

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.539 
I think I'm round what does it say six I
have<00:01:35.549> not<00:01:35.820> spent<00:01:36.180> any<00:01:36.450> money<00:01:36.689> on<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:36.960> gun<00:01:37.229> yet

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:37.549 
have not spent any money on a gun yet

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:40.340 
have not spent any money on a gun yet
now<00:01:38.549> when<00:01:38.729> you<00:01:38.880> have<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.360> both<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.810> centuries

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
now when you have the both the centuries

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.910 
now when you have the both the centuries
there<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:41.150> you<00:01:42.150> buy<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.810> perk<00:01:43.229> or<00:01:43.409> whatever

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
there and you buy a perk or whatever

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.289 
there and you buy a perk or whatever
perk<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.369> want<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:44.759> don't<00:01:44.820> have<00:01:45.030> sleight<00:01:45.270> of

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
perk you want I don't have sleight of

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.510 
perk you want I don't have sleight of
hand<00:01:45.600> yet<00:01:45.810> so<00:01:46.079> I<00:01:46.110> can't<00:01:47.479> buy<00:01:48.479> an<00:01:48.659> LMG<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.619> then

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
hand yet so I can't buy an LMG and then

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.149 
hand yet so I can't buy an LMG and then
but<00:01:51.119> don't<00:01:51.270> buy<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.600> m249<00:01:52.380> I<00:01:52.590> think<00:01:52.979> that's

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
but don't buy the m249 I think that's

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.690 
but don't buy the m249 I think that's
what<00:01:53.340> this<00:01:53.490> is<00:01:53.729> don't<00:01:54.420> buy<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.960> had<00:01:55.500> no<00:01:55.740> idea<00:01:56.130> how

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
what this is don't buy I had no idea how

until<00:02:23.319> later<00:02:23.590> on<00:02:23.680> because<00:02:24.189> then<00:02:24.310> it<00:02:24.430> just<00:02:24.640> kind

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
until later on because then it just kind

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:26.330 
until later on because then it just kind
of<00:02:24.909> seems<00:02:25.150> like<00:02:25.239> you're<00:02:25.450> wasting<00:02:25.959> the<00:02:26.079> money

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340

of seems like you're wasting the money
the<00:02:27.340> juggernaut<00:02:27.790> guy<00:02:27.970> is<00:02:28.030> very<00:02:28.209> very<00:02:28.810> easy<00:02:29.049> to

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
the juggernaut guy is very very easy to

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.569 
the juggernaut guy is very very easy to
defeat<00:02:29.530> when<00:02:29.739> you<00:02:29.829> when<00:02:30.129> you're<00:02:30.280> in<00:02:30.400> this

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:30.579 
defeat when you when you're in this

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:31.949 
defeat when you when you're in this
corner<00:02:31.000> and<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.180> centuries<00:02:31.599> are<00:02:31.810> there

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
corner and the centuries are there

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.479 
corner and the centuries are there
because<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.409> centuries<00:02:32.799> will<00:02:33.040> shoot<00:02:33.340> the

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
because the centuries will shoot the

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.430 
because the centuries will shoot the
juggernaut<00:02:33.909> and<00:02:34.150> it<00:02:34.360> only<00:02:34.480> takes<00:02:34.750> maybe<00:02:35.260> a

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
juggernaut and it only takes maybe a

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.250 
juggernaut and it only takes maybe a
half<00:02:35.739> a<00:02:35.890> clip<00:02:36.220> of<00:02:36.629> LMG<00:02:37.629> to<00:02:37.750> kill<00:02:37.989> one<00:02:38.579> I<00:02:39.579> would

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
half a clip of LMG to kill one I would

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.880 
half a clip of LMG to kill one I would
see<00:02:41.260> now<00:02:41.939> my<00:02:42.939> sentries<00:02:43.450> are<00:02:43.599> gone<00:02:43.780> so<00:02:44.079> what<00:02:44.859> I

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
see now my sentries are gone so what I

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.460 
see now my sentries are gone so what I
do<00:02:45.069> here<00:02:45.730> is<00:02:45.760> I<00:02:46.209> just<00:02:46.269> kind<00:02:46.569> of<00:02:46.690> run<00:02:47.019> around<00:02:47.140> the

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
do here is I just kind of run around the

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.559 
do here is I just kind of run around the
map<00:02:47.680> until<00:02:47.950> I<00:02:48.010> get<00:02:48.159> enough<00:02:48.400> money<00:02:48.790> then<00:02:49.420> I'll

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
map until I get enough money then I'll

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.589 
map until I get enough money then I'll
if<00:02:50.049> I<00:02:50.409> have<00:02:50.680> certain<00:02:51.519> money<00:02:51.700> from<00:02:51.970> left<00:02:52.209> over

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
if I have certain money from left over

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:54.330 
if I have certain money from left over
the<00:02:52.959> next<00:02:53.170> few<00:02:53.409> rounds<00:02:53.769> because<00:02:53.889> I've<00:02:54.099> noticed

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
the next few rounds because I've noticed

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.559 
the next few rounds because I've noticed
that<00:02:54.670> after<00:02:55.209> the<00:02:55.389> juggernaut<00:02:55.840> round<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:58.150> next

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
that after the juggernaut round the next

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:01.710 
that after the juggernaut round the next
two<00:02:58.840> rounds<00:02:59.470> afterwards<00:03:00.190> are<00:03:00.430> really<00:03:01.239> really

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
two rounds afterwards are really really

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.990 
two rounds afterwards are really really
easy<00:03:02.019> and<00:03:02.200> don't<00:03:02.500> have<00:03:02.739> as<00:03:02.950> much<00:03:03.190> enemies<00:03:03.819> as

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
easy and don't have as much enemies as

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.259 
easy and don't have as much enemies as
they<00:03:04.150> wouldn't<00:03:04.450> normally<00:03:04.950> so<00:03:05.950> I<00:03:06.340> think<00:03:06.970> they

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
they wouldn't normally so I think they

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:08.690 
they wouldn't normally so I think they
did<00:03:07.450> that<00:03:07.480> on<00:03:07.750> purpose<00:03:07.780> just<00:03:08.230> so<00:03:08.530> they<00:03:08.650> don't

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
did that on purpose just so they don't

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.080 
did that on purpose just so they don't
completely<00:03:09.700> screw<00:03:10.030> you<00:03:10.180> over<00:03:11.159> which<00:03:12.159> is<00:03:12.340> great

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
completely screw you over which is great

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.979 
completely screw you over which is great
so<00:03:14.079> get<00:03:14.560> back<00:03:14.769> to<00:03:14.950> those<00:03:15.099> sentries<00:03:15.750> get<00:03:16.750> enough

00:03:16.979 --> 00:03:16.989 
so get back to those sentries get enough

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:22.680 
so get back to those sentries get enough
money<00:03:17.579> to<00:03:19.109> maybe<00:03:20.109> buy<00:03:20.500> at<00:03:21.250> this<00:03:21.549> point<00:03:21.940> another

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
money to maybe buy at this point another

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.409 
money to maybe buy at this point another

really really sucks if you can put a

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.699 
really really sucks if you can put a
grip<00:03:39.549> on<00:03:39.760> the<00:03:40.000> LMG<00:03:40.480> it's<00:03:40.629> not<00:03:40.780> necessary<00:03:41.379> but

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:41.709 
grip on the LMG it's not necessary but

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.750 
grip on the LMG it's not necessary but
it<00:03:41.769> does<00:03:42.220> help<00:03:42.579> with<00:03:43.540> some<00:03:44.199> of<00:03:44.230> the<00:03:44.769> recoil<00:03:45.430> and

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
it does help with some of the recoil and

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.930 
it does help with some of the recoil and
if<00:03:45.910> you're<00:03:46.030> hip<00:03:46.209> firing<00:03:46.540> it<00:03:46.780> helps<00:03:47.049> that<00:03:47.169> -<00:03:47.940> the

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
if you're hip firing it helps that - the

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.699 
if you're hip firing it helps that - the
body<00:03:49.239> armor<00:03:49.780> I<00:03:50.019> do<00:03:50.680> not<00:03:50.829> recommend<00:03:51.540> until<00:03:52.709> you

thing in the whole survival mode so you

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.819 
thing in the whole survival mode so you
you<00:04:13.030> definitely<00:04:13.329> wanted<00:04:14.049> to<00:04:14.079> stick<00:04:14.500> to<00:04:14.680> this

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 
you definitely wanted to stick to this

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:16.830 
you definitely wanted to stick to this
area<00:04:15.129> there's<00:04:15.430> other<00:04:15.669> places<00:04:16.090> that<00:04:16.419> you<00:04:16.599> can

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
area there's other places that you can

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.620 
area there's other places that you can
try<00:04:17.260> out<00:04:17.289> but<00:04:17.889> I<00:04:17.919> have<00:04:18.220> not<00:04:18.430> done<00:04:18.760> so<00:04:19.150> yet<00:04:19.389> but

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
try out but I have not done so yet but

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.440 
try out but I have not done so yet but
this<00:04:19.810> seems<00:04:20.079> to<00:04:20.229> have<00:04:20.440> worked<00:04:20.769> for<00:04:21.099> me

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
this seems to have worked for me

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.129 
this seems to have worked for me
strategy<00:04:23.409> is<00:04:23.440> just<00:04:23.830> sit<00:04:24.159> sit<00:04:24.760> here<00:04:25.270> if<00:04:25.450> I'm

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139 
strategy is just sit sit here if I'm

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:27.030 
strategy is just sit sit here if I'm
taking<00:04:26.590> damage

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
taking damage

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.980 
taking damage
I'll<00:04:27.130> lay<00:04:27.460> down<00:04:27.760> and<00:04:28.150> then<00:04:28.270> throw<00:04:28.540> a<00:04:28.570> flash

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
I'll lay down and then throw a flash

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.170 
I'll lay down and then throw a flash
just<00:04:29.410> straight<00:04:30.160> up<00:04:30.190> in<00:04:30.400> the<00:04:30.430> air<00:04:30.520> it'll<00:04:30.910> flash

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
just straight up in the air it'll flash

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:37.700 
just straight up in the air it'll flash
all<00:04:31.420> of<00:04:31.690> them<00:04:33.480> if<00:04:34.480> that<00:04:34.900> doesn't<00:04:35.350> work<00:04:35.880> then

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
all of them if that doesn't work then

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.000 
all of them if that doesn't work then
shit<00:04:38.710> I<00:04:38.740> don't<00:04:38.980> know<00:04:39.720> because<00:04:40.830> every<00:04:41.830> time

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
shit I don't know because every time

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:43.620 
shit I don't know because every time
that's<00:04:42.220> happened<00:04:42.400> to<00:04:42.670> me<00:04:42.730> where<00:04:43.210> I<00:04:43.240> get<00:04:43.510> to

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
that's happened to me where I get to

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:44.280 
that's happened to me where I get to
this<00:04:43.780> point

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
this point

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.380 
this point
I<00:04:44.380> usually<00:04:44.800> either<00:04:45.100> a<00:04:45.250> throw<00:04:45.730> a<00:04:45.760> flash<00:04:46.060> always

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
I usually either a throw a flash always

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.360 
I usually either a throw a flash always
stock<00:04:46.900> up<00:04:47.110> on<00:04:47.260> flashes<00:04:47.770> too<00:04:47.950> because<00:04:48.190> those

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
stock up on flashes too because those

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.130 
stock up on flashes too because those
are<00:04:48.550> very<00:04:48.580> helpful<00:04:49.000> with<00:04:49.390> their<00:04:49.600> juggernauts

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.140 
are very helpful with their juggernauts

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:54.480 
are very helpful with their juggernauts
and<00:04:51.420> just<00:04:52.420> when<00:04:53.080> you're<00:04:53.230> getting<00:04:53.340> pretty<00:04:54.340> much

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
and just when you're getting pretty much

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.660 
and just when you're getting pretty much
bombarded<00:04:55.420> now<00:04:55.990> I'm<00:04:56.290> killing<00:04:56.590> my<00:04:57.490> other

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
and I do have a lot of money so I just

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.660 
and I do have a lot of money so I just
figured<00:05:01.990> okay<00:05:02.590> well<00:05:02.830> let<00:05:03.010> me<00:05:03.040> just<00:05:03.250> get<00:05:03.460> rid<00:05:03.580> of

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
this guy so I can have three more deltas

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.690 
this guy so I can have three more deltas
or<00:05:07.420> three<00:05:07.750> more<00:05:07.930> just<00:05:08.170> guys<00:05:08.890> with<00:05:09.250> me<00:05:09.430> instead

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 
or three more just guys with me instead

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:10.980 
or three more just guys with me instead
of<00:05:09.820> just<00:05:09.910> having<00:05:10.180> the<00:05:10.360> one<00:05:10.540> and<00:05:10.690> I<00:05:10.750> have<00:05:10.960> to

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
of just having the one and I have to

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:14.070 
of just having the one and I have to
wait<00:05:11.730> and<00:05:12.730> I<00:05:13.150> don't<00:05:13.420> know<00:05:13.510> how<00:05:13.660> this<00:05:13.810> works

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
wait and I don't know how this works

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.640 
wait and I don't know how this works
with<00:05:14.380> two<00:05:14.590> people<00:05:15.570> so<00:05:16.570> I<00:05:16.840> cannot

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
with two people so I cannot

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.480 
with two people so I cannot
I<00:05:17.680> can't<00:05:18.520> 100%<00:05:19.680> guarantee<00:05:20.680> that<00:05:20.980> it<00:05:21.160> would<00:05:21.310> be

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
I can't 100% guarantee that it would be

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.230 
I can't 100% guarantee that it would be
easier<00:05:22.300> or<00:05:22.660> harder<00:05:23.220> doing<00:05:24.220> the<00:05:24.340> same<00:05:24.640> strategy

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 
easier or harder doing the same strategy

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.120 
easier or harder doing the same strategy
I'm<00:05:25.360> doing<00:05:25.690> with<00:05:25.840> two<00:05:25.960> people<00:05:26.170> I'm<00:05:26.560> assuming

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
I'm doing with two people I'm assuming

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.450 
I'm doing with two people I'm assuming
it<00:05:27.250> would<00:05:27.430> be<00:05:27.580> easier<00:05:27.940> but<00:05:29.010> don't<00:05:30.010> take<00:05:30.220> my

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
it would be easier but don't take my

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:31.830 
it would be easier but don't take my
word<00:05:30.670> for<00:05:30.700> it<00:05:31.120> I<00:05:31.240> don't<00:05:31.420> know<00:05:31.480> if<00:05:31.600> it<00:05:31.690> gets

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
word for it I don't know if it gets

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.960 
word for it I don't know if it gets
harder<00:05:32.170> like<00:05:32.350> it<00:05:32.500> doesn't<00:05:32.860> some<00:05:33.160> bees<00:05:33.370> and<00:05:33.580> the

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:33.970 
harder like it doesn't some bees and the

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:39.770 
harder like it doesn't some bees and the
Treyarch<00:05:34.810> games<00:05:37.650> progressively<00:05:38.650> when<00:05:39.490> you

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
Treyarch games progressively when you

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.230 
Treyarch games progressively when you
get<00:05:40.780> to<00:05:40.930> higher<00:05:41.230> waves<00:05:41.650> the<00:05:42.340> enemies<00:05:42.700> do<00:05:42.970> get

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
get to higher waves the enemies do get

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.530 
get to higher waves the enemies do get
much<00:05:43.720> much<00:05:44.020> harder<00:05:44.350> they<00:05:44.710> have<00:05:44.980> you<00:05:45.730> know<00:05:45.850> it

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:46.540 
much much harder they have you know it

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.480 
much much harder they have you know it
seems<00:05:46.870> like<00:05:47.020> all<00:05:47.230> of<00:05:47.260> them<00:05:47.470> have<00:05:47.680> riot<00:05:48.160> gear

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:48.490 
seems like all of them have riot gear

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.030 
seems like all of them have riot gear
but<00:05:49.270> they're<00:05:49.540> not<00:05:49.690> juggernauts<00:05:50.350> if<00:05:50.740> that

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:51.040 
but they're not juggernauts if that

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:52.430 
but they're not juggernauts if that
makes<00:05:51.250> any<00:05:51.370> sense

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
makes any sense

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.860 
makes any sense
the<00:05:53.440> dogs<00:05:53.710> have<00:05:54.130> explosives<00:05:54.880> that<00:05:55.090> sucks<00:05:55.540> I

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
the dogs have explosives that sucks I

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.640 
the dogs have explosives that sucks I
hate<00:05:56.140> it<00:05:56.320> because<00:05:57.220> it<00:05:58.210> just<00:05:58.270> if<00:05:59.080> they<00:05:59.380> stand

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 
hate it because it just if they stand

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.930 
hate it because it just if they stand
next<00:05:59.890> to<00:06:00.040> your<00:06:00.190> sentry<00:06:01.620> and<00:06:02.620> you<00:06:03.100> kill<00:06:03.400> them

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:03.940 
next to your sentry and you kill them

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.140 
next to your sentry and you kill them
next<00:06:04.300> gear<00:06:04.450> century<00:06:05.020> there's<00:06:05.530> a<00:06:05.670> slim<00:06:06.670> not<00:06:07.120> a

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
next gear century there's a slim not a

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:08.970 
next gear century there's a slim not a
slim<00:06:07.510> chance<00:06:07.540> it's<00:06:08.110> like<00:06:08.290> half<00:06:08.560> and<00:06:08.800> half

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:08.980 
slim chance it's like half and half

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.800 
slim chance it's like half and half
sometimes<00:06:09.250> that<00:06:09.730> the<00:06:09.820> sentry<00:06:10.210> will<00:06:10.390> explode

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:10.810 
sometimes that the sentry will explode

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:12.030 
sometimes that the sentry will explode
and<00:06:11.020> just<00:06:11.500> go<00:06:11.710> away

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:12.040 
and just go away

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:18.870 
and just go away
I<00:06:12.930> also<00:06:13.930> recommend<00:06:14.410> if<00:06:15.040> you<00:06:15.790> do<00:06:16.980> have<00:06:17.980> to<00:06:18.460> LM

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:18.880 
I also recommend if you do have to LM

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.390 
I also recommend if you do have to LM
G's<00:06:19.030> if<00:06:19.210> you<00:06:19.300> don't<00:06:19.540> have<00:06:19.720> to<00:06:19.870> LM<00:06:20.140> G's<00:06:20.350> pick<00:06:21.190> up

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:21.400 
G's if you don't have to LM G's pick up

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.580 
G's if you don't have to LM G's pick up
the<00:06:21.550> weapon<00:06:21.970> that<00:06:22.210> they<00:06:22.510> are<00:06:22.720> using<00:06:23.230> if<00:06:23.440> you

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:23.590 
the weapon that they are using if you

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.190 
the weapon that they are using if you
like<00:06:24.070> just<00:06:24.310> have<00:06:24.550> one<00:06:24.850> LMG<00:06:25.390> and<00:06:25.420> one<00:06:25.840> weapon

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:26.200 
like just have one LMG and one weapon

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:29.550 
like just have one LMG and one weapon
they<00:06:26.380> are<00:06:26.530> using<00:06:26.920> because<00:06:27.850> then<00:06:28.530> you<00:06:29.530> know

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:29.560 
they are using because then you know

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.100 
they are using because then you know
you're<00:06:30.010> not<00:06:30.220> struggling<00:06:30.760> to<00:06:31.240> get<00:06:31.360> ammo<00:06:31.780> if<00:06:31.930> you

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.110 
you're not struggling to get ammo if you

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.740 
you're not struggling to get ammo if you
need<00:06:32.410> it<00:06:32.620> you<00:06:33.610> just<00:06:33.760> want<00:06:33.970> to<00:06:34.030> run<00:06:34.210> around<00:06:34.360> and

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:34.750 
need it you just want to run around and

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:35.260 
need it you just want to run around and
then<00:06:34.840> comb

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:35.270 
then comb

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.749 
then comb
now<00:06:35.569> I<00:06:35.930> think<00:06:36.169> right<00:06:36.590> here<00:06:36.620> is<00:06:37.009> where<00:06:37.220> I<00:06:37.250> die

00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:37.759 
now I think right here is where I die

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:41.710 
now I think right here is where I die
round<00:06:38.539> wave<00:06:39.199> 32<00:06:39.800> so<00:06:40.310> that's<00:06:40.520> really<00:06:41.090> high<00:06:41.449> and

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:41.720 
round wave 32 so that's really high and

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.240 
round wave 32 so that's really high and
that's<00:06:41.930> one<00:06:42.410> of<00:06:42.530> the<00:06:42.620> highest<00:06:43.009> on<00:06:43.220> the

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:43.250 
that's one of the highest on the

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:46.420 
that's one of the highest on the
leaderboards<00:06:43.880> so<00:06:44.060> far<00:06:44.449> as<00:06:44.780> of<00:06:45.680> like<00:06:46.130> the

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:46.430 
leaderboards so far as of like the

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:51.370 
leaderboards so far as of like the
second<00:06:46.960> or<00:06:47.960> week<00:06:48.889> and<00:06:49.009> a<00:06:49.099> half<00:06:49.130> of<00:06:50.139> the<00:06:51.139> game's

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:51.380 
second or week and a half of the game's

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:55.779 
second or week and a half of the game's
release<00:06:52.150> so<00:06:53.889> and<00:06:54.889> I<00:06:55.009> think<00:06:55.069> I<00:06:55.280> actually<00:06:55.460> killed

00:06:55.779 --> 00:06:55.789 
release so and I think I actually killed

00:06:55.789 --> 00:06:57.430 
release so and I think I actually killed
myself<00:06:56.000> with<00:06:56.389> the<00:06:56.509> airstrike<00:06:56.900> I'm<00:06:57.050> not<00:06:57.199> even

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:57.440 
myself with the airstrike I'm not even

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.460 
myself with the airstrike I'm not even
sure<00:06:57.680> so<00:06:58.270> so<00:06:59.270> that's<00:06:59.449> my<00:06:59.660> strategy<00:06:59.960> and

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:00.470 
sure so so that's my strategy and

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:04.089 
sure so so that's my strategy and
there's<00:07:00.650> other<00:07:00.860> tips<00:07:01.220> there's<00:07:01.550> a<00:07:01.960> I<00:07:02.960> ranked<00:07:03.889> in

00:07:04.089 --> 00:07:04.099 
there's other tips there's a I ranked in

00:07:04.099 --> 00:07:10.270 
there's other tips there's a I ranked in
at<00:07:05.560> 50<00:07:06.560> in<00:07:06.830> the<00:07:07.009> world<00:07:08.169> just<00:07:09.169> with<00:07:09.440> that<00:07:09.470> solo

at 50 in the world just with that solo
game<00:07:10.550> so<00:07:11.539> that<00:07:11.810> that<00:07:12.650> made<00:07:12.889> me<00:07:13.069> really<00:07:13.490> really

00:07:13.779 --> 00:07:13.789 
game so that that made me really really

00:07:13.789 --> 00:07:18.330 
game so that that made me really really
happy<00:07:14.060> about<00:07:14.330> it<00:07:14.599> and<00:07:14.870> see<00:07:15.500> right<00:07:15.710> there<00:07:15.770> 50<00:07:17.289> so

happy about it and see right there 50 so

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:21.550 
happy about it and see right there 50 so
I'm<00:07:19.340> sure<00:07:19.669> that<00:07:19.909> if<00:07:20.030> I<00:07:20.180> took<00:07:20.240> if<00:07:20.720> I<00:07:20.990> had<00:07:21.229> sleight

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:21.560 
I'm sure that if I took if I had sleight

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:26.499 
I'm sure that if I took if I had sleight
of<00:07:21.590> hand<00:07:22.009> or<00:07:22.460> if<00:07:23.120> I<00:07:23.270> had<00:07:24.669> you<00:07:25.669> know<00:07:25.789> I'll<00:07:25.909> just<00:07:25.940> a

of hand or if I had you know I'll just a
teammate<00:07:27.050> we<00:07:27.409> would<00:07:27.560> probably<00:07:27.889> be<00:07:29.319> really

00:07:30.309 --> 00:07:30.319 
teammate we would probably be really

00:07:30.319 --> 00:07:32.920 
teammate we would probably be really
really<00:07:30.590> higher<00:07:30.860> up<00:07:31.159> there<00:07:31.430> maybe<00:07:31.729> rank<00:07:32.150> 10<00:07:32.539> and

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:32.930 
really higher up there maybe rank 10 and

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:37.960
