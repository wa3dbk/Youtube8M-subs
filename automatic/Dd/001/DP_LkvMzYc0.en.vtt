00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689 
extra steps get above the cage maybe

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:19.359 
extra steps get above the cage maybe
even<00:01:17.990> three<00:01:18.350> and<00:01:18.560> that<00:01:19.040> way<00:01:19.159> you<00:01:19.220> have<00:01:19.310> a

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
even three and that way you have a

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:20.800 
even three and that way you have a
better<00:01:19.579> angle<00:01:19.970> on<00:01:20.090> the<00:01:20.210> cage<00:01:20.420> and<00:01:20.570> you<00:01:20.659> can

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
better angle on the cage and you can

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.270 
better angle on the cage and you can
score<00:01:21.049> more<00:01:21.079> opportunities<00:01:21.799> another

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
important piece about dodging from

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.149 
important piece about dodging from
behind<00:01:23.840> the<00:01:23.990> cage<00:01:24.170> is<00:01:24.350> not<00:01:24.380> necessarily<00:01:25.039> at

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
behind the cage is not necessarily at

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.550 
behind the cage is not necessarily at
the<00:01:25.280> X<00:01:25.460> spot<00:01:25.880> but<00:01:26.600> utilizing<00:01:27.020> your<00:01:27.289> wings

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
there so one important part is to get to

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:39.429 
there so one important part is to get to
your<00:01:37.490> angle<00:01:37.939> see<00:01:38.600> where<00:01:38.780> you're<00:01:38.899> going<00:01:39.079> and
