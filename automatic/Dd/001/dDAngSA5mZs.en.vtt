00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
had them on for about three weeks now I

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.430 
had them on for about three weeks now I
think<00:05:26.760> no<00:05:27.240> not<00:05:27.390> three<00:05:27.570> weeks<00:05:27.630> about<00:05:28.020> two<00:05:28.230> weeks

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
think no not three weeks about two weeks

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.860 
think no not three weeks about two weeks
and<00:05:28.710> they've<00:05:29.610> hardly<00:05:30.000> chipped<00:05:30.390> at<00:05:30.570> all<00:05:30.690> I

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
and they've hardly chipped at all I

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.050 
and they've hardly chipped at all I
think<00:05:30.960> this<00:05:31.110> is<00:05:31.290> the<00:05:31.440> only<00:05:31.590> lime<00:05:31.980> green<00:05:32.340> color

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
think this is the only lime green color

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.900 
think this is the only lime green color
that<00:05:33.360> I<00:05:33.390> own<00:05:33.810> in<00:05:34.169> my<00:05:34.320> collection<00:05:34.919> and<00:05:35.160> I<00:05:35.880> don't

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
that I own in my collection and I don't

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.790 
that I own in my collection and I don't
think<00:05:36.090> I've<00:05:36.300> ever<00:05:36.330> used<00:05:36.540> it<00:05:36.870> until<00:05:37.080> now<00:05:37.410> so

this while I was shopping at Marshalls
and<00:05:54.750> I<00:05:55.169> knew<00:05:55.380> that<00:05:55.590> I<00:05:55.620> had<00:05:55.680> to<00:05:55.950> have<00:05:56.100> it<00:05:56.310> because

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
and I knew that I had to have it because

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.850 
and I knew that I had to have it because
it<00:05:56.700> was<00:05:56.850> only<00:05:57.000> $4.99<00:05:57.960> I've<00:05:58.260> been<00:05:58.560> using<00:05:58.710> this

00:05:58.850 --> 00:05:58.860 
it was only $4.99 I've been using this

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:00.590 
it was only $4.99 I've been using this
ever<00:05:59.070> since<00:05:59.220> I<00:05:59.370> got<00:05:59.520> it<00:05:59.700> and<00:05:59.910> I<00:06:00.120> think<00:06:00.330> it<00:06:00.450> does

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:00.600 
ever since I got it and I think it does

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.570

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:04.169 
the Beauty Blender but I think this does

for<00:06:26.310> a<00:06:26.370> new<00:06:26.850> color<00:06:27.060> and<00:06:27.450> at<00:06:27.660> the<00:06:27.750> color<00:06:27.930> that<00:06:28.020> I

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:28.200 
for a new color and at the color that I

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.150 
for a new color and at the color that I
now<00:06:28.560> own<00:06:28.800> is<00:06:29.810> nude<00:06:30.810> and<00:06:31.169> I<00:06:31.800> think

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.160 
now own is nude and I think

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.440 
now own is nude and I think
I<00:06:32.190> just<00:06:32.370> think<00:06:32.550> that's<00:06:32.700> the<00:06:32.910> other<00:06:32.940> one<00:06:33.270> that<00:06:33.300> I

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:33.450 
I just think that's the other one that I

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:35.660 
I just think that's the other one that I
had<00:06:33.690> was<00:06:33.990> way<00:06:34.170> too<00:06:34.230> light<00:06:34.560> for<00:06:34.860> me<00:06:34.980> although<00:06:35.430> it

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:35.670 
had was way too light for me although it

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:38.450 
had was way too light for me although it
did<00:06:35.880> settle<00:06:36.570> into<00:06:36.960> my<00:06:37.080> skin<00:06:37.410> really<00:06:38.130> well<00:06:38.430> I

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:38.460 
did settle into my skin really well I

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:40.370 
did settle into my skin really well I
think<00:06:38.610> it<00:06:38.940> was<00:06:39.000> just<00:06:39.180> a<00:06:39.360> tad<00:06:39.660> bit<00:06:39.960> too<00:06:39.990> light

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:40.380 
think it was just a tad bit too light

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:43.490 
think it was just a tad bit too light
for<00:06:40.410> me<00:06:40.740> so<00:06:40.950> I<00:06:41.270> decided<00:06:42.270> to<00:06:42.450> get<00:06:42.570> nude<00:06:42.870> and<00:06:43.290> I

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:43.500 
for me so I decided to get nude and I

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:44.900 
for me so I decided to get nude and I
think<00:06:43.710> it's<00:06:43.830> a<00:06:43.920> better<00:06:44.130> match<00:06:44.370> I<00:06:44.580> have<00:06:44.730> it<00:06:44.850> on

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:44.910 
think it's a better match I have it on

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:47.650 
think it's a better match I have it on
today<00:06:45.120> and<00:06:45.480> I<00:06:45.540> have<00:06:45.720> a<00:06:45.750> blog<00:06:45.990> post<00:06:46.020> about<00:06:46.350> it

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:47.660 
today and I have a blog post about it

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:53.310 
complexions and I think it's made for

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:55.580 
complexions and I think it's made for
light<00:06:53.490> to<00:06:53.670> medium<00:06:53.880> skin<00:06:54.540> tones<00:06:54.780> but<00:06:54.990> in

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:55.590 
light to medium skin tones but in

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:57.800 
light to medium skin tones but in
general<00:06:56.430> I<00:06:56.550> just<00:06:56.580> like<00:06:56.970> to<00:06:57.120> go<00:06:57.240> lighter<00:06:57.480> on<00:06:57.600> my
