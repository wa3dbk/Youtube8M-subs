00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:08.419 
just did all the overdubs for about a

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:11.780 
just did all the overdubs for about a
month<00:05:08.599> or<00:05:08.780> two<00:05:08.840> and<00:05:09.340> over<00:05:10.340> at<00:05:10.550> this

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:11.790 
month or two and over at this

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:14.660 
month or two and over at this
of<00:05:11.850> our<00:05:11.940> houses<00:05:12.120> and<00:05:12.330> and<00:05:12.840> and<00:05:13.500> came<00:05:14.370> up<00:05:14.520> with

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:14.670 
of our houses and and and came up with

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.360 
of our houses and and and came up with
what<00:05:15.180> we<00:05:15.300> think<00:05:15.750> is<00:05:15.840> a<00:05:15.870> great<00:05:16.050> album<00:05:16.320> yeah<00:05:16.650> yeah

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
what we think is a great album yeah yeah

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.130 
what we think is a great album yeah yeah
it<00:05:17.460> is<00:05:17.580> good<00:05:17.760> and<00:05:18.000> I<00:05:18.300> was<00:05:18.720> wondering<00:05:19.050> about

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:19.140 
it is good and I was wondering about

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:20.600 
it is good and I was wondering about
that<00:05:19.290> because<00:05:19.620> you<00:05:20.010> know<00:05:20.130> when<00:05:20.280> they<00:05:20.370> say

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
that because you know when they say

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.820 
that because you know when they say
recorded<00:05:21.570> in<00:05:21.690> 10<00:05:21.870> days<00:05:22.020> I<00:05:22.200> thought<00:05:22.380> surely

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
recorded in 10 days I thought surely

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.530 
recorded in 10 days I thought surely
they<00:05:22.980> didn't<00:05:23.190> make<00:05:23.310> a<00:05:23.370> record<00:05:23.610> disk<00:05:24.000> good<00:05:24.330> in

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:24.540 
they didn't make a record disk good in

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.770 
they didn't make a record disk good in
just<00:05:24.930> 10<00:05:25.230> days<00:05:25.260> that's<00:05:25.950> great<00:05:26.420> but<00:05:27.420> we<00:05:27.510> wanted

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
just 10 days that's great but we wanted

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.210 
just 10 days that's great but we wanted
to<00:05:27.810> make<00:05:27.990> sure<00:05:28.020> we<00:05:28.140> got<00:05:28.320> all<00:05:28.380> the<00:05:28.530> performances

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
to make sure we got all the performances

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.070 
to make sure we got all the performances
live<00:05:29.700> you<00:05:30.030> know<00:05:30.150> all<00:05:30.270> the<00:05:30.390> tracking<00:05:30.840> like<00:05:30.960> the

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
live you know all the tracking like the

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.230 
live you know all the tracking like the
band<00:05:31.320> stuff<00:05:31.770> all<00:05:32.250> the<00:05:32.310> basic<00:05:32.790> tracks<00:05:33.030> were

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
band stuff all the basic tracks were

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.880 
band stuff all the basic tracks were
recorded<00:05:33.270> live<00:05:33.840> and<00:05:34.140> then<00:05:34.230> we'd<00:05:34.380> go<00:05:34.410> in<00:05:34.710> and

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:34.890 
recorded live and then we'd go in and

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.070 
recorded live and then we'd go in and
maybe<00:05:34.980> put<00:05:35.280> some<00:05:35.310> organ<00:05:36.180> overdub<00:05:36.600> or<00:05:36.930> like

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
maybe put some organ overdub or like

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.560 
maybe put some organ overdub or like
this<00:05:37.350> or<00:05:37.500> that
