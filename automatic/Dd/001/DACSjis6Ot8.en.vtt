like<00:00:05.670> you<00:00:05.790> were<00:00:05.910> doing<00:00:06.210> was<00:00:06.540> is<00:00:07.140> you<00:00:07.440> didn't

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
like you were doing was is you didn't

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.169 
like you were doing was is you didn't
call<00:00:07.859> as<00:00:08.040> many<00:00:08.189> audibles<00:00:08.670> or<00:00:08.790> at<00:00:08.849> least<00:00:09.000> if<00:00:09.090> you

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
call as many audibles or at least if you

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:10.430 
call as many audibles or at least if you
did<00:00:09.389> they<00:00:09.630> weren't<00:00:09.840> as<00:00:09.929> visible<00:00:10.260> and<00:00:10.380> you

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
did they weren't as visible and you

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.900 
did they weren't as visible and you
didn't<00:00:10.590> wait<00:00:10.800> till<00:00:11.010> late<00:00:11.190> in<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.370> snap<00:00:11.610> count

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
didn't wait till late in the snap count

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.360 
didn't wait till late in the snap count
let<00:00:12.900> them<00:00:13.110> change<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.740> defense<00:00:14.070> how<00:00:14.250> does

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
let them change the defense how does

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:14.810 
let them change the defense how does
that<00:00:14.460> work

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
that work

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.180 
that work
I<00:00:14.849> think<00:00:15.179> we<00:00:15.299> were<00:00:15.389> getting<00:00:15.540> the<00:00:15.780> plays<00:00:16.289> in<00:00:16.529> a

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
I think we were getting the plays in a

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.490 
I think we were getting the plays in a
little<00:00:17.699> earlier<00:00:18.029> and<00:00:18.359> going<00:00:18.660> and<00:00:18.810> actually<00:00:19.199> we

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
little earlier and going and actually we

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.609 
little earlier and going and actually we
work<00:00:20.039> on<00:00:20.340> we<00:00:21.240> were<00:00:21.330> going<00:00:21.570> up<00:00:21.720> you<00:00:22.260> know<00:00:22.350> to

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
work on we were going up you know to

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.140 
work on we were going up you know to
live<00:00:22.769> scrimmage<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.250> lot<00:00:23.369> of<00:00:23.460> times<00:00:23.640> with<00:00:23.939> to

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
live scrimmage a lot of times with to

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.390 
live scrimmage a lot of times with to
place<00:00:24.390> especially<00:00:25.109> early<00:00:25.769> in<00:00:25.890> our<00:00:25.980> first<00:00:26.250> two

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
place especially early in our first two

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.670 
place especially early in our first two
drives<00:00:26.609> so<00:00:27.599> we<00:00:27.720> did<00:00:27.869> have<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.080> lot<00:00:28.260> of<00:00:28.289> audibles

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
drives so we did have a lot of audibles

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.609 
drives so we did have a lot of audibles
but<00:00:29.099> it<00:00:29.220> was<00:00:29.310> I<00:00:29.490> could<00:00:29.849> quickly<00:00:30.390> switch<00:00:31.349> from

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
but it was I could quickly switch from

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.270 
but it was I could quickly switch from
one<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.009> other<00:00:32.840> and<00:00:33.840> so<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.440> think<00:00:34.829> that<00:00:35.010> did

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
one to the other and so I think that did

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.520 
one to the other and so I think that did
help<00:00:35.430> because<00:00:35.790> we<00:00:35.940> were<00:00:36.000> going<00:00:36.270> quickly<00:00:36.690> from

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
help because we were going quickly from

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.790 
help because we were going quickly from
play<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.800> play<00:00:38.210> without<00:00:39.210> many<00:00:39.870> changes<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:40.590> I

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
play to play without many changes and I

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.290 
play to play without many changes and I
think<00:00:40.829> I'd<00:00:41.129> also<00:00:41.160> helped<00:00:41.670> because<00:00:41.940> we<00:00:42.090> weren't

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
think I'd also helped because we weren't

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.720 
think I'd also helped because we weren't
at<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.840> place<00:00:43.230> worlds<00:00:43.800> extremely<00:00:44.309> loud<00:00:44.489> where<00:00:44.670> I

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
at a place worlds extremely loud where I

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.369 
at a place worlds extremely loud where I
don't<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:45.059> say<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.390> two<00:00:45.690> play<00:00:45.870> four<00:00:46.140> or<00:00:46.260> five

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
don't to say the two play four or five

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.930 
don't to say the two play four or five
times<00:00:46.649> down<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.070> line<00:00:47.219> I<00:00:47.250> can<00:00:47.460> just<00:00:47.640> yell<00:00:47.789> it

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
times down the line I can just yell it

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.610 
times down the line I can just yell it
once<00:00:48.120> or<00:00:48.239> twice<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.750> we're<00:00:49.050> back<00:00:49.260> rolling

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
think that's what makes him you know

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.670 
think that's what makes him you know
part<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.479> great<00:01:30.659> player<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.079> he<00:01:31.259> is<00:01:31.409> is

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
part of the great player that he is is

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.069 
part of the great player that he is is
because<00:01:32.310> he<00:01:32.579> brings<00:01:32.790> that<00:01:33.000> fire<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.750> people

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
because he brings that fire and people

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.810 
because he brings that fire and people
look<00:01:34.229> at<00:01:34.350> him<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:35.159> defense<00:01:35.520> wants<00:01:35.759> to

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
look at him and the defense wants to

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.480 
look at him and the defense wants to
play<00:01:36.030> for<00:01:36.299> him<00:01:36.479> they<00:01:36.659> want<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:36.960> in<00:01:37.710> offense<00:01:38.220> you

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
play for him they want to in offense you

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.280 
play for him they want to in offense you
know<00:01:38.610> they<00:01:39.000> want<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.509> score<00:01:39.810> so<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.020> makes<00:01:40.170> it

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
know they want to score so it makes it

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.319

easier<00:01:40.560> on<00:01:40.590> him<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.040> and<00:01:41.159> then<00:01:41.939> he<00:01:42.090> brings

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
easier on him and and then he brings
