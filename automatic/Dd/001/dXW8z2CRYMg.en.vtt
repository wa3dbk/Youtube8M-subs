 modesty that I thank you for 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.900
 first episode we were coming to more 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:27.870

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.220
 courage to continue so the first 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.510
 session and finished we attack the second 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.500
 with the kings so by helping the 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.450
 comments i have someone qaemi 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.960
 clicking it was shit for 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.900
 resale purchase 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.640
 not me anyway I use it I like 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.490
 well i like paul buying resale them 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.330
 kings advise you it is inevitably 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.330
 used given the speed he has 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:56.080
 and just not the job 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:02:02.450
 manchester united 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:04.010
 and that's what yeah so also you 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.560
 speak of acquired he made me I had 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:09.290
 in the comments so a gg that's 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.700
 hell on him I do not know too much about 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.810
 price of these prices so I prefer not 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.510
 too much love adventure and that stops 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.940
 that it's dark a player who is 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.320
 used for resale buying because 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.700
 what is it but what is it? 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.860
 this player so necessarily small 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.980
 spades and that they take they take 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.650
 the small but the little case that he does 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.380
 black and and inevitably she is a lot 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.780
 used so suddenly as is a real 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.280
 many used one can take it skin 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.220
 of the resale purchase so the hugo will live 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.110
 like a small Portuguese scorer kg who 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.110
 joined the Portuguese it has 80 had 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.310
 speeds so I followed why not 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.340
 in short, here I am back in Belgian d1 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.300
 cholet has the bins I am I think 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.400
 that they like the quayside bars but that's 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:54.050
 without credit we can put it back to 2200 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:56.989
 days what the doctors here so 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.390
 the after the vargas also loves Colombian 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.530
 either he has four management stars 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.910
 for that he is not badly used I 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:03.080
 went from a 4 or 5 th I think 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.700
 we are at 4 you do not think she 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.019
 at five 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.000
 no there were eyes then h the coc 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.140
 venezuela make dance that is 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.170
 Colombian so play I think he has 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.340
 four stars letchis t1 like like 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.989
 his name indicated the site and not I 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.090
 is kidding four years old are 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:21.830
 fallen on two necessarily is useful there 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:23.960
 is used respective to bennoo 3-5-2 to 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.060
 650 nke credit 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:29.630
 that's not bad at all after I 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.400
 see the madjid so scorer wins 1 I 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.950
 believe I do not know if it wins a shot 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.320
 I apply there anyway africa on 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.230
 will say they play by tech I believe 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:42.680
 so 92 speed so necessarily 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.500
 use and a lot and we can 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:47.360
 use it for buying the sale 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:50.090
 so that's their money 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.620
 not bad at all then bal and jordan 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.260
 ayew and moss and so I have not come 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.610
 badly not without an embellishment the gambie so 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.780
 I grabbed a game it's not a but 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.680
 four are eclectic will sell them 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.630
 a little more expensive here is the same day 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.390
 besides I had already cengiz this kind 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.890
 in the in one of my league 1 money 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.740
 and change the menus and there a very very 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:14.000
 good shot should so this session 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:16.870
 ends we still have a good little 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.730
 package of players on sale 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:22.010
 hope it's going to go fast enough and 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:25.640
 that's all serving the faux pas all it 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:27.350
 remains only 1.1 madrid 1 on 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.330
 two dunks we get to May 26 credit 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.530
 we know it's still a lot of 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.160
 improve in this episode we doubled 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.560
 the credits 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.210
 we go very very good session game I like 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.940
 although more people we have had if we 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.880
 did a good session 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:43.620
 so here are the dikes even if it will 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.150
 be careful because in itself at 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.830
 early I would see well before eating a 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.240
 little harm but hey those are the 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.130
 remains a majida that their masters in 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.080
 caves directly a little cheaper 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.970
 so when he leaves not after 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.600
 twenty days by putting him a little bit more a 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.540
 slightly cheaper 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:00.810
 what will leave after so that's so 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:03.810
 during this episode we made fifteen 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:08.010
 a thousand profit credit so that's it 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:09.450
 it's not bad at all so 26000 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:11.040
 credit still far from franck ribery 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:13.440
 which costs about 400 thousand credit 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.100
 a little more expensive than that mu he held 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.110
 well it does not matter 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.520
 so here I hope it's small 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.660
 episode you will have liked is not yours 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.640
