00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.500 
it kind of sticks out and looks like
that<00:02:23.590> like<00:02:23.860> I<00:02:24.099> strapped<00:02:24.610> a<00:02:24.730> pie<00:02:24.910> pan<00:02:25.209> to<00:02:25.420> my

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
that like I strapped a pie pan to my

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.900 
that like I strapped a pie pan to my
wrist<00:02:25.750> or<00:02:25.959> something<00:02:26.200> like<00:02:26.379> that<00:02:26.620> so<00:02:26.830> a<00:02:27.280> little

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
wrist or something like that so a little

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:28.890 
wrist or something like that so a little
bit<00:02:28.030> large

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
bit large

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.050 
bit large
I<00:02:28.930> do<00:02:29.200> like<00:02:29.470> large<00:02:29.650> watches<00:02:30.099> but<00:02:30.280> I<00:02:30.519> found<00:02:30.880> that

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
I do like large watches but I found that

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.050 
I do like large watches but I found that
maybe<00:02:32.050> from<00:02:32.380> my<00:02:32.830> fairies<00:02:33.340> from<00:02:33.459> iris<00:02:33.849> size

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
maybe from my fairies from iris size

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.440 
maybe from my fairies from iris size
this<00:02:34.330> this<00:02:34.810> this<00:02:35.170> large<00:02:36.099> flat<00:02:36.580> surface<00:02:36.970> just

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
this this this large flat surface just

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:38.850 
this this this large flat surface just
wasn't<00:02:37.750> working<00:02:38.050> maybe<00:02:38.230> a<00:02:38.349> little<00:02:38.560> bit<00:02:38.739> of

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
wasn't working maybe a little bit of

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.940 
wasn't working maybe a little bit of
articulation<00:02:39.610> on<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.900> face<00:02:41.110> of<00:02:41.140> it<00:02:41.470> with<00:02:41.680> some

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
articulation on the face of it with some

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.490 
articulation on the face of it with some
you<00:02:42.519> know<00:02:42.549> bezels<00:02:43.090> and<00:02:43.450> and<00:02:43.690> and<00:02:43.959> maybe<00:02:44.260> like<00:02:44.470> a

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
you know bezels and and and maybe like a

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.530 
you know bezels and and and maybe like a
curved<00:02:44.980> crease<00:02:45.310> a<00:02:45.430> fire<00:02:45.670> crystal<00:02:45.940> on<00:02:46.239> it<00:02:46.420> or

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
curved crease a fire crystal on it or

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.820 
curved crease a fire crystal on it or
something<00:02:46.840> like<00:02:46.930> that<00:02:48.239> it<00:02:49.239> didn't<00:02:50.110> really<00:02:50.560> do

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
something like that it didn't really do

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.350 
something like that it didn't really do
it<00:02:50.890> for<00:02:51.010> me<00:02:51.220> here<00:02:51.400> it's<00:02:51.640> it's<00:02:51.880> a<00:02:51.970> fun<00:02:52.180> watch

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
it for me here it's it's a fun watch

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.949 
it for me here it's it's a fun watch
it's<00:02:52.959> nice<00:02:53.319> to<00:02:53.769> have<00:02:54.610> something<00:02:54.910> that's<00:02:55.209> you

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
it's nice to have something that's you

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.039 
it's nice to have something that's you
know<00:02:55.989> all<00:02:56.260> black<00:02:56.440> PVD<00:02:56.829> and<00:02:57.099> Swiss<00:02:57.400> made<00:02:57.640> and

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
know all black PVD and Swiss made and

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.009 
know all black PVD and Swiss made and
manual<00:02:59.049> widening<00:02:59.470> with<00:02:59.650> 24<00:03:00.750> millimeter<00:03:01.750> lugs

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
manual widening with 24 millimeter lugs

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.430 
manual widening with 24 millimeter lugs
so<00:03:02.230> you<00:03:02.470> can<00:03:02.620> play<00:03:02.799> around<00:03:03.010> with<00:03:03.190> the<00:03:03.310> look<00:03:03.519> but

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
so you can play around with the look but

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.430 
so you can play around with the look but
ultimately<00:03:05.440> this<00:03:05.860> is<00:03:06.870> just<00:03:07.870> not<00:03:08.110> the<00:03:08.410> right

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
ultimately this is just not the right

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.979 
ultimately this is just not the right
fit<00:03:08.860> for<00:03:08.920> my<00:03:09.220> wrist<00:03:09.540> unfortunately<00:03:10.540> so<00:03:10.750> is

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
fit for my wrist unfortunately so is

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.199 
fit for my wrist unfortunately so is
probably<00:03:11.410> sending<00:03:11.709> this<00:03:11.769> one<00:03:11.920> off<00:03:12.209> eventually

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
probably sending this one off eventually

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.750 
probably sending this one off eventually
as<00:03:13.329> well<00:03:13.540> but<00:03:14.200> glycine's<00:03:14.980> are<00:03:15.130> great<00:03:15.310> watches

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
as well but glycine's are great watches

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.349 
as well but glycine's are great watches
good<00:03:16.299> value<00:03:16.720> I<00:03:17.410> think<00:03:18.010> I<00:03:18.430> think<00:03:18.819> I<00:03:19.060> think

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:19.359 
good value I think I think I think

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:21.479 
good value I think I think I think
they're<00:03:19.690> they're<00:03:20.019> one<00:03:20.049> of<00:03:20.200> the<00:03:20.410> better<00:03:20.980> better

comes<00:03:24.280> to<00:03:26.340> automatic<00:03:27.340> watches<00:03:28.859> so<00:03:30.269> some<00:03:31.269> basic

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
comes to automatic watches so some basic

but<00:03:44.950> generally<00:03:45.160> this<00:03:45.549> watch<00:03:45.940> has<00:03:46.120> been<00:03:46.239> around

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
but generally this watch has been around

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:47.550 
but generally this watch has been around
for<00:03:46.690> over<00:03:46.810> 10<00:03:47.170> years

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
for over 10 years

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.220 
for over 10 years
maybe<00:03:48.130> not<00:03:48.310> the<00:03:48.459> PVD<00:03:48.940> but<00:03:49.150> the<00:03:49.299> became<00:03:49.690> your<00:03:49.900> 48

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
maybe not the PVD but the became your 48

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.770 
maybe not the PVD but the became your 48
has<00:03:50.440> been<00:03:50.560> around<00:03:50.769> for<00:03:51.040> since<00:03:51.790> I<00:03:52.000> think<00:03:52.180> 99

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
has been around for since I think 99

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.840 
has been around for since I think 99
roughly<00:03:53.709> when<00:03:53.859> they<00:03:53.980> introduced<00:03:54.340> this<00:03:54.549> so

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
roughly when they introduced this so

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.920 
roughly when they introduced this so
it's<00:03:55.120> it's<00:03:55.510> it's<00:03:55.840> it's<00:03:56.260> a<00:03:56.859> pretty<00:03:57.040> pretty

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
it's it's it's it's a pretty pretty

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.660 
it's it's it's it's a pretty pretty
pretty<00:03:58.930> iconic<00:03:59.049> watch<00:03:59.620> if<00:04:00.130> you<00:04:00.310> will<00:04:00.489> from

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
pretty iconic watch if you will from

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.890 
pretty iconic watch if you will from
from<00:04:01.120> glycine<00:04:01.540> not<00:04:01.810> not<00:04:02.079> not<00:04:02.859> quite<00:04:03.010> as<00:04:03.900> iconic

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
from glycine not not not quite as iconic

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.870 
from glycine not not not quite as iconic
as<00:04:05.109> their<00:04:05.290> air<00:04:05.620> man's<00:04:05.889> and<00:04:06.280> stuff<00:04:06.489> like<00:04:06.670> that

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
as their air man's and stuff like that

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.330 
as their air man's and stuff like that
but<00:04:07.200> when<00:04:08.200> it<00:04:08.290> comes<00:04:08.440> to<00:04:08.560> their<00:04:08.680> pilot<00:04:08.980> watches

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
but when it comes to their pilot watches

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.599 
but when it comes to their pilot watches
this<00:04:09.489> is<00:04:09.549> this<00:04:09.940> is<00:04:10.090> pretty<00:04:10.269> pretty<00:04:11.280> big<00:04:12.280> iconic

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:12.609 
this is this is pretty pretty big iconic

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:14.550 
this is this is pretty pretty big iconic
