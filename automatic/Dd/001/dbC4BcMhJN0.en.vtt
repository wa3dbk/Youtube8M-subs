they<00:00:34.620> kind<00:00:34.829> of<00:00:34.890> grown<00:00:35.130> me<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.340> bit<00:00:35.520> like<00:00:35.880> at

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
they kind of grown me a bit like at

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.270 
they kind of grown me a bit like at
first<00:00:36.510> like<00:00:37.050> i<00:00:37.140> said<00:00:37.320> i<00:00:37.649> also<00:00:38.010> thought<00:00:38.160> they

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
first like i said i also thought they

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.280 
first like i said i also thought they
look<00:00:38.489> good<00:00:38.640> on<00:00:38.700> other<00:00:38.940> people<00:00:39.420> but<00:00:39.570> on<00:00:39.690> me<00:00:39.899> not

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
look good on other people but on me not

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.280 
look good on other people but on me not
so<00:00:40.440> much<00:00:40.649> but<00:00:41.010> like<00:00:41.640> now<00:00:41.879> they<00:00:42.570> seem<00:00:42.780> easier<00:00:43.140> to

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
so much but like now they seem easier to

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.290 
so much but like now they seem easier to
manage<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.620> take<00:00:43.829> care<00:00:44.040> of<00:00:44.100> because<00:00:44.399> when<00:00:45.210> you

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
manage and take care of because when you

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.760 
manage and take care of because when you
have<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.480> hair<00:00:45.780> out<00:00:45.809> in<00:00:45.899> an<00:00:46.110> afro<00:00:46.440> you<00:00:46.590> have<00:00:46.680> to
