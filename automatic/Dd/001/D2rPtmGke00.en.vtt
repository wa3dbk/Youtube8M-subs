we trained them to get out of their
helicopters<00:00:25.470> if<00:00:25.650> they<00:00:25.769> should<00:00:25.980> happen<00:00:26.250> to

with water they flood pretty quickly so

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.850 
with water they flood pretty quickly so
we<00:00:39.480> teach<00:00:39.840> people<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.140> relax<00:00:40.530> in<00:00:40.739> that

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
we teach people to relax in that

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.819 
we teach people to relax in that
environment<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.940> be<00:00:42.059> calm<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.930> to<00:00:43.500> use

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
environment to be calm and and to use

environment to be calm and and to use
the<00:00:43.980> procedure<00:00:44.340> that<00:00:44.520> we<00:00:44.640> trained<00:00:44.850> them<00:00:44.879> to

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
the procedure that we trained them to

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.450 
the procedure that we trained them to
use<00:00:45.539> so<00:00:46.230> that<00:00:46.350> they<00:00:46.410> can<00:00:46.530> get<00:00:46.620> out<00:00:46.680> in<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:47.010> in<00:00:47.340> a

right side up and figure out where
everything<00:01:51.440> is<00:01:51.710> and<00:01:51.979> it's<00:01:52.130> gonna<00:01:52.580> be<00:01:52.670> dark<00:01:52.910> and

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
everything is and it's gonna be dark and

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.120 
everything is and it's gonna be dark and
it's<00:01:54.020> really<00:01:54.260> cool<00:01:54.410> thing<00:01:54.590> to<00:01:54.619> do<00:01:54.830> once<00:01:55.040> you

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
it's really cool thing to do once you

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.230 
it's really cool thing to do once you
get<00:01:55.220> into<00:01:55.399> it<00:01:55.520> but<00:01:55.670> it's<00:01:55.790> hard<00:01:56.119> to<00:01:56.180> start<00:01:56.420> off

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
get into it but it's hard to start off

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.280 
get into it but it's hard to start off
first<00:01:59.240> time<00:01:59.450> I<00:01:59.540> went<00:01:59.690> in<00:01:59.810> I<00:01:59.899> was<00:02:00.080> a<00:02:00.110> bit

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
you're fully submerged and it kind of

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.380 
you're fully submerged and it kind of
knocks<00:02:04.340> the<00:02:04.610> air<00:02:04.790> out<00:02:04.940> of<00:02:04.970> you<00:02:05.119> and<00:02:05.270> then
