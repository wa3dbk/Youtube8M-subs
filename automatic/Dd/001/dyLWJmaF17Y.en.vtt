00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.790
 gameplay first game today 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.680
 called greedy grub this farm but 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.480
 rather non-standard and where we will be 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.679
 play for such a merry 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.110
 orange caterpillar 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.000
 we need to harvest which 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.570
 times standing on the trees with the help of such 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.500
 here is tapov on apple there our caterpillar 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.590
 crawling 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.539
 and gathers all the fruits and we still 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.449
 what do you need to do to take water from 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.179
 wells to water all of our 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.369
 what kind of plants are there? 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.520
 tasks assignments are varied 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.550
 take the story and see what we 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.270
 need to do so talk to mr 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.579
 quince and take something from him 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.030
 let's try to talk to him here 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:50.579
 this mr iphone talked to us and 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.039
 gave us some kind of crystals that we 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.680
 pleasure we collect and perform 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.920
 the assignment here was the assignment build 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.820
 here is such a building, what am i not 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.010
 I know build a bank 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:08.430
 build some particular tree 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.220
 we also planted and by the way now we 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.939
 it is proposed to grow this tree yet 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.920
 so better that the tree grow 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:18.869
 must wait twenty nine 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.750
 minutes but we can skip this for 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.540
 crystal and get experience and our tree 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.150
 instantly grow well in general, everything is like 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.490
 in other ordinary farms but than me this 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.820
 farm hooked it tel what here 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.310
 characters what plot here and in general 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.850
 the game certainly stands out from all 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.320
 other firms here are all characters 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.290
 various animals that come to 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.970
 you on a visit and give certain tasks 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:50.149
 Well, now let's see what we have 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:53.009
 Now we need a task with a tree 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:56.189
 let's do something with the eye 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:59.570
 let's go click this button 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:03.240
 we have grown, we have received again this clover 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:06.000
 peculiar experience and performed successfully 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.459
 The task here is such a farm I think many 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.580
 I liked it and you probably want to 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.880
 yourself and try and play is necessary 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.730
 watering trees 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.150
 squeeze them collect fruits and carry 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:22.090
 many, many interesting tasks second 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.370
 the game is called melt it and this is a 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.010
 specific runner and let's get on it 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:31.300
 see here he is on missions but messi 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:32.620
 are on the order that is not needed 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.990
 push the next mission you 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.570
 automatically if you get to Denmark 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:39.760
 go to her first this game here 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.620
 such here each place has its own 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.200
 special bonuses in this for example 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.600
 acceleration in other missions will be 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.970
 various jumps and so on here 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.640
 for example in 6 missions you will fly already 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.440
 not from the face 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.080
 Spaceship But such will fly off 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:59.770
 you are from the first person and you need 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.550
 will do what tasks you 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.440
 will be required 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.710
 dodge some yellow 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.170
 squares that will be located there 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:11.050
 and so unfortunately I lost because 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.640
 that it was necessary to go on these here 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:15.910
 accelerating lane otherwise 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.430
 leg the plane is losing speed but why 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.710
 then when we first started this mission 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.830
 no longer that mission began another apparently 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:24.970
 they are somehow random here 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.400
 are generated and it probably depends on 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.320
 the fact that I have already completed 6 missions and 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.030
 so here is the variety 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.550
 It is proposed because when I am alone 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.680
 set or pass missions at first 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:38.110
 all missions were exactly the same 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.450
 who liked this space 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.570
 specific runner download well and we 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.370
 go ahead 3 plays and india lasso 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.100
 called pi here there is 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.890
 several game modes and let's play 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.570
 I propose to play one of them 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:55.180
 infinite and see what this game 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:58.510
 management 10 is carried out 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.370
 using tapov on the left on the right 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.620
 side to turn here 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.310
 This is our ball in no case 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:08.380
 you can't crash into obstacles otherwise you 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.570
 lose and can not install a new 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:13.900
 record either pass the mission if you will 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:15.700
 play in a voyage mode 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.920
 An interesting toy is always here 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.380
 changing colors constantly generated 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:23.099
 any obstacles from which you 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:26.770
 is just incredible 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:29.229
 cool dodge here you drive by 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:32.020
 such an interesting route which 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:35.020
 represents some kind of line complete 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:37.840
 turns the twist drank steep and so 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.840
 further I liked this arcade but 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.550
 she spoils your nerves very much 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.250
 so if you have a weak nervous 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.349
 system then I would not advise you in it 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.539
 play but if you are fine with 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:51.340
 nerves please play and 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:53.770
 enjoy arcade data 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.120
 and the last game for today is called 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.120
 bash mixed 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.580
 let's play no and see here we are 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:04.479
 We will play for the Viking 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:08.740
 lenders took his house and therefore 

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:11.770
 now he decided to fight these 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:14.129
 incredibly evil creditors and decided 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:17.379
 get your house back what we need to do 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:20.259
 clicking on the left of the screen we 

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:22.449
 manage his position presses 

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:25.060
 right side of the screen we choose it 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:27.550
 weapons and red enemies need 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:30.550
 wet the red weapons of autumn enemies 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.349
 it is necessary to wet once after damn strong 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.750
 weapons in general you understood me from you 

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:36.819
 There are two types of weapons and you need 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:39.930
 it has time to switch correctly if 

00:05:36.819 --> 00:05:43.449
 you wrong it switch it you 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:46.380
 take damage and unfortunately fill up 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:49.810
 emissions but it seems like it can be 3 times 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:52.990
 err so don't be color blind 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:55.690
 and all Pick up the correct color that 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:58.539
 required for each type of enemies 

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:02.379
 perhaps further will be the types of weapons still 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:03.009
 more but at first there are only two in general 

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:05.139
 here is such 

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:06.879
 interesting arcade to with pleasant 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:08.680
 graphics and interesting ideas 

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:10.840
 let's get me a special weapon 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.779
 wrong to choose you to see what 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:15.550
 happens if you do that but on 

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:18.039
 this is all for today, thank you very much
