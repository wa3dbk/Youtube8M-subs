this<00:00:22.660> 17<00:00:23.200> marketplace<00:00:23.680> and<00:00:25.619> we'll<00:00:26.619> have<00:00:26.770> a

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:26.830 
this 17 marketplace and we'll have a

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:33.750 
this 17 marketplace and we'll have a
look<00:00:26.980> at<00:00:27.130> that<00:00:31.140> so<00:00:32.140> the<00:00:32.380> game<00:00:32.590> has<00:00:32.890> around<00:00:33.250> 22

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
look at that so the game has around 22

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.470 
look at that so the game has around 22
levels<00:00:34.120> and<00:00:34.590> as<00:00:35.590> you<00:00:35.920> play<00:00:36.220> across<00:00:36.579> each<00:00:37.120> gain

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
levels and as you play across each gain

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.960 
levels and as you play across each gain
level<00:00:38.020> the<00:00:38.739> next<00:00:38.980> one<00:00:39.130> gets<00:00:39.340> unlocked<00:00:39.610> and<00:00:39.940> the

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:39.970 
level the next one gets unlocked and the

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.110 
level the next one gets unlocked and the
idea<00:00:40.870> is<00:00:40.930> to<00:00:41.079> get<00:00:41.320> the<00:00:41.470> fastest<00:00:41.890> time<00:00:42.190> so<00:00:42.430> I've

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
idea is to get the fastest time so I've

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.299 
idea is to get the fastest time so I've
completed<00:00:43.510> a<00:00:43.660> few<00:00:43.989> and<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:46.719> can<00:00:47.019> see<00:00:47.260> the<00:00:48.039> idea

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
completed a few and you can see the idea

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.500 
completed a few and you can see the idea
is<00:00:48.399> to<00:00:48.640> unite<00:00:48.969> these<00:00:49.300> two<00:00:49.359> balls<00:00:49.960> together<00:00:51.510> so

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
is to unite these two balls together so

00:00:52.510 --> 00:01:04.049 
is to unite these two balls together so
let's<00:00:52.780> go<00:00:53.500> to<00:00:53.559> level<00:00:53.920> select<00:00:55.679> ok<00:00:56.679> and<00:01:02.820> see<00:01:03.820> what

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
let's go to level select ok and see what

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.950 
let's go to level select ok and see what
the<00:01:04.180> game<00:01:04.330> is<00:01:04.360> over<00:01:06.270> so<00:01:07.270> as<00:01:07.330> you<00:01:07.420> can<00:01:07.570> see<00:01:07.780> there

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
the game is over so as you can see there

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.690 
the game is over so as you can see there
are<00:01:07.990> two<00:01:08.080> balls<00:01:08.530> and<00:01:08.890> you<00:01:09.130> have<00:01:09.220> to<00:01:09.370> use<00:01:09.400> the

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
are two balls and you have to use the

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:16.340 
are two balls and you have to use the
accelerometer<00:01:13.590> another<00:01:14.590> party<00:01:15.070> United<00:01:15.550> and

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
accelerometer another party United and

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:29.790 
accelerometer another party United and
you<00:01:17.350> get<00:01:17.530> mobile<00:01:18.010> sin<00:01:26.520> so<00:01:27.520> as<00:01:27.820> you<00:01:28.630> can<00:01:28.780> see<00:01:29.020> the

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:29.800 
you get mobile sin so as you can see the

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.490 
you get mobile sin so as you can see the
bigger<00:01:29.980> one<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:31.360> acts<00:01:31.630> kind<00:01:32.140> of<00:01:32.260> different

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
bigger one it acts kind of different

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:45.330 
bigger one it acts kind of different
than<00:01:35.500> the<00:01:35.710> other<00:01:35.830> one<00:01:42.330> so<00:01:43.680> my<00:01:44.680> previous<00:01:45.100> time

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
than the other one so my previous time

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.380 
than the other one so my previous time
was<00:01:45.640> 28<00:01:46.480> something<00:01:46.960> and<00:01:47.200> now<00:01:47.350> I<00:01:47.380> got<00:01:47.680> 50<00:01:48.390> you

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
was 28 something and now I got 50 you

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.360
