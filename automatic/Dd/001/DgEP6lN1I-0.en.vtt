know<00:01:03.510> Mark<00:01:03.750> Casey's<00:01:04.170> all<00:01:04.500> 59<00:01:04.860> times<00:01:05.309> many<00:01:05.970> it's

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
know Mark Casey's all 59 times many it's

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.810 
know Mark Casey's all 59 times many it's
about<00:01:06.299> 58<00:01:06.780> times<00:01:07.080> so<00:01:07.320> these<00:01:07.470> guys<00:01:07.770> really<00:01:08.670> get

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
about 58 times so these guys really get

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.550 
about 58 times so these guys really get
into<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.150> they<00:01:09.420> get<00:01:09.570> after<00:01:09.900> it<00:01:09.930> but<00:01:10.470> I<00:01:10.530> really

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
into it they get after it but I really

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.920 
into it they get after it but I really
think<00:01:10.830> since<00:01:11.340> many<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:12.210> approved<00:01:12.600> as<00:01:12.689> footwork

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
think since many is approved as footwork

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.050 
think since many is approved as footwork
is<00:01:13.320> proof<00:01:13.560> is<00:01:13.710> right<00:01:13.860> hand<00:01:14.159> sense<00:01:14.430> by<00:01:14.729> number

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
is proof is right hand sense by number

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.550 
is proof is right hand sense by number
two<00:01:15.210> I<00:01:15.240> don't<00:01:15.450> think<00:01:15.840> this<00:01:15.990> one<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.229> going<00:01:16.470> to

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
two I don't think this one is going to

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.840 
two I don't think this one is going to
go<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.710> dis<00:01:16.979> don't<00:01:17.220> think<00:01:17.460> this<00:01:17.610> one's<00:01:17.759> going
