00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.600
 the 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.610
 really very concerned and applied you 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.080
 really very very happy it was also 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.180
 a little challenge from the team's stadium 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.700
 France with whom we worked a lot 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.770
 together that's who was a group 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.620
 France is not created only dragon 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.160
 and it's true that with 12 out of 18 players 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.059
 or 19 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.680
 you could think that I would have a little bit of 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.239
 groups three groups and actually I 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.370
 found very very well very involved 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.330
 knew that it's boys who soon 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.220
 that they start working together 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.960
 we saw how I saw a lot 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.600
 of automatisms against the players 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.340
 and frankly I 'm proud of them because 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.810
 that they have achieved a feat 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.619
 I think the last time 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.290
 the France team was going to win 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.810
 the academy was when teddy sadaoui 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.520
 was junior so about 12 years old I 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.220
 think about what I feel especially 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.810
 is that the accumulation of these matches 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.020
 face precisely these academy players 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.130
 did our players get on and we got 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.630
 could see him only physically 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.399
 that is to say that physically we were 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.530
 well until the match until the end of 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:34.170
 match forgiveness 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.970
 there are 2 3 1 but missed the five ten 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.530
 last minutes last year the 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.750
 match had been played directly at the 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.580
 last minute here I felt them 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.140
 very serene the dragon fairies ben I 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.220
 think it's indisputable in the 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.270
 to the extent that in addition there are 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.460
 key players who have been really 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.050
 important and we really see the 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.790
 progression of his players since 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.830
 last year most of which was 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.030
 cadet ben simply the wigan that's 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.670
 the strongest team that we encounter 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.259
 so it went well I was going to say 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.080
 until half time since we were at 10 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.280
 6 after it has been more difficult 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.259
 wigan is still a team that 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.800
 proposes who asks a lot of questions 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:13.850
 to the defenses who has this ability to 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.850
 move the ball and 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.250
 it was in any case an important step 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.250
 in our learning 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.880
 so we're going to see precisely for more 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.440
 a month and a half 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.470
 almost two months the progress they 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.410
 have really accomplished on the job 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.090
 defensive and fight that was it was a 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.610
 will 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.959
 earlier in the last week and 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.019
 so the beginning of this week 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.209
 after i will attach myself as liszt 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:41.670
 here they are rather context of the match 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.959
 it's wigan it's a prestigious match 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.120
 facing one of the best academies 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.760
 the one that produces the most players and 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.060
 national teams and also in super 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.860
 league 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.140
 so we have it is for us a new 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.140
 step new ways to evaluate ourselves
