of<00:01:55.050> these<00:01:55.230> things<00:01:55.590> even<00:01:56.010> though<00:01:56.130> there<00:01:56.280> are

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
of these things even though there are

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.070 
of these things even though there are
little<00:01:56.520> scoots<00:01:56.850> at<00:01:57.030> they're<00:01:57.180> very<00:01:57.420> very<00:01:57.720> tall

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
little scoots at they're very very tall

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.550 
little scoots at they're very very tall
and<00:01:58.430> indeed<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.730> seat<00:02:00.030> is<00:02:00.300> very<00:02:00.720> very<00:02:01.050> comfy

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
and indeed the seat is very very comfy

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
but very wide this makes it a problem no

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
knock it off the stand and it's still a

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.030 
knock it off the stand and it's still a
problem<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.240> lot<00:02:09.450> of<00:02:09.510> people<00:02:09.600> do<00:02:10.140> like<00:02:10.380> to<00:02:10.860> put

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
problem a lot of people do like to put

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.710 
problem a lot of people do like to put
the<00:02:11.190> foot<00:02:11.400> firmly<00:02:11.820> on<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.150> ground

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
the foot firmly on the ground

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.470 
the foot firmly on the ground
now<00:02:13.110> I<00:02:13.140> can<00:02:13.350> do<00:02:13.500> so<00:02:13.770> with<00:02:14.190> one<00:02:14.370> foot<00:02:14.670> but<00:02:15.120> not<00:02:15.330> we

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
now I can do so with one foot but not we

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.930 
now I can do so with one foot but not we
both<00:02:15.720> either<00:02:15.990> side<00:02:16.380> and<00:02:16.800> there's<00:02:17.700> another

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
both either side and there's another

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.070 
both either side and there's another
thing<00:02:18.270> as<00:02:18.480> well<00:02:19.130> it's<00:02:20.130> only<00:02:20.490> got<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.210> main<00:02:21.600> stand

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
thing as well it's only got a main stand

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.620 
thing as well it's only got a main stand
and<00:02:22.710> why<00:02:23.130> did<00:02:23.640> they<00:02:23.730> only<00:02:23.880> put<00:02:24.090> a<00:02:24.120> main<00:02:24.360> stand

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
and why did they only put a main stand

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.270 
and why did they only put a main stand
on<00:02:24.780> because<00:02:25.020> again<00:02:25.470> that<00:02:25.770> could<00:02:25.950> be<00:02:26.070> two

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
on because again that could be two

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.570 
on because again that could be two
people<00:02:26.550> from<00:02:27.180> buying<00:02:27.450> a<00:02:27.570> bike<00:02:27.750> like<00:02:27.990> this<00:02:28.580> all

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
people from buying a bike like this all

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.280 
people from buying a bike like this all
right<00:02:29.880> gripes<00:02:30.240> over<00:02:30.630> now<00:02:30.750> no<00:02:31.080> more

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
right gripes over now no more

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.170 
right gripes over now no more
complaining<00:02:31.830> it's<00:02:32.250> actually<00:02:32.700> a<00:02:32.850> smashing

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
complaining it's actually a smashing

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.780 
complaining it's actually a smashing
little<00:02:33.540> machine<00:02:33.840> this<00:02:34.080> it's<00:02:34.590> a<00:02:34.890> one<00:02:35.280> to<00:02:35.490> five

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
little machine this it's a one to five

therefore<00:02:39.000> up<00:02:39.240> front<00:02:39.600> here<00:02:39.900> we<00:02:40.260> have<00:02:40.380> a

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
therefore up front here we have a

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.100 
therefore up front here we have a
radiator<00:02:40.920> and<00:02:41.310> like<00:02:41.760> a<00:02:41.790> fan<00:02:42.240> to<00:02:42.510> keep<00:02:42.720> it<00:02:42.900> cool

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
radiator and like a fan to keep it cool

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.870

because<00:02:43.470> obviously<00:02:43.980> a<00:02:44.100> machine<00:02:44.489> like<00:02:44.670> this

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
because obviously a machine like this

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.760 
because obviously a machine like this

in about
I<00:03:31.620> mean<00:03:32.310> this<00:03:32.489> little<00:03:32.640> baby<00:03:33.000> will<00:03:33.239> probably<00:03:33.300> do

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
I mean this little baby will probably do

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.240 
I mean this little baby will probably do
a<00:03:33.720> zillion<00:03:34.080> mouths<00:03:34.440> to<00:03:34.680> the<00:03:34.769> gallon

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
a zillion mouths to the gallon

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.979 
a zillion mouths to the gallon
it<00:03:35.459> almost<00:03:35.610> certainly<00:03:36.060> will<00:03:36.360> do<00:03:36.540> double<00:03:36.840> the

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
it almost certainly will do double the

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:38.930 
it almost certainly will do double the
average<00:03:37.200> calf<00:03:37.800> which<00:03:38.190> is<00:03:38.370> great<00:03:38.640> on<00:03:38.819> the

average calf which is great on the
economics<00:03:39.599> and<00:03:39.750> because<00:03:40.500> it's<00:03:40.650> a<00:03:40.739> four-stroke

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.470 
economics and because it's a four-stroke
engine<00:03:41.519> of<00:03:41.610> course<00:03:41.849> you<00:03:42.000> don't<00:03:42.180> need<00:03:42.330> the

like<00:04:18.030> this<00:04:18.299> so<00:04:19.169> start<00:04:20.160> with<00:04:20.250> the<00:04:20.370> basics<00:04:20.820> going

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
like this so start with the basics going

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.450 
like this so start with the basics going
forward<00:04:21.900> for<00:04:22.139> example<00:04:22.680> well<00:04:22.860> normally<00:04:23.280> on<00:04:23.430> a

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
forward for example well normally on a

forward for example well normally on a
push<00:04:23.700> bike<00:04:23.940> you<00:04:24.150> pedal<00:04:24.510> but<00:04:25.080> on<00:04:25.200> one<00:04:25.320> of<00:04:25.350> these

push bike you pedal but on one of these

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:28.250 
push bike you pedal but on one of these
is<00:04:25.860> real<00:04:26.130> lazy<00:04:26.430> because<00:04:27.210> you<00:04:27.479> just<00:04:27.720> turn<00:04:27.960> the

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
is real lazy because you just turn the

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.710 
is real lazy because you just turn the
throttle<00:04:28.470> the<00:04:29.250> accelerator<00:04:29.820> and<00:04:30.120> the<00:04:30.510> way<00:04:30.660> you

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
throttle the accelerator and the way you

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.650 
throttle the accelerator and the way you
go<00:04:31.050> to<00:04:31.889> stop<00:04:32.190> could<00:04:32.789> be<00:04:32.910> any<00:04:33.030> simpler<00:04:33.389> just

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
go to stop could be any simpler just

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.170 
go to stop could be any simpler just

like a push bike you pull that lever on

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.850
