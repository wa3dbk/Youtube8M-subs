control<00:02:21.079> and<00:02:22.040> I<00:02:22.159> think<00:02:22.189> his<00:02:22.670> point<00:02:22.879> of<00:02:22.999> view<00:02:23.060> he

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
control and I think his point of view he

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.420 
control and I think his point of view he
hates<00:02:23.540> to<00:02:23.749> win<00:02:23.900> by<00:02:24.109> disqualification<00:02:24.430> because

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
hates to win by disqualification because

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.989 
hates to win by disqualification because
it's<00:02:25.579> dominated<00:02:25.999> the<00:02:26.239> fight<00:02:26.420> I<00:02:27.879> think<00:02:28.879> he

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:28.999 
it's dominated the fight I think he

00:02:28.999 --> 00:02:31.330 
it's dominated the fight I think he
would<00:02:29.180> want<00:02:29.420> to<00:02:30.019> win<00:02:30.200> this<00:02:30.230> while<00:02:30.799> no<00:02:31.010> he<00:02:31.159> would

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
would want to win this while no he would

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.000 
would want to win this while no he would
