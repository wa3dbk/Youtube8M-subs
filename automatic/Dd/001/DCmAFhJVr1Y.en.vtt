00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.120 
really damaged and one thing that I

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.000 
really damaged and one thing that I
realized<00:01:12.600> in<00:01:12.780> these<00:01:12.990> days<00:01:13.230> is<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.500> I'm

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
realized in these days is that I'm

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.850 
realized in these days is that I'm
experiencing<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:15.030> little<00:01:15.900> bit<00:01:16.050> of<00:01:16.170> hair<00:01:16.650> loss

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
experiencing a little bit of hair loss

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.070 
experiencing a little bit of hair loss
maybe<00:01:17.580> it's<00:01:17.850> because<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.420> stress<00:01:18.810> or

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
maybe it's because of the stress or

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.110 
maybe it's because of the stress or
maybe<00:01:19.530> it's<00:01:19.740> because<00:01:19.860> of<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.280> hair<00:01:20.430> chemical

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:21.120 
maybe it's because of the hair chemical

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.540 
maybe it's because of the hair chemical
treatment<00:01:21.510> that<00:01:21.600> I've<00:01:21.780> been<00:01:21.930> receiving<00:01:22.550> for

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:26.300 
treatment that I've been receiving for
past<00:01:24.000> few<00:01:24.390> years<00:01:24.780> or<00:01:25.140> maybe<00:01:25.710> it's<00:01:25.890> because<00:01:26.010> of

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
past few years or maybe it's because of

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.820 
past few years or maybe it's because of
it<00:01:26.400> aging<00:01:26.940> so<00:01:27.300> I've<00:01:27.660> been<00:01:27.930> taking<00:01:28.320> care<00:01:28.470> of<00:01:28.530> my

scalp and that is hair in order to

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.670 
scalp and that is hair in order to
prevent<00:01:32.010> the<00:01:32.340> further<00:01:32.790> hair<00:01:33.360> loss<00:01:33.470> so<00:01:34.470> I'm

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.400 
introduce you some of the products that
we<00:01:38.220> have<00:01:38.250> on<00:01:38.610> which<00:01:38.850> trend<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:39.540> have<00:01:40.170> seen

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410 
we have on which trend that I have seen

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.190 
we have on which trend that I have seen
a<00:01:40.650> great<00:01:40.860> improvement<00:01:41.310> on<00:01:41.700> my<00:01:41.790> scalp<00:01:42.480> and<00:01:42.720> hair

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
a great improvement on my scalp and hair

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:54.149 
a great improvement on my scalp and hair
so<00:01:43.680> here<00:01:44.220> it<00:01:44.340> goes

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:56.620 

so<00:01:55.159> when<00:01:55.430> it<00:01:55.520> comes<00:01:55.670> to<00:01:55.850> prevent<00:01:56.270> the<00:01:56.420> hair

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
so when it comes to prevent the hair

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.690 
so when it comes to prevent the hair
loss<00:01:56.869> it<00:01:57.170> is<00:01:57.200> very<00:01:57.500> important<00:01:58.040> to<00:01:58.159> avoid<00:01:58.340> the

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
loss it is very important to avoid the

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.240 
loss it is very important to avoid the
stress<00:01:58.970> and<00:01:59.240> minimize<00:02:00.110> the<00:02:00.649> chemical

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
stress and minimize the chemical

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.710 
stress and minimize the chemical
treatment<00:02:01.670> that<00:02:01.729> you<00:02:01.820> receive<00:02:02.180> on<00:02:02.360> your<00:02:02.509> hair

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
treatment that you receive on your hair

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.190
