we'll go ahead and remove a rail and

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.180 
we'll go ahead and remove a rail and
then<00:00:45.629> drill<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:45.870> pilot<00:00:45.899> hole<00:00:46.260> we'll<00:00:46.829> do<00:00:46.920> this<00:00:47.010> on

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
then drill a pilot hole we'll do this on

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.910 
then drill a pilot hole we'll do this on
both<00:00:47.340> sides<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:47.969> bed<00:00:48.469> well<00:00:49.469> if<00:00:49.530> our<00:00:49.620> pilot

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.130 
of the frame brackets we'll be working
with<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.160> driver's<00:00:53.550> side<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.969> hold<00:00:54.960> up

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
with the driver's side and hold up

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.959 
with the driver's side and hold up
against<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.440> frame<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:55.949> compare<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.879> the

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
against the frame and compare it to the

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.819 
against the frame and compare it to the
holes<00:00:57.120> we<00:00:57.270> just<00:00:57.300> drilled<00:00:57.510> at<00:00:58.350> this<00:00:58.559> point

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
holes we just drilled at this point

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.319 
holes we just drilled at this point
we'll<00:00:58.980> also<00:00:59.070> take<00:00:59.309> part<00:00:59.579> of<00:00:59.760> hardware<00:01:00.059> for<00:01:00.120> a

mounting rails torque down then we'll go

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:11.920 
mounting rails torque down then we'll go
ahead<00:03:10.850> and<00:03:10.970> tighten<00:03:11.180> and<00:03:11.420> torque<00:03:11.660> the<00:03:11.750> frame

tightened<00:03:19.700> down<00:03:19.820> we'll<00:03:20.390> have<00:03:20.450> to<00:03:20.780> install<00:03:21.050> two

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
tightened down we'll have to install two

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.230 
tightened down we'll have to install two
more<00:03:21.410> bolts<00:03:21.740> will<00:03:22.400> install<00:03:22.610> two<00:03:22.850> bolts<00:03:23.150> on

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:23.240 
more bolts will install two bolts on

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.900 
more bolts will install two bolts on
inside<00:03:23.900> edges<00:03:24.260> of<00:03:24.290> the<00:03:24.530> mounting<00:03:25.250> rails<00:03:25.460> and

inside edges of the mounting rails and

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.880 
inside edges of the mounting rails and
we'll<00:03:26.060> leave<00:03:26.180> these<00:03:26.300> bolts<00:03:26.600> for<00:03:26.720> last<00:03:26.930> so<00:03:27.830> it

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
we'll leave these bolts for last so it

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.080 
we'll leave these bolts for last so it
makes<00:03:28.040> a<00:03:28.130> bit<00:03:28.250> easier<00:03:28.520> to<00:03:28.550> adjust<00:03:28.670> the<00:03:28.910> rails

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
makes a bit easier to adjust the rails

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.000 
makes a bit easier to adjust the rails
if<00:03:29.300> needed<00:03:29.720> to<00:03:30.230> make<00:03:30.350> sure<00:03:30.380> the<00:03:30.650> hitch<00:03:30.770> can<00:03:30.950> be

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
if needed to make sure the hitch can be

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.560 
if needed to make sure the hitch can be
removed<00:03:31.310> we'll<00:03:31.850> get<00:03:32.000> we'll<00:03:32.150> go<00:03:32.270> ahead<00:03:32.480> and

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
removed we'll get we'll go ahead and

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.390 
removed we'll get we'll go ahead and
route<00:03:32.750> half-inch<00:03:33.140> hole<00:03:33.290> and<00:03:33.890> just<00:03:34.130> run<00:03:34.280> our

route half-inch hole and just run our
bolt<00:03:34.520> through<00:03:34.610> and<00:03:34.970> underneath<00:03:35.420> we'll<00:03:35.630> get<00:03:35.750> a

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
bolt through and underneath we'll get a

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.110 
bolt through and underneath we'll get a
conical<00:03:36.140> tooth<00:03:36.260> washer<00:03:36.650> and<00:03:36.830> nut<00:03:37.250> then<00:03:38.000> we'll

conical tooth washer and nut then we'll

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.190 
conical tooth washer and nut then we'll
torque<00:03:38.360> those<00:03:38.540> down<00:03:38.750> as<00:03:38.930> well<00:03:40.060> at<00:03:41.060> this<00:03:41.930> point

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
torque those down as well at this point

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.420 
torque those down as well at this point
we<00:03:42.290> can<00:03:42.380> go<00:03:42.410> ahead<00:03:42.500> and<00:03:42.680> reinstall<00:03:42.950> the<00:03:43.220> tire

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
we can go ahead and reinstall the tire

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.340 
we can go ahead and reinstall the tire
and<00:03:43.610> wheels<00:03:43.790> and<00:03:44.090> now<00:03:44.690> finish<00:03:45.020> it<00:03:45.170> for<00:03:45.290> our
