today's<00:00:59.480> video<00:00:59.720> is<00:00:59.780> I<00:01:00.910> thought<00:01:01.910> I'd<00:01:02.030> let<00:01:02.150> you

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
today's video is I thought I'd let you

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.320 
today's video is I thought I'd let you
guys<00:01:02.360> know<00:01:02.960> about<00:01:03.260> this<00:01:03.980> new<00:01:04.220> soul<00:01:04.880> system

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
guys know about this new soul system

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.030 
guys know about this new soul system
soul<00:01:05.780> weapon<00:01:06.170> that<00:01:06.320> we<00:01:06.410> got<00:01:06.620> so<00:01:06.920> it's

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 
soul weapon that we got so it's

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.300 
soul weapon that we got so it's
basically<00:01:07.370> a<00:01:08.240> new<00:01:08.720> potential<00:01:09.410> I<00:01:09.950> guess<00:01:10.130> that

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
basically a new potential I guess that

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.260 
basically a new potential I guess that
we<00:01:10.370> can<00:01:10.490> add<00:01:10.610> to<00:01:10.640> our<00:01:10.790> weapons<00:01:12.730> so<00:01:13.730> each<00:01:13.970> boss

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
we can add to our weapons so each boss

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.469 
we can add to our weapons so each boss
drops<00:01:14.770> some<00:01:15.770> bosses<00:01:15.980> drop<00:01:16.370> shards<00:01:16.880> and<00:01:17.090> you

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
drops some bosses drop shards and you

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.140 
drops some bosses drop shards and you
combine<00:01:17.660> ten<00:01:18.110> shots<00:01:18.410> to<00:01:18.680> get<00:01:18.940> one<00:01:19.940> of<00:01:20.060> these

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150 
combine ten shots to get one of these

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.969 
combine ten shots to get one of these
soul<00:01:20.450> things<00:01:21.050> and<00:01:22.479> the<00:01:23.479> soul<00:01:23.750> you<00:01:24.619> can<00:01:24.740> equip

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
soul things and the soul you can equip

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.640

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
and you get this these soul absorbing

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.250 
and you get this these soul absorbing
little<00:03:07.819> red<00:03:08.090> flying<00:03:08.540> ball<00:03:08.930> things<00:03:10.180> and<00:03:11.260> that

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
little red flying ball things and that

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.550 
little red flying ball things and that
charges<00:03:12.709> it<00:03:12.829> up<00:03:12.950> to<00:03:13.130> about<00:03:13.340> 1000<00:03:14.180> so<00:03:14.560> yeah

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
charges it up to about 1000 so yeah

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:25.740 
charges it up to about 1000 so yeah
that's<00:03:15.829> pretty<00:03:15.920> cool<00:03:16.100> I<00:03:16.549> guess<00:03:23.530> just<00:03:24.530> keep

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
that's pretty cool I guess just keep

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:34.250

Oh

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.899 

because<00:03:34.500> of<00:03:34.620> all<00:03:34.769> the<00:03:34.950> drops<00:03:36.230> okay<00:03:37.230> much<00:03:38.129> it's

because of all the drops okay much it's
enough<00:03:39.209> I<00:03:39.420> think<00:03:40.670> so<00:03:41.670> exit<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.120> map<00:03:42.329> here<00:03:44.750> all

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:56.350 
enough I think so exit the map here all
right<00:03:48.230> so<00:03:49.230> this<00:03:49.409> bath<00:03:49.700> go<00:03:50.700> ahead<00:03:50.879> and<00:03:51.000> use<00:03:51.180> it
