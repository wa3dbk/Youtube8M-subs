 September 1985 has circulated 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.210
 the story of a series of picture 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.670
 damn weeping kids since the 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.800
 newspaper the song published the story of a 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.680
 yorkshire fireman who claimed that 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.390
 copies of these pictures were to be found 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.380
 intact among the ruins of houses 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.840
 burned 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.910
 for November of that same year the 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.760
 belief in this curse was so 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.950
 extended that tenacity organized burning 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.750
 massive of the paintings sent by their 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.670
 readers 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.520
 several people called absurd this 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.120
 curse and blamed the song for the 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.789
 paranoia created 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:57.160
 the crying child is a reproduction 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:01:00.160
 printed from a series of paintings 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:03.820
 italian painter bruno amario known 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.680
 also like giovanni bara goleen these 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.159
 they had a wide distribution to 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.740
 from the 1950s there are 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:13.810
 numerous alternative versions being 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.380
 all of them portraits of boys or girls 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.380
 crying 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.890
 the truth of this story is that the 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.690
 varnish or used to make these 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.720
 hard copies of the series of paintings 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.520
 it was fire resistant so the 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.310
 rope from which the paintings hung 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.590
 It would be the first to burn 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:37.060
 that the paintings fell to the ground and 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.939
 they will be protected from the fire 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.850
 steve font a writer and comedian 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:45.220
 British was the one who solved the mystery 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.320
 of the curse of this painting putting 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:49.210
 so a stop to the collective paranoia that 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.450
 it had been generated 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.940
 on the internet this story created by the 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.820
 sensationalist newspaper of song is 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.860
 still selling as real probably 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.990
 the same newspaper pushed this story 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.990
 with the desire to generate more sales 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.630
 and like the case of the child's picture that 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.240
 cries many of the mysteries have a 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.940
 scientific explanation but for lack of 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:17.000
 knowledge or research are left in 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.680
 mysteries although there is no doubt that there 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.340
 many cases that continue without a 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.340
 Explanation
