you're<00:01:19.049> gonna<00:01:19.140> pull<00:01:19.350> off<00:01:19.609> to<00:01:20.609> open<00:01:21.000> G<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:22.140> then

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
you're gonna pull off to open G and then

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.940 
you're gonna pull off to open G and then
it's<00:01:22.520> G<00:01:23.520> Phi<00:01:23.729> with<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.329> first<00:01:24.539> finger<00:01:24.860> put<00:01:25.860> in

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
it's G Phi with the first finger put in

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.730 
it's G Phi with the first finger put in
to<00:01:26.039> open<00:01:26.159> G<00:01:26.520> so<00:01:26.880> here's<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.119> first<00:01:27.270> four<00:01:27.509> notes

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.559 

very<00:01:31.740> simple<00:01:32.159> that's<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.459> on<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.640> g<00:01:32.819> string<00:01:32.850> to

00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:33.569 
very simple that's it on the g string to

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:36.699 
very simple that's it on the g string to
the<00:01:33.689> D<00:01:33.840> string<00:01:33.899> now<00:01:34.289> you're<00:01:34.890> gonna<00:01:34.979> play<00:01:35.159> d7

00:01:36.699 --> 00:01:36.709 
the D string now you're gonna play d7

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:41.690 
the D string now you're gonna play d7
pull<00:01:37.709> to<00:01:37.859> open<00:01:37.890> D<00:01:38.929> d5<00:01:39.929> and<00:01:40.319> you<00:01:41.099> put<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.340> open<00:01:41.549> D

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
pull to open D d5 and you put the open D

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:49.309 
pull to open D d5 and you put the open D
so<00:01:42.239> on<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.750> D<00:01:42.869> string<00:01:42.899> is<00:01:47.659> so<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.810> entire<00:01:48.840> like

00:01:49.309 --> 00:01:49.319 
so on the D string is so the entire like

00:01:49.319 --> 00:02:01.169 
so on the D string is so the entire like
is<00:01:49.439> this

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:01.179 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:03.300 

which<00:02:01.869> to<00:02:01.990> be<00:02:02.079> honest<00:02:02.259> owns<00:02:02.469> a<00:02:02.679> fairly<00:02:03.039> rubbish

with my right hand as I'm being in with
a<00:02:42.610> plectrum<00:02:42.930> to<00:02:43.930> attempt<00:02:44.200> to<00:02:44.260> get<00:02:44.500> some<00:02:44.790> after

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
a plectrum to attempt to get some after

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.190 
a plectrum to attempt to get some after
fishel<00:02:46.090> harmonic<00:02:46.510> overtones<00:02:46.990> and<00:02:47.080> we

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
fishel harmonic overtones and we

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.410 
fishel harmonic overtones and we
discussed<00:02:47.530> this<00:02:47.650> on<00:02:47.860> last<00:02:48.430> week's<00:02:48.670> whittler

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
discussed this on last week's whittler

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.300 
discussed this on last week's whittler
episode<00:02:49.900> so<00:02:50.500> if<00:02:50.590> you're<00:02:50.710> not<00:02:50.800> sure<00:02:50.950> how<00:02:51.070> to<00:02:51.130> get

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
episode so if you're not sure how to get

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.160 
episode so if you're not sure how to get
the<00:02:51.460> harmonics<00:02:51.940> go<00:02:52.570> and<00:02:52.690> watch<00:02:52.810> that<00:02:53.020> one

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
the harmonics go and watch that one

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.170 
the harmonics go and watch that one
explains<00:02:53.980> how<00:02:54.100> to<00:02:54.160> get<00:02:54.310> there<00:02:54.520> so<00:02:54.730> we<00:02:54.970> take

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
explains how to get there so we take

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.530 
explains how to get there so we take
over<00:02:55.330> the<00:02:55.420> paper<00:02:57.120> don't<00:02:58.120> forget<00:02:58.420> some

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
over the paper don't forget some

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
over the paper don't forget some
harmonics<00:03:03.300> and<00:03:04.300> that's<00:03:04.480> that<00:03:04.750> there's<00:03:05.470> one

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
harmonics and that's that there's one

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.020 
harmonics and that's that there's one
other<00:03:05.710> thing<00:03:05.860> I'm<00:03:05.950> doing<00:03:05.980> with<00:03:06.160> the<00:03:06.280> lake<00:03:06.430> I

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
other thing I'm doing with the lake I

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.850 
other thing I'm doing with the lake I
start<00:03:07.420> off<00:03:07.540> playing<00:03:07.720> straight<00:03:08.140> sandy<00:03:08.470> quavers

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
start off playing straight sandy quavers

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.380 
start off playing straight sandy quavers
and<00:03:09.070> then<00:03:09.460> I<00:03:09.550> move<00:03:09.730> it<00:03:09.850> to<00:03:09.880> semi<00:03:10.150> quiver

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
and then I move it to semi quiver

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:11.880 
and then I move it to semi quiver
triplets<00:03:10.870> so<00:03:10.930> a<00:03:11.020> change<00:03:11.320> of<00:03:11.440> rhythmic<00:03:11.620> you've

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
triplets so a change of rhythmic you've

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:21.170 
triplets so a change of rhythmic you've
rhythmically<00:03:12.670> from<00:03:13.120> that<00:03:19.590> sort<00:03:20.590> of<00:03:20.650> thing<00:03:20.860> so

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
rhythmically from that sort of thing so

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.550 
rhythmically from that sort of thing so
let<00:03:22.180> me<00:03:22.270> just<00:03:22.390> demonstrate<00:03:22.540> that<00:03:22.960> so<00:03:23.200> as<00:03:23.530> a

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
let me just demonstrate that so as a

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.140 
let me just demonstrate that so as a
sixteenths<00:03:24.100> and<00:03:24.160> then<00:03:24.310> we'll<00:03:24.460> shift<00:03:24.610> to<00:03:24.790> 16th

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
sixteenths and then we'll shift to 16th

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:35.410 
sixteenths and then we'll shift to 16th
note<00:03:25.300> triplets<00:03:25.330> yeah

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.339 

so<00:03:36.420> I<00:03:36.450> think<00:03:36.540> in<00:03:36.780> here<00:03:36.900> that<00:03:37.109> seems

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349 
so I think in here that seems

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:38.839 
so I think in here that seems
particularly<00:03:37.650> effective<00:03:38.219> at<00:03:38.280> 16th<00:03:38.670> note

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 
particularly effective at 16th note

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:40.550 
particularly effective at 16th note
triplets<00:03:38.879> because<00:03:39.450> there's<00:03:39.659> some<00:03:40.170> sort<00:03:40.439> of

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
triplets because there's some sort of

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.379 
triplets because there's some sort of
syncopation<00:03:41.069> as<00:03:41.519> it<00:03:41.760> goes<00:03:41.849> over<00:03:41.999> the<00:03:42.180> time

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:42.389 
syncopation as it goes over the time

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:43.879 
syncopation as it goes over the time
very<00:03:42.659> straight<00:03:42.989> and<00:03:43.019> sixteenth<00:03:43.469> notes<00:03:43.709> no

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:43.889 
very straight and sixteenth notes no

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:45.619 
very straight and sixteenth notes no
good<00:03:44.099> though<00:03:44.280> but<00:03:44.489> the<00:03:44.760> second<00:03:45.090> note<00:03:45.239> triplets

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:45.629 
good though but the second note triplets

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:48.199 
good though but the second note triplets
very<00:03:45.840> very<00:03:46.079> effective<00:03:46.620> sounding<00:03:47.010> okay<00:03:47.819> well

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
very very effective sounding okay well

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:49.399 
very very effective sounding okay well
that<00:03:48.329> wraps<00:03:48.569> up<00:03:48.780> the<00:03:48.900> teaching<00:03:49.079> of<00:03:49.290> this
