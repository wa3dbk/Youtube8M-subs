00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 good morning folks, I'm explaining to 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.980
 you here 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:12.799
 how did I make the change here in 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:17.460
 my place to be able to adapt 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:21.750
 this hand protector here from the circus and that 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:24.630
 in reality for motorcycle street but at 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:29.670
 site said neco that serves for also 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:33.809
 talking only that there are some details in there 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:36.780
 They will not talk when you buy this. 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:41.010
 protector in reality it comes with a 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.170
 bolt for you to put on bikes that 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.410
 has that weight of guidon that you 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.760
 remove and remove the screw and screw 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:55.079
 then overweight 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:57.780
 only in this case here of the lander what 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.780
 gift from Holland has no weight or better 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.280
 her weight is in here and he is 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.489
 soldier in here 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.100
 So what does the person have to do? 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.330
 have to stick are some options is 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.830
 people say nÃ© 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.990
 one of them is a saw hurricane pantry right 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.820
 take the weight or but then do not give me I do not 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.479
 I'll drop in here because 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:26.640
 it can fade that dong is not cool 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:29.700
 you take him hamas it out here 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:35.240
 in my specific case I put the 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.240
 how I put the okay guidon show 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.040
 high 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:46.619
 he already comes he does not come any better 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:50.850
 gift content to qui 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:55.520
 He already comes here with an empty barrel, right? 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:59.930
 so have I done to be able to adapt to 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:03.119
 first thing I bought a bushel 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.310
 of these wall bushes, right? 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:09.179
 Only I bought a metal one is 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:12.380
 little bigger and stronger only 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:15.680
 even so not in the case of the accelerator 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.290
 the first case in this case 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.970
 what happened 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.550
 the accelerator 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.460
 this part on the left side of the 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.860
 handle is still a very 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.770
 big even you pressing her not 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:34.280
 had room to lock 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:37.790
 so what I did I cut a piece 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.820
 of a hose and put more or 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.450
 less as the bolt stays 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:47.360
 came in and then I put the screw 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:52.400
 squeezed slammed 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:56.060
 it has this natural handling and it 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:03:01.310
 cool, this is the default right 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:04.280
 right here in the separate part of 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.090
 iron in the mirror on the bolt does not 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.870
 problem 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:13.400
 on the side of here a little more complicated 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:17.150
 because there's that piece of 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:19.730
 accelerator and this piece here it has a 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:23.210
 tooth in reality it has a hole 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.050
 at the entrance and then there 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.480
 open right 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:29.480
 as if it were a butterfly had here 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.930
 inside plastic and this disrupts 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.690
 why are you going to put the screw 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:39.140
 he has a certain difficulty here 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:41.480
 then he gets focused inside the boat 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:45.800
 a purse will not lock legal 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:49.310
 So what I did I used that in 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.750
 drill that kind of drill one of your 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.890
 right name but that anger that 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:57.530
 sheltered rock xica did not think the 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:00.709
 word hole is a kind of a cone 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.540
 in it's shape then you'll be boring 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:06.410
 she here right? 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:09.440
 and she goes in and out, I go 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:14.959
 more or less to stay in width 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:17.890
 prissy wedge then made a beauty 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:20.570
 get the backpack 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:22.260
 only in this case here I preferred 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:25.460
 put a girl on the day 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.870
 the wall also but not metal 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.660
 rubber even if I'm not mistaken it was 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:35.490
 a number 10 bushing 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:38.880
 I put the wilt here and pressed a 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:44.430
 locked thing insured that he is 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:46.980
 natural that the screw that screw already 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:50.640
 Come on, it's a little longer. 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:54.540
 The other one gets shorter here. 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:58.920
 Pretty cool, if I thought I agreed. 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:03.000
 enough is much for protection when knocking 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:04.980
 I'm not going to keep it cool. 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.390
 but I think it's practically 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:09.930
 stay cool 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:15.960
 now talking about the handlebars is a little bit 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:19.250
 more work because the handlebar has it 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:23.670
 here as it is wider and it 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:28.190
 directly on the cables. 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:28.190
 clutch and accelerator 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:40.200
 Now one thing is good for you to do the 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:44.460
 you try to pull the maximum 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:49.710
 this set can be 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:51.900
 loose here and if I'm not mistaken that 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:57.710
 now I do not remember but what? 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:06:03.450
 already has a time up 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:06.350
 so he stays here over and over in 

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:09.410
 Up will not work 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:12.990
 it will not work 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:17.370
 so what do you have to play and 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:19.830
 stay down just unscrew turns 

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:23.250
 set all down and the car 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:24.390
 Here you go and put a butterfly. 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:27.900
 right here 

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:32.450
 that plastic clamps for 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:32.450
 hold however this one 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:40.680
 as the original passed down here in 

00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:42.389
 same thing as that of the clutch the 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:46.020
 clutch is not like it stays in the 

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:47.069
 through the same thing I had to bring this 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:52.889
 cable 

00:06:47.069 --> 00:06:55.800
 this set up here then left over 

00:06:52.889 --> 00:06:58.349
 leaving the clutch quieter not 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:01.710
 being that you have a limitation to 

00:06:58.349 --> 00:07:04.650
 500 Seeing if I drew this here more 

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:07.349
 Here you go and hit here so you have to 

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:09.719
 walk with the whole set and ends up 

00:07:07.349 --> 00:07:11.610
 Generating here is bad, right? 

00:07:09.719 --> 00:07:14.490
 I could bring this here very well. 

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:17.210
 but not stay here after empty 

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:22.020
 I thought I was practically leaving here 

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:24.990
 only the footprint becomes larger than the function 

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:28.169
 even the handlebars you get with a footprint 

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:31.650
 better wider and taller 

00:07:28.169 --> 00:07:33.479
 I already tested guidon, not in the city in the 

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:37.020
 or easily won the video on the 

00:07:33.479 --> 00:07:40.080
 transit to show is good 

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:42.659
 the very good footprint only really gives 

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:45.569
 more work in the corridor that walks 

00:07:42.659 --> 00:07:46.259
 bike in a day- to-day running gives more 

00:07:45.569 --> 00:07:49.879
 job 

00:07:46.259 --> 00:07:52.860
 I already hit twice on the dot with a 

00:07:49.879 --> 00:07:56.639
 rearview of car but hit Diego gave 

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:58.069
 one leaning against nothing but more 

00:07:56.639 --> 00:08:02.159
 really hard 

00:07:58.069 --> 00:08:03.839
 good I bought the new accessories there is 

00:08:02.159 --> 00:08:05.879
 so I posted it is posting here 

00:08:03.839 --> 00:08:07.940
 To show the people, it was worth it. 

00:08:05.879 --> 00:08:07.940
 hug
