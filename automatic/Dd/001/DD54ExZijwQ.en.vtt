00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
pathfinder which is not really a

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.410 
pathfinder which is not really a
pathfinder<00:00:07.980> anymore<00:00:08.820> it's<00:00:08.940> more<00:00:09.150> of<00:00:09.300> a

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
pathfinder anymore it's more of a

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.900 
pathfinder anymore it's more of a
wal-mart<00:00:10.380> finder<00:00:10.800> or<00:00:10.920> something<00:00:11.309> but<00:00:11.820> this

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
one is a 2013 pathfinder platinum so I

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.330 
one is a 2013 pathfinder platinum so I
thought<00:00:15.690> I<00:00:15.719> would<00:00:15.839> show<00:00:16.109> it<00:00:16.230> to<00:00:16.320> you<00:00:16.410> guys<00:00:16.470> you

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
thought I would show it to you guys you

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.680 
thought I would show it to you guys you
can<00:00:17.520> distinguish<00:00:17.880> a<00:00:17.940> platinum<00:00:18.359> by<00:00:18.480> these

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
can distinguish a platinum by these

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.109 
can distinguish a platinum by these
wheels<00:00:19.100> let's<00:00:20.100> see<00:00:20.310> what<00:00:20.460> size<00:00:20.670> they<00:00:20.910> are

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
wheels let's see what size they are

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.570 
wheels let's see what size they are
they<00:00:21.570> look<00:00:21.750> like<00:00:22.760> 235<00:00:23.760> 55<00:00:24.240> are<00:00:24.480> 20<00:00:24.900> cm<00:00:25.460> 20<00:00:26.460> inch

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
they look like 235 55 are 20 cm 20 inch

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.700 
they look like 235 55 are 20 cm 20 inch
that's<00:00:26.880> what<00:00:27.029> I<00:00:27.060> thought

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
that's what I thought

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.470 
that's what I thought
so<00:00:28.710> we'll<00:00:28.830> go<00:00:28.949> ahead<00:00:29.010> and<00:00:29.160> jump<00:00:29.519> inside<00:00:29.849> this

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
so we'll go ahead and jump inside this

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.930 
so we'll go ahead and jump inside this
is<00:00:30.660> like<00:00:30.810> in<00:00:30.960> this<00:00:31.279> gray<00:00:32.279> metallic<00:00:32.790> exterior
