reason<00:02:12.440> you<00:02:13.440> know<00:02:14.250> I<00:02:14.670> mean<00:02:15.110> there's<00:02:16.110> no<00:02:16.319> reason

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
reason you know I mean there's no reason

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.680 
reason you know I mean there's no reason
that<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:17.099> audience<00:02:17.310> doesn't<00:02:18.060> need<00:02:18.390> to<00:02:18.510> hear

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
that the audience doesn't need to hear

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.120 
that the audience doesn't need to hear
that<00:02:18.750> because<00:02:19.080> they're<00:02:19.560> going<00:02:19.709> to<00:02:19.800> hear<00:02:19.980> the

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
that because they're going to hear the

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.360 
that because they're going to hear the
sample<00:02:20.550> anyway<00:02:20.940> so<00:02:21.510> anyway<00:02:21.900> but<00:02:22.890> yeah<00:02:23.160> I<00:02:23.190> mean

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
sample anyway so anyway but yeah I mean

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.710 
sample anyway so anyway but yeah I mean
I<00:02:24.380> guess<00:02:25.380> it<00:02:25.800> is<00:02:26.010> more<00:02:26.459> about<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.790> music<00:02:27.030> than

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
I guess it is more about the music than

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.070 
I guess it is more about the music than
anything<00:02:28.230> else<00:02:28.670> if<00:02:29.670> it<00:02:30.269> sounds<00:02:30.599> good<00:02:30.780> hey<00:02:31.049> I

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
anything else if it sounds good hey I

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.160 
anything else if it sounds good hey I

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.979 
of guys they've gone onto CDs you know
they've<00:02:41.459> never<00:02:41.730> seen<00:02:42.000> vinyl<00:02:42.540> they've<00:02:42.750> never

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
they've never seen vinyl they've never

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.030 
they've never seen vinyl they've never
touched<00:02:43.319> final<00:02:44.660> they<00:02:45.660> just<00:02:45.930> consider<00:02:46.410> it<00:02:46.530> you

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
touched final they just consider it you

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.300 
touched final they just consider it you
know<00:02:47.190> old<00:02:47.610> and<00:02:48.150> dying<00:02:48.450> and<00:02:48.959> all<00:02:49.069> that's<00:02:50.069> for

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
know old and dying and all that's for

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.220 
know old and dying and all that's for
the<00:02:50.400> old<00:02:50.549> cronies<00:02:51.420> but<00:02:51.720> that's<00:02:51.900> probably

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
the old cronies but that's probably

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.380 
the old cronies but that's probably
because<00:02:52.410> they've<00:02:52.890> never<00:02:52.970> fucking<00:02:53.970> used<00:02:54.239> the

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
because they've never fucking used the

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.809 
because they've never fucking used the
turntable<00:02:55.190> you<00:02:56.190> know<00:02:56.370> and<00:02:56.579> they'd<00:02:56.670> never

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
mean technically you know the CDJ 1000

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:18.259 
mean technically you know the CDJ 1000
prior<00:03:13.889> to<00:03:14.160> serato<00:03:15.470> you<00:03:16.470> know<00:03:16.910> they<00:03:17.910> were<00:03:17.970> all

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
prior to serato you know they were all

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.099 
prior to serato you know they were all
cds<00:03:18.900> a<00:03:19.799> lot<00:03:20.250> of<00:03:20.340> guys<00:03:20.549> that<00:03:20.579> bought<00:03:20.819> them<00:03:21.450> were

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
cds a lot of guys that bought them were

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:24.979 
cds a lot of guys that bought them were
making<00:03:22.739> the<00:03:22.829> transition<00:03:23.250> from<00:03:23.459> vinyl<00:03:23.989> or

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
making the transition from vinyl or

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.220 
making the transition from vinyl or
using<00:03:25.410> them<00:03:25.560> as<00:03:25.739> an<00:03:25.859> accessory<00:03:26.190> to<00:03:26.489> vinyl<00:03:27.230> and

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
using them as an accessory to vinyl and

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.860 
using them as an accessory to vinyl and
i<00:03:28.410> will<00:03:30.109> definitely<00:03:31.109> admit<00:03:32.690> scratching<00:03:33.690> on

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
i will definitely admit scratching on

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.420 
i will definitely admit scratching on
the<00:03:34.040> 1000's<00:03:35.040> is<00:03:35.870> so<00:03:36.870> close<00:03:37.410> to<00:03:37.440> final<00:03:38.100> I<00:03:38.220> mean

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
the 1000's is so close to final I mean

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.729 
the 1000's is so close to final I mean
it's<00:03:38.670> sick<00:03:38.970> I<00:03:39.209> mean<00:03:39.450> other<00:03:39.870> than<00:03:40.200> the<00:03:40.380> wheel

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
it's sick I mean other than the wheel

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:45.190 
it's sick I mean other than the wheel
being<00:03:41.730> smaller<00:03:42.359> than<00:03:42.569> an<00:03:43.019> actual<00:03:43.639> 12-inch

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
being smaller than an actual 12-inch

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.770 
being smaller than an actual 12-inch
record<00:03:47.090> scratching<00:03:48.090> on<00:03:48.180> them<00:03:48.329> is<00:03:48.480> very

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
record scratching on them is very

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.979 
record scratching on them is very
similar<00:03:49.109> it<00:03:49.470> still<00:03:49.739> feels<00:03:50.010> very<00:03:50.310> natural<00:03:50.989> and

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
similar it still feels very natural and

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.410 
similar it still feels very natural and
I<00:03:52.680> would<00:03:52.859> say<00:03:53.069> that<00:03:53.099> I<00:03:53.400> scratching<00:03:53.940> equally<00:03:54.329> as

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
I would say that I scratching equally as

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.920 
I would say that I scratching equally as
well<00:03:54.660> on<00:03:54.959> the<00:03:55.079> 1000<00:03:55.709> as<00:03:55.829> I<00:03:55.950> do<00:03:56.090> on<00:03:57.090> the<00:03:57.359> vinyl

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
well on the 1000 as I do on the vinyl

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.960 
well on the 1000 as I do on the vinyl
your<00:03:58.769> hand<00:03:59.040> needs<00:03:59.280> to<00:03:59.400> be<00:03:59.519> a<00:03:59.549> little<00:03:59.790> bit

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
your hand needs to be a little bit

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.080 
your hand needs to be a little bit
quicker<00:04:00.709> because<00:04:01.709> of<00:04:02.069> the<00:04:02.190> you<00:04:02.700> know<00:04:02.730> the

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
quicker because of the you know the

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.449 
quicker because of the you know the
diameter<00:04:03.599> of<00:04:03.930> the<00:04:04.049> record<00:04:04.470> is<00:04:04.680> opposed<00:04:04.950> to<00:04:05.220> the

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
diameter of the record is opposed to the

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:08.900 
diameter of the record is opposed to the
CDJ<00:04:06.000> but<00:04:06.680> other<00:04:07.680> than<00:04:07.769> that<00:04:07.829> now<00:04:08.579> the<00:04:08.639> huge

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
CDJ but other than that now the huge

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.020 
CDJ but other than that now the huge
difference<00:04:09.359> is<00:04:10.430> great<00:04:11.430> if<00:04:11.670> you're<00:04:11.819> in<00:04:11.939> an

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
difference is great if you're in an

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.420 
difference is great if you're in an
environment<00:04:12.799> this<00:04:13.799> gets<00:04:14.069> a<00:04:14.189> lot

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
environment this gets a lot

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.469 
environment this gets a lot
and<00:04:14.840> you're<00:04:15.840> not<00:04:15.989> real<00:04:16.169> sure<00:04:16.199> the<00:04:16.560> surface<00:04:17.479> you

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
and you're not real sure the surface you

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.330 
and you're not real sure the surface you
know<00:04:18.630> where<00:04:18.989> if<00:04:19.259> you<00:04:19.350> have<00:04:19.470> bad<00:04:19.650> needles<00:04:20.100> you

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
know where if you have bad needles you

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.219 
know where if you have bad needles you
might<00:04:20.549> get<00:04:20.699> screwed<00:04:21.060> but<00:04:21.329> if<00:04:21.870> you<00:04:21.989> have<00:04:22.109> the

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
might get screwed but if you have the
