better job with that I was a dad once
lying<00:02:18.080> compared<00:02:18.590> to<00:02:18.770> that<00:02:18.950> sort<00:02:19.220> throwaway

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
lying compared to that sort throwaway

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.699 
lying compared to that sort throwaway
line<00:02:20.209> we<00:02:20.390> had<00:02:20.569> in<00:02:20.780> rings<00:02:21.020> of<00:02:21.110> akhaten<00:02:21.200> about

line we had in rings of akhaten about

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:22.900 
line we had in rings of akhaten about
the<00:02:21.800> doctor<00:02:22.069> bringing<00:02:22.400> his<00:02:22.490> granddaughter

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
the doctor bringing his granddaughter

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.089 
the doctor bringing his granddaughter
here<00:02:23.180> once<00:02:23.390> I<00:02:23.660> think<00:02:23.870> during<00:02:24.200> series<00:02:24.500> 7<00:02:25.010> the

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:25.099 
here once I think during series 7 the

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:26.470 
here once I think during series 7 the
show<00:02:25.280> had<00:02:25.400> found<00:02:25.610> itself<00:02:25.880> in<00:02:26.030> this<00:02:26.150> kind<00:02:26.390> of

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
show had found itself in this kind of

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.809 
show had found itself in this kind of
hellish<00:02:27.110> middle<00:02:27.500> ground<00:02:27.770> where<00:02:28.010> it<00:02:28.370> was<00:02:28.550> doing

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
hellish middle ground where it was doing

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:30.670 
hellish middle ground where it was doing
just<00:02:29.090> enough<00:02:29.270> to<00:02:29.510> isolate<00:02:29.959> the<00:02:30.050> casual<00:02:30.410> viewer

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
just enough to isolate the casual viewer

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.199 
just enough to isolate the casual viewer
but<00:02:30.920> not<00:02:31.130> quite<00:02:31.430> enough<00:02:31.580> to<00:02:31.880> appease

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
but not quite enough to appease

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:33.910 
but not quite enough to appease
Alzheimer's<00:02:32.990> now<00:02:33.410> I<00:02:33.440> kind<00:02:33.680> of<00:02:33.709> feel<00:02:33.770> like

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
Alzheimer's now I kind of feel like

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.140 
Alzheimer's now I kind of feel like
they've<00:02:34.130> gone<00:02:34.250> too<00:02:34.520> far<00:02:34.730> in<00:02:34.849> that<00:02:34.970> direction

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
they've gone too far in that direction

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.150 
they've gone too far in that direction
of<00:02:35.540> fanservice<00:02:35.959> where<00:02:36.380> you<00:02:36.800> know<00:02:36.950> not<00:02:37.130> only

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
of fanservice where you know not only

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.160 
of fanservice where you know not only
are<00:02:37.430> they<00:02:37.730> isolating<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:38.510> casual<00:02:38.810> viewer<00:02:38.989> but

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
are they isolating the casual viewer but

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.140 
are they isolating the casual viewer but
they're<00:02:39.349> also<00:02:39.560> kind<00:02:40.310> of<00:02:40.400> making<00:02:40.640> it<00:02:40.849> a<00:02:40.880> little

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
they're also kind of making it a little

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.880 
they're also kind of making it a little
bit<00:02:41.300> less<00:02:41.480> special<00:02:41.959> for<00:02:42.170> the<00:02:42.230> old-timers

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
bit less special for the old-timers

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.170 
bit less special for the old-timers
because<00:02:43.250> they're<00:02:43.370> showing<00:02:43.489> so<00:02:43.700> much<00:02:43.849> of<00:02:44.030> it

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
because they're showing so much of it

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.430 
because they're showing so much of it
that's<00:02:44.420> right<00:02:44.660> from<00:02:44.900> where<00:02:45.170> I'm<00:02:45.319> standing
