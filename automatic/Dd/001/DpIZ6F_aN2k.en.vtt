00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
that can be the first thing you need to

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.890 
that can be the first thing you need to

themselves<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.330> fact<00:00:30.599> that<00:00:30.689> they're

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
themselves to the fact that they're

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
do you do this I hear you ask you use

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.580 
do you do this I hear you ask you use
both<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.379> UAV<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.850> visa<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:55.079> UAV<00:00:55.469> is

both the UAV and of the visa the UAV is
self-explanatory<00:00:56.219> really<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:56.969> it<00:00:57.059> gives<00:00:57.270> you

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
mid-range scorestreaks and I'm sure you

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.560 
mid-range scorestreaks and I'm sure you
all<00:01:01.530> know<00:01:01.649> how<00:01:01.920> useful<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.370> VSAT<00:01:02.699> is<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.300> if

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
all know how useful the VSAT is and if

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.759 
all know how useful the VSAT is and if
you're<00:01:03.719> fast<00:01:03.930> enough<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:04.260> essentially<00:01:04.739> a

you're fast enough is essentially a

you're fast enough is essentially a

wallhack the toughest part is reaching

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.109 
wallhack the toughest part is reaching
the<00:01:07.530> VESA<00:01:07.920> once<00:01:08.220> you've<00:01:08.369> done<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.909> last

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
the VESA once you've done that the last

few points you need to reach the highest
gospel<00:01:10.950> much<00:01:11.520> easier<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.119> get<00:01:12.270> now<00:01:13.170> possibly

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
gospel much easier to get now possibly

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.410 
gospel much easier to get now possibly
the<00:01:14.130> most<00:01:14.310> important<00:01:14.760> way<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:14.909> earn<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:15.210> high

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
the most important way to earn a high

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.810 
the most important way to earn a high
scroll<00:01:15.810> streak<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.170> by<00:01:16.320> using<00:01:16.530> hardline<00:01:17.070> this

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
scroll streak is by using hardline this

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.370 
scroll streak is by using hardline this
is<00:01:17.939> probably<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.360> most<00:01:18.509> underrated<00:01:18.900> perk

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
is probably the most underrated perk

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.109 
is probably the most underrated perk
there<00:01:19.619> is<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:19.979> very<00:01:20.130> few<00:01:20.460> people<00:01:20.610> use<00:01:20.939> it

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
there is and very few people use it

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.630 
there is and very few people use it
instead<00:01:21.689> preferring<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.409> equip<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.830> grenade<00:01:23.430> or

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
instead preferring to equip a grenade or

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.090 
instead preferring to equip a grenade or
simply<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.630> different<00:01:24.960> more<00:01:25.229> noticeable<00:01:25.799> perk

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
simply a different more noticeable perk

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.070 
simply a different more noticeable perk
most<00:01:27.030> people<00:01:27.330> don't<00:01:27.540> feel<00:01:27.720> much<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:27.960> a

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
most people don't feel much of a

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.749 
most people don't feel much of a
difference<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:28.740> this<00:01:28.979> is<00:01:29.040> because<00:01:29.400> hardline

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
difference and this is because hardline

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.609 
difference and this is because hardline
works<00:01:30.060> better<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:31.049> further<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.500> the

works better the further of the

scorestreak list you are for example
it's<00:01:34.110> only<00:01:34.259> one<00:01:34.530> kill<00:01:34.829> less<00:01:35.070> than<00:01:35.430> normal<00:01:35.729> to

it's only one kill less than normal to
