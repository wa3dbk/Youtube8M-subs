rapid<00:00:01.490> climate<00:00:01.910> change<00:00:02.179> is<00:00:02.420> a<00:00:02.480> big<00:00:02.840> problem

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:03.189 
rapid climate change is a big problem

00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:06.249 
rapid climate change is a big problem
luckily<00:00:04.189> it's<00:00:04.430> one<00:00:04.819> we<00:00:04.970> can<00:00:05.000> tackle<00:00:05.480> but<00:00:06.170> it

00:00:06.249 --> 00:00:06.259 
luckily it's one we can tackle but it

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:07.960 
luckily it's one we can tackle but it
will<00:00:06.350> take<00:00:06.589> the<00:00:06.740> work<00:00:06.920> of<00:00:07.190> every<00:00:07.520> nation<00:00:07.700> on

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:07.970 
will take the work of every nation on

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.240 
will take the work of every nation on
earth<00:00:08.200> especially<00:00:09.200> the<00:00:09.349> ones<00:00:09.559> with<00:00:09.679> lots<00:00:10.040> of

power plants cars factories and other
things<00:00:12.980> that<00:00:13.130> use<00:00:13.429> lots<00:00:13.759> of<00:00:13.940> energy<00:00:14.120> as<00:00:14.540> you

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:14.900 
things that use lots of energy as you

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.740 
things that use lots of energy as you
can<00:00:15.259> see<00:00:15.500> China<00:00:16.070> and<00:00:16.400> the<00:00:16.550> United<00:00:16.699> States<00:00:17.270> make

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.750 
can see China and the United States make

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:20.050 
can see China and the United States make
most<00:00:18.080> of<00:00:18.350> the<00:00:18.470> carbon<00:00:18.800> dioxide<00:00:18.830> that<00:00:19.369> means

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:20.060 
most of the carbon dioxide that means

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:22.150 
most of the carbon dioxide that means
the<00:00:20.270> leaders<00:00:20.570> of<00:00:20.600> those<00:00:20.869> nations<00:00:21.439> along<00:00:21.920> with

the leaders of those nations along with
the<00:00:22.279> others<00:00:22.550> have<00:00:23.029> a<00:00:23.060> special<00:00:23.600> responsibility

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
the others have a special responsibility

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:26.710 
the others have a special responsibility
to<00:00:24.560> reduce<00:00:25.070> carbon<00:00:25.369> dioxide<00:00:26.029> and<00:00:26.269> keep<00:00:26.570> the

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:26.720 
to reduce carbon dioxide and keep the

to reduce carbon dioxide and keep the
planet<00:00:26.990> livable<00:00:27.439> in<00:00:27.680> the<00:00:27.800> future<00:00:28.160> by<00:00:28.760> now<00:00:28.970> you

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:29.480 
planet livable in the future by now you

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.179 
planet livable in the future by now you
understand<00:00:30.080> that<00:00:30.260> having<00:00:30.590> a<00:00:30.679> planet<00:00:31.039> with<00:00:31.160> a

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 
understand that having a planet with a

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:33.340 
understand that having a planet with a
stable<00:00:31.640> climate<00:00:31.789> means<00:00:32.449> reducing<00:00:32.960> the<00:00:33.079> amount

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
stable climate means reducing the amount

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.440 
stable climate means reducing the amount
of<00:00:33.440> carbon<00:00:33.829> dioxide<00:00:33.860> in<00:00:34.370> the<00:00:34.579> atmosphere<00:00:34.610> to

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.410 
of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to
350<00:00:36.380> parts<00:00:36.559> per<00:00:36.770> million<00:00:37.100> so<00:00:37.850> how<00:00:38.000> do<00:00:38.059> we<00:00:38.180> get

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
350 parts per million so how do we get

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.240 
350 parts per million so how do we get
there<00:00:38.690> there<00:00:39.230> are<00:00:39.379> actually<00:00:39.829> lots<00:00:39.860> of

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
there there are actually lots of

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.610 
there there are actually lots of
solutions<00:00:40.579> and<00:00:41.059> like<00:00:41.360> a<00:00:41.390> puzzle<00:00:41.719> when<00:00:42.290> you<00:00:42.410> put

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
solutions and like a puzzle when you put

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.619 
solutions and like a puzzle when you put
all<00:00:42.800> the<00:00:42.950> pieces<00:00:43.160> together<00:00:43.489> they<00:00:44.090> create<00:00:44.450> the

all the pieces together they create the

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:46.990 
all the pieces together they create the

instead of burning coal oil and gas to
make<00:00:56.239> energy<00:00:56.449> we<00:00:57.199> can<00:00:57.410> start<00:00:57.649> using<00:00:57.829> more

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
make energy we can start using more

for<00:01:45.680> example<00:01:46.159> governments<00:01:47.149> can<00:01:47.329> require<00:01:47.659> that

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
for example governments can require that
