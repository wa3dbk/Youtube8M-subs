00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
subtle so we're using a brown one today

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.349 
subtle so we're using a brown one today
instead<00:03:11.680> of<00:03:11.799> a<00:03:11.950> real<00:03:12.130> bright<00:03:12.370> one<00:03:12.400> what

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:13.359 
instead of a real bright one what

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:14.970 
instead of a real bright one what
they're<00:03:13.510> feeding<00:03:13.720> on<00:03:13.930> is<00:03:14.200> you<00:03:14.500> know<00:03:14.590> a<00:03:14.620> lot<00:03:14.859> of

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
they're feeding on is you know a lot of

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.720 
they're feeding on is you know a lot of
nymphs<00:03:15.220> a<00:03:15.549> lot<00:03:15.760> of<00:03:15.910> zooplankton<00:03:16.739> and<00:03:17.739> the

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
nymphs a lot of zooplankton and the

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.879 
nymphs a lot of zooplankton and the
colors<00:03:19.000> are<00:03:19.120> real<00:03:19.269> muted<00:03:19.690> but<00:03:20.350> the<00:03:20.500> key<00:03:20.709> to

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:20.889 
colors are real muted but the key to

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:22.890 
colors are real muted but the key to
this<00:03:21.100> whole<00:03:21.160> thing<00:03:21.340> I<00:03:21.880> think<00:03:22.359> anyway<00:03:22.630> is<00:03:22.750> this

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
this whole thing I think anyway is this

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.080 
this whole thing I think anyway is this
tail<00:03:23.170> on<00:03:23.440> this<00:03:23.620> on<00:03:23.799> this<00:03:23.920> little<00:03:24.100> bait<00:03:24.400> I<00:03:24.670> think

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
tail on this on this little bait I think

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.670 
tail on this on this little bait I think
the<00:03:25.209> thing<00:03:25.389> that's<00:03:25.600> really<00:03:25.810> key<00:03:26.230> for<00:03:26.590> these

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
the thing that's really key for these

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.250 
the thing that's really key for these
trout<00:03:26.980> in<00:03:27.130> the<00:03:27.190> winter<00:03:27.400> time<00:03:27.579> is<00:03:27.880> a<00:03:28.720> thin

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
trout in the winter time is a thin

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.620 
trout in the winter time is a thin
tapering<00:03:29.950> tail<00:03:30.250> on<00:03:30.519> a<00:03:30.549> plastic<00:03:31.120> because<00:03:31.450> they

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
tapering tail on a plastic because they

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.860 
tapering tail on a plastic because they
just<00:03:31.840> seem<00:03:32.200> to<00:03:32.230> really<00:03:33.069> key<00:03:33.489> on<00:03:33.870> constant

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
just seem to really key on constant

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.780 
just seem to really key on constant
motion<00:03:35.079> on<00:03:35.500> something<00:03:36.220> that<00:03:36.340> just<00:03:36.519> constantly

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
motion on something that just constantly

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.599 
motion on something that just constantly
flaps<00:03:37.510> like<00:03:37.810> this<00:03:38.019> little<00:03:38.230> rat<00:03:38.440> so<00:03:38.709> tail<00:03:38.980> it

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:39.609 
flaps like this little rat so tail it

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:41.759 
flaps like this little rat so tail it
