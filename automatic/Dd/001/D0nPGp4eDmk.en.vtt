00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.310
 very well standing we see your perfect 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.770
 interest 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.900
 as another and is a team with good 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.280
 individualities of the team that was 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.010
 until the potentially well unemployed 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.869
 he was not allowed to play with that freedom 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:20.700
 that where I am more dangerous and 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:23.009
 important it cost us to generate plays 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.710
 but the important thing was to be ordered to 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:27.660
 be a good team or do the whole team 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.079
 sorry and the team is a great effort and 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.079
 in the end 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:42.670
 if the team has worked well 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.250
 help us at this time and have 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:51.769
 demonstrated temper to be in the 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.820
 moment that is required 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:57.829
 the experience people is also 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:01:01.129
 important like that 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:04.850
 and well that 's important what goes away 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:06.890
 forming a good group and still with the 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.370
 team absences like this 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.140
 and good on time 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.560
 we achieved the three points that were very 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.560
 important 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.780
 because it was recognized that's why we brought it 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.470
 is a player of great speed is 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.470
 dangerous that 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:30.549
 he did not need help stops for 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.990
 defend also and attack with much 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:35.659
 dangerousness then 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.740
 so that little by little they leave 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:38.060
 integrating the others go away 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.600
 finding out they are understanding the 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.600
 we can be a team 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.540
 Well, yes, reaching to the other 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.540
 side 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:03.570
 and this 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:05.480
 we're going to have to find a solution 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.500
 for the next match the best 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.060
 regardless of that, enter 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.660
 spend your christ a lot around the 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.660
 institutions 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:22.700
 It is of course important and I think it 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.710
 you say these advantages are not and we do not 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.050
 we are to give no advantage to 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:29.540
 We do not talk about any team 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:32.970
 importance of numbers 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:43.580
 good cards was given that way 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:47.510
 let's hope that in the video I do not know anything 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.710
 I do not intend to do anything later to try 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.170
 of the team recovering because it is 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.590
 a great effort and think after 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.590
 this match 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:57.750
 then there is the possibility 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:05.439
 you have to talk about it well try 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:08.049
 make good choices that will give someone 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:10.409
 so that it really comes as reinforcement 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.409
 help to 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.090
 administrative issues 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:28.709
 just as cool young today was 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.709
 necessary for the inspiring charge 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:34.450
 totally not if it's a thing that gives 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.860
 an important presence to the team 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.680
 selected 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:42.040
 very important side his presence the 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.500
 young people, little by little they will go 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.799
 being part of the team but neither 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.799
 it is 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:54.000
 in case there is 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.069
 brands found inspiration 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:13.910
 to find the time of most the 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:15.400
 expression but good I learned to 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:20.259
 drive 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:21.940
 along and we have to do 

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:23.730
 What our work does not have to us 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:32.420
 distract us 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:32.420
 work of the season 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.790
 improve paying more attention to all 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:53.660
 I hope not much I hope that many in 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:55.500
 the player but right now what I want is 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.300
 to play as a team 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:01.160
 there are people who have a lot of quality 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:04.160
 also this 90 as I see it when I'm 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.160
 full 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:18.120
 is 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:21.060
 in the day to day work of all 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.310
 the days the partner that goes well 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.979
 but now we all have to continue with 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.240
 our path because it already started and now 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:31.160
 is 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.160
 we have to strengthen ourselves 

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:42.150
 If I want nothing happens, that's things 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.630
 normal within the party I do not believe 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.910
 that will be there 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.440
 the communication that there is sometimes does not have 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:51.730
 have to show their character so that 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:56.530
 others also the same other colleagues 

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:56.530
 it's not natural I like it
