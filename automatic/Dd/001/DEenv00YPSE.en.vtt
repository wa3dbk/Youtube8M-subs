00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.890
 the end of some sera mari carmen 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:10.060
 we hear your opinion about the duo very 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.060
 good attitude of the two 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:19.340
 marc patina wench and nothing else 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:21.610
 with an already serious detunement in the other 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:25.759
 in the second start too 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:27.289
 total detune I think tito today has 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:28.610
 been your night you were impeccable in the 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:30.420
 duo 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.060
 what yes 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.160
 I have to recognize is that none of 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.590
 both lost the character 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.190
 marc at marc anthony and tito en tito 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.370
 snow very very well on that side 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.850
 but otherwise we have been so 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.249
 we did not know what was going to happen 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.589
 thank you very much bad and carnet people 

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:54.379
 applauds and that people chanted 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:57.710
 song but like people people that 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:01:00.540
 know in salsa know this song 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:04.150
 bauer to all 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:06.250
 fernando armas we hear your opinion if 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:10.500
 to this duel I saw more committed between 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:12.700
 I saw both more more of more releases 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.110
 certainly my friend marc seems that at 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.470
 home did not want to sing like hector 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.910
 lavoe 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.290
 that is rather not want this 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.270
 singer hector the voice but then already 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.580
 was getting into the character that is very 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.620
 important to keep it in these in these 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.230
 two I think with a little more trial 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:29.740
 this song would have gone better 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:31.480
 thank you so much for seeing something 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.880
 something is happening a little more than rehearsal 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.690
 when song time one day less 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.270
 of a different day now only hours 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:42.390
 the challenge that duos do in the 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.910
 same day that is the challenge that is the challenge 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.720
 and so it's what we have to do is 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:51.270
 perfect ricardo morán we hear it is 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.330
 correct what they say and also that 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.250
 the public knows the challenge of the duos 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.470
 is that they are prepared on the same day as the 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.790
 presentation to a large extent also 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:04.050
 because as we are eliminating 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.550
 participants every two days is one never 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.680
 he knows who he's going to play with and that's 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.720
 part of the difficulty and sing a 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.580
 song that is not of both singers 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.470
 necessarily to see how they achieve 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.600
 sustain the interpretation the 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.240
 characterization the imitation the tone of 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.340
 voice et cetera etcetera in a context that 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.260
 is not the proper of that is the 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.630
 exercise and that's why it's a very 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.850
 difficult and that's why we always leave 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.350
 we have waited for the end of the season 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.450
 to have it when they are more 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.580
 hot when they have more hours more 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.290
 mileage on stage without 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.590
 But I have to say that the 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.190
 results have been a little bit reduced 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.190
 the present day 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.330
 you do not hear me 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.350
 they do not hear me like I'm going to say 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.350
 obviously there have been deflections 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:54.200
 from part of the sea ​​that have been very clear 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.060
 I feel that Tito has come out more graceful not 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.850
 I believe that when Marc Anthony is 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.580
 true did the movie in which 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:04.100
 actor interprets side imitated aitor in 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:07.850
 this song is not why there has been a 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:10.040
 frightened but but I think that whistle has been 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:14.150
 a little more curd more solvent in 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.220
 the song I agree that the theme 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.170
 physical movement on stage if 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.240
 both have sustained their characters 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.420
 but technically as we do with the 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.500
 detune can not do not I do not know what 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.840
 is what we are going to do 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.090
 artists that are all at very high levels 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.340
 similar when the time comes for the 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.470
 elimination will be very difficult for 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:36.290
 us today thanks guys 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:39.610
 very difficult for you today 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.610
 please to take a seat
