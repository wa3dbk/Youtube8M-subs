00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
that's what all these pieces are it

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.550 
that's what all these pieces are it
looks<00:01:38.430> like

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.649 

and<00:01:42.560> there's<00:01:43.220> also<00:01:43.460> a<00:01:43.670> couple<00:01:43.880> minifigures

and there's also a couple minifigures
included<00:01:48.250> so<00:01:49.250> that's<00:01:49.430> kind<00:01:49.670> of<00:01:49.729> cool

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:50.710 
included so that's kind of cool

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:59.969 
included so that's kind of cool
okay<00:01:51.710> and<00:01:53.229> then<00:01:54.229> this<00:01:54.740> large<00:01:55.070> bag<00:01:55.340> right<00:01:55.729> here

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:07.660 

these<00:02:00.979> are<00:02:02.470> the<00:02:03.470> large<00:02:06.310> rode<00:02:07.310> plates

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
these are the large rode plates

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.940 
these are the large rode plates
basically<00:02:09.819> well<00:02:10.819> that<00:02:11.360> necessarily<00:02:11.810> rode<00:02:12.170> but

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
basically well that necessarily rode but

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.830 
basically well that necessarily rode but
I<00:02:13.250> think<00:02:13.970> of<00:02:14.060> them<00:02:14.180> as<00:02:14.330> bridge<00:02:14.810> plates<00:02:15.230> and<00:02:16.840> so

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
I think of them as bridge plates and so

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.559 
I think of them as bridge plates and so
this<00:02:18.019> is<00:02:18.170> what<00:02:18.350> will<00:02:18.650> form<00:02:18.980> my<00:02:19.190> other<00:02:19.400> dock<00:02:19.790> so

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
this is what will form my other dock so

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.120 
this is what will form my other dock so
I'll<00:02:20.690> have<00:02:20.810> two<00:02:21.080> identical<00:02:21.470> docks<00:02:21.860> and<00:02:22.989> then

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
I'll have two identical docks and then

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:30.280 
I'll have two identical docks and then
here's<00:02:25.130> the<00:02:26.680> girder<00:02:27.680> pieces<00:02:28.870> these<00:02:29.870> are<00:02:29.930> in

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
here's the girder pieces these are in

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.780 
here's the girder pieces these are in
pretty<00:02:30.709> good<00:02:30.800> shape<00:02:30.950> even<00:02:32.680> after<00:02:33.680> coming<00:02:34.549> all

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
pretty good shape even after coming all

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.630 
pretty good shape even after coming all
the<00:02:34.910> way<00:02:35.590> overseas<00:02:36.590> the<00:02:36.890> stickers<00:02:37.280> are<00:02:37.489> well

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
the way overseas the stickers are well

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.400 
the way overseas the stickers are well
applied<00:02:38.000> too<00:02:38.299> so<00:02:38.569> that's<00:02:38.750> nice

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
applied too so that's nice

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.360 
applied too so that's nice
they're<00:02:39.920> nice<00:02:40.130> and<00:02:40.370> straight<00:02:40.700> and<00:02:41.739> then<00:02:42.739> also

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
they're nice and straight and then also

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:49.990 
they're nice and straight and then also
get<00:02:44.950> three<00:02:45.950> of<00:02:46.160> these<00:02:47.049> so<00:02:48.049> that's<00:02:48.200> pretty<00:02:49.000> cool

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
get three of these so that's pretty cool

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.630 
get three of these so that's pretty cool
and<00:02:50.380> then<00:02:51.380> this<00:02:51.500> is<00:02:51.680> the<00:02:51.799> main<00:02:52.010> reason<00:02:52.250> that<00:02:52.459> I

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
and then this is the main reason that I

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.539 
and then this is the main reason that I
started<00:02:53.150> this<00:02:53.299> order<00:02:53.690> was<00:02:54.410> to<00:02:54.440> get<00:02:54.829> these<00:02:55.100> I

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549 
started this order was to get these I

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:57.550 
started this order was to get these I
needed<00:02:56.090> new<00:02:56.239> stickers<00:02:56.660> for<00:02:56.959> my<00:02:57.019> container

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
needed new stickers for my container

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.120 
needed new stickers for my container
ship<00:02:57.890> because<00:02:58.519> they<00:02:58.700> were<00:02:58.760> peeling<00:02:59.380> as<00:03:00.380> with

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
ship because they were peeling as with

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.819 
ship because they were peeling as with
several<00:03:02.120> other<00:03:02.299> of<00:03:02.480> my<00:03:02.510> sets<00:03:03.019> that<00:03:03.200> I<00:03:03.290> have<00:03:03.320> so

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:06.880 
I'm trying to go through and replace
them<00:03:06.049> and<00:03:06.200> they're<00:03:06.290> fairly<00:03:06.470> expensive

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
them and they're fairly expensive

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.009 
them and they're fairly expensive
usually<00:03:07.220> but<00:03:07.910> I<00:03:07.940> was<00:03:08.090> able<00:03:08.180> to<00:03:08.299> get<00:03:08.480> these<00:03:08.630> for

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
usually but I was able to get these for

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:11.890 
usually but I was able to get these for
I<00:03:09.049> think<00:03:09.940> seven<00:03:10.940> or<00:03:11.030> eight<00:03:11.090> dollars<00:03:11.299> and<00:03:11.810> it

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
I think seven or eight dollars and it

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.630 
I think seven or eight dollars and it
worked<00:03:12.079> out<00:03:12.200> well<00:03:12.410> because<00:03:12.440> these<00:03:13.400> are<00:03:13.549> the

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
worked out well because these are the

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.660 
worked out well because these are the
only<00:03:13.790> ones<00:03:14.030> that<00:03:14.299> I<00:03:14.329> needed<00:03:14.600> is<00:03:14.900> just<00:03:14.930> the<00:03:15.260> ones

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
only ones that I needed is just the ones

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.789 
only ones that I needed is just the ones
that<00:03:16.670> go<00:03:16.820> for<00:03:17.030> the<00:03:17.120> boat<00:03:17.299> and<00:03:17.540> those<00:03:18.500> are<00:03:18.709> the

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
that go for the boat and those are the

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:20.470 
that go for the boat and those are the
only<00:03:18.890> ones<00:03:19.160> left<00:03:19.489> on<00:03:19.700> the<00:03:19.790> sticker<00:03:20.000> sheet<00:03:20.239> so

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
only ones left on the sticker sheet so

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.620 
only ones left on the sticker sheet so
that<00:03:20.510> worked<00:03:20.840> out<00:03:20.989> well<00:03:21.049> so<00:03:21.530> I<00:03:22.040> already

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
that worked out well so I already

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.849 
that worked out well so I already

trying<00:04:36.480> to<00:04:36.540> decide<00:04:36.900> I<00:04:37.230> try<00:04:37.830> to<00:04:37.890> use<00:04:38.040> a<00:04:38.070> soccer

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
trying to decide I try to use a soccer

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.930 
trying to decide I try to use a soccer
ball<00:04:38.550> for<00:04:38.880> that<00:04:38.910> or<00:04:39.270> do<00:04:39.660> I<00:04:39.720> just<00:04:40.430> use<00:04:41.430> a<00:04:41.460> white

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
ball for that or do I just use a white

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.550 
ball for that or do I just use a white
minifigure<00:04:42.570> head<00:04:42.780> but<00:04:43.020> in<00:04:43.140> the<00:04:43.230> end<00:04:43.350> I<00:04:43.440> decided

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
minifigure head but in the end I decided

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.310 
minifigure head but in the end I decided
to<00:04:43.920> go<00:04:44.040> like<00:04:44.220> this<00:04:44.940> tried<00:04:45.690> to<00:04:45.810> find<00:04:46.020> the<00:04:46.170> one

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
that looked the closest to a volleyball

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.760 
that looked the closest to a volleyball
