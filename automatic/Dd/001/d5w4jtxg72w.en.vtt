fifth okay so that's one kind of element
of<00:00:46.890> all<00:00:47.100> this<00:00:47.280> then<00:00:48.059> we<00:00:48.149> talked<00:00:48.390> about<00:00:48.510> how

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
of all this then we talked about how

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.720 
of all this then we talked about how
with<00:00:49.200> now<00:00:49.649> with<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.890> other<00:00:50.010> fingers<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.610> can

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
with now with the other fingers you can

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.420 
with now with the other fingers you can
either<00:00:50.910> play<00:00:51.149> on<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.570> beat<00:00:51.780> like<00:00:52.160> like<00:00:53.160> this

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
either play on the beat like like this

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.110 
either play on the beat like like this
that's<00:00:54.360> playing<00:00:54.660> on<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.020> beat<00:00:55.850> or<00:00:56.850> you<00:00:56.940> can

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
that's playing on the beat or you can

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.560 
that's playing on the beat or you can
syncopated<00:00:57.870> which<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.440> off<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.820> beat

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
syncopated which is off the beat

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.289 
syncopated which is off the beat
thump<00:01:02.170> hasn't<00:01:02.560> changed

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:08.090 

and<00:01:06.299> notice<00:01:06.600> how<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:07.140> can<00:01:07.619> change<00:01:07.829> the

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
and notice how you can change the

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.639 
and notice how you can change the
sequence<00:01:08.549> of<00:01:08.640> these<00:01:08.790> notes<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:10.320> sounds

00:01:10.639 --> 00:01:10.649 
sequence of these notes and it sounds

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:14.920 
sequence of these notes and it sounds
different<00:01:10.860> so<00:01:11.130> now<00:01:11.159> can<00:01:11.460> go

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.960 

same<00:01:15.620> notes<00:01:15.920> just<00:01:16.220> kind<00:01:16.490> of<00:01:16.550> a<00:01:16.640> different

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
same notes just kind of a different

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:38.080 
same notes just kind of a different
pattern<00:01:18.400> oops

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.020 

right<00:01:38.780> so<00:01:38.990> I'm<00:01:39.079> playing<00:01:39.320> same<00:01:40.189> notes<00:01:40.460> just<00:01:40.850> do

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
right so I'm playing same notes just do

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.600 
right so I'm playing same notes just do
it<00:01:41.090> in<00:01:41.210> different<00:01:41.299> ways<00:01:41.659> and<00:01:42.220> to<00:01:43.220> me<00:01:43.369> that's

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
it in different ways and to me that's

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:44.980 
it in different ways and to me that's
really<00:01:43.700> the<00:01:43.970> key<00:01:44.149> of<00:01:44.270> learning<00:01:44.570> how<00:01:44.659> to<00:01:44.689> become

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
really the key of learning how to become

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.810 
really the key of learning how to become
a<00:01:45.020> good<00:01:45.200> finger<00:01:45.560> picker<00:01:45.770> is<00:01:46.070> to<00:01:46.340> really<00:01:46.549> just

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:46.820 
a good finger picker is to really just

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.029 
a good finger picker is to really just
become<00:01:47.420> comfortable<00:01:48.020> and<00:01:48.200> fluent<00:01:48.590> and<00:01:48.680> doing

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:49.039 
become comfortable and fluent and doing

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:50.370 
become comfortable and fluent and doing
things<00:01:49.310> in<00:01:49.490> a<00:01:49.549> lot<00:01:49.729> of<00:01:49.759> different<00:01:50.180> ways

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
things in a lot of different ways

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.270 
things in a lot of different ways
because<00:01:51.380> then<00:01:51.500> the<00:01:51.590> next<00:01:51.619> step<00:01:51.950> is<00:01:52.070> to<00:01:52.159> learn

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
because then the next step is to learn

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.330 
because then the next step is to learn
how<00:01:52.340> to<00:01:52.520> combine<00:01:52.759> them<00:01:53.180> okay<00:01:54.080> so<00:01:54.140> rather<00:01:55.100> than

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
how to combine them okay so rather than

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.399 
how to combine them okay so rather than
saying<00:01:55.580> all<00:01:55.939> right<00:01:56.090> well<00:01:56.330> okay<00:01:56.600> my<00:01:57.170> thumb's

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
saying all right well okay my thumb's

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.070 
saying all right well okay my thumb's
gonna<00:01:57.649> be<00:01:57.740> doing<00:01:58.039> you<00:01:58.520> know<00:01:58.549> root<00:01:59.000> v<00:01:59.450> or<00:01:59.750> root

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
hold a C chord on my right hand but I'm

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.809 
hold a C chord on my right hand but I'm
just<00:02:11.540> gonna<00:02:11.720> start<00:02:12.080> kind<00:02:12.620> of<00:02:12.819> preformed

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
just gonna start kind of preformed

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:15.699 
just gonna start kind of preformed
creatively<00:02:14.390> combining<00:02:15.019> all<00:02:15.230> these<00:02:15.410> elements

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
creatively combining all these elements

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:16.960 
creatively combining all these elements
that<00:02:16.010> we've<00:02:16.160> been<00:02:16.340> talking<00:02:16.640> about<00:02:16.730> already

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
that we've been talking about already

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:27.670 
that we've been talking about already
with<00:02:17.450> the<00:02:17.540> right<00:02:17.690> hand<00:02:17.959> so

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.679 

so<00:02:28.430> that<00:02:28.879> might<00:02:29.030> seem<00:02:29.239> a<00:02:29.299> little<00:02:29.420> complicated

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:29.689 
so that might seem a little complicated

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:32.890 
so that might seem a little complicated
but<00:02:30.409> it's<00:02:30.980> really<00:02:31.310> not<00:02:31.489> all<00:02:31.790> I've<00:02:31.970> all<00:02:32.299> I'd<00:02:32.480> you

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
but it's really not all I've all I'd you

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.929 
but it's really not all I've all I'd you
know<00:02:32.930> all<00:02:33.620> I'm<00:02:33.829> doing<00:02:34.129> is<00:02:34.250> sometimes<00:02:34.760> I'm

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:34.939 
know all I'm doing is sometimes I'm

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:37.000 
know all I'm doing is sometimes I'm
playing<00:02:35.209> on<00:02:35.480> the<00:02:35.659> beat<00:02:35.840> with<00:02:36.349> the<00:02:36.560> other<00:02:36.680> three

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
playing on the beat with the other three

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.289 
playing on the beat with the other three
fingers<00:02:37.159> and<00:02:37.340> sometimes<00:02:37.790> I'm<00:02:37.879> playing<00:02:38.090> off

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
fingers and sometimes I'm playing off

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.690 
fingers and sometimes I'm playing off
the<00:02:38.450> beat<00:02:38.629> syncopated<00:02:39.379> and<00:02:39.530> you<00:02:40.519> know<00:02:40.610> I've

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
the beat syncopated and you know I've

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.059 
the beat syncopated and you know I've
practiced<00:02:41.150> enough<00:02:41.390> where<00:02:41.750> you<00:02:42.530> know<00:02:42.650> it<00:02:42.829> just

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
practiced enough where you know it just

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.099 
practiced enough where you know it just
kind<00:02:43.370> of<00:02:43.400> becomes<00:02:43.730> second<00:02:44.510> nature<00:02:44.540> after<00:02:44.930> a

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:45.109 
kind of becomes second nature after a

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:47.110 
kind of becomes second nature after a
while<00:02:45.319> to<00:02:45.680> know<00:02:45.829> that<00:02:46.010> your<00:02:46.129> thumb<00:02:46.400> is<00:02:46.640> just

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
while to know that your thumb is just

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.420 
while to know that your thumb is just
kind<00:02:47.390> of<00:02:47.450> doing<00:02:47.750> this<00:02:47.840> bassline<00:02:48.439> and<00:02:48.709> your

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
kind of doing this bassline and your

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.679 
kind of doing this bassline and your
other<00:02:49.549> fingers<00:02:49.879> can<00:02:50.060> play<00:02:50.209> on<00:02:50.420> the<00:02:50.569> beat

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:50.689 
other fingers can play on the beat

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:53.470 
other fingers can play on the beat
sometimes<00:02:51.200> or<00:02:51.470> syncopated<00:02:52.129> and<00:02:52.310> just<00:02:53.239> kind<00:02:53.420> of

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
sometimes or syncopated and just kind of

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.670 
sometimes or syncopated and just kind of
learn<00:02:53.599> how<00:02:53.720> to<00:02:53.750> combine<00:02:53.989> things<00:02:54.379> in<00:02:54.560> different

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
learn how to combine things in different

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.500 
learn how to combine things in different
ways<00:02:54.920> again<00:02:55.340> I'm<00:02:55.489> not<00:02:55.609> changing<00:02:55.909> my<00:02:56.120> left<00:02:56.329> hand

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
ways again I'm not changing my left hand

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:18.300 
ways again I'm not changing my left hand
at<00:02:56.629> all
