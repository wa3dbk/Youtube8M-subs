00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.870
 in laboratory testing 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.880
 controls just exactly now 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.700
 if testing the prototypes of the 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.380
 xbox world controls which is very 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.779
 interesting has happened a lot said this is not 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.090
 our final product is a prototype 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:28.330
 temente attack us buttons are not 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.189
 the end because they are highlighted black 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.650
 there are many sides are not here do not have 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:34.330
 the logo here presents nothing but is a 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.400
 very good approximation of what of what 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:39.940
 that will be found much more 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:43.210
 ergonomic 11 a quick comparison of the 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:46.629
 3.60 current control committee with 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.489
 this from xbox to start the first 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:51.879
 when the first fundamental change that 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:54.040
 we see is that of peace that is clear to us 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:55.629
 We have complained much of this of this type 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.049
 the truth right now they did not return something 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:00.879
 much much more comfortable which I think 

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:03.339
 will be fundamental for games of 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:06.480
 fights with that while the rest that 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:12.490
 we love juanes 30 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:15.070
 let's grab with one hand is a lot 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.590
 more brother hit me when I want 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:21.040
 make the control poster require the 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:23.740
 Indians are this the batteries something 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.590
 when you put your hand one tourism like no 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.240
 I can do this I have here and 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.970
 simply because now yes these years already 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:34.510
 everything now while I do it in this 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:39.040
 control as your hand totally the 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:40.420
 back and because I did not have the cockpit 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.740
 so that the battery has changed 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.740
 they just grabbed this 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.040
 horizontal here one of the things 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.920
 interesting is that obviously here says 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.180
 prototype here we have the batteries but 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.620
 we do not know what will happen to the 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.000
 iron shock mind there is nothing 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.620
 do us right now but right now 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.450
 this plan is already leaving the port 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.120
 usb I do not know exactly what is connected 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.260
 to this end it is very impressive 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.890
 so next is we're going to 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.660
 comment 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.940
 they still have here and then control 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.830
 we have the triggers that look like 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:16.060
 put a lot more stylized 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:17.740
 nicest the normal lb lb and lb for 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.190
 the analogs are very interesting because 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:23.410
 the next thing besides they are a lot 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.940
 more comfortable what we really are 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.150
 watching this and we did it for two things 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.130
 in particular there are two formats or two 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.360
 types of players there are seconds 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.940
 explaining according to the studies that have 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.730
 made one that is wheat only 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.650
 normal for what I mean the galloping of a 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.540
 animal that puts all the finger on the 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.580
 analogous and moves it having cracks and 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.400
 On the other hand, those who use the lateral 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.830
 then it is striated and has much more 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.560
 range of movement in that sense after 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:53.410
 not be more specific to later play 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.640
 a fps or whatever you want what 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.640
 interesting is that besides they have 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:03.540
 those in the end by citing the disc 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.540
 because normal for now if normal 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.500
 the normal violation has two 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:10.540
 vibrations in the wheat buttons is 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.520
 say that the days have for silva with 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.220
 which on this keyboard we were 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:18.480
 trying feels in the vibration of 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.260
 each one of each of the 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.060
 actions for example this case is 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.280
 firing a gun and I'm being 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.760
 a vibration only from the side only of 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:30.340
 right side as in a rhythm 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.960
 cardiac then good passes from the side 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.630
 left to the right side and now this 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.280
 it is an excellent excellent modifications 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.710
 about a product that does not have 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.410
 change it a lot programmer I think they have 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.760
 innovated as to how they present how 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.430
 videogames must be played 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.590
 in success also in the design 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.840
 industrial in this we see that it has a few 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.150
 screws and here are the holes of the 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.420
 screws and here and there it is then 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.459
 assembled nothing else is called chair 25 in 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.780
 the size and the battery so this good 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.810
 returning the battery is important 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.610
 use two batteries and almost last the same 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.130
 it is not saying so the same thing that lasts 

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.910
 the previous 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:11.180
 and good 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:13.340
 if the same apartment is rechargeable 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.130
 obviously lasted a little bit we have to 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:19.220
 activate the forums and the street but outside 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:22.360
 of that then is that the advances of 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.360
 next xbox world
