00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:06.089
 Welcome Christmas is coming 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.799
 and devil and she has something beautiful 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.500
 clever because headphones are always on 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.469
 big topic what you and others 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.330
 I can give a gift of love headphones circles 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.490
 in the wind, because you like the clocks 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.279
 nice and warm I have big ears 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.460
 and the orion will be fine too 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.470
 Surroundings are or your headphones 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.119
 cheap price of 100 euros it in 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.859
 There are also different colors to buy 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.730
 we have the white he get 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.579
 you can see a bit of one too 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.930
 Packaging white red and we will else 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.520
 look the same in detail as 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.440
 actually on the packaging itself 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.940
 you do not see much but you can 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.040
 Of course still a short one 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.790
 look in. I've had a go 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.340
 therefore no longer quite 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.320
 cleaned up as in the original but there 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.670
 we also see white and red 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.579
 accordingly and a bit of text 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.020
 if you want to read it because 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.510
 These are just extremely easy 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.940
 headphones and really perfect too 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.520
 take it with me and I just like 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.930
 I come in the best and again 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.030
 now runs the meantime what I said from 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.019
 So far Sophie has kept like 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.229
 I said it already a bit 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.820
 Tried and the sound was actually 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:11.460
 okay, i hear a lot 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.909
 bass-heavy sound has sounded good 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.659
 if you are a bit more alternative 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.710
 music sounds or simply more classical 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.869
 but I believe there and also another 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.189
 target group so here you can see the cool 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.229
 Packaging should never be seen 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.720
 by the way devil has here namely the 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.150
 headphones so to speak hover 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.920
 left here in the packaging before 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.520
 but still what we still get 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.250
 is a high quality bag here from the 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.850
 brand, of course, is the appropriate 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.530
 also on the inside and outside that is 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.630
 yes , I might be flowing now 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.250
 also call accordingly 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.909
 nice and soft and feels good on everyone 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.439
 good case 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.750
 There is also such a small package 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.060
 in there what then accordingly 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.189
 liquid raises we have here 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.719
 if I see it correctly with two cables 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.610
 However that I'll get you right yet 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.219
 at times because we have here a still 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.130
 manual with it so that we too with us 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.659
 With 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.479
 know what the headphones are then 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:10.750
 but in detail general not and 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:14.500
 information everything in English half way 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:17.170
 wild how to connect semester 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.569
 where on the left and on the right is the height 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.750
 we can adjust two lengths 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.610
 on the cable 13 meters and 3 meters the three 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.650
 meters of cable corresponding studios quite 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.200
 good because that has a 63 at the end 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.680
 millimeter connection means right here 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:36.819
 thick systems we have 44 mm three units 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:39.310
 2 100 milliwatt max input power so 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:43.000
 nice and loud they can be at 20 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:46.239
 to 20 20,000 hertz a corresponding 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.030
 from 20 to 20,000 have me sensibility 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:51.940
 of 102 plus / minus 4 decibels at one 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.489
 kilohertz and intendance of 50 euros plus 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.530
 minus ten percent also at one 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.269
 kilohertz exactly these are the details 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.769
 I think most people want to know how 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:05.440
 right now not outside and on it 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:07.299
 stood and otherwise good as I said 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.370
 two cables with it once three 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:11.319
 millimeter to three meters so for 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.480
 I really wanted a smartphone as well 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.670
 easy times out and that 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.500
 other, by the way, always has 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.200
 of course, gilds this right 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.609
 thick fat studio connection and the 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.600
 Rheinmetall concluded because he was able to 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.700
 his headphones off 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.319
 alright that we both have here then 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.540
 according to the same but to use 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.700
 how do I get here now? 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:33.220
 then I have the first time 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.750
 payments thought but actually gets 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.109
 Fortunately, this is relatively easy 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.799
 on 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:43.329
 and then you can here undergo the 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:46.299
 so after that settle war 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:48.970
 On the other hand, no 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:50.319
 well then I'm just the same 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.720
 then draw under it hang now 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:55.450
 just down with in there and there 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:59.319
 luckily i can just turn it off like that 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:03.670
 There is often another side too 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:05.230
 again equal hopefully in a way 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:09.220
 I have to do it once 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:11.890
 and then they are already freeing them 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.209
 do not just say the packaging but 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.069
 I am also doing this for me 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.350
 is currently watching a bit 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:21.400
 stupid one could say 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.449
 so devil has given much trouble and 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.900
 I believe the Chinese too 

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:28.350
 Pack it the easiest way 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.350
 from 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:35.020
 easy peasy we have another slide 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.729
 Of course I can do that 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.280
 which of course only to protect there because 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:41.350
 we have white plastic here 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.320
 I also like being dirty 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.639
 I was afraid that at first 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.889
 reflective white plastic is no 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:50.020
 That's pretty nice you can do 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:53.160
 still pull it off everywhere anyway 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:56.110
 it sounds terrible, so to speak 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:57.880
 so and then we already have one 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:05:00.699
 headphones still the devil logo here 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:04.389
 bit protected with really rouge in 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:05.860
 soft ears and now I look 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:08.500
 again right and left is the sees 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.330
 you just to mr and also in English 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.190
 then corresponding same right comes 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:15.460
 with me on the right side for you 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:17.139
 opposite are the left and ask 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.910
 let's go one size too 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:20.560
 very simply slips here 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.910
 and forth, and now you can already have 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.460
 make a picture of how exactly that looks 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:26.110
 my ears enclose my ears 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.090
 every case wonderful and I hear myself 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.930
 actually as good with and without that 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.400
 is very good if ever 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.849
 somebody talk to me 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.770
 would like to 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:34.840
 if the music is not as loud and 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:41.410
 now just simply times the cable and 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:43.060
 plug in the orion rio rio right 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:46.270
 pronounces a little German or 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:48.130
 English devil plast too by the way 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:51.460
 The wonderful end wants red and white 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:53.770
 by the way, black now has too 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:56.349
 I searched here ok bribe that now 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:59.770
 Of course, on the headphones down there 

00:05:56.349 --> 00:06:03.310
 a plug here simply the cable 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:06.820
 push in nice push on 

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:08.199
 Exactly and then we can already do it 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:11.010
 The rest of the rest is in here, too 

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:15.280
 wonderfully upholstered, nice and soft 

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:18.290
 yes, you can not say anything against it now 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:20.780
 and then we'll start my mobile phone 

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:26.840
 and not just listen to a bit of music 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:30.830
 start the app you make me i 'll do it 

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:32.030
 maybe it could be over that 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.410
 Microphone also a bit with and 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.810
 I'm not sure anymore 

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:37.250
 I can speak very much when I speak 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.500
 say good sign when it says 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:41.420
 chatter is quite okay that's very 

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:44.320
 bass heavy sled but I go now 

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.320
 to the next 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:57.350
 So that's already very good 

00:06:55.820 --> 00:07:03.560
 while her husband sings that now 

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:05.170
 discovered to you very balanced atom 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:07.190
 I want to say in any case now 

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:09.560
 So I understand a studio anyway 

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:11.360
 cable is still to be added for the 

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:14.870
 Price also really cheap for 

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:16.490
 studio headphone bit of a shame is 

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:18.200
 of course that there is no cable with it 

00:07:16.490 --> 00:07:19.820
 where are I here now 

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.170
 volume or so could regulate for 

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:25.820
 There are most of those with iphone 

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:27.970
 but she definitely hears well 

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.970
 on 

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:33.560
 the bassist is still a bit 

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:35.570
 could possibly tinny but I 

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:37.220
 I think I'm a little spoiled by 2 

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:39.200
 300 400 euro headphones of course this 

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:40.940
 also from the devil are in the 100 euro 

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.140
 price range in any case a 

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:45.950
 very good choice 

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:47.360
 compact already fast as stable 

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:49.160
 So we can definitely do it 

00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:51.560
 could look nice turning into each one here 

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:53.900
 Direction do not break and yes 

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:57.650
 every case as upper ear headphones for 

00:07:53.900 --> 00:08:00.650
 a chicken like that were the devil real 

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:02.570
 Orior wants to see you next time 

00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:04.150
 name has watched alaska fans and 

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:06.290
 do not forget to subscribe to the channels 

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:07.520
 and maybe the headphones 

00:08:06.290 --> 00:08:10.120
 a black watch in the 

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:10.120
 online shop
