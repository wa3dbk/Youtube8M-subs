a<00:00:19.560> half<00:00:19.710> inch<00:00:19.949> brush<00:00:20.189> I<00:00:20.550> want<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.510> take<00:00:21.600> just<00:00:21.810> a

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
a half inch brush I want to take just a

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.480 
a half inch brush I want to take just a
little<00:00:21.930> bit<00:00:22.199> of<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.410> color<00:00:22.619> on<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:22.920> brush<00:00:23.039> and

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
little bit of the color on the brush and

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.880 
little bit of the color on the brush and
really<00:00:24.480> work<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.140> paint<00:00:25.380> into<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.680> bristles

working<00:00:26.460> into<00:00:26.609> the<00:00:26.699> bristles<00:00:26.910> so<00:00:27.119> you<00:00:27.210> have<00:00:27.359> a

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
working into the bristles so you have a

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.150 
working into the bristles so you have a
nice<00:00:27.660> even<00:00:27.869> distribution<00:00:28.080> of<00:00:28.619> color<00:00:28.890> and

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
and I'm gonna start right at the top of

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.940 
and I'm gonna start right at the top of
the<00:00:32.969> canvas<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:33.570> make<00:00:33.600> little<00:00:34.440> crisscross

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
the canvas and make little crisscross

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.940 
the canvas and make little crisscross
strokes<00:00:35.340> little<00:00:35.790> X's<00:00:36.380> now<00:00:37.380> if<00:00:37.500> your<00:00:37.620> color<00:00:37.860> is

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
not right when you get to this point

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.810 
not right when you get to this point
stop<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.379> correct<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.890> okay<00:00:41.870> now<00:00:43.610> it's<00:00:44.610> easy

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
stop and correct it okay now it's easy

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.850 
stop and correct it okay now it's easy
to<00:00:44.940> make<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.180> sky<00:00:45.450> darker<00:00:45.960> but<00:00:46.410> it's<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.620> Sun

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
to make a sky darker but it's the Sun

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.979 
to make a sky darker but it's the Sun
are<00:00:46.950> we<00:00:47.010> going<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.280> make<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:47.520> lighter<00:00:47.840> so<00:00:48.840> use

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
are we going to make it lighter so use

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.540 
are we going to make it lighter so use
very<00:00:49.289> little<00:00:49.410> paint<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:49.890> can<00:00:50.039> always<00:00:50.219> add

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
very little paint you can always add

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.930 
very little paint you can always add
more<00:00:50.989> go<00:00:51.989> all<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.230> way<00:00:52.260> across<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.739> top<00:00:52.940> use

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
more go all the way across the top use

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.170 
more go all the way across the top use
our<00:00:54.120> little<00:00:54.270> crisscross<00:00:54.930> strokes<00:00:55.670> and<00:00:56.670> begin

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
our little crisscross strokes and begin

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.080 
our little crisscross strokes and begin
blending<00:00:57.570> downward<00:00:57.989> now<00:00:58.730> your<00:00:59.730> color<00:00:59.940> is

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
blending downward now your color is

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.430 
blending downward now your color is
mixing<00:01:00.420> with<00:01:00.449> a<00:01:00.600> magic<00:01:01.020> white<00:01:01.230> and

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
mixing with a magic white and

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.319 
mixing with a magic white and
automatically<00:01:02.309> gets<00:01:02.579> lighter<00:01:02.850> as<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:03.149> goes

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
automatically gets lighter as it goes

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.910 
automatically gets lighter as it goes
toward<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.660> horizon<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.409> that's<00:01:04.650> what<00:01:04.769> we're

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
toward the horizon and that's what we're

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.539 
toward the horizon and that's what we're
looking<00:01:05.189> for<00:01:05.780> at<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.900> landscape<00:01:07.439> things<00:01:08.280> should

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
looking for at a landscape things should

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.460 
looking for at a landscape things should
get<00:01:08.700> darker<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.479> value<00:01:09.840> as<00:01:09.930> they<00:01:10.049> get<00:01:10.170> closer

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
get darker and value as they get closer

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.179 
get darker and value as they get closer
to<00:01:10.799> you<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.189> will<00:01:12.090> take<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.299> little<00:01:12.479> more<00:01:12.570> color

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
to you you will take a little more color

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:16.160 
to you you will take a little more color
let's<00:01:14.189> go<00:01:14.340> right<00:01:14.580> up<00:01:14.729> here<00:01:15.060> still<00:01:15.659> making<00:01:16.110> a

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
let's go right up here still making a

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.710 
let's go right up here still making a
little<00:01:16.290> crisscross<00:01:16.799> strokes<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.720> blend

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
little crisscross strokes and blend

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.039 
little crisscross strokes and blend
downward<00:01:20.270> so<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.450> gets<00:01:21.600> much<00:01:21.840> much

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
downward so that it gets much much

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:28.790 
downward so that it gets much much
lighter<00:01:22.380> right<00:01:22.619> here<00:01:22.830> at<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:22.979> horizon<00:01:24.920> okay

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.330 

there<00:01:29.800> we<00:01:30.040> go<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:32.110> very<00:01:32.410> gently<00:01:32.740> we'll<00:01:33.160> just

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
there we go and very gently we'll just

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.020 
there we go and very gently we'll just
blend<00:01:33.550> that<00:01:33.730> out<00:01:35.430> now<00:01:36.430> well<00:01:36.610> I've<00:01:36.730> got<00:01:36.910> the

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
blend that out now well I've got the

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:38.340 
blend that out now well I've got the
color<00:01:37.180> on<00:01:37.390> the<00:01:37.480> brush<00:01:37.630> I'm<00:01:37.930> going<00:01:38.110> to<00:01:38.170> load<00:01:38.320> a

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
color on the brush I'm going to load a

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.560 
color on the brush I'm going to load a
little<00:01:38.530> bit<00:01:38.740> more<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:40.090> we'll<00:01:40.240> have<00:01:40.270> some

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
little bit more and we'll have some

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.770 
little bit more and we'll have some
water<00:01:40.810> down<00:01:41.050> here<00:01:41.290> at<00:01:41.350> the<00:01:41.440> bottom<00:01:41.740> and<00:01:42.780> one

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
water down here at the bottom and one

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.660 
water down here at the bottom and one
thing<00:01:43.960> about<00:01:44.170> water<00:01:44.440> if<00:01:44.980> it's<00:01:45.220> still<00:01:45.460> water

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
thing about water if it's still water

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.030 
thing about water if it's still water
it's<00:01:45.910> always<00:01:46.090> flat<00:01:46.560> so<00:01:47.560> pull<00:01:47.800> from<00:01:47.980> the

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
it's always flat so pull from the

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:53.760 
it's always flat so pull from the
outside<00:01:48.520> in<00:01:50.010> outside<00:01:51.010> in<00:01:51.480> and<00:01:52.560> keep<00:01:53.560> these

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
outside in outside in and keep these

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.410 
outside in outside in and keep these
strokes<00:01:54.070> as<00:01:54.280> straight<00:01:54.520> as<00:01:54.640> possible<00:01:54.700> but<00:01:55.330> it

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
strokes as straight as possible but it

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.470 
strokes as straight as possible but it
