00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hi it's me that the author proposes a 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.529
 small unpacking video gives boxing 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.970
 in English from the circle mobileye this 500 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.410
 with my very good english accent in this 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.710
 he is doing in France the acer cloud of 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.519
 mobile s 500 it's a moment that 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.440
 I had the opportunity to introduce you 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.900
 especially during a preview video 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.490
 I'm going to shoot on the mwc show 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.320
 2013 so the mwcc the mobile world 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.410
 2013 congress held in barcelona 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.939
 in February 2013 so 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.900
 so I showed you this phone to 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.099
 the occasion of August 10 preview 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.910
 today is the unpacking video 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.260
 which inevitably leads you to tell you that 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.649
 the videotest will be coming soon and that's 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.110
 well the case 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.190
 we are on the unpacking video and the 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.219
 video test will arrive within a few days 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.510
 maximum ten days so here 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.680
 video unpacking opening the box in it 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.789
 even we can see the contents of the box 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.620
 knowing that it is a path that is not 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.430
 new but it is not very serious it does 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.530
 no problem at 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.910
 precisely from the examination of the box 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.770
 mobile keyyo at first and from 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.090
 the box and the mode besides knowing 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.460
 it was missing that it was an accessory 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.210
 on the other hand, the pedestrian kit is missing 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.340
 actually he is no longer in the 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.870
 box and yes the previous tester had to 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.340
 forget about their master anyway 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.750
 in either we will already do a little tour 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.949
 of the box and we will tell ourselves what he 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.170
 is so it's a box that is 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.640
 absolutely not a classic among 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.010
 builders so it's really a 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.900
 format apart from the dimensions are 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.299
 specific aesthetics is specific 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.590
 and so it's not necessary to pump and especially 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.540
 it's not the fishing bridge to greenhouse the 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.040
 hands since builder and well it's 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.780
 well a box apart it's not a 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.430
 box that used on all all 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.570
 models which also symbolizes a 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.009
 little bit that on the mobile was a 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.479
 little bit in mode that is extracted from the rest 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.920
 others is a bit high-end 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.570
 finally at acer this is a bit of 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.250
 top of the top maybe it's not the top 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.170
 range on the market but it's a 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.020
 very good bad at acer and that's who 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.220
 clearly in the top of the basket 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.930
 so here's a box on which on the 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.759
 ambient front side notice the mobile in 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.070
 himself front side of the mobile cloud 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.399
 mobile so it's the station is an acer 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.790
 cloud moba ml500 these numbers this is the 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.090
 reference 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:54.060
 in any case it is the version so to his 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.979
 exports bern the acer media so 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.850
 explore beyond limits go 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.979
 beyond the limits 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.990
 this is the famous the famous slogan a 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.829
 small logo with a cloud going because 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.420
 of a little cloud because actually 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.610
 acer prides itself on a number 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.469
 integrated cloud functionality in 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.710
 the smartphones below the box 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.750
 we notice a number of logo 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.340
 android ice cream logo sandwich so 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.260
 of the android version that is asked about 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.930
 this phone that the phone is endowed 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.640
 of a dolby sound he was at scales by 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.950
 the door is talking him about the micro usb port that 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.170
 so a mhl port actually that it is endowed 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.720
 a processor with 5 gig dual hertz 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.580
 heart 1 gig of ram 8 gig of memory of 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.520
 storage function webcam location 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.950
 micro sim a screen 4 3 inches a 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.600
 8 megapixel camera and it 's 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.130
 complained of specifications to the box so 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.260
 we realize that this is a 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.640
 quadbands who the stranger more than he 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.550
 has a qualcomm processor that I 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:46.090
 you are talking about 720 resolution resolution 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:48.760
 so this is a hd he has a 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:52.090
 camera with led flash and that he has 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.880
 a gps with wifi bluetooth bgn ags 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:58.450
 4.0 and who the deliberation that are 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.810
 these namely 2.5 cm long 6.6 cm 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.610
 wide 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.550
 I round and almost 1 cm thick 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.690
 almost meaning that it takes 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.160
 millimeters thick ie 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.080
 just enough to say he does 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.120
 not a dime so when I open the 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.770
 box what I want to do I you 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.720
 then shows that on a cradle in 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.700
 cardboard is positioned the phone 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.930
 the phone has a beautiful aesthetic 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.010
 I you had already returned the occasion 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.360
 of david on the occasion of the videos of 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.880
 previous a phone that presents well 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.230
 that a good grip so beautiful 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.670
 aesthetic good grip and 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.230
 especially that there is a plastic back 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.340
 slightly textured rubbery and which 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.080
 just avoid the phone from 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.760
 slides and brings a real pleasure 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.780
 of use on and here we are on 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.590
 something very soft to the touch 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.500
 very pleasant 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.150
 so firstly first point in the 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.230
 phone contact is good it's already 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.390
 a very good grade 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.860
 the phone was positioned so summer 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.840
 placed as I wanted to evoke on a 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.890
 cardboard aquarius so I take it off 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.360
 cradle what do I find you at 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.310
 inside the band so I 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.760
 find dope the valves oc want 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.070
 you are here 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.660
 actually quite rare and not stingy in 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.860
 paper so there you want no problem 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.030
 so I have teenagers who lets you know 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.260
 how do i get out of the battery how 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.740
 hunt to a sim card and his lands and 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.810
 what else do I have 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:04.240
 others I have a little air wrongly I 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.850
 a warranty booklet a little thick 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.260
 by the way he says 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:12.660
 how to use my warranty which 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:13.380
 contact etc i also have to saint 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.540
 cloud at home 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.180
 so how to configure the cloud to 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.830
 to do on this mobile here is actually 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.660
 as I mentioned alster 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:23.610
 prides itself on having put in place a 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.030
 cloud that better than not look too much 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.340
 badly marketed 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.810
 we have the mobile cloud s 500 places and 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.800
 the other user guide these manuals 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.450
 mobile usage 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.770
 good well it's not necessarily a 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.000
 bad idea because or so we are 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.260
 on an android phone there are people 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.030
 who do not know in time since this is 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.920
 their first android to use a 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.180
 smartphone type phone android and 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.870
 so yes you may have 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.720
 orientation 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.640
 yes there is and yes you have fun 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.050
 to read that I imagine of course 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.300
 like any user who buys a 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.500
 well electronic in general it's the 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.900
 first thing he does is well 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.770
 manual then we know something else in 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.060
 the box what we do not care 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.640
 found an AC adapter that is 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.800
 in two parts 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:01.010
 connectivity is here that allows 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:03.900
 to link with another policy that of 

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:05.490
 precisely during the AC adapter 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.140
 French to send a judge and a 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.070
 classical connectivity maybe format 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.510
 uk by the way I almost feel 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.600
 that it's an English format have judged these 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.800
 patterns on which I positioned a 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.860
 adapter that will allow me precisely 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.100
 to have a format and so format 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.940
 France so that's the good hue 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.640
 something that I also find 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:26.010
 and well the usb usb micro USB cable 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:28.140
 knowing that the port is a mhl port and 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.980
 not just microusb and as I 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.180
 wanted to actually evoke their 

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.950
 mix of your assets that kills your but 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.320
 here is the tester that was for sale at 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:36.540
 forgot to put shame on him 

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.830
 as for him and I was watching in the evening I 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:40.050
 would say what it is and I would say 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.070
 he forgot about the rest 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.090
 what I 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.500
 you evokes so is that inside 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.270
 of this box we have an adapter 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.410
 sector in two parts here by 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.050
 which we find the possibility 

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:54.360
 plug a kit a usb micro usb cable 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:55.560
 here the usd bingo entry for my part me 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.260
 I will break AC adapter to 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:06:00.240
