00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.270 
bottom enough time to get this up at
home<00:02:13.260> I<00:02:13.560> did<00:02:14.219> not<00:02:14.310> expect<00:02:14.430> that<00:02:14.819> I<00:02:15.299> was<00:02:15.569> I<00:02:16.280> was

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
home I did not expect that I was I was

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.339 
home I did not expect that I was I was
weary<00:02:17.489> journey<00:02:17.879> man<00:02:18.180> even<00:02:19.170> though<00:02:19.200> the

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
weary journey man even though the

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.789 
weary journey man even though the
standard<00:02:19.859> macro<00:02:20.430> game<00:02:20.670> circus<00:02:21.299> has<00:02:21.930> their<00:02:22.769> own

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
standard macro game circus has their own

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:26.059 
standard macro game circus has their own
advantage<00:02:23.219> in<00:02:23.609> this<00:02:23.730> matchup<00:02:24.000> and<00:02:24.359> I<00:02:25.079> think<00:02:25.980> it

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
advantage in this matchup and I think it

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.949 
advantage in this matchup and I think it
would<00:02:26.189> cross<00:02:26.760> buns<00:02:27.060> though<00:02:27.299> I<00:02:27.329> mean<00:02:27.540> it's<00:02:27.689> oh

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
would cross buns though I mean it's oh

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.140 
would cross buns though I mean it's oh
yeah<00:02:28.290> first<00:02:28.560> look<00:02:28.739> yeah<00:02:29.010> Trixie<00:02:29.819> across<00:02:30.030> the

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
yeah first look yeah Trixie across the

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.780 
yeah first look yeah Trixie across the
screen<00:02:30.269> like<00:02:30.780> in<00:02:30.930> cross<00:02:31.170> buns<00:02:31.560> I<00:02:32.010> don't<00:02:32.670> know

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
screen like in cross buns I don't know

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.459 
screen like in cross buns I don't know
man<00:02:32.969> here's<00:02:33.480> a<00:02:33.540> lot<00:02:33.780> of<00:02:33.870> open<00:02:34.049> engagement

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:34.469 
man here's a lot of open engagement

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:36.110 
man here's a lot of open engagement
areas<00:02:34.680> so<00:02:34.799> yeah<00:02:34.980> I<00:02:35.219> guess<00:02:35.400> is<00:02:35.609> there<00:02:35.790> like<00:02:36.090> a

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
areas so yeah I guess is there like a

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.910 
areas so yeah I guess is there like a
little<00:02:36.450> bit<00:02:36.540> of<00:02:36.569> an<00:02:36.689> engagement<00:02:36.900> edge<00:02:37.409> but<00:02:37.709> I

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
little bit of an engagement edge but I

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.039 
little bit of an engagement edge but I
think<00:02:38.549> if<00:02:38.700> this<00:02:38.819> a<00:02:38.849> god<00:02:39.090> like<00:02:39.299> an<00:02:39.389> actual<00:02:39.659> macro

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
think if this a god like an actual macro

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:41.240 
think if this a god like an actual macro
