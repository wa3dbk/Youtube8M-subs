00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
trackpad very similar to what you have

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:42.440 
trackpad very similar to what you have
on<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.640> macbook<00:00:41.820> you're<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.210> little<00:00:42.360> bit

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
on the macbook you're a little bit

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.819

bigger<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:42.989> can<00:00:43.110> use<00:00:43.200> this<00:00:43.350> with<00:00:43.739> your

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
bigger and you can use this with your

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
something over on the side so here we

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.529 
something over on the side so here we
are<00:00:50.219> looking<00:00:50.489> at<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.090> trackpad

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
are looking at the the trackpad

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.119 
are looking at the the trackpad
preferences<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.590> can<00:00:52.710> have<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.829> bunch<00:00:53.070> of

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
preferences and you can have a bunch of

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:53.900 
preferences and you can have a bunch of
them<00:00:53.309> i'll<00:00:53.430> just<00:00:53.550> kind<00:00:53.670> of<00:00:53.699> walk<00:00:53.879> through

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
them i'll just kind of walk through

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.279 
them i'll just kind of walk through
these<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.300> little<00:00:54.480> bit<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:54.899> then<00:00:55.050> i'll<00:00:55.140> give

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
these a little bit and then i'll give

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.630 
these a little bit and then i'll give
you<00:00:55.379> some<00:00:55.559> ideas<00:00:56.010> on<00:00:56.039> how<00:00:56.340> they<00:00:56.520> all<00:00:56.610> work

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
you some ideas on how they all work

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.860 
you some ideas on how they all work
alright<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:57.360> here<00:00:57.510> we<00:00:57.600> are<00:00:57.690> in<00:00:57.840> the

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
alright so here we are in the

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.630 
alright so here we are in the
preferences<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.800> i<00:00:58.890> think<00:00:59.129> overall<00:00:59.550> you

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
preferences and i think overall you

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.279 
preferences and i think overall you
apples<00:01:00.149> make<00:01:00.300> an<00:01:00.449> effort<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:01.020> have<00:01:01.260> a

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
apples make an effort to have a

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.860 
apples make an effort to have a
convergence<00:01:01.949> with<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.340> iOS<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.329> mac<00:01:03.510> OS

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
convergence with the iOS and the mac OS

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.630 
convergence with the iOS and the mac OS
in<00:01:04.049> terms<00:01:04.260> of<00:01:04.379> some<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.680> user<00:01:04.890> interface<00:01:05.129> I

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
in terms of some of the user interface I

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.770 
in terms of some of the user interface I
think<00:01:05.970> that's<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.150> pretty<00:01:06.270> good<00:01:06.420> thing<00:01:06.630> you

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
think that's a pretty good thing you

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:07.850 
think that's a pretty good thing you
know<00:01:06.869> this<00:01:07.020> will<00:01:07.170> make<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.500> little<00:01:07.710> bit

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
know this will make it a little bit

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.130 
know this will make it a little bit
easier<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.310> go<00:01:08.520> between<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:09.060> devices<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.810> know

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
easier to go between the devices I know

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.750 
easier to go between the devices I know
some<00:01:10.320> people<00:01:10.350> have<00:01:10.650> some<00:01:10.799> anxiety<00:01:10.950> about<00:01:11.340> you

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
some people have some anxiety about you

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.820 
some people have some anxiety about you
know<00:01:11.820> Apple<00:01:12.150> dumbing<00:01:12.479> down<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.930> mac<00:01:13.170> for<00:01:13.680> the

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
know Apple dumbing down the mac for the

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.330 
know Apple dumbing down the mac for the
iOS<00:01:14.189> but<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.270> think<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.600> lot<00:01:15.630> of<00:01:15.780> these<00:01:15.900> user

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
iOS but I think a lot of these user

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.289 
iOS but I think a lot of these user
interfaces<00:01:17.340> really<00:01:17.610> kind<00:01:17.820> of<00:01:17.909> blend<00:01:18.150> together

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
interfaces really kind of blend together

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.730 
interfaces really kind of blend together
and<00:01:18.689> work<00:01:18.840> well<00:01:19.020> I<00:01:19.080> think<00:01:19.290> they're<00:01:19.530> pretty

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
and work well I think they're pretty

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.530 
and work well I think they're pretty
intuitive<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.640> with<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.939> touch<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.420> know

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
intuitive and with the touch you know

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.539 
intuitive and with the touch you know
pad<00:01:21.810> devices<00:01:22.650> that<00:01:22.830> we<00:01:22.979> can<00:01:23.130> have<00:01:23.250> her<00:01:23.369> input

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
pad devices that we can have her input

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.710 
still haven't gotten in right okay there
you<00:02:50.370> go<00:02:50.430> so<00:02:50.640> basically<00:02:50.970> it<00:02:51.030> to<00:02:51.120> click<00:02:51.360> and<00:02:51.540> hold

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
you go so basically it to click and hold

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.270 
you go so basically it to click and hold
to<00:02:51.930> get<00:02:52.170> it<00:02:52.260> to<00:02:52.319> go<00:02:52.470> or<00:02:52.650> before<00:02:52.980> you<00:02:53.160> know<00:02:53.220> I

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
to get it to go or before you know I

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.559 
to get it to go or before you know I
always<00:02:53.430> like<00:02:53.640> to<00:02:53.670> click<00:02:53.940> down<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.239> bottom<00:02:54.480> so

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
always like to click down the bottom so

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.600 
always like to click down the bottom so
I'm<00:02:54.630> not<00:02:54.780> really<00:02:54.959> crazy<00:02:55.200> about<00:02:55.500> this<00:02:56.370> whole

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
I'm not really crazy about this whole

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.660 
I'm not really crazy about this whole
user<00:02:57.239> interface<00:02:58.049> so<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:58.799> new<00:02:58.950> scrolling

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
user interface so the new scrolling

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.670 
user interface so the new scrolling
before<00:03:00.390> it<00:03:00.690> worked<00:03:00.959> just<00:03:01.049> like<00:03:01.230> it<00:03:01.440> did<00:03:01.560> with

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
before it worked just like it did with

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.160 
before it worked just like it did with
the<00:03:01.830> scrolling<00:03:02.220> Mouse<00:03:02.459> where<00:03:03.269> you<00:03:03.870> know<00:03:03.959> if

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
the scrolling Mouse where you know if

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.259 
the scrolling Mouse where you know if
you<00:03:04.260> move<00:03:04.500> down<00:03:04.530> it<00:03:05.160> would<00:03:05.430> move<00:03:05.880> the<00:03:06.060> screen

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
you move down it would move the screen

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:07.699 
you move down it would move the screen
down<00:03:06.420> if<00:03:06.600> you<00:03:06.690> moved<00:03:06.870> it<00:03:06.989> up<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.319> screen<00:03:07.590> and

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
down if you moved it up the screen and

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.140 
down if you moved it up the screen and
move<00:03:07.860> up<00:03:08.010> now<00:03:08.190> it's<00:03:08.489> different<00:03:08.640> it's<00:03:08.910> actually

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
move up now it's different it's actually

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.259 
move up now it's different it's actually
a<00:03:09.180> little<00:03:09.269> more<00:03:09.420> similar<00:03:09.870> to<00:03:10.080> the<00:03:10.650> iOS<00:03:11.280> where<00:03:11.819> I

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
a little more similar to the iOS where I

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.449 
a little more similar to the iOS where I
you<00:03:13.049> know<00:03:13.140> basically<00:03:13.380> cursors<00:03:13.860> sort<00:03:14.160> of<00:03:14.280> your

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
you know basically cursors sort of your

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.509 
you know basically cursors sort of your
your<00:03:15.030> finger<00:03:15.900> you<00:03:16.080> know<00:03:16.200> and<00:03:16.440> if<00:03:17.040> you<00:03:17.160> want<00:03:17.430> the

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
your finger you know and if you want the

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.370 
your finger you know and if you want the
screen<00:03:18.000> to<00:03:18.329> if<00:03:18.450> you<00:03:18.510> want<00:03:18.660> to<00:03:18.720> push<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:18.900> screen

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
screen to if you want to push the screen

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.729 
screen to if you want to push the screen
up<00:03:19.560> you<00:03:19.980> know<00:03:20.130> you<00:03:20.900> you<00:03:21.900> push<00:03:22.200> down<00:03:22.230> you<00:03:22.500> know

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
up you know you you push down you know

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:23.930 
up you know you you push down you know
so<00:03:22.859> it's<00:03:22.980> a<00:03:23.010> little<00:03:23.190> more<00:03:23.430> like<00:03:23.579> a<00:03:23.609> behavior

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
so it's a little more like a behavior

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.930 
so it's a little more like a behavior
using<00:03:24.090> your<00:03:24.359> hand<00:03:24.660> and<00:03:24.870> necessarily

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
using your hand and necessarily

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:27.979 
using your hand and necessarily
manipulating<00:03:26.940> a<00:03:27.030> cursor<00:03:27.420> I<00:03:27.450> guess<00:03:27.750> so<00:03:27.870> that

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
manipulating a cursor I guess so that

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.090 
manipulating a cursor I guess so that
makes<00:03:28.200> some<00:03:28.320> sense<00:03:28.380> it's<00:03:28.739> going<00:03:28.920> to<00:03:28.980> take<00:03:29.070> a

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
makes some sense it's going to take a

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.650 
makes some sense it's going to take a
little<00:03:29.220> bit<00:03:29.400> getting<00:03:29.579> used<00:03:29.670> to<00:03:29.940> but<00:03:30.420> one

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
little bit getting used to but one

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.300 
little bit getting used to but one
interesting<00:03:31.320> little<00:03:31.500> change<00:03:31.829> here<00:03:31.950> that<00:03:32.220> they

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
interesting little change here that they

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.810 
interesting little change here that they
put<00:03:32.549> in<00:03:33.230> moving<00:03:34.230> along<00:03:34.440> a<00:03:34.500> smart<00:03:35.010> zoom<00:03:35.220> this<00:03:35.640> is

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
put in moving along a smart zoom this is

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.880 
put in moving along a smart zoom this is
again<00:03:36.150> a<00:03:36.180> very<00:03:36.480> similar<00:03:36.810> to<00:03:36.870> the<00:03:37.049> iOS<00:03:37.650> feature

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
again a very similar to the iOS feature

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.650 
again a very similar to the iOS feature
if<00:03:38.100> you<00:03:38.190> want<00:03:38.370> to<00:03:38.459> zoom<00:03:38.640> into<00:03:38.850> this<00:03:39.090> just

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
if you want to zoom into this just

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.449 
if you want to zoom into this just
double-click<00:03:39.959> it<00:03:40.230> and<00:03:40.320> it'll<00:03:40.709> zoom<00:03:40.950> into<00:03:41.160> that

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
double-click it and it'll zoom into that

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.250 
double-click it and it'll zoom into that
area<00:03:41.790> you<00:03:42.180> know<00:03:42.269> right<00:03:42.480> around<00:03:42.600> the<00:03:42.989> mouse<00:03:43.230> and

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
area you know right around the mouse and

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.920 
area you know right around the mouse and
it's<00:03:43.980> smart<00:03:44.370> because<00:03:44.730> it'll<00:03:45.030> will<00:03:45.209> you<00:03:45.840> know

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
it's smart because it'll will you know

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.500 
it's smart because it'll will you know
basically<00:03:46.079> come<00:03:46.920> around<00:03:47.190> the<00:03:47.489> the<00:03:47.910> word<00:03:48.150> or

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
basically come around the the word or

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.120 
basically come around the the word or
the<00:03:48.540> section<00:03:48.989> that<00:03:49.109> you<00:03:49.260> want<00:03:49.590> to<00:03:49.650> look<00:03:49.829> at<00:03:49.980> it

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
the section that you want to look at it

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.220 
the section that you want to look at it
seems<00:03:50.400> intelligent<00:03:51.060> to<00:03:51.329> do<00:03:51.480> so<00:03:51.660> now<00:03:51.989> rotate

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
seems intelligent to do so now rotate

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.380 
seems intelligent to do so now rotate
this<00:03:52.859> is<00:03:52.980> a<00:03:53.040> way<00:03:53.130> to<00:03:53.190> manipulate<00:03:53.340> photos<00:03:54.150> and

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
this is a way to manipulate photos and

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.349 
this is a way to manipulate photos and
whatnot<00:03:54.720> if<00:03:54.959> you<00:03:55.109> have<00:03:55.380> a<00:03:56.120> you<00:03:57.120> know<00:03:57.180> like<00:03:57.239> a

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:57.359 
whatnot if you have a you know like a

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:58.550 
whatnot if you have a you know like a
graphics<00:03:57.720> program<00:03:57.870> or<00:03:58.200> something<00:03:58.440> if<00:03:58.500> you're

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
graphics program or something if you're

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.800 
graphics program or something if you're
missing<00:03:58.709> all<00:03:58.920> the<00:03:58.980> iPhoto<00:03:59.400> or<00:03:59.700> or<00:03:59.880> you<00:03:59.910> know

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
missing all the iPhoto or or you know

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.270 
missing all the iPhoto or or you know
like<00:04:01.260> pages<00:04:01.680> or<00:04:01.799> anything<00:04:02.010> like<00:04:02.040> that<00:04:02.160> you

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
like pages or anything like that you

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.830 
like pages or anything like that you
work<00:04:02.519> with<00:04:02.549> graphics<00:04:03.120> just<00:04:03.239> the<00:04:03.329> way<00:04:03.420> to<00:04:03.450> do<00:04:03.660> it

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
work with graphics just the way to do it

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.380 
work with graphics just the way to do it
right<00:04:04.260> inside<00:04:04.500> there<00:04:04.980> even<00:04:05.819> more<00:04:05.850> gestures

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
right inside there even more gestures

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.330 
right inside there even more gestures
here<00:04:06.569> we<00:04:06.900> could<00:04:07.019> swipe<00:04:07.200> between<00:04:07.350> pages<00:04:08.100> so

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
here we could swipe between pages so

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:13.069 
here we could swipe between pages so
let's<00:04:08.609> say<00:04:08.790> we<00:04:08.970> have<00:04:09.350> we<00:04:10.350> have<00:04:10.530> the<00:04:11.930> got<00:04:12.930> this

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
let's say we have we have the got this

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.410 
let's say we have we have the got this
right<00:04:13.290> here<00:04:13.739> if<00:04:14.220> I<00:04:14.310> want<00:04:14.489> to<00:04:14.549> go<00:04:14.639> between<00:04:14.790> I<00:04:15.239> can

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
right here if I want to go between I can

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.949 
right here if I want to go between I can
just<00:04:15.630> easily<00:04:16.190> go<00:04:17.190> let's<00:04:17.669> stay<00:04:17.880> here<00:04:18.180> right

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
was actually the previous version but it

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.240 
was actually the previous version but it
looks<00:04:24.960> a<00:04:25.110> little<00:04:25.260> bit<00:04:25.440> more<00:04:25.560> refined<00:04:25.710> right

swipe between full screen apps so if to

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.050 
swipe between full screen apps so if to
do<00:04:31.229> this<00:04:31.500> you<00:04:31.710> can<00:04:31.830> do<00:04:31.919> four<00:04:32.160> fingers<00:04:32.550> right<00:04:32.789> or
