00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
so cool it's really viscous it almost

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.510 
so cool it's really viscous it almost
looks<00:01:19.070> like<00:01:20.110> blown<00:01:21.110> glass<00:01:21.440> or<00:01:21.980> something<00:01:22.250> then

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
looks like blown glass or something then

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.490

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
I take the other chopstick and then you

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.500 
I take the other chopstick and then you
just<00:01:24.770> start<00:01:26.650> stretching<00:01:27.650> it<00:01:28.100> and<00:01:28.330> whipping<00:01:29.330> it

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510 
just start stretching it and whipping it

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:36.250 
just start stretching it and whipping it
okay<00:01:30.760> I'm<00:01:31.760> just<00:01:32.350> playing<00:01:33.350> with<00:01:33.530> it<00:01:33.910> and<00:01:35.260> then

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260 
okay I'm just playing with it and then

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:44.350 
okay I'm just playing with it and then
as<00:01:36.380> it<00:01:36.560> gets<00:01:36.650> thicker<00:01:37.390> when<00:01:38.390> you<00:01:38.510> eat<00:01:38.660> it<00:01:43.300> so<00:01:44.300> I

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
as it gets thicker when you eat it so I

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.550 
as it gets thicker when you eat it so I
think<00:01:44.450> this<00:01:44.690> is<00:01:44.750> more<00:01:45.080> for<00:01:45.410> like

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
think this is more for like

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.410 
think this is more for like
entertainment<00:01:46.400> or<00:01:46.550> something<00:01:46.940> I<00:01:47.150> don't<00:01:47.210> know

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
entertainment or something I don't know
