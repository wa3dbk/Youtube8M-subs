00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:08.640
 I know the mobile p that I am currently using at the main thinkpad edge p 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.420
 It's 130 but this is it 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:17.490
 I do not know why the upgrade of windows 10 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:19.470
 Basic window the battery and windows 7 free upgrade 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.890
 It should be possible 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.810
 However so unconditionally 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:30.820
 By the corresponding situation of the without drivers and firmware application is not 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:32.290
 I think that I might get stuck with this if I might not be able to blade 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.910
 Though 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:40.880
 What is such because it is clear at least the minimum system requirements 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:47.390
 By it means that I it was a little strange and I wonder dont 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:50.060
 I tried searching over Nobo, but the details of the product to upgrade are listed e 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:53.090
 How is 130? 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:57.920
 It is such a thing 7 is 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:01:00.870
 And you can once upgrade there and I can not be upgraded to the store 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.940
 Unfortunately at my e 130 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.020
 You're 7 huh What 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.380
 I got stuck here and I haven't been notified of the upgrade . 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:16.039
 I'm sad 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:18.049
 Anyway , if you look at this limitation, you will find that it is quite limited. 

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:26.119
 There is not each in a messy influence 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:29.400
 Models equipped with 4th and 5th generation Intel strong are 32 bit os configuration 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.909
 It is no good and is it serious? 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:36.299
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:38.590
 Because this generation personal computer is so active, just because it is simply bit os 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:44.229
 I can't hold Winz 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:49.210
 It's tough, you ca n't use it entirely, but it's also tough 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:50.469
 photo It is a model failure equipped with an authentic fingerprint reader 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:57.340
 Is this what you are saying 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:58.610
 Others also have put the controller of various There you Ne particular wi-fi Toda 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.640
 Honor or 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:05.310
 ambient light sensor 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.260
 It is no good if you enter the multi-card reader of Nikko 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.479
 There are various things. 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:14.400
 a magx 24 roundabout 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:18.200
 Well I 7 bad do I'm ok and 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:23.840
 As expected, the latest Igomaru both are ok though 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:26.750
 Laurels was maybe I'd think that not only manufacturers and if detailed information so far 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.890
 Basically it should be the same too 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:36.430
 What about products that can be upgraded free of charge to windows 10 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.430
 I wonder Maybe the side caution feel no move to
