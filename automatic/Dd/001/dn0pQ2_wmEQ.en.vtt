00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
nuba Thomas series of stones this one is

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.980 
nuba Thomas series of stones this one is
as<00:00:12.240> yet<00:00:12.509> on<00:00:12.690> categorized<00:00:13.380> and<00:00:13.969> I<00:00:14.969> would<00:00:15.870> like

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
as yet on categorized and I would like

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.810 
as yet on categorized and I would like
to<00:00:16.049> get<00:00:16.289> some<00:00:16.350> feedback<00:00:16.740> from<00:00:16.920> some<00:00:17.369> people<00:00:17.699> of

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
to get some feedback from some people of

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.900 
to get some feedback from some people of
what<00:00:17.970> you<00:00:18.119> think<00:00:18.150> of<00:00:18.510> it<00:00:18.690> so<00:00:19.550> that<00:00:20.550> we<00:00:20.760> might

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
what you think of it so that we might

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.859 
what you think of it so that we might
include<00:00:21.270> it<00:00:21.449> in<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.600> future<00:00:23.480> one<00:00:24.480> of<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.689> two

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
include it in a future one of the two

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.769 
include it in a future one of the two
new<00:00:25.050> boo<00:00:25.199> Thomas<00:00:25.560> series<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:26.160> stones<00:00:26.510> so<00:00:27.510> again

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
new boo Thomas series of stones so again

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.030 
new boo Thomas series of stones so again
this<00:00:27.900> is<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.109> thousand<00:00:28.590> grit<00:00:28.769> stone<00:00:30.590> so<00:00:31.590> what

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
this is a thousand grit stone so what

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.610 
this is a thousand grit stone so what
we'll<00:00:32.550> start<00:00:32.910> off<00:00:33.059> by<00:00:33.390> checking<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.320> porosity

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
we'll start off by checking the porosity

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:42.040 
we'll start off by checking the porosity
of<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.070> stone<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:37.760> it<00:00:38.760> seems<00:00:39.149> like<00:00:39.300> it

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.160 

similar<00:00:43.050> rate<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.710> porosity<00:00:44.960> we'll<00:00:45.960> see<00:00:46.110> how

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
similar rate of porosity we'll see how

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:53.240 
similar rate of porosity we'll see how
quickly<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.680> saturates<00:00:51.500> okay<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:52.710> draws<00:00:52.980> in

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
quickly it saturates okay it draws in

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.790 
quickly it saturates okay it draws in
somewhat<00:00:53.789> slow<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:54.989> think<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.469> this<00:00:55.590> will

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
somewhat slow so I think that this will

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.819 
somewhat slow so I think that this will
be<00:00:56.000> pretty<00:00:57.000> close<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.750> splash<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.320> go<00:00:58.410> sort

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
be pretty close to a splash and go sort

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.870 
be pretty close to a splash and go sort
of<00:00:58.980> stone<00:01:01.520> what<00:01:02.520> we're<00:01:02.699> going<00:01:02.910> to<00:01:03.090> do<00:01:03.300> is<00:01:03.690> to

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:04.880 
of stone what we're going to do is to

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.679 
of stone what we're going to do is to
use<00:01:05.880> this<00:01:06.119> key<00:01:06.720> quechee<00:01:07.260> knife<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:08.420> put<00:01:09.420> a

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
use this key quechee knife and put a

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.960 
use this key quechee knife and put a
1000<00:01:10.680> grit<00:01:10.770> edge<00:01:10.950> on<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.490> see<00:01:11.640> how<00:01:11.670> well

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
1000 grit edge on it and see how well

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.620 
1000 grit edge on it and see how well
that<00:01:12.150> works<00:01:12.360> out<00:01:12.650> so<00:01:13.939> let's<00:01:14.939> see<00:01:17.509> okay<00:01:18.509> it

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
that works out so let's see okay it

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.770 
that works out so let's see okay it
looks<00:01:18.689> like<00:01:18.900> it's<00:01:19.939> holding<00:01:20.939> its<00:01:21.210> water<00:01:21.479> pretty

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
looks like it's holding its water pretty

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.620 
looks like it's holding its water pretty
well<00:01:21.990> already<00:01:24.259> so<00:01:25.259> I<00:01:25.790> think<00:01:26.790> at<00:01:27.060> this<00:01:27.180> point<00:01:27.240> we

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
well already so I think at this point we

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:35.749 
well already so I think at this point we
can<00:01:27.780> probably<00:01:28.229> go<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:31.729> spray<00:01:32.729> bottle<00:01:34.759> might

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
can probably go to spray bottle might

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.399 
can probably go to spray bottle might
need<00:01:35.939> just<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.270> bit<00:01:36.299> more<00:01:36.600> soaking<00:01:36.869> but<00:01:37.229> let's

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
need just a bit more soaking but let's

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.679 
need just a bit more soaking but let's
give<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.770> try<00:01:37.920> so<00:01:38.700> we're<00:01:39.360> going<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.600> go

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
give it a try so we're going to go

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.300 
give it a try so we're going to go
fairly<00:01:39.960> acute<00:01:40.530> on<00:01:40.680> this<00:01:40.890> edge<00:01:41.159> and

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.800 

okay<00:01:46.310> so<00:01:46.369> the<00:01:46.670> initial<00:01:46.880> texture<00:01:47.539> it's<00:01:47.659> a

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
okay so the initial texture it's a

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.330 
okay so the initial texture it's a
little<00:01:48.200> rough<00:01:48.380> but<00:01:48.619> I<00:01:48.740> think<00:01:49.009> that<00:01:49.159> this<00:01:49.280> is

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
little rough but I think that this is

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.910 
little rough but I think that this is
just<00:01:49.729> going<00:01:50.390> to<00:01:50.570> be<00:01:50.719> the<00:01:50.869> way<00:01:51.020> the<00:01:51.229> the<00:01:51.649> stone

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
just going to be the way the the stone

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.480 
just going to be the way the the stone
was<00:01:52.219> flattened<00:01:52.729> or<00:01:53.509> machined<00:01:54.109> initially<00:01:54.770> so

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
was flattened or machined initially so

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.389 
was flattened or machined initially so
it<00:01:55.670> should<00:01:55.880> smooth<00:01:56.240> out<00:01:56.450> a<00:01:56.479> fair<00:01:56.840> bit<00:01:57.340> okay<00:01:58.340> so

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
it should smooth out a fair bit okay so

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:03.639 
it should smooth out a fair bit okay so
immediately<00:01:59.210> we<00:01:59.619> see<00:02:00.700> sore<00:02:02.200> so<00:02:03.200> we<00:02:03.350> know<00:02:03.469> that

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
immediately we see sore so we know that

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:17.280 
immediately we see sore so we know that
this<00:02:03.770> will<00:02:03.979> be<00:02:04.009> an<00:02:04.189> aggressive<00:02:04.520> cutting<00:02:05.090> stone

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:36.069 

fairly<00:02:18.290> high<00:02:18.530> mud<00:02:34.569> listen<00:02:35.569> to<00:02:35.690> the<00:02:35.780> stone<00:02:36.049> a

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:36.079 
fairly high mud listen to the stone a

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:48.460 
fairly high mud listen to the stone a
little<00:02:36.440> bit<00:02:46.299> okay<00:02:47.299> so<00:02:47.360> i<00:02:47.629> can<00:02:47.810> tell<00:02:48.230> already

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
little bit okay so i can tell already

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.140 
little bit okay so i can tell already
that<00:02:48.799> the<00:02:49.239> surface<00:02:50.239> texture<00:02:50.810> is<00:02:52.150> revealing

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
that the surface texture is revealing

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.360 
that the surface texture is revealing
itself<00:02:54.190> and<00:02:56.200> it<00:02:57.200> is<00:02:57.410> a<00:02:57.440> good<00:02:57.709> bit<00:02:57.889> smoother

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
itself and it is a good bit smoother

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.410 
itself and it is a good bit smoother
than<00:02:59.560> the<00:03:00.560> initial<00:03:00.799> surface<00:03:01.489> texture<00:03:02.000> on<00:03:02.269> the

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
than the initial surface texture on the

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:15.140 
than the initial surface texture on the
stone<00:03:03.040> something<00:03:04.040> that<00:03:04.220> mr.<00:03:04.849> be<00:03:05.000> expected

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.630 

so<00:03:16.150> not<00:03:16.420> a<00:03:16.450> very<00:03:16.720> muddy<00:03:16.989> stone<00:03:17.380> you<00:03:18.220> can<00:03:18.400> see

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
so not a very muddy stone you can see

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:28.860 
so not a very muddy stone you can see
it's<00:03:18.790> very<00:03:19.000> fine<00:03:21.030> grit<00:03:27.120> it's<00:03:28.120> already<00:03:28.420> holding

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
it's very fine grit it's already holding

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.690 
it's very fine grit it's already holding
its<00:03:29.020> water<00:03:29.290> quite<00:03:29.590> well<00:03:29.830> so<00:03:29.860> i<00:03:30.160> would<00:03:30.459> consider

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
its water quite well so i would consider

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:34.470 
its water quite well so i would consider
this<00:03:32.100> pretty<00:03:33.100> much<00:03:33.280> of<00:03:33.400> a<00:03:33.489> splash<00:03:33.790> and<00:03:34.000> go<00:03:34.090> type

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
this pretty much of a splash and go type

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:41.809 
this pretty much of a splash and go type
stone<00:03:36.480> now<00:03:37.480> so<00:03:37.840> far<00:03:38.110> I'm<00:03:38.260> impressed<00:03:38.440> with<00:03:38.830> it

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:48.690

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
this side of it so you got since holding

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.509 
this side of it so you got since holding
its<00:04:17.470> water<00:04:17.709> very<00:04:17.979> nicely<00:04:20.130> probably<00:04:21.130> as<00:04:21.250> well

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
its water very nicely probably as well

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.740 
its water very nicely probably as well
or<00:04:21.850> better<00:04:21.880> than<00:04:23.010> any<00:04:24.010> of<00:04:24.220> the<00:04:24.340> other<00:04:24.750> 1000

or better than any of the other 1000
gritstones<00:04:26.910> cutting<00:04:27.910> action<00:04:28.090> is<00:04:28.479> good

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:28.919 
gritstones cutting action is good

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:53.029 
gritstones cutting action is good
feedback<00:04:29.919> is<00:04:30.190> good<00:04:31.590> Pleasant<00:04:32.590> stone<00:04:33.039> to<00:04:33.250> work

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:53.039 

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:58.890 

okay<00:04:54.039> very<00:04:54.340> nice<00:04:54.640> clean<00:04:55.090> edge<00:04:57.479> and<00:04:58.479> I<00:04:58.510> think

00:04:58.890 --> 00:04:58.900 
okay very nice clean edge and I think

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.480 
okay very nice clean edge and I think
this<00:04:59.020> will<00:04:59.169> be<00:04:59.229> a<00:04:59.350> fairly<00:04:59.650> short<00:04:59.979> video<00:05:00.430> for

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
this will be a fairly short video for

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:09.200 
this will be a fairly short video for
this<00:05:00.850> because<00:05:02.220> it<00:05:03.220> works<00:05:03.400> very<00:05:03.610> quickly

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.689 

so<00:05:10.210> let's<00:05:10.599> see<00:05:10.780> how<00:05:10.930> it<00:05:10.960> does<00:05:11.229> on<00:05:11.440> a<00:05:11.520> rolled<00:05:12.520> up

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:12.699 
so let's see how it does on a rolled up

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:17.879 
so let's see how it does on a rolled up
towel<00:05:13.710> quite<00:05:14.710> fast<00:05:15.990> let's<00:05:16.990> see<00:05:17.139> how<00:05:17.319> it<00:05:17.349> slices

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:17.889 
towel quite fast let's see how it slices

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:29.159 
towel quite fast let's see how it slices
paper<00:05:21.810> quick<00:05:23.550> doing<00:05:24.550> it<00:05:24.610> slow<00:05:26.039> push<00:05:27.039> cuts<00:05:28.169> push

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:29.169 
paper quick doing it slow push cuts push

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:43.550 
paper quick doing it slow push cuts push
cuts<00:05:29.500> further<00:05:29.949> out<00:05:40.830> nice<00:05:41.830> push<00:05:42.159> guides<00:05:42.460> I

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 
cuts further out nice push guides I

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.719 
cuts further out nice push guides I
would<00:05:44.560> write<00:05:44.710> this<00:05:44.860> an<00:05:45.009> excellent<00:05:45.400> stone<00:05:47.729> so

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:48.729 
would write this an excellent stone so

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:50.520 
would write this an excellent stone so
in<00:05:48.880> shorts<00:05:49.240> video<00:05:49.509> but<00:05:49.870> i<00:05:50.020> think<00:05:50.259> it's<00:05:50.409> an
