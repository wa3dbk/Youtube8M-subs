00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.109
 The best moment of my day is when I 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.960
 I'm in the classroom, you know this is a 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:12.450
 thing so far from me knows that 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.059
 It seems like every day I have to state 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.379
 inside of me that moment arrived 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.050
 so expected 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.430
 My name is camila has max show I have 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.550
 24 years 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.570
 I am from Cuiabá and live in Cáceres and 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.900
 three years 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.789
 I've always liked biology right from 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.369
 always with the first time I had 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:36.030
 contact with this subject I already liked 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.309
 Very bad, I went to the contest to 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.860
 necropsy technician here at home 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.329
 When I came to work here, I had to 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.239
 impression that my dream was 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.860
 far away when I heard that 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.230
 there would be medical school at unemat 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.840
 it was a huge happiness 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.170
 seven years ago told me it was on average 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.859
 three thousand three hundred today is 6,500 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:01.170
 Average if my mother is to donate right? 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.049
 My father has a life history that 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.240
 It started down this perhaps bancarem 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.630
 for six years, not with all 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:14.580
 fees and the extra expenses that this 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:19.439
 may also have the opportunity to 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:25.380
 I wanted to grab it was to mess with 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:27.930
 one of us today is several 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.030
 microscopes were bought right now 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.670
 I think about a half-year ago 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.170
 the opportunity to take a course 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.390
 neco is so with the correct and this course 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:42.479
 c / c offered by the state because until 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.310
 so it was only federal is an opportunity 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.640
 Wonderful 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:51.740
 Look, my mother, she helped me a lot, right? 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.740
 My father also because 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.620
 because he is an example to me I know one 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:02.560
 person who has had much much less 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:04.990
 opportunities that I can not 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.870
 A lot of things I try to enjoy the most 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.690
 It's all that comes to me ahead. 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.790
 that all people who did not have 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.880
 financial conditions of paying a course 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.710
 as medicine had conditions and 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.680
 opportunity to study in a 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.590
 public university in the course of these 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:27.700
 next five years 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:29.800
 I can achieve this dream and I 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.080
 Yes it can be a good average a good 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.890
 professional is that I can contribute 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.570
 for society and what I want to do 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.230
 surgery 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.230
 I want to be the surgery
