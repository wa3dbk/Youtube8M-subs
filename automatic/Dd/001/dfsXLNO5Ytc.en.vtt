going<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:46.700> zigzag<00:00:49.940> it<00:00:50.940> doesn't<00:00:51.420> have<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.899> be

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
going to zigzag it doesn't have to be

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.119 
going to zigzag it doesn't have to be
precise

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129

we're<00:00:53.699> just<00:00:53.910> quilting<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.480> two<00:00:54.840> pieces

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
we're just quilting the two pieces

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.799 
we're just quilting the two pieces
together<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:56.370> actually<00:00:56.789> gives<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.149> nice<00:00:57.360> look

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
together it actually gives a nice look

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:06.929 
together it actually gives a nice look
when<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.410> is<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.949> little<00:00:59.730> bit<00:00:59.940> wavy<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.780> crazy

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:06.939 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:11.710 

I'm<00:01:07.939> just<00:01:08.270> going<00:01:08.570> back<00:01:08.840> and<00:01:08.899> forth<00:01:09.820> in<00:01:10.820> a<00:01:11.420> rough

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
I'm just going back and forth in a rough

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:17.740 
I'm just going back and forth in a rough
way<00:01:15.430> you<00:01:16.430> could<00:01:16.670> do<00:01:16.850> this<00:01:17.060> also<00:01:17.390> with<00:01:17.720> a

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
way you could do this also with a

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.010 
way you could do this also with a
contrasting<00:01:18.680> thread<00:01:19.060> if<00:01:20.060> you<00:01:20.509> want<00:01:20.720> to<00:01:20.810> see

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
contrasting thread if you want to see

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:34.100 
contrasting thread if you want to see
the<00:01:21.170> pattern

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.569 

there<00:01:35.110> you<00:01:35.200> go<00:01:35.530> and<00:01:35.619> guess<00:01:35.860> when<00:01:36.070> you<00:01:36.189> finish

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:36.579 
there you go and guess when you finish

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:40.109 
there you go and guess when you finish
just<00:01:36.610> end<00:01:37.119> by<00:01:37.329> knotting<00:01:37.899> it<00:01:38.049> and<00:01:39.090> trim<00:01:40.090> your

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
just end by knotting it and trim your

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.350 
just end by knotting it and trim your
threads<00:01:40.329> close<00:01:41.290> I'm<00:01:42.100> then<00:01:42.610> I'm<00:01:42.759> going<00:01:43.030> to<00:01:43.090> go

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
threads close I'm then I'm going to go

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.570 
threads close I'm then I'm going to go
around<00:01:43.689> the<00:01:43.840> edges<00:01:44.049> and<00:01:44.590> just<00:01:44.830> finish<00:01:45.280> off

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
around the edges and just finish off

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.910 
around the edges and just finish off
with<00:01:45.610> a<00:01:45.909> zig-zag<00:01:46.270> stitch<00:01:46.570> to<00:01:47.229> hold<00:01:47.439> those<00:01:47.590> two

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
with a zig-zag stitch to hold those two

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.039 
with a zig-zag stitch to hold those two
pieces<00:01:48.159> together<00:01:48.520> and<00:01:49.000> to<00:01:49.420> keep<00:01:49.570> the<00:01:49.780> fabric

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:50.049 
pieces together and to keep the fabric

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:53.460 
pieces together and to keep the fabric
from<00:01:50.320> fraying<00:01:50.920> this<00:01:51.850> will<00:01:52.060> be<00:01:52.240> on<00:01:52.479> the<00:01:52.659> inside

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
from fraying this will be on the inside

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.090 
from fraying this will be on the inside
of<00:01:53.890> the<00:01:54.520> bag<00:01:54.810> so<00:01:55.810> you<00:01:56.200> don't<00:01:56.380> have<00:01:56.470> to<00:01:56.649> worry<00:01:56.830> so

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
of the bag so you don't have to worry so

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.469 
of the bag so you don't have to worry so
much<00:01:57.159> about<00:01:57.280> finishing<00:01:58.030> it<00:01:58.090> but<00:01:58.240> you<00:01:58.299> don't

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
much about finishing it but you don't

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.359 
much about finishing it but you don't
want<00:01:58.659> the<00:01:58.869> fabric<00:01:59.080> fraying<00:01:59.679> on<00:01:59.830> the<00:01:59.890> inside

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
want the fabric fraying on the inside

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.859 
want the fabric fraying on the inside
now<00:02:01.119> if<00:02:01.299> you<00:02:01.450> have<00:02:01.780> a<00:02:02.520> overlock<00:02:03.520> machine<00:02:03.869> this

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
now if you have a overlock machine this

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:06.779 
now if you have a overlock machine this
is<00:02:05.049> a<00:02:05.080> nice<00:02:05.350> thing<00:02:05.740> to<00:02:05.920> do<00:02:06.039> with<00:02:06.220> the<00:02:06.310> overlock

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
is a nice thing to do with the overlock

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:09.240 
is a nice thing to do with the overlock
machine<00:02:06.850> if<00:02:07.630> you<00:02:08.170> don't<00:02:08.200> have<00:02:08.679> the<00:02:08.830> overlock

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
machine if you don't have the overlock

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.270 
machine if you don't have the overlock
machine<00:02:09.310> a<00:02:09.970> simple<00:02:10.450> zigzag<00:02:11.019> will<00:02:11.260> do<00:02:11.440> so<00:02:11.980> set

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
machine a simple zigzag will do so set

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.199 
machine a simple zigzag will do so set
your<00:02:12.400> stitch<00:02:12.790> width<00:02:13.330> to<00:02:14.319> 4<00:02:14.769> and<00:02:15.069> your<00:02:15.910> stitch

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
your stitch width to 4 and your stitch

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:18.630 
your stitch width to 4 and your stitch
length<00:02:16.540> you<00:02:16.930> can<00:02:17.049> keep<00:02:17.319> at<00:02:17.560> 2<00:02:17.890> and<00:02:18.069> a<00:02:18.130> half<00:02:18.340> and

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
length you can keep at 2 and a half and

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.509 
length you can keep at 2 and a half and
we're<00:02:19.120> going<00:02:19.269> to<00:02:19.480> zigzag<00:02:19.780> around<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:21.130> bottom

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:21.519 
we're going to zigzag around the bottom

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:31.450 
we're going to zigzag around the bottom
section

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.580 

you<00:02:32.460> want<00:02:32.640> to<00:02:32.760> stop<00:02:33.150> and<00:02:33.480> pivot<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:34.140> machine

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
you want to stop and pivot the machine

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.720 
you want to stop and pivot the machine
pivot<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.720> material<00:02:36.720> at<00:02:36.990> the<00:02:37.110> corner<00:02:38.630> and

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
pivot the material at the corner and

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.180 
pivot the material at the corner and
this<00:02:41.730> will<00:02:41.940> just<00:02:42.210> keep<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:43.140> fabric<00:02:43.620> from

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
this will just keep the fabric from

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:51.070 
this will just keep the fabric from
fraying

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:03:00.560 

and<00:02:52.080> the<00:02:52.860> last<00:02:53.100> side<00:02:58.760> and<00:02:59.760> to<00:03:00.120> end<00:03:00.300> you<00:03:00.540> just

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
and the last side and to end you just

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.690 
and the last side and to end you just
back<00:03:01.020> up<00:03:01.260> a<00:03:01.350> little<00:03:01.470> that<00:03:01.740> helps<00:03:02.100> to<00:03:02.340> knot<00:03:02.670> the

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
back up a little that helps to knot the

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.780 
back up a little that helps to knot the
