00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.069
 a completely different tutorials tournament 

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:06.799
 and it is controversial 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:10.009
 and I did yesterday at lidl 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:12.610
 bought arrived strict this effect 

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:15.739
 because I want to do very well 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:19.160
 Now here this nockis where I thought 

00:00:15.739 --> 00:00:21.369
 that is the effect that is he is 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.599
 but not 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.759
 This wool is actually for beginners 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:27.980
 very tricky I got it last time 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:29.449
 knitted 25 years ago or so and there 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.829
 there was not this kind of art yet or 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.980
 I do not know her, I only know her 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:34.789
 normal want to stretch so knew 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.530
 at first not like it 

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:39.140
 works and unfortunately this is strict 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.350
 instructions that are advertised as big 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.329
 on the packaging rather a joke that 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.320
 special about this yarn is it has so 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.820
 choose a net here see fishing net 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.309
 and with this garden with this net 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:56.750
 actually, thereby knitting man but 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:01:00.500
 this effect is achieved so now i show 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.969
 you guys here with the yarn almost the 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:05.600
 mesh really absorbs that 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:07.310
 simply with the ghanaer does not have to now 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.930
 the page with where the defects are 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.560
 but take the other side here 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.930
 that the net unravel a bit and 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.050
 go up here in the first mesh 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.270
 front to back 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.720
 then you pull the net back in 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.340
 the texts again from the front to the back 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.910
 here again the next one from the beginning 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.860
 behind and so on the mesh 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.920
 record is really the easiest 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:38.140
 I think the rest is in this garden 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:42.770
 pretty much getting used to and 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:46.190
 tricky a few stitches on then 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:49.160
 he turns all around and you 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:54.230
 here a little bit of euro for Hungary 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:55.220
 principle is here in the first in the first 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:59.860
 mesh a 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.860
 look up here the first rhombus 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:14.510
 So first mesh purely first rhombus and 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.220
 pull through and off and on and on and so on 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.900
 continue 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:23.540
 always see that half way 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:28.450
 Here again in the next machine here 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:35.079
 Tighten and turn again 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:40.370
 pull through next stitch 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:45.829
 so far, so to speak, so far in the end 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:48.200
 Then there are three more that 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:51.170
 stupid is always this year is turning 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:54.130
 also with that is part of the effect because 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.660
 The scarf is turned in the end so in itself 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.970
 and therefore too fat and likely 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.569
 but that will of course be 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.170
 the processing still makes it difficult 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:06.859
 even more 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.329
 at least for I feel that as at 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:09.100
 Last time we go there too 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:13.670
 on 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:17.000
 take as to because here the first we lozenge 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:20.269
 always have to see that you if 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.430
 you diamonds always have the next one 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:25.880
 So take these then this comes 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:28.850
 does this happen and then it always works like this 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:32.480
 has further as you can see 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:34.040
 after the 2 3 against the so a bit 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.420
 offset one above the other and the more pure 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.670
 you have more of these 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.680
 staggered pompons you have the whole 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.780
 turns in and looks a lot 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.120
 very nice from another special feature 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.079
 where the yarn is you can do it until the 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.329
 knit 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:49.160
 that is, if when the yarn to now 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:53.239
 end and you would have now that would be 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:56.569
 the last red then you stretch that way 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:58.250
 and then take the next stitch and 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.940
 likes to use the new one simply with the 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:02.430
 very first roasted on the cook 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.400
 in that this is one in itself 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.650
 you need a closed system 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.480
 really great not to knot 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.630
 or somehow you can do that then 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:16.040
 after that later the provider still but it 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:19.190
 nothing can happen 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:23.520
 at the end is normally handled as 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:25.650
 with each other also stretch and me 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.990
 Show yourself now like the end 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.750
 So this looks like the finished scarf 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:33.420
 Yesterday I knitted it like 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.400
 So you see it really nice thick 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.860
 sausage with many well as the 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.110
 lay one over the other is the scarf itself 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.000
 turned a bit and me 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.850
 find it also very nice and there 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:47.100
 comfortable to wear 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:49.620
 Now I hope that I am a bit 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.490
 could help and put some light into the dark 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:52.770
 could bring 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.450
 since I am of the opinion that the 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:58.200
 Instructions on the packaging really 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:05:00.680
 us miserable so until next thank you 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.680
 for watching
