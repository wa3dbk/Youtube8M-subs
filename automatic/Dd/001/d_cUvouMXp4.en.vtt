00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
lag or whatever stuff but I chose with

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.110

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.849 
for I believe game sound volume the top
right<00:04:12.840> is<00:04:12.870> for<00:04:13.440> the<00:04:13.829> normal<00:04:14.340> kind<00:04:14.910> of<00:04:15.060> sound<00:04:15.449> if

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:15.859 
right is for the normal kind of sound if

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:17.870 
right is for the normal kind of sound if
you're<00:04:16.859> just<00:04:17.010> playing<00:04:17.250> like<00:04:17.370> a<00:04:17.459> single<00:04:17.729> player

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
game I guess the third one is for like a

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:23.689 
game I guess the third one is for like a
stadium<00:04:22.500> like<00:04:22.830> you<00:04:23.190> know<00:04:23.280> if<00:04:23.370> you're<00:04:23.490> playing
