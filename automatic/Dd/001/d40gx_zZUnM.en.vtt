00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.410 

now<00:03:59.230> I'm<00:03:59.409> curious<00:03:59.680> if<00:04:00.370> I<00:04:00.580> can<00:04:00.760> make<00:04:00.940> it<00:04:00.970> in<00:04:01.239> the

now I'm curious if I can make it in the

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.770 
now I'm curious if I can make it in the
remaining<00:04:01.810> time<00:04:02.200> from<00:04:03.190> the<00:04:03.610> Louisville<00:04:03.879> to

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:21.009 

start<00:04:19.099> to<00:04:19.310> look<00:04:19.519> out<00:04:19.729> for<00:04:20.060> free<00:04:20.509> flood<00:04:20.810> after

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
start to look out for free flood after

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.999 
start to look out for free flood after
every<00:04:21.709> 20<00:04:22.310> or<00:04:22.460> 25<00:04:23.270> minutes<00:04:23.720> and<00:04:23.930> not<00:04:24.650> in<00:04:24.860> the

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
last minute because often a lot of the

last minute because often a lot of the
newer<00:04:28.639> station<00:04:29.330> are<00:04:29.449> full<00:04:29.930> so<00:04:30.530> you<00:04:30.590> need<00:04:30.919> to

00:04:31.059 --> 00:04:31.069 
newer station are full so you need to

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:34.029 
newer station are full so you need to
find<00:04:31.370> another<00:04:31.569> but<00:04:32.569> that<00:04:32.900> shouldn't<00:04:33.379> be<00:04:33.620> too

00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:34.039 
find another but that shouldn't be too

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:36.760 
find another but that shouldn't be too
difficult<00:04:34.069> as<00:04:34.759> there<00:04:35.419> is<00:04:35.629> usually<00:04:36.020> another

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
difficult as there is usually another

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:48.890 
difficult as there is usually another
nearby

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.890 

done<00:04:50.490> that<00:04:51.490> took<00:04:51.730> me<00:04:51.910> another<00:04:52.120> ten<00:04:52.480> minutes

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
done that took me another ten minutes

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.390 
done that took me another ten minutes
