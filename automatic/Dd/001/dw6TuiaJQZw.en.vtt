00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.069
 good evening guys tech oh how are you 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:13.259
 beautiful city ​​and I will why ships 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:16.560
 they will not be iron and iron on 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.590
 the water is sinking a good question yes try 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.779
 let's figure it out and me 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:27.060
 Teddy on ships do not allow the ground 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:30.800
 To understand we skip from plasticine 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.930
 the ball is as heavy as the iron 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.649
 I wonder how this ball you really need 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.070
 it was now you see a teddy bear 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.620
 ready 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:46.230
 we drop it into the water and fall to 108 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.680
 proved we proved that the ball of 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:56.120
 plasticine dance and now we are from this 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:01:06.030
 ball blind vodka boat let's blind 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:09.150
 wide boat with you entered. I'm swimming 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:14.250
 already would say plasticine by the way 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:19.970
 the coast which is well the boat is ready 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.970
 will experience will experience so 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:31.650
 whores you know I do not understand what a way 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.930
 plasticine and have a ball drowned while a boat and 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.479
 him 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:39.810
 swims for the same reason why iron sinks a 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.940
 iron ships are floating form too 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.210
 arma is important 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:48.960
 until the boat sinks due to its shape 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.450
 it has air and air is lighter than water and 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.470
 he helps the boat to keep afloat 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:57.210
 a horse to this ship is such what is needed 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:06.390
 to keep him afloat 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:07.649
 correct teddy bear of course special in 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.039
 sea ​​water is salty 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:14.430
 does salt water help to swim up 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:19.069
 I want to help you prove it to any 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:23.160
 then see we need an egg 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:26.489
 a bowl of water and a bowl of salt 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.220
 water now we drop there an egg and what 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:32.820
 we see 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:38.630
 after all drowned right now we get 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:38.630
 egg add water more salt 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.000
 stir to salt faster 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:52.980
 dissolved and you need to wait a little 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:57.440
 while the water is light now interesting and 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.440
 that now will be patient Phil 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:15.239
 after this and now we drop the egg in 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:17.310
 salt water when we added to water 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.040
 salt water became denser 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.890
 the egg itself is not very heavy and in 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:25.049
 more dense water she swims and you 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.799
 bibigon sea water will help too 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.799
 learn to swim 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:35.099
 hotel take two saucers 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:43.610
 and then in each saucer we pour water and 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:43.610
 now add salt to one saucer 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:53.870
 put our saucers in the cold 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:57.209
 freezer interesting well that's all and 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:04:00.780
 Now we can talk about salt and what about 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:04.290
 their only salt is what she wants 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:06.180
 More alena accurately and you know that 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.620
 only a small part of the salt gets to us 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.370
 on the table with food 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:15.299
 and where to go worth frail on the roads 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:17.789
 the house pours salt correctly in winter 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:20.100
 crunches under your feet and on it and spent 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:22.949
 much but the main part of salt 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.139
 goes to the production of very important things 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:29.160
 Oh 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:30.860
 But let's see what is produced with 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:35.370
 using sony 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:40.500
 let's see for example 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:44.280
 salt goes to the production of soap soap soap 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:46.650
 with which we wash our hands and more 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:51.060
 salt is used in production 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:52.889
 paper that's it and to do that 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.240
 glass need salt 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:59.060
 and even salt helps keep the products 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:09.990
 here it is 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:17.070
 Well it's time to look at our saucer oh 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:19.440
 look at one thing all right simple 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:22.770
 water froze and turned to ice 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:25.380
 and salt water is not frozen simple water 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.539
 freezes and with a little frost a 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.520
 frozen salt water is needed very 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:32.819
 severe frost 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:36.330
 I understand why do Vasya 

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:39.870
 road salted so that the snow melted on it 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:42.270
 eat then not frozen and not turned 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:45.180
 in the ice is exactly absolutely true if 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:49.139
 salt on ice for a slippery road 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:52.819
 melts like this and now my dear 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:52.819
 let's watch cartoon dudes
