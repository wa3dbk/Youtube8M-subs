the<00:00:03.480> nucleus<00:00:03.959> is<00:00:04.200> one<00:00:04.410> of<00:00:04.529> the<00:00:04.589> key<00:00:04.830> things

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
the nucleus is one of the key things

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.619 
the nucleus is one of the key things
that<00:00:05.279> when<00:00:05.400> you<00:00:05.520> ever<00:00:05.819> you<00:00:06.060> see<00:00:06.299> it<00:00:06.390> you<00:00:06.600> know

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
that when you ever you see it you know

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.570 
that when you ever you see it you know
you're<00:00:06.899> looking<00:00:07.020> at<00:00:07.259> a<00:00:07.319> eukaryotic<00:00:07.859> cell<00:00:08.099> and

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
you're looking at a eukaryotic cell and

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.419 
you're looking at a eukaryotic cell and
it<00:00:09.120> is<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:09.570> brain<00:00:10.019> or<00:00:10.410> control<00:00:10.920> center<00:00:11.280> of<00:00:11.309> the

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
it is the brain or control center of the

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.180 
it is the brain or control center of the
cell<00:00:11.550> because<00:00:12.450> it<00:00:12.599> has<00:00:13.019> the<00:00:13.290> DNA<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:14.009> DNA

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
cell because it has the DNA the DNA

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.890 
cell because it has the DNA the DNA
holds<00:00:14.670> the<00:00:14.969> genes<00:00:15.269> which<00:00:15.599> are<00:00:15.750> the

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
holds the genes which are the

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.080 
holds the genes which are the
instructions<00:00:16.529> of<00:00:16.770> how<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.010> build<00:00:17.369> your<00:00:17.580> cell

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
instructions of how to build your cell

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.670 
instructions of how to build your cell
and<00:00:18.330> how<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.720> operate<00:00:19.170> your<00:00:19.289> cell

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
and how to operate your cell

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.980 
and how to operate your cell
now<00:00:20.369> there's<00:00:20.760> three<00:00:21.029> major<00:00:21.330> things<00:00:21.810> that

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
now there's three major things that

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.410 
now there's three major things that
you'll<00:00:22.170> see<00:00:22.609> indicated<00:00:23.609> on<00:00:23.760> a<00:00:23.789> diagram<00:00:24.269> of

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
you'll see indicated on a diagram of

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.029 
you'll see indicated on a diagram of
this<00:00:24.480> nucleus<00:00:25.260> that<00:00:25.439> you<00:00:25.529> need<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.800> know<00:00:25.920> about

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
this nucleus that you need to know about

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.710 
this nucleus that you need to know about
and<00:00:26.279> that's<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.490> nuclear<00:00:26.910> envelope<00:00:27.060> the

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
and that's the nuclear envelope the

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.540 
and that's the nuclear envelope the
chromatin<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.410> nucleolus<00:00:28.859> let's<00:00:29.400> take<00:00:29.519> a

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
chromatin and the nucleolus let's take a

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.730 
chromatin and the nucleolus let's take a
look<00:00:29.760> at<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:29.970> cell<00:00:30.210> here<00:00:31.199> we<00:00:31.380> see<00:00:31.529> in<00:00:31.650> the

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
look at the cell here we see in the

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.470 
look at the cell here we see in the
centre<00:00:31.980> of<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.189> cell<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.850> nucleus<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.420> in

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
centre of the cell the nucleus and in

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.000 
centre of the cell the nucleus and in
fact<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.780> word<00:00:33.930> nucleus<00:00:34.410> actually<00:00:34.829> means

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
fact the word nucleus actually means

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.869 
fact the word nucleus actually means
Center<00:00:35.600> so<00:00:36.600> on<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.920> outside<00:00:38.370> you'll<00:00:38.579> see<00:00:38.730> the

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
Center so on the outside you'll see the

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.610 
Center so on the outside you'll see the
nuclear<00:00:39.210> envelope<00:00:39.570> that's<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.230> double

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
nuclear envelope that's the double

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.190 
nuclear envelope that's the double
membrane<00:00:41.070> of<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.730> nucleus<00:00:42.239> through<00:00:42.989> it

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
membrane of the nucleus through it

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.049 
membrane of the nucleus through it
you'll<00:00:43.379> see<00:00:43.620> small<00:00:44.070> openings<00:00:44.670> those<00:00:44.879> are

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
you'll see small openings those are

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.639 
you'll see small openings those are
called<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.329> nuclear<00:00:45.719> pores<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.320> those<00:00:46.469> are

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
called the nuclear pores and those are

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.430 
called the nuclear pores and those are
the<00:00:46.739> structures<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.309> allow<00:00:47.899> messenger<00:00:48.899> RNA

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
the structures that allow messenger RNA

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.160 
the structures that allow messenger RNA
mRNA<00:00:49.680> for<00:00:50.430> short<00:00:50.760> in<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.420> out<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.719> cell<00:00:51.960> in

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
mRNA for short in and out of the cell in

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.170 
mRNA for short in and out of the cell in
order<00:00:52.320> for<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.800> get<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.250> ribosomes<00:00:53.760> so

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
order for it to get to the ribosomes so

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.939 
order for it to get to the ribosomes so
that<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.570> cell<00:00:54.930> can<00:00:55.079> make<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.320> proteins<00:00:55.770> as

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
that the cell can make the proteins as

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.580 
that the cell can make the proteins as
per<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.640> directions<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.270> DNA<00:00:57.570> now<00:00:58.320> within

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
per the directions of the DNA now within

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.209 
per the directions of the DNA now within
the<00:00:58.949> nucleus<00:00:59.460> you'll<00:01:00.120> find<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:01.020> DNA<00:01:01.289> now<00:01:01.800> DNA

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
the nucleus you'll find the DNA now DNA

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.140 
the nucleus you'll find the DNA now DNA
is<00:01:02.760> in<00:01:03.470> normal<00:01:04.470> cells<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:05.159> in<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.640> form<00:01:05.909> called

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
is in normal cells is in the form called

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.359 
is in normal cells is in the form called
chromatin<00:01:06.869> and<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.590> word<00:01:07.890> that<00:01:08.070> literally

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
chromatin and a word that literally

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.490 
chromatin and a word that literally
means<00:01:08.670> colored<00:01:09.150> stuff<00:01:09.450> with<00:01:09.630> nitrogen<00:01:10.049> in<00:01:10.350> it

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
means colored stuff with nitrogen in it

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.460 
means colored stuff with nitrogen in it
so<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.549> chromatin<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.479> DNA<00:01:12.990> which<00:01:13.290> is

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
so the chromatin is the DNA which is

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.130 
so the chromatin is the DNA which is
wrapped<00:01:13.920> up<00:01:14.100> loosely<00:01:14.640> on<00:01:14.939> proteins<00:01:15.900> and

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
wrapped up loosely on proteins and

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.260 
wrapped up loosely on proteins and
through<00:01:17.100> its<00:01:17.340> throughout<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.880> cell<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.180> they

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
through its throughout the cell and they

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.300 
through its throughout the cell and they
call<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.600> colored<00:01:18.900> stuff<00:01:19.140> with<00:01:19.320> nitrogen<00:01:20.159> in

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
call it a colored stuff with nitrogen in

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.679 
call it a colored stuff with nitrogen in
it<00:01:20.340> because<00:01:20.909> when<00:01:21.060> they're<00:01:21.180> first<00:01:21.360> looking

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
it because when they're first looking

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.390 
it because when they're first looking
through<00:01:21.840> cells<00:01:22.110> or<00:01:22.590> looking<00:01:23.040> at<00:01:23.159> cells

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
through cells or looking at cells

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.010 
through cells or looking at cells
through<00:01:23.549> microscopes<00:01:24.060> they<00:01:24.630> couldn't<00:01:24.930> see

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
through microscopes they couldn't see

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.960 
through microscopes they couldn't see
anything<00:01:25.259> so<00:01:25.439> they<00:01:25.680> started<00:01:26.009> adding<00:01:26.189> dyes<00:01:26.580> and

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
anything so they started adding dyes and

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.420 
anything so they started adding dyes and
they<00:01:27.060> added<00:01:27.509> a<00:01:27.900> dye<00:01:28.049> that<00:01:28.290> stuck<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.829> nucleic

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
they added a dye that stuck to nucleic

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.850 
they added a dye that stuck to nucleic
acids<00:01:29.939> like<00:01:30.090> DNA<00:01:30.119> and<00:01:30.810> so<00:01:31.110> what<00:01:31.259> they<00:01:31.380> saw<00:01:31.590> was

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
acids like DNA and so what they saw was

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.380 
acids like DNA and so what they saw was
hey<00:01:32.100> there's<00:01:32.340> colored<00:01:32.670> stuff<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.060> we<00:01:33.150> know<00:01:33.270> it

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
hey there's colored stuff and we know it

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.910 
hey there's colored stuff and we know it
has<00:01:33.450> nitrogen<00:01:33.930> in<00:01:34.079> it<00:01:34.110> so<00:01:34.500> we'll<00:01:34.590> call<00:01:34.799> it

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
has nitrogen in it so we'll call it

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.380 
has nitrogen in it so we'll call it
colored<00:01:35.220> stuff<00:01:35.460> with<00:01:35.610> nitrogen<00:01:35.970> in<00:01:36.240> it

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
colored stuff with nitrogen in it

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.350 
colored stuff with nitrogen in it
chromatin<00:01:36.990> now<00:01:37.890> they<00:01:38.310> saw<00:01:38.579> sometimes<00:01:39.090> that

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
chromatin now they saw sometimes that

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.850 
chromatin now they saw sometimes that
there<00:01:39.479> will<00:01:39.570> be<00:01:39.600> other<00:01:39.840> regions<00:01:40.500> within<00:01:40.710> the

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
there will be other regions within the

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.120 
there will be other regions within the
nucleus<00:01:41.369> that<00:01:41.400> got<00:01:42.240> even<00:01:42.540> darker<00:01:43.110> we<00:01:43.770> know<00:01:43.920> now

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
nucleus that got even darker we know now

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.310 
nucleus that got even darker we know now
that's<00:01:44.399> because<00:01:44.790> right<00:01:45.689> there<00:01:45.990> in<00:01:46.200> the

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
that's because right there in the

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.830 
that's because right there in the
nucleolus<00:01:46.799> which<00:01:47.040> means<00:01:47.549> little<00:01:48.060> center<00:01:48.689> of

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
nucleolus which means little center of

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.620 
nucleolus which means little center of
the<00:01:49.170> center<00:01:49.470> thing<00:01:49.649> we<00:01:50.549> have<00:01:50.790> not<00:01:51.030> just<00:01:51.270> DNA

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
the center thing we have not just DNA

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.170 
the center thing we have not just DNA
but<00:01:51.780> we<00:01:51.990> also<00:01:52.140> have<00:01:52.470> another<00:01:52.920> kind<00:01:53.670> of<00:01:53.850> nucleic

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
but we also have another kind of nucleic

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.499 
but we also have another kind of nucleic
acid<00:01:54.600> called<00:01:54.869> ribosomal<00:01:55.619> RNA<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.579> so<00:01:57.119> because

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
acid called ribosomal RNA and so because

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.600 
acid called ribosomal RNA and so because
that<00:01:57.540> ribosomal<00:01:58.259> RNA<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:58.890> being<00:01:58.920> made<00:01:59.340> right

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
that ribosomal RNA is being made right

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.270 
that ribosomal RNA is being made right
here<00:01:59.640> in<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.180> nucleolus<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.320> collects<00:02:01.979> more

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
here in the nucleolus it collects more

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.420 
here in the nucleolus it collects more
of<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.520> stain<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:02.939> looks<00:02:03.210> darker<00:02:03.600> so<00:02:04.500> to

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
of the stain and looks darker so to

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.639 
of the stain and looks darker so to
summarize<00:02:06.000> we<00:02:06.210> have<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.810> nucleus<00:02:07.229> with<00:02:07.469> the

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
summarize we have the nucleus with the

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.109 
summarize we have the nucleus with the
nuclear<00:02:07.979> envelope<00:02:08.190> on<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.459> outside<00:02:08.849> with

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
nuclear envelope on the outside with

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
nuclear pores delao sub substances in

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.820 
nuclear pores delao sub substances in
and<00:02:11.400> out<00:02:11.520> we<00:02:12.060> have<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.390> DNA<00:02:12.690> typically<00:02:13.620> in<00:02:13.709> the

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
and out we have the DNA typically in the

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:14.360 
and out we have the DNA typically in the
form<00:02:14.069> call
