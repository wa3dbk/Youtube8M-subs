00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:13.309
 then climbing for me is one 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.050
 therefore continuous research in the first place of the 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:16.850
 travel is still in search of 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.770
 line of hips in very situations 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.950
 closer to our reality 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.360
 on the journey then undoubtedly 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:26.119
 exploration, that is, finding something 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.970
 new is the key element that makes 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.490
 an extraordinary experience to find 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.230
 new lines find new new environments 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.090
 and above all new people with whom 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.600
 behaving in my opinion are the elements 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:41.270
 key to making it so motivating and 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.250
 nice our activity to continue 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.640
 to change continue to explore e 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.949
 search for something new 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.379
 we are here in a way with a time 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:52.840
 bongio finished then a certain point of 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.219
 view we must make the most of 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.620
 finished that is around us 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:01.039
 It is obvious that we will never succeed 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.809
 explore it to research anything 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:04.760
 not even a positive thing for the new ones 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.430
 generations we say he has in the 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.040
 complicated by the amount of rock per 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.210
 the quantities of places will not be will not be 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.940
 never finished i think 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.710
 we say that every place is every region 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.440
 in my opinion it is characterized as well as 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.020
 from the type of rock of the type of environment 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.159
 precisely from these a story 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.659
 cultural and in my opinion it is enough 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.300
 combined with the environment itself 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.770
 and it is fascinating as well as discovering 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.759
 the environment try to also 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.369
 contextualize what they were 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:42.920
 historical steps to get into 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:45.570
 that place is in that moment of lute 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.759
 started climbing around 13 14 years 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:51.390
 in as I have said before in mine 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.460
 small reality of vicenza and eli mo ma 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.920
 there has been an increase in growth 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.450
 also in the places explored in the 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.869
 known experiences in people 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:04.350
 known and in my opinion is the journey is 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.149
 what gave me some values 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.570
 which brings divisions into life that 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.459
 we are here passing by and therefore many 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.069
 sometimes it is better not to dwell on certain 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.290
 banality of life itself and therefore 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.170
 this growth as a man has brought me 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:22.829
 really to value more things for us 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.370
 important and really and above all 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:26.670
 relations decisions 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.670
 people
