buy a pump I guess oh so one plus about
it<00:01:30.909> is<00:01:31.090> that<00:01:31.330> it<00:01:31.600> already<00:01:31.840> has<00:01:32.170> a<00:01:32.200> pump<00:01:32.640> now

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
it is that it already has a pump now

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:42.419 
it is that it already has a pump now
this<00:01:34.830> was<00:01:38.610> $26<00:01:39.610> and<00:01:39.970> this<00:01:40.149> was<00:01:40.360> 30<00:01:40.630> to<00:01:40.929> 50<00:01:41.590> but

00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:42.429 
this was $26 and this was 30 to 50 but

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:49.469 
this was $26 and this was 30 to 50 but
this<00:01:43.210> one<00:01:43.450> gives<00:01:43.810> you<00:01:43.990> a<00:01:44.020> little<00:01:44.409> bit<00:01:44.530> more<00:01:48.479> now

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:49.479 
this one gives you a little bit more now

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.930 
this one gives you a little bit more now
I'd<00:01:50.110> like<00:01:50.770> the<00:01:51.280> match<00:01:51.580> master<00:01:52.119> better<00:01:52.390> because

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
I'd like the match master better because

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.039 
I'd like the match master better because
it<00:01:54.940> blends<00:01:55.840> ends<00:01:56.649> better<00:01:56.920> with<00:01:57.850> my<00:01:58.030> face<00:01:58.330> in<00:01:58.690> my

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 
it blends ends better with my face in my

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.789 
it blends ends better with my face in my
skin<00:01:59.380> tone<00:01:59.619> because<00:01:59.770> the<00:02:00.009> NC<00:02:00.369> 50<00:02:00.729> it<00:02:00.940> doesn't

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
skin tone because the NC 50 it doesn't

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.410 
skin tone because the NC 50 it doesn't
match<00:02:02.799> exactly<00:02:03.369> so<00:02:04.979> it's<00:02:05.979> like<00:02:06.340> it's<00:02:06.909> not<00:02:07.090> off

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
match exactly so it's like it's not off

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.150 
match exactly so it's like it's not off
but<00:02:07.930> you<00:02:08.079> can<00:02:08.109> kind<00:02:08.470> of<00:02:08.530> tell<00:02:08.709> it<00:02:08.739> to<00:02:09.009> in

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
but you can kind of tell it to in

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.210 
but you can kind of tell it to in
foundation<00:02:09.549> but<00:02:10.329> with<00:02:10.509> the<00:02:10.720> match<00:02:11.260> master<00:02:11.920> it

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
foundation but with the match master it

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.420 
foundation but with the match master it

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.550 
are other reviews on that but I guess
it's<00:04:30.340> good<00:04:30.610> for<00:04:30.910> if<00:04:31.030> you<00:04:31.150> have<00:04:31.330> oily<00:04:31.780> skin<00:04:31.810> or

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
it's good for if you have oily skin or

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.730 
it's good for if you have oily skin or
just<00:04:33.460> oily<00:04:34.270> liking<00:04:34.600> your<00:04:34.720> t-zone<00:04:35.020> or<00:04:35.290> whatever

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740 
just oily liking your t-zone or whatever

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.740 
just oily liking your t-zone or whatever
but<00:04:36.040> I<00:04:36.160> don't<00:04:36.340> really<00:04:36.430> have<00:04:36.580> oily<00:04:37.150> skin<00:04:37.450> but<00:04:37.690> I

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
but I don't really have oily skin but I

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.580 
but I don't really have oily skin but I
just<00:04:38.050> used<00:04:38.290> it<00:04:38.590> to<00:04:39.510> kind<00:04:40.510> of<00:04:40.600> smooth<00:04:41.110> out<00:04:41.350> my

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
just used it to kind of smooth out my

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.490 
just used it to kind of smooth out my
skin<00:04:42.070> so<00:04:42.850> I<00:04:42.880> can<00:04:43.210> put<00:04:43.360> my<00:04:43.390> before<00:04:44.080> I<00:04:44.140> put<00:04:44.320> on<00:04:44.350> my

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
skin so I can put my before I put on my

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.590 
skin so I can put my before I put on my
foundation<00:04:46.590> but<00:04:47.590> I<00:04:47.890> think<00:04:48.700> that's<00:04:49.030> it<00:04:49.240> if<00:04:49.480> you

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 
foundation but I think that's it if you

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.050
