00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:09.269
 today I wanted to talk about credit 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:12.440
 of some tips of some tricks for 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.509
 keep nails or nails long 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.530
 then I will make myself like a 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:19.440
 maintenance 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:22.020
 my first nail that is removed and 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.650
 will start I'll follow me taking them away I'll 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.760
 to return when not all 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.910
 square what happens if I have them 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.130
 already very long 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.820
 those of cutting me the short cuts 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.030
 they grow back 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:40.150
 so because later when he gives me 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.070
 I'm shorter, I'm not touching 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:45.060
 straight so that when I get the lines that 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.060
 come as little squares 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:57.180
 this little glass grows back 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:01:00.900
 what there are girls then I already returned already 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.520
 I cut my nails and I lime what 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.660
 let's do now let's make ourselves 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:11.490
 a as a deep treatment the 

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:14.600
 hands or a mini cream exfoliation that 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.600
 you use 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:24.500
 of the cream that you use and we're going 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:26.780
 to take sugar by opening tl or something 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.070
 He does not want to give us a massage 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.070
 good rich in the hands 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.360
 already afterwards when they finish they go to 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.570
 rinse hands well with water 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.500
 Libya 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:47.030
 I think it has been useful that I am going to give them 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:51.000
 so that the nails grow 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:55.340
 let's grab a little cream 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.340
 and we are not going to put them on each nail 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.950
 to do is we're going to take the 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:04.800
 cuticle back to the cuticle this 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.090
 part quote from here of the nail that sometimes 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.149
 in the people who have them as 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.520
 elongated or have it stuck by some 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:15.240
 reason that does not help them that the signal of 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.980
 grow up very well I do not know this equally 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.900
 they can not do it with scissors or with 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.460
 nothing because even if it is participated 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:25.050
 here they mistreat her or something can be 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:27.120
 infect then slowly we 're not going 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.860
 to take back slowly you do not owe them 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.170
 hurt my nothing because it's really a 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.000
 tiny 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.190
 they have it and pegadito is not going to 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.530
 serve anything so I'm going to give 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.810
 so that the nails will grow a 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.940
 keep the graffiti right now I 'm going 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.160
 to paint but it is very important to keep 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.720
 the painted ones because every time we 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.510
 we wash our hands when we are washing 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.120
 the dishes and we have to wash everything 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.470
 that we have to do that we have to 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.470
 This one that has to be good 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:58.440
 hands nails painted this helps us 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.480
 protect it until they are weakened that 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.040
 it's like a protective layer then 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.569
 you do not like colors the 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.530
 They can paint glitter or color 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.530
 pastry 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:14.810
 there are many things that can make a 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.430
 can grab a little head of garlic the 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.129
 stain also crushed is crushed 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:22.340
 and in a transparent nail polish on a 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:26.090
 shine they put the garlic there and leave it 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:28.280
 macerate not for a few days and when 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:31.010
 they paint that will help them equally 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.989
 they are cooking and they are chopping garlic like this 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.519
 the garlic water can pass it like this 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.290
 by the nails and him when they finished 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:38.689
 kitchen salam your hands well and you already have 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.879
 an onion in half or try to 

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:42.590
 Take out the onion and that myth 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:44.719
 they join it in the nails and also that 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.790
 it's very good something else when sometimes 

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:49.310
 they have stained nails that have them 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.650
 as yellow the lemon 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.480
 lemon with a cotton quoted has been made 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:56.720
 They leave it for a while and washed well 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:04:00.370
 hands I have my little video and see you 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.370
 in the next one that is very well peace
