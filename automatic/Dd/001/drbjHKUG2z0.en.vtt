00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.550 
Kentucky hick prepara stash me some
questions<00:00:03.120> about<00:00:03.240> fries<00:00:03.689> and<00:00:03.899> cheese<00:00:04.170> and<00:00:04.470> I

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
questions about fries and cheese and I

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.840 
questions about fries and cheese and I
thought<00:00:04.710> they<00:00:04.890> were<00:00:04.950> good<00:00:05.190> questions<00:00:05.400> so<00:00:05.819> I

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
thought they were good questions so I

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.099 
thought they were good questions so I
thought<00:00:06.120> that<00:00:06.270> I<00:00:06.299> would<00:00:06.480> do<00:00:06.569> a<00:00:06.600> video<00:00:06.870> about

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
thought that I would do a video about

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.759 
thought that I would do a video about
this<00:00:07.560> they<00:00:08.280> saw<00:00:08.519> a<00:00:08.550> video<00:00:08.820> that<00:00:09.179> I<00:00:09.240> did<00:00:09.360> about

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:09.769 
this they saw a video that I did about

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:11.720 
this they saw a video that I did about
vacuum-sealing<00:00:10.769> cheese<00:00:11.219> with<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:11.610> little

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
vacuum-sealing cheese with a little

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.299 
vacuum-sealing cheese with a little
snorkel<00:00:12.599> type<00:00:12.900> vacuum<00:00:13.410> sealer<00:00:13.830> that<00:00:13.860> I<00:00:14.009> have

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
snorkel type vacuum sealer that I have

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.000 
snorkel type vacuum sealer that I have
because<00:00:15.120> of<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.330> design<00:00:15.630> of<00:00:15.660> that<00:00:16.010> vacuum

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
because of the design of that vacuum

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.400 
because of the design of that vacuum
sealer<00:00:17.430> I'm<00:00:17.730> able<00:00:18.210> to<00:00:18.240> vacuum<00:00:19.020> seal<00:00:19.050> the

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
sealer I'm able to vacuum seal the

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.200 
sealer I'm able to vacuum seal the
cheese<00:00:19.680> right<00:00:20.010> in<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.310> bags<00:00:20.520> that<00:00:20.730> they<00:00:21.000> come

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
cheese right in the bags that they come

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.080 
cheese right in the bags that they come
in<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:21.689> it<00:00:22.170> saves<00:00:22.439> quite<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:22.769> bit<00:00:22.980> of<00:00:23.100> money<00:00:23.279> and

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
in and it saves quite a bit of money and

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.880 
in and it saves quite a bit of money and
I'll<00:00:24.390> put<00:00:24.600> a<00:00:24.630> link<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:25.140> that<00:00:25.260> video<00:00:25.470> in<00:00:25.859> the

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
I'll put a link to that video in the

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
break the seal on that vacuum when you

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.400 
break the seal on that vacuum when you
take<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.510> out<00:01:00.600> of<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.870> freezer

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
take it out of the freezer

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.810 
take it out of the freezer
and<00:01:01.680> then<00:01:01.890> throw<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.309> food<00:01:02.489> in<00:01:02.730> the

and then throw the food in the
refrigerator<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.930> problem<00:01:04.320> is<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.739> have<00:01:04.769> the

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
refrigerator the problem is you have the

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.039 
refrigerator the problem is you have the
prime<00:01:05.189> conditions<00:01:05.729> there<00:01:05.970> for<00:01:06.180> botulism<00:01:06.540> if

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
prime conditions there for botulism if

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.230 
prime conditions there for botulism if
that<00:01:07.200> package<00:01:07.590> reaches<00:01:08.010> room<00:01:08.220> temperature<00:01:08.280> so

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
that package reaches room temperature so

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.390 
that package reaches room temperature so
to<00:01:09.840> be<00:01:09.990> on<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.170> safe<00:01:10.380> side<00:01:10.409> break<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.159> seal

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
to be on the safe side break that seal

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.800 
to be on the safe side break that seal
as<00:01:11.850> soon<00:01:12.060> as<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.270> take<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.540> out<00:01:12.659> of<00:01:12.689> the

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
as soon as you take it out of the

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.560 
as soon as you take it out of the
freezer<00:01:13.580> so<00:01:14.580> here's<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.060> cheddar<00:01:15.299> cheese

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
freezer so here's the cheddar cheese

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.020 
freezer so here's the cheddar cheese
after<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.020> thought<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.530> out<00:01:16.710> yes<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.580> smush<00:01:17.850> is

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
after I thought it out yes that smush is

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.179 
after I thought it out yes that smush is
down<00:01:18.330> but<00:01:18.900> it<00:01:19.560> also<00:01:19.770> flushed<00:01:20.310> back<00:01:20.549> up<00:01:22.189> they

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
down but it also flushed back up they

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.100 
down but it also flushed back up they
wanted<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.850> know<00:01:24.060> if<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.450> noticed<00:01:24.840> any

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
wanted to know if I noticed any

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.320 
wanted to know if I noticed any
deterioration<00:01:25.530> in<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.310> cheese<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:27.119> either

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
deterioration in the cheese and either

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.020 
deterioration in the cheese and either
the<00:01:27.570> texture<00:01:27.990> or<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.320> quality<00:01:28.829> I<00:01:29.030> really

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
the texture or the quality I really

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.030 
the texture or the quality I really
don't<00:01:30.270> notice<00:01:30.869> any<00:01:31.259> difference<00:01:31.770> in<00:01:31.920> the

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
don't notice any difference in the

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.789 
don't notice any difference in the
cheese<00:01:32.310> if<00:01:32.759> there's<00:01:33.180> anything<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.409> very

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
cheese if there's anything it is very

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.090 
cheese if there's anything it is very
minor<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.939> might<00:01:36.360> be<00:01:36.720> just<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.439> little<00:01:37.500> bit

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
minor it might be just a little bit

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.179 
minor it might be just a little bit
sharper<00:01:38.759> than<00:01:39.180> it<00:01:39.450> was<00:01:39.659> initially<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.530> it

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
sharper than it was initially and it

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.700 
sharper than it was initially and it
might<00:01:41.460> be<00:01:41.670> just<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:42.119> tad<00:01:42.150> drier<00:01:42.869> it's<00:01:43.290> hard<00:01:43.530> to

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
might be just a tad drier it's hard to

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.370 
might be just a tad drier it's hard to
say<00:01:43.890> because<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.310> don't<00:01:44.549> know<00:01:44.759> what<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.119> was

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
say because I don't know what it was

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.499 
say because I don't know what it was
originally<00:01:46.380> but<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.310> is<00:01:47.430> absolutely<00:01:48.240> fine<00:01:48.479> to
