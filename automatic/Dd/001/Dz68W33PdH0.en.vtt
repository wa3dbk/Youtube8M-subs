00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
bad bad bad action film so hopefully

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.080 
bad bad bad action film so hopefully
somehow<00:00:39.239> he's<00:00:39.450> learned<00:00:40.219> how<00:00:41.219> to<00:00:41.280> make<00:00:41.700> a<00:00:41.760> good

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
somehow he's learned how to make a good

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.510 
somehow he's learned how to make a good
action<00:00:42.600> film<00:00:43.020> oh<00:00:43.170> he<00:00:43.440> also<00:00:43.559> did<00:00:43.829> transporter<00:00:44.340> 3

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
action film oh he also did transporter 3

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.130 
action film oh he also did transporter 3
which<00:00:44.730> is<00:00:44.760> easily<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.360> worst<00:00:45.450> in<00:00:45.809> that<00:00:45.930> series

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
which is easily the worst in that series

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.440 
which is easily the worst in that series
too<00:00:46.440> so<00:00:46.920> hopefully<00:00:47.160> this<00:00:47.760> will<00:00:47.969> end<00:00:48.210> up<00:00:48.420> being

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
too so hopefully this will end up being

crappy movie this year I haven't seen
that<00:03:53.240> though<00:03:53.600> for<00:03:53.810> some<00:03:53.840> reason<00:03:54.170> but<00:03:54.590> a<00:03:54.620> walk

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
that though for some reason but a walk

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.160 
that though for some reason but a walk
among<00:03:55.280> them<00:03:55.370> too<00:03:55.550> so<00:03:55.850> that<00:03:56.540> looks<00:03:56.780> really<00:03:56.960> good

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
among them too so that looks really good

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:58.660 
among them too so that looks really good
i<00:03:57.230> thought<00:03:57.470> the<00:03:57.590> action<00:03:57.950> actually<00:03:58.220> looked

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
i thought the action actually looked

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:00.700 
i thought the action actually looked
like<00:03:58.790> it<00:03:58.910> was<00:03:59.000> being<00:03:59.210> well<00:03:59.390> filmed<00:03:59.930> you<00:04:00.560> can

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:00.710 
like it was being well filmed you can

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:01.930 
like it was being well filmed you can
tell<00:04:00.860> Liam<00:04:01.070> Neeson's<00:04:01.370> getting<00:04:01.580> a<00:04:01.610> little<00:04:01.730> old

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
tell Liam Neeson's getting a little old

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.180 
tell Liam Neeson's getting a little old
so<00:04:02.150> it's<00:04:02.270> not<00:04:02.360> no<00:04:02.840> role<00:04:03.110> like<00:04:03.320> hand-to-hand

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
so it's not no role like hand-to-hand

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.150 
so it's not no role like hand-to-hand
fights<00:04:04.400> it<00:04:04.550> look<00:04:04.640> like<00:04:04.790> a<00:04:04.820> lot<00:04:05.030> of<00:04:05.240> uh<00:04:06.160> look

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
fights it look like a lot of uh look

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.100 
fights it look like a lot of uh look
like<00:04:07.340> a<00:04:07.370> lot<00:04:07.550> of<00:04:07.700> shooting<00:04:08.510> and<00:04:08.690> stuff<00:04:08.870> which

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
like a lot of shooting and stuff which

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.530 
like a lot of shooting and stuff which
was<00:04:09.290> a<00:04:09.320> lot<00:04:09.560> of<00:04:09.770> why<00:04:10.370> I<00:04:10.640> thought<00:04:11.030> taking<00:04:11.300> to

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
was a lot of why I thought taking to

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.150 
was a lot of why I thought taking to
kind<00:04:11.840> of<00:04:11.870> sexist<00:04:12.350> because<00:04:12.500> there<00:04:12.770> wasn't<00:04:12.920> too

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
kind of sexist because there wasn't too

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.800 
kind of sexist because there wasn't too
much<00:04:13.310> hand-to-hand<00:04:13.910> combat<00:04:14.300> and<00:04:14.420> when<00:04:14.660> there

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
much hand-to-hand combat and when there

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.260 
much hand-to-hand combat and when there
was<00:04:15.020> it<00:04:15.380> was<00:04:15.530> so<00:04:15.710> cha<00:04:16.190> Polly<00:04:16.489> edited<00:04:17.000> it<00:04:17.150> was

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:20.960 
just insane but looks like they kind of

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.810 
just insane but looks like they kind of

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.850 
good for them uh to me I think they're
very<00:04:35.510> generic<00:04:36.170> pretty<00:04:36.440> much<00:04:36.530> all<00:04:36.740> the<00:04:36.830> time

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
very generic pretty much all the time

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.590 
very generic pretty much all the time
the<00:04:37.220> only<00:04:37.550> really<00:04:37.850> good<00:04:37.880> one<00:04:38.210> in<00:04:38.330> the<00:04:38.450> last

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
the only really good one in the last

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.480 
the only really good one in the last
couple<00:04:39.050> years<00:04:39.230> to<00:04:39.650> me<00:04:39.800> and<00:04:40.040> it<00:04:40.310> might<00:04:40.460> be

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
couple years to me and it might be

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.850 
couple years to me and it might be
missing<00:04:40.910> one<00:04:41.090> of<00:04:41.810> the<00:04:41.990> other<00:04:42.140> one<00:04:42.290> I<00:04:42.320> can<00:04:42.830> think

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
missing one of the other one I can think

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.740
