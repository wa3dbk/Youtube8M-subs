where I'll be studying and also to talk
to<00:00:25.260> future<00:00:25.560> tutors<00:00:25.950> so<00:00:26.760> I<00:00:26.789> can<00:00:26.970> find<00:00:27.150> out<00:00:27.270> a<00:00:27.330> bit

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
to future tutors so I can find out a bit

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.660 
to future tutors so I can find out a bit
more<00:00:27.510> about<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.930> course<00:00:28.140> I<00:00:28.560> just<00:00:29.400> wanted<00:00:29.610> to

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
more about the course I just wanted to

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.550 
more about the course I just wanted to
find<00:00:29.789> out<00:00:29.940> more<00:00:30.210> about<00:00:30.270> university<00:00:31.020> life<00:00:31.230> and

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
find out more about university life and

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.520 
find out more about university life and
the<00:00:31.890> closest<00:00:32.219> are<00:00:32.340> unavailable<00:00:33.530> probably

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
the closest are unavailable probably

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.600 
the closest are unavailable probably
just<00:00:34.620> really<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:34.980> facilities<00:00:35.489> around

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
just really the facilities around

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.010 
just really the facilities around
because<00:00:36.000> that's<00:00:36.239> what<00:00:36.390> takes<00:00:36.600> you<00:00:36.720> out<00:00:36.840> first

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
because that's what takes you out first

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.080 
because that's what takes you out first
in<00:00:37.290> it<00:00:37.470> then<00:00:38.070> you<00:00:38.190> see<00:00:38.370> what<00:00:38.489> cost<00:00:38.730> your<00:00:38.910> firm

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
in it then you see what cost your firm

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.180 
in it then you see what cost your firm
what<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.570> night<00:00:39.690> lands<00:00:39.870> like<00:00:40.079> after<00:00:40.320> that<00:00:40.350> so

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
what the night lands like after that so

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.190 
what the night lands like after that so
mainly<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.910> facilitation<00:00:42.390> really<00:00:42.810> I<00:00:43.020> think

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
mainly the facilitation really I think

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.770 
mainly the facilitation really I think
it's<00:00:43.649> very<00:00:43.739> helpful<00:00:44.130> as<00:00:44.579> we<00:00:44.880> get<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.210> know<00:00:45.360> how
