00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:11.040
 The cat I kept was dead 

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:14.240
 I saw it at a pet crematory and I heard strange noises in nowhere home 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:18.470
 Colon this this 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:24.020
 Sounds like an animal turning over on the floor 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:27.350
 It was a song of our cat that rolls around everywhere on a hot star 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:32.150
 Maybe that child came back 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:36.170
 I felt a little bit more energetic spending my days 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:40.079
 Also when I go to bed at night, sometimes on the futon 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:42.480
 I came to feel the weight on the belly 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.750
 Somewhat nostalgic weight 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:50.300
 I can not open my eyes while feeling the weight 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:53.030
 I used to sleep well with that girl 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:57.500
 It curls in the futon 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:01:02.620
 Summer nights like this are hot and wicked. 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:04.059
 There is a strange sense of security in this way 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.830
 But something 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:12.850
 Much more than in memory 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.850
 A little laugh from north guy heaven Tsu left 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:22.950
 Sleep on a futon as usual on a bright night of the moon 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.950
 I felt the weight as usual when I tried to hit it 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.520
 I also came today 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:34.500
 Mutual mention a little 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:34.500
 I could see the beautiful moon from the fall talk circle when I turned my eyes to the side without the run 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.820
 I felt sleepy and unclear with the feeling I got a little 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:48.090
 I noticed there 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:55.770
 I do not know why I can open my eyes today 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:58.300
 If you look at the weight under which you think and feel because you can see the figure of that child after a long time 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:02.090
 There was a woman 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:04.690
 A woman with long hair and no legs 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:08.069
 It 's on the futon 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.789
 I was watching over my belly 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.930
 With eyes 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.130
 It laughed 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.900
 The woman Oh 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.960
 While making a body without limbs 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.720
 Eyes come over the futon 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:28.090
 What happens if you get close to the face 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:30.690
 What dawn Thus came the labor from outside the room in the can not be hamstrung fear 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.110
 I heard the cat crying 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.350
 When the mind with 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.300
 It was morning 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:40.550
 I do not understand 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:48.620
 Was that yesterday a dream? 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:50.760
 Osol-When I got up, I saw a futon that was split up for biribly and long hair that laid eggs 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:57.470
 It was not a dream 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:58.550
 That woman I was Tei come to pearl every night in the lion with no body at home 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.370
 It is 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:06.340
 Cat's cries heard just before losing mind 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:10.500
 It should have been said that La's son 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:10.500
 I think that it might have helped me
