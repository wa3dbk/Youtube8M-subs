00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
back inside right then what it does is

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.369 
back inside right then what it does is
it<00:01:01.500> takes<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:02.010> tool<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.730> hit<00:01:02.940> last<00:01:03.359> and<00:01:03.809> it
