00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.950
 If I tell you to spend more than 500 hours 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:09.759
 to play the fahl out flip arias and that is 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:12.459
 500 hours in days are more than 20 days 

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:14.320
 24 hours without releasing the command without eating and 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:16.240
 doing nothing more than playing the 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.040
 video game console had finally created the 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.400
 best post apocalyptic game of the 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:24.070
 obviously this is for something 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.270
 and is that he sees since he did very well and he 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.740
 he worked very hard 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.440
 you just have to look at the little ones 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.810
 details in the story on how it is 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.390
 told in which each object each weapon 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.149
 square with what you see in that aesthetic of 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.370
 the 50s with technology superior to the 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:41.499
 that we currently have but that to the 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.989
 pair gives you the impression of being in the 

00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:45.699
 cold and good war this is not going to be a 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:48.280
 Summary video of the previous games 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:50.079
 but it's going to be history and everything 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.420
 what happened before the 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.370
 world of fall out for it if you want 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.969
 play the fall out 4 and you want to be fine 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.909
 aware 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:00.149
 you will need to know what happened before this 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:00.149
 game 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.470
 the world of fall out 4 follows a line 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.299
 temporary different from the history of 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.549
 real world until the great war in the 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.350
 2000 77 the world of fault was 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.750
 dominated by the culture of the decade 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.270
 the 50 but with many more advances 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.070
 technological and is that the great war was 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.990
 the nuclear conflict that plunged the world 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.149
 in chaos and destruction from 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.200
 then the world stopped being like 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:30.210
 we knew 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.619
 It is worth mentioning that all this disaster 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.170
 came in the wake of the oil shortage 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.330
 that put all nations to the test 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.549
 maybe this is a vision of what we 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.709
 wait for us in the future all 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.330
 these events did not arise from the 

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:45.600
 overnight this all had a 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.979
 process and started in April 2000 52 in 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.640
 which begins the war of the 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.530
 resources 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.959
 Europe invades the Middle East with the 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.420
 hope to gain their resources and 

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:56.819
 its oilfields later 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.920
 in May of the same year the UN is at 

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:01.229
 edge of collapse many countries the 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.600
 they leave and this causes that in July this 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.700
 organism disappear completely in 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.869
 consequence the us close their 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.420
 borders and start a career 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.070
 weapons unprecedented at the time 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.810
 that increase the military presence in 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.700
 alaska to preserve his last 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.099
 active oil source after this 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.880
 Canada and the USA begin to engage 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:22.680
 talks later 2066 china it 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.989
 is on the verge of collapse due to 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.880
 the shortage of fossil fuels in a 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.560
 last attempt to alleviate this situation 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.989
 has invades alaska and is done with the 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.630
 control of oil reserves 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:35.489
 U.S 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.380
 the US sends its defenses in summer of that 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.330
 year and in winter the line is established 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.040
 of wide law and it is here where the 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.500
 fruits of those conversations between 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.930
 Canada and the USA since Canada allows 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.340
 us the American soldiers cross 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.440
 your borders to get to alaska 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.299
 by a sure way seeing that the war 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.940
 the congress of the 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:56.670
 The US approves the annexation with Canada in the 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.530
 2000 67 with Canadian help the 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.959
 Americans get to launch an offensive 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:03.420
 and break the enemy line and take back the 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:06.150
 occupied positions in width ten years 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.610
 later in 2000 77 finally alaska 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.020
 is released events that we can 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.960
 revive in one of the times 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.940
 3 as to who threw the bombs 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.430
 nuclear is not yet known to science 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.200
 certain who was the first but what 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:22.180
 yes you know is that when these countries 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.520
 they saw the nuclear bombs in their 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.240
 radars decided to attack the countries 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.640
 neighbors 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:31.120
 all this caused a nuclear attack to 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:35.290
 world scale on October 23, 2000 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:37.360
 77 that lasted 2 years in 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.510
 As for the affected areas, the first 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.370
 it was the west coast of the USA following a 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.260
 trajectory towards the center and then 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.000
 to the east coast 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.830
 after these attacks they were lost 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.990
 communications without much technology 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.210
 so we can assume that China 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.400
 he also suffered the same fate as usa 

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.630
 and that surely will be painted with 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.730
 we waste desolate 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:59.890
 obviously there was no formal end 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.450
 for war but simply the 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.820
 there is no more answer among the 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.920
 opponents war operations are 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.140
 suspended from the rest of the planet 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.820
 There is no news either but it is very 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.820
 likely to have suffered all 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:15.370
 countries a luck similar to that of the USA and 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.180
 Chinese governments disappeared except 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.310
 one that 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.250
 called the enclave and that seems to be the 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.289
 successor to the government of the USA but 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.300
 what happened to all the people with all the 

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:28.060
 animals that lived in the cities of 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.860
 USA it is estimated that less than half of 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:31.060
 the world population survived the 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.979
 great nuclear war 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.410
 most lived in the dark with the 

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:37.660
 misery for decades also living 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.300
 in underground or frozen vaults in 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.979
 cryogenic cameras most of the 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.470
 people who did not enter the shelters 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:47.110
 they were murdered and many who had 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:50.199
 good luck or bad luck 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.940
 living suffered serious mutations and in 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:53.889
 the desolate wilderness where they usually live 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.930
 these monsters or these animals 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:57.940
 mutated we also have bandits 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.800
 humans who will take care of giving us 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:03.130
 many problems throughout the 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.470
 adventures years after the bombs 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.389
 the shelters were launched they started to 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:09.940
 open up and its inhabitants went out to 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:12.370
 rebuild the destroyed civilization 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.889
 after more than 80 years the region 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.960
 Central America and its refuges 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:18.650
 they were the first to open up and start 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.050
 to create new civilizations 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.030
 and from that to the game you are a denizen of 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.800
 one of the shelters and you will have to explore 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:27.110
 the wilderness in search of resources for 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:30.229
 survive you will have a system to measure 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.610
 your actions if they are good or are bad and 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:33.650
 all these actions will have 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:36.199
 consequences in the future and in the 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.550
 history of the same game and good yet 

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:40.160
 There are many subjects and many curiosities 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.990
 for playing in the following videos the 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.389
 what will we see if this type of video 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.220
 It has a welcome if it has like or if it has 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:47.600
 many visualizations or even if 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.340
 you ask me in the box 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.560
 comments so you know 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.300
 pop the like button in the video 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.430
 and by the way before I go I want 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.680
 tell them one thing and you will say that damn 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:59.389
 heavy with what 's in game it worth is 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.800
 that I'm really a bit heavy but 

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:02.990
 It's worth it and if it is that 

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.490
 the physical game interests nothing but if not 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.440
 you want the physical game and you're going to 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.210
 catch for espn if you buy it and from 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.160
 This store is going to have a lot 

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:12.260
 cheaper than steam and it's also a 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.820
 reliable store usually when I go 

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.229
 to buy a nesting game first I 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.910
 I went through this page to see what 

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:18.770
 prices has and always is usually 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.360
 much cheaper I say nothing more 

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:22.220
 that's how we see each other in the 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.330
 next video thank you very much for 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.220
 have been there if you thought 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.290
 interesting as you already commented 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:29.150
 supports the video to have more content 

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:31.640
 of fall out and see you in the next 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:34.250
 video video summary review or gameplay 

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:38.740
 lately I know I do not do that 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:38.740
 be good and see you later 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.290
 and that is another 

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:50.500
 the best game in the world had been created 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:53.020
 Poses golden cup and mystic to the 

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:54.940
 moment we must mention that the great 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:58.330
 war came from what to do is 

00:06:54.940 --> 00:07:02.910
 The vending in Front Gernán in May 

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.910
 same year on May 1 of the same year 

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:10.880
 and consequently the USA that carry 

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:15.470
 your borders start a race to 

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:17.510
 upset and this is where the fruit comes 

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:19.480
 of those conversations between the us and 

00:07:17.510 --> 00:07:21.430
 alaska no 

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:23.110
 at the moment the only government that is 

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:25.780
 present in the fallout saga is the 

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:28.680
 enclave that proclaims itself the heir of 

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:28.680
 USA 

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:34.230
 that the heir of the 

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:38.030
 government of the united states of 

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:41.040
 america suffered serious mutations 

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:44.580
 they suffered mutations they suffered 

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:47.220
 mutations suffered mutations like this is 

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:50.930
 you already know how to pop the like button 

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:50.930
 I'm out of voice and everyone
