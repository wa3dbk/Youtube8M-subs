00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:08.320
 so when you're here as 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:13.150
 commander for duke the ur2 soldier for 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:14.350
 where beats geo what less grace 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.050
 make 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:19.540
 the open arms program that will have given 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:23.470
 this uniform but we are still 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:26.190
 enemies well let's solve this as 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.190
 enemies 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:41.329
 the hearts you had no reputation for trying 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:44.059
 very well to the prisoners sure not to 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:46.750
 you know nothing of that 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:49.770
 I would not say that 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:53.790
 you do not look like a man who accepts orders 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.790
 because he will continue bild 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.980
 you could say that he had a motive 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.980
 hidden 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.700
 as I grew up in the url I had heard 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:21.580
 of the mythical mansions of jal bobby 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.580
 but I never imagined that I would see them like that 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.150
 the larvae have destroyed this neighborhood your 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.620
 Professor lives here 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:35.330
 I'm sure he's still alive 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.330
 nothing sure 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.790
 is the fault 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.370
 and an excellent result 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.660
 we have women 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.630
 when the session 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.160
 two 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.080
 go 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:11.050
 we have to continue there is a good 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:14.210
 stretch to elliot's house 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:17.410
 in a statue like that in my peace 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.410
 you have a patio 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:47.780
 we can press 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:47.780
 why 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.780
 the more 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:13.690
 and an excellent result 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.430
 why 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:19.699
