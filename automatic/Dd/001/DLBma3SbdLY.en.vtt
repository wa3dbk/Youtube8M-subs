you want to rather than open up cydia
later<00:03:51.540> and<00:03:51.840> add<00:03:52.019> them<00:03:52.260> in<00:03:52.470> it's<00:03:52.769> again<00:03:53.370> it's<00:03:53.400> a

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
later and add them in it's again it's a

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.159 
later and add them in it's again it's a
small<00:03:53.940> shortcut<00:03:54.450> but<00:03:54.630> again<00:03:54.870> it's<00:03:55.049> an
