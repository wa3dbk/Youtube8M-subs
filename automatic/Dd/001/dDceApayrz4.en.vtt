00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
would have been faster than that but a

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.170 
would have been faster than that but a
90<00:04:18.230> speed<00:04:18.440> isn't<00:04:18.590> bad<00:04:18.859> you<00:04:19.579> know<00:04:19.700> I<00:04:19.730> mean<00:04:19.910> maybe

90 speed isn't bad you know I mean maybe

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.510 
90 speed isn't bad you know I mean maybe
we<00:04:20.329> could<00:04:20.480> put<00:04:20.600> him<00:04:20.780> in<00:04:20.989> on<00:04:21.260> RICO<00:04:21.829> spell<00:04:22.190> him<00:04:22.340> in
