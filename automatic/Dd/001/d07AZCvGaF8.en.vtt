 then we are going to put strips 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.659
 approximately with a separation of 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:06.600
 about 4 centimeters of agreement then 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:09.300
 let's start doing the work 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.050

 strips that look like a martini on the 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.190
 help in this cute decorated paper that 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.130
 we have to love to use two 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:29.569
 colors has thus valued an environment more 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.569
 lower lower and so nothing else 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:41.660
 draw some flowers doubt draw your 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:41.660
 flowers can be this point the molds 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.950
 of different length this is the ideal and 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.450
 Leonians to keep the regular ones 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.950
 so if you want to comment night that 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.810
 He started for money 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.910
 11 perfect and later we'll see east 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.400
 which reported problem 4 centimeters 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.019
 and if they are like me that suddenly gives us 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.840
 his little face draw we do not have too 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:07.920
 pulse already know that with lily always 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.480
 let's have the facebook then the mold 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.769
 to be treated in their papers 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.470
 decorated that can buy any 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.540
 stationery also split us if they see that 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.209
 something there is something that does not get this 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.430
 then optional nice with these 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:22.110
 thin now are the thin slats 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.319
 or for everything with the new ones like 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.090
 interspersed by altering the thickness and that 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:28.920
 he will also give a touch as well 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.540
 for example they come to cut us 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.630
 You can also buy stickers not 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.940
 stickers this leagues are like me 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.829
 they wanted to call this we need nice 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.480
 they are already made so it is very 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:41.069
 easy give it to me distributed facebook and you 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.519
 is going to give this to mate that combines very 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:46.170
 well with my papers to choose as we 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.750
 they save a lot of work so I'm going to 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.390
 start tracing butterfly along with 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.130
 are you want funds pluris people 5 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.870
 more or less Cuba 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.130
 in the list of materials I do not include 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.140
 It is a drilling machine remember that 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:01.590
 needles the drills that we 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.600
 reported to the figure if correctly 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.610
 then if you want you can cut 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.050
 also with that if sometimes the 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.600
 really do not want to spend if it's not 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.880
 what do you do for professional journeys like this? 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.980
 that you want to buy other material that the 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.980
 perforator is what you can draw here 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.530
 is marked me and my butterfly I'm going to 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:25.110
 cut twice because twice for 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:27.720
 what can we do in the room what 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:31.950
 what happens for a letter a headline or 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:34.020
 if the web is not on the web at 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:38.330
 strike I said we will activate the web or 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.330
 I said name and sexting 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:47.729
 modernity will look for the payroll if he 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.750
 and I think we cut it in half and 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:50.750
 what we have left 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:59.099
 if you already lower the scissors that by the way 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.680
 is that I'm going to pass a data but we 

00:04:59.099 --> 00:05:05.400
 I believe a lot living avn then their 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:08.729
 dams were a success they will like to see 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.620
 the mold already knew how good 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:13.380
 Patricia is a very nice option as 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.970
 shoot that is complete 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.460
 for this character in the cartoon 

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:20.729
 also what if I can add anything 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:23.070
 clear and remember if you missed it 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:26.130
 You can put in the page of Teresa 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:29.789
 there you can put them in videos 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:31.979
 and then we go to creative space there 

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:33.680
 where abuse is still alive and nothing Misses 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:35.729
 stool 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.680
 click on it to see all the 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:40.969
 videos of all the programs this 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:47.959
 skinny but serves as a stool 

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:49.549
 skinny but he took risks I do not know if 

00:05:47.959 --> 00:05:51.709
 it is by the wire ingenia muffin 

00:05:49.549 --> 00:05:57.249
 support in which the meat attached to 

00:05:51.709 --> 00:05:57.249
 bone the golden mass to embrace says 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:05.800
 your fans will surely agree 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:07.750
 in the name and I miss them hear more than 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.530
 two days without creative space is not what 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.530
 same truth 

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:18.419
 it is good that it is well loaded 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.530
 slats not mantle soul believe in addition 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:23.349
 exactly look also I already says 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:25.360
 Trim cuts these flowers and already 

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:27.490
 we hit not as we have done in 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.080
 some other programs that we paste a 

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:31.389
 flower on another flower you can see them 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:34.270
 15 chapters so if we give you a 

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:36.849
 little bit of enhancement to the flower so that 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:39.340
 see this pre dimension as well as 

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:42.159
 our butterflies and then we're going to 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:44.289
 paste it we can use silicone without 

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:46.119
 problem 

00:06:44.289 --> 00:06:49.569
 at the height we want, you can start 

00:06:46.119 --> 00:06:53.199
 here one after taking one of the 

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:56.469
 three that this one is with also prima ti 

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:58.029
 but before I put it, I'm going to put 

00:06:56.469 --> 00:06:59.559
 have out of other option besides 

00:06:58.029 --> 00:07:02.319
 silicone can also use a tape 

00:06:59.559 --> 00:07:04.719
 duplexing and place nothing but 

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:06.669
 the ink the double-sided tape that has 

00:07:04.719 --> 00:07:11.050
 short duration then it may be that 

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:14.619
 is on top and we are putting the 

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:16.360
 this flowers by milan also of form 

00:07:14.619 --> 00:07:18.490
 irregular and let's also leave these 

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.559
 the rattle and cough 

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:22.180
 because what to despise are those who 

00:07:20.559 --> 00:07:24.309
 they are going to help us make our 

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:26.050
 mobile when they open the door and that 

00:07:24.309 --> 00:07:28.149
 It seems that while we think about more 

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:30.009
 ways to use this mobile we're going 

00:07:28.149 --> 00:07:33.180
 to see a commercial and we come back with more 

00:07:30.009 --> 00:07:33.180
 let's see it
