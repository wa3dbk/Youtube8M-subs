complex number remember the magnitude of
Z<00:01:03.449> for<00:01:03.809> instance<00:01:04.170> here<00:01:04.440> is<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.949> square<00:01:05.460> root

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
Z for instance here is the square root

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.180 
Z for instance here is the square root
of<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.390> two<00:01:06.740> components<00:01:08.360> squared<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.510> added

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
of the two components squared and added

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.040 
of the two components squared and added
so<00:01:11.190> that<00:01:11.220> rather<00:01:11.730> than<00:01:11.940> half<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.420> square<00:01:12.810> root

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.050 
so that rather than half a square root

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.840 
so that rather than half a square root
equal<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.500> square<00:01:13.860> root<00:01:14.070> or<00:01:14.220> just<00:01:14.580> square<00:01:14.820> both

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
equal a square root or just square both

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.600 
equal a square root or just square both
sides<00:01:15.060> so<00:01:15.930> when<00:01:16.110> I<00:01:16.140> put<00:01:16.409> down<00:01:16.620> square<00:01:17.250> tear

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
sides so when I put down square tear

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.190 
sides so when I put down square tear
that<00:01:18.120> doesn't<00:01:18.300> mean<00:01:18.390> anything<00:01:18.690> like<00:01:18.840> having<00:01:19.110> a

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
that doesn't mean anything like having a

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.960 
that doesn't mean anything like having a

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
bracket will be square the first square

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.060 
bracket will be square the first square
the<00:01:21.120> second<00:01:21.480> twice<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.780> product<00:01:22.070> squaring

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
the second twice the product squaring

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.610 
the second twice the product squaring
something<00:01:23.100> means<00:01:23.670> removing<00:01:24.660> that<00:01:24.930> square

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:25.620 
something means removing that square

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.340 
something means removing that square
root<00:01:26.150> so<00:01:27.150> that<00:01:27.300> what<00:01:27.510> we'll<00:01:27.690> have<00:01:27.720> here<00:01:27.900> would

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
root so that what we'll have here would

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.290 
root so that what we'll have here would
be<00:01:28.560> X<00:01:29.280> minus<00:01:29.520> 2<00:01:30.060> squared<00:01:30.620> plus<00:01:31.620> not<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.550> I<00:01:32.760> Y

be X minus 2 squared plus not the I Y

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.050 
be X minus 2 squared plus not the I Y
squared<00:01:33.780> just<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.920> coefficient<00:01:35.460> there<00:01:35.610> just

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
squared just the coefficient there just

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.920 
squared just the coefficient there just
Y<00:01:36.420> squared<00:01:36.480> would<00:01:37.410> equal<00:01:37.470> x<00:01:38.400> squared<00:01:38.670> plus<00:01:39.210> y

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
Y squared would equal x squared plus y

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.160 
Y squared would equal x squared plus y
plus<00:01:39.960> 1<00:01:40.800> squared<00:01:41.330> I've<00:01:42.330> said<00:01:42.570> you'll<00:01:42.720> bracket

I'd<00:02:05.670> rather<00:02:05.790> have<00:02:06.090> that<00:02:06.120> leading<00:02:06.780> coefficient

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
I'd rather have that leading coefficient

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.990 
I'd rather have that leading coefficient
is<00:02:07.440> a<00:02:07.470> positive<00:02:07.560> so<00:02:08.429> I'll<00:02:08.519> do<00:02:08.640> is<00:02:08.729> I'll<00:02:08.819> bring

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
is a positive so I'll do is I'll bring

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.460 
is a positive so I'll do is I'll bring
over<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.420> state<00:02:09.660> and<00:02:09.840> then<00:02:09.959> flip<00:02:10.229> all<00:02:10.379> the

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
over to the state and then flip all the

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.880 
over to the state and then flip all the
saints<00:02:10.830> so<00:02:11.160> I've<00:02:11.250> got<00:02:11.430> negative<00:02:11.640> 4x<00:02:12.440> I've<00:02:13.440> got

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
saints so I've got negative 4x I've got

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.559 
saints so I've got negative 4x I've got
a<00:02:13.920> minus<00:02:14.849> 2y

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
a minus 2y

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.059 
a minus 2y
I've<00:02:15.629> got<00:02:16.530> a<00:02:16.560> plus<00:02:17.040> 3<00:02:17.540> which<00:02:18.540> equals<00:02:18.690> 0<00:02:19.230> or<00:02:19.650> just

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
I've got a plus 3 which equals 0 or just

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.380 
I've got a plus 3 which equals 0 or just
simplifying<00:02:20.790> that<00:02:21.000> down<00:02:21.269> for<00:02:21.870> X<00:02:22.110> plus<00:02:22.950> 2y

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
simplifying that down for X plus 2y

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.260 
simplifying that down for X plus 2y
minus<00:02:24.390> 3<00:02:24.420> equals<00:02:25.290> 0<00:02:25.349> and

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
minus 3 equals 0 and

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.150

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
just state of course that it looks like

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:34.210 
just state of course that it looks like
that<00:02:28.310> so<00:02:28.760> /<00:02:28.970> we<00:02:29.150> note<00:02:29.390> in<00:02:30.050> the<00:02:30.410> form<00:02:30.740> e<00:02:31.480> x<00:02:32.480> +<00:02:33.260> B<00:02:33.560> y

that satisfy that equation and that

that satisfy that equation and that
equation<00:03:15.290> of<00:03:15.769> course<00:03:16.010> is<00:03:16.220> the<00:03:16.430> equation<00:03:16.849> of<00:03:16.940> a

so<00:03:18.080> the<00:03:18.200> locus<00:03:18.650> will<00:03:18.830> be<00:03:18.950> a<00:03:18.980> lane<00:03:19.660> the<00:03:20.660> locus<00:03:21.080> of

so the locus will be a lane the locus of

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:23.380 
so the locus will be a lane the locus of

well now get diagram just means like a

well now get diagram just means like a
court<00:03:25.340> in<00:03:25.519> the<00:03:25.580> diagram<00:03:26.120> you've<00:03:26.959> got<00:03:27.110> the<00:03:27.200> real

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
court in the diagram you've got the real

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:28.879 
axis you've got the imaginary axis

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:31.390 
axis you've got the imaginary axis
sometimes<00:03:29.660> you<00:03:29.810> call<00:03:29.989> that<00:03:30.200> real<00:03:30.650> imaginary

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
sometimes you call that real imaginary

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.650 
sometimes you call that real imaginary
like<00:03:32.360> this<00:03:32.569> real<00:03:33.290> and<00:03:33.910> imaginary<00:03:34.910> but<00:03:35.480> since

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
like this real and imaginary but since

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:36.819 
like this real and imaginary but since
it's<00:03:35.810> gone<00:03:35.930> to<00:03:36.049> the<00:03:36.140> trouble<00:03:36.290> of<00:03:36.440> seeing<00:03:36.680> the

it's gone to the trouble of seeing the

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:38.949 
it's gone to the trouble of seeing the

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
components of the complex numbers will

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:41.530 
components of the complex numbers will
be<00:03:39.079> made<00:03:39.260> up<00:03:39.410> of<00:03:39.530> x<00:03:39.769> and<00:03:39.980> y's<00:03:40.220> then<00:03:41.060> that<00:03:41.360> means

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
be made up of x and y's then that means

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.569 
be made up of x and y's then that means
I<00:03:41.630> could<00:03:41.750> call<00:03:42.019> that<00:03:42.049> part<00:03:42.620> Y<00:03:42.860> and<00:03:43.370> that

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:43.579 
I could call that part Y and that

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:46.170 
I could call that part Y and that
partakes<00:03:44.120> almost<00:03:45.019> like<00:03:45.110> an<00:03:45.200> audio<00:03:45.410> diagram

what<00:03:47.180> would<00:03:47.360> this<00:03:47.480> Lane<00:03:47.690> look<00:03:47.900> like<00:03:48.170> well<00:03:48.620> just

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
what would this Lane look like well just

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.100 
what would this Lane look like well just
go<00:03:49.220> back<00:03:49.400> up<00:03:49.579> to<00:03:49.819> some<00:03:50.269> jute<00:03:50.510> or<00:03:50.569> whatever<00:03:50.900> for

go back up to some jute or whatever for

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:52.990 
go back up to some jute or whatever for
this<00:03:51.230> more<00:03:51.440> if<00:03:51.500> you<00:03:51.590> got<00:03:51.739> I<00:03:52.069> want<00:03:52.519> to<00:03:52.760> think<00:03:52.970> but

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
this more if you got I want to think but

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.900 
this more if you got I want to think but
it<00:03:53.180> cuts<00:03:53.420> the<00:03:53.569> axis<00:03:53.599> so<00:03:54.530> when<00:03:55.010> the<00:03:55.129> y-axis<00:03:55.610> X

got<00:04:10.940> 4<00:04:11.269> X<00:04:11.510> would<00:04:11.870> be<00:04:11.900> 3<00:04:12.519> so<00:04:13.519> X<00:04:13.760> would<00:04:13.940> be<00:04:14.230> 3/4<00:04:15.230> so

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:16.099 
got 4 X would be 3 so X would be 3/4 so

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:17.440 
got 4 X would be 3 so X would be 3/4 so
that<00:04:16.280> would<00:04:16.400> just<00:04:16.430> be<00:04:16.700> quite<00:04:16.880> steep<00:04:17.150> that<00:04:17.180> be

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
that would just be quite steep that be

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.409 
that would just be quite steep that be
down<00:04:17.599> about<00:04:17.840> there<00:04:18.049> 3/4<00:04:19.030> so<00:04:20.030> the<00:04:20.120> line<00:04:20.269> I'm

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
down about there 3/4 so the line I'm

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:25.589 
down about there 3/4 so the line I'm
looking<00:04:20.720> for<00:04:20.959> would<00:04:21.200> be<00:04:21.229> something<00:04:21.739> like<00:04:21.919> this

00:04:25.589 --> 00:04:25.599 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:29.200 

that's<00:04:26.599> all<00:04:26.750> there<00:04:26.840> is<00:04:26.870> to<00:04:27.139> it
