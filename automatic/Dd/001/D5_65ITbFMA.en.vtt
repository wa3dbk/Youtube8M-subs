00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:11.000
 hi everyone guys are giving it 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:14.570
 welcome videos and greece schlans where you 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.320
 I will show a layout for a ball base 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:21.859
 7 really really good because it is 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:25.289
 very versatile both for resources for 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:28.230
 the do then has 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.539
 I immediately built it and I think that 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.500
 however the whole constitution part there 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:37.530
 speed because you know how then 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.949
 respect then see you when the 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.949
 beat 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:48.379
 sky 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.670
 lets him know 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.640
 and revenge 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.640
 Hello 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:12.390
 and music 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:36.110
 ok this guys base 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:38.420
 I invented myself and then I invented it 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.490
 let's start by saying it's a lot 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.770
 versatile just for ever I found myself 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:46.090
 that for the resources because it is enough to take 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:48.740
 the town hall and take it away and take it 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.680
 laboratory and while I was here in the center 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.180
 I can mythical and issue a town hall 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.780
 away or put it down here 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:59.560
 walls and also for this point it is a lot 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:03.790
 versatile for resources 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:06.340
 if you do not have the deposits almost full 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.069
 always those who find you alive destroy the 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.959
 town hall outside 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:13.620
 and then what we have put the king 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:15.840
 barbero here to worry about the cannon here 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.239
 because they have the same range of action 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.030
 so let's say they defend the same area 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.159
 and so I preferred to put it that way then 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:26.909
 we have in the various hours of the archer 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:27.900
 sorry around the village and a lot 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:29.849
 symmetric 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.350
 along with these others who have neither 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:36.610
 I advise you to put 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.780
 the guns or out because we say seen 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.170
 which could leave have a beam 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.600
 wider even being inside the walls 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.340
 cover almost the same area and its own 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.950
 it's not so it's better that way 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:52.330
 then we have these two air defenses that 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:55.780
 cover half of the village and then 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:58.090
 this mortar is a little isolated that you give from 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:02.230
 do that includes this whole area e 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.490
 we say it is spoken almost even by these 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:08.150
 to the mortars held above 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:09.650
 then we have these things here and which 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.110
 therefore, the project has two walls 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.849
 okay so let's start because of the clan 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:17.269
 which is very centered so not so 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:19.910
 I succeeded also because I had to do 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.400
 very centered I had to marry a little bit 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.320
 But it is fine and how 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.910
 concerns the traps then we have the 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.520
 snap traps that defend i 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.160
 fair guns of the giant bombs and vi 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.199
 I recommend putting giant bombs 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:36.169
 inside and not as I am doing 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:39.320
 now because initially I had in the other 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:41.360
 way and that is wrong because putting 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.310
 a barbarian even if it was on these 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.110
 positively passed for here and lively having 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.569
 fired the giant bomb so it's better 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:50.270
 that you put it more internal 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:53.899
 and the two heads instead are varied 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:57.039
 corners that go well are fine 

00:04:53.899 --> 00:05:00.289
 and while various external officers are fine 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:03.619
 lipari and va well i hope there is 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:09.879
 liked I remember to leave like and 

00:05:03.619 --> 00:05:09.879
 to comment and all
