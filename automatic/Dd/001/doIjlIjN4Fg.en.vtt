00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.049 
better quality I'm not shun percent sure
I<00:00:11.650> think<00:00:12.650> she's<00:00:12.830> just<00:00:13.040> kind<00:00:13.280> of<00:00:13.339> nervous<00:00:13.639> she's

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:14.059 
I think she's just kind of nervous she's

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:15.490 
I think she's just kind of nervous she's
a<00:00:14.089> stand<00:00:14.450> I<00:00:14.839> didn't<00:00:15.019> want<00:00:15.139> to<00:00:15.200> pull<00:00:15.349> her<00:00:15.440> out

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:15.500 
a stand I didn't want to pull her out

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.859 
a stand I didn't want to pull her out
she<00:00:15.919> looked<00:00:16.040> a<00:00:16.160> little<00:00:16.250> feisty<00:00:16.550> she's<00:00:17.060> warm<00:00:17.600> I

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:17.869

was<00:00:23.090> low<00:00:23.269> 80s<00:00:23.750> I<00:00:23.869> think<00:00:24.109> when<00:00:24.289> I<00:00:24.320> took<00:00:24.380> her<00:00:24.619> out

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:24.680 
was low 80s I think when I took her out

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.189 
was low 80s I think when I took her out
or<00:00:25.039> mid<00:00:25.220> 80s<00:00:25.550> was<00:00:25.880> pretty<00:00:26.179> damn<00:00:26.359> hot<00:00:26.660> and<00:00:27.050> it's

I<00:00:55.580> i<00:00:55.910> bought<00:00:56.980> the<00:00:57.980> rep<00:00:58.790> to<00:00:58.940> therm<00:00:59.150> which<00:00:59.420> as<00:00:59.660> far

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
I i bought the rep to therm which as far

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.120 
I i bought the rep to therm which as far
as<00:00:59.990> i<00:01:00.050> know<00:01:00.110> it<00:01:00.320> works<00:01:00.440> really<00:01:00.680> well<00:01:00.830> it's

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:01.130 
as i know it works really well it's

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.689 
as i know it works really well it's
pretty<00:01:01.610> cool<00:01:01.990> fairly<00:01:02.990> inexpensive<00:01:03.680> you<00:01:04.610> know
