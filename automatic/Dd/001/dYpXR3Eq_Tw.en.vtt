00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
realistic experience when they're

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.469 
realistic experience when they're

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.389 
driving and racing their vehicle another
key<00:01:48.720> advantage<00:01:49.140> is<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:49.530> can<00:01:49.680> run<00:01:49.829> as<00:01:50.070> long<00:01:50.280> as

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
key advantage is you can run as long as

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.219 
key advantage is you can run as long as
you<00:01:50.490> want<00:01:50.700> simply<00:01:51.270> by<00:01:51.420> adding<00:01:51.630> fuel<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.049> the

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
you want simply by adding fuel to the

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.380 
you want simply by adding fuel to the
fuel<00:01:52.500> tank<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.950> generally<00:01:53.729> they<00:01:53.880> are<00:01:53.909> faster

another<00:02:25.130> aspect<00:02:25.550> of<00:02:25.640> course<00:02:25.820> is<00:02:26.060> that<00:02:26.210> they

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
another aspect of course is that they

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.790 
another aspect of course is that they
have<00:02:26.390> higher<00:02:26.570> operating<00:02:27.020> costs<00:02:27.440> because<00:02:27.710> you

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
have higher operating costs because you

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.590 
have higher operating costs because you
have<00:02:27.890> to<00:02:28.010> do<00:02:28.190> do<00:02:28.550> have<00:02:28.700> to<00:02:28.820> keep<00:02:28.970> buying<00:02:29.180> fuel

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
have to do do have to keep buying fuel

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.690 
have to do do have to keep buying fuel
and<00:02:29.870> fuel<00:02:30.470> is<00:02:30.680> generally<00:02:31.070> at<00:02:31.130> thirty<00:02:31.310> five<00:02:31.520> to

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
and fuel is generally at thirty five to

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
and fuel is generally at thirty five to
forty<00:02:31.850> five<00:02:32.090> dollars<00:02:32.270> a<00:02:32.450> gallon<00:02:34.720> another

forty five dollars a gallon another

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.720 
forty five dollars a gallon another
aspect<00:02:36.200> is<00:02:36.290> that<00:02:36.350> RC<00:02:36.830> vehicle<00:02:37.160> generally<00:02:37.550> do

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
aspect is that RC vehicle generally do

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.610 
aspect is that RC vehicle generally do
not<00:02:37.760> have<00:02:38.330> reverse<00:02:38.750> although<00:02:39.320> this<00:02:39.440> is

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
not have reverse although this is

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.260 
not have reverse although this is
sometimes<00:02:39.830> available<00:02:40.460> to<00:02:40.520> higher-end<00:02:40.910> models

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
sometimes available to higher-end models

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.450 
sometimes available to higher-end models
another<00:02:42.110> aspect<00:02:42.590> is<00:02:42.710> that<00:02:42.860> you<00:02:42.950> cannot<00:02:43.100> use<00:02:43.190> it

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
another aspect is that you cannot use it

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.300 
another aspect is that you cannot use it
indoors<00:02:43.670> and<00:02:44.240> you<00:02:45.170> should<00:02:45.350> also<00:02:45.500> consider

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
indoors and you should also consider

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.610 
indoors and you should also consider
fact<00:02:47.030> that<00:02:47.300> nitro<00:02:47.570> fuel<00:02:47.840> may<00:02:47.990> be<00:02:48.050> difficult<00:02:48.590> to

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
fact that nitro fuel may be difficult to

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.230 
fact that nitro fuel may be difficult to
purchase<00:02:49.010> in<00:02:49.130> your<00:02:49.160> area<00:02:49.610> especially<00:02:49.910> if

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240 
purchase in your area especially if

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.120 
purchase in your area especially if
you're<00:02:50.360> located<00:02:50.750> far<00:02:50.990> away<00:02:51.020> from<00:02:51.320> any<00:02:51.680> RC

you're located far away from any RC
hobby<00:02:52.340> shops<00:02:52.700> now<00:02:53.390> let's<00:02:53.600> look<00:02:53.720> at<00:02:53.810> the<00:02:53.960> pros

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
hobby shops now let's look at the pros

from<00:02:57.020> pros<00:02:57.260> perspective<00:02:57.920> they<00:02:58.880> are<00:02:59.000> quiet<00:02:59.330> and

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
from pros perspective they are quiet and

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.940 
from pros perspective they are quiet and
should<00:02:59.720> not<00:02:59.870> disturb<00:03:00.260> your<00:03:00.470> neighbors<00:03:00.800> and

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
should not disturb your neighbors and

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.040 
should not disturb your neighbors and
can<00:03:01.100> be<00:03:01.220> used<00:03:01.430> by<00:03:01.580> seeing<00:03:01.820> all<00:03:02.000> RC<00:03:02.510> race<00:03:02.690> tracks

can be used by seeing all RC race tracks
they're<00:03:03.920> easier<00:03:04.280> to<00:03:04.400> use<00:03:04.550> them<00:03:04.730> and<00:03:04.850> chain<00:03:05.090> so

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
they're easier to use them and chain so

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:06.670 
they're easier to use them and chain so
they're<00:03:05.930> much<00:03:06.020> more<00:03:06.230> suited<00:03:06.470> for<00:03:06.500> the
