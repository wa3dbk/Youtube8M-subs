00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
bottom with a hacksaw this results in

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.779 
bottom with a hacksaw this results in
some<00:01:32.530> stunning<00:01:32.829> structures<00:01:33.520> it<00:01:33.700> would

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:33.789 
some stunning structures it would

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:35.879 
some stunning structures it would
otherwise<00:01:34.149> be<00:01:34.359> pretty<00:01:34.630> difficult<00:01:34.929> since<00:01:35.740> the

otherwise be pretty difficult since the

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:37.410 
otherwise be pretty difficult since the
bottom<00:01:36.069> is<00:01:36.310> flat<00:01:36.549> this<00:01:36.819> is<00:01:36.880> something<00:01:37.389> that

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
bottom is flat this is something that

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.389 
bottom is flat this is something that
can<00:01:37.659> even<00:01:37.840> be<00:01:37.960> silicone<00:01:38.530> directly<00:01:39.130> to<00:01:39.280> the
