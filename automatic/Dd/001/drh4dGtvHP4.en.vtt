00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.709 
really want it to be good all right it's
usually<00:00:31.230> been<00:00:31.769> on<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.009> weaker<00:00:32.399> side<00:00:33.270> of<00:00:33.480> decks

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
usually been on the weaker side of decks

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.290 
usually been on the weaker side of decks
are<00:00:34.380> just<00:00:34.770> because<00:00:35.070> of<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.610> prevalence<00:00:35.940> of

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
are just because of the prevalence of

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.220 
are just because of the prevalence of
like<00:00:36.800> buzzard<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.180> miracle<00:00:39.180> rogue<00:00:39.329> which

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
like buzzard and miracle rogue which

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.709 
like buzzard and miracle rogue which
it's<00:00:40.440> usually<00:00:40.739> week<00:00:40.890> against<00:00:41.309> but<00:00:44.539> right<00:00:45.539> now

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
it's usually week against but right now

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.180 
it's usually week against but right now
I<00:00:45.750> actually<00:00:46.020> think<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:46.559> shaman<00:00:47.100> is

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
I actually think that shaman is

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.799 
I actually think that shaman is
surprisingly<00:00:47.730> good<00:00:47.789> against<00:00:48.239> X<00:00:48.390> like<00:00:48.539> hunter

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
surprisingly good against X like hunter

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.959 
surprisingly good against X like hunter
so<00:00:49.110> I'm<00:00:49.890> just<00:00:50.070> going<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.280> keep<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.610> defender

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
so I'm just going to keep the defender

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.310 
so I'm just going to keep the defender
in<00:00:51.090> my<00:00:51.180> opening<00:00:51.329> hand<00:00:51.629> we're<00:00:51.899> plenty<00:00:52.140> we<00:00:52.199> can

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
in my opening hand we're plenty we can

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.420 
in my opening hand we're plenty we can
see<00:00:52.410> you're<00:00:52.500> playing<00:00:52.710> against<00:00:52.920> hunter<00:00:53.190> so<00:00:53.399> I

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
see you're playing against hunter so I

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.850 
see you're playing against hunter so I
have<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.730> early<00:00:53.879> game<00:00:54.350> removal<00:00:55.350> spells<00:00:55.620> to

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
have the early game removal spells to

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.860 
have the early game removal spells to
kind<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.100> help<00:00:56.190> control<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.579> board<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:56.940> bit<00:00:57.090> i'm

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
kind of help control the board a bit i'm

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.000 
kind of help control the board a bit i'm
going<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.109> keep<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.320> defender<00:00:58.680> though<00:00:58.770> just

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
going to keep the defender though just

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.799 
going to keep the defender though just
so<00:00:59.039> i<00:00:59.100> have<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.850> defender<00:01:00.390> is<00:01:00.449> one<00:01:00.539> of<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.690> best

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
so i have a defender is one of the best

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.479 
so i have a defender is one of the best
cards<00:01:01.079> against<00:01:01.260> hunter<00:01:01.500> in<00:01:01.680> my<00:01:01.710> experience<00:01:02.309> I

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
cards against hunter in my experience I

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.280 
cards against hunter in my experience I
could<00:01:02.850> look<00:01:03.090> for<00:01:03.270> like<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.750> drop<00:01:04.019> or<00:01:04.229> an

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
could look for like a to drop or an

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.590 
could look for like a to drop or an
unbound<00:01:04.589> all<00:01:04.739> mental<00:01:05.040> but<00:01:06.030> if<00:01:06.119> I<00:01:06.180> don't<00:01:06.240> see

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
unbound all mental but if I don't see

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.990 
unbound all mental but if I don't see
those<00:01:06.750> cards<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.430> we're<00:01:08.430> gonna<00:01:08.640> regret

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
those cards and we're gonna regret

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.450 
those cards and we're gonna regret
putting<00:01:09.270> back<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.510> defender<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:10.680> think<00:01:11.400> this

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
putting back the defender I think this

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.800 
putting back the defender I think this
card<00:01:11.700> is<00:01:11.790> one<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.030> most<00:01:12.090> important<00:01:12.570> cards

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
card is one of the most important cards

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.370 
card is one of the most important cards
against<00:01:13.020> hunter<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:13.560> I'll<00:01:13.680> keep<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.040> I<00:01:15.380> like

don't<00:02:02.960> want<00:02:03.229> to<00:02:03.290> see<00:02:03.440> like<00:02:03.680> bow<00:02:03.950> orly<00:02:04.640> och

don't want to see like bow orly och

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.910 
don't want to see like bow orly och
those<00:02:05.240> two<00:02:05.479> are<00:02:05.690> probably<00:02:06.200> the<00:02:06.350> best<00:02:06.560> plays<00:02:06.770> he

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
those two are probably the best plays he

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.070 
those two are probably the best plays he
could<00:02:07.039> have<00:02:07.190> Oh<00:02:10.360> much<00:02:11.360> better<00:02:11.390> at<00:02:11.750> hearthstone

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
could have Oh much better at hearthstone

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:26.190 
could have Oh much better at hearthstone
than<00:02:12.230> I<00:02:12.320> am<00:02:16.090> the<00:02:17.090> hunter's<00:02:17.420> mark<00:02:17.570> too<00:02:24.340> ok<00:02:25.340> well

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
than I am the hunter's mark too ok well

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.780 
than I am the hunter's mark too ok well
that<00:02:27.200> is<00:02:27.350> the<00:02:27.380> best<00:02:27.830> possible<00:02:28.040> turn<00:02:28.519> one<00:02:28.760> two

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
that is the best possible turn one two

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.000 
that is the best possible turn one two
and<00:02:29.209> three<00:02:29.570> they<00:02:29.810> could<00:02:30.080> have<00:02:30.170> had<00:02:30.350> in<00:02:30.890> the

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
and three they could have had in the

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.640 
and three they could have had in the
game<00:02:31.239> so<00:02:32.239> hopefully<00:02:32.450> his<00:02:32.840> draw<00:02:33.110> after<00:02:33.380> this

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
game so hopefully his draw after this

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:40.500 
game so hopefully his draw after this
point<00:02:33.920> is<00:02:34.180> not<00:02:35.180> as<00:02:35.330> good<00:02:35.510> we'll<00:02:36.500> see<00:02:36.709> though<00:02:36.920> I

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:42.580 

don't<00:02:41.510> think<00:02:41.630> I'm<00:02:41.690> gonna<00:02:41.750> be<00:02:41.930> attacking<00:02:42.410> into

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
don't think I'm gonna be attacking into

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:43.960 
don't think I'm gonna be attacking into
that<00:02:42.739> bow<00:02:42.950> until<00:02:43.310> I<00:02:43.340> have<00:02:43.489> a<00:02:43.519> lot<00:02:43.700> of<00:02:43.730> damage

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
that bow until I have a lot of damage

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.979 
that bow until I have a lot of damage
because<00:02:46.299> it<00:02:47.299> just<00:02:47.390> kind<00:02:47.600> of<00:02:47.630> gives<00:02:47.720> them<00:02:47.870> more

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
because it just kind of gives them more

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.080 
because it just kind of gives them more
charges<00:02:48.530> like<00:02:48.709> vitek<00:02:49.130> now<00:02:49.370> he<00:02:49.670> just<00:02:49.790> gets<00:02:50.000> a

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
charges like vitek now he just gets a

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.060 
charges like vitek now he just gets a
charge<00:02:50.360> to<00:02:50.450> kill<00:02:50.750> the<00:02:50.870> little<00:02:51.019> foot<00:02:54.040> do<00:02:55.040> a

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
charge to kill the little foot do a

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:02.110 
charge to kill the little foot do a
second<00:02:55.610> weapon<00:02:59.590> this<00:03:00.590> is<00:03:00.739> interesting<00:03:01.280> and

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
second weapon this is interesting and

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.820 
second weapon this is interesting and

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.320 

I<00:03:16.620> think<00:03:17.070> I'm<00:03:17.160> just<00:03:17.190> gonna<00:03:17.340> do<00:03:17.640> it<00:03:17.820> because

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
I think I'm just gonna do it because

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.500 
I think I'm just gonna do it because
this<00:03:18.600> has<00:03:18.750> charges<00:03:19.290> anyway<00:03:20.150> I'm<00:03:21.150> not<00:03:21.300> going<00:03:21.450> to

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
this has charges anyway I'm not going to

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.780 
this has charges anyway I'm not going to
defend<00:03:21.630> her<00:03:21.900> first<00:03:22.140> I'm<00:03:22.500> just<00:03:22.530> going<00:03:22.680> to<00:03:22.830> hop

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
defend her first I'm just going to hop

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.980 
defend her first I'm just going to hop
the<00:03:23.850> freezing<00:03:24.390> trap<00:03:24.480> with<00:03:24.750> us<00:03:24.870> right<00:03:25.020> now<00:03:25.080> I

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:26.990 
the freezing trap with us right now I

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.090 
the freezing trap with us right now I
should<00:03:27.990> always<00:03:28.230> assume<00:03:28.350> a<00:03:28.590> freezing<00:03:28.980> trap

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
should always assume a freezing trap

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.010 
should always assume a freezing trap
when<00:03:29.400> they<00:03:29.460> have<00:03:29.580> a<00:03:29.610> secret<00:03:29.880> like<00:03:30.510> one<00:03:30.780> hundred

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
when they have a secret like one hundred

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.660 
when they have a secret like one hundred
percent<00:03:31.050> of<00:03:31.320> the<00:03:31.380> time<00:03:31.470> and<00:03:32.310> I'm<00:03:32.400> just<00:03:32.520> going

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
percent of the time and I'm just going

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.190 
percent of the time and I'm just going
to<00:03:32.700> go<00:03:32.820> ahead<00:03:32.910> and<00:03:33.000> hero<00:03:33.300> power<00:03:33.570> here<00:03:33.930> this

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
to go ahead and hero power here this

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.110 
to go ahead and hero power here this
thing<00:03:34.380> that<00:03:34.530> will<00:03:34.620> guarantee<00:03:34.910> spell<00:03:35.910> damage

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
thing that will guarantee spell damage

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.330 
thing that will guarantee spell damage
when<00:03:36.420> I<00:03:36.450> need<00:03:36.690> it<00:03:36.720> so<00:03:37.410> for<00:03:37.740> now<00:03:37.770> I'll<00:03:38.040> just<00:03:38.100> do

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
when I need it so for now I'll just do

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.520 
when I need it so for now I'll just do
this<00:03:41.240> we<00:03:42.240> got<00:03:42.390> double<00:03:42.690> small<00:03:42.930> damage<00:03:43.140> if<00:03:43.410> we

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
this we got double small damage if we

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:50.110 
this we got double small damage if we
want<00:03:43.710> it<00:03:43.860> which<00:03:44.130> is<00:03:44.280> kind<00:03:44.430> of<00:03:44.520> cool<00:03:44.580> I<00:03:44.730> guess

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:04:01.870 

okay<00:03:53.570> blood<00:03:54.570> culture<00:03:55.080> that's<00:03:55.410> interesting<00:03:56.190> I

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:01.880 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.070 

guess<00:04:02.880> I'm<00:04:03.000> just<00:04:03.060> gonna<00:04:03.210> do<00:04:03.390> this<00:04:03.570> so<00:04:03.900> that<00:04:03.930> I

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
guess I'm just gonna do this so that I

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.620 
guess I'm just gonna do this so that I
have<00:04:04.260> a<00:04:04.290> threat<00:04:04.590> in<00:04:04.830> play<00:04:05.120> and<00:04:06.120> it's<00:04:06.270> you<00:04:06.510> know

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
have a threat in play and it's you know

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.070 
have a threat in play and it's you know
it's<00:04:06.660> on<00:04:06.870> curve<00:04:07.170> it's<00:04:08.160> good<00:04:08.480> that's<00:04:09.480> back<00:04:09.720> our

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
it's on curve it's good that's back our

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.720 
it's on curve it's good that's back our
actually<00:04:10.500> are<00:04:10.590> presenting<00:04:10.950> some<00:04:11.100> damage<00:04:11.520> so

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
actually are presenting some damage so

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.430 
actually are presenting some damage so
it's<00:04:11.910> really<00:04:12.060> important<00:04:14.900> the<00:04:15.900> problem<00:04:16.290> is

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
it's really important the problem is

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.140 
it's really important the problem is
that<00:04:16.470> bow<00:04:16.799> is<00:04:17.010> just<00:04:17.190> going<00:04:17.340> to<00:04:17.400> be<00:04:17.730> doing<00:04:17.910> a<00:04:18.090> lot

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
that bow is just going to be doing a lot

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.120 
that bow is just going to be doing a lot
of<00:04:18.239> work<00:04:18.450> forms<00:04:18.959> so<00:04:19.170> hopefully<00:04:19.560> he<00:04:19.680> walks<00:04:19.859> in<00:04:20.070> a

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
of work forms so hopefully he walks in a

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.909 
of work forms so hopefully he walks in a
lightning<00:04:20.310> storm<00:04:21.350> okay<00:04:22.350> you<00:04:22.410> didn't<00:04:22.740> really

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
lightning storm okay you didn't really

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:30.080 
lightning storm okay you didn't really
walk<00:04:23.340> into<00:04:23.669> it<00:04:23.790> too<00:04:23.940> hard<00:04:24.120> unfortunately

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.939 

so<00:04:31.090> I<00:04:31.120> got<00:04:31.270> some<00:04:31.419> options<00:04:31.599> I<00:04:32.139> can<00:04:32.620> lightning

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:32.949 
so I got some options I can lightning

lightning storm here with unbound rather

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:52.260 
lightning storm here with unbound rather
than<00:04:48.159> with<00:04:48.370> the<00:04:49.000> fenders<00:04:50.849> I've<00:04:51.849> got<00:04:52.060> some

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
than with the fenders I've got some

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.270 
than with the fenders I've got some
pressure<00:04:52.539> back<00:04:52.870> on<00:04:52.900> him<00:04:53.319> I<00:04:53.560> can't<00:04:53.889> really<00:04:54.009> play

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
pressure back on him I can't really play

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.939 
pressure back on him I can't really play
a<00:04:54.310> card<00:04:54.550> like<00:04:54.729> Jaime<00:04:54.970> never<00:04:55.680> you<00:04:56.680> can<00:04:56.800> see<00:04:56.919> I

00:04:56.939 --> 00:04:56.949 
a card like Jaime never you can see I

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:58.559 
a card like Jaime never you can see I
kept<00:04:57.280> the<00:04:57.400> defender<00:04:57.789> in<00:04:57.879> my<00:04:57.970> opening<00:04:58.120> hand<00:04:58.389> but

00:04:58.559 --> 00:04:58.569 
kept the defender in my opening hand but

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:00.779 
kept the defender in my opening hand but
i<00:04:58.599> still<00:04:58.780> haven't<00:04:59.020> played<00:04:59.259> it<00:04:59.409> it's<00:05:00.009> still<00:05:00.400> I

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:00.789 
i still haven't played it it's still I

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:02.999 
i still haven't played it it's still I
still<00:05:01.629> think<00:05:01.960> it<00:05:02.050> was<00:05:02.139> right<00:05:02.259> to<00:05:02.319> keep<00:05:02.620> it<00:05:02.830> like

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:03.009 
still think it was right to keep it like

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:04.770 
still think it was right to keep it like
it's<00:05:03.190> still<00:05:03.430> that<00:05:03.759> important<00:05:04.300> to<00:05:04.389> have<00:05:04.509> it<00:05:04.690> at

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
it's still that important to have it at

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.480 
it's still that important to have it at
some<00:05:04.990> point<00:05:05.020> in<00:05:05.319> the<00:05:05.380> game<00:05:05.409> if<00:05:05.979> I<00:05:06.039> didn't<00:05:06.340> keep

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
some point in the game if I didn't keep

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:07.890 
some point in the game if I didn't keep
it<00:05:06.669> i<00:05:06.759> might<00:05:06.880> just<00:05:06.940> never<00:05:07.240> draw<00:05:07.539> it<00:05:07.659> and<00:05:07.780> I'll

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
it i might just never draw it and I'll

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:14.820 
it i might just never draw it and I'll
be<00:05:08.050> really<00:05:08.110> awkward<00:05:13.199> he's<00:05:14.199> shown<00:05:14.409> me<00:05:14.440> sludge

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:14.830 
be really awkward he's shown me sludge

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.040 
be really awkward he's shown me sludge
Belcher<00:05:15.250> so<00:05:15.430> that<00:05:15.580> means<00:05:15.819> very<00:05:16.630> likely<00:05:16.870> to

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
Belcher so that means very likely to

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.930 
Belcher so that means very likely to
play<00:05:17.259> snake<00:05:17.590> trap<00:05:17.919> I<00:05:18.220> might<00:05:18.580> have<00:05:18.699> to<00:05:18.729> play

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
play snake trap I might have to play

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.170 
play snake trap I might have to play
around<00:05:19.090> that<00:05:19.330> card<00:05:19.539> at<00:05:19.659> some<00:05:19.840> point<00:05:21.180> they're

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 
around that card at some point they're

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:29.339 
around that card at some point they're
just<00:05:22.330> going<00:05:22.479> face<00:05:24.150> mmm<00:05:25.770> ok<00:05:26.770> I<00:05:26.800> won't<00:05:28.349> didn't

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:29.349 
just going face mmm ok I won't didn't

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:37.260 
just going face mmm ok I won't didn't
want<00:05:29.500> to<00:05:29.590> see<00:05:29.740> that

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:48.810 

I<00:05:46.350> mean<00:05:47.350> I'll<00:05:47.530> clear<00:05:48.160> this<00:05:48.340> stuff<00:05:48.610> off<00:05:48.790> the

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:52.030 
board but it's a little scary because he

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:54.470 
board but it's a little scary because he
can<00:05:52.150> still<00:05:52.390> tap<00:05:52.600> his<00:05:52.870> life<00:05:53.080> energy<00:05:53.440> on<00:05:53.560> to

good matchup 400 some versions of shaman
that<00:07:15.070> are<00:07:15.160> like<00:07:15.280> slower<00:07:15.640> they<00:07:16.000> play<00:07:16.240> lava

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:16.480

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:17.980 
burst and stuff those actually gonna

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:20.190

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:20.200 
have a harder time against aggro because

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.220 
have a harder time against aggro because
you<00:07:20.350> don't<00:07:20.500> play<00:07:20.740> as<00:07:21.040> many<00:07:21.190> fast<00:07:21.550> cards<00:07:22.230> and

you don't play as many fast cards and

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:24.540 
you don't play as many fast cards and
you<00:07:23.440> can't<00:07:23.650> really<00:07:23.740> play<00:07:23.950> cards<00:07:24.250> like<00:07:24.370> lava

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:24.550 
you can't really play cards like lava

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:26.850 
you can't really play cards like lava
