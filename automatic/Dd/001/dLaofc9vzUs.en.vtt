00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.670
 we continue with the special coverage and 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.170
 as a team about the winter storm that 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.179
 we have been anticipating for 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.100
 several days or modes again with my 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.710
 compañero rafael enríquez that has us 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.540
 more information about rafael 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.010
 we know that the greatest enemy of 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.000
 who we drive with this climate is the 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.000
 called black ice 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.230
 Juan Carlos so I can input 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:27.980
 tell them that this invisible enemy 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.480
 charges 250 thousand accidents annually 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.430
 we have below some 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.430
 recommendations to prevent accidents 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.449
 these are the images that are common 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.920
 during winter storms the cause 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:41.940
 is the so-called black ice that is 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.440
 just a layer of ice 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.149
 transparent that is formed in the 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.250
 pavement when the temperature of the 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.260
 soil is colder than the temperature of the 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.089
 environment tonight employees of the 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.489
 colorado transportation department 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:55.440
 will use solid antifreeze as the 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.299
 liquid will not be as effective due to 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.100
 the low temperatures that are expected 

00:00:57.299 --> 00:01:01.440
 they will first use chloride 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.940
 effective magnesium on the pavement with 16 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.280
 degrees fahrenheit temperature 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.050
 as they pass the night they will use 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.240
 sodium chloride to melt the ice 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.369
 black according to experts only goes up 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.960
 a temperature of 26 degrees fahrenheit 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.420
 so that the black ice is formed in the 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.069
 pavement immediately another indicator of 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.090
 the presence of black ice occurs when 

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:20.399
 you try to use the liquid 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.560
 wipers but it does not come out or it 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:24.600
 freezes quickly remember that the 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.819
 transit through bridges tunnels or steps to 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.530
 unevenness areas that by not receiving the 

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:30.869
 sunlight have floors more 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.000
 cold generating ideal conditions for 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.920
 the icing as always the 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.060
 caution and common sense could 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.060
 avoid accidents 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.170
 with the low temperatures that we expect 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.180
 tonight we will have frozen roads 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.130
 we recommend drivers to drive 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:50.080
 Slowly leave enough distance 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.369
 between vehicles and also give the right 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.369
 of track to our mechanical shovels 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.700
 do not forget that when there is black ice 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.950
 you will need twice as long as 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.330
 used to curb the information that 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.130
 we have so far a lot 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.020
 caution and we now return to the 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.840
 studios in denver with juan carlos 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.430
 thank you very much to my friend rafael 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.790
 Enriquez with those important 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.790
 recommendations
