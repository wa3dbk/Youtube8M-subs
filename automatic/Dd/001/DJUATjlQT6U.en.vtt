00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
reason why I made this channel is

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.369 
reason why I made this channel is
because<00:00:14.730> it's<00:00:14.910> like<00:00:15.089> on<00:00:15.330> my<00:00:15.540> channel<00:00:16.080> I<00:00:16.199> had

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
because it's like on my channel I had

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.109 
because it's like on my channel I had
one<00:00:16.590> three<00:00:16.800> three<00:00:17.010> seven<00:00:17.160> DFS<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:17.730> four<00:00:17.970> four

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
one three three seven DFS a four four

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.500 
one three three seven DFS a four four
four<00:00:18.359> I<00:00:18.630> had<00:00:19.410> one<00:00:19.770> copyright<00:00:20.369> strike<00:00:21.029> on<00:00:21.300> my

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
account and I I really think it was dumb

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.070 
account and I I really think it was dumb
because<00:00:26.310> it<00:00:26.730> was<00:00:26.849> from<00:00:27.090> when<00:00:27.240> I<00:00:27.269> made<00:00:27.480> bat<00:00:27.810> went

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
because it was from when I made bat went

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.630 
because it was from when I made bat went
back<00:00:28.289> when<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:28.560> made<00:00:28.710> arson<00:00:29.099> bees<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:29.519> it
