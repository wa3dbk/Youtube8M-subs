Tycho crater on on Google Earth you can

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.759 
Tycho crater on on Google Earth you can
see<00:00:23.490> it<00:00:23.640> now<00:00:24.119> this<00:00:24.420> is<00:00:24.570> from<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.779> JAXA<00:00:25.560> saline

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:27.769 
see it now this is from the JAXA saline

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:30.470 
see it now this is from the JAXA saline
you<00:00:28.769> know<00:00:28.890> spacecraft<00:00:29.460> that<00:00:29.640> Japan<00:00:30.000> has<00:00:30.269> out

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
you know spacecraft that Japan has out

you know spacecraft that Japan has out
there<00:00:30.510> now<00:00:30.869> in<00:00:31.109> rocks<00:00:31.439> it's<00:00:31.769> so<00:00:31.920> beautiful<00:00:32.369> it

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
there now in rocks it's so beautiful it

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.040 
there now in rocks it's so beautiful it
gets<00:00:32.610> some<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:32.850> the<00:00:32.940> best<00:00:33.180> high<00:00:33.360> resolution

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
gets some of the best high resolution

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.430 
gets some of the best high resolution
like<00:00:35.270> topography<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.660> we<00:00:36.809> know<00:00:36.930> everything

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
like topography and we know everything

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.590 
like topography and we know everything
that's<00:00:37.620> there<00:00:37.710> what<00:00:38.399> what<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.239> know<00:00:39.360> put

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
don't like using Google Earth for doing

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.650 
don't like using Google Earth for doing
stuff<00:00:46.110> like<00:00:46.230> this<00:00:46.350> just<00:00:47.070> because<00:00:47.520> it's<00:00:48.030> you

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
stuff like this just because it's you

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
know it's Google Earth you know anything

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.760 
know it's Google Earth you know anything
that<00:00:50.579> here<00:00:51.000> is<00:00:51.239> most<00:00:51.480> likely<00:00:51.660> been<00:00:52.020> looked<00:00:52.559> at

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
that here is most likely been looked at

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.490 
that here is most likely been looked at
but<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.879> me<00:00:54.059> these<00:00:54.270> just<00:00:54.480> look<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.809> rectangular

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
but to me these just look to rectangular

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.470 
but to me these just look to rectangular
buildings<00:00:56.160> it's<00:00:56.640> such<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:56.879> high-resolution

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
buildings it's such a high-resolution

know<00:03:13.489> let's<00:03:14.269> check<00:03:14.360> this<00:03:14.660> one<00:03:14.720> out<00:03:14.900> see<00:03:15.290> how<00:03:15.440> it

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
know let's check this one out see how it

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.430 
know let's check this one out see how it
alignment<00:03:16.250> is<00:03:16.370> there's<00:03:16.940> there<00:03:17.390> it<00:03:17.450> is<00:03:17.570> almost

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
alignment is there's there it is almost

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.970 
alignment is there's there it is almost
180<00:03:19.100> degrees<00:03:19.549> yes<00:03:19.880> it's<00:03:20.120> not<00:03:20.269> exactly<00:03:20.980> well

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
180 degrees yes it's not exactly well

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.059 
180 degrees yes it's not exactly well
yeah<00:03:22.340> it's

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
yeah it's

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:26.160 
yeah it's
pretty<00:03:24.670> much<00:03:24.819> north/south<00:03:25.390> aligned<00:03:25.750> so

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
pretty much north/south aligned so

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.080 
pretty much north/south aligned so
that's<00:03:26.319> pretty<00:03:26.500> interesting<00:03:26.879> and<00:03:27.879> then<00:03:28.000> we

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
that's pretty interesting and then we

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.399 
that's pretty interesting and then we
have<00:03:28.239> a<00:03:28.269> lot<00:03:28.569> of<00:03:28.719> these<00:03:28.810> little<00:03:29.140> square

00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:29.409 
have a lot of these little square

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:30.869 
have a lot of these little square
buildings<00:03:29.829> you<00:03:30.099> know<00:03:30.219> like<00:03:30.459> they're<00:03:30.670> either

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:30.879 
buildings you know like they're either

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:33.179 
buildings you know like they're either
cutting<00:03:31.359> into<00:03:31.599> the<00:03:31.689> land<00:03:31.900> here<00:03:32.409> like<00:03:33.040> right

00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:33.189 
cutting into the land here like right

00:03:33.189 --> 00:03:35.369 
cutting into the land here like right
here<00:03:33.430> like<00:03:33.670> there<00:03:33.819> certain<00:03:34.420> materials<00:03:35.049> or

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:35.379 
here like there certain materials or

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:38.339 
here like there certain materials or
just<00:03:35.799> totally<00:03:36.340> build<00:03:36.609> up<00:03:36.819> I<00:03:37.030> mean<00:03:37.299> I<00:03:37.540> want<00:03:38.260> you

guys to go ahead put this in and go

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.640 
guys to go ahead put this in and go
check<00:03:40.420> it<00:03:40.540> out<00:03:40.689> and<00:03:40.870> see<00:03:41.019> what<00:03:41.109> you<00:03:41.200> guys<00:03:41.319> think

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.440 
check it out and see what you guys think
the<00:03:42.189> whole<00:03:42.370> area<00:03:42.819> is<00:03:42.879> just<00:03:42.970> very<00:03:43.209> interesting

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
the whole area is just very interesting

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.080 
the whole area is just very interesting
let<00:03:44.349> me<00:03:44.439> see<00:03:44.590> if<00:03:44.680> I<00:03:44.739> can<00:03:44.890> tweak<00:03:45.519> it<00:03:45.640> to<00:03:45.760> the<00:03:45.849> side

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
let me see if I can tweak it to the side

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.929 
let me see if I can tweak it to the side
a<00:03:46.120> little<00:03:46.209> bit<00:03:47.400> and<00:03:48.400> like<00:03:48.459> I<00:03:48.549> said<00:03:48.700> this<00:03:48.760> was

00:03:48.929 --> 00:03:48.939 
a little bit and like I said this was

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:51.869 
a little bit and like I said this was
taken<00:03:49.239> by<00:03:49.269> the<00:03:49.420> JAXA<00:03:50.370> like<00:03:51.370> I<00:03:51.430> think<00:03:51.489> that's<00:03:51.790> a

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:51.879 
taken by the JAXA like I think that's a

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:53.369 
taken by the JAXA like I think that's a
pretty<00:03:52.090> big<00:03:52.269> building<00:03:52.659> I<00:03:52.750> think<00:03:52.840> I'm<00:03:53.200> not<00:03:53.319> sure

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:53.379 
pretty big building I think I'm not sure

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:55.470 
pretty big building I think I'm not sure
why<00:03:53.769> we<00:03:53.950> got<00:03:54.099> that<00:03:54.129> that<00:03:54.730> little<00:03:54.969> look<00:03:55.150> to<00:03:55.180> it

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
why we got that that little look to it

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.330 
why we got that that little look to it
but<00:03:55.719> over<00:03:56.379> here<00:03:56.560> on<00:03:56.620> the<00:03:56.799> side<00:03:57.010> of<00:03:57.220> it<00:03:57.310> there

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
but over here on the side of it there

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.009 
but over here on the side of it there
was<00:03:57.579> some<00:03:57.760> interesting<00:03:58.269> stuff<00:03:58.750> too<00:03:58.989> though

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
was some interesting stuff too though

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:00.869 
was some interesting stuff too though
look<00:03:59.829> like<00:04:00.010> there's<00:04:00.189> a<00:04:00.250> lot<00:04:00.400> of<00:04:00.489> symmetry

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:00.879 
look like there's a lot of symmetry

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:03.149 
look like there's a lot of symmetry
there<00:04:01.090> so<00:04:01.689> check<00:04:02.169> it<00:04:02.290> out<00:04:02.379> guys<00:04:02.620> see<00:04:02.950> what<00:04:03.069> you

00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:03.159 
there so check it out guys see what you

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:05.580 
there so check it out guys see what you
think<00:04:03.489> it's<00:04:04.239> that<00:04:04.419> psycho<00:04:04.629> crater<00:04:05.019> it's<00:04:05.319> one

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
think it's that psycho crater it's one

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.140 
think it's that psycho crater it's one
of<00:04:05.650> the<00:04:05.709> biggest<00:04:05.919> that<00:04:06.250> we<00:04:06.340> see<00:04:06.519> it's<00:04:06.669> one<00:04:07.060> of

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
of the biggest that we see it's one of

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.819 
of the biggest that we see it's one of
the<00:04:07.209> nicest<00:04:07.629> the<00:04:07.750> coolest<00:04:08.200> there's<00:04:08.470> a<00:04:08.530> lot<00:04:08.680> of

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:08.829 
the nicest the coolest there's a lot of

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:10.559 
the nicest the coolest there's a lot of
stuff<00:04:09.040> there<00:04:09.280> like<00:04:09.879> I<00:04:09.970> said<00:04:10.120> if<00:04:10.209> you<00:04:10.299> just<00:04:10.329> go

stuff there like I said if you just go

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:13.080 
stuff there like I said if you just go
type<00:04:10.840> in<00:04:11.129> Tycho<00:04:12.129> crater<00:04:12.310> anomalies<00:04:13.000> you're

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
type in Tycho crater anomalies you're

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:14.339 
type in Tycho crater anomalies you're
gonna<00:04:13.180> find<00:04:13.389> an<00:04:13.480> awful<00:04:13.750> lot<00:04:13.840> of<00:04:13.870> stuff<00:04:14.049> about

where we are here we got here they are

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:44.460 
where we are here we got here they are
and<00:04:38.039> I<00:04:41.070> got<00:04:42.070> centimeters<00:04:42.699> two<00:04:42.880> feet<00:04:43.229> 200<00:04:44.229> feet

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
and I got centimeters two feet 200 feet

and I got centimeters two feet 200 feet
let's<00:04:44.800> do<00:04:44.979> meters<00:04:45.340> for<00:04:45.610> my<00:04:46.030> friends<00:04:46.419> overseas

00:04:47.089 --> 00:04:47.099 
let's do meters for my friends overseas

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:51.149 
let's do meters for my friends overseas
66<00:04:48.099> meters<00:04:48.490> and<00:04:48.970> it<00:04:49.840> is<00:04:49.990> almost<00:04:50.349> 90s<00:04:50.830> the<00:04:51.039> way

00:04:51.149 --> 00:04:51.159 
66 meters and it is almost 90s the way

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:54.689 
66 meters and it is almost 90s the way
I've<00:04:51.280> got<00:04:51.490> it<00:04:51.669> here<00:04:51.909> it<00:04:52.090> is<00:04:52.409> aligned<00:04:53.409> so<00:04:54.370> it's

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:54.699 
I've got it here it is aligned so it's

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:57.149 
I've got it here it is aligned so it's
