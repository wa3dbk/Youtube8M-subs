fishing course here in Idaho you're only
allowed<00:00:12.900> to<00:00:13.139> bow<00:00:13.349> fish<00:00:13.709> for<00:00:14.070> non-game<00:00:14.879> species

allowed to bow fish for non-game species

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:18.500 
allowed to bow fish for non-game species
but<00:00:15.959> carp<00:00:16.740> are<00:00:17.039> most<00:00:17.310> certainly<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.850> non-game

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
but carp are most certainly a non-game

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.570 
but carp are most certainly a non-game
species<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.320> that's<00:00:19.440> mostly<00:00:19.860> what<00:00:20.070> we<00:00:20.190> expect

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
species and that's mostly what we expect

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.600 
species and that's mostly what we expect
to<00:00:20.670> find<00:00:20.730> here<00:00:21.350> the<00:00:22.350> plan<00:00:22.650> is<00:00:22.980> pretty<00:00:23.220> much<00:00:23.370> to

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:23.610 
to find here the plan is pretty much to

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.940 
to find here the plan is pretty much to
walk<00:00:23.850> along<00:00:24.270> the<00:00:24.600> cliffs<00:00:25.170> on<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.500> edge<00:00:25.710> of<00:00:25.860> the

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:25.950 
walk along the cliffs on the edge of the

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.560 
walk along the cliffs on the edge of the
river<00:00:26.130> which<00:00:26.850> will<00:00:27.000> give<00:00:27.150> us<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.360> good<00:00:27.540> view

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
river which will give us a good view

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.570 
river which will give us a good view
down<00:00:28.140> into<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.470> water<00:00:28.620> until<00:00:29.130> we<00:00:29.220> can<00:00:29.370> see

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
down into the water until we can see

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.760 
down into the water until we can see
some<00:00:29.790> fish<00:00:30.030> down<00:00:30.270> there<00:00:30.380> and<00:00:31.380> then<00:00:31.500> make<00:00:31.740> our

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:31.770 
some fish down there and then make our

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.069 
some fish down there and then make our
way<00:00:31.920> down<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.489> water<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:32.820> see<00:00:33.690> if<00:00:33.780> we<00:00:33.899> can

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
way down to the water and see if we can

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.030 
way down to the water and see if we can
hit<00:00:34.230> one<00:00:35.360> here<00:00:36.360> I've<00:00:36.540> got<00:00:36.720> an<00:00:36.870> old<00:00:37.110> compound

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
hit one here I've got an old compound

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.280 
hit one here I've got an old compound
Bowl<00:00:38.280> that<00:00:38.490> I<00:00:38.550> picked<00:00:38.790> up<00:00:38.940> on<00:00:39.150> ebay<00:00:39.840> for<00:00:39.900> about

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
Bowl that I picked up on ebay for about

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.220 
Bowl that I picked up on ebay for about
$35<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.280> number<00:00:41.640> of<00:00:41.760> years<00:00:41.970> ago<00:00:42.270> made<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:42.960> little

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
$35 a number of years ago made a little

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.810 
$35 a number of years ago made a little
jig<00:00:43.530> here<00:00:43.800> so<00:00:43.920> I<00:00:44.010> could<00:00:44.160> mount<00:00:44.280> a<00:00:44.460> spinning

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
jig here so I could mount a spinning

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.670 
jig here so I could mount a spinning
reel<00:00:45.000> on<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:45.600> then<00:00:46.079> these<00:00:46.200> arrows<00:00:46.560> are

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
reel on it and then these arrows are

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.920 
reel on it and then these arrows are
also<00:00:46.860> homemade<00:00:47.430> it's<00:00:47.640> just<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:48.000> solid<00:00:48.570> quarter

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
also homemade it's just a solid quarter

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.069 
also homemade it's just a solid quarter
inch<00:00:49.170> aluminum<00:00:49.350> bar<00:00:49.980> for<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.399> shaft<00:00:50.960> you<00:00:51.960> know

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
inch aluminum bar for a shaft you know

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.720 
inch aluminum bar for a shaft you know
with<00:00:52.260> some<00:00:52.410> standard<00:00:52.649> fletching<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.489> knock

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
with some standard fletching and a knock

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.440 
with some standard fletching and a knock
and<00:00:54.770> custom<00:00:55.770> homemade<00:00:56.430> fishing<00:00:56.910> head<00:00:57.149> that

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:57.450 
and custom homemade fishing head that

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.740 
and custom homemade fishing head that
seems<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.989> work<00:00:58.020> fairly<00:00:58.380> well<00:00:59.329> so<00:01:00.329> if<00:01:00.450> you<00:01:00.600> can

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
seems to work fairly well so if you can

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.740 
seems to work fairly well so if you can
see<00:01:01.020> in<00:01:01.290> that<00:01:01.440> slow<00:01:01.860> water<00:01:02.250> down<00:01:02.820> there<00:01:03.120> yeah

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
see in that slow water down there yeah

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.070 
see in that slow water down there yeah
those<00:01:04.589> dark<00:01:05.129> shadows<00:01:05.700> those<00:01:06.540> are<00:01:06.720> some<00:01:06.900> big

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
those dark shadows those are some big

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.940 
those dark shadows those are some big
carp<00:01:08.180> so<00:01:09.180> we're<00:01:09.360> gonna<00:01:09.479> see<00:01:10.080> if<00:01:10.170> we<00:01:10.200> can<00:01:10.530> work

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
carp so we're gonna see if we can work

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.770 
carp so we're gonna see if we can work
our<00:01:11.190> way<00:01:11.340> down<00:01:11.370> there<00:01:11.820> without<00:01:12.090> spooking<00:01:12.450> them

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
our way down there without spooking them

00:01:12.780 --> 00:02:01.680 
our way down there without spooking them
and<00:01:12.990> get<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.229> shot<00:01:13.500> at<00:01:13.650> one

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:26.280 

I<00:02:01.780> got<00:02:02.410> one

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.100 

we've<00:02:27.280> got<00:02:27.430> relatively<00:02:27.879> white<00:02:28.209> line<00:02:28.540> on<00:02:28.840> so

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
we've got relatively white line on so

really<00:02:36.519> see<00:02:36.670> the<00:02:36.790> fish<00:02:36.970> but<00:02:37.180> you<00:02:37.209> can<00:02:37.360> see<00:02:37.510> the

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:37.629 
really see the fish but you can see the

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:56.740 
really see the fish but you can see the
arrow<00:02:37.810> out<00:02:38.049> there

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:36.959 

yeah

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:36.969 

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:39.849 

well<00:03:37.969> not<00:03:38.150> necessarily<00:03:38.299> here<00:03:39.079> just<00:03:39.379> Blackfoot

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:39.859 
well not necessarily here just Blackfoot

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:42.309 
well not necessarily here just Blackfoot
River<00:03:39.890> carp<00:03:40.459> go<00:03:40.730> but<00:03:41.569> definitely<00:03:41.959> not<00:03:42.109> a<00:03:42.140> bad

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 
River carp go but definitely not a bad

00:03:42.319 --> 00:05:02.380 
River carp go but definitely not a bad
catch

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:02.390 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.120 

well<00:05:03.390> the<00:05:03.570> wind<00:05:03.810> is<00:05:03.990> coming<00:05:04.170> up<00:05:04.500> and<00:05:04.800> the

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
well the wind is coming up and the

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.860 
well the wind is coming up and the
ripples<00:05:05.610> that<00:05:05.760> it<00:05:05.910> makes<00:05:06.090> on<00:05:06.210> the<00:05:06.270> water<00:05:06.540> make

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
ripples that it makes on the water make

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.230 
ripples that it makes on the water make
the<00:05:07.020> fish<00:05:07.230> hard<00:05:07.470> to<00:05:07.620> see<00:05:07.800> so<00:05:08.190> we're<00:05:08.700> calling<00:05:08.910> it

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
the fish hard to see so we're calling it

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.870 
the fish hard to see so we're calling it
a<00:05:09.330> day<00:05:09.510> and<00:05:09.810> taking<00:05:10.470> home<00:05:10.800> our<00:05:10.980> catch<00:05:11.310> of<00:05:11.550> carp

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
a day and taking home our catch of carp

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.510 
a day and taking home our catch of carp
I<00:05:12.530> find<00:05:13.530> it<00:05:13.650> interesting

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
I find it interesting

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.120 
I find it interesting
most<00:05:15.000> of<00:05:15.270> the<00:05:15.390> fishermen<00:05:16.080> around<00:05:16.200> here<00:05:16.800> seem

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
most of the fishermen around here seem

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.340 
most of the fishermen around here seem
to<00:05:17.280> think<00:05:17.430> that<00:05:17.580> carp<00:05:18.000> is<00:05:18.270> a<00:05:18.300> trash<00:05:18.660> fish

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 
to think that carp is a trash fish

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.460 
to think that carp is a trash fish
but<00:05:19.830> that<00:05:19.980> view<00:05:20.190> seems<00:05:20.610> quite<00:05:21.150> unique<00:05:22.020> to

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:22.470 
but that view seems quite unique to

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.300 
but that view seems quite unique to
modern<00:05:23.310> Western<00:05:24.150> sport<00:05:24.660> fishermen<00:05:25.170> if<00:05:25.980> you<00:05:26.130> go

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310 
modern Western sport fishermen if you go

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:30.520 
modern Western sport fishermen if you go
