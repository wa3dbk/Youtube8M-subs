this is gonna take a while so if you

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.009 
this is gonna take a while so if you
don't<00:02:06.760> have<00:02:06.850> a<00:02:06.940> mixer<00:02:07.150> what<00:02:07.540> you<00:02:07.630> can<00:02:07.810> do

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.019 
don't have a mixer what you can do

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:09.300 
don't have a mixer what you can do
because<00:02:08.350> sometimes<00:02:08.530> it<00:02:08.769> takes<00:02:08.920> a<00:02:08.950> really<00:02:09.070> long

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
because sometimes it takes a really long

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.310 
because sometimes it takes a really long
time<00:02:09.459> to<00:02:09.519> stir<00:02:09.940> it<00:02:10.209> like<00:02:10.390> this<00:02:10.600> forever<00:02:10.929> and

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
mean like a mixer but if you don't have

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.699 
mean like a mixer but if you don't have
that<00:02:51.910> this<00:02:52.270> is<00:02:52.450> fine<00:02:52.630> but<00:02:53.050> it<00:02:53.170> just<00:02:53.290> takes<00:02:53.500> a

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
that this is fine but it just takes a

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:59.400 
that this is fine but it just takes a
lot<00:02:54.340> longer<00:02:54.610> so<00:02:56.519> okay<00:02:57.519> so<00:02:58.080> another<00:02:59.080> thing<00:02:59.170> to

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
lot longer so okay so another thing to

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.910 
lot longer so okay so another thing to
do<00:02:59.530> is<00:02:59.830> um<00:03:00.870> when<00:03:01.870> you<00:03:02.050> so<00:03:02.290> when<00:03:02.470> your<00:03:02.650> dough<00:03:02.860> is

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920
