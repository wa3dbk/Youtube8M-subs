00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 You know how to sew, then you can not. 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.680
 Saying that you can not do things, I 'm 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.900
 bringing an idea under construction in 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.940
 felt for you to make an American game 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.040
 even without knowing how to get there 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.379
 look there with the pictures of the game 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.529
 made in filter with these 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:23.160
 butterflies that support the cutlery give a 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.470
 charm and is quick to make 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.099
 You will not even believe that the 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.199
 work finish you will always be the 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.780
 province maximum works occasions 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.739
 for dinner and lunch for your day to 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.800
 day 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:41.010
 it is very easy fast and simple nor 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.530
 me to see how easy it is to do this 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.510
 so to start let's go there 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.300
 This American phelps game will need 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.750
 of felt and felt or the syntactic filter 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.739
 you find super easy stores 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.680
 fabric 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.879
 you will cut it into the dimension you 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.399
 to prefer 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.579
 and then you'll have to fold 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:06.900
 I in the model used a filter of 27 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:11.430
 inches tall then here is how it is 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:13.460
 folded in half it goes to 54 a 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:18.340
 small machine 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:21.130
 with this pen up here and how 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:28.430
 we have a square 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:31.009
 we mark here is where we should go to 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.680
 make the cut of our American game 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.300
 if you do not have a 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.850
 ensures that this will stay quiet 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:40.159
 you can use a ruler and mark a 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.680
 dot on top and another bridge on the bottom 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:46.190
 and will maintain the same consistency in the 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.479
 same job well done is a pair of scissors 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.800
 very sharp 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:55.070
 nothing more simple following the straight and 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.679
 Let's cut while I'm done. 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.649
 tell a secret so you know 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:03.350
 What is the secret of success in having a 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:06.970
 perfect cut to be felt or 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:10.459
 any other fabric is you ever 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.980
 close the scissors until the end because 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.480
 when we come to this end of the 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.030
 scissors closing 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.769
 it will take a step and it will transform 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.790
 your straight on something a little 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.670
 more pie 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:25.010
 this tip is useful for several things to 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.100
 This next cut we'll do 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.590
 is the cut of the butterflies 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.230
 these butterflies and bringing a mold 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:36.739
 this template here on paper 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.750
 we put it on the felt and the same 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:41.360
 way we've made the risk let's use a 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:45.519
 Nothing special little pen thing that 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:48.820
 You already have it in your house and we 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:51.440
 perimeter of the butterfly to be 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:54.200
 transferred to the tissue 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.690
 that's done calmly because it 's him who 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.640
 will guarantee the beauty of your work to 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:02.209
 beauty and regularity 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:05.480
 so go with it, go and go, calm down. 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:09.090
 following the silhouette of the butterfly going 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:12.760
 guide you in the cut 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:15.340
 Come on while we talk here. 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:20.410
 I already finished the butterfly transferred here 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:21.090
 ready for us to cut the same way 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.280
 who had previously spoken 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.860
 scissors without close scissors shears 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.530
 we reached several butterflies 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.610
 cut here that are already in our 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.190
 job 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.230
 if you get a bit intimidated in 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.540
 cut the butterflies 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.910
 You do not have to worry about places. 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.700
 on the internet that provides butterflies already 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.849
 cut into the colors and patterns you 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.810
 want and now with everything ready and 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:50.530
 organized 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:55.480
 Come on, let's go, the glue is hot. 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:58.209
 so let's put a little cola 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:02.620
 interesting and important in this 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:04.989
 work is to start with a few 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:08.440
 small extension for glue not to dry 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:13.780
 alone sooner than you wanted then 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:16.329
 We packed here felt and glue them one 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:22.660
 that is important. 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:24.880
 to get stuck and see here 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:31.529
 is missing a bit of the same 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:37.699
 way to proceed by placing the 

00:04:31.529 --> 00:04:40.559
 and there and pressing our work 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:42.599
 And now that we've put that aside 

00:04:40.559 --> 00:04:45.359
 let's go the other way 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:47.249
 what is the difference from here to here in this 

00:04:45.359 --> 00:04:50.129
 We'll put a ribbon of 

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:51.839
 satin so we can roll up our game 

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:53.639
 and close it if you want. 

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:55.829
 take anywhere your 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:58.559
 work for a picnic because you 

00:04:55.829 --> 00:05:03.229
 you do not have much science you also 

00:04:58.559 --> 00:05:06.989
 pick up a piece of satin ribbon cut 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:13.529
 always on the diagonal also for her not 

00:05:06.989 --> 00:05:18.449
 said to fold in half and put a 

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:22.049
 Penguin of our famous friend the tail 

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:27.329
 hot then here again 

00:05:22.049 --> 00:05:28.109
 pressing with the glue and pasting the 

00:05:27.329 --> 00:05:31.919
 job 

00:05:28.109 --> 00:05:33.299
 the finalization of this American game is 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:35.339
 The same way we saw it 

00:05:33.299 --> 00:05:36.209
 previously then glue here 

00:05:35.339 --> 00:05:38.909
 on here 

00:05:36.209 --> 00:05:40.319
 we close all the butterflies they 

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:44.189
 have an interesting tip 

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:48.319
 so come on, let's use two 

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:52.409
 butterflies for every American game. 

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:56.009
 inferior to the neck in five points 

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:59.369
 here on the two upper wings in the two 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:06:02.549
 and at the end of it and why 

00:05:59.369 --> 00:06:08.899
 because they will pick up and accommodate the 

00:06:02.549 --> 00:06:10.739
 cutlery then a small drop of glue 

00:06:08.899 --> 00:06:13.259
 on here 

00:06:10.739 --> 00:06:14.629
 I pressed first to put more 

00:06:13.259 --> 00:06:17.190
 a little 

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:23.390
 another droplet 

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:23.390
 one pressure is the same as the other time 

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:37.760
 and here the difference at the end of it 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:44.820
 also pressing 

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:48.030
 ready the butterfly is already glued to your 

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:51.870
 top American game ready people 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:55.340
 undertakes in four different points 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:59.010
 done that we got to that job 

00:06:55.340 --> 00:07:00.840
 finalized that as we have said can be 

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:02.430
 used on several occasions 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:05.190
 if you have any other activity 

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:07.730
 manual can make a crouch stick 

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:10.890
 of crochet comes back to give an extra charm 

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:13.140
 and now if you got excited and I hope 

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:15.300
 let me make the list of 

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:17.220
 materials to go with the 36 of a 

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:22.200
 american butterfly 

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:25.470
 come on in synthetic 42 by 54 

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:28.580
 two centimeters butterflies of the same 

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:32.730
 felt 40cm satin ribbon 

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:34.940
 hot glue pen scissors a ribbon 

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:34.940
