interesting<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.370> there's<00:00:38.550> never<00:00:38.700> really

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
interesting and there's never really

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.400 
interesting and there's never really
been<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.059> card<00:00:39.300> quite<00:00:39.570> like<00:00:39.780> this<00:00:39.989> it's<00:00:40.170> kind<00:00:40.379> of

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
been a card quite like this it's kind of

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.619 
been a card quite like this it's kind of
like<00:00:40.530> royal<00:00:41.370> decree<00:00:41.850> ish<00:00:41.969> makes<00:00:42.450> with

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
like royal decree ish makes with

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.069 
like royal decree ish makes with
darksome<00:00:43.110> Moorish<00:00:43.610> because<00:00:44.610> um<00:00:44.940> this<00:00:45.420> is<00:00:45.719> a

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
darksome Moorish because um this is a

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.410 
darksome Moorish because um this is a
continuous<00:00:46.649> effect<00:00:46.950> so<00:00:47.520> it<00:00:47.670> never<00:00:47.760> activates

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
continuous effect so it never activates

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.200 
continuous effect so it never activates
and<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:49.500> means<00:00:49.739> that<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:50.250> know<00:00:50.399> something

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
and that means that you know something

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.540 
and that means that you know something
like<00:00:51.360> satara<00:00:51.840> nova<00:00:52.079> alpha<00:00:52.530> stellar<00:00:53.219> nova

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
like satara nova alpha stellar nova

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.240 
like satara nova alpha stellar nova
alpha<00:00:53.850> can't<00:00:54.300> negate<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.020> also<00:00:55.410> the

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
alpha can't negate it and also the

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.549 
alpha can't negate it and also the
moment<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.670> hits<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.969> field<00:00:57.239> they<00:00:58.140> can't<00:00:58.469> even

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
moment it hits the field they can't even

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.560 
moment it hits the field they can't even
change<00:00:58.890> something<00:00:59.280> like<00:00:59.460> farm<00:01:00.000> lists<00:01:00.420> or

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
change something like farm lists or

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.330 
change something like farm lists or
compose<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.710> stocks<00:01:01.949> things<00:01:02.219> like

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
compose and the stocks things like

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.140 
compose and the stocks things like

cards and this thing stops and the only

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.080 
cards and this thing stops and the only
downside<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.070> really<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.640> that<00:01:11.790> you<00:01:11.909> do

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.539 
downside to it really is that you do
have<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.450> have<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.600> way<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.780> protect<00:01:12.960> it<00:01:13.409> out<00:01:14.070> XD

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.050 
have in back row so the best thing you
can<00:01:16.979> really<00:01:17.159> do<00:01:17.369> is<00:01:17.580> have<00:01:17.700> something<00:01:17.939> like

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
so you're not running something like I

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.130 
so you're not running something like I
guess<00:02:51.310> burning<00:02:51.640> abyss<00:02:51.730> and<00:02:52.209> maybe<00:02:52.780> the<00:02:52.930> card

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
guess burning abyss and maybe the card

guess burning abyss and maybe the card
of<00:02:53.230> it<00:02:53.350> it<00:02:53.440> might<00:02:53.620> be<00:02:53.770> a<00:02:53.800> bit<00:02:53.980> tough<00:02:54.160> to<00:02:54.220> swallow

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
of it it might be a bit tough to swallow

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.830 
of it it might be a bit tough to swallow
but<00:02:54.910> I<00:02:56.220> see<00:02:57.220> some<00:02:57.880> potential<00:02:58.180> with<00:02:58.420> this<00:02:58.450> card

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
but I see some potential with this card

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.840 
but I see some potential with this card
I<00:02:58.990> mean<00:02:59.170> outside<00:02:59.620> of<00:02:59.860> the<00:02:59.980> deck<00:03:00.160> that<00:03:00.310> is<00:03:00.400> meant

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
I mean outside of the deck that is meant

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.760 
I mean outside of the deck that is meant
to<00:03:00.940> be<00:03:01.060> used<00:03:01.270> in<00:03:01.510> it<00:03:01.660> is<00:03:01.780> a<00:03:01.810> dark<00:03:02.080> monster<00:03:02.620> so

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
to be used in it is a dark monster so

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.640 
to be used in it is a dark monster so
there<00:03:02.920> is<00:03:03.040> that<00:03:03.370> um<00:03:04.230> it's<00:03:05.230> something<00:03:05.290> that<00:03:05.590> I

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
there is that um it's something that I

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.290 
there is that um it's something that I
think<00:03:05.709> is<00:03:05.950> always<00:03:06.280> worth<00:03:06.550> sort<00:03:06.820> of<00:03:06.880> keeping<00:03:07.180> an

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
think is always worth sort of keeping an

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.259 
think is always worth sort of keeping an
eye<00:03:07.510> on<00:03:07.540> because<00:03:08.140> you<00:03:08.530> know<00:03:09.000> further<00:03:10.000> than<00:03:10.239> a

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
eye on because you know further than a

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.080 
eye on because you know further than a
line<00:03:10.570> if<00:03:11.019> we<00:03:11.230> get<00:03:11.410> more<00:03:11.680> dark<00:03:12.100> fiend<00:03:12.489> support

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
line if we get more dark fiend support

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.790 
line if we get more dark fiend support
or<00:03:13.360> more<00:03:13.570> support<00:03:13.989> for<00:03:14.110> level<00:03:14.350> threes<00:03:14.590> and

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
or more support for level threes and

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.080 
or more support for level threes and
this<00:03:14.950> can<00:03:15.130> only<00:03:15.250> get<00:03:15.519> better<00:03:15.550> if<00:03:15.910> you<00:03:16.000> know

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
this can only get better if you know

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.390 
this can only get better if you know
what<00:03:16.209> I<00:03:16.269> mean<00:03:16.300> the<00:03:17.080> next<00:03:17.230> card<00:03:17.530> is<00:03:17.650> night<00:03:17.920> Drago

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.600 
Lich now this is another interesting new
card<00:03:20.890> has<00:03:21.300> similar<00:03:22.300> stats<00:03:22.600> to<00:03:23.019> UM<00:03:23.380> bingo<00:03:24.280> Seca

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
card has similar stats to UM bingo Seca

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.660 
card has similar stats to UM bingo Seca
it<00:03:25.239> has<00:03:25.390> 700<00:03:25.959> attack<00:03:26.140> mendota<00:03:26.590> fitness<00:03:27.190> a<00:03:27.340> worm

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
it has 700 attack mendota fitness a worm

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.470 
it has 700 attack mendota fitness a worm
monster<00:03:27.940> to<00:03:28.390> wyr<00:03:29.170> him<00:03:29.739> monster<00:03:30.550> um<00:03:30.730> and

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.940 
monster to wyr him monster um and
basically<00:03:32.320> I<00:03:32.800> believe<00:03:33.580> its<00:03:34.360> effect<00:03:34.950> changes

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
basically I believe its effect changes

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.560 
basically I believe its effect changes
all<00:03:36.190> Attack<00:03:36.580> Position<00:03:36.820> monsters<00:03:37.420> that<00:03:37.510> are

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
all Attack Position monsters that are

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.540 
all Attack Position monsters that are
special<00:03:37.900> something<00:03:38.080> from<00:03:38.350> the<00:03:38.500> man<00:03:38.800> or<00:03:39.130> extra

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:39.550 
special something from the man or extra

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.000 
special something from the man or extra
deck<00:03:39.700> to<00:03:40.420> defense<00:03:40.780> position<00:03:41.230> and<00:03:41.410> they<00:03:41.739> lose

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
deck to defense position and they lose

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.520 
deck to defense position and they lose
defense<00:03:42.640> equal<00:03:43.090> to<00:03:43.269> their<00:03:43.540> original<00:03:43.690> defense

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
defense equal to their original defense

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.360 
defense equal to their original defense
um<00:03:46.019> unless<00:03:47.019> they're<00:03:47.290> worm<00:03:47.560> monster<00:03:47.739> I<00:03:48.070> believe

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
um unless they're worm monster I believe

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.300 
um unless they're worm monster I believe
so<00:03:49.239> this<00:03:49.840> basically<00:03:50.019> means<00:03:50.320> that<00:03:50.620> you<00:03:50.980> can

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
so this basically means that you can

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.870 
so this basically means that you can
summon<00:03:51.670> this<00:03:51.790> card<00:03:52.300> and<00:03:53.400> swing<00:03:54.400> over<00:03:54.550> anything

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
summon this card and swing over anything

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:56.250 
summon this card and swing over anything
those<00:03:55.150> special<00:03:55.540> summoned<00:03:55.810> from<00:03:55.870> the<00:03:55.959> extra

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
those special summoned from the extra

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.680 
those special summoned from the extra
deck<00:03:56.440> or<00:03:56.650> the<00:03:56.739> main<00:03:56.890> deck<00:03:57.130> and<00:03:57.480> with<00:03:58.480> ease

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
deck or the main deck and with ease

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.240 
deck or the main deck and with ease
because<00:03:58.870> will<00:03:59.110> effectively<00:03:59.560> have<00:03:59.830> like<00:03:59.980> zero

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
because will effectively have like zero

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.000 
because will effectively have like zero
defense<00:04:00.580> no<00:04:01.209> I<00:04:01.510> like<00:04:02.200> this<00:04:02.440> it's<00:04:02.680> also<00:04:02.830> the

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
defense no I like this it's also the

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.039 
defense no I like this it's also the
dark<00:04:03.220> monster<00:04:03.670> its<00:04:03.940> level<00:04:04.209> four<00:04:04.450> so<00:04:04.780> there's<00:04:04.959> a

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
dark monster its level four so there's a

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:05.920 
dark monster its level four so there's a
little<00:04:05.200> bit

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
little bit

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.200 
little bit
so<00:04:06.930> somewhat<00:04:07.740> synergy<00:04:08.190> I<00:04:08.340> mean<00:04:08.790> you<00:04:09.060> can

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:09.210 
so somewhat synergy I mean you can

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:10.100 
so somewhat synergy I mean you can
technically<00:04:09.480> bring<00:04:09.660> this<00:04:09.720> thing<00:04:09.870> out<00:04:09.990> with

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
technically bring this thing out with

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.690 
technically bring this thing out with
something<00:04:10.290> like<00:04:10.380> summoner<00:04:10.770> monk<00:04:10.980> and<00:04:11.220> since

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
something like summoner monk and since

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.640 
something like summoner monk and since
summoner<00:04:11.910> marco<00:04:12.180> v<00:04:12.330> and<00:04:12.600> defense<00:04:12.930> it<00:04:13.320> won't

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
summoner marco v and defense it won't

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.220 
summoner marco v and defense it won't
really<00:04:14.310> lose<00:04:15.210> anything<00:04:15.240> from<00:04:15.780> this<00:04:15.870> card<00:04:16.080> make

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
really lose anything from this card make

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.040

that's<00:04:19.170> been<00:04:19.290> coming<00:04:19.560> out<00:04:19.650> we<00:04:19.920> can<00:04:20.070> only

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
that's been coming out we can only

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.610 
that's been coming out we can only
imagine<00:04:20.610> this<00:04:20.970> card<00:04:21.270> wool<00:04:21.480> in<00:04:21.690> theory<00:04:22.500> have

imagine this card wool in theory have

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.100 
imagine this card wool in theory have
more<00:04:22.860> cards<00:04:23.520> to<00:04:23.610> back<00:04:23.910> it<00:04:24.090> up<00:04:24.240> i<00:04:24.510> think<00:04:25.020> it's

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
more cards to back it up i think it's

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.330 
more cards to back it up i think it's
really<00:04:25.320> cool<00:04:25.470> I<00:04:25.530> think<00:04:25.620> it's<00:04:25.860> sort<00:04:26.160> of<00:04:26.250> an

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
really cool I think it's sort of an

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.180 
really cool I think it's sort of an
answer<00:04:26.670> to<00:04:26.910> established<00:04:27.510> fields<00:04:27.990> and<00:04:28.200> I<00:04:28.800> like

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
answer to established fields and I like

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.220 
answer to established fields and I like
that<00:04:29.430> so<00:04:29.760> let's<00:04:30.330> not<00:04:30.480> own<00:04:30.630> your<00:04:30.750> card<00:04:30.990> that

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.380 
that so let's not own your card that

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390 
pretty interesting the next card is a

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:35.960 
pretty interesting the next card is a
trap<00:04:33.480> called<00:04:34.170> punch<00:04:34.500> in<00:04:34.650> the<00:04:34.740> box<00:04:34.970> basically

effects like hands stopping all the
typical<00:05:13.290> things<00:05:13.890> that<00:05:14.100> maybe<00:05:14.310> protect

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
typical things that maybe protect

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.870 
typical things that maybe protect
themselves<00:05:15.780> from<00:05:15.900> being<00:05:16.020> destroyed<00:05:16.290> and<00:05:16.950> also

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
themselves from being destroyed and also

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.790 
themselves from being destroyed and also
it<00:05:18.240> changes<00:05:18.720> attack<00:05:18.960> and<00:05:19.080> defense<00:05:19.380> so<00:05:19.560> it<00:05:19.680> can

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
it changes attack and defense so it can

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.790 
it changes attack and defense so it can
be<00:05:19.890> used<00:05:19.950> in<00:05:20.280> the<00:05:20.430> damage<00:05:20.790> step<00:05:21.030> and<00:05:21.800> things

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 
be used in the damage step and things

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.920 
be used in the damage step and things
like<00:05:22.950> compulsory<00:05:23.820> whatever<00:05:24.480> can't<00:05:24.810> be

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
like compulsory whatever can't be

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.600 
like compulsory whatever can't be
chained<00:05:25.200> to<00:05:25.350> this<00:05:25.500> so<00:05:26.100> it's<00:05:26.250> really<00:05:26.430> pretty

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
chained to this so it's really pretty

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.390 
chained to this so it's really pretty
neat<00:05:26.910> pretty<00:05:27.180> useful<00:05:27.450> cold<00:05:28.320> trap<00:05:28.620> it<00:05:28.920> might

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
neat pretty useful cold trap it might

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.710 
neat pretty useful cold trap it might
probably<00:05:29.670> won't<00:05:29.910> like<00:05:30.000> over<00:05:30.240> show<00:05:30.390> something

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 
probably won't like over show something

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.810 
probably won't like over show something
like<00:05:30.870> bear<00:05:31.050> Force<00:05:31.320> rd<00:05:31.530> prison<00:05:31.920> but<00:05:32.130> you<00:05:32.700> know<00:05:32.790> I

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 
like bear Force rd prison but you know I

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.340 
like bear Force rd prison but you know I
still<00:05:32.940> do<00:05:33.330> like<00:05:33.360> the<00:05:33.720> thought<00:05:33.900> and<00:05:34.140> it's

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:34.350 
still do like the thought and it's

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:35.540 
still do like the thought and it's
something<00:05:34.500> to<00:05:34.650> keep<00:05:34.770> your<00:05:34.950> eyes<00:05:35.040> on<00:05:35.070> and<00:05:35.520> the

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.130 
last card is fusion reserve this is a

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.340 
last card is fusion reserve this is a
neat<00:05:38.370> card<00:05:38.730> because<00:05:39.240> basically<00:05:39.660> it's<00:05:39.990> a<00:05:40.050> trap

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.350 
neat card because basically it's a trap

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.790 
neat card because basically it's a trap
and<00:05:40.790> you<00:05:41.790> reveal<00:05:42.630> a<00:05:42.660> fusion<00:05:43.470> monster<00:05:43.500> from

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
and you reveal a fusion monster from

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.700 
and you reveal a fusion monster from
your<00:05:43.980> extra<00:05:44.370> deck<00:05:44.400> and<00:05:44.820> add<00:05:45.560> one<00:05:46.560> of<00:05:46.590> the

the card from your deck straight to your

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:52.550 
the card from your deck straight to your
hand<00:05:50.880> then<00:05:51.540> you<00:05:51.780> can<00:05:51.900> add<00:05:52.020> a<00:05:52.050> polymerization

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:52.560 
hand then you can add a polymerization

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:55.520 
hand then you can add a polymerization
from<00:05:52.890> your<00:05:53.010> graveyard<00:05:53.340> to<00:05:53.850> your<00:05:53.880> hand<00:05:54.210> now<00:05:54.990> the

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
second effect may not always be useful

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:01.410 
necessarily use polymerization to do it

like<00:06:01.620> heroes<00:06:02.070> or<00:06:02.490> dolls<00:06:03.180> will<00:06:03.840> some<00:06:04.169> emotional

mean anyway so um pretty need and I

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.559 
mean anyway so um pretty need and I
really<00:06:11.039> like<00:06:11.219> this<00:06:11.430> because<00:06:11.669> this<00:06:12.060> is<00:06:12.120> support

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:12.569 
really like this because this is support

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:15.529 
really like this because this is support
you<00:06:13.439> know<00:06:13.530> I<00:06:13.560> guess<00:06:13.830> for<00:06:14.159> the<00:06:14.250> first<00:06:14.729> thing<00:06:15.330> you

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:15.539 
you know I guess for the first thing you

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:17.059 
you know I guess for the first thing you
would<00:06:15.629> think<00:06:15.780> about<00:06:15.930> these<00:06:16.319> new<00:06:16.379> fusion

00:06:17.059 --> 00:06:17.069 
would think about these new fusion

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:20.209 
would think about these new fusion
archetypes<00:06:17.520> like<00:06:17.819> the<00:06:18.530> Fluffles<00:06:19.530> should<00:06:20.099> all

00:06:20.209 --> 00:06:20.219 
archetypes like the Fluffles should all

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:22.520 
archetypes like the Fluffles should all
those<00:06:20.370> things<00:06:20.669> like<00:06:20.789> that<00:06:20.909> but<00:06:21.629> heroes<00:06:22.229> can

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:22.530 
those things like that but heroes can

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:25.070 
those things like that but heroes can
use<00:06:22.710> this<00:06:23.030> gladiator<00:06:24.030> beats<00:06:24.479> can<00:06:24.659> use<00:06:24.810> this<00:06:24.930> is

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:25.080 
use this gladiator beats can use this is

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:26.480 
use this gladiator beats can use this is
can<00:06:25.229> actually<00:06:25.469> search<00:06:25.740> a<00:06:25.860> gladiator<00:06:26.250> beast

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.490 
can actually search a gladiator beast

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.510 
can actually search a gladiator beast
because<00:06:26.729> you<00:06:27.030> can<00:06:27.150> reveal<00:06:27.389> something<00:06:27.719> like

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:28.520 
because you can reveal something like

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:33.140 
because you can reveal something like
srs<00:06:29.520> and<00:06:29.969> start<00:06:30.210> tube<00:06:30.360> stre<00:06:31.669> they<00:06:32.669> really<00:06:33.000> are

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:33.150 
srs and start tube stre they really are

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:34.730 
srs and start tube stre they really are
quite<00:06:33.389> a<00:06:33.449> few<00:06:33.569> different<00:06:34.050> possibilities<00:06:34.650> you

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:34.740 
quite a few different possibilities you

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.230 
quite a few different possibilities you
can<00:06:34.770> use<00:06:35.039> on<00:06:35.219> their<00:06:35.340> loads<00:06:35.610> of<00:06:35.759> fusion<00:06:36.030> decks

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 
can use on their loads of fusion decks

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.300 
can use on their loads of fusion decks
i'm<00:06:36.509> not<00:06:36.780> a<00:06:36.810> fusion<00:06:37.139> expert<00:06:37.710> but<00:06:38.069> the<00:06:38.129> fact

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:38.310 
i'm not a fusion expert but the fact

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:40.189 
i'm not a fusion expert but the fact
that<00:06:38.370> matter<00:06:38.550> is<00:06:38.639> I<00:06:39.000> see<00:06:39.330> potential<00:06:39.659> here<00:06:40.050> I

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:40.199 
that matter is I see potential here I

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:44.269 
that matter is I see potential here I
think<00:06:40.680> it's<00:06:40.770> something<00:06:40.949> to<00:06:41.039> look<00:06:41.069> at<00:06:41.400> and<00:06:43.279> more

00:06:44.269 --> 00:06:44.279 
think it's something to look at and more

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:47.570 
think it's something to look at and more
fusion<00:06:44.520> support<00:06:45.000> and<00:06:45.449> never<00:06:45.659> heard<00:06:45.840> right<00:06:46.580> so

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:47.580 
fusion support and never heard right so

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.390 
fusion support and never heard right so
