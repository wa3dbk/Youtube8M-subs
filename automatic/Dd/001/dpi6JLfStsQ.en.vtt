00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:35.490 
notation we're going to take that open

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:36.650 
notation we're going to take that open
idea<00:05:35.820> we're<00:05:36.090> going<00:05:36.210> to<00:05:36.270> move<00:05:36.390> it<00:05:36.510> into

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
idea we're going to move it into

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:45.650 
idea we're going to move it into
different<00:05:37.020> positions<00:05:37.140> so<00:05:38.100> Incy<00:05:44.480> you'll<00:05:45.480> be

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:12.740 
same melody or the same idea just in a

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.530 
same melody or the same idea just in a
different<00:06:12.860> place<00:06:13.130> on<00:06:13.400> the<00:06:13.520> fretboard<00:06:13.790> but<00:06:14.420> the

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:14.540 
different place on the fretboard but the

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.000 
different place on the fretboard but the
idea<00:06:14.750> here<00:06:14.870> is<00:06:14.930> not<00:06:15.260> only<00:06:15.290> a<00:06:15.530> technique

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:16.010 
idea here is not only a technique

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:17.590 
idea here is not only a technique
exercise<00:06:16.580> but<00:06:16.850> hopefully<00:06:17.210> it'll<00:06:17.330> kind<00:06:17.540> of

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:17.600 
exercise but hopefully it'll kind of

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.090 
exercise but hopefully it'll kind of
open<00:06:17.870> up<00:06:17.960> the<00:06:18.110> fretboard<00:06:18.290> a<00:06:18.620> little<00:06:18.800> bit<00:06:18.920> for

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:19.100 
open up the fretboard a little bit for

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.520 
open up the fretboard a little bit for
you<00:06:19.220> as<00:06:19.340> well
