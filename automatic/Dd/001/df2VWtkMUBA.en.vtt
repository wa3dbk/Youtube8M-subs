us apart from everybody else is the fact
that<00:00:19.730> we<00:00:19.970> we<00:00:20.510> have<00:00:20.630> solar<00:00:20.840> panels<00:00:20.990> we<00:00:21.200> have

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:21.290 
that we we have solar panels we have

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.260 
that we we have solar panels we have
five<00:00:21.410> solar<00:00:21.620> panels<00:00:21.920> on<00:00:21.980> the<00:00:22.070> roof<00:00:22.220> we<00:00:23.120> have

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
up our AGM batteries inside of it so

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.940 
up our AGM batteries inside of it so
nobody<00:00:29.720> else<00:00:29.930> really<00:00:30.020> has<00:00:30.230> that<00:00:30.560> nobody<00:00:30.800> has

generator<00:00:34.399> we<00:00:34.670> try<00:00:34.820> to<00:00:34.879> stay<00:00:35.059> away<00:00:35.210> from<00:00:35.239> that

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
generator we try to stay away from that

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.610 
generator we try to stay away from that
we<00:00:35.570> want<00:00:35.719> to<00:00:35.780> keep<00:00:35.839> it<00:00:35.960> as<00:00:36.050> earth<00:00:36.199> friendly<00:00:36.530> as

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:36.620 
we want to keep it as earth friendly as

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.259 
we want to keep it as earth friendly as
possible<00:00:37.100> we're<00:00:37.249> designed<00:00:37.550> to<00:00:37.640> go<00:00:37.760> out<00:00:37.940> and

00:00:38.259 --> 00:00:38.269 
possible we're designed to go out and

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:40.149 
possible we're designed to go out and
stay<00:00:38.629> outside<00:00:38.809> for<00:00:39.320> a<00:00:39.350> really<00:00:39.589> long<00:00:39.769> time<00:00:40.010> with

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:40.159 
stay outside for a really long time with

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:42.099 
stay outside for a really long time with
having<00:00:40.399> to<00:00:40.460> go<00:00:40.550> back<00:00:40.730> and<00:00:41.059> so<00:00:41.300> can<00:00:41.719> you<00:00:41.870> just

00:00:42.099 --> 00:00:42.109 
having to go back and so can you just

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:44.380 
having to go back and so can you just
put<00:00:42.260> questions<00:00:42.649> can<00:00:43.129> you<00:00:43.159> run<00:00:43.609> your<00:00:44.210> air

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
put questions can you run your air

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.299 
put questions can you run your air
conditioner<00:00:44.839> on<00:00:45.019> your<00:00:45.260> solar<00:00:45.530> power<00:00:45.710> yes<00:00:46.159> we

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
conditioner on your solar power yes we

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:49.029 
conditioner on your solar power yes we
get<00:00:46.429> yes<00:00:46.550> you<00:00:47.269> can<00:00:47.480> it<00:00:48.019> is<00:00:48.199> what<00:00:48.679> it's<00:00:48.859> based

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:49.039 
get yes you can it is what it's based

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:50.770 
get yes you can it is what it's based
off<00:00:49.159> of<00:00:49.219> it's<00:00:49.429> off<00:00:49.609> the<00:00:49.789> 120<00:00:50.239> volt<00:00:50.449> because<00:00:50.569> we

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
off of it's off the 120 volt because we

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.809 
off of it's off the 120 volt because we
do<00:00:50.870> have<00:00:50.989> our<00:00:51.050> inverters<00:00:51.469> inside<00:00:51.800> of<00:00:51.920> it<00:00:52.039> so

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:52.819 
do have our inverters inside of it so

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:54.849 
do have our inverters inside of it so
you<00:00:52.909> can<00:00:53.149> run<00:00:53.300> it<00:00:53.420> it<00:00:53.600> depends<00:00:54.019> on<00:00:54.140> just<00:00:54.289> how

00:00:54.849 --> 00:00:54.859 
you can run it it depends on just how

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:56.500 
you can run it it depends on just how
hot<00:00:55.010> out<00:00:55.190> it<00:00:55.370> is<00:00:55.489> but<00:00:55.819> you<00:00:55.909> can<00:00:56.030> usually<00:00:56.149> run<00:00:56.359> it

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
hot out it is but you can usually run it

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:57.489 
hot out it is but you can usually run it
for<00:00:56.629> quite<00:00:56.749> a<00:00:56.780> few<00:00:56.929> hours<00:00:57.019> straight<00:00:57.260> just

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:57.499 
for quite a few hours straight just

00:00:57.499 --> 00:00:59.559 
for quite a few hours straight just
right<00:00:57.679> off<00:00:57.800> the<00:00:57.829> 255<00:00:58.639> the<00:00:58.789> power<00:00:58.999> batteries<00:00:59.420> go

00:00:59.559 --> 00:00:59.569 
right off the 255 the power batteries go

00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:01.509 
right off the 255 the power batteries go
for<00:00:59.809> of<00:00:59.929> them<00:01:00.019> like<00:01:00.170> I<00:01:00.260> say<00:01:00.440> but<00:01:01.129> if<00:01:01.339> the

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:01.519 
for of them like I say but if the

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:03.910 
for of them like I say but if the
batteries<00:01:01.819> do<00:01:01.999> get<00:01:02.179> low<00:01:02.329> you<00:01:02.629> can<00:01:03.139> start<00:01:03.800> the

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
batteries do get low you can start the

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.709 
batteries do get low you can start the
truck<00:01:04.100> and<00:01:04.309> use<00:01:04.489> the<00:01:04.640> truck<00:01:04.820> as<00:01:05.000> a<00:01:05.239> form<00:01:05.540> of<00:01:05.659> a

00:01:05.709 --> 00:01:05.719 
truck and use the truck as a form of a

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:07.840 
truck and use the truck as a form of a
generator<00:01:06.140> and<00:01:06.409> that<00:01:06.590> you<00:01:06.890> can<00:01:07.040> run<00:01:07.189> the<00:01:07.340> you

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
generator and that you can run the you

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.789 
generator and that you can run the you
can<00:01:08.000> run<00:01:08.149> it<00:01:08.270> consistently<00:01:08.899> but<00:01:09.380> generally

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:09.799 
can run it consistently but generally

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:12.550 
can run it consistently but generally
speaking<00:01:09.829> you<00:01:10.159> can<00:01:10.399> run<00:01:10.549> it<00:01:10.670> on<00:01:11.060> low<00:01:11.420> for<00:01:11.719> quite

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
speaking you can run it on low for quite

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.600 
speaking you can run it on low for quite
a<00:01:12.590> while<00:01:12.740> for<00:01:12.920> quite<00:01:13.070> a<00:01:13.130> few<00:01:13.280> hours<00:01:13.399> without

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
a while for quite a few hours without

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:14.709 
a while for quite a few hours without
have<00:01:13.880> to<00:01:13.909> worry<00:01:14.119> about<00:01:14.210> the<00:01:14.360> batteries<00:01:14.659> very

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:14.719 
have to worry about the batteries very

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:16.959 
have to worry about the batteries very
cool<00:01:15.200> and<00:01:15.680> so<00:01:15.920> when<00:01:16.159> you<00:01:16.250> say<00:01:16.399> it's<00:01:16.520> like<00:01:16.640> super

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:16.969 
cool and so when you say it's like super

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:19.029 
cool and so when you say it's like super
insulated<00:01:17.390> how<00:01:18.140> does<00:01:18.409> it<00:01:18.530> handle<00:01:18.710> like

00:01:19.029 --> 00:01:19.039 
insulated how does it handle like

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:22.090 
insulated how does it handle like
extreme<00:01:19.880> heat<00:01:20.390> and<00:01:20.420> coolness<00:01:21.259> um<00:01:21.469> well<00:01:22.009> we

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
extreme heat and coolness um well we

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.440 
extreme heat and coolness um well we
actually<00:01:22.369> did<00:01:22.490> the<00:01:22.579> test<00:01:22.789> into<00:01:23.060> going<00:01:23.180> on<00:01:23.329> one

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
actually did the test into going on one

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.200 
actually did the test into going on one
time<00:01:23.659> last<00:01:24.140> winter<00:01:24.350> it<00:01:24.770> got<00:01:24.950> negative<00:01:25.579> 16

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
time last winter it got negative 16

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.660 
time last winter it got negative 16
negative<00:01:26.240> 17<00:01:26.930> degrees<00:01:27.259> at<00:01:27.590> our<00:01:27.619> shop<00:01:28.100> and<00:01:28.399> so

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
negative 17 degrees at our shop and so

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:29.889
