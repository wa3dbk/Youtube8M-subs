00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:08.010
 3211 the new owner for the first 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.320
 case is found he is one of 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.940
 around 60,000 bags per year 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.160
 whose owner is no longer determined 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.139
 can be at nearly 80 million 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.119
 lufthansa transports baggage annually 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.490
 the world flies is worth a visit 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.650
 promille area almost always can 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.570
 Missing suitcase within 24 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.189
 hours isolated and the passenger 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.289
 be returned 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.029
 only if the luggage also after 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.399
 intensive search is no longer assigned 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.410
 the funds can follow 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.829
 three months in customs warehouse among the 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.379
 hammer on cheap goods from Far East brands 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.790
 suitcases or designer bags most 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.480
 bidders, it is mainly on the 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.190
 content 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.649
 and there are luck and bad luck 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.469
 together I think that's special 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.449
 so the unknown what awaits you 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.680
 Although so I helped yesterday 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.440
 to invite the suitcases 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.610
 but in the end when we have the bags 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.360
 you can always unpack a bit 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.910
 a surprise 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.370
 spontaneity so a bit yes that 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.369
 Attraction of the unknown in the city hall 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.619
 von bentheim speculate on 115 bidders 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.720
 a special bargain cash 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.430
 drugs or even weapons they will be in the 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.049
 However, do not find the funds 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.970
 since the luggage already from 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.640
 Customs officers have been searched 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.369
 valuables stay in the suitcases and 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.200
 that is exactly what the bidders hope for 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.659
 They regularly visit the auction 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.110
 from fraport and lufthansa as well as lutz 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.590
 rich 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.790
 he always has a binoculars with him 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.970
 so that one sees much better if the 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.759
 Condition of suitcase is also ok 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.290
 still the one to tell the other 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.270
 sometimes not the brand of copper around 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.250
 in the window you can see that then optional 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.729
 stands or american tourist or 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.740
 like this 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.659
 because this curve is usually something 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.520
 give more expensive way because the magician said 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.830
 If this is forgotten then you have 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.900
 advantage 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.670
 the suitcase is then cheaper because not 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.350
 to bid so many people 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.810
 the prices for the funds can be 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.790
 vary greatly for brands suitcases 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.940
 paid up to 400 euros 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:04.340
 the sales area will be 18 percent 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.900
 for the auction house pitched the 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.730
 is then the merit for the events 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.510
 on this amount is still the 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.180
 value added tax 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:13.100
 which is also paid by the provider 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.110
 Lufthansa is packing different pieces 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.710
 in the so-called surprise boxes 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.480
 together 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.750
 they are on the auctions at the 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:25.300
 offer very popular I have now 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:27.730
 40 paid plus stopped of course 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.980
 I'm not satisfied right now 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:34.130
 with the content because usually in the 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.590
 boxing has a lot yes so 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.660
 The electronics continue to go well 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.360
 be sold or self-usable 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.910
 I have already over several times 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.860
 They all bought the money in any case 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.450
 Were worth this box , it was more likely 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.610
 They do not have to pack together now 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.780
 but something great discovered or exactly 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.780
 properly so it was still a 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.180
 to find ipod 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:59.000
 Of course, that's my judgment 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:02.989
 think it's worth a box 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.090
 Every single piece of luggage is one 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.730
 kind of surprise bag for adults with more 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.709
 or less valuable content important 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.510
 is therefore before the auction 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.090
 personal limit to set 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.050
 around 500 homes change per auction 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.209
 the owner 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:22.070
 and sometimes there are very special ones 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:25.190
 lucky ones it has us a doctor 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:28.400
 Guys really dress size 46 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:30.080
 maybe that's just him 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.970
 had bought suitcases because he had one 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.459
 needs and happens to have his 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.470
 even drug size found in it 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:39.140
 that was, of course, creates new things 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.070
 unworn but that's just the 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.620
 exception 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:45.200
 in general one must assume in the 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.820
 suitcases are enough things but 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.489
 mostly not the things the one 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:51.880
 would fit 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:53.740
 that's how it is on this day 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.020
 all suitcases we are allowed to look into 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.420
 is wearing clothes in 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.250
 all colors shapes and sizes in 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.830
 some of the luggage comes from the 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.840
 clothing even from famous brands but 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.000
 most bidders want to go home 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.230
 Look in your suitcase so that it 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.400
 certainly some surprises 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:11.400
 should give
