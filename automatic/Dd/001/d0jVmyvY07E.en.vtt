00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.080 
easy that has tons and tons of potential

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.050 
easy that has tons and tons of potential
you<00:00:29.500> can<00:00:29.740> totally<00:00:29.920> create<00:00:30.550> infinite

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.060 
you can totally create infinite

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.500 
you can totally create infinite
possibilities<00:00:31.930> with<00:00:32.140> this<00:00:32.290> technique<00:00:32.710> so<00:00:33.510> let

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
possibilities with this technique so let

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.240 
possibilities with this technique so let
me<00:00:34.600> get<00:00:34.750> started<00:00:34.990> showing<00:00:35.320> you<00:00:35.680> what<00:00:36.070> you're

me get started showing you what you're
going<00:00:36.370> to<00:00:36.520> need<00:00:36.760> and<00:00:37.210> today<00:00:38.140> we're<00:00:38.350> working

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:38.500 
going to need and today we're working

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.810 
going to need and today we're working
with<00:00:38.739> liquid<00:00:39.489> polymer<00:00:40.180> clays<00:00:40.630> and<00:00:41.640> if<00:00:42.640> you're

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
with liquid polymer clays and if you're

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.210 
with liquid polymer clays and if you're
not<00:00:42.940> familiar<00:00:43.059> with<00:00:43.390> them<00:00:43.750> this<00:00:44.410> is<00:00:44.650> one<00:00:45.130> of

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.220 
not familiar with them this is one of

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.910 
not familiar with them this is one of
the<00:00:45.280> brands<00:00:45.820> it's<00:00:46.150> fimo<00:00:46.900> brand<00:00:47.230> decorating

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
the brands it's fimo brand decorating

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.380 
the brands it's fimo brand decorating
gel<00:00:48.160> is<00:00:48.370> what<00:00:48.520> they<00:00:48.670> call<00:00:48.910> it<00:00:49.180> and<00:00:51.000> each<00:00:52.000> of<00:00:52.059> the

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
gel is what they call it and each of the

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:53.820 
gel is what they call it and each of the
liquid<00:00:52.720> clays<00:00:52.960> have<00:00:53.200> a<00:00:53.230> little<00:00:53.500> different

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:53.830 
liquid clays have a little different

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.830 
liquid clays have a little different
properties<00:00:54.400> and<00:00:54.790> you'll<00:00:55.000> see<00:00:55.240> once<00:00:55.480> you<00:00:55.600> start

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
properties and you'll see once you start

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.770 
properties and you'll see once you start
to<00:00:55.930> play<00:00:56.140> with<00:00:56.170> them<00:00:56.650> and<00:00:57.240> they<00:00:58.240> also<00:00:58.420> have<00:00:58.750> a

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 
to play with them and they also have a

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.650 
to play with them and they also have a
difference<00:00:59.320> in<00:00:59.680> their<00:01:00.040> transparencies<00:01:00.940> so

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
difference in their transparencies so

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.079 
difference in their transparencies so
for<00:01:02.320> this<00:01:02.410> project<00:01:02.710> the<00:01:03.070> transparency<00:01:03.790> does

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:04.089 
for this project the transparency does

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:06.420 
for this project the transparency does
not<00:01:04.300> matter<00:01:04.630> but<00:01:05.140> if<00:01:05.560> for<00:01:05.800> other<00:01:05.920> projects<00:01:06.400> you

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
not matter but if for other projects you

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.030 
not matter but if for other projects you
might<00:01:06.610> consider<00:01:07.030> that<00:01:07.119> so<00:01:07.960> anyways<00:01:08.680> this<00:01:08.860> is

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
might consider that so anyways this is

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.070 
might consider that so anyways this is
the<00:01:09.070> fimo<00:01:09.729> decorating<00:01:10.330> gel<00:01:10.570> that<00:01:10.869> we're<00:01:10.990> gonna

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
the fimo decorating gel that we're gonna

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.770 
the fimo decorating gel that we're gonna
use<00:01:11.440> and<00:01:11.890> this<00:01:12.820> is<00:01:12.880> the<00:01:13.119> liquid<00:01:13.330> sculpey<00:01:14.229> and

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
use and this is the liquid sculpey and

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.030 
use and this is the liquid sculpey and
let<00:01:16.780> me<00:01:16.869> give<00:01:16.990> you<00:01:17.080> an<00:01:17.170> idea<00:01:17.200> of<00:01:17.500> what<00:01:17.680> I<00:01:17.710> used

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
let me give you an idea of what I used

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.130 
let me give you an idea of what I used
on<00:01:18.550> each<00:01:18.729> of<00:01:18.880> these<00:01:18.970> pieces<00:01:19.210> of<00:01:19.479> fabric<00:01:19.960> so

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
on each of these pieces of fabric so

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.540 
on each of these pieces of fabric so
you'll<00:01:20.290> know<00:01:20.470> and<00:01:20.740> you're<00:01:21.160> gonna<00:01:21.280> need<00:01:21.490> a

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
you'll know and you're gonna need a

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.940 
you'll know and you're gonna need a
piece<00:01:21.790> of<00:01:21.820> fabric<00:01:21.940> and<00:01:22.600> I<00:01:23.170> just<00:01:23.350> chose<00:01:23.619> a

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
piece of fabric and I just chose a

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.529 
piece of fabric and I just chose a
random<00:01:24.520> piece<00:01:24.700> which<00:01:25.000> I<00:01:25.090> thought<00:01:25.270> was<00:01:25.420> really

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:25.539 
random piece which I thought was really

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:28.290 
random piece which I thought was really
cool<00:01:25.840> which<00:01:26.140> I<00:01:26.380> can<00:01:26.830> see<00:01:27.100> could<00:01:27.399> be<00:01:27.550> wings<00:01:27.850> for

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
cool which I can see could be wings for

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.760 
cool which I can see could be wings for
a<00:01:28.330> butterfly<00:01:28.929> or<00:01:30.360> for<00:01:31.360> a<00:01:31.390> fairy<00:01:31.810> or<00:01:32.259> an<00:01:32.500> angel

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
a butterfly or for a fairy or an angel

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.559 
a butterfly or for a fairy or an angel
something<00:01:33.520> really<00:01:33.729> cool<00:01:33.910> I<00:01:33.940> could<00:01:34.240> make<00:01:34.390> out

00:01:34.559 --> 00:01:34.569 
something really cool I could make out

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:36.990 
something really cool I could make out
of<00:01:34.600> this<00:01:34.869> so<00:01:35.190> what<00:01:36.190> I<00:01:36.220> did<00:01:36.310> was<00:01:36.550> I<00:01:36.670> just<00:01:36.700> took<00:01:36.880> a

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
of this so what I did was I just took a

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.050 
of this so what I did was I just took a
piece<00:01:37.240> a<00:01:37.590> regular<00:01:38.590> you<00:01:39.220> know<00:01:39.250> fabric<00:01:39.880> this<00:01:40.000> is

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
piece a regular you know fabric this is

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.059 
piece a regular you know fabric this is
a<00:01:40.179> hundred<00:01:40.420> percent<00:01:40.509> cotton<00:01:40.959> I<00:01:41.200> believe<00:01:41.530> and<00:01:41.770> I

00:01:42.059 --> 00:01:42.069 
a hundred percent cotton I believe and I

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:43.859 
a hundred percent cotton I believe and I
have<00:01:42.429> not<00:01:42.550> tried<00:01:42.729> polyester<00:01:43.360> or<00:01:43.390> any<00:01:43.630> of<00:01:43.780> the

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
have not tried polyester or any of the

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:46.499 
have not tried polyester or any of the
other<00:01:44.020> kinds<00:01:44.440> of<00:01:44.530> fabrics<00:01:44.920> so<00:01:45.100> this<00:01:46.090> is<00:01:46.240> about

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
other kinds of fabrics so this is about

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:49.710 
other kinds of fabrics so this is about
cotton<00:01:46.959> only<00:01:47.560> and<00:01:47.940> you<00:01:48.940> can<00:01:49.119> certainly<00:01:49.390> try

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
cotton only and you can certainly try

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.270 
cotton only and you can certainly try
those<00:01:50.080> and<00:01:50.440> see<00:01:50.920> what<00:01:51.039> works<00:01:51.220> for<00:01:51.310> you<00:01:51.600> so<00:01:53.250> so<00:01:54.250> I

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
those and see what works for you so so I

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.800 
those and see what works for you so so I
could<00:01:54.490> tell<00:01:54.640> the<00:01:54.729> difference<00:01:54.759> between<00:01:55.240> which

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
could tell the difference between which

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.150 
could tell the difference between which
I<00:01:56.080> used<00:01:56.440> I<00:01:57.270> added<00:01:58.270> glitter<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:59.649> the<00:01:59.770> fimo<00:02:00.130> gel

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160 
I used I added glitter to the fimo gel

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.109 
I used I added glitter to the fimo gel
one<00:02:01.030> and<00:02:01.410> the<00:02:02.410> liquid<00:02:02.709> sculpey<00:02:03.250> I<00:02:03.490> did<00:02:03.759> not<00:02:03.880> add

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
one and the liquid sculpey I did not add

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.059 
one and the liquid sculpey I did not add
any<00:02:04.149> glitter<00:02:04.660> so<00:02:05.440> you<00:02:05.530> can<00:02:05.770> see<00:02:05.920> the

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:06.069 
any glitter so you can see the

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:09.270 
any glitter so you can see the
difference<00:02:06.429> and<00:02:06.729> I<00:02:07.630> also<00:02:08.590> have<00:02:08.800> a<00:02:08.860> brush<00:02:09.099> and

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
difference and I also have a brush and

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.250 
difference and I also have a brush and
of<00:02:09.369> course<00:02:09.580> a<00:02:09.729> pair<00:02:09.910> of<00:02:09.940> scissors<00:02:10.209> to<00:02:11.080> get

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
of course a pair of scissors to get

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.550 
of course a pair of scissors to get
started<00:02:11.680> but<00:02:12.450> just<00:02:13.450> so<00:02:13.630> you<00:02:13.690> can<00:02:13.959> see<00:02:14.319> the

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
started but just so you can see the

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.330 
started but just so you can see the
difference<00:02:14.980> this<00:02:15.910> one<00:02:16.120> has<00:02:16.270> the<00:02:16.450> glitter<00:02:16.660> and

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
difference this one has the glitter and

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.130 
difference this one has the glitter and
once<00:02:18.340> I've<00:02:18.520> added<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:18.940> liquid<00:02:19.300> sculpey<00:02:19.569> it

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
once I've added the liquid sculpey it

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.610 
once I've added the liquid sculpey it
becomes<00:02:20.640> almost<00:02:21.640> like<00:02:21.790> an<00:02:21.940> oil<00:02:22.270> cloth<00:02:22.780> and<00:02:23.200> the

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
becomes almost like an oil cloth and the

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.070 
becomes almost like an oil cloth and the
fimo<00:02:23.980> gel<00:02:24.010> was<00:02:24.670> much<00:02:25.060> thicker<00:02:25.390> than<00:02:25.540> liquid

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
fimo gel was much thicker than liquid

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.430 
fimo gel was much thicker than liquid
sculpey<00:02:26.349> and<00:02:26.830> you

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
sculpey and you

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.230 
sculpey and you
as<00:02:27.710> I<00:02:27.830> start<00:02:28.670> to<00:02:28.700> pour<00:02:28.970> it<00:02:29.120> out<00:02:29.240> I<00:02:30.220> prefer<00:02:31.240> the

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
as I start to pour it out I prefer the

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.070 
as I start to pour it out I prefer the
fimo<00:02:32.810> decorating<00:02:33.710> gel<00:02:34.040> for<00:02:34.970> the<00:02:35.000> texture<00:02:35.840> it

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
fimo decorating gel for the texture it

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.810 
fimo decorating gel for the texture it
creates<00:02:36.470> and<00:02:36.710> it's<00:02:36.830> just<00:02:37.010> a<00:02:37.100> thicker<00:02:37.480> more

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
creates and it's just a thicker more

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.750 
creates and it's just a thicker more
texturized<00:02:40.820> kind<00:02:41.480> of<00:02:41.710> feel<00:02:42.710> so<00:02:43.430> it's<00:02:43.610> totally

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
texturized kind of feel so it's totally

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.060 
texturized kind of feel so it's totally
up<00:02:44.000> to<00:02:44.030> you<00:02:44.330> and<00:02:44.540> it's<00:02:44.660> totally<00:02:44.870> up<00:02:44.960> up<00:02:45.200> to<00:02:45.440> what

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
up to you and it's totally up up to what

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.520 
up to you and it's totally up up to what
look<00:02:46.310> you<00:02:46.490> are<00:02:46.640> going<00:02:46.970> for<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:48.110> liquid

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
look you are going for the liquid

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.890 
look you are going for the liquid
sculpey<00:02:48.770> created<00:02:49.670> more<00:02:49.910> of<00:02:49.940> like<00:02:50.420> a<00:02:50.450> Madi

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
sculpey created more of like a Madi

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.670 
sculpey created more of like a Madi
matted<00:02:51.860> finish<00:02:52.040> more<00:02:52.760> a<00:02:53.120> very<00:02:53.750> thin<00:02:54.170> it's<00:02:54.410> it

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
matted finish more a very thin it's it

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.490 
matted finish more a very thin it's it
still<00:02:54.800> has<00:02:55.160> that<00:02:55.600> texture<00:02:56.600> to<00:02:56.780> it<00:02:56.810> but<00:02:57.320> it's

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
still has that texture to it but it's

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.030 
still has that texture to it but it's
dinner<00:02:58.030> um<00:02:59.030> then<00:02:59.720> the<00:02:59.990> fimo<00:03:00.560> and<00:03:00.710> I<00:03:00.770> don't<00:03:00.830> know

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
dinner um then the fimo and I don't know

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.740 
dinner um then the fimo and I don't know
if<00:03:01.190> it's<00:03:01.280> because<00:03:01.400> one's<00:03:01.970> older<00:03:02.360> than<00:03:02.600> the

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
if it's because one's older than the

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.960 
if it's because one's older than the
other<00:03:02.900> you'll<00:03:03.890> have<00:03:03.950> to<00:03:04.190> experiment<00:03:04.520> because

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
other you'll have to experiment because

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.630 
other you'll have to experiment because
I<00:03:05.510> don't<00:03:06.350> remember<00:03:06.500> when<00:03:06.770> I<00:03:06.800> when<00:03:07.340> I<00:03:07.370> bought

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
I don't remember when I when I bought

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.070 
I don't remember when I when I bought
either<00:03:07.820> of<00:03:08.090> these<00:03:08.210> so<00:03:08.480> I<00:03:08.510> don't<00:03:08.750> know<00:03:08.870> how<00:03:09.020> oh

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
either of these so I don't know how oh

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.540 
either of these so I don't know how oh
there<00:03:09.380> I<00:03:09.440> do<00:03:09.560> know<00:03:09.890> that<00:03:10.070> each<00:03:10.220> of<00:03:10.250> them<00:03:10.490> are

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
there I do know that each of them are

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.240 
there I do know that each of them are
several<00:03:11.060> years<00:03:11.360> old<00:03:11.630> so<00:03:12.380> they're<00:03:12.800> not<00:03:12.950> new

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
several years old so they're not new

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.350 
several years old so they're not new
bottles<00:03:13.700> but<00:03:14.570> I<00:03:14.930> did<00:03:15.350> see<00:03:15.620> a<00:03:15.650> difference<00:03:16.360> and

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
bottles but I did see a difference and

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.790 
bottles but I did see a difference and
like<00:03:17.540> I<00:03:17.630> said<00:03:17.690> I<00:03:17.840> preferred<00:03:18.320> the<00:03:18.500> fimo<00:03:18.770> gel

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
like I said I preferred the fimo gel

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.060 
like I said I preferred the fimo gel
just<00:03:19.310> because<00:03:19.640> it<00:03:20.090> made<00:03:20.330> it<00:03:20.450> more<00:03:21.110> of<00:03:21.170> an<00:03:21.860> oil

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
just because it made it more of an oil

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.850 
just because it made it more of an oil
cloth<00:03:22.430> feel<00:03:22.850> and<00:03:23.630> I<00:03:23.810> see<00:03:24.080> that<00:03:24.290> it's<00:03:24.440> a<00:03:24.560> little

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
cloth feel and I see that it's a little

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.820 
cloth feel and I see that it's a little
stiffer<00:03:25.160> and<00:03:25.760> it<00:03:26.750> just<00:03:26.990> I<00:03:27.230> think<00:03:27.350> I<00:03:27.590> can<00:03:27.740> do

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:27.830 
stiffer and it just I think I can do

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.710 
stiffer and it just I think I can do
more<00:03:28.100> with<00:03:28.220> that<00:03:28.250> but<00:03:28.700> I<00:03:28.910> can<00:03:29.330> see<00:03:29.540> it<00:03:29.630> on

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
more with that but I can see it on

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.360 
more with that but I can see it on
occasions<00:03:30.260> I'm<00:03:30.410> gonna<00:03:30.590> want<00:03:30.860> to<00:03:30.950> use<00:03:31.130> this

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
occasions I'm gonna want to use this

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.330 
occasions I'm gonna want to use this
liquid<00:03:31.850> sculpey<00:03:32.150> because<00:03:33.110> I<00:03:33.380> may<00:03:33.920> not<00:03:34.130> want

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
liquid sculpey because I may not want

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.510 
liquid sculpey because I may not want
something<00:03:34.550> so<00:03:34.820> heavy<00:03:35.120> you<00:03:35.570> know<00:03:36.470> or<00:03:36.770> with<00:03:37.489> a

going to do is you're going to create a

00:03:55.269 --> 00:04:01.750 
going to do is you're going to create a
fabric<00:03:56.890> soaked<00:03:58.150> liquid<00:03:59.150> clay<00:03:59.510> piece<00:04:00.170> and<00:04:00.950> I

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
fabric soaked liquid clay piece and I

wax good for handy because it's the

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:09.580 
wax good for handy because it's the
easiest<00:04:05.750> cleanup<00:04:06.170> you<00:04:06.440> can<00:04:06.620> find<00:04:06.970> and<00:04:08.590> you

easiest cleanup you can find and you

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.540 
easiest cleanup you can find and you
just<00:04:09.830> I<00:04:10.100> I<00:04:10.700> worked<00:04:10.970> with<00:04:11.600> the<00:04:11.870> lid<00:04:12.739> off<00:04:12.920> but<00:04:13.430> you

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550 
just I I worked with the lid off but you

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.430 
just I I worked with the lid off but you
can<00:04:13.700> use<00:04:13.880> the<00:04:14.030> squeeze<00:04:14.300> bottle<00:04:14.750> for<00:04:15.260> more

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
can use the squeeze bottle for more

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.400 
can use the squeeze bottle for more
control<00:04:15.860> actually<00:04:16.400> let's<00:04:17.060> do<00:04:17.299> that<00:04:17.480> for<00:04:17.989> these

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
control actually let's do that for these

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.870 
control actually let's do that for these
purposes<00:04:19.280> so<00:04:20.120> the<00:04:20.209> liquid<00:04:20.440> sculpey<00:04:21.580> it<00:04:22.580> just

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
purposes so the liquid sculpey it just

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.310 
purposes so the liquid sculpey it just
drips<00:04:23.120> out<00:04:23.330> and<00:04:23.600> what<00:04:23.690> you<00:04:23.810> want<00:04:23.960> to<00:04:24.020> do<00:04:24.080> is<00:04:24.230> you

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:24.320 
drips out and what you want to do is you

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:27.370 
drips out and what you want to do is you
start<00:04:24.590> with<00:04:24.710> a<00:04:24.830> little<00:04:25.040> there<00:04:25.340> on<00:04:26.350> right<00:04:27.350> on

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
start with a little there on right on

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.060 
start with a little there on right on
top<00:04:27.740> of<00:04:28.130> the<00:04:28.730> fabric<00:04:29.210> and<00:04:29.960> you<00:04:30.020> want<00:04:30.919> to<00:04:30.980> give

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
top of the fabric and you want to give

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.390 
top of the fabric and you want to give
your<00:04:31.190> breast<00:04:31.460> to<00:04:32.030> help<00:04:32.300> you<00:04:32.710> paint<00:04:33.710> it<00:04:33.890> on<00:04:34.040> and

your breast to help you paint it on and

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.370 
your breast to help you paint it on and
you<00:04:35.150> want<00:04:35.330> to<00:04:35.419> make<00:04:35.510> sure<00:04:35.539> that<00:04:35.810> it<00:04:35.930> gets<00:04:36.050> into

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
you want to make sure that it gets into

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.080 
you want to make sure that it gets into
all

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
all

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.409 
all
of<00:04:38.180> the<00:04:39.020> weave<00:04:39.230> of<00:04:39.650> the<00:04:39.800> fabric<00:04:40.430> so<00:04:41.120> you<00:04:41.180> don't

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:41.419 
of the weave of the fabric so you don't

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:42.850 
of the weave of the fabric so you don't
want<00:04:41.570> to<00:04:41.630> leave<00:04:41.750> a<00:04:41.780> little<00:04:41.990> spot<00:04:42.350> over<00:04:42.590> here

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
want to leave a little spot over here

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.860 
want to leave a little spot over here
because<00:04:43.190> it's<00:04:43.460> not<00:04:44.030> going<00:04:44.300> to<00:04:44.360> be<00:04:44.449> effective

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
because it's not going to be effective

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.710 
because it's not going to be effective
for<00:04:45.020> what<00:04:45.139> you<00:04:45.320> want<00:04:45.500> to<00:04:45.560> do<00:04:46.120> and<00:04:47.120> when<00:04:47.360> you<00:04:47.389> do

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
for what you want to do and when you do

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.510 
for what you want to do and when you do
this<00:04:47.900> you're<00:04:48.080> creating<00:04:48.560> a<00:04:48.800> totally

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
this you're creating a totally

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.560 
this you're creating a totally
waterproof<00:04:49.760> piece<00:04:50.570> of<00:04:50.750> fabric<00:04:50.990> now<00:04:51.550> so<00:04:52.570> you

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
waterproof piece of fabric now so you

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.020 
waterproof piece of fabric now so you
know<00:04:53.690> it's<00:04:53.930> it's<00:04:54.199> it's<00:04:54.530> you<00:04:55.460> go<00:04:55.610> puts<00:04:55.820> up<00:04:55.910> so

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
know it's it's it's you go puts up so

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:57.670 
know it's it's it's you go puts up so
many<00:04:56.120> options<00:04:56.419> so<00:04:56.840> that's<00:04:56.990> why<00:04:57.110> I<00:04:57.139> can't<00:04:57.440> stop

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
many options so that's why I can't stop

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.430 
many options so that's why I can't stop
saying<00:04:58.180> it's<00:04:59.180> just<00:04:59.360> a<00:04:59.510> cool<00:04:59.690> technique<00:05:00.169> so

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
saying it's just a cool technique so

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.620 
saying it's just a cool technique so
like<00:05:00.919> I<00:05:01.010> said<00:05:01.070> just<00:05:01.220> go<00:05:01.580> paint<00:05:02.030> an<00:05:02.180> even<00:05:02.419> coat

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
like I said just go paint an even coat

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:07.240 
like I said just go paint an even coat
of<00:05:03.520> the<00:05:04.520> liquid<00:05:05.260> sculpey<00:05:06.260> right<00:05:06.710> onto<00:05:07.220> your

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:07.250 
of the liquid sculpey right onto your

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:11.080 
of the liquid sculpey right onto your
fabric<00:05:08.240> and<00:05:08.740> you<00:05:09.740> would<00:05:10.310> do<00:05:10.430> it<00:05:10.460> with<00:05:10.639> the<00:05:10.760> fimo

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
fabric and you would do it with the fimo

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.090 
fabric and you would do it with the fimo
gel<00:05:11.120> the<00:05:11.990> same<00:05:12.229> way<00:05:12.410> but<00:05:12.590> let<00:05:12.710> me<00:05:12.770> show<00:05:12.889> you<00:05:12.950> the

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
gel the same way but let me show you the

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.659 
gel the same way but let me show you the
difference

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:13.669 
difference

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:16.060 
difference
you<00:05:13.940> saw<00:05:14.180> how<00:05:14.510> kind<00:05:14.960> of<00:05:15.050> watery<00:05:15.470> the<00:05:15.710> liquid

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:16.070 
you saw how kind of watery the liquid

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:18.340 
you saw how kind of watery the liquid
not<00:05:16.639> watery<00:05:17.090> that's<00:05:17.389> not<00:05:17.540> like<00:05:17.720> the<00:05:18.169> right

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.350 
not watery that's not like the right

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.129 
not watery that's not like the right
word<00:05:18.560> I'm<00:05:18.740> looking<00:05:19.010> for<00:05:19.040> but<00:05:19.310> it's<00:05:19.900> it's<00:05:20.900> a

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:21.139 
word I'm looking for but it's it's a

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:23.500 
word I'm looking for but it's it's a
thinner<00:05:21.470> consistency<00:05:22.090> that's<00:05:23.090> what<00:05:23.240> I<00:05:23.270> should

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.510 
thinner consistency that's what I should

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.629 
thinner consistency that's what I should
say<00:05:23.720> now<00:05:24.169> here<00:05:24.410> look<00:05:24.650> at<00:05:24.800> the<00:05:24.889> the<00:05:25.280> fimo<00:05:25.610> gel

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:25.639 
say now here look at the the fimo gel

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:30.840 
say now here look at the the fimo gel
that<00:05:26.210> I<00:05:26.270> had<00:05:26.510> and<00:05:27.290> it's<00:05:28.070> much<00:05:28.400> thicker<00:05:29.620> so

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:30.850 
that I had and it's much thicker so

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.719 
that I had and it's much thicker so
obviously<00:05:31.850> you<00:05:32.120> would<00:05:32.440> would<00:05:33.440> you<00:05:34.010> know<00:05:34.130> get

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:34.729 
obviously you would would you know get

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:37.330 
obviously you would would you know get
that<00:05:34.970> it's<00:05:35.900> sticker<00:05:36.350> so<00:05:36.830> it's<00:05:36.979> gonna<00:05:37.100> be

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
that it's sticker so it's gonna be

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:39.250 
that it's sticker so it's gonna be
thicker<00:05:37.940> on<00:05:38.300> the<00:05:38.419> fabric<00:05:38.810> and<00:05:38.930> create<00:05:39.110> a

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:39.260 
thicker on the fabric and create a

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:43.779 
thicker on the fabric and create a
thicker<00:05:39.760> type<00:05:40.760> of<00:05:41.289> material<00:05:42.639> which<00:05:43.639> I

00:05:43.779 --> 00:05:43.789 
thicker type of material which I

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:45.430 
thicker type of material which I
preferred<00:05:44.180> but<00:05:44.600> you<00:05:44.720> may<00:05:44.840> not<00:05:45.020> prefer<00:05:45.289> that

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:45.440 
preferred but you may not prefer that

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:46.990 
preferred but you may not prefer that
like<00:05:45.620> I<00:05:45.740> said<00:05:45.770> it<00:05:46.100> all<00:05:46.220> depends<00:05:46.729> on<00:05:46.820> the

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
like I said it all depends on the

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.080 
like I said it all depends on the
project<00:05:47.210> you're<00:05:47.539> doing<00:05:47.870> so<00:05:48.110> anyways<00:05:48.880> you<00:05:49.880> just

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.090 
project you're doing so anyways you just

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:51.820 
project you're doing so anyways you just
go<00:05:50.180> ahead<00:05:50.300> and<00:05:50.479> paint<00:05:51.139> it<00:05:51.260> on<00:05:51.320> with<00:05:51.530> the<00:05:51.620> brush

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:51.830 
go ahead and paint it on with the brush

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.710 
go ahead and paint it on with the brush
now<00:05:52.100> this<00:05:52.250> brush<00:05:52.550> you<00:05:52.729> want<00:05:52.850> to<00:05:53.000> dedicate<00:05:53.150> to

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:53.720 
now this brush you want to dedicate to

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.839 
now this brush you want to dedicate to
working<00:05:54.260> with<00:05:54.380> liquid<00:05:54.710> sculpey<00:05:55.220> or<00:05:55.520> liquid

00:05:55.839 --> 00:05:55.849 
working with liquid sculpey or liquid

00:05:55.849 --> 00:05:57.940 
working with liquid sculpey or liquid
your<00:05:55.970> fimo<00:05:56.300> gel<00:05:56.330> or<00:05:56.780> any<00:05:57.229> kind<00:05:57.380> of<00:05:57.410> liquid<00:05:57.590> clay

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:57.950 
your fimo gel or any kind of liquid clay

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:00.460 
your fimo gel or any kind of liquid clay
because<00:05:58.479> you're<00:05:59.479> never<00:05:59.599> gonna<00:05:59.720> get<00:06:00.020> all<00:06:00.139> of<00:06:00.349> it

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:00.470 
because you're never gonna get all of it

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.800 
because you're never gonna get all of it
off<00:06:00.620> so<00:06:01.280> make<00:06:01.460> sure<00:06:01.490> not<00:06:01.639> to<00:06:02.030> use<00:06:02.060> an<00:06:02.300> expensive

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:02.810 
off so make sure not to use an expensive

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.990 
off so make sure not to use an expensive
brush<00:06:03.020> when<00:06:03.229> doing<00:06:03.440> this<00:06:03.530> project<00:06:04.099> you<00:06:04.880> know

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000 
brush when doing this project you know

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.790 
brush when doing this project you know
have<00:06:05.180> fun<00:06:05.389> with<00:06:05.450> it<00:06:05.750> choose<00:06:05.990> areas<00:06:06.440> of<00:06:06.650> like

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 
have fun with it choose areas of like

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.190 
have fun with it choose areas of like
fabric<00:06:07.280> so<00:06:07.520> I<00:06:07.849> was<00:06:08.419> thinking<00:06:08.690> like<00:06:08.780> I<00:06:08.900> had<00:06:09.050> this

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:09.200 
fabric so I was thinking like I had this

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.070 
fabric so I was thinking like I had this
cat<00:06:09.560> fabric<00:06:10.099> so<00:06:10.280> why<00:06:10.430> not<00:06:10.610> cut<00:06:11.389> out<00:06:11.630> my<00:06:11.780> little

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080 
cat fabric so why not cut out my little

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.920 
cat fabric so why not cut out my little
cat<00:06:12.320> cover<00:06:13.190> him<00:06:13.610> then<00:06:14.419> add<00:06:14.599> maybe<00:06:14.840> some

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 
cat cover him then add maybe some
