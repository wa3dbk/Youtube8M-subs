 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.750
 new glitch video on gt5 online 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.060
 we update 1.15 to have a 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.590
 kind of torno hostile zone of tron 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.359
 as you have been many 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.500
 to have asked me so not 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.300
 start again slips I give you is 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.640
 just have like color crewe 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.390
 before all turquoise so it's between the 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.400
 blue and green 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.140
 and so my for those who do not know 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.850
 not really comment ben you have to 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.100
 simply be either the leader of a 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.579
 crew or otherwise that your neck to this 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.350
 color there 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.180
 so if you want to have the 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.440
 exact color I advise you to go 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.570
 in the description of the video 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.610
 you will find a link of a video 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.079
 to have secret colors thanks 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.340
 in the colors of costs and in this 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.809
 video I show you the color 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.219
 so that once you have to 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.570
 pretty much the turquoise color like 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.160
 color of crewe and well you go 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.899
 able to start the glitch on your 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.670
 cornea area which you will start 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.320
 not master of matte black as I 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.059
 shows in the video once you 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.620
 did that and marsala or the glitch goes 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.480
 start at you will simply have to 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.440
 to improve the category of paintings 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.510
 metallised 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.220
 you did not buy any painting 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.049
 just have to redo several 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.150
 times back to go to the menu 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.950
 main of los santos custom and you 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.540
 will simply have to change lighthouses 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.130
 of colors their children you did 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.750
 this and well forgot to see another one 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.259
 time you find yourself in the colors 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.180
 main 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.460
 you have the right this time 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.409
 go in the pearlescent category and a 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.600
 fault in this pearlescent category and 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.159
 despite I'm pretty much realize you 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.950
 just have to be like color 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.630
 green oil that a pretty turquoise glass 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.090
 is dark enough that have perfectly 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.710
 with vehicle and does not account caused 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.290
 well done that you have to put like 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.119
 secondary colors the color of croo 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.439
 so the turquoise color so at 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.210
 passage only for those who really 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.579
 the laziness of creating a master stroke 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.320
 this turquoise color like so many 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.420
 well then it hits you can also 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.110
 do it with the ultra blue but I 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.730
 think it's really 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.650
 much more beautiful with the colors of 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.090
 sure crusts headdress so for the spoiler 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.640
 I advise you to put the last 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.190
 it gives a more futuristic aspect to the 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.930
 zec tarnos and thereafter as red and 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.060
 Well, I strongly advise you to 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.619
 keep the wheels default because actually 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.820
 if you do not touch the eba 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.890
 normally through painting 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.330
 secondary that you will have to put as 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.300
 color to prove his say the 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:19.090
 turquoise and ben the outline of your wheels 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.920
 will also be in turquoise and that's it 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.230
 that will allow you to really have 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.840
 the tron ​​style and I think that's 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.920
 makes it really sucks endro beautiful 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.900
 so here I think I almost have 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.850
 right away for this audience what is 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.280
 really super simple and especially super 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.080
 nice to have a beautiful inferno 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.060
 really minutes that is really 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.650
 beautiful to see when it's dark because we 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.520
 looks like it's a little fluorescent 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.780
 in passing 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.150
 normally in the week or even 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.340
 maybe tomorrow I 'll put a video of 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.930
 glitch on black ops 2 in zombie mode 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.459
 normally and so here I think little 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.690
 after having said everything for this little glitch 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.250
