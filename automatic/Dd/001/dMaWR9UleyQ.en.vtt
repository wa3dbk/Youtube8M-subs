00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello friends and youtube subscribers in 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:08.220
 this video we will learn to elaborate a 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:11.519
 cube with wings like this well let's see 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.650
 how we do what we need is a 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.199
 square of paper and firstly what 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.360
 we will double through the diagonals of this 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.840
 side 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.490
 and from the other we unfold and we will give 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.330
 this triangle marked in the part 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:31.760
 lower getting on this side and this 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.760
 fold we will take it to the shore 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:38.109
 and we will mark in the center we will do what 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.109
 same from the other side 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:49.400
 and in the end we will have this figure 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:54.580
 well now we take the tips and the 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.580
 we will take to the top 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.760
 in this way 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:06.930
 well we turn and we will do the same with 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:08.790
 these other two points we will have good 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:13.280
 this figure now what we will do will be 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.280
 take the two points to the center 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.180
 and we will mark 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.130
 we will turn around and do the same 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.390
 on this side once the two are folded 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:31.170
 sides what we will do will unfold 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:35.300
 and we will remove the tip by folding the 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.730
 this brand that we have in this way 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:42.140
 and then what we will do 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:44.090
 lift the bottom and put this 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:48.890
 side 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:51.310
 in this way well and we will return to this 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.570
 backward tab 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.270
 bending the 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.420
 we will stay this way we will do what 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:03.560
 same with the other we take out we doubled by 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:07.540
 this for this brand we press in the 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.540
 lower part we will take it 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.710
 inward 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.370
 thus 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:23.550
 well and we fold back the tab 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:27.370
 flip we have and we will do the same with 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:30.210
 these two sides once finished 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.460
 we will have a figure like this 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:35.250
 fine and then what are we going to 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.670
 to do is to blow with great force 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.670
 this hole 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.829
 well and we will stay in this good way 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.930

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:49.299
