00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.460
 one before starting the video then I 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.949
 I think I'm going to say my nominees now 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.830
 so nominees are clock to pica and 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.029
 mobile and in third place as I've seen 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.800
 What a lot of people have done to you 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.449

 where you want you have everything in the 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.869
 description and little else to say we're going 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.189
 with the first envelope so under the 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.070
 first about to see if we have a little 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.079
 of luck and good we start with a medium 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.850
 ok let's see what they tell me are if 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.989
 we get a bit lucky if they see that 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.670
 I'm looking there is because I have a 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.430
 mobile typing I'm recording so 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.780
 let's see first middle place value 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.579
 of these is worth to start samu vale 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.489
 and leaving there I think it looks pretty 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.480
 While we have a goalkeeper for 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.089
 goalkeepers 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.420
 good good we started badly we started badly 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:02.940
 the truth is not touching anything nothing 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.519
 come on, this is it 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.619
 you have seen this in sight this is a 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.670
 Cuco is an athletic football that 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.540
 true that he is a player that I like 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.670
 quite as you see ay mikel rico ojo 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.810

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.990
 here 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.440
 more or less that you see them next is 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.490
 a medium 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:28.659
 a good death 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:31.970

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.150
 letters are super curred there was no 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:39.540
 ever seen this kind of letters and good 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.640
 in the last place 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.030
 these 2 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.450

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.979
 a medium 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.380
 for Juan Carlos is not bad for 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:54.560
 start to shear only for quique 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.460
 with a goalkeeper first letter in front of 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:01.000

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.480
 before seeing what to play in this 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.550
 about remember that you have to say to 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.860
 all these twitter kids that your 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.750

 When I 'm a Christian, I'm going to leave
