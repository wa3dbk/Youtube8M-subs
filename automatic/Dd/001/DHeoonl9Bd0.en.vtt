connectivity<00:00:05.520> was<00:00:05.970> really<00:00:06.359> for<00:00:06.569> a<00:00:06.600> long<00:00:06.810> time

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
connectivity was really for a long time

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.070 
connectivity was really for a long time
just<00:00:07.259> am/fm<00:00:08.189> radios<00:00:08.580> and<00:00:09.059> cassette<00:00:09.840> and<00:00:09.870> CD

just am/fm radios and cassette and CD

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.350 
just am/fm radios and cassette and CD
players<00:00:10.349> so<00:00:11.219> when<00:00:11.400> music<00:00:11.759> players<00:00:11.969> came<00:00:12.179> out

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
players so when music players came out

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.209 
players so when music players came out
when<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.660> ipod<00:00:13.200> was<00:00:13.410> introduced<00:00:13.830> at<00:00:14.009> other

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
when the ipod was introduced at other

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.550 
when the ipod was introduced at other
devices<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:15.120> car<00:00:15.330> companies<00:00:15.750> in<00:00:16.049> general<00:00:16.440> had

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
devices the car companies in general had

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.870 
devices the car companies in general had
to<00:00:16.650> figure<00:00:16.800> out<00:00:17.010> how<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.160> accommodate<00:00:17.760> those

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
to figure out how to accommodate those

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.340 
to figure out how to accommodate those
devices<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:18.570> bring<00:00:18.720> them<00:00:18.900> into<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.199> vehicle

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
devices and bring them into the vehicle

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.050 
devices and bring them into the vehicle
make<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.010> vehicle<00:00:20.310> an<00:00:20.369> extension<00:00:20.820> of<00:00:20.880> them

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
make the vehicle an extension of them

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.460 
make the vehicle an extension of them
that's<00:00:21.420> really<00:00:21.689> what<00:00:21.840> started<00:00:22.260> this

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
that's really what started this

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.710 
that's really what started this
connectivity<00:00:23.340> trend<00:00:23.789> it's<00:00:23.939> really<00:00:24.180> exploded

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
connectivity trend it's really exploded

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:33.630 
connectivity trend it's really exploded
over<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.019> last<00:00:25.199> few<00:00:25.410> years

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.910 

I<00:00:33.700> think<00:00:34.630> back<00:00:34.780> over<00:00:34.960> the<00:00:35.110> last<00:00:35.290> several<00:00:35.620> years

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
I think back over the last several years

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.410 
I think back over the last several years
there<00:00:36.370> was<00:00:36.430> a<00:00:36.520> recognition<00:00:36.730> that

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
there was a recognition that

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.420 
there was a recognition that
connectivity<00:00:38.170> is<00:00:38.440> going<00:00:38.620> to<00:00:38.680> be<00:00:38.770> important<00:00:39.220> I

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
connectivity is going to be important I

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.479 
connectivity is going to be important I
don't<00:00:39.790> think<00:00:39.850> anyone<00:00:40.540> back<00:00:41.200> in<00:00:41.530> let's<00:00:41.800> say<00:00:41.980> two

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:42.489 
don't think anyone back in let's say two

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:44.760 
don't think anyone back in let's say two
thousand<00:00:42.879> five<00:00:43.030> or<00:00:43.329> 2007<00:00:44.020> thought<00:00:44.559> that

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:44.770 
thousand five or 2007 thought that

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:45.930 
thousand five or 2007 thought that
connectivity<00:00:45.100> was<00:00:45.370> going<00:00:45.489> to<00:00:45.550> go<00:00:45.640> through<00:00:45.790> the

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
connectivity was going to go through the

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.090 
connectivity was going to go through the
growth<00:00:46.239> maybe<00:00:46.570> that<00:00:46.840> it<00:00:46.989> had<00:00:49.739> with<00:00:50.739> all<00:00:50.949> the

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 
growth maybe that it had with all the

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.740 
growth maybe that it had with all the
things<00:00:51.280> that<00:00:51.400> happened<00:00:51.670> to<00:00:51.730> GM<00:00:52.000> OnStar

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
things that happened to GM OnStar

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.240 
things that happened to GM OnStar
continued<00:00:53.140> to<00:00:53.230> flourish<00:00:53.410> we<00:00:53.800> launched<00:00:54.129> in

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
continued to flourish we launched in

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:55.950 
continued to flourish we launched in
China<00:00:54.489> in<00:00:54.699> late<00:00:54.910> two<00:00:55.089> thousand<00:00:55.480> nine<00:00:55.540> and<00:00:55.870> I

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
China in late two thousand nine and I

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.240 
China in late two thousand nine and I
think<00:00:56.170> that's<00:00:56.320> really<00:00:56.559> a<00:00:56.589> testament<00:00:56.800> to<00:00:57.100> the

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
think that's really a testament to the

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.310 
think that's really a testament to the
company<00:00:57.640> really<00:00:58.480> making<00:00:58.780> a<00:00:58.870> decision<00:00:59.140> that

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
company really making a decision that

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.619 
company really making a decision that
connectivity<00:01:00.220> is<00:01:00.489> a<00:01:00.519> key<00:01:00.790> part<00:01:01.089> of<00:01:01.300> the

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
connectivity is a key part of the

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:10.139 
connectivity is a key part of the
vehicle<00:01:07.350> it's<00:01:08.350> really<00:01:08.770> for<00:01:09.160> us<00:01:09.190> become<00:01:09.759> a<00:01:09.789> key

00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:10.149 
vehicle it's really for us become a key

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:12.840 
vehicle it's really for us become a key
attribute<00:01:10.539> of<00:01:11.110> the<00:01:11.170> car<00:01:11.470> that<00:01:11.890> makes<00:01:12.160> vehicle
