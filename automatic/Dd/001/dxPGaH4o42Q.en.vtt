00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.920 
come out understand maybe better
understanding<00:03:35.280> it<00:03:35.400> and<00:03:35.549> and<00:03:36.239> also<00:03:36.540> having<00:03:36.840> it

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
understanding it and and also having it

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.270 
understanding it and and also having it
closer<00:03:37.230> to<00:03:37.379> them<00:03:37.650> so<00:03:37.799> that<00:03:37.860> they<00:03:38.010> can<00:03:38.160> actually

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
closer to them so that they can actually

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.770 
closer to them so that they can actually
go<00:03:38.580> out<00:03:38.610> and<00:03:38.790> do<00:03:39.090> something<00:03:39.269> about<00:03:39.480> it<00:03:39.630> so

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
go out and do something about it so

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
so it's a different way of aid but you

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.880 
so it's a different way of aid but you
know<00:05:25.060> more<00:05:25.330> sustainable<00:05:25.840> and<00:05:25.930> really<00:05:26.260> you

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:26.890 
know more sustainable and really you

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.180 
know more sustainable and really you
want<00:05:27.540> you<00:05:28.540> know<00:05:28.660> the<00:05:28.780> people's<00:05:29.680> perception<00:05:30.130> of

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190 
want you know the people's perception of

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.280 
want you know the people's perception of
Africa<00:05:30.640> has<00:05:30.790> to<00:05:30.940> change<00:05:31.120> you<00:05:31.480> know<00:05:31.930> people's

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:32.290 
Africa has to change you know people's

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:33.780 
Africa has to change you know people's
procession<00:05:32.650> there's<00:05:32.890> a<00:05:32.950> lot<00:05:33.100> of<00:05:33.220> perception

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:33.790 
procession there's a lot of perception

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.940 
procession there's a lot of perception
that's<00:05:34.390> not<00:05:34.630> right<00:05:35.080> until<00:05:35.500> you<00:05:35.590> I<00:05:35.620> mean<00:05:35.800> you

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:35.950 
that's not right until you I mean you

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:37.320 
that's not right until you I mean you
working<00:05:36.160> and<00:05:36.550> you<00:05:36.670> know<00:05:36.790> you<00:05:36.850> went<00:05:37.090> to<00:05:37.120> mine

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:37.330 
working and you know you went to mine

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:38.940 
working and you know you went to mine
you<00:05:37.480> saw<00:05:37.660> but<00:05:37.780> when<00:05:38.170> you<00:05:38.260> were<00:05:38.320> there<00:05:38.620> is<00:05:38.800> when

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:38.950 
you saw but when you were there is when

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.980 
you saw but when you were there is when
you<00:05:39.040> understand<00:05:39.550> what<00:05:39.790> Africa<00:05:40.390> even<00:05:40.480> means<00:05:40.780> I

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
you understand what Africa even means I

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.960 
you understand what Africa even means I
think<00:05:41.170> from<00:05:41.320> afar<00:05:41.620> you<00:05:41.770> can't<00:05:42.040> and<00:05:42.340> there's<00:05:42.940> a

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:42.970 
think from afar you can't and there's a

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.450 
think from afar you can't and there's a
lot<00:05:43.150> of<00:05:43.530> bias<00:05:44.530> you<00:05:44.860> know<00:05:44.980> there's<00:05:45.160> just<00:05:45.220> so

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
lot of bias you know there's just so

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.140 
lot of bias you know there's just so
much<00:05:46.290> imagery<00:05:47.290> of<00:05:47.440> what<00:05:47.710> Africa<00:05:48.580> is<00:05:48.730> that<00:05:48.760> is

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150 
much imagery of what Africa is that is

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.120 
much imagery of what Africa is that is
necessarily<00:05:49.660> not<00:05:49.840> true<00:05:50.170> and<00:05:50.410> I<00:05:50.470> think<00:05:50.680> we<00:05:50.950> have

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.130 
necessarily not true and I think we have

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:54.150 
necessarily not true and I think we have
to<00:05:51.310> help<00:05:51.490> move<00:05:52.150> that<00:05:52.540> along<00:05:52.600> and<00:05:53.350> take<00:05:53.770> Africa

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:54.160 
to help move that along and take Africa

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.550 
to help move that along and take Africa
to<00:05:54.280> the<00:05:54.310> next<00:05:54.640> step<00:05:54.790> and<00:05:54.940> I<00:05:55.000> think<00:05:55.560> every

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 
to the next step and I think every

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.710 
to the next step and I think every
little<00:05:56.800> bit<00:05:56.980> helps<00:05:57.040> and<00:05:57.580> that's<00:05:58.240> kind<00:05:58.510> of<00:05:58.540> what

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 
little bit helps and that's kind of what

00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:59.930 
little bit helps and that's kind of what
I'm<00:05:58.810> hoping<00:05:58.990> you<00:05:59.620> know

00:05:59.930 --> 00:05:59.940 
I'm hoping you know

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:03.170 
I'm hoping you know
what<00:06:00.330> happened<00:06:00.660> in<00:06:00.720> Africa
