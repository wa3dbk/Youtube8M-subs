00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.160
 of beautiful you can do what you want 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.369

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.200
 son of a bitch the doll 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.060

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.870
 I demand to know what happens 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:04.030

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.030

 Well, it's crazy back but to see me 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.190

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.990
 of the enzyme of that and already binds alone 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.990
 so I leave it on top of this one 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:43.640
 because it does not join 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.480
 has worked command of red of which 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.480
 is with the tax 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:56.360
 a doll 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.360

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:09.410
 if they are shit between you 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.850
 and they pay a dollar for that and they do not pay 4 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.740
 dollars for the cattle that we give 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:18.340
 returns and in 2011 to everything else what 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.340
 I have in the bank 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:35.720
 but I think the bank they give you 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:38.459
 the robots with 500 dollars that cojones 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:41.459
 credit for a charitable purpose with the 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:44.569
 success for a charitable purpose with a 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.569
 future the future 

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:57.200

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:59.569

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.590
 400 euros then I would like very much 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:06.230
 win the contest and so 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:09.489
 not to bother my mother in all my years 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.489
 to charge me not 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:22.180
 and not having to pull the last name 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:26.549
 it would be pretty good which strategist 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.549
