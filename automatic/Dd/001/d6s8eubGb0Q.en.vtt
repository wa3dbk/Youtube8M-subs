essentially<00:00:39.120> these<00:00:40.110> have<00:00:40.350> been<00:00:40.469> around<00:00:40.739> for<00:00:40.980> a

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
essentially these have been around for a

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.639 
essentially these have been around for a
little<00:00:41.100> while<00:00:41.540> but<00:00:42.540> they've<00:00:43.230> been<00:00:43.440> available

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
little while but they've been available

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.160 
little while but they've been available
in<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.040> States<00:00:44.370> but<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.879> UK<00:00:45.300> peeps<00:00:45.600> decided

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
in the States but the UK peeps decided

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.260 
in the States but the UK peeps decided
not<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.129> bring<00:00:47.430> them<00:00:47.550> in<00:00:47.700> because<00:00:48.030> these

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
not to bring them in because these

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.200 
not to bring them in because these
rubber<00:00:49.020> corners<00:00:49.469> were<00:00:49.649> orange<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.910> it<00:00:51.000> kind

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
rubber corners were orange and it kind

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.569 
rubber corners were orange and it kind
of<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.570> stuck<00:00:51.960> out<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.170> bit<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.649> what<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.190> delay

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
of it stuck out a bit and what the delay

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.990 
of it stuck out a bit and what the delay
has<00:00:53.760> been<00:00:54.000> is<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:55.140> UK<00:00:55.590> been<00:00:56.430> waiting<00:00:56.789> for<00:00:56.940> the

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
has been is the UK been waiting for the

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.840 
has been is the UK been waiting for the
grommets<00:00:57.449> at<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.989> edges<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.980> be<00:00:59.010> black<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.760> it

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
grommets at the edges to be black and it

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.029 
grommets at the edges to be black and it
does<00:01:00.030> give<00:01:00.239> them<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.510> much<00:01:00.660> more<00:01:00.960> subtle<00:01:01.559> and

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
does give them a much more subtle and

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.880 
does give them a much more subtle and
kind<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.340> refined<00:01:03.329> an<00:01:03.570> almost<00:01:03.840> grown-up<00:01:04.559> look

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
kind of refined an almost grown-up look

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.340 
kind of refined an almost grown-up look
I<00:01:05.189> actually<00:01:06.119> quite<00:01:06.479> liked<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.689> now<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:07.110> can

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
I actually quite liked it now you can

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.480 
I actually quite liked it now you can
see<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.740> blades<00:01:07.979> in<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.220> middle<00:01:08.400> you

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
see that the blades in the middle you

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.969 
see that the blades in the middle you
can<00:01:08.580> see<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:08.880> you've<00:01:09.000> got<00:01:09.030> some<00:01:09.979> design

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
can see that you've got some design

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.429 
can see that you've got some design
around<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.060> outside<00:01:12.479> and<00:01:12.720> it's<00:01:12.869> round<00:01:13.110> here

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
around the outside and it's round here

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.440 
around the outside and it's round here
you<00:01:14.070> can<00:01:14.189> see<00:01:14.280> it's<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.490> bit<00:01:14.640> textured<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.330> you

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
you can see it's a bit textured and you

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.910 
you can see it's a bit textured and you
can<00:01:15.570> see<00:01:15.689> like<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.110> fins<00:01:16.409> on<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:16.830> almost

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
can see like the fins on it it almost

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.999 
can see like the fins on it it almost
looks<00:01:17.280> like<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.869> fish<00:01:18.869> fin<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.470> think<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:19.920> the

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
looks like a fish fin I think is the

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.530 
looks like a fish fin I think is the
best<00:01:20.189> way<00:01:20.369> I<00:01:20.400> can<00:01:20.610> explain<00:01:20.820> it<00:01:20.909> but<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.150> actually

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
best way I can explain it but I actually

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.260 
best way I can explain it but I actually
really<00:01:21.750> do<00:01:22.350> like<00:01:22.430> the<00:01:23.430> fact<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:23.790> there<00:01:24.090> are

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
really do like the fact that there are

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.149 
really do like the fact that there are
semi<00:01:24.600> opaque<00:01:24.930> they've<00:01:25.170> got<00:01:25.320> kind<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.680> smoked

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
semi opaque they've got kind of a smoked

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.460 
semi opaque they've got kind of a smoked
look<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.970> them<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.330> do<00:01:27.689> think<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.350> might

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
look to them I do think that it might

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.660 
look to them I do think that it might
have<00:01:28.530> been<00:01:28.710> nice<00:01:28.860> if<00:01:28.920> there<00:01:29.250> was<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.369> black

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
have been nice if there was a black

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.300 
have been nice if there was a black
sticker<00:01:30.150> or<00:01:30.500> something<00:01:31.500> over<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.860> front<00:01:32.100> so

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
sticker or something over the front so

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.609 
sticker or something over the front so
that<00:01:32.340> you<00:01:32.579> couldn't<00:01:33.030> see<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:34.079> windings

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
that you couldn't see the the windings

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.230 
that you couldn't see the the windings
of<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.860> motor<00:01:35.130> there<00:01:35.490> maybe<00:01:35.700> even<00:01:36.000> just<00:01:36.150> like

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
of the motor there maybe even just like

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.390 
of the motor there maybe even just like
a<00:01:36.299> gray<00:01:36.600> sticker<00:01:36.930> or<00:01:37.140> something<00:01:37.310> but<00:01:38.310> anyway

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
a gray sticker or something but anyway

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.580 
a gray sticker or something but anyway
so<00:01:39.119> we've<00:01:39.270> got<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.570> nice<00:01:39.900> design<00:01:40.290> but<00:01:40.560> you

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
so we've got that nice design but you

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.639 
so we've got that nice design but you
round<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.400> outside<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:41.850> can<00:01:42.000> see<00:01:42.090> this<00:01:42.240> ring

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:42.649 
round the outside you can see this ring

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:44.960 
round the outside you can see this ring
now<00:01:43.649> I<00:01:43.680> will<00:01:43.920> show<00:01:44.189> you<00:01:44.250> them<00:01:44.460> lit<00:01:44.610> up<00:01:44.759> but

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
now I will show you them lit up but

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.789 
now I will show you them lit up but
there<00:01:45.060> are<00:01:45.180> still<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.659> four<00:01:45.930> LEDs<00:01:46.409> that<00:01:46.439> you

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
there are still the four LEDs that you

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.090 
there are still the four LEDs that you
would<00:01:46.950> have<00:01:47.070> been<00:01:47.250> used<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:48.320> with<00:01:49.320> other<00:01:49.740> fans

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
would have been used to with other fans

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.940 
would have been used to with other fans
but<00:01:50.280> because<00:01:50.579> of<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:51.259> ring<00:01:52.259> around<00:01:52.530> the

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
but because of the ring around the

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.639 
but because of the ring around the
outside<00:01:52.979> this<00:01:53.759> does<00:01:54.149> help<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.079> light<00:01:55.409> it<00:01:55.619> up

outside this does help to light it up

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.420 
outside this does help to light it up
and<00:01:55.829> give<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.310> ring<00:01:56.610> fan<00:01:57.000> effect<00:01:57.450> now

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:58.430 
and give it the ring fan effect now

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.530 
and give it the ring fan effect now
something<00:01:59.430> quite<00:01:59.610> unique<00:01:59.640> about<00:02:00.090> this<00:02:00.299> is

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
something quite unique about this is

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.289 
something quite unique about this is
it's<00:02:01.170> got<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.380> little<00:02:01.469> switch<00:02:01.890> here<00:02:02.000> now<00:02:03.000> this

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
it's got a little switch here now this

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.289 
it's got a little switch here now this
switch<00:02:03.570> switches<00:02:04.290> you<00:02:04.500> between<00:02:04.920> at<00:02:05.759> thousand

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
switch switches you between at thousand

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.279 
switch switches you between at thousand
rpm<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:06.960> 600<00:02:07.799> rpm<00:02:08.119> with<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.330> our<00:02:09.509> switch<00:02:09.989> it

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
rpm and 600 rpm with that our switch it

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.760 
rpm and 600 rpm with that our switch it
takes<00:02:10.860> you<00:02:11.069> from<00:02:11.989> 46.3<00:02:12.989> CFM

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
takes you from 46.3 CFM

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.440 
takes you from 46.3 CFM
down<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.670> 20<00:02:14.820> 1.1<00:02:15.690> CFM<00:02:16.520> so<00:02:17.520> that's<00:02:18.210> the<00:02:18.300> two

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
down to 20 1.1 CFM so that's the two

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.330 
down to 20 1.1 CFM so that's the two
differences<00:02:18.750> but<00:02:18.990> normally<00:02:19.380> with<00:02:19.560> an<00:02:19.680> LED<00:02:19.860> fan

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
differences but normally with an LED fan

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.990 
differences but normally with an LED fan
when<00:02:20.580> you<00:02:20.670> switch<00:02:21.510> or<00:02:21.780> turn<00:02:22.320> them<00:02:22.560> down<00:02:23.000> the

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
when you switch or turn them down the

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.330 
when you switch or turn them down the
LEDs<00:02:24.480> would<00:02:24.720> get<00:02:24.960> duller<00:02:25.380> because<00:02:25.920> of<00:02:26.040> less

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
LEDs would get duller because of less

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.110 
LEDs would get duller because of less
power<00:02:26.850> going<00:02:27.600> into<00:02:28.260> the<00:02:28.620> fan<00:02:29.490> itself<00:02:29.850> but

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
power going into the fan itself but

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.470 
power going into the fan itself but
these<00:02:30.680> are<00:02:31.680> wired<00:02:31.980> differently<00:02:32.240> and<00:02:33.240> that

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
these are wired differently and that

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.390 
these are wired differently and that
even<00:02:33.780> though<00:02:33.900> you<00:02:33.960> still<00:02:34.290> got<00:02:34.410> a<00:02:34.440> normal<00:02:34.710> 3<00:02:35.130> pin

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
even though you still got a normal 3 pin

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.420 
even though you still got a normal 3 pin
which<00:02:35.640> is<00:02:35.820> all<00:02:35.970> flat<00:02:36.300> black<00:02:36.600> cables<00:02:37.340> when<00:02:38.340> you

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
which is all flat black cables when you

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.840 
which is all flat black cables when you
turn<00:02:38.610> it<00:02:38.730> down<00:02:38.820> at<00:02:39.030> 600<00:02:39.450> rpm<00:02:39.920> the<00:02:40.920> LED<00:02:41.460> stayed

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
turn it down at 600 rpm the LED stayed

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.640 
turn it down at 600 rpm the LED stayed
the<00:02:42.000> same<00:02:42.210> brightness<00:02:42.450> so<00:02:43.110> that's<00:02:43.290> brilliant

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
the same brightness so that's brilliant

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.100 
the same brightness so that's brilliant
because<00:02:43.950> obviously<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.760> LEDs<00:02:45.600> on<00:02:45.780> these<00:02:45.930> are

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
because obviously the LEDs on these are

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:47.210 
because obviously the LEDs on these are
part<00:02:46.350> of<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:46.590> reason<00:02:46.860> that<00:02:46.890> you<00:02:47.070> would<00:02:47.190> want

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
part of the reason that you would want

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.250 
part of the reason that you would want
them<00:02:47.520> I'm<00:02:48.450> probably<00:02:48.660> going<00:02:48.840> to<00:02:48.900> mean<00:02:49.050> the<00:02:49.080> main

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
them I'm probably going to mean the main

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.590 
them I'm probably going to mean the main
thing<00:02:49.290> anyway<00:02:49.860> so<00:02:50.610> they<00:02:50.730> come<00:02:50.880> in<00:02:51.030> blue<00:02:51.270> white

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.960

green<00:02:51.870> red<00:02:51.900> as<00:02:52.260> I<00:02:52.350> will<00:02:52.500> show<00:02:52.530> you

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
green red as I will show you

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.790 
green red as I will show you
you've<00:02:53.970> got<00:02:54.210> what<00:02:54.570> they<00:02:54.720> call<00:02:54.900> uniquely<00:02:55.560> and

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
you've got what they call uniquely and

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.630 
you've got what they call uniquely and
design<00:02:56.550> fan<00:02:56.910> blades<00:02:57.180> to<00:02:57.330> increase<00:02:57.960> airflow

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
design fan blades to increase airflow

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.090 
design fan blades to increase airflow
now<00:02:59.640> these<00:02:59.910> aren't<00:03:00.150> designed<00:03:00.570> to<00:03:00.780> be<00:03:01.100> radiator

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
now these aren't designed to be radiator

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.000 
now these aren't designed to be radiator
fans<00:03:02.430> there's<00:03:02.790> not<00:03:02.940> a<00:03:02.970> massive<00:03:03.240> amount<00:03:03.630> of

fans there's not a massive amount of

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.800 
fans there's not a massive amount of
static<00:03:05.010> pressure<00:03:05.360> but<00:03:06.360> I've<00:03:06.450> got<00:03:06.630> to<00:03:06.690> admit

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
static pressure but I've got to admit

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.840 
static pressure but I've got to admit
when<00:03:07.140> it<00:03:07.230> comes<00:03:07.440> to<00:03:07.620> fans<00:03:07.860> obviously

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
when it comes to fans obviously

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.820 
when it comes to fans obviously
sometimes<00:03:09.060> I<00:03:09.330> look<00:03:09.420> at<00:03:09.510> specs<00:03:09.840> but<00:03:10.590> a<00:03:10.650> lot<00:03:10.800> of

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
sometimes I look at specs but a lot of

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.740 
sometimes I look at specs but a lot of
the<00:03:11.010> time<00:03:11.220> it<00:03:11.820> is<00:03:11.940> actually<00:03:12.270> nice<00:03:12.420> just<00:03:12.690> to

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
the time it is actually nice just to

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.380 
the time it is actually nice just to
pick<00:03:12.930> a<00:03:12.960> fan<00:03:13.260> that<00:03:13.440> looks<00:03:13.770> pretty<00:03:14.160> and<00:03:14.820> because

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
pick a fan that looks pretty and because

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.360 
pick a fan that looks pretty and because
they<00:03:15.480> still<00:03:15.780> move<00:03:16.080> air<00:03:16.410> and<00:03:16.650> then<00:03:16.770> I<00:03:16.860> just<00:03:17.100> kind

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
they still move air and then I just kind

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.850 
they still move air and then I just kind
of<00:03:17.490> adjust<00:03:18.030> my<00:03:18.630> settings<00:03:18.690> around<00:03:19.500> it<00:03:19.709> now<00:03:19.830> I

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
of adjust my settings around it now I

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.190 
of adjust my settings around it now I
can<00:03:20.190> say<00:03:20.400> that<00:03:20.430> these<00:03:20.730> are<00:03:20.790> immensely<00:03:21.780> quiet

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
can say that these are immensely quiet

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.820 
can say that these are immensely quiet
on<00:03:22.440> both<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:23.700> 600<00:03:24.390> rpm<00:03:24.540> and<00:03:24.990> the<00:03:25.110> thousand<00:03:25.500> rpm

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
on both the 600 rpm and the thousand rpm

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.470 
on both the 600 rpm and the thousand rpm
they<00:03:26.010> don't<00:03:26.310> make<00:03:26.550> a<00:03:26.580> lot<00:03:26.760> of<00:03:27.000> noise<00:03:27.180> I<00:03:27.209> could

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
they don't make a lot of noise I could

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.050 
they don't make a lot of noise I could
hardly<00:03:27.930> tell<00:03:28.290> the<00:03:28.350> difference<00:03:28.860> between<00:03:29.130> 600

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
hardly tell the difference between 600

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.560 
hardly tell the difference between 600
and<00:03:30.090> then<00:03:30.240> going<00:03:30.510> up<00:03:30.630> to<00:03:31.260> a<00:03:31.290> thousand<00:03:32.570> but

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
and then going up to a thousand but

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.000 
and then going up to a thousand but
obviously<00:03:33.840> if<00:03:33.930> you<00:03:34.020> wanted<00:03:34.320> to<00:03:34.650> set<00:03:34.800> up<00:03:34.830> for

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
obviously if you wanted to set up for

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.000 
obviously if you wanted to set up for
extreme<00:03:35.490> quiet<00:03:35.760> you<00:03:35.910> can<00:03:36.090> use<00:03:36.270> that<00:03:36.450> switch<00:03:37.010> if

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
extreme quiet you can use that switch if

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.110 
extreme quiet you can use that switch if
you're<00:03:38.160> going<00:03:38.250> to<00:03:38.340> have<00:03:38.430> quite<00:03:38.670> a<00:03:38.700> complex

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
you're going to have quite a complex

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.550 
you're going to have quite a complex
system<00:03:39.390> or<00:03:39.660> a<00:03:39.690> lot<00:03:39.870> of<00:03:39.990> these<00:03:40.080> fans<00:03:40.350> you're

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
system or a lot of these fans you're

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.590 
system or a lot of these fans you're
probably<00:03:40.740> going<00:03:40.980> to<00:03:41.040> want<00:03:41.100> to<00:03:41.250> find<00:03:41.550> the<00:03:41.880> way

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
probably going to want to find the way

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.390 
probably going to want to find the way
that<00:03:42.780> you<00:03:42.870> want<00:03:43.050> them<00:03:43.110> and<00:03:43.380> fix<00:03:43.770> it<00:03:43.980> there<00:03:44.190> but

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
that you want them and fix it there but

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.610 
that you want them and fix it there but
you<00:03:44.490> can<00:03:44.820> still<00:03:45.240> if<00:03:45.450> you<00:03:45.600> want<00:03:45.840> play<00:03:46.380> around

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
you can still if you want play around

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.160 
you can still if you want play around
with<00:03:46.770> this<00:03:46.920> in<00:03:47.130> your<00:03:47.310> BIOS<00:03:47.670> settings<00:03:48.090> and<00:03:48.630> one

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
with this in your BIOS settings and one

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:51.830 
with this in your BIOS settings and one
of<00:03:49.230> the<00:03:49.320> things<00:03:49.470> that<00:03:49.620> it<00:03:49.770> does<00:03:50.010> come<00:03:50.310> with<00:03:50.840> is

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
of the things that it does come with is

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.070 
of the things that it does come with is
this<00:03:52.550> three<00:03:53.550> pin<00:03:53.790> two<00:03:54.000> molex<00:03:54.420> adapter<00:03:54.930> which

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
this three pin two molex adapter which

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.290 
this three pin two molex adapter which
even<00:03:55.350> daisy<00:03:55.530> chain<00:03:55.890> and<00:03:56.430> this<00:03:56.820> you<00:03:57.030> can<00:03:57.120> plug

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.300 
even daisy chain and this you can plug

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.880 
even daisy chain and this you can plug
into<00:03:57.480> your<00:03:57.570> motherboard<00:03:57.900> to<00:03:58.320> be<00:03:58.470> able<00:03:58.590> to

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
into your motherboard to be able to

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.510 
into your motherboard to be able to
monitor<00:03:59.070> the<00:03:59.310> RPM<00:03:59.790> if<00:03:59.970> you<00:04:00.060> wanted<00:04:00.950> but<00:04:01.950> I<00:04:01.980> do

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
monitor the RPM if you wanted but I do

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.610 
monitor the RPM if you wanted but I do
think<00:04:02.880> as<00:04:03.420> far<00:04:03.450> as<00:04:03.660> Amtech<00:04:04.110> is<00:04:04.260> concerned

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
think as far as Amtech is concerned

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
think as far as Amtech is concerned
there<00:04:04.740> I<00:04:04.770> think<00:04:04.890> you<00:04:05.130> could<00:04:05.250> have<00:04:05.340> made<00:04:05.490> those

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
there I think you could have made those

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.760 
there I think you could have made those
cables<00:04:06.060> black<00:04:06.330> so<00:04:07.140> it<00:04:07.410> would<00:04:07.560> have<00:04:07.650> been<00:04:07.740> a

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:07.770 
cables black so it would have been a

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.050 
cables black so it would have been a
little<00:04:07.980> bit<00:04:08.160> nice<00:04:08.340> or<00:04:08.610> something<00:04:08.760> there's<00:04:09.000> a

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
little bit nice or something there's a

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.510 
little bit nice or something there's a
very<00:04:09.240> minor<00:04:09.510> thing<00:04:09.950> we've<00:04:10.950> actually<00:04:11.130> been

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:11.520 
very minor thing we've actually been

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.930 
very minor thing we've actually been
using<00:04:11.820> this<00:04:12.180> to<00:04:12.720> do<00:04:13.650> the<00:04:13.830> light<00:04:14.100> display<00:04:14.700> which

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
using this to do the light display which

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.360 
using this to do the light display which
I'll<00:04:15.120> show<00:04:15.330> you<00:04:15.390> shortly<00:04:15.510> and<00:04:16.109> but<00:04:17.070> they<00:04:17.190> are

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
I'll show you shortly and but they are

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.650 
I'll show you shortly and but they are
all<00:04:17.609> of<00:04:17.760> them<00:04:17.880> are<00:04:18.000> available<00:04:18.450> at

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
all of them are available at

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.360 
all of them are available at
overclockers<00:04:19.290> now<00:04:19.440> and<00:04:19.709> like<00:04:19.830> I<00:04:19.950> said<00:04:20.130> they

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
overclockers now and like I said they

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.460 
overclockers now and like I said they
I'll<00:04:20.609> put<00:04:20.820> the<00:04:20.910> link<00:04:21.120> underneath<00:04:21.450> but<00:04:22.229> I<00:04:22.320> think

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
I'll put the link underneath but I think

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.170 
I'll put the link underneath but I think
it's<00:04:22.590> really<00:04:22.740> nice<00:04:22.979> that<00:04:23.010> they<00:04:23.280> waited<00:04:23.550> for

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
it's really nice that they waited for

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.969 
it's really nice that they waited for
the<00:04:24.510> black<00:04:24.840> grommets<00:04:25.260> rather<00:04:25.470> than<00:04:25.620> flooding

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
the black grommets rather than flooding

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:26.990 
the black grommets rather than flooding
the<00:04:26.070> market<00:04:26.430> with<00:04:26.460> orange

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
the market with orange

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.850 
the market with orange
and<00:04:27.720> then<00:04:27.840> changing<00:04:28.290> their<00:04:28.410> mind<00:04:28.620> halfway

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
and then changing their mind halfway

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.500 
and then changing their mind halfway
through<00:04:29.250> so<00:04:29.400> they<00:04:29.490> got<00:04:29.640> a<00:04:29.670> lot<00:04:29.850> of<00:04:29.880> plus<00:04:30.150> points

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
through so they got a lot of plus points

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:31.010 
through so they got a lot of plus points
for<00:04:30.690> that

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
for that

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.830 
for that
but<00:04:31.860> we<00:04:31.950> need<00:04:32.130> to<00:04:32.250> move<00:04:32.400> on<00:04:32.610> very<00:04:33.120> rapidly<00:04:33.570> so

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
but we need to move on very rapidly so

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.920 
but we need to move on very rapidly so
the<00:04:34.350> whole<00:04:34.770> point<00:04:35.130> about<00:04:35.250> these<00:04:35.610> fans<00:04:35.930> which

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
the whole point about these fans which

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.710 
the whole point about these fans which
is<00:04:36.960> lights<00:04:37.760> I'll<00:04:38.760> be<00:04:38.880> honest<00:04:39.150> with<00:04:39.240> you<00:04:39.360> peeps

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
is lights I'll be honest with you peeps

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.730 
is lights I'll be honest with you peeps
when<00:04:40.470> um<00:04:41.780> other<00:04:42.780> fans<00:04:43.170> have<00:04:43.350> been<00:04:43.470> released

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
when um other fans have been released

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.320 
when um other fans have been released
with<00:04:43.950> LEDs<00:04:44.400> that<00:04:44.610> I've<00:04:44.730> liked<00:04:45.000> that<00:04:45.150> weren't

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
with LEDs that I've liked that weren't

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.090 
with LEDs that I've liked that weren't

if<00:04:47.420> the<00:04:48.420> these<00:04:48.930> fans<00:04:49.350> fit<00:04:49.800> your<00:04:50.010> design<00:04:50.340> I

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
if the these fans fit your design I

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.910 
if the these fans fit your design I
would<00:04:51.060> just<00:04:51.240> run<00:04:51.510> with<00:04:51.690> it<00:04:51.750> unless<00:04:52.680> you're

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:52.920 
would just run with it unless you're

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.280 
would just run with it unless you're
looking<00:04:53.550> for<00:04:53.790> an<00:04:54.030> absolutely<00:04:54.570> screaming<00:04:54.990> are

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
looking for an absolutely screaming are

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.260 
looking for an absolutely screaming are

these<00:04:59.970> may<00:05:00.180> not<00:05:00.210> be<00:05:00.540> for<00:05:00.960> your<00:05:01.110> radiator<00:05:01.590> where

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
these may not be for your radiator where

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.020 
these may not be for your radiator where
they<00:05:01.770> could<00:05:01.919> be<00:05:01.980> perfect<00:05:02.490> for<00:05:02.550> your<00:05:02.790> case

they could be perfect for your case

they could be perfect for your case
obviously<00:05:03.540> we<00:05:04.020> spoke<00:05:04.260> about<00:05:04.290> our<00:05:04.830> performance

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:05.640 
obviously we spoke about our performance

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.820 
obviously we spoke about our performance
before<00:05:06.330> one<00:05:06.960> thing<00:05:07.110> I<00:05:07.169> would<00:05:07.350> say<00:05:07.500> though<00:05:07.530> is

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:07.830 
before one thing I would say though is

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.370 
before one thing I would say though is
sometimes<00:05:08.070> it<00:05:08.610> is<00:05:08.760> nicer<00:05:09.090> to<00:05:09.360> just<00:05:09.720> sacrifice

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
sometimes it is nicer to just sacrifice

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.370 
sometimes it is nicer to just sacrifice
a<00:05:10.410> few<00:05:10.740> degrees<00:05:11.240> with<00:05:12.240> it<00:05:12.360> on<00:05:12.480> a<00:05:12.510> heatsink<00:05:13.080> or

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
a few degrees with it on a heatsink or

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.680 
a few degrees with it on a heatsink or
an<00:05:13.620> i/o<00:05:13.890> or<00:05:14.220> something<00:05:14.669> like<00:05:14.790> that<00:05:14.850> just

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
an i/o or something like that just

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.840 
an i/o or something like that just
because<00:05:15.810> it's<00:05:16.230> going<00:05:16.410> to<00:05:16.530> look<00:05:16.950> really<00:05:17.280> really

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
because it's going to look really really

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.630 
because it's going to look really really
pretty<00:05:18.690> on<00:05:19.080> there<00:05:20.070> but<00:05:20.280> it's<00:05:20.400> obviously

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:20.640 
pretty on there but it's obviously

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.340 
pretty on there but it's obviously
something<00:05:20.820> that<00:05:21.090> you<00:05:21.210> can<00:05:21.480> decide<00:05:22.050> yourself

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
something that you can decide yourself

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:23.630 
something that you can decide yourself
I'm<00:05:22.500> certainly<00:05:22.860> not<00:05:22.980> going<00:05:23.160> to<00:05:23.220> mark<00:05:23.460> it<00:05:23.580> down

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:23.640 
I'm certainly not going to mark it down

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.450 
I'm certainly not going to mark it down
because<00:05:24.030> they<00:05:24.270> look<00:05:24.510> the<00:05:24.660> absolute<00:05:25.350> nuts<00:05:25.620> and

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
because they look the absolute nuts and

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:27.950 
because they look the absolute nuts and
they've<00:05:26.550> got<00:05:26.669> a<00:05:26.730> very<00:05:26.910> specific<00:05:27.150> task<00:05:27.630> maybe

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
they've got a very specific task maybe

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.330 
they've got a very specific task maybe
