for<00:00:41.730> Orchestra<00:00:42.730> which<00:00:43.329> I<00:00:43.480> was<00:00:43.629> very

interested and I've done I've done work
with<00:00:46.420> Orchestra<00:00:47.250> before<00:00:48.250> with<00:00:48.399> singers<00:00:48.760> and<00:00:49.390> I

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
with Orchestra before with singers and I

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.160 
with Orchestra before with singers and I
knew<00:00:50.980> that<00:00:51.010> she<00:00:51.309> wasn't<00:00:51.550> really<00:00:52.140> had<00:00:53.140> that

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
knew that she wasn't really had that

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.689 
knew that she wasn't really had that
kind<00:00:53.620> of<00:00:53.739> training<00:00:54.010> but<00:00:54.280> that<00:00:54.460> she<00:00:54.610> was

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:54.699 
kind of training but that she was

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:57.450 
kind of training but that she was
willing<00:00:54.879> to<00:00:55.239> make<00:00:56.079> that<00:00:56.109> effort<00:00:56.440> and<00:00:57.129> I

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
willing to make that effort and I

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.660 
willing to make that effort and I
thought<00:00:57.670> that<00:00:57.789> was<00:00:57.910> a<00:00:57.969> very<00:00:58.180> good<00:00:58.510> opportunity

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
thought that was a very good opportunity

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.369 
thought that was a very good opportunity
to<00:01:00.670> bring<00:01:00.879> her<00:01:01.149> kind<00:01:01.480> of<00:01:01.600> voice<00:01:01.809> into<00:01:02.260> the

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379 
to bring her kind of voice into the

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:08.040 
to bring her kind of voice into the
concert<00:01:02.739> hall<00:01:02.769> and<00:01:04.950> for<00:01:05.950> the<00:01:06.720> also<00:01:07.720> for<00:01:07.960> the

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
concert hall and for the also for the

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.419 
concert hall and for the also for the
concert<00:01:08.410> hall<00:01:08.440> to<00:01:08.679> have<00:01:08.830> that<00:01:09.009> kind<00:01:09.220> of<00:01:09.280> an

00:01:09.419 --> 00:01:09.429 
concert hall to have that kind of an

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:17.399 
concert hall to have that kind of an
artist<00:01:10.710> performing<00:01:11.710> which<00:01:11.920> would<00:01:12.190> be<00:01:12.340> unusual

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:17.409 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:20.190 

I<00:01:17.759> think<00:01:18.759> the<00:01:18.880> real<00:01:19.149> inspiration<00:01:19.960> for<00:01:20.109> the

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
I think the real inspiration for the

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.080 
I think the real inspiration for the
piece<00:01:20.350> itself<00:01:20.499> came<00:01:21.009> from<00:01:21.219> the<00:01:21.429> text<00:01:21.819> from<00:01:21.969> the

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
piece itself came from the text from the

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.319 
piece itself came from the text from the
word<00:01:22.270> such<00:01:22.630> he<00:01:22.810> had<00:01:22.929> chosen<00:01:23.200> oh<00:01:23.560> I<00:01:24.520> didn't

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:25.329 
word such he had chosen oh I didn't

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:26.760 
word such he had chosen oh I didn't
actually<00:01:25.450> know<00:01:25.780> what<00:01:25.990> language<00:01:26.200> it<00:01:26.469> would<00:01:26.590> be

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
actually know what language it would be

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.980 
actually know what language it would be
until<00:01:26.950> I<00:01:27.460> thought<00:01:28.359> it<00:01:28.509> was<00:01:28.569> going<00:01:28.810> to<00:01:28.869> be

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
until I thought it was going to be

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.480 
until I thought it was going to be
Swahili<00:01:29.409> if<00:01:29.469> it<00:01:29.560> turns<00:01:29.770> out<00:01:29.859> to<00:01:29.920> be<00:01:30.069> a<00:01:30.189> rule

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
Swahili if it turns out to be a rule

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.880 
Swahili if it turns out to be a rule
which<00:01:31.270> is<00:01:31.509> the<00:01:31.630> language<00:01:31.810> of<00:01:32.109> Benin<00:01:32.499> which<00:01:32.709> is

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
which is the language of Benin which is

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:37.440 
which is the language of Benin which is
the<00:01:33.069> country<00:01:33.399> she<00:01:33.520> comes<00:01:33.729> from<00:01:34.319> and<00:01:36.450> the

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
the country she comes from and the

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.830 
the country she comes from and the
interesting<00:01:37.539> thing<00:01:38.170> was<00:01:38.200> that<00:01:38.439> I<00:01:38.590> had<00:01:39.539> from<00:01:40.539> my

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
interesting thing was that I had from my

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.130 
interesting thing was that I had from my
visits<00:01:41.349> many<00:01:41.709> times<00:01:42.069> to<00:01:42.310> Brazil<00:01:42.759> I<00:01:43.140> knew

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:45.759 
something about their culture because

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:48.870 
something about their culture because
that'd<00:01:45.939> be<00:01:46.719> a<00:01:47.020> lot<00:01:47.289> that<00:01:47.679> Yoruba<00:01:48.310> culture<00:01:48.459> had

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
that'd be a lot that Yoruba culture had

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.160 
that'd be a lot that Yoruba culture had
gone<00:01:49.299> in<00:01:49.629> big<00:01:50.229> time<00:01:50.500> to<00:01:51.310> that<00:01:52.270> part<00:01:52.539> of<00:01:52.659> South

of<00:02:23.560> the<00:02:23.709> rhythm<00:02:23.920> and<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.459> phrasing<00:02:25.209> I<00:02:25.799> asked

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
of the rhythm and the phrasing I asked

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:30.330 
of the rhythm and the phrasing I asked
her<00:02:26.920> to<00:02:27.389> read<00:02:28.389> it<00:02:28.510> for<00:02:28.540> me<00:02:28.780> so<00:02:29.109> I<00:02:29.139> could<00:02:29.470> use

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
her to read it for me so I could use

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.479 
her to read it for me so I could use
that<00:02:30.459> as<00:02:30.519> a<00:02:30.670> basis<00:02:31.150> to<00:02:31.180> do<00:02:31.510> an<00:02:31.660> analysis<00:02:32.410> and<00:02:32.650> on

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
that as a basis to do an analysis and on

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.110 
that as a basis to do an analysis and on
the<00:02:33.609> big<00:02:33.819> on<00:02:34.060> with<00:02:34.630> that<00:02:34.840> as<00:02:35.430> the<00:02:36.430> background<00:02:36.669> I

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
the big on with that as the background I

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.520 
the big on with that as the background I
began<00:02:37.810> to<00:02:37.959> set<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:38.380> peace<00:02:38.650> a<00:02:40.169> vocal<00:02:41.169> piece<00:02:41.349> for

i wrote the vocal parts first and then

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.610 
i wrote the vocal parts first and then
did<00:03:22.299> the<00:03:22.329> orchestration<00:03:22.989> around<00:03:23.260> them

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
did the orchestration around them

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.750 
did the orchestration around them
I<00:03:25.409> knew<00:03:26.409> that<00:03:26.440> it<00:03:26.680> was<00:03:26.799> not<00:03:27.010> documented<00:03:27.370> that

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 
I knew that it was not documented that

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.320 
I knew that it was not documented that
you<00:03:27.940> will<00:03:28.090> be<00:03:28.180> familiar<00:03:28.330> with<00:03:28.950> because<00:03:29.950> uh

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
you will be familiar with because uh

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.619 
you will be familiar with because uh
it's<00:03:31.330> not<00:03:31.540> really<00:03:31.810> based<00:03:31.959> on<00:03:32.230> any<00:03:32.440> kind<00:03:32.680> of

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:33.629 
it's not really based on any kind of

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:37.460 
it's not really based on any kind of
indigenous<00:03:34.629> music<00:03:34.840> it's<00:03:35.739> really<00:03:36.040> based<00:03:36.250> on<00:03:36.430> my

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
indigenous music it's really based on my

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.690 
indigenous music it's really based on my
knowing<00:03:38.470> her<00:03:38.709> voice<00:03:38.890> which<00:03:39.159> I<00:03:39.280> knew<00:03:39.400> very<00:03:39.430> well

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
knowing her voice which I knew very well

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.360 
knowing her voice which I knew very well
and<00:03:40.120> knowing<00:03:41.079> what<00:03:41.200> it<00:03:41.319> would<00:03:41.440> sound<00:03:41.620> good

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
and knowing what it would sound good

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:48.119 
and knowing what it would sound good
with<00:03:42.549> it<00:03:42.849> was<00:03:42.970> the<00:03:43.090> orchestra<00:03:45.480> so<00:03:46.480> that<00:03:47.129> it

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:48.129 
with it was the orchestra so that it

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:49.979 
with it was the orchestra so that it
really<00:03:48.489> began<00:03:48.790> with<00:03:49.209> the<00:03:49.329> language<00:03:49.780> and<00:03:49.930> the

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
really began with the language and the

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.149 
really began with the language and the
idea<00:03:50.379> and<00:03:50.620> how<00:03:50.860> this<00:03:51.220> would<00:03:51.280> be<00:03:52.860> we<00:03:53.860> ended<00:03:54.069> up

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:54.159 
idea and how this would be we ended up

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:56.039 
idea and how this would be we ended up
with<00:03:54.310> three<00:03:54.430> pieces<00:03:54.730> three<00:03:55.209> songs<00:03:55.480> and<00:03:55.810> I

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
with three pieces three songs and I

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:58.770 
with three pieces three songs and I
probably<00:03:56.709> will<00:03:56.950> add<00:03:57.129> another<00:03:57.160> one<00:03:57.640> I<00:03:57.879> think

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
probably will add another one I think

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.380 
probably will add another one I think
you<00:03:58.900> could<00:03:59.079> use<00:03:59.109> one<00:03:59.410> more<00:04:00.000> but<00:04:01.000> for<00:04:01.209> right<00:04:01.359> now

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
you could use one more but for right now

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:06.800 
you could use one more but for right now
this<00:04:01.540> is<00:04:01.900> what<00:04:02.079> we've<00:04:02.500> done<00:04:02.709> oh<00:04:04.349> it<00:04:05.349> doesn't

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
this is what we've done oh it doesn't

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.479 
this is what we've done oh it doesn't
sound<00:04:07.810> African<00:04:08.349> it<00:04:08.470> doesn't<00:04:08.799> sound<00:04:08.920> European

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:09.489 
sound African it doesn't sound European

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:19.479 
sound African it doesn't sound European
it<00:04:09.700> sounds<00:04:10.560> well<00:04:12.480> something<00:04:13.480> else

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:25.600 

every<00:04:22.360> society<00:04:23.360> every<00:04:24.009> tradition<00:04:25.009> has<00:04:25.250> a

every society every tradition has a

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.379 
every society every tradition has a
story<00:04:26.569> about<00:04:26.720> how<00:04:27.110> the<00:04:27.169> world<00:04:27.470> begins<00:04:27.919> and<00:04:28.389> at

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
the same time there are very similar but

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.770 
the same time there are very similar but
they're<00:04:31.759> very<00:04:31.940> different<00:04:32.650> I<00:04:34.270> was<00:04:35.270> very<00:04:35.479> struck

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
they're very different I was very struck

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.999 
they're very different I was very struck
by<00:04:35.840> this<00:04:36.650> second<00:04:37.220> by<00:04:37.580> the<00:04:37.610> last<00:04:37.970> one<00:04:38.240> the

activity of this of the serpent that

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.800 
activity of this of the serpent that
begins<00:04:46.940> the<00:04:47.440> activity<00:04:48.440> of<00:04:48.530> the<00:04:48.680> world<00:04:48.889> but<00:04:49.550> uh

begins the activity of the world but uh

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.589 
begins the activity of the world but uh
it's<00:04:50.810> a<00:04:50.990> very<00:04:51.259> poor<00:04:51.530> take<00:04:51.770> our<00:04:52.039> way<00:04:53.000> of<00:04:53.240> talking

00:04:53.589 --> 00:04:53.599 
it's a very poor take our way of talking

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:55.990 
it's a very poor take our way of talking
about<00:04:53.780> beginnings<00:04:54.289> I<00:04:54.530> think<00:04:55.370> it's<00:04:55.520> important

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
about beginnings I think it's important

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.350 
about beginnings I think it's important
