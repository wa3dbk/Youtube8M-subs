 and the women's angels that are destined for sale in Spain and that we believe

 rare weird rare weird rare the game is a police thriller set in the 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:34.150
 year 1947 that tells the story of comcel January 5 and discounted the 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.780
 Second World War that has started a new life as a police officer 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.900
 the angels accident 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.550
 let's kill again 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.500

 the gameplay so that many might think we'll be a few seconds to 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.390
 style of the saga that has nothing further from reality 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.270
 since the angels sea places us in an open world its development 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.940
 is focused on the research genre being our task of 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.720
 to exercise of authentic policemen carrying their mechanics many more points 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.720
 in common with modern graphic adventures

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.710
 only reason 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.000
 for this he always proposes putting a series of cases that we have to solve 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.229
 had to make use of this building beginning of file x to find the 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:33.810

 I think with him

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.290
 mic indicates 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.400
 we will perform the same actions that a policeman would do in real life as 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.460
 for example look for clues at the crime scene a light looking objects 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.700
 of information by questioning witnesses and possible suspects 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.570
 etc 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.430
 being the player who decides when he has enough evidence to 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.970
 accuse the guilty 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.800
 the latter means that each user can move forward in the resolution of it 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.280
 crime differently according to the clues and evidence they have found 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.590
 commissioning the game a certain score at the end of each mission in 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.590
 where our effectiveness will be assessed when resolving if 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:25.510
 also a very important part as it is the use of this book of annotations already 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.949
 had they keep pointing to all the people we talked to the 

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:30.830
 Places we can visit areas 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.190
 sad is that we have discovered results from the very useful both to the 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.500
 time to mark our next destination as well as in interrogations 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.720
 where we can even distribute the testimony of a suspect if we want 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.720
 that are lying to us 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.619
 Saturday at least four now 

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:51.619
 please acz 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:59.060
 equal the whole country here arrived at this point it is necessary to clarify that between 

00:02:59.059 --> 00:03:00.489
 all are present 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.810
 our work as a systematic detective that there are also some 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.680
 punctual moments of action where we will see using violence and toned 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.629
 immersed in shootings and close combat or even being part of 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:14.879
 police chases both on foot and driving a vehicle 

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:19.559
 In addition, although as good advocates of the law, we do not have any 

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:23.349
 instant of free will to harm the innocent or do evil if we can 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:26.669
 do pretty fun things taking advantage of our license plate 

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:30.349
 police as for example to confiscate whenever we want the car of 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:33.349
 any citizen without them being able to refuse 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:39.659
 from there we started the sector 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:44.259
 there is no excuse to pursue its fortea varieties 

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:48.089
 we also have to mention that as we go about solving crimes we will go 

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:51.729
 extending rank in the police conscious in this way that they are 

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:54.729
 assign more important cases even that also to this department 

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:59.379
 after exercising for a while as a simple agent that we have promoted 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:03.449
 it's something later the traffic department the homicide experiment 

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:06.959
 beginnings where we will leave aside our uniform to go to work 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.399
 jar dressed in suit and tie 

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:12.409
 the facts 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:13.599
 that's why yesterday 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:17.429
 title nothing the same way another detail to comment is that although the development 

00:04:17.429 --> 00:04:21.389
 of the game is totally linear when it comes to the main missions and 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:24.959
 we are attentive to the calls of the police station we can accept 

00:04:24.959 --> 00:04:28.409
 voluntarily on many more occasional missions 

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:31.839
 you also have to add several secrets that we will find scattered throughout the 

00:04:31.839 --> 00:04:35.679
 city ​​had the power to unlock new routes for our protagonist both 

00:04:35.679 --> 00:04:39.059
 all this something more variety to the game I understand a gameplay 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:43.610
 Clear 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.340
 happening and encourage the graphic section the atmosphere of the pop was 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.199
 sensational as well as the fantastic recreation of the itata of the city of 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:55.039
 the angels of the 40s tend to feel at all times like 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:58.240
 the protagonists of an authentic children's movie 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.990
 in addition a rather curious detail that has caught our attention is the 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.789
 fact that if we want it we can play in black and white so that this 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:09.720
 way its aesthetic resembles more that of a crop film of the 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.720
 time 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:20.380
 although there is something for which the title stands out in this sense is for the 

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:24.449
 incredible facial animation of the characters having these a level of 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:28.370
 absolutely amazing detail that we had never seen before 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.530
 white equipment facts to preserve the faces of the suspects was one of the ways to 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.520
 include if these customers all this will be possible thanks to a new 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.669
 technology called Kannapolis women able to show us each 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:44.280
 small gesture and martyr that the face taken as a base captures made 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.280
 authentic actors of flesh and bone 

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:50.849
 Act 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:52.659
 now everything is a lawyer 

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:54.169
 there will be many 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:58.289
 finally the sound section meets the same good level of nintendoes with 

00:05:58.289 --> 00:06:02.029
 melodies of the interests of the time the company at this time in 

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:03.409
 the one that the parties 

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:07.699
 although these are only in English conforming us once more 

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:11.190
 in a rock star title is to get all the dialogues through the 

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:14.189
 habitual subtitles in Spanish 

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:20.620
 in short the angels dies their game of great quality and with a 

00:06:20.619 --> 00:06:24.339
 very innovative gameplay that what stand out from everything seen until the 

00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:27.819
 moment in the genre of adventures getting on court and fun 

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:30.009
 player from the first minute 

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:33.719

 will be taken from now on as a reference to follow for other great 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.860
 titles in the economic future 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.860
 also the chain eki 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:50.069
 as well as the bird of Barcelona 

00:06:50.069 --> 00:06:53.069
 date 

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:56.379
 the cavalcade 

00:06:56.379 --> 00:06:57.460
 with power 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:58.840
 that's why he advocates promoting
