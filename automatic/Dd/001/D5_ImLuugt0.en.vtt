00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.869 

every<00:02:12.959> year<00:02:13.170> was<00:02:13.290> more<00:02:13.500> difficult<00:02:14.400> and<00:02:14.760> more

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
every year was more difficult and more

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.970 
every year was more difficult and more
tighten<00:02:15.239> between<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.689> riders<00:02:16.590> they're

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
tighten between the riders they're

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.210 
tighten between the riders they're
always<00:02:17.970> more<00:02:18.269> competitive<00:02:18.780> and<00:02:19.220> that's

always more competitive and that's

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.539 
always more competitive and that's
proportional<00:02:20.730> every<00:02:21.209> year<00:02:21.420> we<00:02:22.140> have<00:02:22.260> more

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:22.549 
proportional every year we have more

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:26.509 
proportional every year we have more
difficult<00:02:23.549> to<00:02:23.730> know<00:02:24.629> the<00:02:24.689> right<00:02:25.200> ones<00:02:25.470> this<00:02:26.459> is

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
difficult to know the right ones this is

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.270
