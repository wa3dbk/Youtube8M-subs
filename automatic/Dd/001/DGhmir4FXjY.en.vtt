symbols that have to buy two lots of
double<00:00:50.760> symbol<00:00:51.270> sets<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:52.530> in<00:00:52.710> game<00:00:52.920> there's<00:00:53.219> a

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
double symbol sets so in game there's a

signed in hit start go to options drum
options<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.600> then<00:01:04.379> you<00:01:04.650> can<00:01:04.799> see<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.070> three

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
options and then you can see the three

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.730 
options and then you can see the three
choices<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.060> symbols<00:01:06.450> there<00:01:06.750> were<00:01:07.080> next

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
choices of the symbols there were next

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.640 
choices of the symbols there were next
to<00:01:07.770> check<00:01:08.040> boxes<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:09.330> just<00:01:09.689> tick<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.409> ones

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
to check boxes so just tick the ones

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.020 
to check boxes so just tick the ones
you're<00:01:10.830> currently<00:01:11.159> using<00:01:11.220> make<00:01:11.760> sure<00:01:11.880> they're

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
you're currently using make sure they're

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.609 
you're currently using make sure they're
plugged<00:01:12.240> into<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.510> correct<00:01:12.840> ports<00:01:13.350> on<00:01:13.500> the

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
plugged into the correct ports on the

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.010 
plugged into the correct ports on the
back<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:14.280> then<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.549> will<00:01:14.640> drop<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.090> symbols

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
back and then it will drop the symbols

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.570 
back and then it will drop the symbols
of<00:01:16.200> those<00:01:16.380> colors<00:01:16.799> that<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.009> haven't<00:01:17.310> ticked

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
of those colors that you haven't ticked

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.969 
of those colors that you haven't ticked
in<00:01:17.790> Pro<00:01:18.119> Mode<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:19.290> I'll<00:01:19.380> see<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.650> way<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.799> have

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
in Pro Mode so I'll see the way to have

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.260 
in Pro Mode so I'll see the way to have
the<00:01:20.070> three<00:01:20.280> symbols<00:01:20.549> so<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:20.939> can<00:01:21.060> get<00:01:21.119> the

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
the three symbols so you can get the

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.539 
the three symbols so you can get the
full<00:01:21.540> experience<00:01:22.170> but<00:01:22.890> if<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.130> don't<00:01:23.310> want<00:01:23.490> to

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
full experience but if you don't want to

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.690 
full experience but if you don't want to
shell<00:01:23.700> out<00:01:23.729> on<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.470> another<00:01:25.470> symbol<00:01:26.130> set<00:01:26.490> and

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
shell out on a another symbol set and

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.490 
shell out on a another symbol set and
have<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:26.850> symbol<00:01:27.240> left<00:01:27.390> over<00:01:27.780> then<00:01:28.049> this<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.470> a

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
have a symbol left over then this is a

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.810 
have a symbol left over then this is a
pretty<00:01:28.770> good<00:01:28.950> work<00:01:29.100> around<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:29.520> doesn't

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
pretty good work around it doesn't

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.330 
pretty good work around it doesn't
affect<00:01:30.170> the<00:01:31.170> career<00:01:31.500> process<00:01:32.070> or<00:01:32.310> the

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
affect the career process or the

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.649 
affect the career process or the
achievements<00:01:33.000> or<00:01:33.060> anything<00:01:33.329> like<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.479> so

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
achievements or anything like that so

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.350 
achievements or anything like that so
you<00:01:33.869> can<00:01:34.020> still<00:01:34.430> fully<00:01:35.430> had<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.150> game

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
you can still fully had the the game

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.630 
you can still fully had the the game
experience<00:01:36.930> just<00:01:37.770> you'll<00:01:37.950> have<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.280> account

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
experience just you'll have to account

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.910 
experience just you'll have to account
for<00:01:38.990> one<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.140> symbols<00:01:40.320> being<00:01:40.619> gone<00:01:40.890> and
