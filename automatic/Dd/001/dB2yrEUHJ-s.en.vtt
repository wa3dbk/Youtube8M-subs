00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.219
 Carolina Rodriguez is the best example 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.240
 with effort illusion that the word 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:12.970
 impossible does not exist 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:14.530
 Carolina is 29 years old and if she gets 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.450
 qualify for the Olympic Games 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.640
 of river will be the Olympic gymnast more 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:21.340
 Veteran of history with the look 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.050
 putting the 2016 River Olympics now 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.150
 its objective is focused on classifying 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.369
 among the 15 best gymnasts in the world 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.759
 in the championship to study the next 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:29.759
 month of September 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.620
 well the truth is that the intensity of 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.640
 a world type type games competition 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.700
 olympics 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.110
 it's hard because you're there and you have 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.480
 a responsibility represent your 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.370
 country but perhaps where more pressed me 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.160
 Spain feel is in the changing of 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.540
 Spain is very hard to have a lot of 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.130
 eyes that are watching you yes that 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.280
 you really have the responsibility of 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:57.500
 keep your position your number one and 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.600
 there are many critics worldwide 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.570
 not because there are so many people and 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.699
 you go then if you go with that 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.730
 responsibility but you're going to enjoy it and 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.990
 well, the tension of an Olympiad 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.580
 It is not the same as a world cup 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.380
 because in a world in this case you 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.080
 you have to classify the games and there 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.340
 there's going to be a lot of pressure and in a 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.200
 Olympiad is totally everything 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.640
 otherwise you get there and enjoy 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.070
 really be able to be there because in a 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.840
 global go two hundred girls and in one 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.200
 olympics, there are only 20 that are 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.200
 chosen 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.429
 I'm doing what I like then 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.130
 I only think about training and trying 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:37.140
 surpass me day after day but yes that is 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.299
 true that good for me is everything 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.799
 It's a challenge to get to games 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.500
 Olympians with 30 years because none 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.860
 gymnast has achieved it and simply 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.660
 I try to enjoy the day to day 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.910
 the sensations that I have came from faces 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.880
 of world are very good because I'm 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.830
 at a stage of my sports career 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.990
 I think the best one I'm enjoying 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.320
 of each competition every time I notice that I 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.490
 there are fewer competitions and therefore 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.340
 in another I notice in very good shape 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.700
 physical and wanting to come to train 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:11.620
 every day and more then well then 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:14.630
 I think we can make a good paper that 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.900
 it's probably my last World Cup and 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.810
 I'm going to eat the world because it's very 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.750
 atypical that a gymnast is so old and 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.700
 follow in the high competition but I think 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.610
 that the secret is that they were born 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.050
 to do this sport has the 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.350
 the qualities that have a 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.450
 high level athlete and especially his 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.090
 love of rhythm that's what many 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.900
 Sometimes he says it 's how he can get to 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:45.210
 support both rhythmic and it 's because you 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.810
 comes out from inside because a year ago I was 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:50.970
 for withdrawal because he had in mind that 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.150
 in May of last year when you finish the 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:57.000
 European was going to end gymnastics and 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:59.610
 definitely finally and good then to 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.590
 final I was lucky that a door 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.140
 I opened a door called drag 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.510
 sandwich 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.110
 and they supported me from minute 1 yo 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:11.170
 I got there without knowing anyone 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:13.900
 without them practically knowing me and 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.240
 in since minute one then they gave me 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.460
 all facilities for that for 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.500
 fulfill my dream and then it was 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:23.530
 the engine that prompted me to say come 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:26.140
 now you enjoy gymnastics, you 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.490
 you can and continue with it and until the 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.450
 today I feel super 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.450
 satisfied and happy 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:38.060
 some very positive feelings maybe 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:41.030
 more than I thought I did some 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:44.620
 time because we have had there 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.620
 setbacks with injuries 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:50.370
 has a body composition 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.590
 very very much like its best 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.210
 last year and I really have some 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.680
 very positive feelings from the 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.920
 physical appearance and from the mental aspect 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.920
 as well 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:07.450
 Well, my great dream 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.209
 I think it's the olympic games I sleep 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.680
 and I wake up every day thinking about it 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.000
 maybe good because it's the 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.329
 most beautiful competition for a 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.430
 athlete but above all because it is what 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.980
 only to which I aspire has already been in 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.990
 all the competitions that exist 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:25.230
 world games singers universities 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.000
 of the world championship of europe 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.449
 I think I have nothing left to watch games 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.249
 European 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:33.400
 and the Olympiad has nothing to do 

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:35.110
 then that is my dream to be able to be 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.110
 there that if I do not get it good then 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.210
 I would be very angry but I have done 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.159
 all for gymnastics and gymnastics me has 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.830
 given many things then simply 

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:47.759
 I'm going to fight it and I hope I can be 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.759
 in river 2016
