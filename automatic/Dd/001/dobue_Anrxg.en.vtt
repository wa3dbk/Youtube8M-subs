00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
were forced to migrate in the most

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.960 
were forced to migrate in the most
dangerous<00:01:09.500> sections<00:01:10.040> of<00:01:10.220> the<00:01:10.340> border<00:01:10.729> as<00:01:10.940> a

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
dangerous sections of the border as a

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:11.830 
dangerous sections of the border as a
deterrent

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
deterrent

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.560 
deterrent
however<00:01:12.619> NAFTA<00:01:13.280> continued<00:01:13.880> the<00:01:14.090> poverty

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
however NAFTA continued the poverty

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.109 
however NAFTA continued the poverty
escalated<00:01:15.320> in<00:01:15.500> in<00:01:15.799> Mexico<00:01:16.430> and<00:01:16.640> so<00:01:16.760> people

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
escalated in in Mexico and so people

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.120 
escalated in in Mexico and so people
weren't<00:01:17.299> deterred<00:01:17.780> they<00:01:18.409> were<00:01:18.470> forced<00:01:19.010> to

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
weren't deterred they were forced to

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:31.920 
weren't deterred they were forced to
migrate<00:01:19.400> in<00:01:19.790> even<00:01:20.030> harsher<00:01:20.270> conditions

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.070 

maybe<00:01:32.590> they<00:01:32.740> used<00:01:33.010> to<00:01:33.190> call<00:01:33.400> the<00:01:34.270> dust<00:01:34.510> migrant

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
maybe they used to call the dust migrant

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.560 
maybe they used to call the dust migrant
deaths<00:01:35.550> until<00:01:36.550> we<00:01:36.640> realized<00:01:37.000> that<00:01:37.090> we<00:01:37.240> have<00:01:37.390> no

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
deaths until we realized that we have no

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.210 
deaths until we realized that we have no
idea<00:01:37.870> when<00:01:38.080> or<00:01:38.380> how<00:01:38.530> many<00:01:38.590> people<00:01:38.950> are<00:01:39.010> dying

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
idea when or how many people are dying

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.850 
idea when or how many people are dying
so<00:01:40.060> then<00:01:40.300> we<00:01:40.450> can<00:01:40.600> only<00:01:40.720> talk<00:01:40.960> about<00:01:41.290> what's

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
so then we can only talk about what's

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.130 
so then we can only talk about what's
been<00:01:42.010> recovered<00:01:42.550> so<00:01:42.940> we<00:01:43.060> call<00:01:43.270> them<00:01:43.510> recovered

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
been recovered so we call them recovered

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.710 
been recovered so we call them recovered
bodies<00:01:44.500> and<00:01:44.830> then<00:01:45.400> they<00:01:45.520> realized<00:01:45.940> in<00:01:46.150> Arizona

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
bodies and then they realized in Arizona

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.080 
bodies and then they realized in Arizona
you're<00:01:47.590> not<00:01:47.800> usually<00:01:48.220> a<00:01:48.250> body<00:01:48.610> is<00:01:48.850> the<00:01:48.910> most
