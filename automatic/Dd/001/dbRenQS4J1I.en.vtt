00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:06.180
 be careful now it will be terrible 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.010
 silly but so oblique that everything 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.210
 The game behind it is red 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.210
 had zocker costly 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.739
 hello bayonetta also in the second part of the 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.329
 series in the autumn exclusively for wii u 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.030
 available again we control the 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.620
 strong fighting witch in skintight costume and 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.850
 with weapons on hands and feet 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.040
 this time it's all about bayonetta 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.870
 girlfriend ginny of an unnecessary that 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.030
 and she is killed in our fight 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.100
 actually uses witch as a special attack 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.670
 how can bayonetta gene out of the eternal 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.560
 save damnation 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.820
 what's up with the mysterious 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.770
 masked ways of looking into the 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.390
 events and what is involved 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.890
 Let's do it with our snappy demons 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.119
 construction 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.990
 the latter question we answer with one 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.580
 spanking 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.960
 the others send us in 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.960
 spectacular adventure 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.560
 although so spectacular awesome that 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.909
 do not play in all areas of the five 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.219
 chapter comprehensive preview version 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.840
 In addition to fighting against angelic armies and 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:37.420
 We explore huge bosses opponents 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.640
 also various scenes and the see 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.619
 so without a crazy bridge spectacle 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.240
 pretty drab and dull 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.459
 After all, there is much to discover 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.740
 treasure hidden challenges 

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:49.840
 Bonus old and massive notes 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:54.700
 the currency in the game we for new 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.140
 Attack items and costumes and spend 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.000
 so that we have it behind us right away 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.289
 next weakness of the game while it is 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.670
 some cool staged 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:02.649
 between sequences is the story 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.259
 often by such image sequences 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.030
 tells that is boring on top of that 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.979
 are the frequently driven Klamauk 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.709
 as well as the bizarre characters certainly 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.299
 a matter of taste 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:16.180
 but now enough bitchy purely in the 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:18.700
 next fight does not see that close 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.650
 much better in the fleets 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.209
 fight the game blooms downright 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.879
 and sometimes it does 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:27.190
 how the pure chaos is the action 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:30.130
 always well controlled and better 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.360
 yet it offers plenty of play deep 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.880
 numerous combos a demanding one 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.710
 evasive system various weapons 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.050
 motivating ranking system and gorgeous 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.370
 failed opponents like his predecessor 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.770
 handicapped two has a great 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.330
 learning curve first you still come with 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:46.340
 button mashing is still fighting for 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.930
 You will be driven to a more tactical fight 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.610
 and to pay more thoughtfully 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.590
 this is also thanks to the famous 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.590
 staging is not boring 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:58.920
 certainly not if the numerous 

00:02:55.719 --> 00:03:01.329
 between and finalists have occurred in 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.340
 There are such huge opponents in Bavaria 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:06.249
 about two times as explosions in 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.170
 make a call of duty again and again 

00:03:06.249 --> 00:03:10.150
 us big demons or colossal 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.170
 Angel in the way and then turn the 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.170
 Developers really happy 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.859
 the staging of this fight is 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.389
 everything in the shade what in other corner 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:21.189
 to play as a final france opponent 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:22.780
 is shown and not forgotten 

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:25.680
 everything we show here comes from 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.680
 the beginning of the game 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:43.840
 Yes 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.700
 bayonetta 2 fully relies on the strengths 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.500
 his predecessor spectacular 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.450
 staged demanding and good 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.240
 controllable action the whole 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.740
 around it acts so far rather appropriate 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:56.080
 but it does not spoil the fun at the game 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.580
 curious to know whether the rest of Barnetta 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.890
 2 of the high fun of playing level 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.690
 preview version can and will be 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.640
 but with the story path they will become 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:07.740
 So far , we have plenty of kite 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.740
 hot witch or not
