00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
on a kick about global cooling hey hey

what scientist out there said humans

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.599 
what scientist out there said humans
made<00:01:26.159> ice<00:01:26.640> ages<00:01:27.740> while<00:01:28.740> I<00:01:28.799> was<00:01:29.159> there<00:01:30.109> and

00:01:31.599 --> 00:01:31.609 
made ice ages while I was there and

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:36.379 
made ice ages while I was there and
amazingly<00:01:34.969> California<00:01:35.969> was<00:01:36.060> having

00:01:36.379 --> 00:01:36.389 
amazingly California was having

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:39.349 
amazingly California was having
financial<00:01:36.509> trouble<00:01:37.229> back<00:01:37.409> man<00:01:37.710> yeah<00:01:38.359> crazy

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:39.359 
financial trouble back man yeah crazy

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:44.510 
financial trouble back man yeah crazy
stuff<00:01:40.130> ice<00:01:41.130> age<00:01:41.630> who<00:01:42.630> said<00:01:43.289> humans<00:01:43.889> were<00:01:44.219> going

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
stuff ice age who said humans were going

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.870 
stuff ice age who said humans were going
to<00:01:44.670> make<00:01:44.850> an<00:01:45.210> ice<00:01:45.450> age<00:01:46.429> is<00:01:47.429> like<00:01:47.729> pulling<00:01:48.209> teeth

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
to make an ice age is like pulling teeth

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.529 
to make an ice age is like pulling teeth
but<00:01:50.880> anyway<00:01:52.280> back<00:01:53.280> then<00:01:53.549> there<00:01:53.909> wasn't<00:01:54.060> global

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539 
but anyway back then there wasn't global

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:57.739 
but anyway back then there wasn't global
warming<00:01:54.959> it<00:01:55.079> was<00:01:55.200> global<00:01:55.409> cooling<00:01:56.600> you<00:01:57.600> know

00:01:57.739 --> 00:01:57.749 
warming it was global cooling you know

00:01:57.749 --> 00:02:01.550 
warming it was global cooling you know
if<00:01:58.289> you<00:01:58.499> didn't<00:01:59.189> watch<00:01:59.759> Fox<00:02:00.329> quote<00:02:00.959> news

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
that didn't happen and an ice age was

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.940 
that didn't happen and an ice age was
supposed<00:02:09.569> to<00:02:09.660> come<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:10.380> was<00:02:10.470> all<00:02:10.649> man's

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
supposed to come and it was all man's

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:11.750 
supposed to come and it was all man's
fault

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760

according<00:02:12.659> to<00:02:12.950> home

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.320 

and<00:02:18.540> now<00:02:18.930> it's<00:02:19.170> global<00:02:19.590> warming<00:02:20.330> scientists

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
and now it's global warming scientists

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.940 
and now it's global warming scientists
have<00:02:21.420> been<00:02:21.570> talking<00:02:21.900> about<00:02:21.990> human-caused

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
have been talking about human-caused

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.900 
have been talking about human-caused
global<00:02:23.130> warming<00:02:23.940> for<00:02:24.180> almost<00:02:24.510> 200<00:02:24.870> years<00:02:25.910> and

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
global warming for almost 200 years and

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.080 
global warming for almost 200 years and
it's<00:02:27.060> all<00:02:27.210> man's<00:02:27.540> fault<00:02:28.610> but<00:02:29.610> what<00:02:29.760> people

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
it's all man's fault but what people

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.770 
it's all man's fault but what people
need<00:02:30.270> to<00:02:30.300> understand<00:02:30.990> and<00:02:31.440> pay<00:02:31.560> attention<00:02:31.590> to

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
need to understand and pay attention to

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.370 
need to understand and pay attention to
because<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:34.080> weather<00:02:34.350> runs<00:02:34.740> in<00:02:35.010> cycles

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
because the weather runs in cycles

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.690 
because the weather runs in cycles
weather<00:02:38.180> weather<00:02:39.180> I<00:02:40.140> thought<00:02:41.100> your<00:02:41.250> subject

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
weather weather I thought your subject

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.810 
weather weather I thought your subject
was<00:02:41.940> global<00:02:42.870> climate<00:02:43.830> change

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
was global climate change

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.360 
was global climate change
I<00:02:44.850> thought<00:02:45.420> you're<00:02:45.600> something<00:02:45.959> that<00:02:46.050> was

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
I thought you're something that was

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.160 
I thought you're something that was
global<00:02:47.370> warming<00:02:47.850> now<00:02:48.150> you're<00:02:48.450> switching<00:02:48.750> to

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
global warming now you're switching to

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:56.710 
global warming now you're switching to
weather<00:02:51.980> it<00:02:52.980> repeats<00:02:53.459> itself

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.800 

hurricane<00:02:57.720> sandy<00:02:59.180> terrible<00:03:00.180> storm<00:03:00.390> -

terrible<00:03:01.140> damage<00:03:01.350> to<00:03:01.530> these<00:03:01.770> coasts<00:03:02.330> and<00:03:03.330> I'm

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
terrible damage to these coasts and I'm

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:10.570 
terrible damage to these coasts and I'm
sorry<00:03:04.290> for<00:03:04.470> that

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.520 

yeah<00:03:11.580> and<00:03:11.820> everybody<00:03:12.120> says<00:03:12.480> that<00:03:12.510> you<00:03:13.380> know

yeah and everybody says that you know

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:23.000 
yeah and everybody says that you know
that's<00:03:13.890> that's<00:03:15.050> it<00:03:16.050> wasn't<00:03:16.470> natural<00:03:20.239> the<00:03:22.010> yeah

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
that's that's it wasn't natural the yeah

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.940 
that's that's it wasn't natural the yeah
I<00:03:23.040> guess<00:03:23.370> it's<00:03:23.640> man's<00:03:23.880> fault<00:03:24.500> the<00:03:25.500> government

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
I guess it's man's fault the government

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:32.120
