00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.910
 hello everyone this is a video to do 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:08.459
 the provisional molds of cupcakes 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:12.039
 what are these and these 

00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:17.439
 well before I started I wanted to send you 

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:19.840
 Greetings to alex a monsters 5938 or 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:23.380
 this is how it is pronounced that it is a 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.630
 very very nice girl and very cute and well you 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.810
 I dedicate this video I hope you like it 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:31.720
 good let's start 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.250
 to make these molds that are like that 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.640
 provisional 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.890
 we're going to need polymer clay or 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.170
 what they want to do to make the mold 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.390
 as I have also tried with porcelain 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:47.620
 cold 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:51.460
 also tested with plasticine and porcelain 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:53.339
 and mass to mold but the one that better me 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.280
 has come out in polymer clay 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:59.350
 because if not more textures 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.040
 cupcake and good what we do what 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:05.420
 second thing we're going to need is going to be 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.790
 these plugs and cough 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:11.300
 everything if you appreciate 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:15.100
 which are like I've taken them from 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:19.230
 creams and some toothpastes 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:22.410
 or toothpaste as you say 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:24.220
 and well these textures are useful for me 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:27.000
 cupcake 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:30.850
 and well, the only thing we are going to do is 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.100
 too easy let's take what I 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.470
 I recommend that they use clay 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.780
 polymeric but as I do not have now 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.380
 I will use it as being 'the in 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.909
 cold 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.380
 good 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.380
 let's 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.740
 make him 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.740
 a little ball 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.200
 we are going to slow it down a bit 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:09.210
 and obviously this is something like that 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.530
 which is like a little tip 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:14.130
 but when 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.760
 water in the mold 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:20.040
 it's like a hole or something and 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.260
 that can but in our cupcake 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.980
 then I to avoid this I have 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:29.910
 put a piece of polymer clay 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:33.380
 and then when something is not done 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:38.290
 such that the dimple s 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:40.020
 and well not to make a blessed 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.980
 I want 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:48.750
 we do this 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:48.750
 slowly and we are doing something like that 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.900
 when so 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.300
 and we take it out very carefully and here goes 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.720
 to stay the texture 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.730
 I recommend them in polymer clay 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:09.190
 but as I have right now because 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.860
 I do it here to expose them to show you 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:15.280
 and well it would be something like that obviously 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:18.550
 can take many caps of several of 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:21.190
 these to have several molds for 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.200
 example can be from this that you see a 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.840
 little better 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.240
 then this one is a little bit more 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.730
 delgadito 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:32.950
 this is that more chic and not like 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:36.700
 tiny 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:39.400
 and this can be for an evaluation 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:42.400
 Well this is all I hope you have 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:45.610
 helped them and gave them an idea there of 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.650
 the people who ask me when 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.440
 I'm going to do the video on how to do 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.750
 portion to the cooling because I tell him that neither 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.330
 well the porcelain is finished in cold I do 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.459
 the video since it's very easy is me 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.709
 I think more home than videos 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:02.470
 I 've seen on youtube because they ask 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:05.530
 what paraffin glycerin and then the one that 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:08.370
 I do I think it's very homemade and such 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:11.459
 and I hope 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.799
 I hope to do it very soon I hope that 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:18.290
 have liked the video comment subscribe 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:18.290
 give like and well this is all goodbye
