00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.000
 Hi everyone, I'm fernando said on the blog. 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.470
 dirty laundry is washed in the machine and today I go 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.019
 make a quick video of the washer 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.019
 ecological electrolux and 12-kilogram model 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.389
 ls and 12 showing how it behaves 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.190
 in case of interruption in delivery 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.529
 water is that it is working 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.840
 when you go there do not have 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.570
 water on the faucet where it is connected 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.330
 or if the water pressure was too high 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.029
 Low below were required for 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.470
 correct operation of the washer I go 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.239
 select the work program that I 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:40.770
 I want to now that is normal with a 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:44.879
 rinse here already has some clothes and 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:47.129
 washers select the level below it 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.670
 automatically selects more sauce 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:54.260
 agitation and what is the reservoir and let's 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.260
 keep track of how she's going to behave 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.440
 So that's what happens, she stays. 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.570
 trying to see and water for two 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.460
 minutes and if it detects here in 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.530
 water inlet valve is passing 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.600
 a very low flow is not complete if 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.850
 with the pressure forgiveness below 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.000
 necessary for the correct operation 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:13.140
 or if there is no water it will flash both 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.400
 on / off and the level you 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.050
 selected if it is selected 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.180
 any other level 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.040
 It was him who would be looking for it. 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.230
 both at the beginning of the wash 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.600
 how it was now that I saw the program 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.430
 I called and had this problem of 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.950
 that she is warning that they have no water 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.740
 that is when you got the clothes 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.930
 had water she filled did the steps 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.590
 of sauce and shaking when it arrived at 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.350
 rinse 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.300
 If you do not have a last one, do not 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:42.150
 faucet it will also be flashing 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.890
 the power key and the low level 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.440
 you can do with a problem if 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.790
 you check at the tap that the pressure 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.270
 water is normal 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.690
 You come here behind the washing machine. 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.690
 I went to the bathroom 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:08.269
 and here it has a filter that you 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:09.290
 You can get straight receive better 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.480
 a filter 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:13.010
 when the water that arrives in our house is 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.530
 very dirty is well with many of the 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.190
 Many pebbles waste this filter on 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.799
 pop 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.750
 so you get a clean brush 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.270
 this filter if it is with 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.220
 sand is with pebble you clean 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.570
 this filter has the hose of the 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:31.280
 machine again and after goals that the 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.710
 it remains in operation 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:37.910
 It's just you press the power button 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:39.889
 She will try to refill java. 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.110
 as here there is no water in the 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:44.930
 when actually I who comes to 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.790
 faucet to simulate this problem 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.260
 She 'll try to fill with water again. 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:50.120
 for two minutes 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:56.570
 She will not get it back. 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:59.120
 to conquer a new panel warning you there are 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:01.990
 some problem in the water intake in the 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.990
 Water supply 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.979
 she hung up the ball again 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:49.000
 are normally do not have water 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:50.680
 that the simulation I did was a cut 

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.450
 water but it was the problem 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:55.360
 in that filter that I showed you 

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:57.070
 one thing you live filter lake to 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.470
 normally try on the washer and do not 

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:01.180
 occurs but this problem here in this case 

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:02.919
 What I can do is tighten two 

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:05.710
 times even with the alloy shuts 

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:07.750
 turn off the amateur 

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:09.669
 as it has no water even what I have 

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:11.139
 to make that player and awaits 

00:07:09.669 --> 00:07:12.790
 return of water 

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:16.020
 I hope you liked the video 

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:16.020
 and until the next
