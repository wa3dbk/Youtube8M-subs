00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
average flank this one's I think we can

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.800 
average flank this one's I think we can
all<00:02:08.519> relate<00:02:08.819> to<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.149> it's<00:02:09.269> running<00:02:09.660> through

lockers and running into that claim war

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.920 
lockers and running into that claim war
that<00:02:12.330> you<00:02:12.450> didn't<00:02:12.870> see<00:02:14.719> next<00:02:15.719> one<00:02:15.810> is<00:02:15.870> from

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
that you didn't see next one is from

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.800 
that you didn't see next one is from
kezer<00:02:16.530> on<00:02:17.040> and<00:02:17.459> it's<00:02:18.030> called<00:02:18.239> it<00:02:18.390> know<00:02:18.599> whether

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
kezer on and it's called it know whether

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.750 
kezer on and it's called it know whether
to<00:02:18.959> laugh<00:02:18.989> or<00:02:19.319> hysterically<00:02:19.739> rage<00:02:19.980> quit

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
to laugh or hysterically rage quit

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.240 
to laugh or hysterically rage quit
so<00:02:20.909> I<00:02:20.939> did<00:02:21.150> both<00:02:21.360> this<00:02:21.989> one<00:02:22.200> shows<00:02:22.409> off<00:02:22.739> the

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
so I did both this one shows off the

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.920 
so I did both this one shows off the
wonderful<00:02:24.000> netcode<00:02:24.360> that<00:02:24.540> we<00:02:24.629> have<00:02:24.780> in

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
wonderful netcode that we have in

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.559 
wonderful netcode that we have in
battlefield<00:02:25.349> 4<00:02:25.409> and<00:02:25.819> I<00:02:26.819> think<00:02:27.420> he<00:02:27.540> probably

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
battlefield 4 and I think he probably

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.940 
battlefield 4 and I think he probably
checked<00:02:28.319> his<00:02:28.439> keyboard<00:02:28.890> at<00:02:29.099> the<00:02:29.250> end<00:02:30.769> last<00:02:31.769> but

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
checked his keyboard at the end last but

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.770 
checked his keyboard at the end last but
not<00:02:31.980> least<00:02:32.099> Olin<00:02:32.730> is<00:02:32.819> called<00:02:33.090> that<00:02:33.420> is<00:02:33.569> one<00:02:33.750> way

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590
