top<00:02:23.410> leagues<00:02:23.830> in<00:02:24.130> the<00:02:24.160> world<00:02:24.250> not<00:02:24.790> many

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
top leagues in the world not many

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.059 
top leagues in the world not many

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
midfielders managed up yeah yeah I think

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.570 
midfielders managed up yeah yeah I think
I<00:02:27.850> think<00:02:28.030> it's<00:02:28.900> because<00:02:29.260> he<00:02:29.500> is<00:02:29.890> the<00:02:30.069> photo<00:02:30.280> for

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
I think it's because he is the photo for

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.610 
I think it's because he is the photo for
Pellegrini<00:02:31.060> no<00:02:31.239> because<00:02:32.050> he<00:02:32.140> give<00:02:32.319> me<00:02:32.350> more

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
Pellegrini no because he give me more

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:33.930 
Pellegrini no because he give me more
freedom<00:02:32.800> in<00:02:33.069> the<00:02:33.160> front<00:02:33.370> you<00:02:33.489> know<00:02:33.580> and<00:02:33.819> then

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
freedom in the front you know and then

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.850 
freedom in the front you know and then

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
to attack more because he knew it's

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.390 
to attack more because he knew it's
always<00:02:38.080> difficult<00:02:38.290> but<00:02:38.680> we<00:02:38.890> have<00:02:39.040> to<00:02:39.220> choose
