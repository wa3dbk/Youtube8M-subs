00:00:01.089 --> 00:00:03.390
 the other world 

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.360
 but see this is the physical part 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.959
 because it is the most beautiful that while my body was there charred 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:15.989
 I was in that moment a very beautiful white antÃ³nio of 

00:00:15.989 --> 00:00:16.829
 light 

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:21.489
 a beautiful one that made me feel a joy with a peace a happiness 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:26.980
 that I have no human words we stop describes the greatness of that moment 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.909
 it was a huge stress 

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:32.700
 I was advancing semis of causes 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.610
 nothing weighed inside that tunnel 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.510
 King 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.510
 and in the bottom of that tunnel I saw a white light as I am 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.240
 once of medicine 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.220
 I say white to say any more color 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.850
 but these are not things that look like any color of the earth 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.810
 this light was beautiful 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.150
 this index is through it an action of this country I love you of light 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.120
 When I climbed that tunnel into the light, I say to myself 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.730
 I loved it, I died 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:07.780
 at this moment present at the beginning of this year 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.290
 father god, my little children 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.500
 What are you going to tell my kids? 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.659
 this busy mother who never had time for them 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.100
 would weigh being every day in the morning 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.280
 It was coming back that night. 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.650
 Yes, the reality of my life 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.780
 and I felt a lot of sadness 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.540
 I left home determined to win a 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.860
 But they stayed behind my house. 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.480
 and my children 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.850
 this instant 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.909
 the absence of my children no longer feeling my body nor the dimension 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.000
 of time and space 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.880
 I looked and saw something very beautiful 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.010
 of all the people in my life 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.350
 at once 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.310
 at the same time 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.940
 all people 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.060
 the dividends and the dead 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.420
 hugged - my great grandparents 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.600
 to my grandparents but my parents who had already died 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.190
 to all 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.390
 timing 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.230
 wonderful 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.920
 I realized then that I had been deceived by the history of reincarnation 

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:12.529
 sincerely my room 

00:02:12.529 --> 00:02:14.369
 James incarnated in someone 

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:16.000
 are they certainly not 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.779
 and because it would be expensive 

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:19.309
 I left it like this 

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:22.309
 I did not go deep into where my grandmother was reincarnated. 

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:24.120
 what do you know 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.019
 I defended reincarnation 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.230
 and now he had just embraced my grandparents voice 

00:02:29.779 --> 00:02:31.339
 embracing the incident 

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:33.669
 like all people 

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:35.169
 had the knowledge 

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:38.389
 alive and dead and all at once 

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:40.779
 just my daughter 

00:02:40.779 --> 00:02:43.049
 When I hugged, I got scared. 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:46.509
 I was nine years old and I felt my embrace. 

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:51.829
 In this I can also embrace gibbs, but normally we do not feel this 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:53.879
 hug 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:57.650
 I almost did not notice the passing of time in that great moment 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:02:59.270
 following 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.950
 now I already know my body I did not look at ordinary people 

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:06.759
 because before I only knew how to criticize 

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:08.759

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:12.149

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:14.090

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.389
 was competent 

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:16.739

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.509

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:25.670

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.769
 while this pressure 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:33.779
 and continue to advance such happy pen and the more climb up but felt that 

00:03:33.779 --> 00:03:35.939

 and in the background birds have a wide editing 

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:41.779

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:51.880
 with wire 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.329
 It is very nice 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:54.619
 so different 

00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:57.440
 everything was so beautiful that it had already diminished 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.560
 very true 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.639
 in that wonderful place 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:03.619
 no words to describe 

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:05.419
 when I was younger 

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:09.349
 there were 2 to 2 and the sale was something that appeared to be an entrance 

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:13.029
 is very different from everything we know each 

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:14.799

 at that moment we are opening among those with the mirim mogi 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.469

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:27.710
 I felt I should not 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.240
 I could not even get in there.
