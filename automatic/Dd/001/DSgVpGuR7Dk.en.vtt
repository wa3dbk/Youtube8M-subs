or you could do them in a studio in your
gym<00:00:17.240> anywhere<00:00:18.240> that<00:00:18.390> has<00:00:18.510> basically<00:00:18.779> enough

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
gym anywhere that has basically enough

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.099 
gym anywhere that has basically enough
space<00:00:19.859> just<00:00:20.609> for<00:00:20.760> yourself<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.359> be<00:00:21.510> moving

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
space just for yourself to be moving

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.269 
space just for yourself to be moving
around<00:00:22.350> so<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.130> drill<00:00:23.369> number<00:00:23.609> one<00:00:23.850> is<00:00:24.859> on<00:00:25.859> the

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
around so the drill number one is on the

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.910 
around so the drill number one is on the
line<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:27.019> the<00:00:28.019> reason<00:00:28.349> I'm<00:00:28.470> holding<00:00:28.590> my

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
line and the reason I'm holding my

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.679 
line and the reason I'm holding my
racket<00:00:29.279> is<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.519> make<00:00:29.670> it<00:00:29.820> more<00:00:29.939> specific<00:00:30.240> for

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
racket is to make it more specific for

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.179 
racket is to make it more specific for
tennis<00:00:31.019> so<00:00:31.320> you<00:00:31.380> can<00:00:31.619> do<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:31.769> without<00:00:32.009> holding

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
tennis so you can do it without holding

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.520 
tennis so you can do it without holding
your<00:00:32.430> racket<00:00:32.759> you<00:00:32.850> can<00:00:33.000> put<00:00:33.149> your<00:00:33.300> racket<00:00:33.530> down

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
your racket you can put your racket down

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.229 
your racket you can put your racket down
behind<00:00:34.950> you<00:00:35.100> or<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.460> can<00:00:35.610> hold<00:00:35.790> it<00:00:35.969> in<00:00:36.120> your

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
behind you or you can hold it in your

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.240 
behind you or you can hold it in your
ready<00:00:36.480> position<00:00:36.590> and<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.710> reason<00:00:38.010> I<00:00:38.100> like

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
ready position and the reason I like

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.069 
ready position and the reason I like
doing<00:00:38.520> it<00:00:38.640> with<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.850> racket<00:00:39.210> is<00:00:39.719> just

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
doing it with the racket is just

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.780 
doing it with the racket is just
replicating<00:00:40.739> that<00:00:40.770> running<00:00:41.160> position<00:00:41.340> when

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
replicating that running position when

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:42.979 
replicating that running position when
you're<00:00:41.969> actually<00:00:42.090> going<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.390> do<00:00:42.540> your<00:00:42.690> split

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
you're actually going to do your split

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.770 
you're actually going to do your split
step<00:00:43.230> so<00:00:44.160> drill<00:00:44.399> number<00:00:44.550> one<00:00:44.850> I'm<00:00:45.600> going<00:00:45.719> to

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
step so drill number one I'm going to

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.170 
step so drill number one I'm going to
have<00:00:45.840> my<00:00:46.050> feet<00:00:46.350> together<00:00:46.530> like<00:00:46.920> this<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.399> I'm

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
going to go into a split step over the

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.189

together so that's the drill number one

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:22.310 
together so that's the drill number one
drill<00:01:20.549> number<00:01:20.850> two<00:01:21.030> it's<00:01:21.479> very<00:01:21.689> similar<00:01:21.960> but

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
drill number two it's very similar but

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.160 
drill number two it's very similar but
now<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:22.979> start<00:01:23.430> with<00:01:23.549> my<00:01:23.700> feet<00:01:23.970> in<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:24.720> ready

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
position in that split step position I

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.450 
position in that split step position I
go<00:01:27.570> over<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:27.930> line<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.590> I<00:01:28.710> come<00:01:28.920> back<00:01:29.130> and

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
go over the line and I come back and

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.420 
go over the line and I come back and
that's<00:01:29.820> one<00:01:30.119> so<00:01:30.720> again<00:01:30.840> we<00:01:31.560> can<00:01:31.740> go<00:01:31.860> for<00:01:32.070> ten<00:01:32.280> to

that's one so again we can go for ten to

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.630 
that's one so again we can go for ten to
20<00:01:32.790> depending<00:01:33.299> on<00:01:33.689> your<00:01:33.810> level<00:01:34.790> one

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640

three four five six seven eight nine ten

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.320 
three four five six seven eight nine ten
and<00:01:43.500> drill<00:01:44.500> number<00:01:44.770> three<00:01:44.979> guys<00:01:45.190> is<00:01:45.520> on<00:01:46.180> the

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
can

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.550 
can
by<00:01:50.470> Dex<00:01:51.330> that's<00:01:52.330> that<00:01:52.750> would<00:01:52.869> be<00:01:52.930> the<00:01:53.229> kind<00:01:53.500> of

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
by Dex that's that would be the kind of

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.900 
by Dex that's that would be the kind of
splits<00:01:53.860> that<00:01:53.920> you<00:01:54.130> were<00:01:54.220> doing<00:01:54.460> the<00:01:54.520> kind<00:01:54.820> of

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:54.910 
splits that you were doing the kind of

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.400 
splits that you were doing the kind of
