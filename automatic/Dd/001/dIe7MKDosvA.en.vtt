00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.500
 For war-devastated nations, every choice of ruler is a triumph. 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.500
 Triumph for whom? 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.500
 He was elected our new ruler. 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:08.400
 I waited a long time for this day. 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.800
 I will be God! 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.300
 Some seek power to satisfy their own desires. 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.200
 Ambition turns into treachery. 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.000
 And betrayal is a means of murder. 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.300
 We need your help, Kubel. 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.200
 Sorrow becomes a solution. 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.000
 And the solution means action! 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.500
 In the name of Valkyon, I will judge your sins. 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.600
 Dazed freedom opposes tyranny. 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.500
 While the fate of the world hangs in the balance. 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.500
 "Where did you find the courage to go crazy?" 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.000
 It's time to act! 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
