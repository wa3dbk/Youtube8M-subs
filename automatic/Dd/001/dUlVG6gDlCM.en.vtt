00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:10.440
 guitar ibanez rg 350 made in indonesia 

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:14.480
 2006 traditionally for banners 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:17.699
 Breck basswood neck of the three pieces of maple 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:20.640
 rosewood lining three gauge 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.880
 2 humbuckers one single 5-position 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.210
 switch volume tones lever floyd 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.380
 rose 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:32.900
 everything is pretty trite and I usually either 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.900
 It sounds pretty good backwards. 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.550
 Yes 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.340
 and 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:01.329
 sensors are replaced by dima 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:05.259
 revolution middle symbol standard 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.560
 there is 1 layer of firewood here and words ban 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:08.950
 about 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:12.250
 edge there is such a small lack of affairs 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.440
 the fact that the lever you Floyd usually 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.770
 screwed in if it is simply inserted 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.790
 and therefore 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.690
 since it is not fixed here 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:26.530
 reliably he backlash it a little 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.240
 principle is not particularly important but if often 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.220
 use floyd it can 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:34.030
 a little annoying and so basically 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:37.530
 well enough done and in order to 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.530
 fly bird is wonderful 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.869
 losing nothing at all 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:25.960
 it is worth noting that with time to guitar 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.960
 good enough sufficiently serious 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:48.360
 Well, agree well for the guitars that 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.360
 principle costs less than a thousand dollars 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.910
 it still sounds not disabled only 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:03:01.150
 no compresses distortion anything 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:04.090
 no longer long enough all this 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:08.700
 happens so switch position 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.700
 when this reel and singles works 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:28.319
 such strata sounds third 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.989
 position when this single works 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.099
 single character own npa no this 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.950
 clear to all 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:37.430
 but nevertheless you could play it 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.430
 he is ready 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.260
 although it's better to do it in this 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.560
 the position of how this gun works here and 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.560
 single 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.500
 firstly there is no background secondly it turns out 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:02.500
 more reliably even more like 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.500
 original 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.189
 Well , something so wonderful goes good 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.609
 scientifically everything else 

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:21.209
 Well, the fifth position when it works only 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.209
 hambaker 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:47.400
 sings quite well and you can even 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.400
 play something like this 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:05:01.970
 Well, something like that on a clean sound 

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.970
 also very good 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:10.140
 bridge on your own in africa bridge 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.140
 All clear we shoot a bright sound 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:18.440
 I like the second position the most 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:20.900
 for clear sound when working here 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:29.539
 single coil 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:32.060
 there is something like that in it from tele to me 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:34.900
 it seems for funk and whether country simply 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:34.900
 beautiful position 

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:55.109
 something like this 

00:05:52.109 --> 00:05:55.109
 single 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:18.479
 enough usually for the character in this 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:23.699
 fourth position when this reel 

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:26.370
 working you single can be achieved in 

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:29.720
 principle almost identical 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.720
 stratocaster sounds 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:46.910
 I'm really the second position is brighter 

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:50.680
 more interesting well and the last position where 

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:50.680
 only nickname hambaker works 

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:47.630
 but
