brake your magnet will have a face on it
something<00:00:39.120> similar<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.750> this<00:00:39.899> where<00:00:40.469> it

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
something similar to this where it

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.170 
something similar to this where it
actually<00:00:40.710> has<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.190> cross<00:00:41.489> section<00:00:41.969> in<00:00:42.090> the

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
actually has a cross section in the

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.590 
actually has a cross section in the
middle<00:00:42.300> here<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:42.840> section<00:00:43.620> sits<00:00:43.950> on<00:00:44.129> the

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
middle here that section sits on the

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.270 
middle here that section sits on the
magnet<00:00:45.600> lever<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:46.320> magnet<00:00:46.680> lever<00:00:46.890> is<00:00:47.070> this

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
magnet lever the magnet lever is this

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.450 
magnet lever the magnet lever is this
item<00:00:47.489> here<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.180> this<00:00:49.140> is<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.680> where<00:00:50.340> the

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
item here and this is is where the

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.490 
item here and this is is where the
magnet<00:00:50.789> would<00:00:50.910> normally<00:00:51.270> sit<00:00:51.510> that's<00:00:51.899> where

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
magnet would normally sit that's where

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.860 
magnet would normally sit that's where
the<00:00:52.710> magnet<00:00:53.489> lever<00:00:53.670> goes<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.300> what<00:00:54.480> happens

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
the magnet lever goes and what happens

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.580 
the magnet lever goes and what happens
is<00:00:55.230> when<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.309> power<00:00:56.550> is<00:00:56.730> put<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.539> this<00:00:57.690> magnify

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
is when the power is put to this magnify

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.619 
is when the power is put to this magnify
see<00:00:58.649> it<00:00:58.980> attaches<00:00:59.460> itself<00:00:59.789> to<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.090> brake<00:01:00.329> drum

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
see it attaches itself to the brake drum

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.110 
see it attaches itself to the brake drum
as<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:01.469> brake<00:01:01.680> drum<00:01:01.949> is<00:01:02.129> rotating<00:01:02.730> it<00:01:02.850> wants

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
as the brake drum is rotating it wants

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.369 
as the brake drum is rotating it wants
to<00:01:03.239> pull<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.449> magnet<00:01:03.780> with<00:01:04.110> it

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
to pull the magnet with it

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.429 
to pull the magnet with it
so<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.949> does<00:01:05.129> this<00:01:05.430> sort<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.729> thing<00:01:05.970> as<00:01:06.439> lever

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
so it does this sort of thing as lever

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.289 
so it does this sort of thing as lever
moves<00:01:07.770> forward<00:01:08.189> it<00:01:08.280> spreads<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.760> brake<00:01:08.970> shoes

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
moves forward it spreads the brake shoes

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.670 
moves forward it spreads the brake shoes
and<00:01:09.330> that's<00:01:09.600> what<00:01:09.810> gives<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.140> your<00:01:10.170> braking

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
and that's what gives you your braking

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.820 
and that's what gives you your braking
capabilities<00:01:11.400> with<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.110> off-road<00:01:13.110> camper

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
capabilities with a off-road camper

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.179 
capabilities with a off-road camper
trailer<00:01:14.130> or<00:01:14.400> Caravan<00:01:15.090> it's<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.960> very<00:01:16.619> good<00:01:16.860> idea

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
trailer or Caravan it's a very good idea

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.090 
trailer or Caravan it's a very good idea
to<00:01:17.250> be<00:01:17.520> asking<00:01:17.939> for<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.540> alcove<00:01:19.140> off-road

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
to be asking for the alcove off-road

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.399 
to be asking for the alcove off-road
electric<00:01:21.060> brake<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:22.049> difference

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
electric brake and the difference

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.350 
electric brake and the difference
between<00:01:22.560> this<00:01:23.009> off-road<00:01:23.369> brake<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.150> a

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
between this off-road brake and a

between this off-road brake and a
standard<00:01:24.780> brake<00:01:25.020> is<00:01:25.610> this<00:01:26.610> Center<00:01:27.450> of<00:01:27.689> the

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
standard brake is this Center of the
