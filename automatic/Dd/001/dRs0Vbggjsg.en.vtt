00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.380
 and 2 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.429
 in this video we are going to see a very book 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.860
 very good and funny with which we are going to 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:35.629
 to be able to freak out and leave the whole 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.820
 people the first thing we have to do 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:39.649
 will be to put the bike for passengers and 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.170
 ride us and have a ride 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:43.910
 Friend the friend can not have 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.199
 created the room is to say that we need 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.150
 be three 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:48.769
 the two of us that we have not created it and a 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.510
 third friend who creates us so that 

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:52.670
 we do it 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.100
 that is to say that probably in games 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.600
 go forward perfectly once 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.680
 we have left the friend there as if 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.019
 we were going to do a trick of money 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.180
 we got a car and got out of the car 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:04.400
 you will see that it disappears and we ride 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.200
 the bike when riding on the bike what 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.210
 let's do is buy a karim revel 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.880
 and place in any position 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.159
 garage once we bought it as 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.780
 you know the mechanic can bring it to us 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.369
 although it has not yet reached our 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.560
 garage simply moving us away a 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:20.360
 little bit of our garage that's what 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.770
 I'm doing right now I 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.570
 I move a little bit away from the garage so that 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.180
 mechanic want to bring me karim reveal 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.710
 once I have moved away what I do is 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.030
 I take out my mobile 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.829
 I ask the mechanic to bring me 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.120
 calle revel and I get to the saints 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:34.250
 custom 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.070
 going as if I was going to do a trick of 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:40.580
 money and once I get into the saints 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:43.070
 custom I ask the karim revel and I sell the 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.910
 motorbike if you notice and the friend is in the 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.380
 motorcycle 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.050
 the trick will have gone to the 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.940
 perfection and as you see it will be scratched 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.500
 very much and the only thing that we have to 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.440
 to do is have a little patience 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.480
 until it stops being scratched once 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.800
 stop hitting chestnut that today is 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.190
 hitting lurches here and there to 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.170
 here for there 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.270
 our partner will seem to have 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.010
 disappeared but it will really continue in 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.540
 the bike and the only thing that we will have to 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.880
 do so that the ship is already perfect 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.560
 will make any poet or any 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.150
 horse or anything in which 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.950
 we initially went to 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.990
 to fall off the bike but what we will do 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.630
 throw to our partner who will be 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.940
 behind once we do that we can already 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.740
 be totally invincible on the motorcycle 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.020
 because we will not fall, let's do what 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.640
 let's do and apart from that we'll be the 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.530
 vehicle destroyers because 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.300
 simply riding us and lowering the 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.370
 of any vehicle what we are going to 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.410
 to do is to automatically disappear 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.790
 and they are not going to charge us that is to say 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.770
 we can say it in some way 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.990
 burst all cars to our 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.690
 friends without being charged 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.490
 a penny and if on top of it without being 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.780
 wait for nothing because nobody really 

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.280
 it is expected that when someone is assembled and 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.930
 get out of a car the car go to 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.340
 disappear and will call car like that 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.340
 is destroyed and above you have not 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.260
 charged not a cent as with the 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.370
 moto the pirouettes circling that low 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.290
 in the back as if you were with a 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.820
 wheel it seems that you take a motorcycle like me 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.170

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.780
