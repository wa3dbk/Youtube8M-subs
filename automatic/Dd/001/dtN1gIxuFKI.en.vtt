00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:46.509 
your phone but you guys can see that it
really<00:03:45.139> doesn't<00:03:45.500> add<00:03:45.650> any<00:03:45.889> extra<00:03:45.979> thickness

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
really doesn't add any extra thickness

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:48.580 
really doesn't add any extra thickness
as<00:03:46.819> almost<00:03:47.449> as<00:03:47.599> if<00:03:47.720> you're<00:03:47.870> not<00:03:47.959> using<00:03:48.169> a<00:03:48.379> case

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
as almost as if you're not using a case

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.819 
as almost as if you're not using a case
at<00:03:48.799> all<00:03:49.509> this<00:03:50.509> case<00:03:50.750> in<00:03:50.989> particular<00:03:51.199> kind<00:03:51.799> of

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:51.829 
at all this case in particular kind of

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:54.460 
at all this case in particular kind of
gives<00:03:51.979> it<00:03:52.099> a<00:03:52.189> metallic<00:03:52.879> look<00:03:53.169> so<00:03:54.169> I<00:03:54.229> really

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
gives it a metallic look so I really

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.649 
gives it a metallic look so I really
like<00:03:54.620> the<00:03:54.769> style<00:03:54.829> of<00:03:55.220> this<00:03:55.400> case<00:03:55.669> like<00:03:56.509> I<00:03:56.599> said

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
I love the fact that it doesn't add any

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.360 
I love the fact that it doesn't add any
bulk<00:03:58.370> to<00:03:58.759> your<00:03:58.790> phone<00:03:59.090> and<00:03:59.739> it<00:04:00.739> has<00:04:01.099> these
