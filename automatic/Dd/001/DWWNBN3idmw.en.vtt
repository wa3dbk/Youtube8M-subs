00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
you how to start that braid here today

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.350 
you how to start that braid here today
so<00:00:10.890> you<00:00:10.920> start<00:00:11.280> out<00:00:11.370> with<00:00:11.490> two<00:00:11.730> pieces<00:00:12.090> of

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
so you start out with two pieces of

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.669 
so you start out with two pieces of
boondoggle<00:00:13.310> of<00:00:14.310> equal<00:00:15.030> length<00:00:15.350> take<00:00:16.350> one<00:00:16.560> of

00:00:16.669 --> 00:00:16.679 
boondoggle of equal length take one of

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:19.099 
boondoggle of equal length take one of
those<00:00:16.769> pieces<00:00:17.039> hang<00:00:17.970> it<00:00:18.089> over<00:00:18.240> your<00:00:18.599> index

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
those pieces hang it over your index

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.169 
those pieces hang it over your index
finger<00:00:19.859> have<00:00:20.160> about<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.579> same<00:00:20.849> amount

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:21.179 
finger have about the same amount

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:25.210 
finger have about the same amount
hanging<00:00:21.900> down<00:00:22.109> on<00:00:22.410> both<00:00:23.009> sides<00:00:23.339> and<00:00:23.730> then<00:00:24.329> you

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
hanging down on both sides and then you

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:27.919 
hanging down on both sides and then you
bring<00:00:26.220> that<00:00:26.460> piece<00:00:26.789> down<00:00:27.089> and<00:00:27.150> over<00:00:27.570> your

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:27.929 
bring that piece down and over your

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:31.420 
bring that piece down and over your
finger<00:00:28.320> so<00:00:28.470> you<00:00:28.529> have<00:00:28.650> two<00:00:28.949> loops<00:00:29.189> around<00:00:29.609> and

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
finger so you have two loops around and

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.549 
finger so you have two loops around and
then<00:00:32.430> just<00:00:32.910> hold<00:00:33.149> those<00:00:33.449> the<00:00:33.960> two<00:00:34.170> strands

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
then just hold those the two strands

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.410 
then just hold those the two strands
with<00:00:34.770> your<00:00:34.920> thumb<00:00:35.160> in<00:00:35.309> your<00:00:35.340> your<00:00:36.210> middle

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
with your thumb in your your middle

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.830 
with your thumb in your your middle
finger<00:00:37.850> keeping<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:39.000> from<00:00:39.180> twisting<00:00:39.719> around

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
finger keeping it from twisting around

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.569 
finger keeping it from twisting around
you<00:00:40.230> don't<00:00:40.379> want<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.800> overlap<00:00:41.250> at<00:00:41.460> all

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
you don't want it to overlap at all

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.209 
you don't want it to overlap at all
these<00:00:42.090> have<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.390> two<00:00:42.600> loops<00:00:42.840> there<00:00:43.199> and<00:00:43.440> then

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
these have the two loops there and then

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.779 
these have the two loops there and then
you<00:00:44.760> take<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.539> second<00:00:45.960> piece<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.670> from<00:00:47.670> my

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
you take the second piece and from my

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.970 
you take the second piece and from my
left<00:00:48.059> or<00:00:48.269> right<00:00:48.480> I'm<00:00:48.690> putting<00:00:49.019> it<00:00:49.230> under<00:00:49.649> both

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
left or right I'm putting it under both

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.860 
left or right I'm putting it under both
of<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.550> loops<00:00:50.760> so<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.269> goes<00:00:51.390> under<00:00:51.629> both<00:00:51.839> the

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
of the loops so it goes under both the

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.349 
of the loops so it goes under both the
loops<00:00:52.199> pull<00:00:52.589> it<00:00:52.800> until<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.789> get<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:54.059> about<00:00:54.239> the

00:00:54.349 --> 00:00:54.359 
loops pull it until you get to about the

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:58.009 
loops pull it until you get to about the
center<00:00:54.690> point<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.649> piece<00:00:56.780> you<00:00:57.780> want<00:00:57.960> to

00:00:58.009 --> 00:00:58.019 
center point of that piece you want to

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:00.369 
center point of that piece you want to
have<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.289> same<00:00:58.499> amount<00:00:58.829> on<00:00:59.039> both<00:00:59.640> sides

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
have the same amount on both sides

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.549 
have the same amount on both sides
hanging<00:01:01.379> out<00:01:01.530> so<00:01:02.239> your<00:01:03.239> braid<00:01:03.510> will<00:01:03.660> be<00:01:03.839> have

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
hanging out so your braid will be have

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.460 
hanging out so your braid will be have
the<00:01:04.680> same<00:01:04.890> same<00:01:05.309> amount<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.640> both<00:01:05.880> colors<00:01:06.470> so

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
the same same amount of both colors so

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.179 
the same same amount of both colors so
all<00:01:08.159> right<00:01:08.430> so<00:01:09.180> once<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.200> got<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.500> underneath

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
all right so once you got it underneath

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.100 
all right so once you got it underneath
then<00:01:11.759> you<00:01:11.909> take<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.780> left<00:01:13.500> side<00:01:14.540> strand<00:01:15.540> this

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
then you take the left side strand this

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.100 
then you take the left side strand this
is<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.680> left<00:01:16.920> this<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.399> right<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.119> and

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
is the left this is the right and and

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.190 
is the left this is the right and and
this<00:01:19.520> strand<00:01:20.520> is<00:01:21.180> going<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.450> be<00:01:21.570> in<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.780> center

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
this strand is going to be in the center

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.990 
this strand is going to be in the center
of<00:01:22.229> where<00:01:22.590> we're<00:01:22.770> going<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.950> loop<00:01:23.159> these<00:01:23.399> so

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
of where we're going to loop these so

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.280 
of where we're going to loop these so
we're<00:01:24.149> going<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.299> take<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.630> left<00:01:24.869> side<00:01:25.079> we're

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
we're going to take the left side we're

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.200 
we're going to take the left side we're
going<00:01:25.409> to<00:01:25.470> go<00:01:25.590> over<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:26.280> first<00:01:26.579> yellow<00:01:26.909> loop

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
going to go over the first yellow loop

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.120 
going to go over the first yellow loop
and<00:01:27.450> under<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:27.869> second<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.920> we're<00:01:29.040> doing

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
and under the second and we're doing

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.120 
and under the second and we're doing
that<00:01:29.430> above<00:01:30.170> this<00:01:31.170> Center<00:01:31.590> point<00:01:31.860> where<00:01:32.040> we

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
that above this Center point where we

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.550 
that above this Center point where we
started<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:33.450> then<00:01:33.659> we<00:01:33.780> take<00:01:33.930> this<00:01:34.170> right

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
started and then we take this right

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.179 
started and then we take this right
strand<00:01:35.100> which<00:01:35.579> is<00:01:36.049> from<00:01:37.049> this<00:01:37.259> original<00:01:37.530> piece

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
strand which is from this original piece

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.580 
strand which is from this original piece
and<00:01:38.490> it's<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.600> right<00:01:39.780> side<00:01:40.020> of<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:40.290> and

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
and it's the right side of that and

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.760 
and it's the right side of that and
we're<00:01:40.740> going<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:40.890> go<00:01:41.100> over<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:42.000> under<00:01:42.770> the

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
we're going to go over and under the

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.149 
we're going to go over and under the
yellow<00:01:44.039> and<00:01:44.810> then<00:01:47.600> just<00:01:48.600> kind<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:48.950> pull<00:01:49.950> like

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
yellow and then just kind of pull like

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.779 
yellow and then just kind of pull like
that<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:50.520> see<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.759> square<00:01:51.090> starting<00:01:51.479> to<00:01:51.539> form

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789 
that you see a square starting to form

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:57.249 
that you see a square starting to form
gently<00:01:54.020> get<00:01:55.020> your<00:01:55.140> finger<00:01:55.560> out<00:01:55.590> from<00:01:56.520> there

gently get your finger out from there
without<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:59.189> without<00:01:59.670> twisting<00:02:00.240> these

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:00.359 
without and without twisting these

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:03.410 
without and without twisting these
pieces<00:02:00.810> around<00:02:01.039> keeping<00:02:02.039> them<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.579> how<00:02:03.270> they

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
pieces around keeping them and how they

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.760 
pieces around keeping them and how they
were<00:02:03.479> we<00:02:04.409> slowly<00:02:05.719> pull<00:02:06.719> them
