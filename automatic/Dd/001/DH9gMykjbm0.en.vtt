 television or reading and tell them 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.319
 the comments are passed there he used 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.870
 say of the first reports of the 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.820
 Nasa did not fail to survive barely 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.190
 a few moments the so-called comet of 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.410
 century approached as much as it had 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.230
 approached any of our king giving a 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.750
 show without equal however his 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.510
 disintegration could allow to find 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.490
 data and never imagine tells them the mass 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.119
 here he left for the moment and so 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:33.920
 minus the amazing images of this one 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:38.329
 to what happened so close to the sun and yes 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.329
 as the thistle burned its wings 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.020
 it is the first incursion of the 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.420
 comet there are in our solar system 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.640
 and to be able to study it you would get 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.860
 information never seen before of the 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.130
 composition of the universe four thousand ago 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.200
 600 million years was discovered 21 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.510
 September 2012 by observers 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.810
 amateurs in Russia and since then 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.400
 Space experts follow his step 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.440
 name is due to the optical network with the 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.510
 what was discovered is to say the 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.910
 international scientific optical network 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:12.040
 it was just in this month when he 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.710
 they obtained videos that impressed the 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.470
 whole world in this is appreciated as there 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:20.369
 they are close to mercury and they also 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.369
 appreciate the earth 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:27.170
 there are are traveling millions of years 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:30.049
 and it has a speed of 337 kilometers 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.600
 per second with this inertia in its path 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:34.789
 for our planet was captured from 20 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.270
 to November 25 as seen in 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:37.270
 screen 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:45.700
 after the so-called comet of the century 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.409
 continued his way to the sun the nasa 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.319
 he managed to capture allison during the 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:52.689
 last 72 hours making millions 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:56.609
 of people in the world will appreciate your 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:56.609
 long and surprising journey 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.409
 this comet is very curious because it is the 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.939
 first and the only time you can see 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.210
 because it has an orbit 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:09.369
 hyperbolic in this way there are will have 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.590
 from now on more than ever the 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.300
 permanent attention not only of the 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.150
 scientists dedicated to the subject 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:20.280
 spatial but also of all those who 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.280
 enjoy the wonders of the universe 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.190
 informed oscar gallegos of our channel 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:27.019
 from youtube so you 're always 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:30.140
