00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.450

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.520

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.470
 I have a little white fondant and 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.660
 I also have a little bit of red fondant 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.730

 You can have the bow both red and 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.820
 I have a cupcake that I have today 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.340
 baked in a white coffee so that 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.530
 play with my white kitten I have a 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.929
 some water from a brush a stick 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.329
 cocktail or toothpick I have some mini 

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:49.010
 m &amp; m I have chosen only the brown ones 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.050
 and yellow I have vegetable coloring 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.879
 liquid black color that I bought in the 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.949
 supermarket or can use chocolate 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.559
 dark melted circular cutter 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.219
 this this 3 and a quarter inches or 8 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.559
 centimeters 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:02.120
 I have chosen one that is one size larger 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.519
 big that the top of me 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.290
 cupcake I have a fondant roll but 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.360
 if they do not have one they can use a roller 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.439
 common a knife a little bit of our 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.490
 silver butter cream 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:12.290
 perfect for 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.149
 in sleeves and we have a fantastic 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.979
 tutorial and recipe on our channel in 

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:17.840
 if they want to see it and I have a 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.820
 sprayer with the scene can also 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.580
 using powdered sugar or icing sugar is 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.380
 to prevent the fondant from sticking it 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.689
 first thing that I will do is raise the cap of 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.580
 dome-shaped microtech so with 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:30.409
 my knife took a little glaze and 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.170
 I distributed it well over my cupcake 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:35.600
 forming a mountaineer softened everything 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.510
 until the edges try not to exceed 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.790
 the edges 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.890
 and with him against the edge of my knife and 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.770
 that is smooth and flat alder well the 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.050
 frosting giving it a dome shape if 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.060
 they will be a few of these were 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.530
 I recommend that you do not do too many 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.600
 advance because the cream of 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.510
 butter tends to dry a little and 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.180
 they want to glacier put glacier fondant and 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:00.400
 put fondant again otherwise 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:03.700
 the glaze may dry too much and the 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:06.620
 fondant will not stick well so I'm going to 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.960
 take a little of the white fondant 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.060
 I like to keep the fondant inside 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.040
 of a ziploc-type hermetic bag for 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.110
 prevent it from drying 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.120
 he kneaded it a little in my hands by 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.880
 a few seconds to soften it and do it 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.160
 easy to stretch 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.330
 they make a little ball and crush it a little 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.330
 to make a circular shape 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.810
 I sprinkle a little cornstarch on the 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.490
 work table and I put on the 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.300
 fondant moving a little so that the 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.760
 cornstarch sticking below 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.890
 now I stretch it in a circular way to 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.910
 able to cut a nice circle for the 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.910
 face let him kitty 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.750
 it does not really matter how thick or 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:01.730
 thin leave your fondant depends on 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:01.730
 how much they like the taste of fondant 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.150
 and now I cut a nice and perfect 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.640
 circle with cutter 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:19.049
 and I put this circle directly on 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.049
 my cupcake already glazed 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.920
 and with my fingers he stretched the fondant 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.630
 smoothing it up the edges can 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.730
 see that I'm holding him in his 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.360
 position with my middle finger and with my finger 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.740
 index 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.740
 I was pushing it towards the edges 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.409
 you can see that with this size of 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.090
 circular cookie cutter a little 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:47.010
 larger than the top of the 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.230
 copp that once they put on the 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.569
 cut fondant circle covers them 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.459
 perfectly your cupcake once you 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:55.319
 feel satisfied that your fondant 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:57.480
 it is well put they are given a soft 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.670
 pat with the palm of your hand and what 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.849
 soften well they should end with a 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.590
 beautiful white dome like this now you 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:07.319
 let's put the little ears to the kitten 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.689
 so is the remainder of the white background 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:12.060
 we took two pieces of more or less 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:14.790
 the same size to make two balls 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.680
 about the size of a few peas to me 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.299
 I like to do both together for 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.310
 to be able to see what I am doing and 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.310
 make sure they are the same size 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:28.479
 I make a small ball and with my finger I give it the 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.479
 shape like a cone 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.910
 I do the same with the other one a ball 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.409
 and then I make the shape of a cone of a 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.689
 tear 

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:41.769
 they're going to put a water no 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:41.769
 they want to put a lot 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.180
 I put a little droplet over here 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:51.129
 and another little droplet for the little ears 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.259
 from hello kitty 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:55.800
 I press the little ears a little 

00:04:53.259 --> 00:04:55.800
 the coke 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:05.010
 perfect the water will serve as glue 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:07.370
 for the little ears they just crush them 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.370
 little bit 

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.880
 and there they have hello ears 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.720
 kitty 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:16.400
 now we are going to draw his whiskers 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:20.300
 I take the cocktail stick or toothpicks 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:22.729
 and dipped it in the black liquid dye 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.860
 can use edible marker if 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:28.160
 they get or melted dark chocolate 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:30.770
 but this is the easiest option 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:34.210
 then I dip the toothpick and dragged it 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:36.910
 on the fondant with firm hand 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.919
 sometimes it helps to swing your hand over 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:42.509
 the surface or work table while 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:42.509
 they make these little mustaches 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:59.960
 and there they have the cute whiskers of the 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.960
 kitten 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:05.590
 well now let's do the bow with 

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:05.590
 the fondant or red 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.330
 He pulled a bit like the same 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:15.410
 size that starts for the ears and 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.410
 I make a little ball 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:20.740
 and then with my finger I give it the form 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:23.850
 the one of a mani pressing a little on the 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.850
 medium in this way 

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:30.249
 and with the handle of my brush I make some 

00:06:26.989 --> 00:06:30.249
 slits in the center 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:34.889
 this gives us the base form for the bow 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.860
 and with the smallest bit we do the 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:42.199
 center cited 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:44.930
 we make a small ball and roll it in 

00:06:42.199 --> 00:06:47.240
 sausage shape 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:49.820
 we put a drop of water in it 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:52.009
 center of the appointment and we hit the center 

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:55.000
 of acid 

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:57.730
 and the bow is ready 

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.180
 Now I put a drop of water under 

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:03.360
 hello kitty ear 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:05.819
 and I put the bow in its place 

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:08.310
 and now to finish the face leaves the 

00:07:05.819 --> 00:07:12.940
 'u' kit and I put a 

00:07:08.310 --> 00:07:16.920
 two and three dots of water 

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:20.660
 and I put the mini mym 

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:20.660
 the browns for your eyes 

00:07:23.689 --> 00:07:29.569
 and the yellow for your nose make sure 

00:07:27.169 --> 00:07:31.369
 to put the mma letters towards 

00:07:29.569 --> 00:07:34.080
 down can use melted chocolate 

00:07:31.369 --> 00:07:36.750
 for the eyes if they want 

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:39.360
 and here they have their fantastic cupcakes 

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:42.210
 hello kitty really easy 

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:45.810
 do and very effective to impress 

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:48.350
 Thank you very much for seeing us 

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:48.350
