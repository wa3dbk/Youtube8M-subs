00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.410 
need for the we're going back to
grayscale<00:02:55.540> here<00:02:56.430> and<00:02:57.430> we're<00:02:58.180> going<00:02:58.329> to

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
grayscale here and we're going to

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:05.580 
grayscale here and we're going to
indexed<00:02:59.049> collars<00:03:04.049> okay<00:03:05.049> let<00:03:05.200> me<00:03:05.290> just<00:03:05.440> make

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
indexed collars okay let me just make

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.920 
indexed collars okay let me just make
sure<00:03:05.650> all<00:03:06.489> right<00:03:06.790> then<00:03:07.060> we're<00:03:07.209> going<00:03:07.450> to<00:03:07.480> save

to your EOS digital card and go to crop

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.000 
to your EOS digital card and go to crop
marks<00:03:18.700> and<00:03:19.500> we're<00:03:20.500> gonna<00:03:20.680> save<00:03:21.099> that<00:03:21.130> there

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
marks and we're gonna save that there

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.210 
marks and we're gonna save that there
8-bit<00:03:24.010> windows<00:03:25.049> and<00:03:26.049> I'll<00:03:26.650> show<00:03:26.919> you<00:03:26.980> what

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
8-bit windows and I'll show you what

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.970 
8-bit windows and I'll show you what
that<00:03:27.250> looks<00:03:27.579> like<00:03:27.669> on<00:03:27.790> the<00:03:28.060> camera<00:03:28.500> okay<00:03:29.500> so

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
that looks like on the camera okay so

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:36.960 
that looks like on the camera okay so
I'm<00:03:30.400> gonna<00:03:30.549> and<00:03:30.819> flip<00:03:31.090> on<00:03:31.239> the<00:03:31.389> camera<00:03:35.970> I'm

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
I'm gonna and flip on the camera I'm

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:44.509 
I'm gonna and flip on the camera I'm
gonna<00:03:37.449> go<00:03:37.660> ahead<00:03:37.780> and<00:03:39.329> go<00:03:40.329> to<00:03:40.359> my<00:03:40.480> crop<00:03:40.870> marks

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.720 

then<00:03:45.519> I'm<00:03:45.790> gonna<00:03:45.940> load<00:03:46.750> up<00:03:46.780> that<00:03:47.220> crop<00:03:48.220> mark<00:03:48.519> we

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
then I'm gonna load up that crop mark we

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:56.369 
then I'm gonna load up that crop mark we
just<00:03:48.760> made<00:03:50.069> and<00:03:51.540> as<00:03:52.540> you<00:03:52.870> can<00:03:53.049> see<00:03:53.109> I<00:03:54.690> mean<00:03:55.690> zoom

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:56.379 
just made and as you can see I mean zoom

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:03.259 
just made and as you can see I mean zoom
and<00:03:56.709> just<00:03:57.190> lightly<00:03:58.680> as<00:03:59.680> I'm<00:03:59.919> moving<00:04:00.310> around

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:08.539 

you<00:04:04.269> can<00:04:04.480> see<00:04:05.319> that<00:04:05.620> it's<00:04:06.370> an<00:04:06.609> overlay<00:04:07.209> like<00:04:08.109> as

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:08.549 
you can see that it's an overlay like as

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:12.140 
you can see that it's an overlay like as
transparency<00:04:09.840> that's<00:04:10.840> what<00:04:11.139> that<00:04:11.319> dithering

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
transparency that's what that dithering

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.390 
transparency that's what that dithering
allowed<00:04:13.150> us<00:04:13.419> was<00:04:13.750> that<00:04:14.190> transparency<00:04:15.190> that

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
allowed us was that transparency that

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.199 
allowed us was that transparency that
was<00:04:15.579> here

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
was here

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.190 
was here
I<00:04:16.239> think<00:04:17.200> I'm<00:04:17.349> not<00:04:17.469> totally<00:04:17.739> sure<00:04:17.950> I<00:04:18.870> was<00:04:19.870> given

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
I think I'm not totally sure I was given

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.020 
I think I'm not totally sure I was given
very<00:04:20.229> vague

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
very vague

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
transparency and like you know I was

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.790 
transparency and like you know I was
gonna<00:05:03.250> use<00:05:03.490> it<00:05:03.520> to<00:05:03.760> like<00:05:03.880> compose<00:05:04.330> the<00:05:05.260> shot<00:05:05.290> to

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
gonna use it to like compose the shot to

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.640 
gonna use it to like compose the shot to
where<00:05:05.890> I<00:05:05.950> can<00:05:06.430> like<00:05:06.550> tell<00:05:06.850> my<00:05:07.110> extras<00:05:08.110> to<00:05:08.290> go<00:05:08.470> in

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
where I can like tell my extras to go in

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.320 
where I can like tell my extras to go in
and<00:05:08.830> stand<00:05:09.100> over<00:05:09.280> here<00:05:09.640> so<00:05:09.790> we<00:05:09.850> can<00:05:10.000> get<00:05:10.150> that

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
and stand over here so we can get that

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.630 
and stand over here so we can get that
correct<00:05:10.810> you<00:05:11.500> know<00:05:11.620> perspective<00:05:12.220> and<00:05:12.400> I<00:05:12.460> have

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:12.640 
correct you know perspective and I have

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.270 
correct you know perspective and I have
this<00:05:12.960> it's<00:05:13.960> a<00:05:14.110> girl<00:05:14.380> that's<00:05:14.710> walking<00:05:14.950> right

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 
this it's a girl that's walking right

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.960 
this it's a girl that's walking right
here<00:05:15.310> and<00:05:15.790> I<00:05:16.060> can<00:05:16.540> sort<00:05:16.930> of<00:05:17.050> you<00:05:17.200> know

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
here and I can sort of you know

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:23.070 
here and I can sort of you know
approximate<00:05:18.970> how<00:05:21.030> what<00:05:22.030> size<00:05:22.330> the<00:05:22.570> you<00:05:22.960> know

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
approximate how what size the you know

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.130 
approximate how what size the you know
the<00:05:23.290> extras<00:05:23.830> should<00:05:24.490> look<00:05:24.760> and<00:05:25.030> like<00:05:25.180> you<00:05:26.020> know

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:26.140 
the extras should look and like you know

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.070 
the extras should look and like you know
in<00:05:26.380> relation<00:05:26.770> to<00:05:26.800> where<00:05:27.010> they're<00:05:27.190> standing

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
in relation to where they're standing

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.870 
in relation to where they're standing
and<00:05:29.080> so<00:05:29.620> that's<00:05:29.830> why<00:05:30.040> I'm<00:05:30.190> going<00:05:30.430> to<00:05:30.580> use<00:05:30.700> it

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
and so that's why I'm going to use it

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:36.000 
and so that's why I'm going to use it
for<00:05:32.460> kind<00:05:33.460> of<00:05:33.490> surprised<00:05:33.880> that<00:05:34.530> this<00:05:35.530> feature

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.010 
for kind of surprised that this feature

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:40.730 
for kind of surprised that this feature
hasn't<00:05:36.580> been<00:05:36.700> like<00:05:36.880> implemented<00:05:37.630> yet<00:05:38.280> like<00:05:39.280> I

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
hasn't been like implemented yet like I

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.230 
hasn't been like implemented yet like I
originally<00:05:41.740> like<00:05:42.250> try<00:05:42.520> to<00:05:42.550> get<00:05:42.820> it<00:05:42.940> on<00:05:43.060> the

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
originally like try to get it on the

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.480 
originally like try to get it on the
ghost<00:05:43.690> image<00:05:44.110> overlay<00:05:44.680> so<00:05:44.740> I<00:05:44.979> could<00:05:45.160> have<00:05:45.280> like

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 
ghost image overlay so I could have like

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:47.430 
ghost image overlay so I could have like
the<00:05:45.700> collar<00:05:45.970> and<00:05:46.180> everything<00:05:46.600> but<00:05:46.870> I<00:05:47.140> guess

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
the collar and everything but I guess

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:53.250 
the collar and everything but I guess
this<00:05:47.680> works<00:05:47.979> just<00:05:48.820> as<00:05:49.030> well<00:05:49.240> but<00:05:50.820> I<00:05:52.020> don't<00:05:53.020> know

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:53.260 
this works just as well but I don't know

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:57.140 
this works just as well but I don't know
if<00:05:53.350> someone<00:05:53.650> could<00:05:54.100> like<00:05:54.460> show<00:05:55.330> me<00:05:55.479> a<00:05:55.510> way<00:05:55.720> that

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150 
if someone could like show me a way that

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:03.210 
if someone could like show me a way that
it<00:05:58.150> would<00:05:58.270> be<00:05:58.300> easier<00:05:59.520> it's<00:06:00.520> like<00:06:00.700> maybe<00:06:02.220> or

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:03.220 
it would be easier it's like maybe or

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.880 
it would be easier it's like maybe or
just<00:06:03.370> maybe<00:06:03.520> a<00:06:03.669> way<00:06:03.910> to<00:06:03.940> get<00:06:04.840> some<00:06:05.110> color<00:06:05.470> into

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:05.890 
just maybe a way to get some color into

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:08.460 
just maybe a way to get some color into
this<00:06:06.039> maybe<00:06:06.430> earth<00:06:07.060> so<00:06:07.539> it<00:06:07.660> just<00:06:07.810> doesn't<00:06:08.169> look

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:08.470 
this maybe earth so it just doesn't look

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:12.990 
this maybe earth so it just doesn't look
as<00:06:09.180> bad<00:06:10.180> or<00:06:10.720> and<00:06:11.169> it's<00:06:11.919> like<00:06:12.160> whenever<00:06:12.760> I'd
