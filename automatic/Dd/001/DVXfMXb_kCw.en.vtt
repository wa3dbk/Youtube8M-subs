 what is he doing here first but 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:28.240
 why he's doing this is a year and a half 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:30.600
 just for info when I write if there 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.600
 were still 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.850
 like Pidal will you look there there 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.390
 someone looks at him in the process of 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.250
 watch this bitch to do well for you 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:53.350
 mouth it's good there that I recover everything 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:56.290
 what you put me basically fucking 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.390
 I could have really nina no but 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.980
 why is this thing you're 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:09.340
 relook to me this stuff left been released 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:12.490
 by his share in live dickie blow but his 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:20.070
 joystick it's broken in fact they 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:22.240
 were watching 6 points passing to god is 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.440
 annie lemay that it took place in his 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.440
 pseudo concatenation of accounts what 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:36.240
 it's a pd was a fag why I 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:36.240
 remain why no comment 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:43.980
 the lobby is really coming up it's 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.950
 try hard pumps that's all it is and 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.599
 campers indeed always added 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.640
 I've been through Hamburg but if you 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:03:02.069
 do a little fruit here this is a 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:03:03.569
 Chinese trap is not only in his eyes 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.909
 I'm sure I made a fucking 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.769
 of bach as and now you feel 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:10.859
 you can go from behind there is god 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.819
 who god he is there of a watch two 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:13.170
 good news the first is this 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.400
 who gives the second is that god is 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.379
 with me so that's nice 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.609
 ah no but the guys will be granted his can 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:19.459
 not finish as fast you are 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:22.019
 completely stupid 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:25.159
 mathieu not kill him bah yeah ben here 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:27.780
 but I say it to the pedals 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:29.099
 it pushes too much you see the thing is that 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.109
 that's it in fact in ten years the vector 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:32.700
 there you left right and got 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:34.109
 never said threw a knife it's worth 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.250
 better not throw it in fact it's better 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:36.540
 expect to approach most of the time 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.519
 we'll miss the in fact but that I you 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.870
 will tell when I will do the tutorial there 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.950
 because my next video will be that 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.019
 in fact it's going to be a next video 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.909
 it's going to be an introduction to my series 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.930
 the life inc for dummies and so he 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:50.879
 must of course make a good 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:53.359
 name gameplay back here I get my 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:53.359
 earlier potos 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.450
 I had time to go get my 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.550
 knife that was against the fence and 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.680
 horla completely on top of the guy 

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.090
 I completely chili and above 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.110
 I love what was not happening 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.250
 and so I said my next idea in 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.660
 does it so it's going to be the introduction a 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.040
 face lift for dummies I will comment 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.120
 a gameplay that I'm going to send a little 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.380
 subject elsewhere so that's it for 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.430
 speak of an infinite so basically the 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.040
 title his letter what is the iphone 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.180
 is not amoched not exactly how 

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.010
 I'm going to turn that out again maybe I 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.250
 just to talk a little better summarize a 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.290
 little 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.790
 from the beginning I do not really know 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.740
 I see there I say that while I even 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.640
 not see my little darling but his mill 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.650
 me no but it's good we did not win 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.390
 no agreement c enough hockey and for 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.460
 guen smooth which makes it 23 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:39.400
 it's great the haye has more dawn there 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:42.710
 good enough not that I said no 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:47.270
 so awesome this game this game it's jenny lee 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:48.470
 awesome this game I do what I do this 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.610
 way of doing it and that's until I fall 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.990
 in another lobby and I have nothing to 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.880
 fuck their party she will not start 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.220
 both the way before being lifted I 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:57.950
 look like there's a son of a bitch 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:59.150
 Well, go ahead, that's fine, I'm sure 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:00.979
 than tracks from your face in front 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.720
 the atlantic originated this summit that 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:05.990
 inspires me nothing that is really worth 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:08.800
 further on when you put a shot of 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.800
 knife with this shit 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:18.720
 no comments no comments on but it's 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.670
 cool 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.050
 as long as you're having fun this is what counts 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.580
 I did not even know this area 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.320
 on jelly I was still going to have gotten for 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:29.070
 kenge task - bmo this three or four 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:30.000
 times when I liked my TV 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.160
 to someone because he was still 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:37.440
 all before at the party what there 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:39.150
 have a mega booth when it plays 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:40.860
 to sounds sajoo is a tare its and 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.460
 I had said though optical origins I 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:43.460
 preach the 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:59.770
 this looks like amplification but 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:59.770
 look at me these lobbies so seriously 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:07.810
 I never have a crossman like that 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:10.630
 then what does that too is a 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:11.160
 ramps what he does that why he does 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:14.850
 it 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.850
 and what is it?
