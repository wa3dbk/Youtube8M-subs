descending portion of the Coleman okay

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.050 
descending portion of the Coleman okay
with<00:01:31.620> this<00:01:31.890> what<00:01:32.430> does<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.549> mean<00:01:32.820> with

with this what does that mean with
cancer<00:01:33.510> oh<00:01:33.780> good<00:01:34.290> question<00:01:34.440> cancer<00:01:35.400> is<00:01:35.430> a

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
cancer oh good question cancer is a

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.690 
cancer oh good question cancer is a
growth<00:01:36.630> that's<00:01:36.930> developed<00:01:37.650> by<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:37.890> body<00:01:38.310> and

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
growth that's developed by the body and

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.960 
growth that's developed by the body and
typically<00:01:39.210> is<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.479> healing<00:01:40.110> process<00:01:40.409> but<00:01:41.159> the

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
typically is a healing process but the

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.390 
typically is a healing process but the
body<00:01:42.330> finds<00:01:42.810> out<00:01:43.020> if<00:01:43.290> there<00:01:43.530> is<00:01:43.650> cancer<00:01:44.070> sends

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
body finds out if there is cancer sends

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.219 
body finds out if there is cancer sends
that<00:01:44.490> antibodies<00:01:45.150> and<00:01:45.330> typically<00:01:45.810> destroys

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
that antibodies and typically destroys

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.609 
that antibodies and typically destroys
it<00:01:46.640> sometimes<00:01:47.640> cancer<00:01:48.150> is<00:01:48.360> not<00:01:48.420> found<00:01:49.140> at<00:01:49.439> any

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
it sometimes cancer is not found at any

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.850 
it sometimes cancer is not found at any
grows<00:01:50.119> and<00:01:51.119> so<00:01:51.450> we<00:01:51.600> grew<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:51.900> room<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.680> grew

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
grows and so we grew a room you grew

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.820 
grows and so we grew a room you grew
inside<00:01:53.299> we<00:01:54.299> do<00:01:54.479> need<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.750> take<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:54.960> PET<00:01:55.470> scan

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
inside we do need to take a PET scan

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.580 
inside we do need to take a PET scan
which<00:01:56.159> would<00:01:56.580> be<00:01:56.760> a<00:01:57.000> test<00:01:57.840> for<00:01:57.900> they<00:01:58.080> injected

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
which would be a test for they injected

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.920 
which would be a test for they injected
died<00:01:58.770> in<00:01:58.979> your<00:01:59.130> body<00:01:59.340> scan<00:02:00.299> your<00:02:00.420> body<00:02:00.479> that

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
died in your body scan your body that

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.109 
died in your body scan your body that
part<00:02:01.200> will<00:02:01.350> be<00:02:01.380> painless<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.490> we'll<00:02:02.909> be<00:02:03.030> able

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
part will be painless and we'll be able

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.030 
part will be painless and we'll be able
to<00:02:03.240> see<00:02:03.479> if<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.720> cancer<00:02:03.930> has<00:02:04.110> moved<00:02:04.619> outside

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
to see if the cancer has moved outside

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.020 
to see if the cancer has moved outside
of<00:02:05.909> your<00:02:06.090> intestines<00:02:06.810> well<00:02:07.439> how<00:02:07.619> did

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
that typically it's valiant obesity but

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.030 
that typically it's valiant obesity but
I<00:02:13.010> could<00:02:13.190> also<00:02:13.340> be<00:02:13.550> caused<00:02:13.760> by<00:02:14.090> smoking<00:02:15.040> eating

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
I could also be caused by smoking eating

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.890 
I could also be caused by smoking eating
