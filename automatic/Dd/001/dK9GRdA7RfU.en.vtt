 and so what hi dear friends with 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.599
 By your camp, I decided to bring to 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.029
 logical conclusion a kind of crap 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.420
 recognized by more space by my squares 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:24.060
 nice but you portals wap wap wap vata 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.220
 cotton wool nibbled cotton wool very 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.730
 gnawed and and plenty 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.740
 cane yes I'm here 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.440
 complete this whole body because well i'm not 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.540
 whole butter spray honestly light spoon 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.600
 I know how much effort there will be in the 100 sphere 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.770
 he will have something that is understandable without knowing 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.290
 I can't do it 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.079
 maybe I'll learn later but now 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.590
 and I decided that is all yes logical 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:53.610
 completion and that i felt it all 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.770
 set fire to blow but fixed talked 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.140
 end it all you can blow it 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.050
 remove all I do not know throw here 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.190
 leave basically reached quite good 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.790
 I have real results 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.619
 diamond pickaxe with efficiency and this 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:13.890
 I think good and well, 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:19.259
 on just threw okay dynamite to me 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:21.840
 it is necessary cheat mod drove so here it is all 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.119
 deal and let's add third all i 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.920
 I think that this will be the most logical 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.020
 completion 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.540
 I will of course also have a card 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.909
 even i don't know why but i left in 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.030
 description even go to my basement 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.799
 which I did not give how much was 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.619
 plans but i don't know i don't like i can't 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.770
 take it to me it seems 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:45.380
 uninteresting because it is uninteresting 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:48.409
 you can do something all 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.420
 issuing another I do not know the case you can not 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.789
 but I can't play you 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.700
 what about me then maybe I will even start 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:57.649
 same display dias but not now on 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.539
 now i don't know but i have no idea 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:02.539
 take advantage of some interesting not 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:05.720
 here are just adventures it is 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:09.050
 uninteresting and counting WAIT WAIT 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:14.209
 it's all interesting at home and catch fire and 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:19.610
 will he wait for a dynamite fatal fire 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:23.110
 Gregory's fatal fire ring which I 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:26.540
 couldn't do everything 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.250
 the head of the world happened a little earlier 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.340
 than I thought well, that's basically so 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:33.650
 beautiful so beautiful picture can 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.290
 still to enchant and shovel no pickaxe 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.630
 excellent also the pickaxe charmed on 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:42.860
 strength by the way nicely enchanted so 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:48.920
 oh well i still remember my displays 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:51.560
 that there was somewhere in my cave 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.630
 some minerals fly off 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:58.220
 there and there too we will try something 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:03:01.959
 find or blow up all the reviews 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:04.430
 drove so still this place must be found 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:08.060
 instead place place place place place 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.950
 places instead of pa pa pa pa pam so by 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.060
 my, I already translate to serve some 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:17.120
 the jungle begins and here is the hike 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:19.220
 although here as special forces as a terminator 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.220
 so jumps to the ground and all the blocks 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:25.130
 breaks under them or there should be a bit dark 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:28.489
 torches need torch torch torch and not even 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.569
 remember the day and honestly yes here's the torch on 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:32.390
 tripod 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:33.519
 so much though you know the password from the face 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.109
 password 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:38.599
 I understood there was a lot of water where we 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:39.079
 water water water water creeper creeper and 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:43.069
 skilet 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:44.930
 skeleton creepers spider skeleton creeper no 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:47.689
 kryptonite hand sorry here water see 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:51.370
 water but in my opinion there is no water that we 

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:54.319
 need or this is not the water that we need 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:58.419
 I already about this place will not find where I am 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:58.419
 hid and not several times died 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:06.950
 okay okay, here it is already like this 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:10.219
 in my here and all the time went like that a 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:14.870
 But our water here is even puma or 

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:18.440
 tonino or is it ok 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:21.349
 I think then I was not really a table than 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:24.349
 burned down and give me this place 

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:25.310
 he came out very interesting at all 

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:28.340
 one from where 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:32.090
 but these buildings of mine should be 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.740
 blown come on come on come on more 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.590

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:39.490
 more likes then see what I do 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:42.889
 I have not yet collected a method where it says that 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:44.449
 emerald seems kind of liberal here 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:45.830
 somewhere when going up I thought his 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:48.440
 No, I was noticed right away 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:52.190
 my sensor joe patney would work right away 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:55.449
 instantly but unfortunately there is no 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:58.880
 myrold ​​it may have been this coal 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:01.039
 it's possible to give even so 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.590
 let's see what this decided I lost yet 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:06.080
 what else is this this this to the mines 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:09.050
 abandoned mine still there will be mine 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:12.320
 There was a chest with lapis lazuli still here 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:15.380
 turns on spavner zombie okay to 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:17.539
 It was basically a good place, but I like 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.310
 already said card leave you leave you 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:21.009

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:53.840
 of course it's only visually if 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:56.360
 dig thats much more but in 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:59.150
 In principle, I think you should not be upset 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:01.699
 that I ended up standing like that 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:03.319
 in a way because but really 

00:06:01.699 --> 00:06:05.539
