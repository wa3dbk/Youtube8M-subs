00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.130 
I spent a lot of time sanding this to
level<00:02:50.340> out<00:02:50.490> any<00:02:50.730> of<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:50.970> uneven<00:02:51.300> surfaces

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
level out any of the uneven surfaces

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.690 
level out any of the uneven surfaces
I'll<00:02:52.350> probably<00:02:52.590> still<00:02:52.890> come<00:02:53.070> back<00:02:53.250> to<00:02:53.430> it<00:02:53.580> and

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
I'll probably still come back to it and

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.580 
I'll probably still come back to it and
do<00:02:53.820> some<00:02:54.090> finer<00:02:54.450> sanding<00:02:55.110> once<00:02:55.290> it's<00:02:55.470> all

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
do some finer sanding once it's all

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.290 
do some finer sanding once it's all
assembled<00:02:56.100> here<00:02:56.460> I'm<00:02:56.610> finding<00:02:56.850> the<00:02:57.090> center

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
assembled here I'm finding the center

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:11.710 
assembled here I'm finding the center
point<00:02:57.690> and<00:02:57.870> drawing<00:02:58.350> a<00:02:58.440> circle

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.270 

I'm<00:03:12.720> building<00:03:13.080> the<00:03:13.170> entire<00:03:13.440> base<00:03:13.770> and<00:03:14.070> legs

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
I'm building the entire base and legs

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.560 
I'm building the entire base and legs
out<00:03:14.550> of<00:03:14.670> two<00:03:14.850> bikers<00:03:16.880> I'm<00:03:17.880> cutting<00:03:18.270> all<00:03:18.390> of<00:03:18.420> my

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
out of two bikers I'm cutting all of my

out of two bikers I'm cutting all of my
pieces<00:03:18.780> to<00:03:18.960> their<00:03:19.170> exact<00:03:19.620> dimensions<00:03:20.190> using

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
pieces to their exact dimensions using

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.560 
pieces to their exact dimensions using
my<00:03:20.610> table-saw

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.270 

I'm<00:03:24.570> going<00:03:24.900> to<00:03:24.960> join<00:03:25.170> all<00:03:25.500> of<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:25.770> center

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
I'm going to join all of the center

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.100 
I'm going to join all of the center
pieces<00:03:26.520> together<00:03:26.850> using<00:03:27.240> half<00:03:27.690> lap<00:03:28.080> joints

pieces together using half lap joints
and<00:03:29.040> all<00:03:29.220> that<00:03:29.700> means<00:03:30.030> is<00:03:30.300> I'm<00:03:30.600> going<00:03:30.750> to<00:03:30.840> cut

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
and all that means is I'm going to cut

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.050 
and all that means is I'm going to cut
out<00:03:31.290> a<00:03:31.320> large<00:03:32.040> notch

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.670 
half the thickness of the wood in each
piece<00:03:35.850> I<00:03:36.180> can<00:03:36.480> make<00:03:36.690> sure<00:03:36.720> it's<00:03:36.990> centered<00:03:37.290> by

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
piece I can make sure it's centered by

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.040 
piece I can make sure it's centered by
flipping<00:03:38.190> the<00:03:38.430> board<00:03:38.670> in<00:03:38.880> to<00:03:39.210> end<00:03:39.450> and<00:03:39.810> using

those<00:03:55.430> two<00:03:55.670> notches<00:03:55.910> just<00:03:56.210> interlocked

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
those two notches just interlocked

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.910 
those two notches just interlocked
without<00:03:59.510> changing<00:03:59.930> my<00:03:59.960> blades<00:04:00.350> I<00:04:00.530> can<00:04:00.680> cut

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
without changing my blades I can cut

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:06.000 
without changing my blades I can cut
rabbets<00:04:01.220> in<00:04:01.580> the<00:04:01.670> ends<00:04:02.090> of<00:04:02.210> the<00:04:02.360> top<00:04:02.600> boards

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.620 

I'll<00:04:07.010> start<00:04:07.310> the<00:04:07.430> assembly<00:04:07.910> by<00:04:08.090> gluing<00:04:08.510> these

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
I'll start the assembly by gluing these

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:15.220 
I'll start the assembly by gluing these
cross<00:04:09.020> pieces<00:04:09.320> together<00:04:13.870> and<00:04:14.870> I'm<00:04:15.050> also

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
cross pieces together and I'm also

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.229 
cross pieces together and I'm also
putting<00:04:15.470> some<00:04:15.770> screws<00:04:16.280> in<00:04:16.580> I<00:04:16.730> just<00:04:16.910> don't<00:04:17.090> want

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
putting some screws in I just don't want

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.090 
putting some screws in I just don't want
to<00:04:17.269> put<00:04:17.450> any<00:04:17.570> screws<00:04:17.959> in<00:04:18.140> the<00:04:18.350> middle<00:04:18.769> where<00:04:19.070> I

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
to put any screws in the middle where I

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.820 
to put any screws in the middle where I
need<00:04:19.310> to<00:04:19.430> drill<00:04:19.700> a<00:04:19.730> hole<00:04:20.030> for<00:04:20.060> the<00:04:20.390> umbrella<00:04:20.840> to

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:21.830 
need to drill a hole for the umbrella to

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:23.290 
need to drill a hole for the umbrella to
assemble<00:04:22.220> the<00:04:22.310> base<00:04:22.520> I'm<00:04:22.730> going<00:04:22.820> to<00:04:22.880> start<00:04:23.150> by

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
assemble the base I'm going to start by

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.720 
assemble the base I'm going to start by
attaching<00:04:23.600> the<00:04:23.810> legs<00:04:24.200> to<00:04:24.620> the<00:04:24.860> lower<00:04:25.190> cross

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 
attaching the legs to the lower cross

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:37.240 
attaching the legs to the lower cross
brace<00:04:26.180> I<00:04:35.650> decided<00:04:36.650> this<00:04:36.800> needed<00:04:37.100> some

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
brace I decided this needed some

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.250 
brace I decided this needed some
clamping<00:04:37.790> pressure<00:04:37.850> also<00:04:38.420> to<00:04:38.750> help<00:04:38.990> draw

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
clamping pressure also to help draw

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.850 
clamping pressure also to help draw
these<00:04:39.500> joints<00:04:40.040> together<00:04:41.140> this<00:04:42.140> cross<00:04:42.500> brace

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
these joints together this cross brace

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:57.610 
these joints together this cross brace
drops<00:04:43.250> down<00:04:43.490> into<00:04:43.760> these<00:04:44.030> rabbits

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.529 

these<00:04:58.620> one<00:04:58.919> and<00:04:59.069> a<00:04:59.129> half<00:04:59.340> inch<00:04:59.610> diameter<00:04:59.909> holes

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:00.539 
these one and a half inch diameter holes

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:09.170 
these one and a half inch diameter holes
are<00:05:00.810> for<00:05:00.990> the<00:05:01.080> umbrella<00:05:07.580> the<00:05:08.580> idea<00:05:08.879> here<00:05:09.150> is

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
are for the umbrella the idea here is

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.360 
are for the umbrella the idea here is
that<00:05:09.419> the<00:05:09.569> tabletop<00:05:10.349> will<00:05:10.680> rest<00:05:10.949> on<00:05:11.189> this

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
that the tabletop will rest on this

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.490 
that the tabletop will rest on this
rabbit<00:05:12.060> rather<00:05:12.330> than<00:05:12.629> on<00:05:12.780> these<00:05:13.020> thinner

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
rabbit rather than on these thinner

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.189 
rabbit rather than on these thinner
slats<00:05:14.099> the<00:05:14.520> way<00:05:14.969> that<00:05:15.150> fits<00:05:15.449> in<00:05:15.629> there<00:05:15.990> I<00:05:16.020> don't

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199 
slats the way that fits in there I don't

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:18.589 
slats the way that fits in there I don't
really<00:05:16.409> even<00:05:16.830> need<00:05:17.069> to<00:05:17.219> attach<00:05:17.610> the<00:05:17.909> top<00:05:18.180> but

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:18.599 
really even need to attach the top but

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:20.809 
really even need to attach the top but
I'm<00:05:18.689> going<00:05:18.810> to<00:05:18.870> put<00:05:18.990> one<00:05:19.289> screw<00:05:19.800> in<00:05:19.830> each<00:05:20.400> leg

00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:20.819 
I'm going to put one screw in each leg

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:30.670 
I'm going to put one screw in each leg
just<00:05:21.210> to<00:05:21.330> make<00:05:21.539> it<00:05:21.659> easier<00:05:22.050> to<00:05:22.199> move<00:05:22.349> around

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:30.680 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.409 

using<00:05:31.680> my<00:05:31.770> router<00:05:32.099> to<00:05:32.310> round<00:05:32.639> over<00:05:32.849> the<00:05:33.240> top

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:33.419 
using my router to round over the top

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:42.120 
using my router to round over the top
edge

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.130 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.010 

I'm<00:05:42.580> finishing<00:05:42.970> this<00:05:43.180> with<00:05:43.390> an<00:05:43.510> exterior

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:44.020 
I'm finishing this with an exterior

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:55.440 
I'm finishing this with an exterior
water-based<00:05:45.010> spar<00:05:45.700> urethane

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:55.450 

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.930 

I<00:05:55.710> think<00:05:56.710> three<00:05:56.950> coats<00:05:57.220> of<00:05:57.370> that<00:05:57.430> spar

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:57.940 
I think three coats of that spar

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.670 
I think three coats of that spar
urethane<00:05:58.180> is<00:05:58.510> really<00:05:58.900> going<00:05:59.020> to<00:05:59.110> protect<00:05:59.440> this

00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 
urethane is really going to protect this

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.320 
urethane is really going to protect this
redwood<00:05:59.980> from<00:06:00.460> the<00:06:00.550> weather<00:06:00.760> if<00:06:01.060> you'd<00:06:01.210> like
