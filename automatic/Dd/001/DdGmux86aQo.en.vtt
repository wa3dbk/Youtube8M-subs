00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
bathing suit in the Jean so I would

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.800 
bathing suit in the Jean so I would
learn<00:04:24.150> and<00:04:24.509> then

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
learn and then

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.680 
learn and then
show<00:04:24.900> me<00:04:25.169> and<00:04:25.380> correct<00:04:25.710> me<00:04:26.040> and<00:04:27.030> I<00:04:27.090> would<00:04:27.540> buy

magazines to learn from other models so

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.750 
magazines to learn from other models so
I<00:04:31.139> think<00:04:31.290> that's<00:04:31.950> very<00:04:32.040> important<00:04:32.610> because

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
I think that's very important because

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.390 
I think that's very important because
you<00:04:32.970> have<00:04:33.000> to<00:04:33.270> learn<00:04:34.080> somehow<00:04:34.590> you<00:04:34.770> just<00:04:35.040> you

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
you have to learn somehow you just you

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.860 
you have to learn somehow you just you
don't<00:04:35.490> just<00:04:35.730> come<00:04:35.970> and<00:04:36.210> like<00:04:36.360> know

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
don't just come and like know

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.120 
don't just come and like know
immediately<00:04:37.260> what<00:04:37.650> to<00:04:37.770> do

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
immediately what to do

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:40.640 
immediately what to do
it<00:04:38.639> comes<00:04:38.940> with<00:04:39.150> time<00:04:39.360> and<00:04:39.540> practice<00:04:39.690> it's

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
it comes with time and practice it's

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.190 
it comes with time and practice it's
their<00:04:40.830> fashion<00:04:41.400> for<00:04:41.639> moves<00:04:41.880> as<00:04:42.090> well<00:04:42.120> uh<00:04:42.720> I

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
their fashion for moves as well uh I

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.260 
their fashion for moves as well uh I
think<00:04:43.350> everything<00:04:44.070> goes<00:04:44.280> in<00:04:44.610> fashion<00:04:45.060> I<00:04:45.240> think

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
think everything goes in fashion I think

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:50.960 
think everything goes in fashion I think
it's<00:04:45.570> more<00:04:48.800> like<00:04:49.800> until<00:04:50.220> very<00:04:50.430> recently<00:04:50.880> it

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
it's more like until very recently it

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.180 
it's more like until very recently it
was<00:04:51.120> all<00:04:51.270> about<00:04:51.389> the<00:04:51.720> movements<00:04:52.410> like<00:04:52.560> jumping

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190

in<00:04:53.400> a<00:04:53.520> photo<00:04:53.760> and<00:04:54.060> then<00:04:54.150> the<00:04:54.300> photographer

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
in a photo and then the photographer

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.960 
in a photo and then the photographer
catches<00:04:55.350> you<00:04:55.470> up<00:04:55.620> in<00:04:55.800> the<00:04:55.919> air<00:04:56.070> so<00:04:56.490> your<00:04:56.730> hair

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
catches you up in the air so your hair

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.409 
catches you up in the air so your hair
moves<00:04:57.320> you're<00:04:58.320> above<00:04:58.979> the<00:04:59.220> ground<00:04:59.490> and<00:05:00.000> that
