00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:10.910
 so I already completed the last row of all 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:15.389
 I have 4 and no two three three 4 5 rows without 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:17.730
 The additions turned out like this 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.810
 as if a basket, that is, there are windows 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.859
 but 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:25.910
 keep it all the same should 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:30.650
 somehow on a stool so i will do 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:34.680
 four pairs of strings to 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:39.300
 tether to the stool for this when i 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.820
 finished here here a row did not 3 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.960
 air loops as usual from 30 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:50.820
 air loops 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:58.230
 let's check these 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:01:01.260
 14 15 16 17 19 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 and 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.949
 even 31 on the rise because I will 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.869
 do now without crotch so 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:11.460
 like these are posts without crochet then through 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:18.290
 I make one loop from the beginning of the hook 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:18.290
 first puncture and went to the bottom 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:28.150
 in fact, such stripes will need to be 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.150
 make 8 pieces 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:41.520
 around the perimeter you can calculate 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:54.630
 exactly half then a quarter where you 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.630
 should make your strings 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.240
 generally knit so until the end of the row
