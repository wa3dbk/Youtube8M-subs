00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:06.089
 good to everyone 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.089
 the video file has been a long time 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.650
 because I have not captured life the 

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:12.980
 life and this I do not like absolutely 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.919
 how it records 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:21.070
 but good about this short video for 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:21.070
 give you hope for one thing 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:29.170
 so I observed watching 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.170
 dragon scales boots 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.610
 and you think you have everything interesting they are 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.120
 a normal boots what is interesting is 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.610
 this 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.450
 that I have real 92 but I do not have any 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:46.140
 offer put I have not even the first 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:49.260
 you see here you can dragon trainers 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.579
 but I do not have it I have 92 of 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.640
 blacksmithing and this is of consideration 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:58.089
 you will be asking how the conceived 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:01.359
 Well, a long time ago in a normal game 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:04.930
 it is not it is also getting the 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:08.700
 erico's war hammer and neither 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:12.280
 I had thought of blacksmithing 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.120
 I've got this 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.570
 here 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:21.100
 peak of the blood of the ancients for 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:25.000
 that you have an idea here you are working 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:28.500
 here dead just right below mortal 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.500
 and got nothing in it 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:37.870
 Well, this is curious for those who 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.440
 you want 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.440
 but 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:46.890
 or rather to make our 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:50.920
 plans like that in plan or I want to put 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.390
 a few perchÃ© in the robbery and 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.390
 we make putting in the smithy away 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:59.850
 Now that you know you can get 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:02.330
 all armor without the need of 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.210
 have the review 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:08.830
 it's possible you might have something that 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.830
 see this here 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:16.319
 It is open around hard 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:18.290
 and I have fuck because and seekers of 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.670
 treasures 50 percent more than 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.239
 odds of finding objects in 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.220
 specials in the booty worth 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:29.790
 it's possible that that has something to do 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.790
 with this but honestly I doubt it 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.950
 because the game I had a long time ago 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:40.349
 time I got the ico's hammer 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:42.180
 I did not have it I did not have any near 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:44.609
 of opening locks 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.890
 so I just give you a little 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:50.519
 hopes that you can get the 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.890
 eric as and dragon armor without 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:55.170
 want none but nothing more for this 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.760
 video next week will go look at the 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.280
 hard capture of video to see if I have 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.379
 lucky and I like it and I buy it and about 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.090
 many videos that I'm really looking forward to 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:05.400
 to teach you things that I'm discovering 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.659
 I on my own part not us 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.010
 same 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:13.250
 well that it goes well to all and even 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.250
 other
