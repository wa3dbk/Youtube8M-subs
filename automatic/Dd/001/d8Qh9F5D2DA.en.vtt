00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.520
 hours more or less publish them four 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.220
 hot studies in their criteria that they will 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.710
 they are working on a version of 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.550
 minecraft for all consoles based 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.460
 in version 1.6 point 4 he left 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:23.550
 then we were going to version 1.6 point 4 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.310
 in a PC way and we get all the 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.159
 things that it brings that will practically be the 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.550
 next update that will be for 

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:34.620
 way of consoles and in that 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.219
 update apparently according to study 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.769
 when he brings witches horse drive 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.739
 light panels 3 enough things and good 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:47.129
 we would have to observe well in detail 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:51.480
 the things that brings the 1.6 point 4 that is 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.890
 prior to 1.7 point 21 points 0.1 but 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.019
 brings many many things I think a 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.840
 I'm going to look for it to see if I can 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:59.240
 see her 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.690
 that is, it is open by the way 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.180
 starting to enter now 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.369
 let's touch the full list if it's 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.780
 that is around here I think we have many 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:10.830
 more things 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.810
 in this version of well do not place them 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.250
 the mods that drop things like 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.530
 you kill them for example when they walk 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.729
 swords and in the armor helmet when 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.729
 the bushes drop all that 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:28.640
 is the update I still think that 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:32.060
