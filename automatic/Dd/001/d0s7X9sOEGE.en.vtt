knife and really when I look at the
Endura<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:50.010> see<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:51.739> slim<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:52.949> portable

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370

tactical knife I know many people like
to<00:00:56.070> EDC<00:00:56.399> this<00:00:56.730> one<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.180> it's<00:00:57.809> because<00:00:58.109> it<00:00:58.199> is

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
to EDC this one and it's because it is

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.349 
to EDC this one and it's because it is
so<00:00:58.500> lightweight<00:00:58.800> for<00:00:59.370> its<00:00:59.489> size<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.699> slim

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
so lightweight for its size and slim

kind of EDC tasks like this dragonfly
the<00:01:11.729> newseum<00:01:12.180> dura<00:01:12.360> as<00:01:12.659> maybe<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.530> dedicated

kind of defensive tool or or just for

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.030 
kind of defensive tool or or just for
larger<00:01:17.490> tasks<00:01:18.380> yeah<00:01:19.380> let's<00:01:19.590> take<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.770> closer

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
larger tasks yeah let's take a closer

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.679 
larger tasks yeah let's take a closer
look<00:01:20.159> at<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.430> blade<00:01:20.640> which<00:01:21.150> is<00:01:21.330> made<00:01:21.509> of

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
look at the blade which is made of

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.649 
look at the blade which is made of
Japanese<00:01:22.259> vg-10<00:01:23.040> this<00:01:24.030> is<00:01:24.210> actually<00:01:24.630> a

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
Japanese vg-10 this is actually a

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.850 
Japanese vg-10 this is actually a
Japanese<00:01:25.380> made<00:01:25.619> spyderco<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:26.689> the<00:01:27.689> steel<00:01:28.680> here

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
Japanese made spyderco so the steel here

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.100 
Japanese made spyderco so the steel here
makes<00:01:29.040> sense<00:01:29.340> what<00:01:30.210> we've<00:01:30.329> got<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:30.540> just<00:01:30.810> a

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
makes sense what we've got is just a

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.890 
makes sense what we've got is just a
typical<00:01:31.439> spyderco<00:01:32.159> drop-point<00:01:32.520> design<00:01:32.900> it's

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
typical spyderco drop-point design it's

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.620 
typical spyderco drop-point design it's
a<00:01:34.079> pretty<00:01:34.290> lean<00:01:34.680> looking<00:01:35.280> knife<00:01:35.509> there's<00:01:36.509> not

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
a pretty lean looking knife there's not

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.840 
a pretty lean looking knife there's not
a<00:01:36.689> lot<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:36.869> belly<00:01:37.110> to<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.320> blade<00:01:37.680> it's<00:01:38.460> really

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
a lot of belly to the blade it's really

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.850 
a lot of belly to the blade it's really
like<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:39.810> said<00:01:39.990> kind<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.290> being<00:01:40.439> pressed<00:01:40.710> into

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
like I said kind of being pressed into

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.800 
like I said kind of being pressed into
more<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.340> tactical<00:01:41.850> application<00:01:42.450> I<00:01:42.570> think

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
more of a tactical application I think

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.789 
more of a tactical application I think
for<00:01:43.020> this<00:01:43.110> this<00:01:43.710> kind<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:44.100> nice<00:01:44.310> intended<00:01:45.270> use

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
for this this kind of nice intended use

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.039 
for this this kind of nice intended use
you<00:01:46.799> can<00:01:46.920> see<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.369> blade<00:01:47.790> steel<00:01:48.060> here<00:01:48.390> it

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
you can see the blade steel here it

handles<00:03:55.659> quite<00:03:55.870> well<00:03:56.109> like<00:03:56.290> this<00:03:56.470> to<00:03:56.680> which

00:03:56.969 --> 00:03:56.979 
handles quite well like this to which

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:58.830 
handles quite well like this to which
you've<00:03:57.159> got<00:03:57.370> is<00:03:57.519> essentially<00:03:58.209> a<00:03:58.239> folding<00:03:58.720> ice

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840

this<00:05:45.610> pivot<00:05:46.029> and<00:05:46.169> eliminate<00:05:47.169> that<00:05:47.349> but<00:05:47.650> you're

00:05:48.119 --> 00:05:48.129 
this pivot and eliminate that but you're

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:51.480 
this pivot and eliminate that but you're
going<00:05:48.279> to<00:05:48.339> get<00:05:48.400> slightly<00:05:49.740> stiffer<00:05:50.740> deployment

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:51.490 
going to get slightly stiffer deployment

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:53.339 
going to get slightly stiffer deployment
and<00:05:51.550> I<00:05:52.150> prefer<00:05:52.539> just<00:05:52.659> having<00:05:52.990> some<00:05:53.169> smooth

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:53.349 
and I prefer just having some smooth

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:56.249 
and I prefer just having some smooth
smooth<00:05:53.979> deployment<00:05:54.550> on<00:05:54.699> it<00:05:54.849> so<00:05:55.089> so<00:05:55.960> I<00:05:55.990> just

00:05:56.249 --> 00:05:56.259 
smooth deployment on it so so I just

00:05:56.259 --> 00:05:58.619 
smooth deployment on it so so I just
loosened<00:05:56.889> it<00:05:56.979> up<00:05:57.039> a<00:05:57.159> little<00:05:57.279> bit<00:05:57.490> so<00:05:57.699> that's

00:05:58.619 --> 00:05:58.629 
loosened it up a little bit so that's

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:00.510 
loosened it up a little bit so that's
one<00:05:58.900> of<00:05:58.930> the<00:05:59.080> drawbacks<00:05:59.229> with<00:05:59.979> some<00:06:00.339> of<00:06:00.430> these
