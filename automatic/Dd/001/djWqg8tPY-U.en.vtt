second<00:03:43.209> moisturizer<00:03:43.810> albeit<00:03:44.800> a<00:03:44.830> very

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
second moisturizer albeit a very

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:47.460 
second moisturizer albeit a very
lightweight<00:03:45.550> moisturizer<00:03:46.540> on<00:03:46.750> a<00:03:46.810> bad<00:03:47.080> thing

lightweight moisturizer on a bad thing
but<00:03:47.770> if<00:03:47.980> you<00:03:48.100> are<00:03:48.280> looking<00:03:48.490> for<00:03:48.820> just

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
but if you are looking for just

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.760 
but if you are looking for just
increased<00:03:49.780> moisture<00:03:49.959> couldn't<00:03:50.530> you<00:03:50.620> maybe

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:50.770 
increased moisture couldn't you maybe

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:54.660 
increased moisture couldn't you maybe
just<00:03:50.920> use<00:03:51.340> a<00:03:51.370> moisturizer<00:03:52.240> that<00:03:52.480> has<00:03:52.950> a<00:03:53.950> little

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
just use a moisturizer that has a little

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.670 
just use a moisturizer that has a little
bit<00:03:54.790> more<00:03:55.000> thickness<00:03:55.209> to<00:03:55.870> it<00:03:56.050> you<00:03:56.260> know<00:03:56.380> if<00:03:56.560> you

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
bit more thickness to it you know if you

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.320 
bit more thickness to it you know if you
find<00:03:56.920> that<00:03:57.010> that's<00:03:57.130> what<00:03:57.340> your<00:03:57.459> skin<00:03:57.730> needs<00:03:57.760> as

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330
