00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
of it and things just get crazy like it

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.650 
of it and things just get crazy like it
looks<00:02:19.010> like<00:02:19.160> video<00:02:19.520> game<00:02:19.820> glitches<00:02:20.270> in<00:02:20.360> fact

it<00:02:21.590> stands<00:02:21.920> to<00:02:22.130> reason<00:02:22.160> that<00:02:22.520> there's<00:02:22.940> a<00:02:23.060> lot

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
it stands to reason that there's a lot

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.600 
it stands to reason that there's a lot

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
not going to fix him and you don't

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.260 
not going to fix him and you don't
notice<00:02:27.410> them<00:02:27.560> because<00:02:28.310> that's<00:02:28.550> just<00:02:28.790> the<00:02:29.000> the

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
notice them because that's just the the

crazy<00:02:32.420> and<00:02:32.720> it<00:02:32.840> just<00:02:33.290> works<00:02:33.970> unless<00:02:34.970> you're<00:02:35.210> to

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
crazy and it just works unless you're to

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.500 
crazy and it just works unless you're to
a<00:02:35.870> pipe<00:02:36.290> tube<00:02:36.560> you<00:02:37.460> know<00:02:37.550> handle<00:02:38.090> it<00:02:38.210> I<00:02:38.330> mean

now let's talk about the meat of any

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.420 
now let's talk about the meat of any
open<00:03:18.360> world<00:03:18.570> game<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.230> side<00:03:19.590> missions<00:03:19.890> there

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
open world game the side missions there

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.540 
open world game the side missions there
are<00:03:20.610> a<00:03:20.640> lot<00:03:21.060> but<00:03:21.600> not<00:03:22.440> as<00:03:22.680> many<00:03:22.950> as<00:03:23.190> I<00:03:23.340> would

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
are a lot but not as many as I would

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.730 
are a lot but not as many as I would
like<00:03:23.790> that's<00:03:24.750> probably<00:03:25.110> just<00:03:25.260> because<00:03:25.350> I<00:03:25.590> have

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:25.740 
like that's probably just because I have

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.530 
like that's probably just because I have
so<00:03:25.860> much<00:03:25.980> fun<00:03:26.190> playing<00:03:26.220> with<00:03:26.580> him<00:03:26.790> you<00:03:27.090> do<00:03:27.330> get

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
so much fun playing with him you do get

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.840 
so much fun playing with him you do get
a<00:03:27.570> decent<00:03:27.810> amount<00:03:28.110> as<00:03:28.950> for<00:03:29.250> what<00:03:29.400> some<00:03:29.670> of<00:03:29.700> the

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
a decent amount as for what some of the

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.990 
a decent amount as for what some of the
side<00:03:30.120> missions<00:03:30.330> actually<00:03:31.050> are<00:03:31.550> genki<00:03:32.550> returns

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
side missions actually are genki returns

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.560 
side missions actually are genki returns
with<00:03:33.810> a<00:03:33.840> mode<00:03:34.200> called<00:03:34.530> Jenkees<00:03:35.490> mom<00:03:35.850> which<00:03:36.390> is

mine over murder and you got to use your

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.360 
mine over murder and you got to use your
calcaneus<00:03:39.840> power<00:03:40.050> to<00:03:40.230> pick<00:03:40.710> people<00:03:40.890> up<00:03:41.160> and

calcaneus power to pick people up and

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.320 
calcaneus power to pick people up and
throw<00:03:42.090> them<00:03:42.120> these<00:03:42.540> these<00:03:42.960> holes<00:03:43.320> with<00:03:44.330> Pete

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
throw them these these holes with Pete

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:46.700 
throw them these these holes with Pete
silhouettes<00:03:45.840> of<00:03:45.930> people<00:03:46.260> in<00:03:46.380> them<00:03:46.470> and<00:03:46.590> then

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:46.710 
silhouettes of people in them and then

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.320 
silhouettes of people in them and then
they<00:03:46.800> just<00:03:46.980> blow<00:03:47.190> up<00:03:47.340> into<00:03:47.460> confetti<00:03:47.790> that

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
they just blow up into confetti that

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.120 
they just blow up into confetti that
gives<00:03:48.480> you<00:03:48.600> points<00:03:48.780> you<00:03:49.020> pick<00:03:49.380> up<00:03:49.500> cars<00:03:49.830> do<00:03:50.100> the

gives you points you pick up cars do the
same<00:03:50.490> thing<00:03:50.930> genki<00:03:51.930> heads<00:03:52.530> stuff<00:03:53.370> like<00:03:53.550> that

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
same thing genki heads stuff like that

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.720 
same thing genki heads stuff like that
and<00:03:53.730> then<00:03:53.910> you<00:03:54.030> got<00:03:54.150> another<00:03:54.620> mcmayhem<00:03:55.730> which

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
and then you got another mcmayhem which

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.590 
and then you got another mcmayhem which
is<00:03:57.030> just<00:03:57.780> the<00:03:57.900> same<00:03:58.140> as<00:03:58.470> tank<00:03:59.010> may<00:03:59.370> am<00:03:59.640> will<00:04:00.450> you
