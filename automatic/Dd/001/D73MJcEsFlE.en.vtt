00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
think about the generation after that we

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.570 
think about the generation after that we
believe<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.170> this<00:01:10.920> land<00:01:11.310> should<00:01:11.520> be

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
believe that this land should be

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.820 
believe that this land should be
permanently<00:01:12.270> preserved<00:01:12.840> for<00:01:13.409> urban

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830
