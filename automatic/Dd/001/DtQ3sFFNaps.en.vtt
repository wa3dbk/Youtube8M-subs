this<00:00:41.039> is<00:00:41.249> its<00:00:41.850> own<00:00:42.059> model<00:00:42.359> then<00:00:42.659> as<00:00:43.050> far<00:00:43.260> as<00:00:43.319> the

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:43.589 
this is its own model then as far as the

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:45.169 
this is its own model then as far as the
the<00:00:43.620> exhaust<00:00:44.159> goes<00:00:44.399> down<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.670> quad<00:00:44.879> tips

00:00:45.169 --> 00:00:45.179 
the exhaust goes down the quad tips

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:48.229 
the exhaust goes down the quad tips
exactly<00:00:45.749> so<00:00:46.350> this<00:00:46.530> is<00:00:46.739> new<00:00:47.010> brand-new<00:00:47.519> this<00:00:48.089> is

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
exactly so this is new brand-new this is

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.660 
exactly so this is new brand-new this is
basically<00:00:48.659> the<00:00:48.839> same<00:00:49.019> system<00:00:49.409> all<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.550> way

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
basically the same system all the way

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.180 
basically the same system all the way

right then we have the three inch over
the<00:01:03.359> axle<00:01:03.749> mandrel<00:01:04.080> bent<00:01:04.229> pipes<00:01:04.440> and<00:01:04.739> for<00:01:05.159> this

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
the axle mandrel bent pipes and for this

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.130 
the axle mandrel bent pipes and for this
particular<00:01:05.640> application<00:01:06.360> we<00:01:06.810> have<00:01:07.079> a

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
particular application we have a

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.050 
particular application we have a
polished<00:01:07.710> offset<00:01:08.579> muffler<00:01:09.030> that

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
polished offset muffler that

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.209 
polished offset muffler that
incorporates<00:01:09.869> those<00:01:10.049> quad<00:01:10.350> tips<00:01:10.619> so<00:01:10.860> where<00:01:11.100> it

00:01:11.209 --> 00:01:11.219 
incorporates those quad tips so where it

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:13.370 
incorporates those quad tips so where it
connects<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.759> the<00:01:11.939> over<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.450> axle<00:01:12.810> pipes<00:01:13.049> is

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
connects to the over the axle pipes is

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.679 
connects to the over the axle pipes is
now<00:01:13.860> different<00:01:14.100> okay<00:01:14.579> okay<00:01:15.000> so<00:01:15.270> because<00:01:15.539> they

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
now different okay okay so because they
