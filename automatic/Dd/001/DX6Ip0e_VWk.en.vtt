seen that caught fire I wanted to get a
good<00:00:58.000> camera<00:00:59.000> shot<00:00:59.540> of<00:00:59.839> what<00:01:00.470> the<00:01:00.650> new<00:01:01.010> one

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
good camera shot of what the new one

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:02.650 
good camera shot of what the new one
looks<00:01:01.399> like<00:01:01.670> they're<00:01:02.270> a<00:01:02.300> little<00:01:02.420> bit

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
looks like they're a little bit

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.389 
looks like they're a little bit
different<00:01:03.020> this<00:01:03.290> is<00:01:03.350> what<00:01:03.649> I<00:01:03.680> pulled<00:01:03.980> out<00:01:04.129> and

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
you can kind of see here right in the

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.900 
you can kind of see here right in the
center<00:01:06.320> of<00:01:06.590> the<00:01:06.649> shot<00:01:06.920> that's<00:01:07.430> the<00:01:07.640> volume

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:07.910 
center of the shot that's the volume

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.410 
center of the shot that's the volume
adjustment<00:01:08.630> knob<00:01:08.920> also<00:01:09.920> on<00:01:10.430> the<00:01:10.640> new<00:01:10.820> one<00:01:11.090> the

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
adjustment knob also on the new one the

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.760 
adjustment knob also on the new one the
one<00:01:11.570> that<00:01:11.690> I<00:01:11.720> got<00:01:12.020> had<00:01:12.259> a<00:01:12.289> bunch<00:01:12.470> of<00:01:12.590> yellow

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
one that I got had a bunch of yellow

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.139 
one that I got had a bunch of yellow
paint<00:01:13.070> on<00:01:13.190> the<00:01:13.250> speaker<00:01:13.580> I<00:01:13.610> think<00:01:13.880> it<00:01:13.970> came

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:14.149 
paint on the speaker I think it came

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:17.200 
paint on the speaker I think it came
from<00:01:14.210> the<00:01:14.539> 86<00:01:15.200> and<00:01:15.530> I<00:01:15.950> believe<00:01:16.280> the<00:01:16.460> 86<00:01:17.090> is

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
from the 86 and I believe the 86 is

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.639 
from the 86 and I believe the 86 is
using<00:01:17.539> a<00:01:17.630> little<00:01:17.869> bit<00:01:18.110> different<00:01:18.440> sound

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:18.649 
using a little bit different sound

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:20.800 
using a little bit different sound
system<00:01:19.009> now<00:01:19.160> like<00:01:19.729> I<00:01:19.850> said<00:01:19.910> they're<00:01:20.210> exactly

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
system now like I said they're exactly

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.400 
system now like I said they're exactly
the<00:01:20.930> same<00:01:21.050> size<00:01:21.759> the<00:01:22.759> board<00:01:23.330> looks<00:01:23.660> identical

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:24.410 
the same size the board looks identical

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:25.960 
the same size the board looks identical
except<00:01:24.710> for<00:01:24.740> that<00:01:24.920> volume<00:01:25.130> knob<00:01:25.520> and<00:01:25.550> a<00:01:25.789> couple

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:25.970 
except for that volume knob and a couple

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.060 
except for that volume knob and a couple
other<00:01:26.210> small<00:01:26.509> details<00:01:26.539> you<00:01:27.440> can<00:01:27.560> kind<00:01:27.800> of<00:01:27.890> see

all<00:01:37.849> screwed<00:01:38.149> up<00:01:38.270> so<00:01:38.599> I<00:01:38.810> got<00:01:39.229> to<00:01:39.349> solder<00:01:39.560> those

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
all screwed up so I got to solder those

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.529 
all screwed up so I got to solder those
back<00:01:39.979> together<00:01:40.160> once<00:01:41.000> again<00:01:41.240> what<00:01:41.420> do<00:01:41.479> you

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.550 
expect you know set the bar low you
might<00:01:43.880> not<00:01:44.090> be<00:01:44.270> let<00:01:44.479> down<00:01:44.509> this<00:01:45.110> is<00:01:45.289> a<00:01:45.319> pretty

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
might not be let down this is a pretty

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.600 
might not be let down this is a pretty
nice<00:01:45.740> plane<00:01:46.069> I<00:01:46.099> got<00:01:46.310> to<00:01:46.459> say<00:01:46.610> it<00:01:47.319> lands<00:01:48.319> very

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
nice plane I got to say it lands very

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.859 
nice plane I got to say it lands very
very<00:01:49.610> well<00:01:49.849> it<00:01:50.090> took<00:01:50.240> me<00:01:50.360> a<00:01:50.390> little<00:01:50.479> while<00:01:50.599> to

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
very well it took me a little while to

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.080 
very well it took me a little while to
figure<00:01:51.020> out<00:01:51.259> the<00:01:51.470> flap<00:01:51.740> and<00:01:51.979> elevator<00:01:52.459> mix<00:01:52.789> for

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
figure out the flap and elevator mix for

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.880 
figure out the flap and elevator mix for
the<00:01:53.179> right<00:01:53.360> approach<00:01:53.750> but<00:01:54.050> keep<00:01:54.560> a<00:01:54.649> little<00:01:54.770> bit

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
the right approach but keep a little bit

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:56.380 
the right approach but keep a little bit
of<00:01:55.009> power<00:01:55.280> on<00:01:55.520> and<00:01:55.729> man<00:01:55.849> this<00:01:55.970> thing<00:01:56.209> just

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
of power on and man this thing just

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.749 
of power on and man this thing just
greases<00:01:56.810> itself<00:01:57.200> in<00:01:57.440> it's<00:01:57.860> a<00:01:57.920> real<00:01:58.190> nice<00:01:58.429> plane

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 
greases itself in it's a real nice plane

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:01.210 
greases itself in it's a real nice plane
I've<00:01:58.910> been<00:01:59.060> real<00:01:59.300> happy<00:01:59.479> with<00:01:59.750> it<00:01:59.810> so<00:02:00.220> anyways

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
I've been real happy with it so anyways

I've been real happy with it so anyways
