00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.759
 windows version and it works 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.910
 wonder what we are going to do first 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.490
 is to install an android emulator in 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.590
 our pc are two steps first let's go 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.410
 to install an android emulator that 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.720
 call bluestacks app player and then 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.910
 we will be able to run the whatsapp in 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.320
 windows I have here the link you what 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.939

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.000
 interested in looking for some other program 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.829
 and we're going to go to the end of the 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.559
 input and we click on the cloud 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.350
 to start downloading immediately 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.940
 it weighs almost 10 megabytes that I'm going to stop 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.379
 here to not make you wait and I have it 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.230
 here on my desk and I'm going to run 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.879

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.149
 file that you download we give to 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.739
 continue next install but here 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.660
 we are going to disable these two options 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.790
 because I do not need them 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.089
 let's wait a few seconds to 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:06.370
 I have it ready so I have to 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.390
 I will accelerate and we're here this 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:12.790
 is the emulator the blue stack app player 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.380
 plays a lot of games so date 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.840

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.510

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.630

 to enable the google play we give to 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.300
 continue I already have an account if you 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.980
 you do not have a google play account 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:34.380
 you have to create it with a mail gmail 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.300
 so I'm going to write my name here 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.420

 disabled this next option here 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.600
 there's not much do not worry about those 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.870
 options there is no problem if the 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.780
 brands are now let's synchronize the 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:54.450
 device as if this were our 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.420
 cell phone so once again 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.220
 let's allow synchronization with 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.660
 google play I do not want to save my 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.710

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:06.390
 password and ready let's enter 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.820
 we waited a couple of seconds more for 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.680
 I fully loaded and I'm 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.490
 inside all the options are 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.100
 enabled 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:18.070
 as we have synchronized our 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.530
 emulator with google play we will be able to 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.630
 run any application that is 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.760
 find in google play as you 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.160
 mentioned there are many games later 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.460
 we're going to give you one more look but this 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.320
 once we come for the whatsapp so 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:35.470
 let's go to the top and we're going to 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.810
 look in the lupita what's up once 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.750
 more we carry out the search this time 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:44.050
 will allow us to download it because 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.360
 we have synchronized our emulated 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.700
 here is the whatsapp messenger we're going 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.770
 to give to install we will give all 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.040
 the permissions that the application asks us 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:57.700
 and we give him to accept is going to start 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:01.120
 download weighs just 14 megabytes a 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:03.460
 little less let's give it a little time and 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.010
 I will accelerate it as always to 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:09.430
 you do not have to wait, it 's almost there 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:12.250
 ready and let's see here and we should 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:15.250
 appear and ready installing and now yes 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.590
 we are going to give him to open to start the 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.940
 whatsapp messenger tells us that the 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.010
 first time it's free 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.260
 will ask us to pay 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.330
 a cell phone number so pick up 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.060
 any phone you have on hand 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.520
 I chose one that I was not using and 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:34.160
 write a cell phone number to make 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:36.440
 the whatsapp verification 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.180
 is always going to ask for this step so 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.340
 try to get any phone 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.860
 that you are not using there is no 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.320
 problem because if you use your phone 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:48.410
 then you'll ask when 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:51.140
 download, make a payment, tell me, failure 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.270
 verification by text message like this 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.340
 I'm going to verify with a call 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:57.500
 give to call me will dictate a code 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.630
 I'm going to write here a code of six 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.540
 digits will verify that the code 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:04.850
 be well and ready is working 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.430
 pretty good everything was fine with the 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:10.730
 code and now we will be able to start 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.980
 to send instant messages to 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:16.310
 our contacts we are going to put a 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:18.470
 username you type in 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.560
 any name there is no problem 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:24.920
 and now we are going to give it to finalize 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:27.260
 the next one we give ok 

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.150
 not the message appears again 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.740
 that this time it will be free and we give 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.020
 continue as was a number that does not 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.490
 I was using because I do not have any 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.520
 contact so I'm going to send you a 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:40.670
 message from another phone we will see that 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:44.420
 we can answer I'll write here a 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:46.040
 we will give message to send if if 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:48.200
 I get to my phone so there's no 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.420
 no problem I'm seeing it here I'm going 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:53.930
 to answer to verify that it is 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:56.030
 all working fine if another message 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.310
 more so there's no problem with 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.650
 the whatsapp is working all right 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.570
 I'm going to add the contact to have it 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.940
 stored in my whatsapp you can 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:07.400
 Do the same thing by adding the numbers 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:10.420
 of your friends one by one to be able 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.950
 Chat with them and send them messages 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:15.890
 instant 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:17.840
 this emulator has many many 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:20.900
 advantages and it's definitely the best 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:23.420
 Android emulator for pc that does not exist 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.890
 only emulate the interface but 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:27.530
 goes to the extreme of emulating the 

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:30.080
 Accelerometer equipment allows you 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:32.090
 the timing and has many other 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.570
 tools how to play the games 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:38.180

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:40.580
 google play to show you all 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:43.070
