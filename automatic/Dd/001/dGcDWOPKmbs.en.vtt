00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.500 

I<00:00:02.500> began<00:00:03.500> by<00:00:03.680> cutting<00:00:04.010> two<00:00:04.160> strips<00:00:04.490> of<00:00:04.610> MDF<00:00:05.090> one

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:05.510 
I began by cutting two strips of MDF one

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:07.000 
I began by cutting two strips of MDF one
equal<00:00:05.870> to<00:00:06.020> the<00:00:06.080> height<00:00:06.230> of<00:00:06.260> the<00:00:06.470> table<00:00:06.800> saw

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.010 
equal to the height of the table saw

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:08.560 
equal to the height of the table saw
fence<00:00:07.279> and<00:00:07.580> in<00:00:07.729> a<00:00:07.850> taller<00:00:08.120> one<00:00:08.269> that<00:00:08.480> we

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:08.570 
fence and in a taller one that we

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:11.170 
fence and in a taller one that we
laminated<00:00:09.230> to<00:00:09.410> it<00:00:09.590> the<00:00:10.430> small<00:00:10.700> piece<00:00:10.940> is<00:00:11.150> just

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:11.180 
laminated to it the small piece is just

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:12.700 
laminated to it the small piece is just
a<00:00:11.450> stop<00:00:11.720> block<00:00:11.870> to<00:00:12.020> make<00:00:12.290> sure<00:00:12.470> to<00:00:12.590> my

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:12.710 
a stop block to make sure to my

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.350 
a stop block to make sure to my
sacrificial<00:00:13.460> fence<00:00:13.610> is<00:00:13.850> positioned

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:14.360 
sacrificial fence is positioned

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.720 
sacrificial fence is positioned
correctly<00:00:14.480> every<00:00:15.050> time

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:15.730 
correctly every time

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.400 
correctly every time
now<00:00:16.730> comes<00:00:17.029> the<00:00:17.119> toughest<00:00:17.480> part<00:00:17.750> you<00:00:18.199> have<00:00:18.320> to

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 
now comes the toughest part you have to

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.769 
now comes the toughest part you have to
actually<00:00:18.830> drill<00:00:19.160> a<00:00:19.189> 3/8<00:00:19.699> inch<00:00:19.880> diameter<00:00:20.509> hole

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:20.779 
actually drill a 3/8 inch diameter hole

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:25.149 
actually drill a 3/8 inch diameter hole
Friedrichs<00:00:21.380> clams<00:00:21.769> you<00:00:23.529> also<00:00:24.529> have<00:00:24.800> to<00:00:24.949> check

00:00:25.149 --> 00:00:25.159 
Friedrichs clams you also have to check

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:26.409 
Friedrichs clams you also have to check
to<00:00:25.189> make<00:00:25.339> sure<00:00:25.460> that<00:00:25.669> you<00:00:25.909> drill<00:00:26.150> the<00:00:26.329> hole

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:26.419 
to make sure that you drill the hole

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:28.019 
to make sure that you drill the hole
deep<00:00:26.659> enough

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:28.029 
deep enough

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:30.489 
deep enough
next<00:00:29.029> they<00:00:29.150> glued<00:00:29.390> the<00:00:29.599> shorter<00:00:29.960> fence<00:00:30.230> piece

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:30.499 
next they glued the shorter fence piece

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:32.740 
next they glued the shorter fence piece
one<00:00:30.890> that<00:00:31.039> we<00:00:31.130> just<00:00:31.339> drilled<00:00:31.579> the<00:00:31.669> holes<00:00:31.880> in<00:00:32.210> to

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
one that we just drilled the holes in to

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.540 
one that we just drilled the holes in to
the<00:00:32.900> back<00:00:33.050> of<00:00:33.260> the<00:00:33.320> taller<00:00:33.560> piece<00:00:33.860> making<00:00:34.370> sure

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
the back of the taller piece making sure

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.990 
the back of the taller piece making sure
that<00:00:34.699> the<00:00:34.820> ends<00:00:35.120> and<00:00:35.239> bottoms<00:00:35.660> were<00:00:35.899> flush<00:00:36.230> I

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.000 
that the ends and bottoms were flush I

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.430 
that the ends and bottoms were flush I
added<00:00:38.000> a<00:00:38.059> few<00:00:38.090> staples<00:00:38.510> to<00:00:38.840> hold<00:00:38.870> the<00:00:39.079> pieces

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
added a few staples to hold the pieces

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.560 
added a few staples to hold the pieces
together<00:00:39.559> while<00:00:39.949> the<00:00:40.070> glue<00:00:40.100> dried<00:00:40.579> you<00:00:41.239> notice

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
together while the glue dried you notice

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:42.970 
together while the glue dried you notice
they<00:00:41.660> stayed<00:00:41.930> away<00:00:42.170> from<00:00:42.379> the<00:00:42.500> area<00:00:42.710> where<00:00:42.739> the

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
they stayed away from the area where the

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.060 
they stayed away from the area where the
blade<00:00:43.219> is<00:00:43.399> going<00:00:43.430> to<00:00:43.640> come<00:00:43.850> up<00:00:44.859> while<00:00:45.859> holding

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070 
blade is going to come up while holding

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.950 
blade is going to come up while holding
the<00:00:46.309> sacrificial<00:00:46.820> fence<00:00:47.179> against<00:00:47.690> the<00:00:47.780> table

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
the sacrificial fence against the table

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.410 
the sacrificial fence against the table
saw<00:00:48.260> hands<00:00:48.730> adjusted<00:00:49.730> it<00:00:49.879> so<00:00:49.910> that<00:00:50.269> the

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
saw hands adjusted it so that the

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.750 
saw hands adjusted it so that the
sacrificial<00:00:50.929> fence<00:00:51.320> just<00:00:51.829> about<00:00:52.160> covers<00:00:52.730> the

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
sacrificial fence just about covers the

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.119 
sacrificial fence just about covers the
opening<00:00:53.359> for<00:00:53.600> a<00:00:53.629> dataset<00:00:54.320> to<00:00:54.440> come<00:00:54.649> up<00:00:54.829> I

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
opening for a dataset to come up I

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:57.520 
opening for a dataset to come up I
wanted<00:00:56.120> just<00:00:56.420> at<00:00:56.570> the<00:00:56.690> edge<00:00:56.839> and<00:00:57.140> it's<00:00:57.289> zero

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
wanted just at the edge and it's zero

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.169 
wanted just at the edge and it's zero
