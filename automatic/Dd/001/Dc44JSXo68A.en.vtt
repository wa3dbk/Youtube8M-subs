hey<00:00:00.510> youtube<00:00:01.170> herbal<00:00:01.439> pepper<00:00:01.709> and<00:00:02.280> today<00:00:02.639> you

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
hey youtube herbal pepper and today you

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.769 
hey youtube herbal pepper and today you
are<00:00:03.449> looking<00:00:03.959> at<00:00:04.230> a<00:00:04.710> bunch<00:00:05.520> of<00:00:05.670> homemade<00:00:06.180> MREs

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
are looking at a bunch of homemade MREs

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.990 
are looking at a bunch of homemade MREs
now<00:00:07.350> the<00:00:07.710> reason<00:00:08.010> I'm<00:00:08.130> showing<00:00:08.280> you<00:00:08.490> this<00:00:08.580> it's

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
now the reason I'm showing you this it's

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.080 
now the reason I'm showing you this it's
because<00:00:09.500> if<00:00:10.500> you're<00:00:10.860> making<00:00:11.070> your<00:00:11.250> own<00:00:11.370> MREs

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
because if you're making your own MREs

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.370 
because if you're making your own MREs
and<00:00:12.450> you're<00:00:12.570> doing<00:00:12.690> it<00:00:12.840> with<00:00:12.900> a<00:00:13.019> bunch<00:00:13.230> of

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
and you're doing it with a bunch of

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.860 
and you're doing it with a bunch of
different<00:00:13.679> types<00:00:13.889> of<00:00:14.160> things<00:00:15.150> like<00:00:15.420> noodles

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
different types of things like noodles

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:22.010 
different types of things like noodles
rice<00:00:16.410> beans<00:00:18.859> soup<00:00:19.859> mixes<00:00:20.430> oats

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
rice beans soup mixes oats

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.029 
rice beans soup mixes oats
you're<00:00:22.320> going<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.859> have<00:00:23.070> difference<00:00:23.900> a

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 
you're going to have difference a

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.550 
you're going to have difference a
difference<00:00:26.039> in<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:26.670> material<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:28.140> how<00:00:28.529> it

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
difference in the material and how it

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.880 
difference in the material and how it
looks<00:00:28.859> in<00:00:29.099> other<00:00:29.279> words<00:00:29.490> so<00:00:30.529> for<00:00:31.529> those<00:00:31.619> of<00:00:31.679> you

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
looks in other words so for those of you

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.459 
looks in other words so for those of you
that<00:00:32.040> don't<00:00:32.160> know<00:00:32.840> the<00:00:33.840> air<00:00:33.989> that<00:00:34.110> we<00:00:34.230> breathe

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
that don't know the air that we breathe

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.170 
that don't know the air that we breathe
is<00:00:34.770> made<00:00:35.190> up<00:00:35.340> of<00:00:35.899> 80%<00:00:36.899> nitrogen<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.860> about<00:00:38.489> 20%

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
is made up of 80% nitrogen and about 20%

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.060 
is made up of 80% nitrogen and about 20%
oxygen<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:39.989> that<00:00:40.020> means<00:00:40.940> if<00:00:41.940> your<00:00:43.070> vacuum

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
oxygen so that means if your vacuum

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.979 
oxygen so that means if your vacuum
sealing<00:00:44.399> something<00:00:45.059> you're<00:00:45.390> removing<00:00:45.780> the

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
sealing something you're removing the

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.290 
sealing something you're removing the
oxygen<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:47.840> the<00:00:48.840> nitrogen<00:00:48.950> however<00:00:49.950> if<00:00:50.640> you

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
oxygen and the nitrogen however if you

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.990 
oxygen and the nitrogen however if you
are<00:00:51.449> using<00:00:51.660> an<00:00:51.899> o2<00:00:52.140> absorber<00:00:52.890> you're<00:00:53.670> only

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
are using an o2 absorber you're only

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.400 
are using an o2 absorber you're only
absorbing<00:00:54.629> the<00:00:55.850> oxygen<00:00:56.850> so<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.510> can<00:00:57.960> have

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
absorbing the oxygen so you can have

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.500 
absorbing the oxygen so you can have
some<00:00:58.910> that<00:00:59.910> looks<00:01:00.600> like<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:01.640> vacuum<00:01:02.640> sealed<00:01:03.239> as

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
some that looks like a vacuum sealed as

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.450 
some that looks like a vacuum sealed as
you<00:01:03.660> can<00:01:03.809> see<00:01:03.960> here<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.439> then<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:05.159> can<00:01:05.309> have

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
you can see here and then you can have

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.570 
you can see here and then you can have
some<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.810> looks<00:01:06.810> more<00:01:07.320> like<00:01:07.380> this<00:01:08.220> that's

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
some that looks more like this that's

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.210 
some that looks more like this that's
not<00:01:08.760> so<00:01:08.970> much<00:01:09.119> vacuum<00:01:09.510> sealed<00:01:09.810> now<00:01:10.350> it<00:01:10.740> really

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
not so much vacuum sealed now it really

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.480 
not so much vacuum sealed now it really
has<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.970> do<00:01:12.119> with<00:01:12.270> what's<00:01:12.720> in<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.290> now<00:01:13.770> this<00:01:14.220> is

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
has to do with what's in it now this is

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.149 
has to do with what's in it now this is
beans<00:01:14.760> beans<00:01:15.600> are<00:01:15.780> very<00:01:15.810> dense<00:01:16.200> so<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:16.799> would

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
beans beans are very dense so you would

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.730 
beans beans are very dense so you would
use<00:01:17.189> more<00:01:17.759> oxygen<00:01:17.810> absorbers<00:01:18.810> than<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.530> would

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
use more oxygen absorbers than you would

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.830 
use more oxygen absorbers than you would
for<00:01:20.040> something<00:01:20.790> that's<00:01:20.970> less<00:01:21.270> dense<00:01:21.890> and<00:01:22.890> so

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
for something that's less dense and so

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.980 
for something that's less dense and so
all<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:25.200> these<00:01:25.320> are<00:01:25.380> quart<00:01:26.040> sizes<00:01:26.430> which<00:01:26.610> I<00:01:26.759> use

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
all of these are quart sizes which I use

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.800 
all of these are quart sizes which I use
300c<00:01:27.990> co2<00:01:28.860> absorbers<00:01:29.520> but<00:01:30.270> this<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.570> great

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
300c co2 absorbers but this is great

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.969 
300c co2 absorbers but this is great
okay<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.770> if<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:32.700> could<00:01:32.880> fill<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:33.979> it's

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
okay and if you could fill this it's

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.420 
okay and if you could fill this it's
pretty<00:01:35.250> tight<00:01:35.610> which<00:01:36.509> means<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:37.140> there's

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
pretty tight which means that there's

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.980 
pretty tight which means that there's
not<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.490> lot<00:01:38.850> of<00:01:39.170> air<00:01:40.170> or<00:01:40.770> oxygen<00:01:41.759> or<00:01:42.479> anything

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
not a lot of air or oxygen or anything

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.160 
not a lot of air or oxygen or anything
in<00:01:43.140> there<00:01:43.320> but<00:01:43.890> as<00:01:44.070> you<00:01:44.100> can<00:01:44.399> see<00:01:44.579> it's<00:01:44.850> not

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
in there but as you can see it's not

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.550 
in there but as you can see it's not
vacuum<00:01:46.170> sealed<00:01:46.500> like<00:01:46.979> this<00:01:47.310> okay<00:01:48.290> another<00:01:49.290> one

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
vacuum sealed like this okay another one

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.630 
vacuum sealed like this okay another one
that's<00:01:50.369> similar<00:01:50.729> is<00:01:51.829> this<00:01:52.829> is<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.070> tortilla

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
that's similar is this is a tortilla

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.830 
that's similar is this is a tortilla
soup<00:01:54.119> mix<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.840> I<00:01:55.909> take<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:57.360> cut<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.719> off

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
soup mix and I take it and cut it off

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.120 
soup mix and I take it and cut it off
and<00:01:58.049> stick<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.500> back<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:58.890> then<00:01:58.979> I<00:01:59.070> do

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
and stick it to the back and then I do

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.319 
and stick it to the back and then I do
my<00:01:59.310> own<00:01:59.520> directions<00:01:59.790> on<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.149> front<00:02:00.469> it's<00:02:01.469> not

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329 
my own directions on the front it's not

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:04.730 
my own directions on the front it's not
see<00:02:03.329> you<00:02:03.540> can<00:02:03.689> see<00:02:03.960> right<00:02:04.110> here<00:02:04.170> where<00:02:04.560> it's

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
see you can see right here where it's

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.479 
see you can see right here where it's
not<00:02:04.860> very<00:02:05.100> tight<00:02:05.689> the<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:07.259> thing<00:02:08.009> with<00:02:08.220> that

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
not very tight the the thing with that

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.020 
not very tight the the thing with that
is<00:02:08.819> it<00:02:09.479> could<00:02:09.720> either<00:02:09.899> be<00:02:10.289> door<00:02:11.009> o<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.400> absorber

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
is it could either be door o to absorber

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.640 
is it could either be door o to absorber
was

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
was

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.170 
was
not<00:02:13.860> very<00:02:14.010> good<00:02:14.129> or<00:02:14.900> it<00:02:15.900> could<00:02:16.079> be<00:02:16.260> that<00:02:17.180> it's

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
not very good or it could be that it's

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.500 
not very good or it could be that it's
just<00:02:18.390> pulled<00:02:18.870> most<00:02:19.260> of<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:20.250> oxygen<00:02:21.030> out<00:02:21.209> if

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
just pulled most of the oxygen out if

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.660 
just pulled most of the oxygen out if
not<00:02:21.720> all<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:22.260> what's<00:02:22.890> left<00:02:23.099> behind<00:02:23.489> is

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
not all and what's left behind is

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.250 
not all and what's left behind is
nitrogen<00:02:24.060> and<00:02:24.360> nitrogen<00:02:24.420> won't<00:02:24.930> hurt<00:02:25.110> your

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
nitrogen and nitrogen won't hurt your

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.720 
nitrogen and nitrogen won't hurt your
food<00:02:25.470> food<00:02:25.920> okay<00:02:26.579> so<00:02:27.799> if<00:02:28.799> you<00:02:29.040> do<00:02:29.250> prefer<00:02:29.700> to

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
food food okay so if you do prefer to

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.119 
food food okay so if you do prefer to
have<00:02:30.150> a<00:02:30.420> more<00:02:30.450> vacuum-sealed<00:02:31.409> look<00:02:31.650> now

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
have a more vacuum-sealed look now

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:34.610 
have a more vacuum-sealed look now
because<00:02:32.430> this<00:02:32.700> is<00:02:32.939> small<00:02:33.390> it's<00:02:33.959> grit<00:02:34.260> so<00:02:34.500> it's

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
because this is small it's grit so it's

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.890 
because this is small it's grit so it's
very<00:02:34.799> small<00:02:35.340> and<00:02:35.640> so<00:02:35.909> you<00:02:36.000> won't<00:02:36.299> see<00:02:36.629> a

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
very small and so you won't see a

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.630 
very small and so you won't see a
defined<00:02:37.349> look<00:02:37.500> like<00:02:37.709> this<00:02:37.859> even<00:02:38.489> if<00:02:38.609> you

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
defined look like this even if you

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.300 
defined look like this even if you
vacuum<00:02:39.030> seal<00:02:39.239> it<00:02:39.510> it'll<00:02:39.810> just<00:02:39.859> get<00:02:40.859> real<00:02:41.040> hard

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
vacuum seal it it'll just get real hard

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.580 
vacuum seal it it'll just get real hard
but<00:02:42.180> for<00:02:42.329> the<00:02:42.390> most<00:02:42.540> part<00:02:42.780> this<00:02:42.989> is<00:02:43.260> sealed

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
but for the most part this is sealed

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.220 
but for the most part this is sealed
okay<00:02:44.120> this<00:02:45.120> one<00:02:45.299> I<00:02:45.329> have<00:02:45.569> a<00:02:45.599> few<00:02:46.019> concerns

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
okay this one I have a few concerns

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.080 
okay this one I have a few concerns
about<00:02:46.590> as<00:02:46.889> to<00:02:47.099> whether<00:02:47.280> it's<00:02:47.489> sealed<00:02:47.849> or<00:02:47.970> not

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
about as to whether it's sealed or not

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.149 
about as to whether it's sealed or not
like<00:02:48.359> I<00:02:48.389> said<00:02:48.659> it<00:02:48.780> could<00:02:48.989> be<00:02:49.260> that<00:02:49.829> all<00:02:50.129> the

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:50.159 
like I said it could be that all the

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:54.379 
like I said it could be that all the
oxygen<00:02:50.790> is<00:02:51.030> gone<00:02:51.659> and<00:02:51.989> there's<00:02:52.709> only<00:02:53.389> nitrogen

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:54.389 
oxygen is gone and there's only nitrogen

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:57.080 
oxygen is gone and there's only nitrogen
leftover<00:02:54.900> or<00:02:55.440> it<00:02:55.889> could<00:02:56.129> be<00:02:56.430> it<00:02:56.909> was

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
leftover or it could be it was

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.229 
leftover or it could be it was
completely<00:02:57.930> messed<00:02:58.170> up<00:02:58.349> default<00:02:58.950> I<00:02:59.670> need<00:03:00.060> to

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
completely messed up default I need to

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.960 
completely messed up default I need to
cut<00:03:00.689> it<00:03:00.780> back<00:03:00.900> open<00:03:01.109> and<00:03:01.470> start<00:03:01.709> over<00:03:01.859> and<00:03:02.129> the

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
cut it back open and start over and the

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.259 
cut it back open and start over and the
the<00:03:03.150> problem<00:03:03.299> here<00:03:03.840> is<00:03:04.079> once<00:03:04.439> you've<00:03:04.709> cut<00:03:05.489> once

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
the problem here is once you've cut once

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:07.910 
the problem here is once you've cut once
you've<00:03:06.420> sealed<00:03:06.629> it<00:03:06.810> up<00:03:06.900> and<00:03:07.139> cut<00:03:07.290> it<00:03:07.379> back<00:03:07.470> open

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
you've sealed it up and cut it back open

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.339 
you've sealed it up and cut it back open
then<00:03:08.430> you<00:03:08.459> have<00:03:08.760> to<00:03:08.909> kind<00:03:09.120> of<00:03:09.209> make<00:03:10.109> the<00:03:10.230> bag

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
then you have to kind of make the bag

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:11.629 
then you have to kind of make the bag
smaller<00:03:10.709> in<00:03:10.889> other<00:03:11.040> words<00:03:11.250> because<00:03:11.519> then

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:11.639 
smaller in other words because then

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:13.220 
smaller in other words because then
you're<00:03:11.760> going<00:03:11.849> to<00:03:11.909> cut<00:03:12.180> off<00:03:12.329> what<00:03:12.569> you've<00:03:12.780> used

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
you're going to cut off what you've used

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.259 
you're going to cut off what you've used
and<00:03:13.530> then<00:03:14.099> you'll<00:03:14.280> seal<00:03:14.579> it<00:03:14.730> down<00:03:14.849> here

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
and then you'll seal it down here

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.300 
and then you'll seal it down here
because<00:03:15.510> cix<00:03:16.079> identity<00:03:16.500> seal<00:03:16.739> this<00:03:16.889> all<00:03:17.129> the

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
because cix identity seal this all the

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.849 
because cix identity seal this all the
way<00:03:17.430> rather<00:03:17.669> than<00:03:17.790> sealing<00:03:18.750> it<00:03:18.870> right<00:03:19.079> with<00:03:19.680> my

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
way rather than sealing it right with my

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:21.589 
way rather than sealing it right with my
little<00:03:20.040> notches<00:03:20.340> are<00:03:20.730> and<00:03:20.879> below<00:03:21.180> here<00:03:21.449> would

00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 
little notches are and below here would

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.059 
little notches are and below here would
not<00:03:21.690> be<00:03:21.750> sealed<00:03:22.139> so<00:03:22.290> I<00:03:22.379> could<00:03:22.530> just<00:03:22.680> tear<00:03:22.949> it

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
not be sealed so I could just tear it

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:24.939 
not be sealed so I could just tear it
and<00:03:23.220> then<00:03:23.310> still<00:03:23.790> have<00:03:23.819> a<00:03:23.940> ziplock

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:24.949 
and then still have a ziplock

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:26.960 
and then still have a ziplock
unfortunately<00:03:25.949> if<00:03:26.099> I<00:03:26.220> have<00:03:26.370> to<00:03:26.489> redo<00:03:26.760> that<00:03:26.790> one

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
unfortunately if I have to redo that one

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.659 
unfortunately if I have to redo that one
I<00:03:27.269> won't<00:03:28.019> but<00:03:28.769> as<00:03:28.889> you<00:03:29.010> can<00:03:29.129> see<00:03:29.190> all<00:03:29.489> these

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:29.669 
I won't but as you can see all these

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:33.439 
I won't but as you can see all these
other<00:03:29.909> these<00:03:30.659> are<00:03:30.720> beans<00:03:31.109> and<00:03:31.650> rice<00:03:32.280> and<00:03:32.449> this

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:33.449 
other these are beans and rice and this

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:35.360 
other these are beans and rice and this
is<00:03:33.599> black<00:03:33.930> pepper<00:03:34.139> and<00:03:34.440> I<00:03:34.470> usually<00:03:34.650> don't<00:03:34.919> use

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
is black pepper and I usually don't use

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.379 
is black pepper and I usually don't use
a<00:03:35.669> lot<00:03:35.699> of<00:03:36.709> for<00:03:37.709> spices<00:03:38.220> and<00:03:38.400> stuff<00:03:38.489> and<00:03:39.000> o2

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:39.389 
a lot of for spices and stuff and o2

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:42.140 
a lot of for spices and stuff and o2
absorber<00:03:39.989> but<00:03:40.169> I<00:03:40.199> did<00:03:40.440> for<00:03:40.620> that<00:03:40.879> now<00:03:41.879> as<00:03:42.030> we

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
absorber but I did for that now as we

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.899 
absorber but I did for that now as we
move<00:03:42.359> on<00:03:42.510> down<00:03:42.540> you<00:03:43.500> will<00:03:43.650> see<00:03:43.680> lentils<00:03:44.669> right

00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:44.909 
move on down you will see lentils right

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:51.920 
move on down you will see lentils right
here<00:03:45.919> lentils<00:03:46.919> are<00:03:48.319> like<00:03:49.340> split<00:03:50.340> peas<00:03:50.750> this<00:03:51.750> is

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
here lentils are like split peas this is

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.770 
here lentils are like split peas this is
a<00:03:51.959> lentil<00:03:52.319> split<00:03:52.590> pea<00:03:52.709> mix<00:03:52.979> this<00:03:53.790> is<00:03:54.030> enough<00:03:54.569> to

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
a lentil split pea mix this is enough to

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.210 
a lentil split pea mix this is enough to
last<00:03:54.989> a<00:03:55.379> good<00:03:56.129> while<00:03:56.340> and<00:03:57.470> then<00:03:58.470> as<00:03:58.709> we<00:03:58.889> move<00:03:58.919> on

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
last a good while and then as we move on

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.890 
last a good while and then as we move on
down<00:03:59.250> you<00:03:59.639> will<00:03:59.760> see<00:03:59.790> this<00:04:00.060> is<00:04:00.239> chicken<00:04:00.479> noodle

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
down you will see this is chicken noodle

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.259 
down you will see this is chicken noodle
soup<00:04:01.139> as<00:04:01.379> you<00:04:01.799> can<00:04:01.979> see<00:04:02.190> it's<00:04:02.400> not<00:04:02.609> very<00:04:02.879> tight

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
soup as you can see it's not very tight

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.750 
soup as you can see it's not very tight
which<00:04:04.079> like<00:04:04.290> I<00:04:04.409> said<00:04:04.620> it<00:04:04.709> is<00:04:04.799> concerning<00:04:05.280> could

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
which like I said it is concerning could

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.770 
which like I said it is concerning could
be<00:04:05.940> a<00:04:06.180> default<00:04:06.900> messed<00:04:07.560> up<00:04:08.359> faulty<00:04:09.359> o2

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
be a default messed up faulty o2

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.199 
be a default messed up faulty o2
absorber<00:04:10.709> or<00:04:10.739> feed<00:04:11.310> that<00:04:11.459> it<00:04:11.579> really<00:04:11.790> just<00:04:11.879> did

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:12.209 
absorber or feed that it really just did

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.360 
absorber or feed that it really just did
its<00:04:12.359> job<00:04:12.419> and<00:04:12.840> it<00:04:13.409> just<00:04:13.620> doesn't<00:04:13.919> always<00:04:14.010> look

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
its job and it just doesn't always look

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.849 
its job and it just doesn't always look
out<00:04:14.579> turned<00:04:15.329> out<00:04:15.479> looking<00:04:15.629> like<00:04:15.810> that<00:04:16.079> same

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
out turned out looking like that same

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.860 
out turned out looking like that same
thing<00:04:16.889> with<00:04:17.159> my<00:04:17.310> oats<00:04:17.519> here<00:04:17.820> now<00:04:18.329> I<00:04:18.359> am

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
thing with my oats here now I am

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.240 
thing with my oats here now I am
definitely<00:04:19.079> worried<00:04:19.530> about<00:04:19.680> this<00:04:19.919> when<00:04:20.099> this

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
definitely worried about this when this

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.879 
definitely worried about this when this
is<00:04:20.400> mashed<00:04:20.699> potatoes<00:04:21.180> and<00:04:22.049> this<00:04:22.200> is<00:04:22.380> a<00:04:22.409> gallon

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
is mashed potatoes and this is a gallon

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:24.940 
is mashed potatoes and this is a gallon
size<00:04:23.070> bag<00:04:23.130> here<00:04:23.669> so

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
size bag here so

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:27.200 
size bag here so
but<00:04:25.950> anyways<00:04:26.250> I<00:04:26.280> am<00:04:26.550> worried<00:04:26.790> about<00:04:26.850> this

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
but anyways I am worried about this

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.730 
but anyways I am worried about this
because<00:04:27.660> I<00:04:28.440> have<00:04:28.470> compared<00:04:29.280> this<00:04:30.150> oats<00:04:30.740> to

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
because I have compared this oats to

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:32.360 
because I have compared this oats to
this<00:04:31.950> one

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
this one

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.990 
this one
this<00:04:33.120> is<00:04:33.360> oats<00:04:33.690> as<00:04:33.900> well<00:04:34.080> and<00:04:34.610> see<00:04:35.610> how<00:04:35.790> this

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
this is oats as well and see how this

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.210 
this is oats as well and see how this
one<00:04:36.210> is<00:04:36.240> sealed<00:04:36.570> and<00:04:36.810> this<00:04:37.290> one<00:04:37.440> is<00:04:37.560> not<00:04:37.740> so

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
one is sealed and this one is not so

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.670 
one is sealed and this one is not so
this<00:04:38.580> is<00:04:38.760> probably<00:04:39.240> has<00:04:39.510> to<00:04:39.750> do<00:04:39.870> with<00:04:40.200> the

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
this is probably has to do with the

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.850 
this is probably has to do with the
messed<00:04:41.370> up<00:04:41.520> oxygen<00:04:42.150> absorber<00:04:42.630> so<00:04:43.200> I<00:04:43.560> will

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
messed up oxygen absorber so I will

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.880 
messed up oxygen absorber so I will
probably<00:04:44.040> cut<00:04:44.490> this<00:04:44.640> back<00:04:44.850> open<00:04:45.270> and<00:04:45.740> seal<00:04:46.740> it

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:46.890 
probably cut this back open and seal it

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:48.800 
probably cut this back open and seal it
again<00:04:47.130> down<00:04:47.310> here<00:04:47.370> so<00:04:47.850> guys<00:04:48.120> I<00:04:48.300> just<00:04:48.480> wanted<00:04:48.690> to

I've got to reseal it with another
oxygen<00:05:23.490> absorber<00:05:24.210> I<00:05:24.390> don't<00:05:25.230> have<00:05:25.380> that<00:05:25.530> many

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
oxygen absorber I don't have that many

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:27.920 
oxygen absorber I don't have that many
oxygen<00:05:26.130> absorbers<00:05:26.580> what<00:05:27.120> you're<00:05:27.300> doing<00:05:27.750> is

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
oxygen absorbers what you're doing is

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:29.690 
oxygen absorbers what you're doing is
your<00:05:28.110> jump<00:05:28.380> and<00:05:28.530> oxygen<00:05:28.950> absorbers<00:05:29.400> are<00:05:29.520> very

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:29.700 
your jump and oxygen absorbers are very

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:32.720 
your jump and oxygen absorbers are very
cheap<00:05:30.030> you're<00:05:30.540> jumping<00:05:30.870> over<00:05:31.050> a<00:05:31.500> dollar<00:05:32.220> what

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:32.730 
cheap you're jumping over a dollar what

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:34.430 
cheap you're jumping over a dollar what
do<00:05:32.790> I<00:05:32.850> mean<00:05:33.060> by<00:05:33.090> a<00:05:33.210> dollar<00:05:33.510> this<00:05:33.870> right<00:05:34.110> here

cost much much more than what that few

00:05:42.479 --> 00:05:44.659 
cost much much more than what that few
little<00:05:42.900> oxygen<00:05:43.560> absorbers<00:05:44.220> that<00:05:44.370> I'm<00:05:44.460> going

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:44.669 
little oxygen absorbers that I'm going

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:46.070 
little oxygen absorbers that I'm going
to<00:05:44.729> be<00:05:44.880> using<00:05:45.090> so<00:05:45.360> you're<00:05:45.510> jumping<00:05:45.810> over<00:05:45.900> a

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 
to be using so you're jumping over a

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:55.280 
to be using so you're jumping over a
dollar<00:05:47.930> to<00:05:48.930> save<00:05:49.200> a<00:05:49.229> couple<00:05:49.590> pennies<00:05:49.919> on<00:05:54.290> on

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:55.290 
dollar to save a couple pennies on on

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:58.460 
dollar to save a couple pennies on on
some<00:05:55.680> oxygen<00:05:56.130> absorbers<00:05:56.610> okay<00:05:56.880> so<00:05:57.479> keep<00:05:58.290> that

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:58.470 
some oxygen absorbers okay so keep that

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.620 
some oxygen absorbers okay so keep that
in<00:05:58.620> mind<00:05:58.890> I<00:05:59.160> also<00:05:59.520> keep<00:05:59.850> in<00:06:00.030> mind<00:06:00.060> when<00:06:00.360> you<00:06:00.479> do

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.630 
in mind I also keep in mind when you do

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:02.480 
in mind I also keep in mind when you do
bust<00:06:00.900> them<00:06:01.080> open<00:06:01.500> that<00:06:01.890> they<00:06:02.010> do<00:06:02.070> absorb

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
bust them open that they do absorb

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.730 
bust them open that they do absorb
oxygen<00:06:02.790> and<00:06:03.300> there's<00:06:03.810> really<00:06:04.020> no<00:06:04.200> cutoff<00:06:04.560> you

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740 
oxygen and there's really no cutoff you

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.680 
oxygen and there's really no cutoff you
can't<00:06:04.979> stop<00:06:05.220> that<00:06:05.430> so<00:06:06.000> make<00:06:06.180> sure<00:06:06.210> when<00:06:06.570> you

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:06.690 
can't stop that so make sure when you

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:08.570 
can't stop that so make sure when you
cut<00:06:06.870> them<00:06:07.020> open<00:06:07.169> and<00:06:07.620> you<00:06:08.220> put<00:06:08.370> them<00:06:08.430> in<00:06:08.550> a

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:08.580 
cut them open and you put them in a

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.610 
cut them open and you put them in a
mason<00:06:08.820> jar<00:06:08.970> you<00:06:09.360> use<00:06:09.600> them<00:06:09.870> very<00:06:10.410> quickly

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620 
mason jar you use them very quickly

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:15.170 
mason jar you use them very quickly
after<00:06:11.340> okay<00:06:11.610> you<00:06:11.669> don't<00:06:12.000> want<00:06:12.300> to<00:06:13.790> have<00:06:14.790> them

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:15.180 
after okay you don't want to have them
