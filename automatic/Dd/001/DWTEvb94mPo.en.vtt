00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
well you know I'm just as good at math

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:41.410 
well you know I'm just as good at math
as<00:00:33.809> Joey<00:00:34.410> is<00:00:34.710> right<00:00:35.070> yes<00:00:35.550> of<00:00:35.820> course<00:00:37.760> yes<00:00:38.760> yeah

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
show you using counters yes I do okay

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.069 
show you using counters yes I do okay
why<00:00:59.969> don't<00:01:00.030> we<00:01:00.210> do<00:01:00.420> it<00:01:00.539> together

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
why don't we do it together

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.600 
why don't we do it together
hey<00:01:02.000> now<00:01:03.000> I'm<00:01:03.390> going<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.320> use<00:01:04.350> yellow<00:01:04.949> counters

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
hey now I'm going to use yellow counters

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.330 
hey now I'm going to use yellow counters
to<00:01:06.030> represent<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:07.200> number<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.590> gold<00:01:07.979> stars

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
to represent the number of gold stars

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.649 
to represent the number of gold stars
you<00:01:08.880> have<00:01:09.180> little<00:01:09.750> kitty<00:01:10.170> and<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:11.729> will<00:01:11.939> use<00:01:12.180> red

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
you have little kitty and I will use red

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.140 
you have little kitty and I will use red
counters<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.470> represent<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.220> number<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.640> gold

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
counters to represent the number of gold

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.859 
counters to represent the number of gold
stars

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
stars

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.070 
stars
Joey<00:01:16.530> has<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.369> reason<00:01:17.580> why<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.450> might<00:01:18.720> think

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
Joey has the reason why you might think

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.380 
Joey has the reason why you might think
that<00:01:19.170> Joey<00:01:19.590> has<00:01:19.920> most<00:01:20.250> more<00:01:20.640> stars<00:01:20.970> than<00:01:21.030> you

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
that Joey has most more stars than you

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.480 
that Joey has most more stars than you
is<00:01:21.570> because<00:01:22.380> you're<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.650> little<00:01:23.040> bit<00:01:23.220> more

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
is because you're a little bit more

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.810 
is because you're a little bit more
organized<00:01:24.119> any<00:01:24.930> ideas<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.740> what<00:01:26.009> we<00:01:26.430> might<00:01:26.640> be

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
organized any ideas of what we might be

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.940 
organized any ideas of what we might be
able<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.240> do<00:01:27.479> so<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:27.900> we<00:01:28.080> can<00:01:28.290> see<00:01:28.530> how<00:01:28.710> many

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
able to do so that we can see how many

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.920 
able to do so that we can see how many
stars<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.400> have<00:01:29.850> in<00:01:30.060> how<00:01:30.150> many<00:01:30.360> stars<00:01:30.630> Joey

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
stars you have in how many stars Joey

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:37.100 
stars you have in how many stars Joey
has<00:01:31.200> let<00:01:31.950> me<00:01:32.070> look<00:01:32.220> uh<00:01:34.310> well<00:01:35.310> I<00:01:35.640> like<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.689> put<00:01:36.900> my

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
has let me look uh well I like to put my

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.249 
has let me look uh well I like to put my
stars<00:01:37.500> in<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.829> row<00:01:37.860> just<00:01:38.700> like<00:01:38.939> my<00:01:39.210> yo<00:01:39.540> counters

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
stars in a row just like my yo counters

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.090 
stars in a row just like my yo counters
are<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.979> think<00:01:41.970> maybe<00:01:42.210> if<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:42.600> if<00:01:42.810> we<00:01:42.869> put<00:01:43.530> Joey's

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
are I think maybe if I if we put Joey's

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.139 
are I think maybe if I if we put Joey's
red<00:01:44.820> counters<00:01:45.509> in<00:01:45.810> in<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.560> row<00:01:46.829> that<00:01:47.579> might<00:01:47.820> help

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
red counters in in a row that might help

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.370 
red counters in in a row that might help
me<00:01:48.390> I<00:01:48.600> agree<00:01:49.140> with<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.619> so<00:01:50.280> why<00:01:50.520> don't<00:01:50.549> we<00:01:50.790> use

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
me I agree with you so why don't we use

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.539 
me I agree with you so why don't we use
frames<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:53.310> organize<00:01:54.149> our<00:01:54.770> counters<00:01:55.770> that's

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
frames to organize our counters that's

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.429 
frames to organize our counters that's
even<00:01:57.060> better

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
even better

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.289 
even better
all<00:01:58.740> right<00:01:59.009> so<00:01:59.189> let's<00:01:59.430> go<00:01:59.610> ahead<00:01:59.729> and<00:01:59.909> start

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299

all right so let's go ahead and start
with<00:02:00.630> your<00:02:00.930> counters<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.619> yellow<00:02:01.890> ones<00:02:02.219> and

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
with your counters the yellow ones and

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.810 
with your counters the yellow ones and
you<00:02:02.909> can<00:02:02.939> help<00:02:03.270> me<00:02:03.390> count<00:02:03.719> oh<00:02:04.020> good<00:02:04.729> okay<00:02:05.729> I'm

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
you can help me count oh good okay I'm

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:13.640 
you can help me count oh good okay I'm
ready<00:02:06.060> when<00:02:06.329> you<00:02:06.360> are<00:02:06.540> one<00:02:08.420> two<00:02:10.700> three

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
ready when you are one two three

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:20.179 
ready when you are one two three
whar<00:02:14.870> five<00:02:16.220> great<00:02:17.220> I<00:02:17.519> have<00:02:18.000> five<00:02:18.420> guys<00:02:19.409> that's

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:20.189 
whar five great I have five guys that's

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:22.460 
whar five great I have five guys that's
correct<00:02:20.670> so<00:02:21.239> let's<00:02:21.269> go<00:02:21.750> ahead<00:02:21.989> and<00:02:22.170> do<00:02:22.319> the

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
correct so let's go ahead and do the

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.190 
correct so let's go ahead and do the
same<00:02:22.739> thing<00:02:23.040> for<00:02:23.310> Joy's<00:02:23.670> red<00:02:24.060> counters<00:02:24.599> okay

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
same thing for Joy's red counters okay

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:36.140 
same thing for Joy's red counters okay
one<00:02:26.599> two<00:02:28.340> three<00:02:31.340> four<00:02:34.040> five<00:02:35.040> so<00:02:35.849> how<00:02:36.090> many

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
one two three four five so how many

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.000 
one two three four five so how many
stars<00:02:36.750> does<00:02:37.079> Joey<00:02:37.349> have<00:02:37.939> Joey<00:02:38.939> has<00:02:39.629> five<00:02:40.260> stars

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
stars does Joey have Joey has five stars

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.869 
stars does Joey have Joey has five stars
-<00:02:41.790> yes<00:02:42.720> so<00:02:43.290> it<00:02:43.409> helps<00:02:43.769> to<00:02:43.829> organize<00:02:44.159> our

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
- yes so it helps to organize our

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:48.140 
- yes so it helps to organize our
counters<00:02:45.829> so<00:02:46.829> now<00:02:47.010> why<00:02:47.250> don't<00:02:47.310> we<00:02:47.519> use<00:02:47.790> lines

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
counters so now why don't we use lines

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.270 
counters so now why don't we use lines
to<00:02:48.510> match<00:02:48.720> up<00:02:49.019> the<00:02:49.200> counters<00:02:49.680> in<00:02:49.709> the<00:02:49.859> first

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
to match up the counters in the first

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.430 
to match up the counters in the first
