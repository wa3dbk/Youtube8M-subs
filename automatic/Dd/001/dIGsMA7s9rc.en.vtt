little bit full of myself to say I hope
not<00:01:19.439> but<00:01:20.220> I<00:01:20.280> think<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:20.729> we<00:01:20.820> both<00:01:20.970> influenced

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
not but I think that we both influenced

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.010

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
noticed that my printer was not very

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:23.760 
noticed that my printer was not very
good<00:03:22.360> at<00:03:22.570> printing<00:03:22.900> screentones

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:23.770 
good at printing screentones

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.040 
good at printing screentones
which<00:03:24.430> I<00:03:24.580> use<00:03:24.760> for<00:03:24.790> the<00:03:25.120> illustrations<00:03:25.780> but

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
which I use for the illustrations but

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:27.120 
which I use for the illustrations but
that's<00:03:26.230> not<00:03:26.410> something<00:03:26.709> I'm<00:03:26.800> gonna<00:03:26.950> be<00:03:27.070> able

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
that's not something I'm gonna be able

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.620 
that's not something I'm gonna be able
to<00:03:27.310> fix<00:03:27.610> and<00:03:27.880> I<00:03:27.910> think<00:03:28.120> it<00:03:28.180> actually<00:03:28.480> looks

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
to fix and I think it actually looks

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.890 
to fix and I think it actually looks
okay<00:03:29.140> I<00:03:29.170> just<00:03:29.290> wouldn't<00:03:29.680> use<00:03:29.860> it<00:03:29.890> for<00:03:30.190> like<00:03:30.340> a

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
okay I just wouldn't use it for like a

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.480 
okay I just wouldn't use it for like a
whole<00:03:31.900> book<00:03:32.260> of<00:03:32.500> manga<00:03:32.920> I<00:03:32.980> would<00:03:33.130> definitely

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:33.490 
whole book of manga I would definitely

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:36.000 
whole book of manga I would definitely
go<00:03:33.610> with<00:03:33.760> another<00:03:34.060> publisher<00:03:34.840> for<00:03:35.350> this<00:03:35.590> and<00:03:35.950> I

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
go with another publisher for this and I

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.580 
go with another publisher for this and I
used<00:03:36.280> create<00:03:36.700> space

actually really glad that I took my time
with<00:04:47.900> this<00:04:48.169> because<00:04:48.289> it<00:04:48.500> came<00:04:48.590> out<00:04:48.710> really

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:48.889 
with this because it came out really

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:51.190 
with this because it came out really
really<00:04:48.979> nice<00:04:49.370> and<00:04:50.240> it<00:04:50.510> has<00:04:50.630> a<00:04:50.660> nice<00:04:50.870> matte

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
really nice and it has a nice matte

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.010 
really nice and it has a nice matte
cover<00:04:52.030> instead<00:04:53.030> of<00:04:53.150> a<00:04:53.240> gloss<00:04:53.510> one<00:04:53.870> I<00:04:53.900> just

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
cover instead of a gloss one I just

00:04:54.020 --> 00:05:00.610 
cover instead of a gloss one I just
think<00:04:54.410> it<00:04:54.530> looks<00:04:54.710> more<00:04:54.919> professional<00:04:59.410> if<00:05:00.410> you

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
think it looks more professional if you
