 indianapolis motor speedway to follow 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.630

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.930

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.760
 so you'll know when you reach the best 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.609
 kaka performance 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:32.820
 the narration beauty is cool is very cool 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:35.010
 the area out there understood not not something 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.540
 relevant to narration a game of 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.420
 you are a fan of 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.530
 motor racing knows what I'm talking about 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:44.520
 understood why this is so because 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.680
 next we are not you who is 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.510
 watching that you are a motoring fan 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.340
 like me 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.579
 we get the creeps of hearing the 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:57.899
 engine noise lost the voice of galvÃ£o 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:00.629
 bueno and true is the following minimum 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:03.989
 it was even a good storytelling because 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.640
 nor cockpit camera well I do not know that the 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.480
 you asked for if you had not 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:12.120
 voiceover narration did not play the game 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:16.290
 It's good, let 's play it was not the 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:20.550
 gameplay is the following the game is here 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:23.670
 A good game here was oral or also a 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.740
 I play here I 'm not taking the 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.080
 thing flag like i'm not flag 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.840
 of human grid on big flag 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:35.340
 tourism understood is the following the game is 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.200
 here I thought I believed but friend in a 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.590
 arcade game you have to use the 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:44.850
 brakes so that you can make a curve and 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:47.610
 It's impossible for you to brake to make a curve. 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.430
 and a guy who came influenza thanou the bug 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.140
 whole leave stronger than you leave 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.740
 faster than you 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.390
 and lose less speed of you that the 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.300
 state grid giving a ball show 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.860
 You 're a guy who's drifting 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.610
 will bust here because the question of 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:09.570
 souza freire cv and using brake to make 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:12.300
 the curve and the car left a smoke capita 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:16.020
 is so much smoke that you know neither where 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:20.820
 is more on track both as follows 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:22.680
 the gameplay is similar 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.690
 with grid 1 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.610
 by the way it's a game for the day that 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.390
 What is the game set up? 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:33.870
 he's skidding a lot more from grid 1 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:36.930
 much more smoke grid one he's kind 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:40.370
 when you finish making the curve and 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:43.110
 will come back with the stroke and ltda and type 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.700
 I do not know how to avoid a 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.810
 face that is heading for a yaw 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:51.660
 nobody on the steering wheel understood that's what I 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.490
 to finding weird is 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.370
 gameplay as our friend of 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:03:00.270
 Money said "No, it's not." 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:04.920
 looks not 95% 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:09.330
 the utah grid if you are 45 is very good 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:12.239
 because it's just to play the game you'll see 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.519
 I put the grid together and run a race 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.620
 then I put grid 2 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.470
 you will see that there're a lot like 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.440
 I'm not there, it's no use whatsoever. 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:25.470
 of the grid 2 when you pull the brake 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.459
 hand your car 150 per hour goes to 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.760
 30 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:32.940
 and in here you're not going to run away you 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.930
 for 98 understood justice for the love of 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.140
 God 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:40.410
 then you talk like fields but the narration 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:44.850
 It's great the storytelling of the game is incredible. 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:47.040
 So our plot has nothing to talk about. 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.780
 game history is wonderful there you 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.120
 say so no beauty so let's play 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.010
 the campaign mode 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:56.160
 one of the first clues of the 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.200
 expensive campaign already teaches you to be a 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.940
 Sucker first because it looks the 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.940
 man what the narrator is going to tell you 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.410
 I will fight tomorrow and it is not easy to straight 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.400
 fast and mix with more stretches 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.140
 technical 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.560
 be careful never to lose 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:17.330
 concentration watch the card take care 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.980
 If it is going to pass this guy it will close the 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:22.760
 door without 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:25.130
 That's beauty, take care with the crankcase. 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.950
 When you go, he goes. 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.420
 close the door there beauty is you whirl 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.380
 a guy who threw the campaign 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.910
 multiplayer 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.800
 Then you can impose a friend, I'm 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:36.530
 passing you that you closed the 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.150
 need a game equal to the caic 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:42.050
 being played campaign 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:44.890
 Look there he closes the door friend too. 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.890
 for the love of God 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.910
 For God's sake, father. It's not for 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.730
 cry a business like that had not 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:55.310
 narration a guy who does not send English 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:58.640
 I would not even know he was going to think 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:00.500
 you close the door is to understand 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.150
 Like that, so I will not do it. 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.140
 playing in multiplayer i will not close 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.300
 nobody's door 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.830
 the guy is running a lot faster and 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.660
 I can not keep up 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.880
 I'm not going to open it, then I'll go 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.740
 stand there in front of him 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.180
 I'll hit the fish when I'm doing it. 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.660
 My side I'm going to put the car on 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:20.930
 because what the narration teaches this 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:22.790
 the campaign taught me that for love 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.160
 God's 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:25.820
 speak a little multiplayer now 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.770
 go 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:30.890
 while I'll talk about made boot goes 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.930
 looking at the skidding there I am 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:35.920
 using frei 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:38.660
 Look there, I quit so much smoke. 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:41.420
 recommended machine is a machine returned 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:44.720
 with mental gas mask to power 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:46.550
 play feeling or multiplayer 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.890
 one of the reasons I bought at 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:53.630
 grid on launch day was because 

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:58.730
 I was disappointed in the shape of the 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:06:02.570
 compete of competition and had of the morals 

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:03.830
 the levator was not oral 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:08.450
 fully disclosed 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:12.500
 the leader is people cut path and wore 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:15.020
 the handrail whats the use of the handrail 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:18.530
 if you take a curve like this one here 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:21.249
 and you rancid she whole understood 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:24.219
 looking like tony hawk 

00:06:21.249 --> 00:06:29.529
 the big hit because if you hit a 

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:32.319
 so an objective if you read let me 

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:36.579
 corner and on the railing since the 

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:39.969
 car wheel you for then beauty there 

00:06:36.579 --> 00:06:42.729
 We will not need it, I was 

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:47.379
 looking into the multiplayer and saw that it has 

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:50.799
 races online and will not in this rival and 

00:06:47.379 --> 00:06:56.379
 I have a monthly rival type of organ that 

00:06:50.799 --> 00:07:01.269
 it's the mantle in flames 

00:06:56.379 --> 00:07:04.299
 this club is the teaching I do not know 

00:07:01.269 --> 00:07:06.519
 that will give refinetti is legal of the 

00:07:04.299 --> 00:07:08.529
 multiverse of silva 

00:07:06.519 --> 00:07:11.110
 he is independent has nothing to do 

00:07:08.529 --> 00:07:14.319
 with the campaign the campaign campaign and 

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:17.649
 multiplayer to multiplayer you are 

00:07:14.319 --> 00:07:20.070

00:07:17.649 --> 00:07:22.500
 nothing to do with multiplayer

 will be able to play the campaign understood and 

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:27.060
