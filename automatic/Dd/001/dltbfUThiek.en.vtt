00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
to get a little edge of the thumb into

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.290 
to get a little edge of the thumb into
the<00:03:13.920> pic<00:03:14.190> attack<00:03:14.519> just<00:03:14.760> to<00:03:14.880> make<00:03:15.030> it<00:03:15.150> sound

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
the pic attack just to make it sound

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:21.259 
the pic attack just to make it sound
sharp<00:03:15.720> or<00:03:15.959> a<00:03:15.989> little<00:03:16.230> nastier<00:03:16.680> and<00:03:20.150> then<00:03:21.150> I

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
sharp or a little nastier and then I

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:29.600 
sharp or a little nastier and then I
shoot<00:03:21.540> up<00:03:26.090> so<00:03:27.890> this<00:03:28.890> is<00:03:29.040> still<00:03:29.310> minor

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
shoot up so this is still minor

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:37.160 
shoot up so this is still minor
pentatonic<00:03:30.000> in<00:03:30.600> a<00:03:35.480> you<00:03:36.480> push<00:03:36.720> that<00:03:36.900> minor

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
pentatonic in a you push that minor

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.860 
pentatonic in a you push that minor
third<00:03:37.440> up<00:03:37.590> a<00:03:37.709> little<00:03:37.890> so<00:03:38.069> it<00:03:38.190> sounds<00:03:38.519> major<00:03:38.870> and

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
third up a little so it sounds major and

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.809 
third up a little so it sounds major and
then<00:03:40.110> I'm<00:03:40.230> alternating<00:03:40.739> different<00:03:41.430> notes<00:03:41.610> on

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
then I'm alternating different notes on

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.410 
then I'm alternating different notes on
the<00:03:41.880> high<00:03:42.030> E<00:03:42.060> string<00:03:42.180> against<00:03:42.840> that<00:03:44.420> minor

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
the high E string against that minor

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:52.360 
the high E string against that minor
third<00:03:45.780> that<00:03:46.049> sounds<00:03:46.349> like<00:03:46.410> a<00:03:46.500> major<00:03:46.650> third

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:04:01.130 

then<00:03:53.370> on<00:03:53.489> the<00:03:53.610> five<00:03:53.819> chord<00:03:54.209> E<00:03:59.720> I'm<00:04:00.720> playing<00:04:01.019> a

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
then on the five chord E I'm playing a

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.310 
then on the five chord E I'm playing a
lick<00:04:01.350> that<00:04:02.510> does<00:04:03.510> the<00:04:03.690> same<00:04:03.720> thing<00:04:03.930> we<00:04:04.170> just

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
lick that does the same thing we just

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:11.780 
lick that does the same thing we just
did<00:04:04.470> an<00:04:04.739> A<00:04:07.310> flat<00:04:08.310> seven<00:04:08.940> six<00:04:09.269> five<00:04:09.780> over<00:04:10.410> E<00:04:10.790> same

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
did an A flat seven six five over E same

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:18.050 
did an A flat seven six five over E same
thing<00:04:12.030> on<00:04:12.150> the<00:04:12.239> four<00:04:12.450> chord<00:04:12.690> D<00:04:16.820> intervallic<00:04:17.820> ly

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
thing on the four chord D intervallic ly

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.240 
thing on the four chord D intervallic ly
those<00:04:18.239> are<00:04:18.450> the<00:04:18.510> flat<00:04:18.720> seven<00:04:19.200> six<00:04:19.470> and<00:04:19.739> five<00:04:19.919> of

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
those are the flat seven six and five of

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:26.690 
those are the flat seven six and five of
D<00:04:20.750> and<00:04:21.750> then<00:04:22.620> we<00:04:22.710> go<00:04:22.860> back<00:04:23.100> down<00:04:23.400> to<00:04:23.610> a<00:04:25.700> minor

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
D and then we go back down to a minor

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.370 
D and then we go back down to a minor
pentatonic<00:04:26.970> when<00:04:27.479> the<00:04:27.570> progression<00:04:28.020> returns

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
pentatonic when the progression returns

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:40.320 
pentatonic when the progression returns
to<00:04:28.590> the<00:04:28.680> one<00:04:32.990> one<00:04:33.990> more<00:04:34.110> time

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.950 

so<00:04:40.750> this<00:04:40.870> is<00:04:41.020> kind<00:04:41.260> of<00:04:41.320> cool<00:04:42.420> use<00:04:43.420> your<00:04:43.630> pinky

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
so this is kind of cool use your pinky

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.690 
so this is kind of cool use your pinky
to<00:04:44.110> roll<00:04:44.470> over<00:04:44.830> from<00:04:44.980> the<00:04:45.190> bead<00:04:45.370> to<00:04:45.400> the

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
to roll over from the bead to the

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:56.670 
to roll over from the bead to the
g-string<00:04:54.600> get<00:04:55.600> those<00:04:55.810> little<00:04:56.050> expressive

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
g-string get those little expressive

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
g-string get those little expressive
bends<00:04:59.730> into<00:05:00.730> the<00:05:01.090> lick<00:05:01.270> as<00:05:01.450> well
