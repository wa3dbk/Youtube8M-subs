actually<00:01:23.250> go<00:01:23.790> in<00:01:24.780> where<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.560> have<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.799> bit<00:01:26.070> of

actually go in where you have a bit of

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.120 
actually go in where you have a bit of
growth<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.729> not<00:01:26.880> so<00:01:27.150> much<00:01:27.390> like<00:01:27.680> two<00:01:28.680> three

weeks worth of growth which is actually

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.050 
weeks worth of growth which is actually
nice<00:01:31.110> because<00:01:31.140> then<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:32.070> can<00:01:32.340> pick<00:01:32.850> out<00:01:33.030> the

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
nice because then you can pick out the

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.990 
nice because then you can pick out the
hair<00:01:33.920> more<00:01:34.920> often<00:01:35.159> than<00:01:35.610> you<00:01:35.700> would<00:01:35.850> with

would just run it up quickly and then I

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.150 
would just run it up quickly and then I
didn't<00:03:26.810> worry<00:03:27.170> so<00:03:27.470> much<00:03:27.530> about<00:03:27.680> getting<00:03:27.980> a

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
didn't worry so much about getting a

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
didn't worry so much about getting a
perfect<00:03:29.140> hairless<00:03:30.250> leg<00:03:31.250> so<00:03:31.670> much<00:03:31.850> as<00:03:32.030> I<00:03:32.120> just

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
perfect hairless leg so much as I just

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.110 
perfect hairless leg so much as I just
worried<00:03:32.900> about<00:03:33.110> getting<00:03:34.040> some<00:03:34.370> of<00:03:34.489> it<00:03:34.610> off<00:03:34.790> and

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
worried about getting some of it off and

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.150 
worried about getting some of it off and
then<00:03:35.269> going<00:03:35.570> back<00:03:35.600> in<00:03:35.959> the<00:03:36.290> next<00:03:36.500> night

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
then going back in the next night

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.039 
then going back in the next night
now<00:03:37.340> all<00:03:37.730> the<00:03:37.940> hair<00:03:38.150> is<00:03:38.360> growing<00:03:38.570> back<00:03:38.720> at

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
now all the hair is growing back at

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:42.100 
now all the hair is growing back at
different<00:03:39.440> rates<00:03:39.709> so<00:03:40.430> it<00:03:40.880> never<00:03:41.420> hurts<00:03:41.870> as

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
different rates so it never hurts as

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.949 
different rates so it never hurts as
much<00:03:42.170> as<00:03:42.440> it<00:03:42.860> did<00:03:43.040> in<00:03:43.310> the<00:03:43.760> first<00:03:43.790> time<00:03:44.420> because

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:44.959 
much as it did in the first time because

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.520 
much as it did in the first time because
there's<00:03:45.530> just<00:03:45.860> less<00:03:46.310> hair<00:03:46.760> over<00:03:47.450> the<00:03:48.170> same

area it's pulling it less hair so it

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:53.920 
area it's pulling it less hair so it
hurts<00:03:51.290> less<00:03:51.590> basically<00:03:52.459> and<00:03:52.790> I've<00:03:53.600> gotten

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
hurts less basically and I've gotten

were particularly painful you'll notice
that<00:03:58.610> some<00:03:58.850> areas<00:03:59.209> are<00:03:59.390> extremely<00:03:59.840> painful

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
that some areas are extremely painful

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.210

like this area right here was super

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.260 
like this area right here was super
painful<00:04:04.570> because<00:04:05.570> it's<00:04:05.810> just<00:04:06.020> so<00:04:06.200> sensitive

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:07.270

some reason and then the the back of the

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:18.660 
some reason and then the the back of the
knee<00:04:16.600> were<00:04:16.959> like<00:04:17.260> the<00:04:17.440> leg<00:04:17.620> folds<00:04:18.160> that<00:04:18.250> that

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
going like a little bit at a time say I

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.660 
going like a little bit at a time say I
take<00:04:26.200> my<00:04:26.350> hairline<00:04:26.710> as<00:04:26.920> an<00:04:27.040> example<00:04:27.340> I'm<00:04:27.640> not

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:27.670 
take my hairline as an example I'm not

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:28.950 
take my hairline as an example I'm not
obviously<00:04:28.180> not<00:04:28.330> going<00:04:28.420> to<00:04:28.480> appellate<00:04:28.840> my

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
obviously not going to appellate my

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.190 
obviously not going to appellate my
hairline<00:04:29.290> but<00:04:29.860> I<00:04:30.190> would<00:04:30.490> go<00:04:30.760> like<00:04:31.180> this<00:04:31.720> and

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
hairline but I would go like this and

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.360 
hairline but I would go like this and
then<00:04:32.650> inch<00:04:32.980> closer<00:04:34.020> rather<00:04:35.020> than<00:04:35.350> like<00:04:35.680> go

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
then inch closer rather than like go

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.070 
then inch closer rather than like go
into<00:04:36.670> the<00:04:36.760> middle<00:04:37.060> of<00:04:37.180> it<00:04:37.300> because<00:04:37.480> that<00:04:37.840> would

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
into the middle of it because that would

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.020 
into the middle of it because that would
that<00:04:38.470> would<00:04:38.530> really<00:04:38.920> hurt<00:04:39.220> and<00:04:39.520> and<00:04:39.850> that's

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
that would really hurt and and that's

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:42.810 
that would really hurt and and that's
how<00:04:40.210> I<00:04:40.240> just<00:04:40.630> cope<00:04:40.810> coped<00:04:41.380> with<00:04:41.620> the<00:04:41.740> pain

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
how I just cope coped with the pain

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.550 
how I just cope coped with the pain
I<00:04:42.910> didn't<00:04:43.330> go<00:04:43.420> any<00:04:43.630> further<00:04:43.690> than<00:04:43.990> like<00:04:44.410> the

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
I didn't go any further than like the

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.190 
I didn't go any further than like the
bikini<00:04:44.890> side<00:04:45.160> so<00:04:45.460> I'm<00:04:45.850> not<00:04:46.480> about<00:04:46.690> to<00:04:46.750> lose<00:04:47.020> my

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
bikini side so I'm not about to lose my

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.890 
bikini side so I'm not about to lose my
clip<00:04:47.500> with<00:04:47.680> a<00:04:47.710> machine<00:04:48.210> that's<00:04:49.210> just<00:04:49.420> scary<00:04:49.810> to

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
clip with a machine that's just scary to

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.810 
clip with a machine that's just scary to
me<00:04:50.200> what's<00:04:50.710> really<00:04:50.920> cool<00:04:51.070> about<00:04:51.130> it<00:04:51.460> is<00:04:51.490> that

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
me what's really cool about it is that

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.450 
me what's really cool about it is that
if<00:04:52.090> it's<00:04:52.330> plugged<00:04:52.660> in<00:04:52.930> it<00:04:53.200> will<00:04:53.470> not<00:04:53.770> turn<00:04:54.130> on

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
if it's plugged in it will not turn on

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
if it's plugged in it will not turn on
so<00:04:55.060> that's<00:04:55.330> the<00:04:55.600> safety<00:04:55.990> function<00:04:56.440> for<00:04:56.770> not

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:57.480 
so that's the safety function for not

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.840 
so that's the safety function for not
for<00:04:58.480> not<00:04:59.070> electrocuting<00:05:00.070> you<00:05:00.220> while<00:05:00.520> wet

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
for not electrocuting you while wet

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:03.060 
for not electrocuting you while wet
basically<00:05:01.840> and<00:05:02.080> you're<00:05:02.440> obviously<00:05:02.650> going<00:05:03.010> to

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
basically and you're obviously going to

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.340 
basically and you're obviously going to
want<00:05:03.250> to<00:05:03.370> wait<00:05:03.550> until<00:05:03.820> the<00:05:04.600> connection<00:05:05.140> part

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350 
want to wait until the connection part

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.500 
want to wait until the connection part
dries<00:05:05.830> before<00:05:06.250> you<00:05:06.580> plug<00:05:06.880> it<00:05:07.000> in<00:05:07.120> and<00:05:07.150> start

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
dries before you plug it in and start

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:11.100 
dries before you plug it in and start
charging<00:05:08.080> it<00:05:08.200> again<00:05:08.820> and<00:05:09.820> it's<00:05:10.540> best<00:05:10.840> for<00:05:11.020> you

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
charging it again and it's best for you

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.500 
charging it again and it's best for you
to<00:05:11.230> charge<00:05:11.500> it<00:05:11.740> after<00:05:12.280> ever<00:05:12.490> use<00:05:12.880> to<00:05:13.180> make<00:05:13.330> sure

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.030 
to charge it after ever use to make sure
that<00:05:13.720> it<00:05:13.840> doesn't<00:05:14.020> run<00:05:14.260> out<00:05:14.290> of<00:05:14.410> battery<00:05:14.800> while

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
painful first time on every part of the

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.220 
painful first time on every part of the
body<00:05:39.490> that<00:05:39.610> I've<00:05:39.880> tried<00:05:40.150> so<00:05:40.450> far<00:05:40.720> and<00:05:40.900> I<00:05:40.990> just

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:41.230 
body that I've tried so far and I just

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:42.990 
body that I've tried so far and I just
got<00:05:41.380> a<00:05:41.410> tough<00:05:41.740> through<00:05:42.040> the<00:05:42.220> pits<00:05:42.460> because<00:05:42.820> I

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000 
got a tough through the pits because I

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.780 
got a tough through the pits because I
feel<00:05:43.390> like<00:05:43.620> armpits<00:05:44.620> would<00:05:44.770> be<00:05:44.890> a<00:05:44.920> really<00:05:45.340> good

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:45.790 
feel like armpits would be a really good

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:47.280 
feel like armpits would be a really good
thing<00:05:46.300> to<00:05:46.600> have<00:05:46.690> epilating

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:47.290 
thing to have epilating

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:48.600 
thing to have epilating
because<00:05:47.530> otherwise<00:05:47.710> I<00:05:47.860> have<00:05:48.100> to<00:05:48.190> run<00:05:48.370> a<00:05:48.400> razor

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
because otherwise I have to run a razor

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.720 
because otherwise I have to run a razor
over<00:05:49.030> them<00:05:49.180> all<00:05:49.390> the<00:05:49.630> time<00:05:49.840> and<00:05:50.370> then<00:05:51.370> the

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:51.730 
over them all the time and then the

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:54.900 
over them all the time and then the
advantage<00:05:52.270> to<00:05:52.990> this<00:05:53.169> over<00:05:53.800> waxing<00:05:54.490> is<00:05:54.700> that

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:54.910 
advantage to this over waxing is that

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:56.580 
advantage to this over waxing is that
you<00:05:55.060> can<00:05:55.210> actually<00:05:55.360> do<00:05:55.690> it<00:05:55.810> in<00:05:55.930> between<00:05:56.080> wax

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:56.590 
you can actually do it in between wax

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:59.370 
you can actually do it in between wax
sessions<00:05:57.190> and<00:05:57.490> it<00:05:57.700> doesn't<00:05:58.150> rip<00:05:58.840> off<00:05:59.050> a<00:05:59.080> layer

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380 
sessions and it doesn't rip off a layer

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.280 
sessions and it doesn't rip off a layer
of<00:05:59.620> your<00:05:59.740> skin<00:05:59.800> the<00:06:00.700> way<00:06:00.820> waxing<00:06:01.300> does<00:06:01.510> so<00:06:01.840> it

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:02.290 
of your skin the way waxing does so it

00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:04.530 
of your skin the way waxing does so it
never<00:06:02.500> hurts<00:06:02.860> to<00:06:03.130> go<00:06:03.250> over<00:06:03.640> the<00:06:03.760> same<00:06:04.000> areas

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:04.540 
never hurts to go over the same areas

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:07.020 
never hurts to go over the same areas
because<00:06:05.530> it's<00:06:06.250> just<00:06:06.430> going<00:06:06.550> to<00:06:06.640> hurt<00:06:06.820> in<00:06:06.940> a

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.030 
because it's just going to hurt in a

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:08.400 
because it's just going to hurt in a
different<00:06:07.360> place<00:06:07.600> because<00:06:07.630> it's<00:06:07.960> pulling<00:06:08.290> out

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:08.410 
different place because it's pulling out

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.350 
different place because it's pulling out
a<00:06:08.440> different<00:06:08.830> hair<00:06:09.130> as<00:06:09.370> opposed<00:06:09.970> to<00:06:10.060> the<00:06:10.210> hair

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:10.360 
a different hair as opposed to the hair

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.790 
a different hair as opposed to the hair
that's<00:06:10.540> already<00:06:10.600> been<00:06:10.870> pulled<00:06:11.169> out<00:06:11.320> when
