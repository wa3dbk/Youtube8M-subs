00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 ok the video saying yes 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.220
 this video reaches 2,000 likes later 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:09.570
 Later I will have a video of pro 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:13.730
 player there I leave it rf x of go beyond 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:17.400
 of the streak on the white as the name 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.050
 it's basically like lr fx de del black 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.680
 ops 2 that will be included in the 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:24.359
 whites 3 pity that when it detonates here 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.010
 the black mate ends with the 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.310
 discussion leave your channel when 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.289
 detonates the car gives you to choose marker 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.360
 for the vest talking about gilmar that is 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.030
 much more said that the sniper is 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.489
 the locus looks like a lot of hits 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.530
 markets and the programs I got the other 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.329
 day I do not what we think on the site 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.730
 He was the one who thought it and the truth is that 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.440
 So it seems very sensible and very logical 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.450
 I 'm going to say the following on 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.800
 sniper takes to fast fire the 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.930
 story and every time he fired a bullet 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.239
 the sniper makes the bolt fucked 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.670
 that is, does it very fast does it mean 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.449
 that perhaps with taking fire fast the 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.760
 damage of the sneijder will be diminished 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:04.409
 who knows who knows what the 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.670
 counter of vale if you want to do the 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.210
 bolt faster you go 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.070
 but it's going to hit you more and more than the 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:14.399
 sniper because it will have less damage in 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.170
 I have to tell you that now I'm going to put 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:18.979
 a piece with the submachine gun there 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.780
 download the help package and gorgeous 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:24.990
 I come to say about what I have seen 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.399
 of white 3 all the kilitos and I 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.170
 I have a 15 minute gameplay of 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:29.549
 talk that I've seen was part of the 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.680
 rest of videos that I've seen and everything 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.430
 that is insinuating whites 3 is going to 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.650
 be white 3 a good game 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.870
 new york or catch your fingers because no 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.910
 I'm going to see how with captives like 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.460
 with caw two days vance wolfart to say 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.920
 ok this game is going to be wire game 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.500
 how much and in the end that I grasp what 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.170
 I've seen I like what I've seen of 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.780
 moment I like it means that this 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.170
 game then without having played it and without 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.300
 have tried anything I can say that I'm going to 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.470
 I love this game, obviously not 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.630
 I've tried it I can not say that I 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:07.260
 It seems like a good game and also this is the 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.720
 alpha or alpha alpha is to say that still 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.670
 there is nothing touched that can then 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.980
 that you take this out and patch the dcr not 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.659
 it's not like that you understand me the simile 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.430
 and they can do a lot of great 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:20.470
 fact they were saying that the peepholes 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.120
 of the snipers were not going to 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.830
 put how they were now you miss that 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.530
 I told you that as good in this example 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:30.040
 as pointed out with sneijder that you see the 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:33.040
 around is blurred as one of 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.900
 optique karma told him to ponder what not 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.640
 he liked those three of me that he 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.599
 he preferred to look at it like the one in white 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:42.280
 2 that so black smooth that he preferred it in 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:44.950
 where then they said that maybe 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.410
 put it back where you do not have to 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.000
 negotiate with this I mean you can 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.760
 there are many changes during these months 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.170
 in cartilage 3 that is to say is that still 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.730
 the game is not finished at one hundred 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.230
 one hundred and there can be many changes 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.239
 what I like 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.000
 what I 've seen like I like that is 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:03.069
 true but then maybe try the game 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.140
 and say yes it's true that when 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:07.900
 the trailers of the multiplayer of 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.910
 advanced world war said my mother how 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.920
 is going to be this to play with him snyder 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.739
 this is going to be frankly it was from others 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.829
 however, what I'm seeing from the 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:20.739
 gameplay the sperm are also worth when 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:22.000
 jim markets people are going on the ground 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.970
 that is , people 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.769
 bynum in a plane except for 10 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.049
 panel on when jumping a boat fi 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:30.940
 or something but it's nothing like cadel evans 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:34.200
 war park that we are going to 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.370
 and I do not like to play with him 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.410
 what do you people think of what 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.450
 you have seen it is too early to tell if 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:43.180
 it's a good game if it really is not going to 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.590
 worth it to black ops 3 but we 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.660
 it seems to you I want you to tell me in 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.970
 the comments in an orderly manner and if 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.640
 they enjoyed among you what you think 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.140
 of what you have seen at the moment 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.720
 3 white or transmits good feelings 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.610
 you do not like the movements that are 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.040
 seeing all the skills so that 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:02.380
 there are ten characters that each one has 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:06.090
 an ability that seems to you that 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.090
 they are copying quite a lot of destiny 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:15.160
 the comments seems what you are 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:17.140
 watching from black ops 3 and if you think it's going 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.850
 to be a good game we can do 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.980
 been a kind of debate in the 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:24.490
 comments always from the respect for 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:26.560
 course and nothing when the goal comes in 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.560
 summer we'll check if this one 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.450
 It's cool if it's not so cool if you have 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.550
 good mobility if you can play very 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.230
 well we will not be checking little to 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.430
 little but for now we think that 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:37.720
 agglutinate 23 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.040
 do not forget about the point of the video 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:45.300
 It reaches 2,000 likes then in the afternoon 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:45.300
 well well come back pro player chau
