 It is national preference. 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.089
 our daily bread is like this 

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:11.579
 made of white flour 

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:13.349
 So are Paul leaving. 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.349

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.580
 wasted 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.210
 and this looks like the square of laziness married 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.420
 What does she have to do? 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.420
 she has fibers have minerals in antioxidants 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.230
 has several beneficial components to health 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.350
 in our daily bread 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.070
 the common program 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:59.520
 nothing to enjoy 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.520
 practically nothing 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.110
 the first is from the country cereal laboratory 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.610
 the faculty director 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.750
 unicamp food engineering can see in detail why 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.380
 loses in the production of white flour 25 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.410
 25% of a product 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.340
 imported at last treats that today is eating this wealth 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.260
 animals normally 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.790
 this part this by-product of the grain of wheat it is used in animal feed 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.100
 so we are losing many nutrients that could be used 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.130
 in the feeding the hand the bark of the coconut and matias of seven layers ricardinho 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.399
 fiber and mineral protein vitamins of complex b without mentioning the roofs o 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.670
 embryo of cellulite loaded with drinks that your vote in transit 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.270
 It was to enjoy it better. 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.429
 all this 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:01.240
 that the researcher camila batista da silva 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.540
 developed in the laboratory 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.760
 the whole wheat bread 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.520
 in the grinding process 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:14.170
 all harvested until the germ that is usually discarded even in the called 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.749
 whole grain bread 

00:02:15.749 --> 00:02:17.789
 mark difference of s paulo 

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:21.869
 integrate the so-called life of the institute's employees. 

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:24.029
 they did here 

00:02:24.029 --> 00:02:28.650
 at the end of one year the decision is made on the wheat bran that 

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:29.440
 House 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.980
 in white flour who knows wherever he has to where they 

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:36.949
 the wheat flour should have what makes it what we are using 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:40.209
 it contains all the components 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.889
 that the body contains is not factor that June 15 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:46.979
 who also wants the proportions is difficult 

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:50.809
 to get to real net revenue the 6 shirt kicked over landmarks 

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:54.369
 this time for the lightest brand 

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:56.219
 it was almost two years 

00:02:56.219 --> 00:02:59.219
 work to arrive 

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:04.149
 but this index even scored 

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:06.049
 chickpea flour 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:08.159
 salt pips 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:09.299
 yeast 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.209
 a little vegetable fat 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.209
 struggle to give water water 

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:19.059
 are enzymes and technology 

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:22.059
 used in making the kit makes no difference 

00:03:22.839 --> 00:03:24.459
 pure and on saturday 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:25.869
 are kept 

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:30.069
 they have a shorter shelf life they lasted less than the van with a weak 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:31.209
 of mind 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.199
 and it's good for the country to have peace 

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:36.350
 had a crumbly crusty pasta 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.350
 the felipão is softer 

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:41.629
 the bread that comes out of the oven 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:44.629
 it's delicious 

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:49.840
 and presented to unicamp students I do with the greatest success 

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:57.039
 it's in this climate 

00:03:57.039 --> 00:04:00.039
 and give the impression that the crisis is serious 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:03.909
 through the house 

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:06.909
 for example we are doing 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:10.449
 where in the city of são paulo 

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:11.979
 in the west of Santa Catarina 

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:13.249
 with all components 

00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:14.279
 present in the grain 

00:04:14.279 --> 00:04:18.419
 the strike is to win so for me I have no doubt 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:19.769
 Do you think the industry 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.559
 should take better advantage of 

00:04:21.559 --> 00:04:24.009
 sure is a great potential 

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:27.229
 and nowadays with consumers are more concerned about health 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:32.870
 so they are looking for more natural foods with less adherence to 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.559
 chemical additives 

00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:38.169
 and also products with fibers with high content of antioxidants 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:42.599
 and this wheat flour contains all these layers 

00:04:43.309 --> 00:04:47.449
 she helps her in preventing the river to reduce the risk of diseases 

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:48.710
 cardiovascular 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.499
 of adherent obesity 

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:53.499
 and classic 

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:59.389
 we were always good news if the improvised snack was made 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:02.289
 supertufão ended up living fun videos
