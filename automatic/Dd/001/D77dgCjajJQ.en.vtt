00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 in this video we go to know three 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.509
 fundamental commands for the 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:08.910
 transformation of objects into 3d 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.160
 study max that is the command exposed to 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.200
 wheel escara before starting however 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.750
 I would exit with the right button in 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.359
 this position also the bar of the 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.390
 instruments binds on the axes because then 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.210
 it will be clearer to view the movements 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.750
 of our objects along the xy axes 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:31.800
 let's put a simple object on the plane 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.500
 xy that I know a pyramid we position ourselves 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.280
 in the perspective window here is the 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.350
 our pyramid if I click and select 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.200
 on the toolbar 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.120
 the select icon displayed in is object 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.340
 in the perspective window comes 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.469
 surrounded by these white braces 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.960
 or true, however, that is selected 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.750
 because in the other windows it becomes di 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.610
 this ghismo also appears in white 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.800
 which is a set of three axes that 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.020
 represents the possibility of 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.920
 move the object along the plane in the 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.589
 three directions 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.380
 note that if I dwell on a 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:11.070
 axis for example that of the former that the 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:14.250
 red color and I click the object comes 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:18.180
 bound in the movement along this 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:23.549
 axis let's take another long example 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:26.340
 the z- axis is along the y-axis 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.950
 that is, the technique is this we pass over 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.759
 with the mouse just turned yellow 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.750
 I click with the left exposed long 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.180
 that direction 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.509
 obviously also for the others 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.509
 windows 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:48.010
 observe that if I step over into 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:50.229
 this point becomes yellow too 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.690
 this square means that 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:57.640
 travel will now be in operation 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:02:01.869
 of the zx plan always note this 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:07.600
 window that turns on the floor 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:10.200
 interested for moving then in 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.209
 so let's say the one with the mouse 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.760
 going to take the interested axis or 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.080
 the plan that interests us for it 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.180
 shift 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.220
 this with regard to and I said to him 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.750
 manual movements if I want 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.940
 insert in a precise way 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.120
 parameters I do right click above 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.570
 this icon appears this tai window 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.970
 table 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:32.980
 where can I enter values ​​on 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.870
 left these values ​​will be in 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.330
 absolute manner that is referred to 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.790
 global coordinate system of 3d 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.239
 max study while the values ​​entered on 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.380
 this part on the right side will be 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.930
 related to the last position 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.239
 of the object that is the displacement will come 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.030
 implemented starting from the collection 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:54.790
 current of this pyramid 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.850
 if I insert that I know the object 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.829
 it is moved 20 centimeters long 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.320
 the axis of the former with respect to the last one 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:04.630
 position if my parameters instead li 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.840
 I put suwon here on the left side 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:10.989
 then I insert three zeros that object to me 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.540
 will be placed in the center of my 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.260
 global coordinate system of such 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.410
 study max 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.280
 here it is anchism has been centered 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.130
 on the intersection of the Cartesian axes 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.750
 this window proposes it again here 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.820
 below you can find a studio so we can 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.640
 delete it and have the same effect 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.739
 then in this case the values ​​they are 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:33.420
 inserted below concern obviously 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.420
 the respective axes in this
