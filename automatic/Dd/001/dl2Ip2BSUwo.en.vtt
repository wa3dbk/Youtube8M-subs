00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.750
 hello how about towers pilfered 2000 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.279
 welcome to this new video where I'm going 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.650
 to talk about a new related detail 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:20.570
 with metal gear solid 5 as you know 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.369
 this first week of March 2015 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.349
 we have known the release date 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:27.230
 of metal gear solid 5 and with them 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:29.540
 enough details about the game as 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.189
 its collectible editions one of 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.680
 these presented editions is the one that 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.809
 will come with a playstation 4 decorated 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.390
 with motives of the writing game 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:40.309
 the images a fantastic and 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.550
 wonderful playstation 4 red 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.570
 with some golden detail that according to us 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.510
 he said 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:50.899
 Colima on your own kojima station is 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.839
 based on the biomechanical arm that it carries 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:55.730
 venom snake in the game the problem is 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:57.679
 that this console unfortunately does not 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.899
 will reach European territory or the rest 

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:01.550
 of territories that are not Asia because 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.649
 have presented the console only as 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.860
 asian territory the news is that 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:08.750
 konami has echoed the protests 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.670
 of the fans and the people of the rest of the 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.890
 world of not being able to enjoy this 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.200
 console in your house and have launched a 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.030
 communicated on the game channel portal in the 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.080
 which explain that the console would have the 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.240
 launch in europe 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.370
 North America simple station considered 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.380
 will consider that there is enough 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:27.380
 product demand what do you mean 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.440
 And this I guess if people ask 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.200
 that console let's say asking for it 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:36.080
 in the legs where we reserve the game 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:40.510
 or the stores really ask 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:44.080
 sonny that I publish this console in 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:46.360
 to be able to sell it if the demand of the 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.350
 product as such of explained is very 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.320
 big 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.840
 sonny and konami could reconsider this 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.080
 to take out the console exclusively in 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.460
 Asian territory and can launch it in 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.800
 world or in the territory where 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.780
 demand the product for example in 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.270
 Europe or in North America or in or at the same time 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.180
 in several regions have not given more 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:10.960
 details about it I guess this is going 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:13.540
 related to wanting to sell x number of 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.030
 consoles so that a sony comes out 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.710
 profitable if they think they can reach 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.320
 that number of sales would not have 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:23.110
 problem in launching the console in others 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.150
 territories but as I said I repeat myself 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.560
 they have not given any details or more so 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.560
 we can only wait 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.200
 questions you already know in stores and give 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.170
 hype to this console try to get it 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.209
 to konami are already and truly this 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.090
 product demand so that you know and 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:43.250
 see that the fans love her, not even 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.050
 only fans but anyone who is 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.819
 waiting for the game to be able to buy 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.700
 the console then what better than power 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:51.349
 buy the one with a special edition and 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.230
 in addition an exclusive console 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:55.760
 I think the console is beautiful with 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.040
 more than the red or white that we have 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.720
 seen this is the news is 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.730
 truly the only thing we know 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.830
 sure is that the launch of the 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.230
 game will occur on September 1 the 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:08.540
 September 1st we will leave doubts of 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.840
 all the theories that are talked about 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.580
 in the network and nothing else I hope that has 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.400
