00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 hello I had you in one of my 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.990
 previous videos the different ones 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.940
 presented methods for tick protection 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.219
 and also told you that I am currently 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.530
 the vermin neck found by dm 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.969
 just test it and after six weeks 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.830
 wanted to give a feedback 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.210
 as you wanted to communicate what in 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.080
 the comments below this video 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.640
 was posted 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.109
 I am very satisfied with this 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.760
 collar I have within these six 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.340
 weeks not possible a single tick 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.980
 found and just for almost daily 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.529
 at least one we were also at the 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.270
 places at the ikarus especially tecan 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.579
 brought home and just 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.410
 also relatively common in the forest on the 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.969
 packaging states that it is at six 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.410
 weeks of protection against ticks 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.730
 and I just have it with us 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.140
 a little longer to let it happen 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.460
 look at this time maybe 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.800
 also can withstand a bit and 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.110
 have the first corner after exactly six 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.710
 Weeks and I believe four days 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.600
 found 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.250
 ikarus was also in the water from time to time 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.719
 Therefore, a shelf life of six weeks 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.579
 is guaranteed in any case 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.340
 After that you should get a new house 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.480
 Buy what you have to say is that 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.550
 One has one in the first two weeks 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.290
 really strong smells that makes 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.240
 but nothing there the smell relative 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.070
 pleasant it was even more like that 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.570
 that friends and acquaintances asked me 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.770
 what does smell so good here and why 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.020
 I then explain that had just 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.549
 This household tape is the smell 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.020
 but it will vanish within two weeks 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.210
 and it only has to be perceived if 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.310
 one to the dog so far as really close 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.930
 so no problem with me 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.610
 I'm really happy for ikarus 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.080
 with this heater and have already 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.150
 bought a new one 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.890
 I have the collar also others 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.580
 Test dog owners with their dogs 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.100
 let go and came along 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.360
 that is probably not suitable 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.890
 is who dogs with very long and very 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.840
 dense field like for example 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.610
 Canadian Shepherds there has become 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.160
 the effect as I experienced it 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.870
 I have not adjusted myself very much 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.580
 happy about the resonance under mine 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.110
 last video and about yours 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.060
 experience reports only the 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.160
 ticks and ticks 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.160
 the opinions we were actually 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.950
 already in sight relatively controversial Sun 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.480
 some swear by fast food products 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.520
 and others report allergic 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.830
 reactions in some has a neck 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.420
 when super works other reports 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.340
 that there is no such thing at all 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.840
 Nevertheless, it has achieved many effects 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.940
 thanks for the many and very 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.620
 detailed reports that determined 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.450
 people who do not know exactly 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.900
 which corner protectors you use 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.120
 want 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.440
 So you will find it helpful to help 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.790
 not yet know what tick protection 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.040
 want to use medium then looks 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.940
 just in my old video in the 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.980
 Comments 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.570
 through the soul and maybe you can 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.000
 then made a better decision 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.200
 the link to the original video with 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.390
 I have you in the comments 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.280
 infobox links as on the link to 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.050
 my facebook post on the still 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.970
 times different experience reports 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.019
 which was very surprising 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.310
 has and never did before 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.430
 was the use of 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.470
 coconut oil so an oil that you just 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.090
 incorporated into the dog's coat and 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.590
 that the ticks should keep away 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.030
 I have thus even no 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.920
 experience made but the number of 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.470
 The people under my video 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.760
 have mentioned is relatively much 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.530
 promising and also in mine 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.239
 circle I have that then the 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.470
 heard six times last six weeks 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.660
 So it's definitely a try 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.940
 worth and that is just my conclusion 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.380
 if you do not have ticks for 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.420
 have found you then try it on 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.760
 for example, the herbal 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.459
 Collars made of or just coconut oil 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.160
 or other not so hard chemical 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.620
 medium and if that does not work or 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.060
 does not bring the desired success then 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.020
 you can still do that 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.360
 decide so hard 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.980
 just to attack spot I hope you 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.660
 can with this video and also with 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.700
 the help of the comments below my 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.230
 decide which video better 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.180
 the best for you and your dog 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.660
 is and to say to us again 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.660
 next time 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.380
 I have two claims from you here 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:44.630
 I link to the one on the top 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.910
 bild you come to a playlist where you
