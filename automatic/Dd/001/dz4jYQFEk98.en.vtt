 Danube 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.810
 Well, since the text expresses this one is beginning to happen 

00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:12.599
 while a small demonstration of we can make an image 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:18.329
 here we have the desk after similar to windows on the summit it 

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:19.370
 stack time 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:20.939
 copying more 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.849
 and well, here we could have the different hard drives that we have in the 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:28.399
 computer for boys 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:30.310
 the people of good 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.960
 the bottom is like the most striking 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.210
 it is the whole 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.610
 and here on the outside we can have shortcuts to the applications that 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.930
 we use more common 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.450
 in addition to a direct access it is very at the end 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.390
 simple analysis we do to the applications folder 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.060
 that would be something like early foot signs or programs here we have 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.400
 all the applications that we have installed 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.839
 if we wanted to add one of them to the dr 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:57.170
 We consider that we will use very often 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.620
 He also commented that it is here to drag it the team now we want 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:02.450
 place 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.530
 good he the rest of rooms threw brick in a rollover 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.040
 nothing turns out and 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.510
 on the summit asa 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.650
 if for what is fairer and we have to look with magnifying glass the comapas 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.960
 by force we win at each stage 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.110
 was to see more things 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.070
 advantages that this operative has when working and st 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.120
 the charred body the wallet 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.400
 because it allows us to widen the documents in different ways 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.670
 so we're not going to kill them the way that less 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.450
 it's about love pdf files of any kind of program we can 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.050
 even to see them 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.720
 without having to open 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.360
 we have visualized we approach them this makes us the preview that the 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.450
 formal appearance by the pages 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.410
 as if from an abortion 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.240
 four ties is quite comfortable each lekic pig then it has opened 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.210
 swim 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.720
 percent 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.720
 now we go for the cards because we can do it 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.960
 directly by this ap those decrees that we can place here 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.530
 omo of our sets as the circuit in Seville 

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:14.859
 i separate shotgun / file shots in particular 

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:17.549
 I pay my bills 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:20.549
 we see here the highest ascension of power 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.659
 sara the program that are prisoners the percent set is 

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:28.039
 one of the compatible programs 

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:30.879

 hanin 

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:35.939
 another way to visualize the archives would be state the commune many analysts 

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:41.739
 that would be visualize by cards for example we are moving by 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.719
 folders let's say 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:44.979
 11 we go 

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:47.979
 inside the folder something inside another the other 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:52.519
 we are finding different files this would be the clearest way in 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:53.139
 lonely 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:55.309

 we will always meet 

00:02:58.869 --> 00:03:00.939
 the complete route 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:05.229
 but we want to see in a more beautiful original way but I do not know 

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:06.479
 concrete 

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:08.129
 the fine copper what it does 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:10.239
 allows you to view the files 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.109
 this preview as if it were him 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:14.939
 I sell iphone 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:16.789
 by all 

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:18.019

 he urged nobody 

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:17.079
