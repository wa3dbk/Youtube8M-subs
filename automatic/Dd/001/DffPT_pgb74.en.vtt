00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.020
 hello how to check the voltage in 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.049
 outlet 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.849
 if not at hand 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:10.380
 instrumentation 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:19.350
 Well, for this you can use two 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:23.369
 wires here are two wires here they are i 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:27.500
 they have already been cleaned here 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.990
 stripped one red wire 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:37.110
 twist 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:41.550
 Here is such that it was convenient to poke 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:44.520
 vase how and on the second wire do 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:50.010
 twine so it was convenient to fall asleep 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:54.020
 the man did two lines like this one 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:59.280
 occasion red red orange 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:03.500
 the other end is the orange wire we 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:06.479
 leave without change just twisted 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.360
 so that he was more tightly and all but 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.140
 red wire I picked it up 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:17.220
 so that the veins in it speaks thin 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:23.400
 here the thickness of the core somewhere will need 4 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:26.130
 or 3 weave even tens per day here 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:32.150
 no more like this 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:36.299
 we take away one live one belly here we stand 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:41.130
 so here and all the rest of the bend 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:47.189
 so that they do not interfere and here we are left 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:50.659
 one lively once and so here's all 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:54.240
 alive without a change on this whether a 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:57.730
 all stayed on thin liquid 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:01.270
 what the matter is not that when we are empty 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:05.110
 flats wire newspaper touch about 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.930
 the rainbow is this thin one 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.200
 will work as your keeper and you will 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:14.680
 know there is voltage in the outlet or not 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:20.920
 like this take two wires neatly to god 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:29.350
 we will certainly breed as a 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:36.430
 other ends here by inserting into a newspaper here 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:43.270
 one end of steel and there will be a second end 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:44.760
 part further now neatly here 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:50.830
 in this way in some way 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:51.520
 summing sum year and well here 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.959
 have tried 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:58.870
 now think how are you 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:01.300
 dash no need to be as much as possible 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.940
 careful to use the technique 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:10.290
 safety, that is, not to be with us 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:13.180
 stones where are your eyes 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:16.150
 or someone wiring will not suffer 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.890
 photo custodians household appliances not 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.870
 something will not suffer because here 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.790
 this thin posting 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.570
 it worked like a fuse just 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:30.840
 burned out and everyone betray feel not wear well not 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:30.840
 baldness of all good thanks occupying
