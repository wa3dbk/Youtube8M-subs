on here for black back rank issues
wonder<00:00:37.739> if<00:00:37.800> there<00:00:37.920> may<00:00:38.010> be<00:00:38.040> some<00:00:38.280> way<00:00:38.309> to

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
wonder if there may be some way to

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.900

any immediate back rank tactics see this

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.470 
any immediate back rank tactics see this
other<00:00:55.590> idea<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:56.010> Knight<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.340> g5<00:00:56.730> as<00:00:57.000> well<00:00:57.210> but

other idea of Knight to g5 as well but

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.930

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
will make up for that kind of loss of

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.370 
will make up for that kind of loss of
material<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:08.880> started<00:01:09.630> looking<00:01:09.810> at<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.020> bishop

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
material I started looking at the bishop

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.250 
material I started looking at the bishop
being<00:01:10.590> undefended<00:01:11.070> here<00:01:11.280> if<00:01:11.549> that's

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
being undefended here if that's

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.710 
being undefended here if that's
something<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.710> have<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.040> go<00:01:14.520> off<00:01:14.670> in<00:01:14.880> your<00:01:14.909> alarm

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
something to have a go off in your alarm

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.940 
something to have a go off in your alarm
system<00:01:15.780> right

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
system right

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.399 
system right
we<00:01:17.790> king<00:01:18.150> weak<00:01:18.600> areas<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.170> board

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
we king weak areas of the board

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.990 
we king weak areas of the board
undefended<00:01:20.040> pieces<00:01:20.400> these<00:01:20.549> are<00:01:20.610> all<00:01:20.820> things

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
undefended pieces these are all things

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.460 
undefended pieces these are all things
that<00:01:21.119> should<00:01:21.240> go<00:01:21.479> off<00:01:21.600> on<00:01:21.750> your<00:01:21.840> alarm<00:01:22.080> system

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
that should go off on your alarm system

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.320 
that should go off on your alarm system
but<00:01:23.130> I<00:01:23.189> don't<00:01:23.369> see<00:01:23.520> anything<00:01:23.700> concrete<00:01:23.909> Queen

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
but I don't see anything concrete Queen

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.399 
but I don't see anything concrete Queen
to<00:01:24.450> be<00:01:24.540> one<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:24.840> can<00:01:24.960> move<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.259> bishop

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
to be one it can move the bishop

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.050 
to be one it can move the bishop
probably<00:01:25.890> do<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:26.009> number<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.310> squares<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.759> just

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
probably do a number of squares and just

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.950 
probably do a number of squares and just
immediately<00:01:28.939> kind<00:01:29.939> of<00:01:30.090> dismiss<00:01:30.450> this<00:01:30.659> idea

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
immediately kind of dismiss this idea

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.999 
immediately kind of dismiss this idea
you're<00:01:31.079> probably<00:01:31.259> just<00:01:31.439> helping<00:01:31.799> him<00:01:31.860> to

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
you're probably just helping him to

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.170 
you're probably just helping him to
solidify<00:01:32.220> so<00:01:32.490> unless<00:01:32.729> there's<00:01:32.970> some<00:01:33.150> other

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
solidify so unless there's some other

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.590 
solidify so unless there's some other
way<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.479> trick<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.960> Queen<00:01:34.670> off<00:01:35.670> of<00:01:36.000> f8<00:01:36.329> I'm

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
way to trick the Queen off of f8 I'm

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.880 
way to trick the Queen off of f8 I'm
kind<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:36.900> at<00:01:37.049> a<00:01:37.079> loss<00:01:37.229> for<00:01:37.290> this<00:01:37.560> one<00:01:37.710> so<00:01:37.799> we

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
kind of at a loss for this one so we

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:38.899 
kind of at a loss for this one so we
have<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.070> figure<00:01:38.280> out<00:01:38.340> some<00:01:38.579> other<00:01:38.610> way<00:01:38.790> to

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
have to figure out some other way to

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.270 
have to figure out some other way to
create<00:01:39.180> a<00:01:39.210> mating<00:01:39.540> net<00:01:39.659> maybe<00:01:39.979> the<00:01:40.979> ninety

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
create a mating net maybe the ninety

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.300 
create a mating net maybe the ninety
five<00:01:41.460> idea<00:01:42.350> looking<00:01:43.350> back<00:01:43.530> at<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.890> probably

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
five idea looking back at it probably

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.649 
five idea looking back at it probably
the<00:01:44.430> light<00:01:44.610> scores<00:01:44.909> here<00:01:45.090> are<00:01:45.210> a<00:01:45.240> problem

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
the light scores here are a problem

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.149 
the light scores here are a problem
something<00:01:45.869> like<00:01:46.110> Queen<00:01:46.320> h5<00:01:46.680> followed<00:01:47.100> by

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
something like Queen h5 followed by

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.679 
something like Queen h5 followed by
Knight<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.490> j<00:01:47.640> JH<00:01:47.670> five<00:01:47.970> seems<00:01:48.390> sort<00:01:48.630> of

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
Knight to j JH five seems sort of

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.980 
Knight to j JH five seems sort of
passive<00:01:49.170> but<00:01:50.270> there's<00:01:51.270> an<00:01:51.360> okay<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.659> think<00:01:51.780> I

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
passive but there's an okay I think I

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.469 
passive but there's an okay I think I
see<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.200> now<00:01:52.439> yeah<00:01:52.829> so<00:01:52.860> we<00:01:53.670> we<00:01:53.909> can<00:01:54.060> flip<00:01:54.299> the

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
see it now yeah so we we can flip the

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.510 
see it now yeah so we we can flip the
script<00:01:54.780> I<00:01:54.990> consider<00:01:55.380> Knight<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.740> g5<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.340> after

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
script I consider Knight to g5 and after

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.780 
script I consider Knight to g5 and after
rook<00:01:56.670> takes<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:57.030> 558<00:01:57.630> but<00:01:58.070> that's<00:01:59.070> met<00:01:59.460> by<00:01:59.610> rook

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
the rook and then nine to g5 how does he

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.130 
the rook and then nine to g5 how does he
stop<00:02:04.380> made<00:02:04.619> on<00:02:04.740> h7<00:02:05.219> if<00:02:05.520> g6<00:02:06.210> we<00:02:06.390> have<00:02:06.540> Queen<00:02:06.810> f6

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
stop made on h7 if g6 we have Queen f6

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.710

check<00:02:07.530> King<00:02:08.009> to<00:02:08.160> g8<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.670> then<00:02:08.789> Queen<00:02:09.060> f7<00:02:09.360> check

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
check King to g8 and then Queen f7 check

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.490 
check King to g8 and then Queen f7 check
and<00:02:09.899> mate

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
and mate

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.380 
and mate
which<00:02:11.190> means<00:02:11.460> that<00:02:11.610> after<00:02:11.700> rook<00:02:11.970> da<00:02:12.120> truck

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
which means that after rook da truck

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.480 
which means that after rook da truck
takes<00:02:12.600> 95<00:02:13.170> how<00:02:13.350> does<00:02:13.470> he<00:02:13.560> stop<00:02:13.740> made<00:02:13.920> in<00:02:14.040> h7<00:02:14.430> I

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
takes 95 how does he stop made in h7 I

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.250 
takes 95 how does he stop made in h7 I
don't<00:02:14.610> think<00:02:14.730> he<00:02:14.790> can<00:02:14.970> you<00:02:15.570> can<00:02:15.720> run<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.020> King

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
don't think he can you can run the King

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.200 
don't think he can you can run the King
but<00:02:16.590> that's<00:02:16.920> a<00:02:17.040> queen<00:02:17.460> and<00:02:17.580> Knight<00:02:17.730> mating<00:02:18.060> net

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
but that's a queen and Knight mating net

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.660 
but that's a queen and Knight mating net
that<00:02:18.360> we<00:02:18.480> know<00:02:18.630> well<00:02:18.840> I<00:02:19.110> think<00:02:19.410> so<00:02:19.770> we'll<00:02:20.520> just

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
that we know well I think so we'll just

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.700 
that we know well I think so we'll just
be<00:02:20.760> taking<00:02:21.090> h7<00:02:21.540> and<00:02:21.690> checking<00:02:21.930> around<00:02:22.050> yeah<00:02:22.290> no

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
be taking h7 and checking around yeah no

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.500 
be taking h7 and checking around yeah no
reason<00:02:23.040> to<00:02:23.130> give<00:02:23.250> Queen<00:02:23.490> f7<00:02:23.760> check<00:02:24.060> first<00:02:24.300> and

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
reason to give Queen f7 check first and

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.570 
reason to give Queen f7 check first and
then<00:02:24.660> come<00:02:24.840> here<00:02:25.140> because<00:02:25.530> that<00:02:26.370> actually

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
then come here because that actually

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.310 
then come here because that actually
improves<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.180> FETs<00:02:27.360> no<00:02:27.540> I<00:02:27.570> see<00:02:27.840> a<00:02:27.870> force<00:02:28.140> mate

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
improves the FETs no I see a force mate

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.360 
improves the FETs no I see a force mate
anyway<00:02:28.590> okay<00:02:28.890> so<00:02:28.950> check<00:02:29.390> check<00:02:30.390> and<00:02:31.040> mate<00:02:32.040> or

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
anyway okay so check check and mate or

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.630 
anyway okay so check check and mate or
mate<00:02:32.670> next<00:02:32.910> move<00:02:34.250> okay<00:02:35.250> well<00:02:35.400> that<00:02:35.520> was

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
mate next move okay well that was

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.280 
mate next move okay well that was
actually<00:02:35.790> a<00:02:36.240> little<00:02:36.600> tough<00:02:36.750> for<00:02:36.930> me<00:02:37.020> I<00:02:37.050> wonder

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
actually a little tough for me I wonder

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.160 
actually a little tough for me I wonder
why<00:02:37.410> it<00:02:37.470> took<00:02:37.650> me<00:02:37.710> so<00:02:37.830> long<00:02:38.010> to<00:02:38.780> to<00:02:39.780> find<00:02:39.990> rook

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
why it took me so long to to find rook

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.240 
why it took me so long to to find rook
d8<00:02:40.470> 95<00:02:41.040> maybe<00:02:41.850> I'm<00:02:42.000> just<00:02:42.120> a<00:02:42.210> little<00:02:42.420> slow<00:02:42.690> today

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
d8 95 maybe I'm just a little slow today

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.280 
d8 95 maybe I'm just a little slow today
I<00:02:44.630> think<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:47.570> process<00:02:48.570> that<00:02:48.840> I<00:02:48.870> went<00:02:49.230> through

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
I think the process that I went through

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.680 
I think the process that I went through
not<00:02:49.980> seeing<00:02:50.430> this<00:02:50.550> one<00:02:50.760> immediately<00:02:51.209> is<00:02:51.390> maybe

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
not seeing this one immediately is maybe

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.150 
not seeing this one immediately is maybe
even<00:02:51.990> more<00:02:52.140> instructive<00:02:52.620> than<00:02:52.650> ones<00:02:52.950> that<00:02:53.070> I

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
even more instructive than ones that I

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.949 
even more instructive than ones that I
do<00:02:53.250> see<00:02:53.610> immediately<00:02:54.060> and<00:02:54.209> then<00:02:54.360> and<00:02:54.630> then<00:02:54.750> try

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
do see immediately and then and then try

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.760 
do see immediately and then and then try
to<00:02:54.990> find<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.350> best<00:02:55.500> way<00:02:55.680> to<00:02:57.140> do<00:02:58.140> explain<00:02:58.500> some

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
to find the best way to do explain some

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:00.680 
to find the best way to do explain some
sort<00:02:58.980> of<00:02:59.040> educational<00:02:59.850> takeaway<00:03:00.300> some<00:03:00.510> sort

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
sort of educational takeaway some sort

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.630 
sort of educational takeaway some sort
of<00:03:00.720> instructive<00:03:01.200> takeaways<00:03:01.620> but<00:03:01.830> when<00:03:02.520> it

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
of instructive takeaways but when it

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.860 
of instructive takeaways but when it
went<00:03:02.820> in<00:03:02.880> many<00:03:03.030> cases<00:03:03.420> that<00:03:03.600> you<00:03:03.660> know<00:03:03.750> the

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
went in many cases that you know the

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.360 
went in many cases that you know the
pattern<00:03:04.200> is<00:03:04.320> so<00:03:04.470> familiar<00:03:04.980> you<00:03:05.100> get<00:03:05.250> to<00:03:05.340> a

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
pattern is so familiar you get to a

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:06.830 
pattern is so familiar you get to a
point<00:03:05.610> where<00:03:05.790> it's<00:03:05.910> automatic<00:03:06.390> but<00:03:06.540> this<00:03:06.690> was

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
point where it's automatic but this was

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.620 
point where it's automatic but this was
this<00:03:07.830> was<00:03:08.040> it<00:03:08.400> took<00:03:08.520> me<00:03:08.670> a<00:03:08.700> second<00:03:09.120> to<00:03:09.150> see<00:03:09.420> rook

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
this was it took me a second to see rook

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.410 
this was it took me a second to see rook
to<00:03:09.750> d8<00:03:09.870> at<00:03:10.140> least<00:03:10.320> in<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.740> purpose<00:03:11.130> of<00:03:11.280> 90<00:03:11.880> g5<00:03:12.209> I

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
to d8 at least in the purpose of 90 g5 I

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.970 
to d8 at least in the purpose of 90 g5 I
immediately<00:03:12.690> considered<00:03:13.410> the<00:03:13.560> idea<00:03:13.920> of

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
immediately considered the idea of

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.640 
immediately considered the idea of
exposing<00:03:14.670> the<00:03:14.760> back<00:03:14.940> rank<00:03:15.239> but<00:03:16.080> as<00:03:16.230> soon<00:03:16.380> as<00:03:16.530> we

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
exposing the back rank but as soon as we

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:17.960 
exposing the back rank but as soon as we
really<00:03:17.010> saw<00:03:17.190> that<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.459> Queen<00:03:17.670> and<00:03:17.820> rook

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
really saw that the Queen and rook

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.729 
really saw that the Queen and rook
connection<00:03:18.420> here<00:03:18.600> is<00:03:18.630> pretty<00:03:18.840> strong<00:03:19.200> so<00:03:19.560> that

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
connection here is pretty strong so that

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.170 
connection here is pretty strong so that
that's<00:03:19.950> that's<00:03:20.190> not<00:03:20.430> really<00:03:20.730> gonna<00:03:20.850> be<00:03:21.060> the

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
that's that's not really gonna be the

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.330 
that's that's not really gonna be the
main<00:03:21.330> target<00:03:21.600> my<00:03:22.350> first<00:03:22.620> instinct<00:03:22.980> was<00:03:23.010> not<00:03:23.130> to

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
main target my first instinct was not to

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.280 
main target my first instinct was not to
go<00:03:23.640> to<00:03:23.730> Knight<00:03:23.880> g5<00:03:24.209> because<00:03:24.630> I<00:03:24.720> dismissed<00:03:25.140> it

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
go to Knight g5 because I dismissed it

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.650 
go to Knight g5 because I dismissed it
due<00:03:25.440> to<00:03:25.560> rook<00:03:25.709> takes<00:03:25.860> f5<00:03:26.250> or<00:03:26.280> 0f8<00:03:26.970> so<00:03:27.330> my<00:03:27.420> first

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
due to rook takes f5 or 0f8 so my first

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.720 
due to rook takes f5 or 0f8 so my first
instinct<00:03:28.019> was<00:03:28.140> are<00:03:28.709> there<00:03:28.950> any<00:03:29.010> undefended<00:03:29.610> or

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
instinct was are there any undefended or

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.630 
instinct was are there any undefended or
weak<00:03:29.850> pieces<00:03:30.650> and<00:03:31.650> then<00:03:31.830> I<00:03:31.890> went<00:03:32.010> back<00:03:32.130> full

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
weak pieces and then I went back full

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.070 
weak pieces and then I went back full
circle<00:03:32.670> realizing<00:03:33.600> there<00:03:33.720> wasn't<00:03:33.959> something

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
circle realizing there wasn't something

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.449 
circle realizing there wasn't something
concrete<00:03:34.320> and<00:03:34.560> so<00:03:34.769> maybe<00:03:34.950> then<00:03:35.130> you<00:03:35.220> take<00:03:35.430> a

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
concrete and so maybe then you take a

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:36.590 
concrete and so maybe then you take a
look<00:03:35.670> at<00:03:35.790> the<00:03:35.880> weaknesses<00:03:36.420> in<00:03:36.570> your

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
look at the weaknesses in your

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.000 
look at the weaknesses in your
opponent's<00:03:37.110> camp<00:03:37.350> and<00:03:37.620> the<00:03:37.680> kingside

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
opponent's camp and the kingside

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.009 
opponent's camp and the kingside
weaknesses<00:03:38.430> with<00:03:38.580> new<00:03:38.790> eyes<00:03:39.000> looking<00:03:39.840> for

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
weaknesses with new eyes looking for

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.229 
weaknesses with new eyes looking for
something<00:03:40.290> new<00:03:40.320> which<00:03:41.010> is<00:03:41.220> actually<00:03:41.880> often<00:03:42.180> a

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
something new which is actually often a

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.310 
something new which is actually often a
mistake<00:03:42.360> people<00:03:42.900> make<00:03:43.019> when<00:03:44.510> looking<00:03:45.510> for<00:03:45.840> a

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
mistake people make when looking for a

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.350 
mistake people make when looking for a
way<00:03:46.799> to<00:03:46.860> complete<00:03:47.340> their<00:03:47.519> attack<00:03:47.880> this<00:03:48.180> is

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
way to complete their attack this is

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.840 
way to complete their attack this is
this<00:03:48.480> is<00:03:48.660> advice<00:03:48.959> I<00:03:49.200> give<00:03:49.650> I've<00:03:49.950> given<00:03:50.730> to<00:03:50.820> a

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
this is advice I give I've given to a

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.199 
this is advice I give I've given to a
lot<00:03:51.030> of<00:03:51.150> my<00:03:51.239> students<00:03:51.600> cuz<00:03:51.780> it's<00:03:52.110> just<00:03:52.290> a<00:03:52.530> psych

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
lot of my students cuz it's just a psych

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.729 
lot of my students cuz it's just a psych
psychological<00:03:54.260> pattern<00:03:55.260> I've<00:03:55.380> recognized

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
psychological pattern I've recognized

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.440 
psychological pattern I've recognized
over<00:03:55.890> time<00:03:56.160> where<00:03:56.370> someone<00:03:56.580> calculates<00:03:57.209> a

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
over time where someone calculates a

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.690 
over time where someone calculates a
specific<00:03:58.230> way<00:03:58.410> or<00:03:58.709> maybe<00:03:58.950> when<00:03:59.160> they<00:03:59.310> started

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
specific way or maybe when they started

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.250 
specific way or maybe when they started
the<00:03:59.820> home<00:03:59.970> of<00:04:00.209> the<00:04:00.299> whole<00:04:00.420> combination<00:04:00.720> they

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
the home of the whole combination they

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.449 
the home of the whole combination they
thought<00:04:01.560> there<00:04:01.739> was<00:04:01.860> gonna<00:04:01.980> be<00:04:02.070> a<00:04:02.190> specific

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
thought there was gonna be a specific

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.009 
thought there was gonna be a specific
way<00:04:02.910> they<00:04:03.090> were<00:04:03.150> gonna<00:04:03.360> take<00:04:03.570> advantage<00:04:03.750> of

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
way they were gonna take advantage of

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:05.960 
way they were gonna take advantage of
the<00:04:04.080> king<00:04:04.290> like<00:04:04.530> the<00:04:04.709> back<00:04:04.860> rank<00:04:05.190> or<00:04:05.670> like<00:04:05.940> a

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
the king like the back rank or like a

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.699 
the king like the back rank or like a
weak<00:04:06.299> square<00:04:06.630> or<00:04:06.810> weak<00:04:07.080> dark<00:04:07.320> squares<00:04:07.590> or

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
weak square or weak dark squares or

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.199 
weak square or weak dark squares or
something<00:04:08.310> like<00:04:08.459> you<00:04:08.610> start<00:04:08.850> a<00:04:08.910> combination

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
something like you start a combination

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:10.759 
something like you start a combination
recognizing<00:04:10.049> that<00:04:10.140> there's<00:04:10.350> a<00:04:10.380> problem<00:04:10.620> in

00:04:10.759 --> 00:04:10.769 
recognizing that there's a problem in

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:12.259 
recognizing that there's a problem in
your<00:04:10.890> opponent's<00:04:11.220> camp<00:04:11.430> and<00:04:11.670> then<00:04:12.090> when<00:04:12.209> that

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
your opponent's camp and then when that

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.210 
your opponent's camp and then when that
doesn't<00:04:12.510> work<00:04:12.630> out<00:04:12.959> it's<00:04:13.590> very<00:04:13.680> easy<00:04:14.040> to

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
doesn't work out it's very easy to

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.240 
doesn't work out it's very easy to
either<00:04:14.370> give<00:04:14.730> up<00:04:14.940> or<00:04:15.260> to<00:04:16.260> go<00:04:16.560> crazy<00:04:16.859> and<00:04:17.160> then

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
either give up or to go crazy and then

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.890 
either give up or to go crazy and then
start<00:04:17.430> stacking<00:04:17.790> pieces<00:04:17.910> right<00:04:18.299> but<00:04:18.780> if

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
start stacking pieces right but if

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.210 
start stacking pieces right but if
you've<00:04:19.020> if<00:04:19.229> you've<00:04:19.380> actually<00:04:19.530> developed<00:04:20.130> your

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
you've if you've actually developed your

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.800 
you've if you've actually developed your
attack<00:04:20.549> with<00:04:20.820> a<00:04:20.849> good<00:04:21.180> strategical

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
attack with a good strategical

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.089 
attack with a good strategical
foundation<00:04:22.380> meaning<00:04:22.710> you<00:04:22.800> weren't<00:04:23.010> just

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:23.099 
foundation meaning you weren't just

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:24.150 
foundation meaning you weren't just
throwing<00:04:23.430> caution<00:04:23.610> to<00:04:23.820> the

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
throwing caution to the

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.830 
throwing caution to the
to<00:04:24.250> begin<00:04:24.370> with<00:04:24.640> then<00:04:25.060> probably<00:04:25.510> you're<00:04:25.690> like

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
to begin with then probably you're like

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.240 
to begin with then probably you're like
a<00:04:25.870> shark<00:04:26.230> and<00:04:26.440> there's<00:04:26.620> you<00:04:26.800> know<00:04:26.830> you're

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
a shark and there's you know you're

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:28.890 
a shark and there's you know you're
smelling<00:04:27.550> blood<00:04:27.820> in<00:04:27.940> the<00:04:28.030> water<00:04:28.090> for<00:04:28.480> a<00:04:28.540> reason

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
smelling blood in the water for a reason

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.780 
smelling blood in the water for a reason
so<00:04:29.110> one<00:04:29.890> of<00:04:29.950> the<00:04:30.040> biggest<00:04:30.280> mistakes<00:04:30.550> you<00:04:30.610> can

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
so one of the biggest mistakes you can

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.310 
so one of the biggest mistakes you can
make<00:04:30.820> is<00:04:31.090> being<00:04:31.240> stubborn<00:04:31.630> on<00:04:31.930> the<00:04:32.080> way<00:04:32.260> you

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
make is being stubborn on the way you

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.360 
make is being stubborn on the way you
want<00:04:32.590> to<00:04:32.710> win<00:04:32.890> the<00:04:32.980> game

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
want to win the game

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:34.680 
want to win the game
don't<00:04:33.610> give<00:04:33.790> up<00:04:33.940> on<00:04:34.060> a<00:04:34.120> mating<00:04:34.450> net<00:04:34.570> just

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
don't give up on a mating net just

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.180 
don't give up on a mating net just
because<00:04:34.990> the<00:04:35.110> back<00:04:35.290> rank<00:04:35.530> idea<00:04:35.830> didn't<00:04:36.130> work

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
because the back rank idea didn't work

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.700 
because the back rank idea didn't work
that's<00:04:36.940> my<00:04:37.090> point<00:04:37.300> so<00:04:37.510> it's<00:04:37.660> actually<00:04:38.080> um<00:04:38.320> a

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
that's my point so it's actually um a

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.160 
that's my point so it's actually um a
good<00:04:39.220> lesson<00:04:39.490> that<00:04:39.880> you<00:04:40.330> kind<00:04:40.540> of<00:04:40.630> see<00:04:40.870> how<00:04:41.140> I

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.170 
good lesson that you kind of see how I

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:42.960 
good lesson that you kind of see how I
didn't<00:04:41.620> see<00:04:41.650> the<00:04:41.890> right<00:04:42.040> idea<00:04:42.280> right<00:04:42.460> away<00:04:42.550> and

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:42.970 
didn't see the right idea right away and

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.030 
didn't see the right idea right away and
this<00:04:43.120> one<00:04:43.300> for<00:04:43.570> whatever<00:04:43.780> reason<00:04:44.290> and<00:04:44.410> I<00:04:44.560> went

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
this one for whatever reason and I went

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.320 
this one for whatever reason and I went
strategically<00:04:45.760> looking<00:04:46.060> for<00:04:46.210> other

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
strategically looking for other

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.850 
strategically looking for other
weaknesses<00:04:46.600> and<00:04:46.990> came<00:04:47.170> full<00:04:47.320> circle<00:04:47.380> to

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
weaknesses and came full circle to

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.550 
weaknesses and came full circle to
realize<00:04:48.160> that<00:04:48.430> there<00:04:49.000> was<00:04:49.150> maybe<00:04:49.330> ways<00:04:50.110> to<00:04:50.350> use

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
realize that there was maybe ways to use

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.320 
realize that there was maybe ways to use
the<00:04:50.740> back<00:04:50.920> rank<00:04:51.220> and<00:04:51.460> to<00:04:51.610> use<00:04:51.820> the<00:04:52.000> threats<00:04:52.210> of

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
the back rank and to use the threats of

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.480 
the back rank and to use the threats of
95<00:04:52.750> but<00:04:53.020> in<00:04:53.110> a<00:04:53.170> different<00:04:53.350> way<00:04:53.560> than<00:04:54.280> I<00:04:54.370> had

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
95 but in a different way than I had

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.340 
95 but in a different way than I had
first<00:04:54.700> considered<00:04:55.330> right<00:04:55.540> and<00:04:55.570> so<00:04:55.960> don't<00:04:56.200> be

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
first considered right and so don't be

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.110 
first considered right and so don't be
stubborn<00:04:56.590> consider<00:04:57.340> your<00:04:57.520> options<00:04:57.550> and

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
stubborn consider your options and

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.360 
stubborn consider your options and
you'll<00:04:58.660> be<00:04:58.780> better<00:04:58.900> for<00:04:59.140> it<00:04:59.260> so<00:04:59.620> let's<00:05:00.250> see
