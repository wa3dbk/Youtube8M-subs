00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.050
 [Music] 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:13.080
 why everyone I hope they 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:14.789
 were doing well then today 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.760
 this little video to introduce you 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:19.859
 this look that I called babydoll all 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.750
 just babydoll because I did 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.310
 an eyeliner 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.990
 there is a big multiple 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.590
 60's and that I used 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.960
 only powdery pink or very 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.350
 slightly sum one would like as well as 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.879
 an aqua cream that is pink like pink 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.379
 a little bit of powder is added 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:39.260
 join everything and how did I do that look 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:42.379
 and then I tell you to do everything 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:45.089
 so first of all I applied a 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.379
 base we can call it a base that 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:48.589
 comes on but like forever that is 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.929
 an acronym addict who is dragee pink 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:54.479
 iridescent allure I put on all my 

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:56.729
 eyelid the red seal lower than 6 and 

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:58.469
 then a little bit I stretched as 

00:00:56.729 --> 00:01:01.530
 usually to the temples and I have 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.909
 added a tip position on lost of 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:04.949
 my dull skin to shine a whole 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:06.960
 a little bit later on the headlights 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.140
 I took a salmon lighthouse actually I 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.800
 painted salmon dish the same that goes 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.000
 practically up to the eyebrows 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.100
 you will see learned I added a 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.220
 little bit of red 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.990
 and then I like to add a little 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.120
 light touch I put a rose hyper 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:27.120
 hyper hyper clear and iridescent actually 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:31.410
 under the eyebrow so here is for the game 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:34.340
 lighthouses and then for like that was 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.530
 really a people still has to 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:40.009
 create a relief actually I used a 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.829
 dark past rate to mark the fold of 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:45.140
 my eyelid 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:48.049
 to give a little bit of 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.539
 Relief and life to this flagship game 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:52.340
 is relatively simple 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:56.299
 then I drew a line of liner 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:59.000
 with my dear drama you can 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:00.799
 totally do that with something other than 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.380
 at least you can totally take 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:06.289
 navy blue or anthracite gray by 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.869
 example or even brown you can 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:12.110
 totally do it with a pencil with 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.910
 a lighthouse I still believe what does 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.269
 does the baby doll mind that's really 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:20.810
 the liner that is dark that slices with 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:23.569
 the eyelid quiero tender pink salmon in 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.760
 done but as long as you have the 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:28.040
 comma actually I think it will go and 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.560
 then it's true that if you do that 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.599
 with a pencil for example in principle 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.060
 it will be much better if for example 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:36.680
 your job 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.290
 the makeup is a little bit abrupt 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.359
 rice or what so you can totally 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.609
 adapted the color and the material for the 

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:45.799
 liner just think about doing it anyway 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:47.299
 a big comma so and then see in 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.970
 did I a little bit lengthened the 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:51.590
 very superior to art is currency 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.349
 to enlarge a little bit of it 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.970
 then you put some mascara and 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:57.950
 to do the eyebrows I used 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.910
 usually I actually use a liner 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.560
 cream that is very soft and gives a 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.860
 melted pretty cool but it's still 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.080
 very marked and 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.730
 right now I'm trying to put ass of 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.810
 lighthouse history to do something 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.600
 more natural 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.940
 very applied that with a small brush 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.140
 very short hair very well dense in 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:22.030
 does that allows to properly apply the 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.610
 matter without comment without that 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.590
 overflowing with too much but at the same time like 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:30.400
 it is not riquiqui it allows to have a 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.810
 trait that is clear but not 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.340
 completely stopped for precisely 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.260
 keep this spirit nature 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.780
 So here and see the work head 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.670
 to do is really super super simple 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:42.310
 I think even the girl who starts 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.050
 can succeed then I did my 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.450
 comma to the liner if you ever are a 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.739
 little bit that you do not dare or that 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.850
 you still have not really 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.709
 the habit of the liner you can 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.140
 totally take a cream liner 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.450
 it will be much softer or 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.640
 outright do with an end have put a 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:58.320
 little bit and it will be much more 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.820
 easy 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.260
 you can do with a pencil too 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.450
 to stop them a little bit because 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.890
 it's true that if we blur the blow 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.209
 allows us if we made a mistake in 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:09.190
 to hide it a little bit so 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:12.120
 when we start it's really a 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:14.620
 good technique I find 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.780
 that's it for that and then for the red to 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.510
 lips as I have not shown you I 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.400
 used lipstick at number 3 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.919
 who presents himself as that which is good 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.690
 site and cosmic djendji the site is 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:28.540
 currently in the process of maintenance 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.160
 so you can not access it so if 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.479
 you're interested to see go 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.030
 see in two weeks of three 

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:36.430
 weeks I think it will be over and by 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:39.510
 above to shine I put the 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:41.950
 gloss number 105 pink cashmere 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.229
 parked game but born from maybelline 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:47.290
 anyway called color 

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:47.960
 sensational so that's see it's 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.690
 really 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:53.660
 for once a little discreet look for 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:56.030
 true discreet I hope he will have you 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.800
 I make you all full 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.400
 full of kisses and then I you 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.960
 see you soon 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.960
 not bad tome 1 1
