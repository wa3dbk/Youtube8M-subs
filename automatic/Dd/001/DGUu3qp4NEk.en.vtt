that's<00:01:51.390> just<00:01:51.600> great<00:01:52.069> that's<00:01:53.069> far<00:01:53.399> more

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:53.429 
that's just great that's far more

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
get injured in VR do you every year a

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.309 
get injured in VR do you every year a

there's pain sensation in VR and even a
sense<00:02:04.440> of<00:02:04.500> reality<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:05.159> urgency<00:02:05.580> the<00:02:06.030> only

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
sense of reality and urgency the only

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.309 
sense of reality and urgency the only
difference<00:02:06.539> is<00:02:06.780> it<00:02:06.959> isn't<00:02:07.200> actually

00:02:07.309 --> 00:02:07.319 
difference is it isn't actually

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:09.109 
difference is it isn't actually
happening<00:02:07.530> that's<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.489> way<00:02:08.610> they<00:02:08.759> want<00:02:08.970> you
