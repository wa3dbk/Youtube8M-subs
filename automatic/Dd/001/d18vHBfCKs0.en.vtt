00:00:06.493 --> 00:00:08.080
 An enduring myth says that we use so 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.912
 only 10% of our brain. 

00:00:09.912 --> 00:00:13.501
 the other 90% remains idle, available as a reservation. 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.423
 Mercanchifles promise to unlock that hidden potential. 

00:00:16.423 --> 00:00:19.506
 with methods "based on neuroscience," 

00:00:19.507 --> 00:00:22.225
 But what they really unlock is your wallet. 

00:00:22.225 --> 00:00:23.474
 Two thirds of the population 

00:00:23.474 --> 00:00:25.309
 and almost half of the science teachers 

00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:27.859
 wrongly believe in the myth of 10%. 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:30.058
 in the 1890s, William James, 

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:32.058
 The father of American psychology, 

00:00:32.058 --> 00:00:33.942
 said, "Most of us do not know 

00:00:33.942 --> 00:00:35.692
 our mental potential. " 

00:00:35.692 --> 00:00:37.360
 James raised this as a challenge, 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.825
 not as a criticism of the brain's disuse. 

00:00:39.826 --> 00:00:41.734
 But a misunderstanding was created. 

00:00:41.734 --> 00:00:43.680
 In addition, the scientists could not determine 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.246
 for a long time 

00:00:45.246 --> 00:00:47.576
 the purpose of our huge frontal lobes 

00:00:47.576 --> 00:00:50.162
 or of large areas of the parietal lobe. 

00:00:50.162 --> 00:00:53.080
 Brain damage did not cause motor or sensory deficits, 

00:00:53.081 --> 00:00:56.539
 so the authorities concluded that they were not doing anything. 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:58.259
 for decades, these areas 

00:00:58.259 --> 00:01:00.204
 they were called as silent zones, 

00:01:00.204 --> 00:01:01.205
 his functions were elusive. 

00:01:01.206 --> 00:01:03.013
 We have now understood that they emphasize 

00:01:03.012 --> 00:01:04.968
 executive and integrative capacities, 

00:01:04.968 --> 00:01:07.222
 without which, we would hardly be human. 

00:01:07.222 --> 00:01:09.263
 They are crucial for abstract reasoning, 

00:01:09.263 --> 00:01:09.974
 the planning, 

00:01:09.974 --> 00:01:10.808
 the decision making 

00:01:10.808 --> 00:01:13.685
 and the flexibility to adapt to the circumstances. 

00:01:13.685 --> 00:01:15.524
 The idea that 9/10 parts of our brain 

00:01:15.524 --> 00:01:17.334
 they are inactive 

00:01:17.334 --> 00:01:20.942
 It is unfounded when we calculate how the brain uses energy. 

00:01:20.941 --> 00:01:23.152
 The brains of rodents and dogs consume 

00:01:23.153 --> 00:01:25.448
 5% of the total body energy. 

00:01:25.447 --> 00:01:27.583
 The brains of monkeys use 10%. 

00:01:27.584 --> 00:01:29.120
 The brain of an adult, 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.832
 which represents only 2% of body mass, 

00:01:31.831 --> 00:01:35.792
 consumes 20% of the metabolized daily glucose. 

00:01:35.793 --> 00:01:38.250
 in children, that figure is 50%, 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.881
 and in 60% babies. 

00:01:40.881 --> 00:01:42.418
 This is much more than expected 

00:01:42.418 --> 00:01:44.218
 for the relative size our brains, 

00:01:44.218 --> 00:01:46.636
 in scale to the proportion of the body size. 

00:01:46.635 --> 00:01:48.917
 The one of humans weighs 1.5 kilograms, 

00:01:48.917 --> 00:01:50.640
 The brain of elephants 5 kg, 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.750
 and the brain of the whales 9 kg, 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.667
 however, in relation to the weight, 

00:01:54.667 --> 00:01:56.519
 that of humans contains more neurons 

00:01:56.519 --> 00:01:58.397
 than any other species. 

00:01:58.397 --> 00:02:01.526
 This greater density is what makes us smarter. 

00:02:01.525 --> 00:02:03.567
 There is a trade-off between body size 

00:02:03.567 --> 00:02:05.614
 and the number of neurons of a primate, 

00:02:05.614 --> 00:02:07.426
 including us, can sustain. 

00:02:07.426 --> 00:02:10.304
 A 25 kg monkey has to eat 8 hours a day 

00:02:10.304 --> 00:02:14.760
 to maintain a brain with 53 billion neurons. 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.016
 The invention of cooking, 

00:02:16.016 --> 00:02:17.375
 one and a half million years ago, 

00:02:17.375 --> 00:02:19.342
 It gave us a great advantage. 

00:02:19.342 --> 00:02:22.359
 Cooked foods are soft and pre-digested 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.867
 outside the body. 

00:02:23.866 --> 00:02:26.465
 our digestive system absorbs its energy more easily. 

00:02:26.466 --> 00:02:27.927
 Cooking frees time 

00:02:27.927 --> 00:02:29.176
 and it provides more energy 

00:02:29.176 --> 00:02:31.131
 than eating raw foods 

00:02:31.131 --> 00:02:33.259
 and so we can hold our brains 

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:35.966
 with a density of 86 billion neurons. 

00:02:35.967 --> 00:02:38.604
 40% more than the monkey. 

00:02:38.604 --> 00:02:39.858
 Is that how it works: 

00:02:39.858 --> 00:02:41.733
 Half of the calories that the brain metabolizes 

00:02:41.733 --> 00:02:43.533
 are basically to keep your structure intact 

00:02:43.532 --> 00:02:46.831
 by pumping sodium and potassium ions 

00:02:46.831 --> 00:02:50.153
 through membranes to maintain an electrical charge. 

00:02:50.153 --> 00:02:53.201
 For this, the brain has to be an energy pig. 

00:02:53.201 --> 00:03:00.381
 It consumes the astounding amount of 3.4 x 10 ^ 21 ATP molecules per minute, 

00:03:00.381 --> 00:03:03.500
 ATPs are the coals of the body's furnace. 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.923
 The high cost of maintaining resting potentials 

00:03:05.954 --> 00:03:08.218
 of the 86 billion neurons 

00:03:08.217 --> 00:03:09.998
 means that little energy remains 

00:03:09.998 --> 00:03:13.582
 to drive the signals from the axons and the synapses, 

00:03:13.582 --> 00:03:16.353
 for the nervous discharges that are actually made. 

00:03:16.368 --> 00:03:19.312
 Although only a small percentage of the neurons 

00:03:19.312 --> 00:03:22.176
 are lit in a given region at a given time, 

00:03:22.176 --> 00:03:24.775
 the energy load of the action potentials 

00:03:24.776 --> 00:03:26.145
 over the entire brain simultaneously 

00:03:26.145 --> 00:03:27.979
 They would be unsustainable. 

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:30.531
 This is where energy efficiency comes into play. 

00:03:30.531 --> 00:03:32.895
 Let only a small proportion of cells 

00:03:32.895 --> 00:03:34.895
 send signals at a certain time, 

00:03:34.895 --> 00:03:36.812
 known as "isolated coding", 

00:03:36.812 --> 00:03:38.372
 which uses the least amount of energy, 

00:03:38.372 --> 00:03:40.666
 but it transmits the greatest amount of information. 

00:03:40.665 --> 00:03:42.918
 Because a small number of signals 

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:44.730
 they have thousands of possible paths 

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:46.979
 by which to distribute. 

00:03:46.979 --> 00:03:48.459
 A drawback of isolated coding 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.175
 within a large number of neurons 

00:03:50.175 --> 00:03:51.551
 it's your cost 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.178
 Worse yet, if a large proportion of cells never fire, 

00:03:54.179 --> 00:03:55.598
 then they become unnecessary 

00:03:55.598 --> 00:03:58.834
 and evolution should have eliminated them a long time ago. 

00:03:58.834 --> 00:04:00.402
 The solution is to find 

00:04:00.402 --> 00:04:02.344
 the optimal proportion of cells 

00:04:02.344 --> 00:04:04.395
 that the brain can have active constantly. 

00:04:04.395 --> 00:04:06.009
 To maximize efficiency, 

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:08.651
 between 1% and 16% of the cells 

00:04:08.651 --> 00:04:11.262
 They can be active at a certain time. 

00:04:11.263 --> 00:04:12.709
 This is the limit of energy 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:13.848
 what we have to live with 

00:04:13.848 --> 00:04:15.352
 In order to be aware at all. 

00:04:15.352 --> 00:04:16.959
 The need to conserve resources 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.290
 is the reason why most of the brain's operations 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.721
 It must occur outside of consciousness. 

00:04:21.721 --> 00:04:24.192
 That is why multitasking is a foolish hoax 

00:04:24.192 --> 00:04:26.971
 We just do not have the energy to do two things at once 

00:04:26.971 --> 00:04:28.783
 Not to mention three or five. 

00:04:28.783 --> 00:04:30.915
 Although we try, we are not able to do it, 

00:04:30.915 --> 00:04:33.242
 so let's use all our attention. 

00:04:33.242 --> 00:04:34.971
 The numbers are against us. 

00:04:34.971 --> 00:04:37.411
 Your brain is really intelligent and powerful. 

00:04:37.411 --> 00:04:39.721
 So powerful, it needs a lot of energy 

00:04:39.721 --> 00:04:41.054
 to stay powerful. 

00:04:41.053 --> 00:04:42.253
 And so smart 

00:04:42.254 --> 00:04:45.422
 that has been built on an energy efficiency plan. 

00:04:45.422 --> 00:04:47.009
 So do not let a fraudulent myth 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:48.508
 make you feel guilty for 

00:04:48.507 --> 00:04:49.822
 your supposedly lazy 

00:04:49.822 --> 00:04:51.762
 The fault would be a waste of energy. 

00:04:51.762 --> 00:04:52.637
 After all, 

00:04:52.637 --> 00:04:54.221
 Do not you realize that it's foolish to waste 

00:04:54.221 --> 00:04:55.305
 mental energy? 

00:04:55.305 --> 00:04:56.471
 You have millions of 

00:04:56.471 --> 00:04:58.103
 powerful and hungry neurons to maintain. 

00:04:58.103 --> 00:04:59.810
 So, hurry up!
