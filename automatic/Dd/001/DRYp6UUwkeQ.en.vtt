00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
freaking out speed this thing if we

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.490

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
could help speed this metric price would

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.830 
could help speed this metric price would
officially<00:02:04.770> be<00:02:04.950> general<00:02:05.399> status<00:02:05.610> I<00:02:05.880> know<00:02:06.540> I

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
officially be general status I know I

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.240 
officially be general status I know I
know<00:02:07.020> it's<00:02:07.200> been<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.350> long<00:02:07.560> time<00:02:07.770> coming<00:02:08.099> but<00:02:08.190> I

have<00:03:08.430> a<00:03:08.460> physical<00:03:08.850> move<00:03:09.000> that<00:03:09.180> could<00:03:09.330> have

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
have a physical move that could have

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.250 
have a physical move that could have
been<00:03:09.510> uh<00:03:09.630> that<00:03:10.500> could<00:03:10.620> have<00:03:10.740> been<00:03:10.800> nasty<00:03:12.260> this

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
been uh that could have been nasty this

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.200 
been uh that could have been nasty this
is<00:03:13.350> really<00:03:13.620> too<00:03:13.770> much<00:03:13.800> damage<00:03:14.340> but<00:03:14.550> I<00:03:14.820> don't

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
is really too much damage but I don't

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:16.730 
is really too much damage but I don't
know<00:03:15.300> what<00:03:15.390> mr.<00:03:15.480> krabs<00:03:15.810> defense<00:03:16.230> I'm<00:03:16.440> assuming

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
know what mr. krabs defense I'm assuming

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.430 
know what mr. krabs defense I'm assuming
it's<00:03:16.860> decent<00:03:17.550> but<00:03:17.700> not<00:03:17.850> great<00:03:18.210> because<00:03:19.020> I<00:03:19.050> he's

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
it's decent but not great because I he's

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.530 
it's decent but not great because I he's
got<00:03:19.620> very<00:03:19.860> good<00:03:19.950> attack<00:03:20.310> so<00:03:20.610> I'm<00:03:21.240> assuming

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
got very good attack so I'm assuming

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.720 
got very good attack so I'm assuming
most<00:03:21.840> of<00:03:22.050> his<00:03:22.200> stature<00:03:22.740> in<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.130> attack<00:03:23.460> one

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
most of his stature in the attack one

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.240 
most of his stature in the attack one
and<00:03:23.940> not<00:03:24.180> so<00:03:24.330> much<00:03:24.510> in<00:03:24.720> all<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.200> others<00:03:25.470> but

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
and not so much in all the others but

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.830 
and not so much in all the others but
yeah<00:03:26.520> the<00:03:26.640> flare<00:03:26.820> guns<00:03:27.030> down<00:03:27.270> let<00:03:27.540> them<00:03:27.690> take

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
yeah the flare guns down let them take

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.080 
yeah the flare guns down let them take
too<00:03:27.960> much<00:03:28.080> effort<00:03:28.140> there<00:03:28.650> you<00:03:28.800> go<00:03:28.980> there<00:03:29.940> you

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
too much effort there you go there you

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:31.520 
too much effort there you go there you
go<00:03:30.180> what<00:03:30.690> you<00:03:30.780> got<00:03:30.930> you're<00:03:31.080> gonna<00:03:31.170> send<00:03:31.410> in

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
go what you got you're gonna send in

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.920 
go what you got you're gonna send in
your<00:03:31.680> metric<00:03:32.490> the<00:03:32.670> SU<00:03:33.060> are<00:03:33.240> you<00:03:33.450> gonna<00:03:33.570> predict

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
your metric the SU are you gonna predict

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.600 
your metric the SU are you gonna predict
me<00:03:34.020> again<00:03:34.230> they're<00:03:34.980> not<00:03:35.010> gonna<00:03:35.190> protect<00:03:35.430> me

flamethrower<00:04:25.169> I<00:04:25.320> doubt<00:04:25.949> it<00:04:26.130> has<00:04:26.280> flamethrower

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
flamethrower I doubt it has flamethrower

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.689 
flamethrower I doubt it has flamethrower

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
actually not have any attacks that can

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.550 
actually not have any attacks that can
hit<00:04:33.120> me<00:04:33.240> that<00:04:33.389> would<00:04:33.479> be<00:04:33.509> funny<00:04:33.720> okay<00:04:33.990> let's

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
hit me that would be funny okay let's

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.180
