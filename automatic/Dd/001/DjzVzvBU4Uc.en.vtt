00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.340 
1870s my family and my father's
generation<00:00:32.239> was<00:00:33.239> involved<00:00:33.630> with<00:00:33.840> going<00:00:34.200> off

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
generation was involved with going off

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.370 
generation was involved with going off
the<00:00:34.559> planet<00:00:34.829> in<00:00:35.070> aircraft<00:00:35.870> and<00:00:36.870> less<00:00:37.079> than<00:00:37.260> a

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
the planet in aircraft and less than a

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.670 
the planet in aircraft and less than a
hundred<00:00:37.620> years<00:00:37.800> later<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:38.370> went<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.090> moon

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
hundred years later I went to the moon

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.380 
hundred years later I went to the moon
so<00:00:40.680> some<00:00:40.890> covered<00:00:41.250> wagons<00:00:41.700> are<00:00:41.879> going<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.300> the

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
so some covered wagons are going to the

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.529 
so some covered wagons are going to the
moon<00:00:42.629> in<00:00:42.960> less<00:00:43.739> than<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:43.980> hundred<00:00:44.340> years<00:00:44.670> is<00:00:45.090> a

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
moon in less than a hundred years is a

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.479 
moon in less than a hundred years is a
history<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.770> development<00:00:46.920> of<00:00:47.309> our

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
history of the development of our

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.040 
history of the development of our
civilization<00:00:48.530> in<00:00:49.530> not<00:00:50.520> our<00:00:50.789> lifetime<00:00:51.390> but<00:00:51.840> a

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
civilization in not our lifetime but a

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.189 
civilization in not our lifetime but a
couple<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.500> generations<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:53.579> so<00:00:54.449> it's<00:00:54.629> time

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
couple of generations and so it's time

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.090 
couple of generations and so it's time
to<00:00:55.350> start<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.739> thinking<00:00:56.190> in<00:00:56.399> those<00:00:56.850> terms<00:00:56.910> and

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
to start to thinking in those terms and

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.459 
to start to thinking in those terms and
particularly<00:00:59.100> since<00:00:59.370> now<00:00:59.879> in<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.870> 20th<00:01:01.289> and

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
particularly since now in the 20th and

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.399 
particularly since now in the 20th and
21st<00:01:01.500> century<00:01:02.430> we<00:01:03.090> suddenly<00:01:03.359> find<00:01:03.780> that<00:01:04.019> do<00:01:04.260> to

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
21st century we suddenly find that do to

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.270 
21st century we suddenly find that do to
our<00:01:04.439> expertise<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.810> our<00:01:06.810> genius<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.860> science

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
our expertise and our genius and science

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.080 
our expertise and our genius and science
and<00:01:08.430> technology<00:01:09.560> we<00:01:10.560> have<00:01:10.790> exploded<00:01:11.790> our

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
and technology we have exploded our

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.960 
and technology we have exploded our
population<00:01:12.869> from<00:01:13.260> under<00:01:13.619> two<00:01:13.799> billion<00:01:14.220> at<00:01:14.850> the

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
population from under two billion at the

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.060 
population from under two billion at the
beginning<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.540> 20th<00:01:15.930> century<00:01:16.290> there<00:01:16.950> were

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
beginning of the 20th century there were

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.730 
beginning of the 20th century there were
six<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.549> half<00:01:17.580> billion<00:01:18.000> at<00:01:18.240> this<00:01:18.420> point

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
six and a half billion at this point

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.380 
six and a half billion at this point
that<00:01:19.740> our<00:01:19.890> consumption<00:01:20.310> patterns<00:01:20.939> are

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
that our consumption patterns are

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.380 
that our consumption patterns are
clearly<00:01:21.720> indicating<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:23.310> we<00:01:23.520> are<00:01:23.700> utilizing

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
clearly indicating that we are utilizing

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.580 
clearly indicating that we are utilizing
our<00:01:24.990> non-renewable<00:01:25.830> resources<00:01:26.369> at<00:01:26.729> an

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
our non-renewable resources at an

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.429 
our non-renewable resources at an
unacceptable<00:01:28.590> rate<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:29.130> non-sustainable<00:01:29.790> ring

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
unacceptable rate a non-sustainable ring

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:33.200 
unacceptable rate a non-sustainable ring
so<00:01:31.439> we've<00:01:31.860> got<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.100> lot<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:32.400> thinking<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:32.939> be

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
so we've got a lot of thinking to be

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.580 
so we've got a lot of thinking to be
about<00:01:33.479> what<00:01:33.750> being<00:01:34.020> an<00:01:34.140> advanced

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
about what being an advanced

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.670 
about what being an advanced
civilization<00:01:35.150> really<00:01:36.150> means<00:01:36.390> but<00:01:37.259> let's<00:01:37.470> put

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
civilization really means but let's put

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.350 
civilization really means but let's put
all<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:37.979> aside<00:01:38.130> for<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.670> moment<00:01:38.790> because<00:01:39.240> it

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
all that aside for a moment because it

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.960 
all that aside for a moment because it
here<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.630> talk<00:01:39.810> about<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.110> solution<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:41.670> what

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
here to talk about the solution and what

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.080 
here to talk about the solution and what
I<00:01:42.000> am<00:01:42.150> suggesting<00:01:42.509> is<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.229> is<00:01:43.320> now<00:01:43.500> time<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:44.090> put

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
I am suggesting is it is now time to put

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.900 
I am suggesting is it is now time to put
away<00:01:45.890> this

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:50.910 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.180 

embargo<00:01:51.910> of<00:01:52.230> truth<00:01:53.230> about<00:01:53.710> the<00:01:53.830> alien

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
embargo of truth about the alien

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.730 
embargo of truth about the alien
presence<00:01:54.460> and<00:01:54.910> I<00:01:55.570> call<00:01:55.810> upon<00:01:55.840> our<00:01:56.110> government

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
presence and I call upon our government

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.510 
presence and I call upon our government
to<00:01:57.310> open<00:01:58.030> up<00:01:58.410> like<00:01:59.410> other<00:01:59.710> governments<00:02:00.310> have

change the Mexicans have all released

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.760 
change the Mexicans have all released
their<00:02:09.100> files<00:02:09.399> it's<00:02:10.390> about<00:02:10.660> time<00:02:10.960> now<00:02:11.350> that<00:02:11.650> we

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
their files it's about time now that we

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.190 
their files it's about time now that we
do<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:12.040> same<00:02:12.280> thing<00:02:12.610> and<00:02:12.910> become<00:02:13.660> a<00:02:13.690> part<00:02:14.110> of

do the same thing and become a part of

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.320 
do the same thing and become a part of
this<00:02:14.980> planetary<00:02:15.580> community<00:02:16.590> that<00:02:17.590> is<00:02:17.740> now

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
this planetary community that is now
