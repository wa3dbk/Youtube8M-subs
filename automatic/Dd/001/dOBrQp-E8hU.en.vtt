function number key that you want to use

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.990 
function number key that you want to use
for<00:00:34.590> example<00:00:34.680> if<00:00:35.130> you<00:00:35.219> want<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.460> refresh<00:00:35.700> on

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
to require you have to press the

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.840 
to require you have to press the
function<00:01:36.240> key<00:01:36.360> plus<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.500> f1<00:01:37.860> only<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.280> f12<00:01:38.670> to

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
function key plus the f1 only to f12 to

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.889 
function key plus the f1 only to f12 to
activate<00:01:39.329> action<00:01:39.720> keys<00:01:39.900> but<00:01:41.570> actually<00:01:42.570> I

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
activate action keys but actually I

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.499 
activate action keys but actually I
think<00:01:43.320> that's<00:01:43.590> backwards<00:01:43.799> it's<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.509> function

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
think that's backwards it's a function

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.200 
think that's backwards it's a function
key<00:01:45.689> key<00:01:46.110> plus<00:01:46.470> CF<00:01:46.770> 1<00:01:47.040> which<00:01:47.610> would<00:01:47.790> be<00:01:47.850> help

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
key key plus CF 1 which would be help

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.609 
key key plus CF 1 which would be help
button<00:01:48.570> or<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.409> function<00:01:49.740> key<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.790> f12<00:01:51.509> f2<00:01:52.110> for

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
button or the function key to f12 f2 for

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.319 
button or the function key to f12 f2 for
the<00:01:52.880> dimming<00:01:54.470> I<00:01:55.579> all<00:01:56.579> I<00:01:56.610> know<00:01:56.729> is<00:01:56.939> that<00:01:57.090> this<00:01:57.210> is

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
the dimming I all I know is that this is

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.999 
the dimming I all I know is that this is
the<00:01:57.450> way<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.600> do<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:57.869> so<00:01:58.159> we<00:01:59.159> just<00:01:59.189> press<00:01:59.640> R<00:01:59.969> to

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
the way to do it so we just press R to

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.249 
the way to do it so we just press R to
exit<00:02:02.009> just<00:02:02.189> press<00:02:02.549> f10<00:02:02.909> again<00:02:03.180> think<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:03.930> time

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
exit just press f10 again think of time

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.490 
exit just press f10 again think of time
then<00:02:04.829> here<00:02:05.100> you<00:02:05.219> just<00:02:05.280> go<00:02:05.490> say<00:02:05.700> yes<00:02:06.170> ok<00:02:07.170> then

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
then here you just go say yes ok then

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.210 
then here you just go say yes ok then
it's<00:02:07.590> going<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.740> be<00:02:07.829> turning<00:02:08.099> on<00:02:09.080> CD<00:02:10.080> 2<00:02:10.289> logo

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
it's going to be turning on CD 2 logo

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.690 
it's going to be turning on CD 2 logo
and<00:02:11.540> I<00:02:12.560> have<00:02:13.560> windows<00:02:13.950> in<00:02:14.070> the<00:02:14.130> wound<00:02:14.340> -<00:02:14.520> so

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
and I have windows in the wound - so

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.280 
and I have windows in the wound - so
that's<00:02:14.910> why<00:02:15.030> I<00:02:15.090> have<00:02:15.240> to<00:02:15.360> do<00:02:15.480> another<00:02:15.690> extra

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
that's why I have to do another extra

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.110 
that's why I have to do another extra
enter<00:02:16.620> you<00:02:17.220> would<00:02:17.340> just<00:02:17.490> normally<00:02:17.640> go

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
enter you would just normally go

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.630

normal<00:02:21.030> window<00:02:21.510> starting<00:02:21.930> okay<00:02:23.240> so<00:02:24.980> we<00:02:25.980> just

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
normal window starting okay so we just

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:35.839 
normal window starting okay so we just
