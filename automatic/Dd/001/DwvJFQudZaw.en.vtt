00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.470
 we want to enchant our won 

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:05.470
 with this soul 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.079
 Stand with the craft etc Long Gun Plus 

00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:13.059
 the goal is not just there 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:14.540
 +10 that's still possible 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.540
 so much can sales on 8 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.279
 myself, of course 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:24.070
 for a second it costs already 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.070
 a thousand 26 three acts 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:29.220
 and now 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.190
 if I do it now permanently 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:33.690
 51 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:34.749
 300 

00:00:34.749 --> 00:00:36.860
 62 wear 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.440
 These are great prices or 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.440
 get well 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.770
 too cold 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.400
 Taking honors with permanent enchant for crafting at all 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.480
 makes no sense 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.770
 you can also just go to the teacher 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.240
 that's cheaper, nothing more to say 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.240
 and then you have things permanently improved 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.970
 both move all going on 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.360
 but first I quote Meiningen 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.570
 because I dare to sleep in his bed 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.010
 until it is held 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.010
 which can take a very long time in the corpus disease 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.880
 something is here and feels that someone is nearby 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.560
 strongly 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.040
 to 4 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.830
 the scene could have become so epic or not 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.830
 he once again made a fool of himself 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.150
 look at me i can stand by one's own house and if no guest 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.030
 then I will not help them 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.030
 I want to be more neutral 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.900
 wash together 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.360
 please do not fall 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.580
 Buccaneer tenth time 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:01.600
 did you see his eyes? 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.430
 Manz sees quite well here 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.570
 Do you see that? 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.369
 the way 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.369
 ASC in anger the 

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:13.969
 also ill with cottbus 

00:02:13.969 --> 00:02:18.489
 and that is this blindness from the local spoke another effect of 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.459
 illness 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.459
 I think 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.580
 Corpus it really no longer wants to be ill with the man 

00:02:30.749 --> 00:02:33.479
 definitely not 

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:36.179
 Pothier where should I go now 

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:39.549
 where if I now ask Carlos' question about Kairos 

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:45.199
 you should go really red 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:48.099
 everyone can do that 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:51.019
 I always think the same when I see you 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.019
 I mean I should never really hit the wall 

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:57.589
 Saidi come 

00:02:57.589 --> 00:03:02.649
 in addition to orders there may be guest dead Stella 60 sixth house and his write none 

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:03.659
 Threat more 

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:07.609
 you have earned your promotion to the rank of traveler more 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:10.929
 «I am very worried because Lady Headdresses have illness 

00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:13.929
 but I have some good news on this matter 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:19.290
 I contacted my informants for possible treatment for Mörz 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.219
 the case that you get infected with the disease during your mission 

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:23.609
 to have 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:26.069
 from nimble finger abbey 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:29.289
 that they have the best chance of healing 

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:30.919
 which has 4 far 

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:35.429
 an old relative was the head of Rustavi for victims of this disease 

00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:37.999
 Umar i 

00:03:37.999 --> 00:03:41.959
 here take this topic had "fact" and a thousand sticking out and thought Hey 4 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.759
 the far 4 will like the artifact a present could appease him 

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:48.419
 the money is for expenses 

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:50.979
 and here are still a few liters of TSI and squeezed 

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:54.189
 you will need the Mantovani towers there looks striking stairs 

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:55.229
 use 

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:58.239
 So let go, cure your corpus disease 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.239
 then come back as soon as possible 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:05.019
 OK 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:09.179
 summarized is met by a man who calls himself the mollusk 

00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:12.929
 and in which we were even old calls 11 4 1 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:15.139
 or go 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:18.609
 around 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:20.439
 What do I want to do now 

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:22.809
 8 yes I became 

00:04:22.809 --> 00:04:26.699
 often asked what the index for it now and believe me if I 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:28.479
 tell you that we are 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:31.620
 after some time, inevitably turn to "fan" 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:38.309
 has at the neck Duda's panties 

00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:41.309
 that means 11 4 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.949
 said Kurer Marcel Gille 

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:47.949
 Jan 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:51.539
 not earned by you and we do not » 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.650
 Munich said Moron 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:04.789
 but what do I do if anything 

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:07.789
 I accept to let my corpus cure disease 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.430
 and not cool though 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.129
 because they did not run away 

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:20.159
 Motor world wonder Wolf Maahn okay 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:35.489
 the typical wc window scene that women have been willing to sell 

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:40.629
 Class one makes a window 

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:44.249
 Bruno is visible and lets the door out and then 

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:47.249
 you show it to somebody 

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:49.629
 and then it falls down 

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:52.629
 if you do not light the ground floor 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:56.830
 that the water 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.809
 absolutely 

00:05:58.809 --> 00:06:01.809
 where wood 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.259
 and I believe that chef Rosarium 

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:07.520
