and then for the staff of raw you need
to<00:00:34.380> build<00:00:35.309> him<00:00:35.700> at<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.239> last<00:00:36.600> boss<00:00:36.989> level<00:00:40.610> now

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
to build him at the last boss level now

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.819 
to build him at the last boss level now
for<00:00:41.820> this<00:00:41.910> level<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.300> need<00:00:42.420> to<00:00:42.680> build<00:00:43.680> the

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
for this level you need to build the

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.170 
for this level you need to build the
different<00:00:44.129> light<00:00:44.309> beams<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.870> different

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:47.180 
different light beams to the different

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.610 
different light beams to the different
reflection<00:00:48.180> panels<00:00:48.450> I<00:00:48.750> mean<00:00:48.930> bounce<00:00:49.440> the

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
reflection panels I mean bounce the

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.729 
reflection panels I mean bounce the
light<00:00:49.649> around<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.750> I<00:00:51.750> think<00:00:52.260> you're<00:00:52.440> supposed

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
light around and I think you're supposed

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.529 
light around and I think you're supposed
to<00:00:52.800> bounce<00:00:53.219> light<00:00:53.399> around<00:00:53.850> but<00:00:54.000> longer<00:00:54.390> way

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
to bounce light around but longer way

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.180 
to bounce light around but longer way
than<00:00:54.809> you<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:55.850> can<00:00:56.850> because<00:00:57.840> that<00:00:58.160> because<00:00:59.160> I

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
than you I can because that because I

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.380 
than you I can because that because I
think<00:00:59.520> we<00:00:59.840> get<00:01:00.840> like<00:01:01.770> build<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.430> think<00:01:02.879> five

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
think we get like build I think five

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.350 
think we get like build I think five
different<00:01:06.830> reflectors<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.909> really<00:01:09.240> only

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
different reflectors and you really only

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.679 
different reflectors and you really only
need<00:01:09.510> one<00:01:10.049> so<00:01:10.619> either<00:01:10.939> the<00:01:11.939> other<00:01:12.030> ones<00:01:12.360> do

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
need one so either the other ones do

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.080 
need one so either the other ones do
something<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.439> we<00:01:13.700> haven't<00:01:14.700> taken<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.060> time

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
something that we haven't taken the time

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.200 
something that we haven't taken the time
to<00:01:15.479> learn<00:01:15.630> or<00:01:16.110> there's<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.040> post<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.700> vessel<00:01:18.090> I

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
to learn or there's a post a vessel I

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.469 
to learn or there's a post a vessel I
thought<00:01:18.450> light<00:01:18.750> off<00:01:18.930> those<00:01:19.200> ones<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:20.479> you

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
thought light off those ones and you

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.980 
thought light off those ones and you
don't<00:01:21.659> need<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:23.150> so<00:01:24.150> anyway<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.689> different

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
don't need to so anyway the different

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.580 
don't need to so anyway the different
ones<00:01:25.110> that<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.320> just<00:01:25.409> see<00:01:25.770> laying<00:01:26.009> around

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
ones that you just see laying around

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:27.840 
ones that you just see laying around
you<00:01:26.679> don't<00:01:26.859> really<00:01:26.979> need<00:01:27.189> to<00:01:27.310> use<00:01:27.429> some<00:01:27.670> while

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
you don't really need to use some while

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.289 
you don't really need to use some while
you<00:01:27.939> need<00:01:28.090> it's<00:01:28.210> a<00:01:28.299> very<00:01:28.509> first<00:01:28.719> one<00:01:29.020> to

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
you need it's a very first one to

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.419 
you need it's a very first one to
activate<00:01:31.299> the<00:01:31.479> treasure<00:01:31.719> chest<00:01:32.049> and<00:01:32.429> those

00:01:33.419 --> 00:01:33.429 
activate the treasure chest and those

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:35.099 
activate the treasure chest and those
tables<00:01:33.939> aren't<00:01:34.179> here<00:01:34.390> that<00:01:34.570> the<00:01:34.689> club<00:01:34.899> does

00:01:35.099 --> 00:01:35.109 
tables aren't here that the club does

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:37.590 
tables aren't here that the club does
story<00:01:35.469> but<00:01:35.649> I<00:01:35.679> think<00:01:35.710> if<00:01:35.890> you<00:01:36.039> I<00:01:36.579> guess<00:01:37.299> a<00:01:37.329> guide

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
story but I think if you I guess a guide

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.440 
story but I think if you I guess a guide
-<00:01:37.750> studs<00:01:38.429> kind<00:01:39.429> of<00:01:39.549> depending<00:01:39.939> on<00:01:40.090> what<00:01:40.329> they

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
- studs kind of depending on what they

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.419 
- studs kind of depending on what they
give<00:01:40.600> you<00:01:42.179> yeah<00:01:43.179> so<00:01:43.780> anyway<00:01:44.079> I<00:01:44.409> just<00:01:44.619> stand<00:01:45.280> out

00:01:45.419 --> 00:01:45.429 
give you yeah so anyway I just stand out

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:48.059 
give you yeah so anyway I just stand out
here<00:01:45.759> and<00:01:45.819> shines<00:01:46.509> staff<00:01:47.289> of<00:01:47.500> light<00:01:47.709> over<00:01:48.039> here

00:01:48.059 --> 00:01:48.069 
here and shines staff of light over here

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:50.819 
here and shines staff of light over here
or<00:01:48.969> I<00:01:49.030> guess<00:01:49.240> gnarly<00:01:49.630> stuff<00:01:49.689> lights<00:01:50.140> shine<00:01:50.619> the

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:50.829 
or I guess gnarly stuff lights shine the

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:54.120 
or I guess gnarly stuff lights shine the
light<00:01:51.280> stuff<00:01:51.899> over<00:01:52.899> here<00:01:52.929> and<00:01:53.469> then<00:01:53.590> reflect

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
light stuff over here and then reflect

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:01.029 
light stuff over here and then reflect
the<00:01:54.250> light<00:01:54.399> this<00:01:54.609> way

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:01.039 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:08.350 

kind<00:02:01.610> of<00:02:01.700> take<00:02:01.880> a<00:02:01.909> guess<00:02:02.270> or<00:02:02.570> where<00:02:02.780> it'll<00:02:02.990> be

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.270 

I<00:02:08.390> want<00:02:08.930> to<00:02:09.050> see<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:09.320> light<00:02:09.530> kind<00:02:09.860> of<00:02:09.980> fix

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
I want to see the light kind of fix

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.920 
I want to see the light kind of fix
itself<00:02:10.790> then<00:02:11.090> you'll<00:02:11.300> know<00:02:11.420> it's<00:02:11.630> on<00:02:11.780> another

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
itself then you'll know it's on another

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.850 
itself then you'll know it's on another
reflector<00:02:13.900> like<00:02:14.900> right<00:02:15.110> there<00:02:15.320> you<00:02:15.560> can<00:02:15.680> guys

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
reflector like right there you can guys

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.280 
reflector like right there you can guys
see<00:02:16.040> how<00:02:16.100> it<00:02:16.220> just<00:02:16.250> in<00:02:16.610> itself<00:02:16.960> so<00:02:17.960> we<00:02:18.140> just

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
see how it just in itself so we just

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.020 
see how it just in itself so we just
gonna<00:02:18.410> own<00:02:18.620> that<00:02:18.650> reflector<00:02:19.280> and<00:02:19.610> then<00:02:19.850> we

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
gonna own that reflector and then we

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.360 
gonna own that reflector and then we
bounce<00:02:21.020> it<00:02:21.230> over<00:02:21.290> there<00:02:21.530> and<00:02:21.890> there's<00:02:22.220> the

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
bounce it over there and there's the

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.910 
bounce it over there and there's the
treasure<00:02:22.520> chest
