well for us this is certainly just this
is<00:02:16.750> a<00:02:16.780> one-off<00:02:17.020> thing<00:02:17.140> I<00:02:17.410> mean<00:02:17.560> for<00:02:17.890> this<00:02:18.040> fits

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
is a one-off thing I mean for this fits

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.520 
is a one-off thing I mean for this fits
right<00:02:18.580> into<00:02:18.820> the<00:02:19.090> halo<00:02:19.330> 2<00:02:19.600> 3<00:02:20.020> sort<00:02:20.350> of<00:02:20.410> in<00:02:20.500> the

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530

right into the halo 2 3 sort of in the
bungee<00:02:20.890> trilogy<00:02:21.370> I<00:02:21.550> mean<00:02:21.730> I<00:02:21.790> think<00:02:22.060> Halo<00:02:22.480> Wars

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
bungee trilogy I mean I think Halo Wars

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.120 
bungee trilogy I mean I think Halo Wars
just<00:02:23.170> indicative<00:02:23.440> of<00:02:23.710> how<00:02:23.830> broad<00:02:24.100> the

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
just indicative of how broad the

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.220 
just indicative of how broad the
universe's<00:02:24.790> and<00:02:25.090> there's<00:02:25.480> various<00:02:25.840> ways<00:02:26.020> to

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
universe's and there's various ways to

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.160 
universe's and there's various ways to
take<00:02:26.440> it<00:02:26.590> but<00:02:27.330> from<00:02:28.330> Bundy's<00:02:28.660> perspective

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
take it but from Bundy's perspective

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:31.530 
take it but from Bundy's perspective
this<00:02:29.320> is<00:02:29.530> just<00:02:30.100> us<00:02:30.280> adding<00:02:30.670> more<00:02:30.820> content<00:02:31.120> back

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
this is just us adding more content back

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.580 
this is just us adding more content back
to<00:02:31.600> people<00:02:31.990> that<00:02:32.170> are<00:02:32.290> currently<00:02:32.530> playing

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
to people that are currently playing

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.340 
to people that are currently playing
halo<00:02:33.010> 3<00:02:33.310> and<00:02:33.520> keeping<00:02:34.300> that<00:02:34.450> sort<00:02:34.870> of<00:02:34.900> trilogy

longer<00:02:36.700> this<00:02:37.510> kind<00:02:37.780> of<00:02:37.810> just<00:02:37.930> began<00:02:38.170> in

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
longer this kind of just began in

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.410 
longer this kind of just began in

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
some of some other projects but it just

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.570 
some of some other projects but it just
felt<00:02:56.530> like<00:02:56.620> something<00:02:56.830> that<00:02:57.010> we<00:02:57.070> kind<00:02:57.220> of<00:02:57.340> we

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
something different and test the waters

something different and test the waters
a<00:03:13.959> little<00:03:14.110> bit<00:03:14.380> and<00:03:14.590> take<00:03:14.950> some<00:03:15.160> risks<00:03:15.550> and

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840
