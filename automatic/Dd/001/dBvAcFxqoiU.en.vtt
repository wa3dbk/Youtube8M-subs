00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:07.350
 150 million years ago a creature called arcadio perinÃ©s raised very 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.579
 good 

00:00:09.579 --> 00:00:12.609
 this creature part apple part reptile had teeth 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:15.419
 solid bones 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:18.419
 Ricardo this reptile 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.869
 I had something more 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.869
 the archaic dear ones had pen 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.700
 feathers and flight improved for the next 75 million years 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.010
 birds lost customers and their bones were made public what 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.010
 reduced the weight and almost 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.360
 the flight of the birds could have evolved to flee from the 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.350
 predators 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.970
 to catch their prey or to move from one place to another more easily 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.920
 Nobody knows for sure 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.240
 but of something yes we can be week 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.240
 all 8,700 species of birds have feathers 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.590
 made of keratin the same hair protein 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.680
 the feathers evolved from the scales that had their ancestors the reptiles 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.070
 Once critical press has more than 7000 pens 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.730
 the feathers of small eagles 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.220
 that was telling you made to fly helps them stay in the air 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.010
 etc 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.010
 even birds that do not fly have feathers 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.840
 the penguins have more than 70 feathers pieces in a square inch 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.550
 vick 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.590
 their feathers protect them because they are waterproof that cover their layer of fat 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.590
 that isolates them 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.810
 the pens owe their colors to different pigments 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.380
 birds with black or brown gray plumage owe their color to melanin 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.140
 the crimson philis owe this color to carotene in shrimp and others 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.140
 crustaceans that are their food 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:17.599
 all the birds also play games 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.959
 but the nests range from the very simple 

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:27.059
 to the very elaborate 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:35.379
 the chicks of some birds the ducks for example are precocious capable of 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:38.379
 feed themselves as soon as they hatch 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:46.439
 Other birds like those of the albatross are alt beginnings and they have to wait for 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:49.439
 that his parents food 

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:54.849
 the search for food leads the birds to large annual migrations 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:59.900
 hummingbirds can fly hundreds of kilometers from places where 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.830
 They live in the state of Washington to the Mexican territory where the 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:04.599
 winter 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:07.729
 coming and going every year 

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:11.449
 This adaptive facility allows birds to find a 

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:13.759
 abode in almost any skill in the world
