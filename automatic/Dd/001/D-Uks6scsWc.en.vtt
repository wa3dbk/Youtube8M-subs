00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.920 
so as you could see my shoe box was too
long<00:02:23.370> and<00:02:23.610> when<00:02:23.730> I<00:02:23.760> added<00:02:24.120> another<00:02:24.420> piece<00:02:24.720> of

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
long and when I added another piece of

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.320 
long and when I added another piece of
blue<00:02:25.110> tape<00:02:25.140> it<00:02:25.620> wasn't<00:02:26.519> the<00:02:26.549> same<00:02:26.640> length<00:02:27.150> and

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
blue tape it wasn't the same length and

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.809 
blue tape it wasn't the same length and
it<00:02:27.450> didn't<00:02:27.690> look<00:02:27.720> right<00:02:27.840> so<00:02:28.319> I<00:02:28.560> just<00:02:29.250> cut<00:02:29.519> a

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
it didn't look right so I just cut a

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.960 
it didn't look right so I just cut a
line<00:02:30.269> along<00:02:30.750> word<00:02:31.110> this<00:02:31.650> piece<00:02:31.980> ended<00:02:32.400> off<00:02:32.610> and

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
line along word this piece ended off and

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.620 
line along word this piece ended off and
then<00:02:33.750> I<00:02:34.079> just<00:02:34.620> cut<00:02:35.040> off<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.459> two<00:02:35.819> sides<00:02:36.120> of<00:02:36.450> it

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
then I just cut off the two sides of it

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.880 
then I just cut off the two sides of it
as<00:02:36.780> well<00:02:37.319> and<00:02:37.590> what<00:02:38.220> I'm<00:02:38.400> gonna<00:02:38.670> do<00:02:38.970> is<00:02:39.000> just<00:02:39.890> on

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
shoe box that you can't really tell the

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.830 
shoe box that you can't really tell the
not<00:03:07.889> a<00:03:07.920> canvas<00:03:08.489> and<00:03:08.639> you<00:03:09.150> guys<00:03:09.329> could<00:03:09.540> go<00:03:09.720> ahead

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
not a canvas and you guys could go ahead

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.599 
not a canvas and you guys could go ahead
and<00:03:09.989> make<00:03:10.230> these<00:03:10.470> stars<00:03:10.859> that<00:03:11.130> I<00:03:11.190> taught<00:03:11.430> you

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
and make these stars that I taught you

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:14.479 
and make these stars that I taught you
my<00:03:11.790> other<00:03:12.000> tutorial<00:03:12.780> and<00:03:12.989> go<00:03:13.680> ahead<00:03:13.799> and<00:03:13.980> glue

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
my other tutorial and go ahead and glue

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.910 
my other tutorial and go ahead and glue
them<00:03:14.670> on<00:03:14.940> your<00:03:15.269> canvas<00:03:15.900> so<00:03:16.349> I<00:03:16.380> think<00:03:16.500> it<00:03:16.769> looks

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
them on your canvas so I think it looks

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.770 
them on your canvas so I think it looks
really<00:03:17.010> cool<00:03:17.549> when<00:03:18.030> you<00:03:18.150> put<00:03:18.299> it<00:03:18.420> on<00:03:18.510> the<00:03:18.630> walk

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
really cool when you put it on the walk

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.410 
really cool when you put it on the walk
is<00:03:18.989> it<00:03:19.139> a<00:03:19.230> pop<00:03:19.410> of<00:03:19.590> 3d<00:03:20.040> and<00:03:20.280> also<00:03:20.790> if<00:03:21.090> you<00:03:21.209> guys

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
is it a pop of 3d and also if you guys

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.449 
is it a pop of 3d and also if you guys
don't<00:03:21.660> like<00:03:21.900> that<00:03:22.290> you<00:03:22.500> could<00:03:22.680> just<00:03:22.739> use<00:03:23.130> duct

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
don't like that you could just use duct

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.229 
don't like that you could just use duct
tape<00:03:23.549> and<00:03:24.019> cut<00:03:25.019> out<00:03:25.169> words<00:03:25.709> and<00:03:26.220> phrases<00:03:26.549> and

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
tape and cut out words and phrases and

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.659 
tape and cut out words and phrases and
like<00:03:27.630> put<00:03:28.049> that<00:03:28.200> on<00:03:28.349> your<00:03:28.500> thingy<00:03:28.889> to<00:03:29.280> on<00:03:29.489> your

like put that on your thingy to on your
canvas<00:03:29.880> you<00:03:30.660> could<00:03:30.840> just<00:03:30.870> print<00:03:31.290> out<00:03:31.500> text

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370
