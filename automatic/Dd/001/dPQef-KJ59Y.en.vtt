raise the lens in relation to the back

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.129 
raise the lens in relation to the back
of<00:01:09.460> the<00:01:09.520> camera<00:01:09.729> where<00:01:10.240> the<00:01:10.389> image<00:01:10.600> is<00:01:10.899> going

00:01:11.129 --> 00:01:11.139 
of the camera where the image is going

00:01:11.139 --> 00:01:13.529 
of the camera where the image is going
to<00:01:11.200> be<00:01:11.289> focused<00:01:11.709> so<00:01:12.520> when<00:01:12.999> you<00:01:13.090> tilt<00:01:13.359> the<00:01:13.509> lens

00:01:13.529 --> 00:01:13.539 
to be focused so when you tilt the lens

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:15.599 
to be focused so when you tilt the lens
you're<00:01:14.229> pointing<00:01:14.770> it<00:01:14.920> at<00:01:15.100> a<00:01:15.159> slightly

00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:15.609 
you're pointing it at a slightly

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:17.760 
you're pointing it at a slightly
different<00:01:15.969> angle<00:01:16.630> from<00:01:16.899> the<00:01:17.049> normal<00:01:17.380> straight

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
different angle from the normal straight

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.160 
different angle from the normal straight
head-on<00:01:18.579> approach<00:01:18.999> and<00:01:19.299> then<00:01:19.749> when<00:01:19.869> you<00:01:19.929> shift

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
head-on approach and then when you shift

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.050 
head-on approach and then when you shift
the<00:01:20.350> lens<00:01:20.560> you're<00:01:21.069> moving<00:01:21.369> it<00:01:21.490> upwards<00:01:21.700> or

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
the lens you're moving it upwards or

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.109 
the lens you're moving it upwards or
downwards<00:01:22.090> to<00:01:22.659> achieve<00:01:22.959> the<00:01:23.109> desired<00:01:23.409> effect

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
downwards to achieve the desired effect

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.489 
downwards to achieve the desired effect
so<00:01:25.119> to<00:01:25.179> do<00:01:25.450> till<00:01:25.719> ship<00:01:25.929> photography<00:01:26.350> these

00:01:26.489 --> 00:01:26.499 
so to do till ship photography these

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:28.169 
so to do till ship photography these
days<00:01:26.679> you<00:01:26.859> need<00:01:27.009> to<00:01:27.130> get<00:01:27.279> a<00:01:27.459> special<00:01:27.700> tilt

00:01:28.169 --> 00:01:28.179 
days you need to get a special tilt

this<00:02:21.110> effect<00:02:22.270> now<00:02:23.270> while<00:02:23.510> I<00:02:23.540> didn't<00:02:24.080> get<00:02:24.350> a

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
this effect now while I didn't get a

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.420 
this effect now while I didn't get a
real<00:02:25.810> tilt<00:02:26.810> shift<00:02:26.900> II<00:02:27.380> kind<00:02:27.739> of<00:02:27.830> look<00:02:28.040> with

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
real tilt shift II kind of look with

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.640 
real tilt shift II kind of look with
this<00:02:28.610> technique<00:02:28.970> what<00:02:29.720> I<00:02:29.750> did<00:02:30.080> get<00:02:30.260> was<00:02:30.470> some

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
this technique what I did get was some

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:37.059 
this technique what I did get was some
really<00:02:30.800> interesting<00:02:31.070> light<00:02:31.610> leaks

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:38.530 

from<00:02:37.670> some<00:02:37.849> of<00:02:37.879> the<00:02:38.000> people<00:02:38.239> that<00:02:38.329> I<00:02:38.420> had

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
to practice you almost have to hinge the

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.470 
to practice you almost have to hinge the
lens<00:02:45.469> on<00:02:45.799> your<00:02:46.069> finger<00:02:46.489> and<00:02:46.670> move<00:02:47.269> it<00:02:47.390> around

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:51.109 
ever so slightly but when I did it

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:54.280 
ever so slightly but when I did it
I<00:02:51.280> didn't<00:02:52.280> ever<00:02:52.489> see<00:02:52.909> the<00:02:53.120> real<00:02:53.420> hard<00:02:54.049> core

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
I didn't ever see the real hard core

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.229 
I didn't ever see the real hard core
tilt<00:02:54.590> shift<00:02:54.650> effect<00:02:55.010> but<00:02:55.700> I<00:02:55.730> was<00:02:55.879> looking<00:02:56.090> for

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
tilt shift effect but I was looking for

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.390 
tilt shift effect but I was looking for
but<00:02:56.629> what<00:02:56.750> I<00:02:56.780> did<00:02:57.079> end<00:02:57.379> up<00:02:57.500> with<00:02:57.829> was<00:02:58.189> some

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
those are your depth of field so the

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.780 
those are your depth of field so the
thinner<00:05:11.169> that<00:05:11.380> you<00:05:11.560> make<00:05:11.740> it<00:05:11.919> the<00:05:12.340> shallower

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.370 
of field is gonna be so I'm just gonna
shadow<00:05:20.710> it<00:05:21.010> up<00:05:21.160> here<00:05:21.460> a<00:05:21.490> little<00:05:21.880> bit<00:05:22.030> and<00:05:22.479> these

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:29.890 
depth of field so I'm just going to

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:32.550 
depth of field so I'm just going to
spread<00:05:30.130> that<00:05:30.310> just<00:05:30.580> a<00:05:30.760> little<00:05:31.060> bit<00:05:31.229> and<00:05:32.229> then

and what I want to do is I just want to
increase<00:05:45.850> my<00:05:46.060> saturation<00:05:46.330> a<00:05:46.840> little<00:05:46.870> bit

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090 
increase my saturation a little bit

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.040 
increase my saturation a little bit
because<00:05:49.090> when<00:05:49.240> you<00:05:49.330> increase<00:05:49.630> the<00:05:49.840> saturation

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
because when you increase the saturation

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.340 
because when you increase the saturation
some<00:05:50.940> it<00:05:51.940> just<00:05:52.180> sort<00:05:52.360> of<00:05:52.419> makes<00:05:52.600> it<00:05:52.690> looked<00:05:53.140> all

some it just sort of makes it looked all

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.460 
some it just sort of makes it looked all
like<00:05:53.910> freshly<00:05:54.910> painted<00:05:55.330> models<00:05:55.930> or<00:05:56.140> something

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.470 
like freshly painted models or something

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:57.970 
like freshly painted models or something
I'm<00:05:57.130> not<00:05:57.190> really<00:05:57.310> sure<00:05:57.700> what

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:57.980 
I'm not really sure what

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.430 
I'm not really sure what
the<00:05:58.180> why<00:05:59.180> it<00:05:59.240> has<00:05:59.510> that<00:05:59.750> effect<00:06:00.020> on<00:06:00.140> my<00:06:00.260> eyes

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:00.440 
the why it has that effect on my eyes

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.260 
the why it has that effect on my eyes
but<00:06:00.890> I've<00:06:01.460> kind<00:06:01.700> of<00:06:01.760> noticed<00:06:02.030> that<00:06:02.150> if<00:06:02.240> you

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:02.270 
but I've kind of noticed that if you

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.110 
but I've kind of noticed that if you
increase<00:06:02.600> the<00:06:02.810> contrast<00:06:03.260> and<00:06:03.470> saturation<00:06:04.120> you

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 
increase the contrast and saturation you

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.290 
increase the contrast and saturation you
really<00:06:05.540> do<00:06:05.660> get<00:06:05.930> this<00:06:06.110> sort<00:06:06.680> of<00:06:06.800> toy<00:06:07.430> model
