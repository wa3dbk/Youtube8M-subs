17-inch equivalent screens it also

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.580 
17-inch equivalent screens it also
accepts<00:01:12.330> dual<00:01:12.479> inputs<00:01:12.960> so<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.229> one<00:01:13.380> right

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
accepts dual inputs so the one right

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.740

smartphone so you can actually multitask
in<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.420> way<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:24.720> goes<00:01:24.869> beyond<00:01:25.320> just<00:01:25.650> using

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
in a way that goes beyond just using

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.490 
in a way that goes beyond just using
your<00:01:26.310> computer<00:01:26.880> in<00:01:27.150> two<00:01:27.450> different<00:01:27.630> ways<00:01:27.960> it

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
your computer in two different ways it

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.580 
your computer in two different ways it
uses<00:01:28.860> IP<00:01:29.189> an<00:01:29.610> IPS<00:01:30.060> panel<00:01:30.540> which<00:01:30.900> means<00:01:31.229> that<00:01:31.560> I

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
uses IP an IPS panel which means that I

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.140 
uses IP an IPS panel which means that I
can't<00:01:31.950> come<00:01:32.100> on<00:01:32.159> guys<00:01:32.369> for<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.610> screen<00:01:32.909> this

also from a Productivity standpoint
something<00:01:45.270> like<00:01:45.420> this<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:45.840> again

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
something like this is again

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.700 
something like this is again
game-changing<00:01:47.579> if<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:48.119> use<00:01:48.329> Excel<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.810> lot<00:01:49.140> if

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
game-changing if you use Excel a lot if

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.069 
game-changing if you use Excel a lot if
height<00:01:50.460> isn't<00:01:51.060> as<00:01:51.149> important<00:01:51.659> to<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:51.960> you

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
height isn't as important to you and you

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.440

work with very long spreadsheets this

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.929 
work with very long spreadsheets this
could<00:01:54.840> be<00:01:55.020> an<00:01:55.409> enormous<00:01:55.860> time-saver<00:01:56.610> because

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
could be an enormous time-saver because

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.100 
could be an enormous time-saver because
you<00:01:57.030> don't<00:01:57.210> have<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.479> contend<00:01:57.869> with<00:01:57.930> the

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110
