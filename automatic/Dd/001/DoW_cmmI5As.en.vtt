00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:06.299
 no no no no no no no 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:15.340
 sometimes if we do not use the pad touches in 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.860
 our laptop this results 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.780
 extremely annoying interfering 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:24.119
 disastrously in our work 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.119
 when we write or use a mouse 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.369
 but in the case of the synaptics brand in 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.200
 many times there is no 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.200
 option to disable it in the 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.809
 touch pad properties this happens 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:42.710
 especially in brands like lenovo hp 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:44.809
 samsung etcetera synaptics hides this 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.960
 option to the user for some strange 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:46.960
 reason 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.260
 in this tutorial we are going to show you how 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.330
 make the synaptics touch pad 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.120
 disconnect automatically as soon as 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:03.360
 we connect a mouse to your notebook by 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.309
 example if we connect a usb mouse the 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.080
 touch pad automatically 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.080
 disable to not bother us 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.770
 let's see in many laptops when we go 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.110
 to control panel and we try to see the 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.180
 properties of the touch pad synaptics 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.180
 we see that he has no option to 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.940
 disable it there should be the option 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.880
 like in this image that I frame in red 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.159
 and yet there's no synaptics has 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.970
 removed for the touch pad to be 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:42.970
 always operative 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.970
 then to show that option we're going 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.030
 to the start menu and we click on 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.730
 execute we write the word regedit and 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.340
 we give you to accept this brings us to 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.740
 registration in the registry we have to 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.160
 look for the following the local hkey key 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.160
 machine 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.140
 we deploy it and look for software 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:25.659
 then synaptics 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.659
 then without pen 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.760
 and we stay there we watch the 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.890
 simpe content and we check if 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.650
 there is the key of sable inpe of faith to 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.740
 tourÃ© you can see the exact name in the 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.890
 description of the video if that does not exist 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.500
 key we have to create it we copy the 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.230
 name of the key we right click 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:54.430
 in the record in without pent we click 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:58.260
 in new word 32-bit we accept and paste 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.260
 the name of the key in the name 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.020
 and now comes the most important part 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:07.470
 we click on the key 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:10.740
 we choose to edit in value we write the 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.830
 number 33 and we make sure you're 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:16.380
 selected the hexadecimal option 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:18.930
 we click accept and the 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.480
 key created in the registry now 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:24.360
 we wait a few seconds and if we have the 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.400
 connected mouse will appear a message on 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.470
 the taskbar saying that already the 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:32.570
 touch pad has been disabled because 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.570
 there is a usb mouse connected 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:48.400
 here we get the message on the touch pad 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:48.400
 it's off 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:00.590
 from now on every time you have the 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:04.410
 mouse connected to the laptop the touch pad 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:07.050
 automatically disable 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.820
 now in the properties of the touch pad 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.460
 we check that we already have available 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.490
 this option that we can mark or 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:16.530
 uncheck according to our needs 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:18.840
 The whole process is also explained 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.090
 in the description of the video is 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.160
 interesting to copy it and paste it in the 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.380
 notebook to have at hand all 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.460
 the steps I hope you have served 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.460
 this tutorial 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.330
 Thank you 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.490
 for me
