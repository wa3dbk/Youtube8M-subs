00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
really good it was a very low budget

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.369 
really good it was a very low budget
apparently<00:00:42.000> but<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.270> could<00:00:42.420> not<00:00:42.629> tell<00:00:42.930> that

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.500 
apparently but you could not tell that
it<00:00:43.469> was<00:00:43.500> low<00:00:43.710> budget<00:00:44.070> at<00:00:44.190> all<00:00:44.309> it's<00:00:45.239> basically

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
it was low budget at all it's basically

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.350 
it was low budget at all it's basically
the<00:00:45.600> story<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.230> alien<00:00:46.860> race<00:00:47.039> that's<00:00:47.910> kind<00:00:48.270> of
