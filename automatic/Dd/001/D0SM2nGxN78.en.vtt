 presence on the walk with afghanistan 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.759
 for him the population does not understand how democracy in comparison 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:26.749
 Yearly 

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:28.999
 there are 60 for each forum 

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:31.940
 and despite receiving salary 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:36.610
 Never before has the series b come back to be protagonist in the process to 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:37.810
 company 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.690
 I'm not going to start working on him leaving marcelo tas and are sure 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.510
 still unsure of the sector 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.700
 ours is that the public reconciliation work is to participate of the people 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.230
 the body of marcia would do again boss is recording lover shows the real the 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.090
 Battle for the front is part of them so I think it's going to be pretty cool. 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.090
 talk to the client and workload 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.870
 I'll talk to the businessman's father Marcos 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.330
 firefighters from three cities where experience 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.410
 so they are games like normal video game only the difference 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:29.410
 is that their goal is to promote a brand or product 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.390
 so it's not as big as a video game, and it's usually a 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.390
 game that the web is a faster thing 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.470
 - we're all in it a lot 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.220
 this too 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.760
 shown in the game 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.100
 every page of congratulations said that each side 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.890
 So I'm not 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.890
 from amnesty testimony 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:04.850
 basically i do 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.740
 pedestrians 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.189
 where to go 

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:09.829
 from the 15th of June 

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:12.829
 proposed that we have been together for some time 

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:16.699
 complementing the debts of agencies 

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:19.699
 Sandy's conclusion came into his life 

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:23.659
 You took it out of us. 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:25.189
 developed 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:27.839
 her version of the year 

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:31.019
 trying to seek a partnership to develop the version which is a 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:32.239
 military spokesman 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.299
 it is a mixture of employability 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.349
 that polo shirt 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:40.910
 a central point is the case of most of them had to intervene 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.899
 combining government issues 

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:44.799
 to feed the puppies 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:47.509
 10 

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:50.509
 still many months and work harder 

00:02:51.279 --> 00:02:53.159
 best 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:56.350
 He does not have a date yet, like Brazil. 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.500
 I have more and more not the way we know ahead the team has come to 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.910
 lend a complaint where 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:05.420
 It's very difficult, but we can already do it for the event. 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.029
 strong by your side 

00:03:07.029 --> 00:03:10.199
 confronted with the general public 

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:11.239
 the young audience 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:15.049
 it really me but not only the gls public that lost some of the public 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.829
 child is more adult because most of the people who played 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:21.829
 yesterday on average 30 years or more 

00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:26.890
 make the afternoon 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.890
 the programming also the testimony of the entrepreneur 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:32.589
 in parallel with the water 

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:33.609
 the brazilian 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:35.889
 the Internet 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:37.569
 let's try to do 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:40.569
 middle-level position complete with lots of charm 

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:45.029
 in function of the planet 

00:03:45.029 --> 00:03:48.029
 the governor of kandahar 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:56.339
 be the first 

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:59.339
 during the knife operation 

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:04.799
 the attraction 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.299
 will be negotiated at 70 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:10.249
 for each item that deals with the theme 

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:13.129
 and he has a contract he will be 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:14.139
 do not lose 

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:18.190
 good will happen even one of the major pathologies the operation 

00:04:18.189 --> 00:04:19.549
 will have someone 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.939
 and much more the complete programming of dealing with the public 

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:25.939
 Numbers are just a creative way 

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:29.249
 seems to be quite interesting and quite receptive, which is 

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:30.340
 very important 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.640
 we will enter pmdb not even welcome in either of them because as it has 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:38.430
 a lot of men this market is really needing more women 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.880
 and a later one of the personnel to interested in that area really the part of many 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.020
 different paths then search 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.539
 go after the interests of those who already work with it because if you 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:52.680
 get what you like with what's practical for sure 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.710
 these boos are expected to have expired 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.770
