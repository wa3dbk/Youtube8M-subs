00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
want to mention last week is in skills

want to mention last week is in skills
lab<00:01:49.229> I<00:01:51.290> really<00:01:52.290> didn't<00:01:52.530> know<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:53.100> it<00:01:53.670> would

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
lab I really didn't know that it would

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.170 
lab I really didn't know that it would
be<00:01:54.000> so<00:01:54.240> difficult<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:55.020> just<00:01:55.680> make<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:55.920> bed

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
be so difficult to just make a bed

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.789 
be so difficult to just make a bed
but<00:01:58.180> there<00:01:58.479> are<00:01:58.510> a<00:01:58.689> lot<00:01:58.869> of<00:01:58.900> steps<00:01:59.229> involved

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799

but there are a lot of steps involved
and<00:02:01.740> it's<00:02:02.740> got<00:02:02.860> a<00:02:02.890> practice<00:02:03.340> to<00:02:03.460> get<00:02:03.549> it<00:02:03.700> down

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
and it's got a practice to get it down

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.479 
and it's got a practice to get it down
what<00:02:06.250> else<00:02:07.170> in<00:02:08.170> addition<00:02:08.440> to<00:02:08.830> learning<00:02:09.190> how<00:02:09.429> to
