00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
that harsh edge okay so the final step

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:30.060 
that harsh edge okay so the final step
is<00:04:24.880> to<00:04:24.910> line<00:04:25.330> the<00:04:25.570> eyes<00:04:25.720> and<00:04:26.200> I<00:04:26.800> used<00:04:27.640> a<00:04:29.070> angled

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.070 
is to line the eyes and I used a angled

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.850 
is to line the eyes and I used a angled
brush<00:04:30.730> with<00:04:31.450> one<00:04:31.870> of<00:04:31.960> the<00:04:32.050> shadows<00:04:32.470> in<00:04:32.740> the

brush with one of the shadows in the
palette<00:04:33.250> rather<00:04:33.520> than<00:04:34.080> using<00:04:35.080> a<00:04:35.290> liner<00:04:35.530> so<00:04:36.280> the

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 
palette rather than using a liner so the

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.310 
palette rather than using a liner so the
shadow<00:04:36.640> that<00:04:36.820> I<00:04:36.880> used<00:04:37.210> is<00:04:37.420> that<00:04:37.450> same<00:04:37.960> color

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
tap off all the excess water because you

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:56.940 
tap off all the excess water because you
don't<00:04:55.330> want<00:04:55.630> there<00:04:55.960> to<00:04:55.990> be<00:04:56.170> too<00:04:56.260> much<00:04:56.560> water<00:04:56.800> on

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
don't want there to be too much water on

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.680 
don't want there to be too much water on
the<00:04:57.130> brush<00:04:57.310> because<00:04:57.790> there's<00:04:58.180> too<00:04:58.360> much<00:04:58.480> water

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
the brush because there's too much water

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.300 
the brush because there's too much water
on<00:04:58.930> the<00:04:59.020> brush<00:04:59.170> that's<00:04:59.440> going<00:04:59.620> to<00:04:59.740> dilute<00:05:00.070> the

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
on the brush that's going to dilute the

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.450 
on the brush that's going to dilute the
pigmentation<00:05:01.270> of<00:05:01.450> the<00:05:01.510> shadow<00:05:02.130> so<00:05:03.130> you're

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
pigmentation of the shadow so you're

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.700 
pigmentation of the shadow so you're
going<00:05:03.700> to<00:05:03.760> just<00:05:03.880> take<00:05:04.090> that<00:05:04.390> brush<00:05:04.660> and<00:05:05.080> you're

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
going to just take that brush and you're

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.860 
going to just take that brush and you're
going<00:05:06.010> to<00:05:06.070> tap<00:05:06.880> it<00:05:06.910> into<00:05:07.540> that<00:05:08.020> color<00:05:08.800> there

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
going to tap it into that color there

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.870 
going to tap it into that color there
and<00:05:10.870> what<00:05:11.050> I<00:05:11.080> do<00:05:11.200> is<00:05:11.670> mm-hmm

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
and what I do is mm-hmm

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.330 
and what I do is mm-hmm
usually<00:05:13.630> pull<00:05:13.840> up<00:05:14.050> on<00:05:14.290> my<00:05:14.560> eye<00:05:14.590> a<00:05:14.740> little<00:05:15.040> bit

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
usually pull up on my eye a little bit

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.360 
usually pull up on my eye a little bit
so<00:05:15.880> that<00:05:15.910> it's<00:05:16.180> like<00:05:16.390> very<00:05:16.660> taut<00:05:17.020> and<00:05:17.380> I<00:05:18.040> start

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
so that it's like very taut and I start

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.110 
so that it's like very taut and I start
out<00:05:18.520> by<00:05:18.850> creating<00:05:19.210> the<00:05:20.200> flick<00:05:20.530> that<00:05:20.920> I<00:05:20.950> want<00:05:21.310> so

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
out by creating the flick that I want so

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.050 
out by creating the flick that I want so
using<00:05:22.810> the<00:05:22.990> angle<00:05:23.350> I<00:05:23.620> sort<00:05:24.280> of<00:05:24.370> just<00:05:24.640> stamp

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
using the angle I sort of just stamp

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.080 
using the angle I sort of just stamp
that<00:05:25.360> flick<00:05:25.840> on<00:05:26.080> there<00:05:26.380> first<00:05:26.800> and<00:05:27.160> then<00:05:28.060> I

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
that flick on there first and then I

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.080 
that flick on there first and then I
flip<00:05:28.660> the<00:05:28.870> brush<00:05:29.020> in<00:05:29.350> and<00:05:29.680> just<00:05:30.460> line<00:05:30.820> my<00:05:31.060> eye

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 
flip the brush in and just line my eye

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:38.160 
flip the brush in and just line my eye
with<00:05:32.080> that<00:05:32.350> shadow<00:05:36.420> get<00:05:37.420> all<00:05:37.600> the<00:05:37.750> way<00:05:37.840> into

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:38.170 
with that shadow get all the way into

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:43.330 
with that shadow get all the way into
the<00:05:38.260> inner<00:05:38.410> corner

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:43.340 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.810 

and<00:05:43.820> now<00:05:44.150> what<00:05:44.660> you<00:05:44.780> want<00:05:44.990> to<00:05:45.110> do<00:05:45.260> is<00:05:45.820> connect

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:46.820 
and now what you want to do is connect

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.960 
and now what you want to do is connect
the<00:05:47.270> flip<00:05:47.630> on<00:05:47.900> to<00:05:48.620> the<00:05:48.740> rest<00:05:48.980> of<00:05:49.250> the<00:05:49.370> eye<00:05:49.400> so<00:05:49.850> it

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:49.970 
the flip on to the rest of the eye so it

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:53.650 
the flip on to the rest of the eye so it
doesn't<00:05:50.270> look<00:05:50.480> so<00:05:50.990> harsh<00:05:52.120> so<00:05:53.120> I'm<00:05:53.390> just<00:05:53.540> gonna

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:53.660 
doesn't look so harsh so I'm just gonna

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.440 
doesn't look so harsh so I'm just gonna
go<00:05:53.900> ahead<00:05:53.990> and<00:05:54.170> take<00:05:54.620> that<00:05:54.940> and<00:05:55.940> just<00:05:56.210> kind<00:05:56.390> of

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:56.450 
go ahead and take that and just kind of

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:00.370 
go ahead and take that and just kind of
draw<00:05:56.750> a<00:05:56.990> line<00:05:58.000> to<00:05:59.000> connect<00:05:59.420> it<00:05:59.780> to<00:05:59.960> the<00:06:00.050> rest<00:06:00.260> of

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:00.380 
draw a line to connect it to the rest of

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:07.030 
draw a line to connect it to the rest of
my<00:06:00.440> eye<00:06:04.600> so<00:06:05.600> that's<00:06:05.780> the<00:06:05.990> liner<00:06:06.260> on<00:06:06.590> the<00:06:06.680> top

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:07.040

I don't like to go all the way into the

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:24.700 
I don't like to go all the way into the
inner<00:06:20.390> crease<00:06:20.930> just<00:06:22.030> kind<00:06:23.030> of<00:06:23.150> stamp<00:06:23.480> it<00:06:23.780> onto

just my personal preference now with
this<00:06:34.070> look<00:06:34.340> you<00:06:34.700> could<00:06:35.030> also<00:06:36.100> use<00:06:37.100> one<00:06:37.400> of<00:06:37.490> the

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:37.610 
this look you could also use one of the

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:39.520 
this look you could also use one of the
dark<00:06:37.820> green<00:06:38.030> colors<00:06:38.450> and<00:06:38.720> smoke<00:06:39.020> that<00:06:39.050> under

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:39.530 
dark green colors and smoke that under

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:42.370 
dark green colors and smoke that under
the<00:06:39.650> eye<00:06:39.680> but<00:06:40.550> I<00:06:40.820> just<00:06:41.120> decided<00:06:41.630> to<00:06:41.780> use<00:06:42.080> the

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:42.380 
the eye but I just decided to use the

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:44.620 
the eye but I just decided to use the
dark<00:06:42.680> liner<00:06:43.370> cuz<00:06:43.760> that's<00:06:43.910> sort<00:06:44.390> of<00:06:44.450> what<00:06:44.600> I

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:44.630 
dark liner cuz that's sort of what I

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:47.650 
dark liner cuz that's sort of what I
prefer<00:06:45.550> and<00:06:46.550> the<00:06:46.640> last<00:06:46.850> step<00:06:47.090> for<00:06:47.150> this<00:06:47.420> look

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:47.660 
prefer and the last step for this look

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.370 
prefer and the last step for this look
is<00:06:47.900> just<00:06:48.290> taking<00:06:48.650> your<00:06:49.090> eyelash<00:06:50.090> curler<00:06:50.480> and

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:51.380 
is just taking your eyelash curler and

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:57.220 
is just taking your eyelash curler and
curling<00:06:52.010> your<00:06:52.070> lashes<00:06:55.510> and<00:06:56.510> then<00:06:56.960> I'm<00:06:57.110> gonna
