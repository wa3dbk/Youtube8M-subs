as I said the action is amazing it's

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.620 
as I said the action is amazing it's
super<00:00:42.829> light<00:00:43.040> so<00:00:43.610> you<00:00:43.730> know<00:00:43.820> I<00:00:43.850> mean<00:00:44.090> I'm<00:00:44.300> lucky

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:44.630 
super light so you know I mean I'm lucky

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:46.120 
super light so you know I mean I'm lucky
enough<00:00:44.750> not<00:00:45.020> to<00:00:45.079> really<00:00:45.410> have<00:00:45.560> to<00:00:45.680> like<00:00:45.890> care

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.130 
enough not to really have to like care

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.889 
enough not to really have to like care
about<00:00:46.340> too<00:00:46.579> much<00:00:46.760> but<00:00:46.820> if<00:00:47.210> I<00:00:47.329> did<00:00:47.510> have<00:00:47.630> to<00:00:47.750> do

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
about too much but if I did have to do

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:49.810 
about too much but if I did have to do
I'd<00:00:48.530> be<00:00:48.739> able<00:00:48.829> to<00:00:48.890> fit<00:00:49.100> this<00:00:49.190> in<00:00:49.399> the<00:00:49.489> back<00:00:49.670> of

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
I'd be able to fit this in the back of

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.410 
I'd be able to fit this in the back of
my<00:00:49.910> camp<00:00:50.180> for<00:00:50.300> that<00:00:50.420> very<00:00:50.630> very<00:00:50.960> easily<00:00:52.420> and

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
my camp for that very very easily and

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:55.000 
my camp for that very very easily and
then<00:00:53.720> I<00:00:53.870> suppose<00:00:54.230> in<00:00:54.410> terms<00:00:54.620> of<00:00:54.920> the

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
then I suppose in terms of the

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.420 
then I suppose in terms of the
ergonomics<00:00:55.700> it's<00:00:56.000> really<00:00:56.510> easy<00:00:57.079> and<00:00:57.770> well<00:00:58.130> set

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
ergonomics it's really easy and well set

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.010 
ergonomics it's really easy and well set
out<00:00:58.670> you<00:00:59.030> know<00:00:59.149> if<00:00:59.300> you<00:00:59.390> want<00:00:59.570> to<00:00:59.660> just<00:00:59.809> Chuck<00:00:59.989> a

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
out you know if you want to just Chuck a

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:07.149 
out you know if you want to just Chuck a
bit<00:01:00.110> of<00:01:00.320> reverb<00:01:00.469> on<00:01:05.350> that<00:01:06.350> makes<00:01:06.590> it<00:01:06.799> kind<00:01:07.039> of

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
bit of reverb on that makes it kind of

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.020 
bit of reverb on that makes it kind of
quite<00:01:07.459> usable<00:01:09.369> of<00:01:10.369> you<00:01:10.520> that<00:01:10.729> you<00:01:10.819> can<00:01:10.999> just

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
quite usable of you that you can just

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.649 
quite usable of you that you can just
easily<00:01:12.100> interact<00:01:13.100> with<00:01:13.310> the<00:01:13.429> sounds<00:01:13.969> again

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
easily interact with the sounds again

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:16.779 
easily interact with the sounds again
it's<00:01:15.079> got<00:01:15.170> EQ<00:01:15.649> on<00:01:15.799> the<00:01:15.889> right<00:01:16.039> hand<00:01:16.310> side<00:01:16.579> as

00:01:16.779 --> 00:01:16.789 
it's got EQ on the right hand side as

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:19.059 
it's got EQ on the right hand side as
well<00:01:16.969> so<00:01:17.389> it's<00:01:17.840> that's<00:01:18.200> really<00:01:18.499> easy<00:01:18.560> to<00:01:18.740> tweak

00:01:19.059 --> 00:01:19.069 
well so it's that's really easy to tweak

00:01:19.069 --> 00:01:21.730 
well so it's that's really easy to tweak
as<00:01:19.279> well<00:01:19.509> literally<00:01:20.509> takes<00:01:20.810> a<00:01:21.049> minute<00:01:21.649> to

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
as well literally takes a minute to

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.190 
as well literally takes a minute to
tweak<00:01:22.069> it<00:01:22.189> to<00:01:22.249> your<00:01:22.399> personal<00:01:22.819> taste<00:01:23.170> so<00:01:24.170> I

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
tweak it to your personal taste so I

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.660 
tweak it to your personal taste so I
think<00:01:24.409> that's<00:01:24.740> that's<00:01:24.950> a<00:01:25.069> great<00:01:25.189> feature

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
think that's that's a great feature

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.239 
think that's that's a great feature
I<00:01:25.789> guess<00:01:25.999> brilliant<00:01:26.779> and<00:01:27.049> finally<00:01:27.499> to<00:01:27.560> cp4<00:01:28.100> has

00:01:28.239 --> 00:01:28.249 
I guess brilliant and finally to cp4 has

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:30.849 
I guess brilliant and finally to cp4 has
many<00:01:28.490> sounds<00:01:28.880> which<00:01:29.149> is<00:01:29.299> your<00:01:29.450> favorite<00:01:29.859> well
