00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.309
 times that change rapidly and in the room 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.510
 There were so many educators 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.719
 first place and only place 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:48.640
 of education to the person very often 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:51.649
 is confused the question is confused with 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:54.559
 issues rules environments situation the 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.949
 person is the affirmation and the 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:59.839
 self communication then the question 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:02.269
 who are you 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:05.269
 based on the answer or better yet 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:07.780
 the experience that you live companies of if 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:11.630
 this if this fascinated me 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:14.390
 in love with life he communicates that 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.580
 that we call family education e 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.030
 school what role families and schools play 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:23.510
 they are very important because they are perhaps i 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:26.450
 two absolute places that help 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.100
 this come out of god this 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.500
 therefore it becomes a large office 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.750
 education has as its task one 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.690
 of 20 himself 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:38.120
 the two most extraordinary areas 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:39.800
 fascinating for this work and for 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.020
 this path is really the family 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.730
 the school are in good health the 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.700
 family school or something from 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:49.550
 do no there is a lot to do but there is a lot to 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.370
 do on the I about the person because also 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:56.150
 school and family are the outcome of 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:58.100
 an ego that exists or is not there if there is no god 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.590
 there will be no family in the school 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.830
 but the adults are fascinating work 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:07.330
 family ills we also leave 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:11.770
 of it starts from the conscience now more 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:14.530
 which is a bit gone I say so I try 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.470
 tell you about the family so many times now 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:20.820
 is conceived as a couple that together 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:25.030
 goes towards me continues to say no 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:27.370
 the family are two I own large 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:31.830
 because they are two or large they put on 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.830
 together for a task we start from here
