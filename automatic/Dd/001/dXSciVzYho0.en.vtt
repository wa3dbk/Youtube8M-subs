this nice little sand castle thing I

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.649 
this nice little sand castle thing I
based<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:03.989> completely<00:01:04.769> on<00:01:05.240> another<00:01:06.240> design

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
based it completely on another design

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.740 
based it completely on another design
and<00:01:06.960> it's<00:01:07.200> not<00:01:07.530> my<00:01:07.830> design<00:01:08.220> whatsoever<00:01:08.490> I<00:01:09.119> just

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
and it's not my design whatsoever I just

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.590 
and it's not my design whatsoever I just
wanted<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.110> see<00:01:10.290> if<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.920> could<00:01:11.159> replicate<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:12.210> so

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
wanted to see if I could replicate it so

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.630 
wanted to see if I could replicate it so
this<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.619> what<00:01:13.740> I've<00:01:13.830> been<00:01:13.860> working<00:01:14.189> on<00:01:14.280> for

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
this is what I've been working on for

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.600 
this is what I've been working on for
I'd<00:01:15.210> say<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.509> few<00:01:15.750> weeks<00:01:16.020> I've<00:01:16.290> been<00:01:16.350> not<00:01:17.280> doing

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
I'd say a few weeks I've been not doing

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.969 
I'd say a few weeks I've been not doing
this<00:01:18.000> straight<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:18.509> would<00:01:18.659> be<00:01:18.979> horribly

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
this straight that would be horribly

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.130 
this straight that would be horribly
wrong<00:01:20.640> so<00:01:21.060> yeah<00:01:21.330> I've<00:01:21.479> been<00:01:21.630> working<00:01:21.900> on<00:01:21.990> this

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
wrong so yeah I've been working on this

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.460 
wrong so yeah I've been working on this
for<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.439> while<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:23.570> this<00:01:24.570> has<00:01:24.780> been<00:01:25.110> my<00:01:25.259> big

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
for a while and this has been my big

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.819 
for a while and this has been my big
project<00:01:25.770> of<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.280> year<00:01:26.520> so<00:01:26.729> far<00:01:26.759> really<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:28.080> I

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
project of the year so far really and I

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.179 
project of the year so far really and I
think<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.820> looks<00:01:29.970> pretty<00:01:30.119> good<00:01:30.619> but<00:01:31.619> we're

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
think it looks pretty good but we're

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.609 
think it looks pretty good but we're
gonna<00:01:32.280> go<00:01:32.490> in<00:01:32.670> it<00:01:32.820> here<00:01:33.240> so<00:01:33.869> that<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.170> can<00:01:34.380> see

gonna<00:02:17.400> call<00:02:17.640> it<00:02:17.730> a<00:02:17.760> sand<00:02:18.000> castle<00:02:18.210> since<00:02:18.660> it's

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
gonna call it a sand castle since it's

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.410 
gonna call it a sand castle since it's
in<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.020> middle<00:02:19.230> of<00:02:19.320> the<00:02:19.440> desert<00:02:19.620> so<00:02:20.280> here<00:02:21.210> is

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
in the middle of the desert so here is

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.950 
in the middle of the desert so here is
the<00:02:21.690> fountain<00:02:22.260> I<00:02:22.440> designed<00:02:22.830> and<00:02:23.720> it's<00:02:24.720> not

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
the fountain I designed and it's not

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.590 
the fountain I designed and it's not
very<00:02:25.200> symmetrical<00:02:25.890> but<00:02:26.520> I<00:02:26.670> worked<00:02:26.970> on<00:02:27.120> it<00:02:27.300> a

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
very symmetrical but I worked on it a

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.620 
very symmetrical but I worked on it a
little<00:02:28.260> while<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:29.030> it<00:02:30.030> goes<00:02:30.210> all<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.420> way<00:02:30.510> to

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
little while and it goes all the way to

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.710 
little while and it goes all the way to
the<00:02:30.900> floor<00:02:31.500> as<00:02:31.890> you<00:02:32.280> saw<00:02:32.850> earlier<00:02:33.120> to<00:02:33.630> the

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
the floor as you saw earlier to the

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.070 
the floor as you saw earlier to the
ground<00:02:33.990> level<00:02:34.410> and<00:02:35.480> it's<00:02:36.480> pretty<00:02:36.720> empty<00:02:36.900> in

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
ground level and it's pretty empty in

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.590 
ground level and it's pretty empty in
here<00:02:37.140> I<00:02:37.320> haven't<00:02:37.500> really<00:02:37.770> fringed<00:02:38.190> it<00:02:38.600> and

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
here I haven't really fringed it and

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.699 
here I haven't really fringed it and
this<00:02:39.750> is<00:02:39.930> more<00:02:40.170> of<00:02:40.290> them

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
this is more of them

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.010 
this is more of them
I'll<00:02:41.130> look<00:02:41.340> out<00:02:41.520> area<00:02:41.730> where<00:02:42.030> you<00:02:42.120> can<00:02:42.300> hang

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
I'll look out area where you can hang

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.160 
I'll look out area where you can hang
out<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:43.709> look<00:02:44.640> on<00:02:44.820> two<00:02:45.090> different<00:02:45.690> things

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
out and look on two different things

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.400 
out and look on two different things
so<00:02:46.590> I<00:02:47.090> might<00:02:48.090> furnish<00:02:48.480> it<00:02:48.720> later<00:02:48.900> not<00:02:49.140> really

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
so I might furnish it later not really

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.400 
so I might furnish it later not really
sure<00:02:49.650> it<00:02:49.890> took<00:02:50.190> so<00:02:50.490> long<00:02:50.520> building<00:02:51.209> this

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
sure it took so long building this

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.280 
sure it took so long building this
though<00:02:52.410> but<00:02:52.980> I<00:02:53.220> don't<00:02:53.520> know<00:02:53.640> if<00:02:53.790> I<00:02:53.940> want<00:02:54.180> to<00:02:54.390> but

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
though but I don't know if I want to but

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.220 
though but I don't know if I want to but
I<00:02:55.500> think<00:02:55.530> it<00:02:55.800> looks<00:02:55.860> pretty<00:02:56.220> cool<00:02:56.489> without

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
I think it looks pretty cool without

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.860 
I think it looks pretty cool without
anything<00:02:58.230> added<00:02:58.440> on<00:02:58.739> to<00:02:58.980> it<00:02:59.130> and<00:02:59.310> here<00:03:00.300> is<00:03:00.540> the

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
anything added on to it and here is the

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.690 
anything added on to it and here is the
hotel<00:03:01.410> part<00:03:01.709> that's<00:03:01.950> what<00:03:02.070> I<00:03:02.130> call<00:03:02.400> it<00:03:02.580> at

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
hotel part that's what I call it at

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.250 
hotel part that's what I call it at
least<00:03:02.850> since<00:03:03.150> it<00:03:03.330> kind<00:03:03.540> of<00:03:03.600> looks<00:03:03.780> like<00:03:03.870> a

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
least since it kind of looks like a

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.580 
least since it kind of looks like a
hotel<00:03:05.100> or<00:03:05.250> something<00:03:05.280> and<00:03:06.260> you<00:03:07.260> can<00:03:07.440> do

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
hotel or something and you can do

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.110 
hotel or something and you can do
whatever<00:03:07.830> you<00:03:08.100> want<00:03:08.310> there<00:03:08.610> add<00:03:08.820> some

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
whatever you want there add some

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.610 
whatever you want there add some
furnaces<00:03:09.600> or<00:03:09.750> something<00:03:10.110> make<00:03:10.320> it<00:03:10.440> a<00:03:10.500> little

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
furnaces or something make it a little

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.250 
furnaces or something make it a little
kitchen<00:03:11.100> so<00:03:11.910> we're<00:03:12.090> gonna<00:03:12.180> go<00:03:12.420> walking<00:03:13.110> up

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
kitchen so we're gonna go walking up

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.250 
kitchen so we're gonna go walking up
into<00:03:13.470> this<00:03:13.770> hotel<00:03:14.220> area<00:03:14.730> and<00:03:15.209> I<00:03:15.720> didn't<00:03:16.080> build

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
into this hotel area and I didn't build

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.690 
into this hotel area and I didn't build
a<00:03:16.500> back<00:03:16.739> part<00:03:17.070> because<00:03:17.250> I<00:03:17.340> thought<00:03:17.459> it<00:03:17.610> looked

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
a back part because I thought it looked

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.880 
a back part because I thought it looked
cool<00:03:18.030> looking<00:03:18.840> out<00:03:18.959> onto<00:03:19.260> the<00:03:19.380> ocean<00:03:19.530> like

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
cool looking out onto the ocean like

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
cool looking out onto the ocean like
that<00:03:20.100> so<00:03:20.370> we're<00:03:21.209> gonna<00:03:21.390> look<00:03:21.600> onto<00:03:21.930> that<00:03:22.049> and

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
that so we're gonna look onto that and

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.199 
that so we're gonna look onto that and
here<00:03:23.910> is<00:03:24.269> a<00:03:24.720> nice<00:03:25.080> aerial<00:03:25.830> view<00:03:26.130> from<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:27.030> top

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
here is a nice aerial view from the top

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.380 
here is a nice aerial view from the top
of<00:03:27.570> this<00:03:28.049> it<00:03:28.290> looks<00:03:28.410> pretty<00:03:28.709> cool<00:03:28.980> I<00:03:29.250> like<00:03:29.820> it<00:03:30.120> I

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
of this it looks pretty cool I like it I

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.470 
of this it looks pretty cool I like it I
like<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:31.260> design<00:03:31.620> of<00:03:31.650> this<00:03:31.830> and<00:03:32.400> here's<00:03:33.269> the

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
like the design of this and here's the

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.470 
like the design of this and here's the
ocean<00:03:33.930> view<00:03:34.170> and<00:03:34.910> obviously<00:03:35.910> I<00:03:36.030> can't<00:03:36.360> even

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
ocean view and obviously I can't even

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.960 
ocean view and obviously I can't even
stay<00:03:36.840> on<00:03:36.870> the<00:03:37.080> building<00:03:37.430> it<00:03:38.430> completely<00:03:38.940> just

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
stay on the building it completely just

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.400 
stay on the building it completely just
fell<00:03:39.420> off<00:03:39.600> there<00:03:39.959> oh<00:03:40.370> my<00:03:41.370> gosh<00:03:41.580> alright<00:03:42.030> so<00:03:42.900> and

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
fell off there oh my gosh alright so and

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.410 
fell off there oh my gosh alright so and
then<00:03:43.680> I<00:03:43.709> made<00:03:44.070> some<00:03:45.049> nice<00:03:46.049> little<00:03:47.420> Pei

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
then I made some nice little Pei

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.570 
then I made some nice little Pei
overhangs<00:03:49.140> I<00:03:49.500> guess<00:03:49.709> that's<00:03:50.130> what<00:03:50.280> you<00:03:50.400> can

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
overhangs I guess that's what you can

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.199 
overhangs I guess that's what you can
call<00:03:50.790> it<00:03:50.970> up<00:03:51.959> here<00:03:52.290> so<00:03:52.560> it<00:03:52.680> kind<00:03:52.890> of<00:03:52.980> looks<00:03:53.220> nice

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
call it up here so it kind of looks nice

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:55.729 
call it up here so it kind of looks nice
and<00:03:54.510> he's<00:03:54.720> nice<00:03:54.989> to<00:03:55.170> look<00:03:55.350> out<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:55.709> window

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
and he's nice to look out the window

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.960 
and he's nice to look out the window
onto<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:57.019> landscaping<00:03:58.019> below<00:03:58.400> so<00:03:59.400> this<00:03:59.790> is

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
onto the landscaping below so this is

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.800 
onto the landscaping below so this is
the<00:04:00.360> whole<00:04:00.750> entire<00:04:01.200> thing<00:04:01.620> and<00:04:02.000> it<00:04:03.000> took<00:04:03.600> me<00:04:03.780> a

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
the whole entire thing and it took me a

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.960 
the whole entire thing and it took me a
long<00:04:04.049> time<00:04:04.110> to<00:04:04.530> build<00:04:04.980> this<00:04:05.130> but<00:04:05.400> it<00:04:05.519> was<00:04:05.670> so

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
long time to build this but it was so

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.340 
long time to build this but it was so
much<00:04:06.150> fun<00:04:06.209> and<00:04:06.450> it<00:04:06.690> was<00:04:06.720> a<00:04:06.810> really<00:04:07.200> great

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
much fun and it was a really great

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.890 
much fun and it was a really great
challenge<00:04:07.980> and<00:04:08.250> I'm<00:04:09.030> really<00:04:09.269> excited<00:04:09.420> about

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
challenge and I'm really excited about

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.520 
challenge and I'm really excited about
