their router and their switches we do

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.340 
their router and their switches we do
not<00:02:46.680> buy<00:02:47.220> a<00:02:48.090> computer<00:02:48.690> system<00:02:49.080> when<00:02:49.200> we

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
not buy a computer system when we

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.710 
not buy a computer system when we
replace<00:02:49.680> one<00:02:50.040> what<00:02:50.580> we<00:02:50.700> do<00:02:50.820> is<00:02:50.910> we<00:02:51.060> buy<00:02:51.240> parts

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
replace one what we do is we buy parts

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.949 
replace one what we do is we buy parts
and<00:02:52.020> you<00:02:52.110> then<00:02:52.350> rebuild<00:02:53.220> entire<00:02:54.150> lab<00:02:54.480> and<00:02:54.810> so

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
and you then rebuild entire lab and so

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.350 
and you then rebuild entire lab and so
we<00:02:55.110> end<00:02:55.320> up<00:02:55.410> building<00:02:56.040> out<00:02:56.160> of<00:02:56.280> our<00:02:56.370> 19<00:02:56.820> labs<00:02:57.060> we

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
we end up building out of our 19 labs we

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.020 
we end up building out of our 19 labs we
will<00:02:57.540> build<00:02:57.900> about<00:02:58.320> 6<00:02:58.740> of<00:02:58.920> them<00:02:59.040> every<00:02:59.580> single

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
will build about 6 of them every single

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.060 
will build about 6 of them every single
year<00:03:00.180> so<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:00.780> students<00:03:01.110> get<00:03:01.230> to<00:03:01.260> see<00:03:01.470> free

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:02.070 
year so the students get to see free

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.090 
year so the students get to see free
with<00:03:02.670> fun<00:03:02.910> experiences<00:03:03.570> with<00:03:03.720> that<00:03:03.750> and<00:03:04.110> also
