separated<00:02:46.510> like<00:02:47.510> this<00:02:47.720> I<00:02:47.840> just<00:02:47.870> don't<00:02:48.170> me<00:02:48.320> two

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
separated like this I just don't me two

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:58.800 
separated like this I just don't me two
can<00:02:50.950> and<00:02:51.950> then<00:02:52.160> something<00:02:52.489> like<00:02:52.519> this<00:02:52.790> small

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.370 

these<00:02:59.810> are<00:03:00.049> small<00:03:00.350> I<00:03:00.680> thought<00:03:02.140> and<00:03:03.140> all<00:03:03.260> these

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
these are small I thought and all these

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:09.130 
these are small I thought and all these
CPUs<00:03:06.880> and<00:03:07.880> of<00:03:08.360> course<00:03:08.630> there's<00:03:08.900> a<00:03:08.959> little

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
CPUs and of course there's a little

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.580 
CPUs and of course there's a little
bitty<00:03:10.239> fingers<00:03:11.239> I<00:03:11.360> call<00:03:11.600> them<00:03:11.750> they<00:03:12.230> call<00:03:12.410> the

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
bitty fingers I call them they call the

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.759 
bitty fingers I call them they call the
actual<00:03:12.709> fingers<00:03:15.519> and<00:03:16.519> what<00:03:16.730> I<00:03:16.760> gotta<00:03:17.000> do<00:03:17.180> these

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
actual fingers and what I gotta do these

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.190 
actual fingers and what I gotta do these
just<00:03:18.769> clip<00:03:19.070> them<00:03:19.160> off<00:03:19.340> because<00:03:20.019> these<00:03:21.019> guys

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
just clip them off because these guys

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.420 
just clip them off because these guys
bile<00:03:21.530> they<00:03:21.709> don't<00:03:21.860> want<00:03:21.980> to<00:03:22.040> buy<00:03:22.190> all<00:03:22.310> this

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
bile they don't want to buy all this

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.979 
bile they don't want to buy all this
bulky<00:03:22.820> heavy<00:03:22.970> stuff<00:03:23.330> they<00:03:23.480> just<00:03:23.660> want<00:03:23.840> the

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
bulky heavy stuff they just want the
