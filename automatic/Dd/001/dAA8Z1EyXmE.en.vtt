00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:00.090
 who could have stopped at the side of the road 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:03.769
 waiting for someone to pass on an aid 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.940

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.490
 I did not believe the guy from the job he gave 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:25.140

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:28.960

 [Applause] 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.210

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.299

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.410

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.380
