sound and the way I'm getting that is

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.140 
sound and the way I'm getting that is
essentially<00:01:13.950> I'm<00:01:14.070> using<00:01:14.220> this<00:01:14.400> old<00:01:14.610> pedal

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
essentially I'm using this old pedal

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.380 
essentially I'm using this old pedal
right<00:01:15.360> here<00:01:15.540> called<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.870> sonic<00:01:16.080> stomp<00:01:17.300> to<00:01:18.300> be

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
right here called a sonic stomp to be

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.120 
right here called a sonic stomp to be
really<00:01:18.930> perfectly<00:01:19.380> honest<00:01:19.650> with<00:01:19.800> you<00:01:19.890> I<00:01:19.920> don't

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
really perfectly honest with you I don't

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.500 
really perfectly honest with you I don't
even<00:01:20.369> know<00:01:20.550> if<00:01:20.610> they<00:01:20.700> make<00:01:20.729> this<00:01:21.180> pedal

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510 
even know if they make this pedal

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.290 
even know if they make this pedal
anymore<00:01:21.740> but<00:01:22.740> it's<00:01:22.979> called<00:01:23.160> a<00:01:23.280> sonic<00:01:23.490> sonic

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.560 
and it's called a BB e sonic stomp sonic
Maximizer<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.310> like<00:01:35.700> this<00:01:35.910> pedal<00:01:36.300> I<00:01:36.390> think

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:49.580 
it sounds pretty good now if I turn it
off<00:01:44.060> and<00:01:45.060> here<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.300> is<00:01:45.360> again<00:01:47.840> so<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:49.050> is<00:01:49.259> you

channel you even have a leave gain you

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.880 
channel you even have a leave gain you
can<00:02:30.270> turn<00:02:30.510> that<00:02:30.690> gain<00:02:30.870> all<00:02:31.140> the<00:02:31.290> way<00:02:31.380> up<00:02:31.590> and

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.110 
can turn that gain all the way up and
you're<00:02:32.010> going<00:02:32.100> to<00:02:32.190> get<00:02:32.310> a<00:02:32.340> little<00:02:32.790> bit<00:02:33.030> of

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
you're going to get a little bit of

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.000 
you're going to get a little bit of
distortion<00:02:33.300> actually

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.869 

but<00:02:38.010> that<00:02:38.099> might<00:02:38.280> be<00:02:38.310> a<00:02:38.430> sound<00:02:38.670> that<00:02:38.760> you<00:02:38.849> want

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:38.879 
but that might be a sound that you want

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:40.640 
but that might be a sound that you want
to<00:02:39.060> go<00:02:39.150> for<00:02:39.390> generally<00:02:40.200> if<00:02:40.260> I'm<00:02:40.349> going<00:02:40.470> to<00:02:40.530> go

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
to go for generally if I'm going to go

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:41.930 
to go for generally if I'm going to go
for<00:02:40.830> a<00:02:40.860> distortion<00:02:41.280> I'm<00:02:41.430> going<00:02:41.550> to<00:02:41.610> switch<00:02:41.819> it

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
for a distortion I'm going to switch it

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.990 
for a distortion I'm going to switch it
over<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.150> this<00:02:42.360> other<00:02:42.599> channel<00:02:45.440> all<00:02:46.440> right

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
over to this other channel all right

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.350 
over to this other channel all right
versus<00:02:48.000> just<00:02:48.120> this<00:02:49.760> so<00:02:50.760> if<00:02:51.030> you<00:02:51.090> turn<00:02:51.239> that

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
versus just this so if you turn that

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.430 
versus just this so if you turn that
lead<00:02:51.569> gain<00:02:51.780> up<00:02:51.930> too<00:02:52.050> much<00:02:52.170> you're<00:02:52.290> going<00:02:52.380> to

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
lead gain up too much you're going to

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.250 
lead gain up too much you're going to
get<00:02:52.560> a<00:02:52.590> little<00:02:52.739> bit<00:02:52.920> of<00:02:52.980> crunch<00:02:53.250> now<00:02:54.140> for<00:02:55.140> that

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
get a little bit of crunch now for that

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.589 
get a little bit of crunch now for that
kind<00:02:55.440> of<00:02:55.500> warm<00:02:55.860> sound<00:02:56.280> I'm<00:02:57.060> also<00:02:57.330> doing

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
kind of warm sound I'm also doing

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.930 
kind of warm sound I'm also doing
something<00:02:57.900> interesting<00:02:58.470> with<00:02:58.890> my<00:02:59.220> guitar

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
something interesting with my guitar

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:00.979 
something interesting with my guitar
okay

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
okay

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.600 
okay
I'm<00:03:01.080> using<00:03:01.860> only<00:03:02.640> one<00:03:03.630> pickup<00:03:04.440> on<00:03:05.310> this

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
I'm using only one pickup on this

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.070 
I'm using only one pickup on this
particular<00:03:05.879> guitar<00:03:06.209> it's<00:03:06.510> a<00:03:06.569> Tom<00:03:06.750> Anderson

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
particular guitar it's a Tom Anderson

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.190 
particular guitar it's a Tom Anderson
I'm<00:03:07.830> only<00:03:08.190> using<00:03:08.970> this<00:03:09.239> front<00:03:09.599> pickup<00:03:09.959> right

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
I'm only using this front pickup right

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.360 
I'm only using this front pickup right
now<00:03:11.420> now<00:03:12.420> I<00:03:12.450> can<00:03:12.599> switch<00:03:13.079> it<00:03:13.110> and<00:03:13.500> I<00:03:13.980> can<00:03:14.190> go

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
now now I can switch it and I can go

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.550 
now now I can switch it and I can go
let's<00:03:14.670> say<00:03:14.940> to<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.480> front<00:03:15.840> and<00:03:16.079> then<00:03:16.380> this

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
let's say to the front and then this

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.400 
let's say to the front and then this
back<00:03:16.860> humbucker<00:03:17.930> it's<00:03:18.930> going<00:03:19.049> to<00:03:19.110> change<00:03:19.290> the

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
back humbucker it's going to change the

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:25.030 
back humbucker it's going to change the
sound<00:03:19.650> a<00:03:19.739> little<00:03:19.829> bit<00:03:20.069> if<00:03:20.489> I<00:03:20.610> go

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.010 

here<00:03:26.040> that<00:03:26.160> and<00:03:26.640> this<00:03:27.420> thing<00:03:27.600> has<00:03:27.750> what<00:03:27.930> they

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
here that and this thing has what they

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.660 
here that and this thing has what they
call<00:03:28.050> a<00:03:28.260> switcheroo<00:03:28.740> system<00:03:29.310> it's<00:03:29.460> kind<00:03:29.610> of

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
call a switcheroo system it's kind of

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.310 
call a switcheroo system it's kind of
complicated<00:03:30.000> but<00:03:30.390> the<00:03:30.510> bottom<00:03:30.780> line<00:03:30.810> is<00:03:31.140> your

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
complicated but the bottom line is your

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.540 
complicated but the bottom line is your
guitar<00:03:31.590> is<00:03:31.680> probably<00:03:31.920> only<00:03:32.040> going<00:03:32.310> to<00:03:32.370> have

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
guitar is probably only going to have

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.360 
guitar is probably only going to have
maybe<00:03:33.170> like<00:03:34.170> two<00:03:34.500> or<00:03:34.530> three<00:03:34.710> positions

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
maybe like two or three positions

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.800 
maybe like two or three positions
depending<00:03:35.940> on<00:03:36.150> what<00:03:36.240> kind<00:03:36.330> of<00:03:36.420> guitar<00:03:36.510> you

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
depending on what kind of guitar you

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.780 
depending on what kind of guitar you
have<00:03:36.870> you<00:03:37.770> know<00:03:37.860> if<00:03:37.950> you've<00:03:38.040> got<00:03:38.160> two<00:03:38.340> pickups

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
have you know if you've got two pickups

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.370 
have you know if you've got two pickups
probably<00:03:39.360> you're<00:03:39.690> going<00:03:39.810> to<00:03:39.870> have<00:03:40.020> a<00:03:40.050> way<00:03:40.320> to

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
probably you're going to have a way to

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.350 
probably you're going to have a way to
switch<00:03:40.620> that<00:03:40.980> on<00:03:41.130> to<00:03:41.310> the<00:03:41.400> front<00:03:41.610> pickup<00:03:41.850> maybe

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
switch that on to the front pickup maybe

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.820 
switch that on to the front pickup maybe
turn<00:03:42.600> on<00:03:42.720> both<00:03:42.930> of<00:03:43.140> them<00:03:43.230> and<00:03:43.320> then<00:03:43.440> flip<00:03:43.650> it<00:03:43.740> to

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
turn on both of them and then flip it to

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.700 
turn on both of them and then flip it to
the<00:03:43.860> back<00:03:44.540> all<00:03:45.540> this<00:03:45.900> depends<00:03:46.230> on<00:03:46.320> the<00:03:46.410> kind<00:03:46.560> of

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:46.710 
the back all this depends on the kind of

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:48.500 
the back all this depends on the kind of
tone<00:03:46.920> that<00:03:46.950> you<00:03:47.130> want<00:03:47.310> to<00:03:47.370> get<00:03:47.490> but<00:03:48.210> I'm<00:03:48.300> going

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
tone that you want to get but I'm going

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:50.510 
tone that you want to get but I'm going
for<00:03:48.600> kind<00:03:48.690> of<00:03:48.810> warm<00:03:49.500> tone<00:03:49.800> most<00:03:50.130> of<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.340> time

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
for kind of warm tone most of the time

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.250 
for kind of warm tone most of the time
and<00:03:50.700> I'm<00:03:50.760> playing<00:03:50.970> clean<00:03:51.600> stuff<00:03:51.870> so<00:03:52.020> I'm<00:03:52.080> using

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
and I'm playing clean stuff so I'm using

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.870 
and I'm playing clean stuff so I'm using
the<00:03:52.380> front<00:03:52.620> pickup<00:03:53.130> and<00:03:53.370> generally<00:03:53.760> you'll

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
the front pickup and generally you'll

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.120 
the front pickup and generally you'll
want<00:03:54.030> to<00:03:54.090> switch<00:03:54.420> your<00:03:54.750> guitar<00:03:55.680> to<00:03:55.830> something

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
want to switch your guitar to something

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.950 
want to switch your guitar to something
on<00:03:56.250> the<00:03:56.400> front<00:03:56.580> pickup<00:03:57.090> to<00:03:57.420> get<00:03:57.570> that<00:03:57.720> sound

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:57.960 
on the front pickup to get that sound

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.350 
on the front pickup to get that sound
otherwise<00:03:58.760> you<00:03:59.760> know<00:03:59.850> it<00:03:59.910> depends<00:04:00.180> on<00:04:00.270> the

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:00.360 
otherwise you know it depends on the

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.640 
otherwise you know it depends on the
sound<00:04:00.480> you<00:04:00.630> want<00:04:00.660> but<00:04:01.110> if<00:04:01.170> you<00:04:01.230> want<00:04:01.410> to<00:04:01.530> you

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
sound you want but if you want to you

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.160 
sound you want but if you want to you
could<00:04:01.770> flip<00:04:01.980> it<00:04:02.040> down<00:04:02.750> and<00:04:03.750> you<00:04:03.840> get<00:04:03.990> the<00:04:04.050> kind

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
could flip it down and you get the kind

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:10.070 
could flip it down and you get the kind
of<00:04:04.320> really<00:04:04.530> thin<00:04:05.070> tone<00:04:06.000> right<00:04:08.810> now<00:04:09.810> the<00:04:09.870> other

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
of really thin tone right now the other

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.570 
of really thin tone right now the other
interesting<00:04:10.260> thing<00:04:10.800> that<00:04:10.950> I'm<00:04:11.040> doing<00:04:11.310> is<00:04:11.430> I'm

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
interesting thing that I'm doing is I'm

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.310 
interesting thing that I'm doing is I'm
also<00:04:11.730> using<00:04:11.910> my<00:04:12.180> tone<00:04:12.450> knob<00:04:12.720> to<00:04:12.959> give<00:04:13.080> me<00:04:13.170> some

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:13.320 
also using my tone knob to give me some

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.680 
also using my tone knob to give me some
tone<00:04:13.560> so<00:04:13.830> I<00:04:14.040> don't<00:04:14.580> have<00:04:14.760> the<00:04:14.910> tone<00:04:15.180> all<00:04:15.510> the

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
tone so I don't have the tone all the

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.509 
tone so I don't have the tone all the
way<00:04:15.780> bright<00:04:16.109> if<00:04:16.380> I<00:04:16.500> go<00:04:16.799> all<00:04:17.010> the<00:04:17.100> way<00:04:17.130> up<00:04:17.340> like

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
way bright if I go all the way up like

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.500 
way bright if I go all the way up like
this

get a little bit different sound but
generally<00:04:48.760> that's<00:04:49.090> the<00:04:49.360> settings<00:04:49.720> I<00:04:49.840> use<00:04:49.870> for

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320

generally that's the settings I use for
my<00:04:50.410> clean<00:04:50.770> channel<00:04:51.310> and<00:04:52.440> you<00:04:53.440> can<00:04:53.620> do<00:04:53.770> the<00:04:53.890> same

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
my clean channel and you can do the same

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.860 
my clean channel and you can do the same
thing<00:04:54.370> on<00:04:54.460> your<00:04:54.670> ramp<00:04:54.880> of<00:04:55.030> course<00:04:55.240> this<00:04:55.450> you

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
thing on your ramp of course this you

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.090 
thing on your ramp of course this you
know<00:04:56.020> unless<00:04:56.320> you<00:04:56.440> have<00:04:56.530> a<00:04:56.590> marshal<00:04:56.950> it's

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
know unless you have a marshal it's

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.050 
know unless you have a marshal it's
going<00:04:57.340> to<00:04:57.430> look<00:04:57.490> a<00:04:57.610> bit<00:04:57.760> a<00:04:57.790> little<00:04:57.910> bit

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.560 
going to look a bit a little bit
different<00:04:58.480> but<00:04:58.960> that's<00:04:59.200> generally<00:04:59.920> the<00:05:00.100> idea

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
different but that's generally the idea

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.210
