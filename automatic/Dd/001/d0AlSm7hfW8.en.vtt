three<00:02:37.560> ounces<00:02:37.709> or<00:02:38.069> so<00:02:38.099> at<00:02:38.580> a<00:02:38.640> meal<00:02:38.959> and<00:02:39.959> then

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
three ounces or so at a meal and then

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:41.990 
three ounces or so at a meal and then
what<00:02:40.769> I'm<00:02:40.860> going<00:02:40.980> to<00:02:41.069> do<00:02:41.250> is<00:02:41.459> just<00:02:41.670> take<00:02:41.819> half

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
what I'm going to do is just take half

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.170 
what I'm going to do is just take half
of<00:02:42.209> my<00:02:42.299> seasonings<00:02:42.810> and<00:02:43.849> sprinkle<00:02:44.849> that<00:02:44.970> over

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
of my seasonings and sprinkle that over

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.990 
of my seasonings and sprinkle that over
the<00:02:45.690> fish<00:02:46.170> so<00:02:46.829> I<00:02:47.159> just<00:02:47.819> I'm<00:02:48.120> using<00:02:48.329> a<00:02:48.540> spoon<00:02:48.870> and

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
the fish so I just I'm using a spoon and

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.300 
the fish so I just I'm using a spoon and
right<00:02:51.000> now<00:02:51.120> I'm<00:02:51.209> adding<00:02:51.360> the<00:02:51.510> curry<00:02:51.870> powder

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
right now I'm adding the curry powder

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.710 
right now I'm adding the curry powder
and<00:02:53.310> I<00:02:53.400> think<00:02:53.579> the<00:02:53.700> curry<00:02:53.909> powder<00:02:54.150> is<00:02:54.420> a<00:02:54.450> really

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
and I think the curry powder is a really

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.380 
and I think the curry powder is a really
important<00:02:55.170> ingredient<00:02:55.379> that's<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:57.209> thing

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
important ingredient that's the thing

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.030 
important ingredient that's the thing
that<00:02:57.540> gives<00:02:57.660> it<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:57.900> most<00:02:58.170> flavor<00:02:58.560> besides

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
that gives it the most flavor besides

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.580 
that gives it the most flavor besides
the<00:02:59.190> lime<00:02:59.370> juice<00:03:00.140> and<00:03:01.140> we're<00:03:01.290> going<00:03:01.410> to<00:03:01.440> add

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
the lime juice and we're going to add

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:09.319 
the lime juice and we're going to add
the<00:03:01.769> garlic<00:03:01.920> powder<00:03:03.709> sprinkle<00:03:04.709> that<00:03:07.640> and<00:03:08.640> then

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
the garlic powder sprinkle that and then

the garlic powder sprinkle that and then
our<00:03:09.690> black<00:03:10.200> pepper<00:03:11.569> and<00:03:12.569> keep<00:03:12.900> in<00:03:13.019> mind<00:03:13.170> if

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290

pretty good the way that you can tell

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:06.280 
pretty good the way that you can tell
it's<00:06:04.370> done<00:06:04.550> is<00:06:04.760> you<00:06:04.940> take<00:06:05.240> your<00:06:05.420> spatula<00:06:05.750> and

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:06.290 
it's done is you take your spatula and

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:07.720 
it's done is you take your spatula and
you<00:06:06.380> stick<00:06:06.620> it<00:06:06.740> into<00:06:06.890> the<00:06:07.070> middle<00:06:07.310> of<00:06:07.400> the<00:06:07.490> fish

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:07.730 
you stick it into the middle of the fish

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:10.360 
you stick it into the middle of the fish
and<00:06:08.090> as<00:06:08.990> long<00:06:09.200> as<00:06:09.350> it's<00:06:09.500> white<00:06:09.890> all<00:06:10.160> the<00:06:10.250> way

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:10.370 
and as long as it's white all the way

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:11.560 
and as long as it's white all the way
through<00:06:10.640> and<00:06:10.790> then<00:06:10.850> it's<00:06:11.000> not<00:06:11.090> clear<00:06:11.390> anymore

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:11.570
