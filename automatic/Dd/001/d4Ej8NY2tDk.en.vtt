00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
you're not actually killing these mobs

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.840 
you're not actually killing these mobs
necessarily<00:01:55.710> for<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.009> reputation<00:01:56.640> you're

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
necessarily for the reputation you're

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.520 
necessarily for the reputation you're
killing<00:01:57.119> them<00:01:57.180> for<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.479> feathers<00:01:58.020> they<00:01:58.229> drop

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
killing them for the feathers they drop

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.609 
killing them for the feathers they drop
they<00:01:59.399> will<00:01:59.549> drop<00:01:59.759> one<00:02:00.600> feather<00:02:00.930> maybe<00:02:01.320> every

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
they will drop one feather maybe every

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.620 
they will drop one feather maybe every
three<00:02:01.820> every<00:02:02.820> three<00:02:03.060> mom's<00:02:03.270> if<00:02:03.509> you're

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
three every three mom's if you're

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.240 
three every three mom's if you're
unlucky<00:02:03.780> maybe<00:02:04.320> one<00:02:04.469> in<00:02:04.590> five<00:02:04.829> will<00:02:05.040> drop<00:02:05.219> a

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
unlucky maybe one in five will drop a

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.960 
unlucky maybe one in five will drop a
feather<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:05.790> then<00:02:06.390> each<00:02:06.509> feather<00:02:06.899> is<00:02:07.290> worth

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
feather and then each feather is worth

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.479 
feather and then each feather is worth

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:46.520 
quest one it's literally quicker just to

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.880

around the run around the little lake in
the<00:06:56.060> middle<00:06:56.300> there<00:06:56.450> but<00:06:56.660> again<00:06:57.470> it<00:06:57.680> it<00:06:58.160> really

00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:58.550

00:06:59.890 --> 00:06:59.900 
doesn't matter as you can see it this

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:01.900 
doesn't matter as you can see it this
video<00:07:00.080> I've<00:07:00.260> mixed<00:07:00.440> it<00:07:00.620> up<00:07:00.710> like<00:07:01.430> entirely<00:07:01.760> I

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:01.910 
video I've mixed it up like entirely I

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:03.910 
video I've mixed it up like entirely I
didn't<00:07:02.180> stick<00:07:02.390> to<00:07:02.420> one<00:07:02.740> pattern<00:07:03.740> just

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:03.920 
didn't stick to one pattern just

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.680 
didn't stick to one pattern just
performing<00:07:04.490> yet<00:07:04.670> I<00:07:04.700> don't<00:07:05.210> think<00:07:05.300> there<00:07:05.480> is<00:07:05.600> an

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:05.690 
performing yet I don't think there is an

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:08.110 
performing yet I don't think there is an
optimal<00:07:06.200> route<00:07:06.410> just<00:07:07.070> because<00:07:07.520> they<00:07:07.760> respond

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:08.120 
optimal route just because they respond

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.840 
optimal route just because they respond
so<00:07:08.270> quickly<00:07:08.630> it's<00:07:09.110> respawning<00:07:09.850> immediately

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:10.850 
so quickly it's respawning immediately

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:12.700 
so quickly it's respawning immediately
immediately<00:07:11.510> responding<00:07:11.990> I<00:07:12.110> keep<00:07:12.560> getting

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:12.710 
immediately responding I keep getting
