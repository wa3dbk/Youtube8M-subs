hello<00:00:00.960> everyone<00:00:01.589> this<00:00:01.920> video<00:00:02.310> is<00:00:02.460> a<00:00:02.490> follow-up

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
hello everyone this video is a follow-up

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.900 
hello everyone this video is a follow-up
to<00:00:03.210> my<00:00:03.360> Bethlehem<00:00:03.990> star<00:00:04.410> video<00:00:04.799> I<00:00:05.100> had<00:00:05.580> a<00:00:05.609> few

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
to my Bethlehem star video I had a few

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.909 
to my Bethlehem star video I had a few
people<00:00:06.150> that<00:00:06.390> asked<00:00:06.750> me<00:00:06.960> to<00:00:07.170> explain<00:00:07.649> things

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
people that asked me to explain things

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.129 
people that asked me to explain things
through<00:00:08.340> the<00:00:08.460> video<00:00:08.820> and<00:00:09.090> I'm<00:00:09.540> gonna<00:00:09.719> do<00:00:09.929> that

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
through the video and I'm gonna do that

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.209 
through the video and I'm gonna do that
in<00:00:10.349> this<00:00:10.530> video

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
in this video

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.910 
in this video
the<00:00:12.210> first<00:00:12.509> thing<00:00:12.719> I<00:00:12.840> want<00:00:13.049> to<00:00:13.110> talk<00:00:13.320> about<00:00:13.530> is

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
the first thing I want to talk about is

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.760 
the first thing I want to talk about is
retrograde<00:00:14.700> motion<00:00:14.940> and<00:00:15.750> we're<00:00:15.990> going<00:00:16.379> to<00:00:16.529> use

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
retrograde motion and we're going to use

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.269 
retrograde motion and we're going to use
Earth<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.550> Mars<00:00:17.970> as<00:00:18.390> an<00:00:18.900> example<00:00:19.350> and<00:00:19.800> how

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
Earth and Mars as an example and how

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.700 
Earth and Mars as an example and how
earth<00:00:20.609> moves<00:00:21.090> around<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.510> Sun<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.199> the

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
earth moves around the Sun and the

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.679 
earth moves around the Sun and the
relation<00:00:23.279> that<00:00:23.310> Mars<00:00:23.730> has<00:00:24.090> against<00:00:24.600> the

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
relation that Mars has against the

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.480 
relation that Mars has against the
background<00:00:25.170> stars<00:00:25.590> that<00:00:25.859> would<00:00:25.949> be<00:00:26.130> over<00:00:26.310> here

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
background stars that would be over here

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.330 
background stars that would be over here
and<00:00:26.939> how<00:00:27.090> it<00:00:27.269> moves<00:00:27.570> as<00:00:28.500> earth<00:00:28.920> moves<00:00:29.220> around

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
and how it moves as earth moves around

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.700 
and how it moves as earth moves around
the<00:00:29.609> Sun<00:00:29.670> it<00:00:30.090> moves<00:00:30.300> faster<00:00:30.900> than<00:00:30.929> Mars<00:00:31.349> and

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
the Sun it moves faster than Mars and

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.720 
the Sun it moves faster than Mars and
Mars<00:00:32.340> appears<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.899> stop<00:00:34.290> go<00:00:35.010> into<00:00:35.280> retrograde

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
Mars appears to stop go into retrograde

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.869 
Mars appears to stop go into retrograde
motion<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.719> then<00:00:36.930> stop<00:00:37.290> again<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:38.070> then<00:00:38.610> move

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
motion and then stop again and then move

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.540 
motion and then stop again and then move
into<00:00:39.120> direct<00:00:39.719> motion<00:00:40.230> this<00:00:40.890> is<00:00:40.950> just<00:00:41.399> an

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
into direct motion this is just an

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.450 
into direct motion this is just an
optical<00:00:42.180> illusion<00:00:42.559> however<00:00:43.559> this<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.190> one<00:00:44.430> of

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
optical illusion however this is one of

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.670 
optical illusion however this is one of
the<00:00:44.640> ways<00:00:44.850> God<00:00:45.270> shows<00:00:45.660> us<00:00:45.870> signs<00:00:46.200> in<00:00:46.559> the

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
the ways God shows us signs in the

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.630 
the ways God shows us signs in the
heavens<00:00:47.210> in<00:00:48.210> my<00:00:48.570> video<00:00:48.960> Bethlehem<00:00:49.680> star<00:00:50.070> it

heavens in my video Bethlehem star it

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.029 
heavens in my video Bethlehem star it
begins<00:00:51.149> with<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.629> moon<00:00:51.870> eclipsing<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.649> star

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
begins with the moon eclipsing the star

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.279 
begins with the moon eclipsing the star
regulus<00:00:53.730> which<00:00:54.300> is<00:00:54.449> right<00:00:54.660> in<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:54.899> middle<00:00:54.930> of

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
regulus which is right in the middle of

your screen less than a month later we

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.400 
your screen less than a month later we
have<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.039> solar<00:00:59.489> eclipse<00:00:59.640> and<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.660> did<00:01:00.960> not<00:01:01.109> show

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
have a solar eclipse and I did not show

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.590 
have a solar eclipse and I did not show
that<00:01:01.440> in<00:01:01.890> Bethlehem<00:01:02.129> star<00:01:02.820> because<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.390> was

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
that in Bethlehem star because it was

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.410 
that in Bethlehem star because it was
not<00:01:03.840> visible<00:01:04.320> in<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.890> middle<00:01:05.189> east<00:01:05.339> in<00:01:06.210> the

not visible in the middle east in the
upper<00:01:06.689> right<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:07.110> see<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.350> conjunction

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
upper right you see a conjunction

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.039 
upper right you see a conjunction
between<00:01:08.280> Jupiter<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.180> Venus<00:01:09.240> the

between Jupiter and Venus the

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.690 
between Jupiter and Venus the
conjunction<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:10.830> just<00:01:11.100> when<00:01:11.280> two<00:01:11.520> or<00:01:11.640> more

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
conjunction is just when two or more

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.539 
conjunction is just when two or more
planets<00:01:12.600> get<00:01:12.990> close<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.470> each<00:01:13.530> other<00:01:13.799> or<00:01:14.100> close

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
Jupiter and Venus is going to start two

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.190 
Jupiter and Venus is going to start two
different<00:01:20.400> signs<00:01:20.640> at<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:20.970> same<00:01:21.240> time<00:01:21.509> we're

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
different signs at the same time we're

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.899 
different signs at the same time we're
gonna<00:01:22.320> watch<00:01:22.560> Venus<00:01:23.130> go<00:01:23.460> down<00:01:23.670> and<00:01:23.820> get

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
gonna watch Venus go down and get

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.480 
gonna watch Venus go down and get
circled<00:01:24.450> by<00:01:24.600> mercury<00:01:25.200> the<00:01:25.409> messenger<00:01:25.490> which

circled by mercury the messenger which
is<00:01:26.670> what<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.030> Magi<00:01:27.570> saw<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:28.229> know<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:28.860> was

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
is what the Magi saw to know that it was

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.520 
is what the Magi saw to know that it was
his<00:01:29.369> star<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.270> we're<00:01:30.810> also<00:01:30.960> gonna<00:01:31.229> watch

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
his star and we're also gonna watch

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.249 
his star and we're also gonna watch
Jupiter<00:01:32.189> which<00:01:32.700> is<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.060> king<00:01:33.299> wandering<00:01:33.900> star

he's gonna pass Regulus the King star

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.140 
he's gonna pass Regulus the King star
he's<00:01:37.530> going<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.799> go<00:01:37.950> into<00:01:38.189> retrograde<00:01:38.909> motion

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
he's going to go into retrograde motion

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.230 
he's going to go into retrograde motion
past<00:01:40.049> Regulus<00:01:40.680> again<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.340> then<00:01:41.579> go<00:01:41.759> back<00:01:41.970> into
