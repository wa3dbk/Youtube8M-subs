the first one was easy this one's a lot

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.189 
the first one was easy this one's a lot
more<00:00:14.250> difficult<00:00:14.700> but<00:00:14.790> we<00:00:14.969> need<00:00:15.150> to<00:00:15.240> do<00:00:15.420> is<00:00:15.630> get

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
more difficult but we need to do is get

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.140 
more difficult but we need to do is get
power<00:00:16.500> to<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.890> light<00:00:17.400> board<00:00:17.609> over<00:00:17.910> there<00:00:18.029> we

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
power to the light board over there we

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.700 
power to the light board over there we
got<00:00:18.240> to<00:00:18.359> do<00:00:18.449> that<00:00:18.600> by<00:00:18.779> getting<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:19.170> Batmobile

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
got to do that by getting the Batmobile

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.460 
got to do that by getting the Batmobile
up<00:00:19.949> over<00:00:20.250> there<00:00:20.520> to<00:00:21.029> generate<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.689> power<00:00:21.840> to

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
up over there to generate the power to

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.650 
up over there to generate the power to
turn<00:00:22.920> on<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.279> lights<00:00:23.490> over<00:00:23.699> here<00:00:23.820> so<00:00:24.240> there's

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
turn on the lights over here so there's

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.120 
turn on the lights over here so there's
a<00:00:24.750> lot<00:00:24.810> of<00:00:25.080> little<00:00:25.410> things<00:00:25.439> that<00:00:25.740> we<00:00:25.920> need<00:00:26.099> to

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
a lot of little things that we need to

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.189 
a lot of little things that we need to
do<00:00:26.340> so<00:00:26.550> first<00:00:26.880> we're<00:00:27.150> gonna<00:00:27.210> kind<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:27.630> make<00:00:28.019> our

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
do so first we're gonna kind of make our

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.410 
do so first we're gonna kind of make our
way<00:00:28.349> up<00:00:28.380> over<00:00:28.830> here<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.490> then<00:00:30.029> there's<00:00:30.240> going

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
way up over here and then there's going

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.139 
way up over here and then there's going
to<00:00:30.510> be<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.779> switch<00:00:31.320> here<00:00:31.769> that<00:00:32.340> will<00:00:32.550> extend<00:00:32.969> the

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
to be a switch here that will extend the

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.360 
to be a switch here that will extend the
platform<00:00:33.410> just<00:00:34.410> above<00:00:34.710> over<00:00:35.040> there<00:00:35.190> with<00:00:35.340> a

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
platform just above over there with a

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.690 
platform just above over there with a
question<00:00:35.579> mark<00:00:36.030> on<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.840> we<00:00:37.440> got<00:00:37.649> to<00:00:37.800> be

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
question mark on it and we got to be

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.569 
question mark on it and we got to be
careful<00:00:38.940> here<00:00:39.300> with<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.540> red<00:00:39.780> in<00:00:40.050> white

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:40.579 
careful here with the red in white

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:43.330 
careful here with the red in white
blocks<00:00:41.579> there<00:00:41.910> you<00:00:42.210> can<00:00:42.450> toggle<00:00:42.719> those

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
blocks there you can toggle those

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.950 
blocks there you can toggle those
forward<00:00:44.340> or<00:00:44.489> back<00:00:44.700> using<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.180> circle<00:00:45.719> button

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
forward or back using the circle button

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.340 
forward or back using the circle button
so<00:00:46.649> what<00:00:46.860> we<00:00:46.950> need<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.219> do<00:00:47.430> is<00:00:47.610> get<00:00:47.789> that<00:00:47.940> white

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
so what we need to do is get that white

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.319 
so what we need to do is get that white
block<00:00:49.350> right<00:00:49.680> there<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:50.070> my<00:00:50.190> left<00:00:50.329> underneath

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
block right there to my left underneath

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.350 
block right there to my left underneath
this<00:00:51.840> platform<00:00:52.190> and<00:00:53.190> then<00:00:53.670> what<00:00:53.969> we<00:00:54.090> need<00:00:54.270> to

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
this platform and then what we need to

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.540 
this platform and then what we need to
do<00:00:54.510> is<00:00:54.660> get<00:00:54.809> out<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.350> Batmobile<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:56.250> step

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
do is get out of the Batmobile and step

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.060 
do is get out of the Batmobile and step
on<00:00:56.760> this<00:00:57.030> green<00:00:57.420> switch<00:00:58.170> over<00:00:58.469> here<00:00:58.500> that'll

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
on this green switch over here that'll

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.580 
on this green switch over here that'll
deactivate<00:00:59.910> this<00:01:00.090> little<00:01:00.510> red<00:01:00.719> pad<00:01:01.020> over<00:01:01.410> here

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
deactivate this little red pad over here

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.189 
deactivate this little red pad over here
to<00:01:01.710> my<00:01:01.859> left<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:02.280> my<00:01:02.489> Batmobile<00:01:03.090> is<00:01:03.329> about<00:01:04.019> to

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
to my left that my Batmobile is about to

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.080 
to my left that my Batmobile is about to
go<00:01:04.409> drive<00:01:04.799> up<00:01:05.010> over<00:01:05.339> so<00:01:05.489> we're<00:01:05.640> gonna<00:01:05.729> use<00:01:05.939> the

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
go drive up over so we're gonna use the

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.200 
go drive up over so we're gonna use the
remote<00:01:06.390> control<00:01:06.770> Batmobile<00:01:07.770> here<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.700> this

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
remote control Batmobile here and this

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.990 
remote control Batmobile here and this
little<00:01:09.450> light<00:01:09.750> pad<00:01:10.260> is<00:01:10.470> off<00:01:10.650> that<00:01:10.710> would<00:01:11.280> take

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
little light pad is off that would take

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.630 
little light pad is off that would take
the<00:01:12.270> platform<00:01:12.720> in<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.500> we<00:01:13.619> need<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:14.220> use<00:01:14.460> your

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
the platform in that we need so use your

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.270 
the platform in that we need so use your
toggle<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.360> make<00:01:16.049> these<00:01:16.229> red<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.830> white

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
toggle and make these red and white

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.060 
toggle and make these red and white
blocks<00:01:18.119> here<00:01:18.479> just<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.259> be<00:01:19.650> at<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.890> right

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
blocks here just to be at the right

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.590 
blocks here just to be at the right
position<00:01:20.369> for<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.060> make<00:01:21.210> your<00:01:21.360> way<00:01:21.390> across

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
position for you to make your way across

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.870 
position for you to make your way across
now<00:01:22.229> we<00:01:22.290> have<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.860> make<00:01:23.009> this<00:01:23.220> jump<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.729> this

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
now we have to make this jump and this

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.670 
now we have to make this jump and this
is<00:01:24.030> kind<00:01:24.240> of<00:01:24.299> tricky<00:01:24.630> so<00:01:24.900> we<00:01:25.290> have<00:01:25.409> this<00:01:25.500> little

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
is kind of tricky so we have this little

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.530 
is kind of tricky so we have this little
white<00:01:25.950> black<00:01:26.280> here<00:01:26.580> that<00:01:26.729> we<00:01:26.850> need<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.180> make<00:01:27.360> go

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
white black here that we need to make go

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.840 
white black here that we need to make go
in<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:28.409> we<00:01:28.590> also<00:01:28.740> have<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.950> red<00:01:29.220> one<00:01:29.400> so<00:01:29.610> we<00:01:29.729> need

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
in and we also have a red one so we need

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.760 
in and we also have a red one so we need
to<00:01:29.939> make<00:01:30.090> sure<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.420> ramp<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:31.049> sitting<00:01:31.409> on<00:01:31.530> top

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
to make sure the ramp is sitting on top

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:32.870 
to make sure the ramp is sitting on top
of<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.070> red<00:01:32.340> one

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
of the red one

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.760 
of the red one
so<00:01:33.210> again<00:01:33.420> toggle<00:01:33.930> with<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.200> circle<00:01:34.560> button

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
so again toggle with the circle button

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.030 
so again toggle with the circle button
and<00:01:35.070> then<00:01:35.909> what<00:01:36.119> we<00:01:36.210> need<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.479> do<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.960> back<00:01:37.740> up

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
and then what we need to do is back up

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.600 
and then what we need to do is back up
and<00:01:38.280> I'm<00:01:38.369> going<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:39.710> make<00:01:40.710> sure<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:40.920> get<00:01:41.040> my<00:01:41.220> red

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.899 
thing there there we go so I'm gonna
boost<00:01:43.799> over<00:01:44.220> here<00:01:44.460> I'm<00:01:44.579> gonna<00:01:44.700> hit<00:01:44.880> my

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
boost over here I'm gonna hit my

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.760 
boost over here I'm gonna hit my
thruster<00:01:45.600> with<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.869> triangle<00:01:46.350> button<00:01:46.560> and

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
thruster with the triangle button and

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.359 
thruster with the triangle button and
the<00:01:47.070> in<00:01:47.220> mid<00:01:47.549> jump<00:01:48.030> I<00:01:48.240> have<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.780> toggle<00:01:49.020> the

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
the in mid jump I have to toggle the

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.480 
the in mid jump I have to toggle the
platforms<00:01:50.369> so<00:01:51.000> I'm<00:01:51.149> gonna<00:01:51.420> boost<00:01:52.409> up<00:01:52.649> here<00:01:53.040> and

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
platforms so I'm gonna boost up here and

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.889 
platforms so I'm gonna boost up here and
then<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.670> got<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.850> toggle<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.299> platform<00:01:54.780> it

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
then I got a toggle the platform it

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:55.639 
then I got a toggle the platform it
wasn't<00:01:55.290> pretty

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
wasn't pretty

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.069 
wasn't pretty
but<00:01:56.159> I<00:01:56.189> made<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.490> over<00:01:56.850> so<00:01:57.420> now<00:01:57.570> all<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:57.869> got<00:01:57.990> to

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
but I made it over so now all you got to

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.950 
but I made it over so now all you got to
do<00:01:58.259> is<00:01:58.560> use<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.070> winch<00:01:59.310> here<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.420> we're<00:02:00.659> going

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
do is use the winch here and we're going

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.429 
do is use the winch here and we're going
to<00:02:01.259> rev<00:02:02.130> up<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.549> engine<00:02:03.149> here<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.630> that'll

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
to rev up the engine here and that'll

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.980 
to rev up the engine here and that'll
give<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.890> power<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.790> light<00:02:06.240> board<00:02:06.570> over

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
give the power to the light board over

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.340 
give the power to the light board over
there

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
there

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.190 
there
so<00:02:08.039> Catwoman<00:02:08.640> can<00:02:08.819> find<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.239> proper<00:02:09.690> key<00:02:09.899> just

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
so Catwoman can find the proper key just

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.870 
so Catwoman can find the proper key just
like<00:02:10.379> in<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.619> first<00:02:10.860> one

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
like in the first one

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.720 
like in the first one
so<00:02:12.720> a<00:02:12.750> lot<00:02:12.990> of<00:02:13.110> little<00:02:13.500> things<00:02:13.770> here<00:02:14.430> but<00:02:14.610> it's

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
so a lot of little things here but it's

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.490 
so a lot of little things here but it's
not<00:02:14.880> too<00:02:15.210> difficult<00:02:15.450> but<00:02:16.110> this<00:02:16.230> is<00:02:16.380> only

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
not too difficult but this is only

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.110 
not too difficult but this is only
number<00:02:16.770> two<00:02:17.070> so<00:02:17.220> I<00:02:17.250> imagine<00:02:17.490> I'm<00:02:17.820> gonna<00:02:17.880> get

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
number two so I imagine I'm gonna get

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.450 
number two so I imagine I'm gonna get
much<00:02:18.330> more<00:02:18.600> difficult<00:02:19.170> so<00:02:19.860> get<00:02:20.040> both<00:02:20.220> of<00:02:20.250> your

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
much more difficult so get both of your

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.370 
much more difficult so get both of your
wheels<00:02:20.700> on<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.300> both<00:02:21.450> of<00:02:21.630> these<00:02:21.720> light<00:02:22.080> pads

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
wheels on the both of these light pads

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.070 
wheels on the both of these light pads
here<00:02:22.710> and<00:02:22.860> it'll<00:02:23.010> light<00:02:23.250> up<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:24.510> board<00:02:24.780> there

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
here and it'll light up the board there

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.110 
here and it'll light up the board there
and<00:02:25.590> you<00:02:25.650> can<00:02:25.800> see<00:02:25.980> it's<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.250> bottom-left<00:02:26.820> one

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
and you can see it's the bottom-left one

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.390 
and you can see it's the bottom-left one
so<00:02:27.300> I'm<00:02:27.390> gonna<00:02:27.510> go<00:02:27.660> switch<00:02:27.990> the<00:02:28.320> catwoman<00:02:29.160> here

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
so I'm gonna go switch the catwoman here

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.090 
so I'm gonna go switch the catwoman here
and<00:02:29.700> then<00:02:30.630> we're<00:02:30.870> going<00:02:31.110> to<00:02:31.200> hope<00:02:31.500> we<00:02:31.740> pick<00:02:31.950> the

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
and then we're going to hope we pick the

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.170 
and then we're going to hope we pick the
right<00:02:32.280> key<00:02:32.460> and<00:02:32.490> if<00:02:32.700> you<00:02:32.760> don't<00:02:32.940> pick<00:02:33.030> the

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
right key and if you don't pick the

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.280 
right key and if you don't pick the
right<00:02:33.330> key<00:02:33.510> by<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:33.720> way<00:02:33.870> there<00:02:34.170> was<00:02:34.260> a

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
right key by the way there was a

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.380 
right key by the way there was a
checkpoint<00:02:34.620> so<00:02:35.040> you<00:02:35.100> can<00:02:35.280> just<00:02:35.520> keep<00:02:36.000> trying

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
checkpoint so you can just keep trying

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.420 
checkpoint so you can just keep trying
trial<00:02:36.960> and<00:02:37.260> error<00:02:37.470> and<00:02:37.680> you'll<00:02:38.190> eventually

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
trial and error and you'll eventually

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.050 
trial and error and you'll eventually
figure<00:02:38.910> out<00:02:39.180> which<00:02:39.330> one<00:02:39.540> it<00:02:39.690> is<00:02:39.720> so<00:02:40.880> I'm<00:02:41.880> going

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
figure out which one it is so I'm going

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.760 
figure out which one it is so I'm going
over<00:02:42.180> here<00:02:42.300> and<00:02:42.570> it<00:02:42.960> happens<00:02:43.320> to<00:02:43.440> be<00:02:43.500> this

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
over here and it happens to be this

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.610 
over here and it happens to be this
display<00:02:44.220> case<00:02:44.250> here

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
display case here
