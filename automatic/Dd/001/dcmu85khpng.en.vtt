seems<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.219> be<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.939> only<00:01:57.180> one<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:57.479> I<00:01:57.750> can<00:01:57.930> see

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
seems to be the only one that I can see

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.080 
seems to be the only one that I can see
myself<00:01:58.259> doing<00:01:58.530> even<00:01:59.040> when<00:01:59.159> I'm<00:01:59.280> 60<00:01:59.670> years<00:01:59.700> old

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
myself doing even when I'm 60 years old

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.630 
myself doing even when I'm 60 years old
it<00:02:00.659> doesn't<00:02:01.110> require<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.409> high<00:02:01.799> kicks<00:02:02.280> and

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
it doesn't require the high kicks and

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.459 
it doesn't require the high kicks and
the<00:02:02.850> flexibility<00:02:03.570> that<00:02:03.600> some<00:02:04.020> arts<00:02:04.350> like

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
the flexibility that some arts like

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.280 
the flexibility that some arts like
Taekwondo<00:02:05.100> or<00:02:05.130> others<00:02:05.579> may<00:02:05.790> may<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.659> require

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
Taekwondo or others may may and require

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.920 
Taekwondo or others may may and require
so<00:02:07.590> I<00:02:07.649> feel<00:02:07.890> that's<00:02:08.129> really<00:02:08.429> versatile

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:10.930 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.660 

instead<00:02:11.930> the<00:02:12.170> ninjas<00:02:12.560> have<00:02:12.740> a<00:02:12.920> wide<00:02:13.370> variety

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
instead the ninjas have a wide variety

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.730 
instead the ninjas have a wide variety
of<00:02:14.090> weapons<00:02:14.390> they<00:02:14.780> can<00:02:14.840> use<00:02:15.260> to<00:02:15.590> defend

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740

themself the blade is shorter okay then

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.020 
themself the blade is shorter okay then
