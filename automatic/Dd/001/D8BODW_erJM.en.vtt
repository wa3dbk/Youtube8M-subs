wanted to talk to you guys about motes

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.579 
wanted to talk to you guys about motes
of<00:00:06.180> light<00:00:06.240> for<00:00:06.600> those<00:00:06.720> who<00:00:06.870> didn't<00:00:07.230> know<00:00:07.259> you

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
of light for those who didn't know you

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.259 
of light for those who didn't know you
actually<00:00:07.919> can<00:00:08.220> gain<00:00:08.429> a<00:00:08.460> mode<00:00:08.670> of<00:00:08.700> light<00:00:08.970> from

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
actually can gain a mode of light from

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.030 
actually can gain a mode of light from
gaining<00:00:09.660> experience<00:00:10.050> as<00:00:10.500> it<00:00:10.650> says<00:00:10.830> right<00:00:10.860> here

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
gaining experience as it says right here

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.930 
gaining experience as it says right here
Ernie<00:00:11.759> XP<00:00:12.150> now<00:00:12.360> creates<00:00:12.719> a<00:00:12.840> mode<00:00:12.990> of<00:00:13.019> light<00:00:13.320> I'm

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:13.940 
Ernie XP now creates a mode of light I'm

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.820 
Ernie XP now creates a mode of light I'm
about<00:00:14.940> three-fourths<00:00:15.570> away<00:00:15.870> there<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.410> I've

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
about three-fourths away there and I've

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.950 
about three-fourths away there and I've
only<00:00:16.980> gotten<00:00:17.279> about<00:00:17.520> 11,000<00:00:18.150> experience<00:00:18.750> so

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
only gotten about 11,000 experience so

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.740 
only gotten about 11,000 experience so
in<00:00:19.109> my<00:00:19.230> calculation<00:00:19.949> 34<00:00:20.490> is<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.670> 11,000<00:00:21.300> it's

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
in my calculation 34 is the 11,000 it's

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.120 
in my calculation 34 is the 11,000 it's
probably<00:00:22.020> roughly<00:00:22.170> around<00:00:22.320> fifteen<00:00:22.740> sixteen

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
probably roughly around fifteen sixteen

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.250 
probably roughly around fifteen sixteen
thousand<00:00:23.580> for<00:00:24.300> each<00:00:24.510> mode<00:00:24.689> of<00:00:24.810> light<00:00:24.990> I<00:00:25.019> don't

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
thousand for each mode of light I don't

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.450 
thousand for each mode of light I don't
know<00:00:25.350> if<00:00:25.470> it<00:00:25.590> gets<00:00:25.769> increasingly<00:00:26.160> more

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
know if it gets increasingly more

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.339 
know if it gets increasingly more
difficult<00:00:26.519> I<00:00:27.000> really<00:00:27.599> assume<00:00:27.840> it<00:00:28.019> stays<00:00:28.170> the

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
difficult I really assume it stays the

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.970 
difficult I really assume it stays the
same<00:00:29.779> Thursday<00:00:30.779> afternoon<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:31.529> didn't<00:00:31.859> have

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
same Thursday afternoon I didn't have

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.530 
same Thursday afternoon I didn't have
any<00:00:32.160> motive<00:00:32.489> light<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:32.850> now<00:00:32.969> I<00:00:33.000> have<00:00:33.270> 11

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
any motive light and now I have 11

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.030 
any motive light and now I have 11
multiplied<00:00:34.050> tonight<00:00:34.290> gotten<00:00:34.590> all<00:00:34.739> of<00:00:34.770> this

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
multiplied tonight gotten all of this

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.880 
multiplied tonight gotten all of this
just<00:00:35.280> from<00:00:35.399> playing<00:00:35.579> crucible<00:00:36.530> and<00:00:37.530> this<00:00:37.739> is

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
just from playing crucible and this is

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.560 
just from playing crucible and this is
just<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.520> experience<00:00:38.730> is<00:00:39.120> what<00:00:39.270> gave<00:00:39.420> me<00:00:39.450> the

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
just the experience is what gave me the

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.920 
just the experience is what gave me the
modes<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:39.899> light<00:00:40.079> I've<00:00:40.559> gotten<00:00:41.930> actually

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
modes of light I've gotten actually

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.389 
modes of light I've gotten actually
instead<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.290> that<00:00:43.410> I've<00:00:43.590> gotten<00:00:43.920> one<00:00:44.160> mode<00:00:44.370> of

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
instead of that I've gotten one mode of

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.459 
instead of that I've gotten one mode of
light<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:44.969> in<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.180> Senate<00:00:45.360> shard<00:00:45.719> from<00:00:45.960> a

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
light and in the Senate shard from a

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.440 
light and in the Senate shard from a
world<00:00:46.770> event<00:00:46.950> now<00:00:47.610> when<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:47.850> do<00:00:48.030> your<00:00:48.210> daily

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
world event now when you do your daily

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.420 
world event now when you do your daily
world<00:00:48.719> event<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.260> you<00:00:49.350> go<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.710> postmaster

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
world event and you go to the postmaster

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.369 
world event and you go to the postmaster
back<00:00:50.610> in<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.850> tower<00:00:51.059> you<00:00:51.809> can<00:00:51.960> actually<00:00:52.230> have

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
back in the tower you can actually have

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.600 
back in the tower you can actually have
a<00:00:52.410> chance<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.829> receive<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.129> mode<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.370> light<00:00:53.579> I

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
a chance to receive a mode of light I

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.360 
a chance to receive a mode of light I
think<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.059> might<00:00:54.989> always<00:00:55.320> receive<00:00:56.100> a<00:00:56.129> mode<00:00:56.340> of

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
think you might always receive a mode of

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.000 
think you might always receive a mode of
light<00:00:56.610> but<00:00:57.149> I'll<00:00:57.660> have<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:57.930> verify<00:00:58.410> that<00:00:58.829> and

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
light but I'll have to verify that and

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.770 
light but I'll have to verify that and
check<00:00:59.190> that<00:00:59.309> information<00:00:59.940> I've<00:01:00.420> already<00:01:00.570> got

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
check that information I've already got

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.200 
check that information I've already got
my<00:01:00.870> daily<00:01:01.170> done<00:01:01.350> so<00:01:01.530> I<00:01:01.559> can't<00:01:01.829> do<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.210> another

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
my daily done so I can't do it another

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.939 
my daily done so I can't do it another

there is a guaranteed bounty based off
where<00:01:19.170> my<00:01:19.290> experience<00:01:19.770> bar<00:01:19.920> was<00:01:20.100> right<00:01:20.340> now

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
where my experience bar was right now

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.880 
where my experience bar was right now
that<00:01:21.750> would<00:01:21.869> actually<00:01:22.020> almost<00:01:22.320> be<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.619> mode<00:01:22.860> of

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
that would actually almost be a mode of

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.580 
that would actually almost be a mode of
light<00:01:23.159> by<00:01:23.400> itself<00:01:24.080> based<00:01:25.080> off<00:01:25.290> how<00:01:25.439> much

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
light by itself based off how much

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.620 
light by itself based off how much
experience<00:01:25.710> that<00:01:26.280> is<00:01:26.460> so<00:01:27.030> another<00:01:27.479> great

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
experience that is so another great

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.660 
experience that is so another great
method<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:28.470> I've<00:01:28.619> discovered<00:01:28.979> for<00:01:29.369> actually

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
method that I've discovered for actually

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.819 
method that I've discovered for actually
doing<00:01:29.700> these<00:01:29.970> multiply<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.630> if<00:01:31.259> you<00:01:31.500> haven't

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
doing these multiply is if you haven't

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.469 
doing these multiply is if you haven't
already<00:01:31.920> done<00:01:32.369> these<00:01:32.640> missions<00:01:33.090> all<00:01:33.299> your

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
already done these missions all your

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.330 
already done these missions all your
missions<00:01:33.810> in<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:33.930> campaign<00:01:34.380> right<00:01:35.130> here<00:01:35.310> I

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
missions in the campaign right here I

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.890 
missions in the campaign right here I
have<00:01:35.520> one<00:01:35.759> last<00:01:35.970> mission<00:01:36.299> I<00:01:36.600> would<00:01:36.780> actually

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
have one last mission I would actually
