00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.840
 good friends then to be able to create 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:45.970
 this effect of rays really very 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:48.620
 simple very easy and it is a good effect 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.480
 then we are going to open our levels 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.660
 in this case and use that at the gas level 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:56.270
 but 11 this I do not know if the versions 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:59.510
 past have this effect but I 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:02.750
 imagine that yes then we open a new 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:07.180
 file file again choose the size and 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:10.220
 the shape and size and quality of the video 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.080
 then we will occupy an image of 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:16.420
 background 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.420
 black background 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.240
 stripes 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.830
 and a black background image 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.790
 you will choose 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:33.170
 which they want in this case will be of this 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.170
 we drag to the timeline 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:40.230
 and then we are going to give 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:42.450
 right click properties 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:45.610
 and we uncheck the one that says keep 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:49.090
 aspect ratio accept 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:52.060
 we stretch the duration of the 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:55.720
 image then let's right click 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:58.680
 over the line and we give in insert 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.680
 middle of the text 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.700
 and here we are going to add the text that 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.569
 want 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.569
 have the effect 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:25.070
 let's erase everything and we will put as 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.400
 this is going to be a tutorial we are going to 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.400
 put 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.490
 7 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.730
 it's fine with me 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.000
 all right 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:42.380
 then of the text medium and generated 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.640
 we're not going to stretch everything they give of the 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.640
 duration of image 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.860
 then we see the preview that 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:55.740
 is the text then we turn to 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:58.440
 the video effects tab 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:01.930
 we go and look for the effect that says 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:05.140
 x rays prize 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:08.319
 then we click and we appear two 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:12.050
 Luminance options and increases the luminance 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:15.680
 it's a minus effect of this one 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:18.770
 with less power than it has the ray 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.020
 and the high one because it has much stronger 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.640
 the color but both can serve us 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.560
 let's choose the first 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.920
 we go and drag her to the 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.920
 text 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:37.370
 then as we see, we begin to 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:41.680
 open the effect in the preview and what 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:44.230
 we want more powerful the ray 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.330
 we selected my main alpha channel 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:50.450
 and here below the options that are there 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:53.590
 below is to give you more power 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:56.860
 shine with removing 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:04:00.489
 the amount of brightness we can put 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:03.819
 much more longer shorter the 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:06.269
 where they want it 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:09.430
 and the top-down position 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:11.260
 change the color and you will see that 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.689
 they want to add 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.329
 then to be able to animate this effect 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:19.750
 we 're going to go to the button that says 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:21.940
 animal we click then we stretch the 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:25.440
 window up and up and you'll see that 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:27.760
 down here we are spoken with a rhombus 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.410
 then we have to take a point of 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.630
 origin of where we want to start a 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.210
 effect 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:37.310
 then my effect will start from 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:40.280
 left to right as you see 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.540
 here is the effect pointing towards the 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:47.020
 left 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:47.020
 then we drag this little arrow 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:55.640
 here 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:05:00.560
 then we grab where it says position x 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:02.540
 and we slowly slide the effect will see 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:05.440
 a preview as the effect also 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.440
 it is displayed 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:12.360
 ready here we formed a small dot that 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:16.240
 indicates that the animation has already been recorded 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:18.129
 now we stretch again this short 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.790
 stretch 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:23.190
 and we move 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:26.160
 and what is moving is already 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:28.490
 saved in the preview and in the 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.490
 effect 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:35.900
 all right 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:38.380
 and we move some and we can put it on 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.380
 from top to bottom 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:50.550
 and so on they can be doing 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:50.550
 the effects 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:06:01.099
 and then nothing else we give in close 

00:05:56.849 --> 00:06:01.099
 and the effects are going to be visualized 

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:06.450
 if you see the effect since you saved it 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:18.470
 so if we want it to go faster 

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:20.860
 slower we just go in between 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.860
 general 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:31.520
 sorry we're going to events 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.620
 which is to acquire an animation and if 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:36.920
 we want the effect to go faster and 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:40.220
 we only shrink the trajectory of a 

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:43.300
 point towards another this will make the effect 

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.300
 is going to call fast 

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:55.260
 and so on doing it more 

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:59.129
 fast or slower already after having 

00:06:55.260 --> 00:07:01.679
 the effect only we give the file 

00:06:59.129 --> 00:07:04.639
 and render of you choosing in the 

00:07:01.679 --> 00:07:07.439
 format the size and quality of the level 

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:09.539
 of the effect this effect says simple 

00:07:07.439 --> 00:07:13.979
 you can add it more color 

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:16.739
 brightness more lightning power study 

00:07:13.979 --> 00:07:18.599
 division of you and well this ends 

00:07:16.739 --> 00:07:22.169
 the mini tutorial I hope you have 

00:07:18.599 --> 00:07:25.439
 liked and has served you and if you liked it 

00:07:22.169 --> 00:07:29.779
 subscribe to my channel and we'll see each other 

00:07:25.439 --> 00:07:29.779
 in a new video see you soon
