00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.590
 hello friends a warm greeting from your 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.320
 Marcellus and Libyan coaches today what 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.420
 let's talk is about the myth of how 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.640
 transform muscle fat because in 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.430
 reality is a myth no no you can not 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.980
 transform muscle fat then what 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:31.410
 we have here in the health school 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:33.180
 active today we have how to make the 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.240
 myth is the grace is transformed into 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.940
 muscle actually transform the 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.829
 muscle is big and that the fat that 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.320
 is around by means of doing 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.690
 cardio ips 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.850
 cintia what happens with the change here we go 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.800
 to explain what happens when we do 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.650
 cardio one very important thing that 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.420
 let's start with the cardio combination 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.630
 Weights and nutrition to obtain 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.630
 results 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:05.820
 and with more as is the muscle the rapid is 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.030
 the muscle 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.250
 what happens when we have cardio 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.970
 we begin to melt the fat around 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:17.050
 of the muscle 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:19.300
 ok still repeating you can go riding 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.120
 bicycle makes the tics in the marcelo 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.720
 start jogging something always burdensome 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.910
 will stay 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.340
 there can be zero fat some fat 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.170
 is going to stay here then in the 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.300
 change combination 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.000
 will bring starting to melt the fat 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.830
 that is really something that happens 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.660
 the abdominals we do a lot 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.610
 called work and see you the 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:42.100
 abdominals because there is a layer 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.570
 of fat covering what we have to do 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.670
 changes for that layer of fat 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.130
 begins to be minimized and then we see the 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.680
 mouth then now I will explain the 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.210
 another part of how is this from the myth of 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.160
 that fat transforms woman 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.290
 so when we started doing cardio 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.420
 we burn the fat around us 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.729
 but you also have to do weights because 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.140
 because when we weigh we are 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.600
 working the core and we started to 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.000
 build muscle mass for example this 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.800
 is the muscle we start to make weight and 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.220
 It begins to enlarge begins to 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.440
 enlarge and what happens the muscle is 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.600
 burning what is left over 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.910
 around after the first arm 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.280
 get up to do 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.050
 Martin Fischer Court many times the 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.610
 girls who hang the fat on the 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.200
 back of the arm you have to start 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.870
 to work the muscle because equally 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.110
 no more when more muscle mass we go 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.690
 creating but but toned with a 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.790
 bodybuilder the muscle starts to 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.490
 burn the grease that is giving and is 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.170
 that's why when we exercise one 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.210
 good combination as it says ribbon 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.890
 Carlos Perez is good nutrition 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.490
 person is going to shrink but 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.770
 also at the same time going to be creating 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.420
 muscle mass but end definition 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:57.240
 definition is muscle mass 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:03:02.060
 then to go closing that is 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:09.570
 as in which people think that 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:13.310
 the fat is transformed with muscle mass 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.310
 for every pound 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.110
 throughout the world if we divide it into 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.849
 kilos would be half a kilo for each medium 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.970
 kilo of muscle mass that we 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:25.920
 we create we burn 50 extra calories at 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.200
 day because the muscle burns calories 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.910
 to keep running 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:33.700
 then to make a rich 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:37.540
 what year to melt this around is 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:39.970
 very good and what appointments to start 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.250
 tone muscle mass and that 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.780
 increase muscle mass also like this 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.790
 is burning what is around the 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.830
 muscle that way is how are we going to 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.720
 transform muscle fat that in 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.480
 actually those methods but that what 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:55.570
 happens people shrink and it gets well 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.150
 well answer get a better 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:01.570
 muscular definition as the coach 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.420
 if for something else you want to add and not 

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:06.340
 Being good does not impart good nutrition 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:08.140
 but they do these two things but not 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.040
 they have a good data feed 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:14.230
 weighed back to the junk food of 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.480
 say to the cardio the weights and the good 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.030
 feeding by government until someone 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.130
 period the period of miso gave of the day 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.870
 today you know that you can give us a 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.550
 like down there my thumb appears 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:26.980
 up to show what they 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:30.010
 liked the video and to motivate us 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:31.570
 that we continue with more ok and also not 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.330
 forget to subscribe every time 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:37.689
 subscribe to get a blue email 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:41.349
 email account that one of 

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:45.009
 the boys of active health these guys 

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:47.039
 to put in what we see in the 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:47.039
 next
