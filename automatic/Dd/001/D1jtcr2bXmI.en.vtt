Paul<00:00:03.360> you're<00:00:03.629> an<00:00:03.720> energy<00:00:04.080> efficiency<00:00:04.589> expert

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
Paul you're an energy efficiency expert

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.559 
Paul you're an energy efficiency expert
we've<00:00:05.339> worked<00:00:05.609> with<00:00:05.730> you<00:00:05.879> in<00:00:05.940> the<00:00:06.029> past<00:00:06.270> and

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
we've worked with you in the past and

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.089 
we've worked with you in the past and
we've<00:00:06.779> asked<00:00:07.080> you<00:00:07.140> back<00:00:07.319> because<00:00:07.620> we<00:00:07.859> need<00:00:08.010> you

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
we've asked you back because we need you

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:09.890 
we've asked you back because we need you
to<00:00:08.189> help<00:00:08.309> us<00:00:08.429> think<00:00:08.670> about<00:00:08.790> how<00:00:08.940> we<00:00:09.120> monitor

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
to help us think about how we monitor

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.390 
to help us think about how we monitor
the<00:00:10.080> electrical<00:00:10.469> use<00:00:10.620> in<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:10.950> house<00:00:11.099> how<00:00:11.340> do

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
the electrical use in the house how do

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.950 
the electrical use in the house how do
we<00:00:11.490> do<00:00:11.580> that<00:00:11.790> well<00:00:12.210> you<00:00:12.300> can<00:00:12.420> start<00:00:12.599> by<00:00:12.660> looking

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
we do that well you can start by looking

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.720 
we do that well you can start by looking
outside<00:00:13.139> your<00:00:13.620> house<00:00:13.769> at<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.280> electrical

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
outside your house at the electrical

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.420 
outside your house at the electrical
meter<00:00:15.330> okay<00:00:15.870> and<00:00:16.109> what<00:00:16.859> I've<00:00:16.949> got<00:00:17.100> here<00:00:17.279> is<00:00:17.340> a

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
meter okay and what I've got here is a

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.609 
meter okay and what I've got here is a
60<00:00:17.850> watt<00:00:18.000> incandescent<00:00:18.390> bulb<00:00:18.900> up<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.500> that

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
60 watt incandescent bulb up to that

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.349 
60 watt incandescent bulb up to that
meter<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.400> trick<00:00:20.760> is<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:21.150> watch<00:00:21.330> the

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
meter and the trick is to watch the

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.599 
meter and the trick is to watch the
spinning<00:00:21.900> dial<00:00:22.109> if<00:00:22.410> that<00:00:22.740> is<00:00:22.920> spinning<00:00:23.220> we<00:00:23.460> are

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
spinning dial if that is spinning we are

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:24.980 
spinning dial if that is spinning we are
drawing<00:00:23.820> electricity<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.630> it's<00:00:24.720> actually

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
drawing electricity and it's actually

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.779 
drawing electricity and it's actually
spinning<00:00:25.289> relatively<00:00:25.890> fast<00:00:26.099> right<00:00:26.460> now<00:00:26.640> I've

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
spinning relatively fast right now I've

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.359 
spinning relatively fast right now I've
got<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.000> 15<00:00:27.689> watt<00:00:27.960> compact<00:00:28.349> fluorescent<00:00:28.710> bulb

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
got a 15 watt compact fluorescent bulb

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.099 
got a 15 watt compact fluorescent bulb
on<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.550> other<00:00:29.760> side<00:00:30.029> look<00:00:30.359> at<00:00:30.449> that<00:00:30.570> slow<00:00:30.900> down

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
on the other side look at that slow down

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.410 
on the other side look at that slow down
and<00:00:31.650> so<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.279> guess<00:00:32.489> that's<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.910> trick<00:00:33.149> we<00:00:33.270> want

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
and so I guess that's the trick we want

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.270 
and so I guess that's the trick we want
to<00:00:33.480> get<00:00:33.570> that<00:00:33.690> wheel<00:00:33.899> to<00:00:34.079> spin<00:00:34.350> as<00:00:34.530> slowly<00:00:35.040> as

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
to get that wheel to spin as slowly as

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.940 
to get that wheel to spin as slowly as
possible<00:00:35.790> with<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.149> same<00:00:36.480> output<00:00:36.750> exactly<00:00:37.739> so

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
possible with the same output exactly so

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.459 
possible with the same output exactly so
in<00:00:38.129> this<00:00:38.250> case<00:00:38.460> technology<00:00:39.180> has<00:00:39.420> come<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.379> our

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
in this case technology has come to our

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.110 
in this case technology has come to our
rescue<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:41.010> we<00:00:41.100> can<00:00:41.280> use<00:00:41.460> about<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:41.730> quarter<00:00:42.090> of

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
rescue and we can use about a quarter of

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.610 
rescue and we can use about a quarter of
the<00:00:42.239> power<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.570> give<00:00:42.690> us<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:43.110> same<00:00:43.290> amount<00:00:43.559> of

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
the power to give us the same amount of

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.049 
the power to give us the same amount of
light<00:00:43.770> all<00:00:44.129> right<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:44.399> how<00:00:44.579> do<00:00:44.640> we<00:00:44.760> actually

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
light all right so how do we actually

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.180 
light all right so how do we actually
monitor<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.870> usage<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.739> individual

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
monitor the usage of individual

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.440 
monitor the usage of individual
appliances<00:00:47.610> throughout<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.000> house<00:00:48.149> well

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
appliances throughout the house well

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.779 
appliances throughout the house well
moving<00:00:48.780> inside<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.410> house<00:00:49.739> we<00:00:50.070> can<00:00:50.309> use<00:00:50.579> any

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
moving inside the house we can use any

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.850 
moving inside the house we can use any
one<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.030> these<00:00:51.239> electrical<00:00:51.960> meters<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.620> these

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
one of these electrical meters and these

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.950 
one of these electrical meters and these
are<00:00:52.980> individual<00:00:53.520> appliance<00:00:54.000> meters<00:00:54.510> they

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
are individual appliance meters they

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.470 
are individual appliance meters they
each<00:00:55.199> are<00:00:55.469> they<00:00:56.370> work<00:00:56.760> about<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.180> same<00:00:57.360> they

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
each are they work about the same they

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.750 
each are they work about the same they
have<00:00:57.629> slightly<00:00:57.870> different<00:00:58.050> features<00:00:58.680> but

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
have slightly different features but

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.520 
have slightly different features but
essentially<00:00:59.760> you<00:00:59.969> plug<00:01:00.270> your<00:01:00.600> appliance<00:01:00.809> into

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
essentially you plug your appliance into

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.139 
essentially you plug your appliance into
the<00:01:01.800> meter<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.280> plug<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.609> meter<00:01:02.789> into

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
the meter and you plug the meter into

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.490 
the meter and you plug the meter into
the<00:01:03.270> wall<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.660> they<00:01:03.719> will<00:01:03.870> tell<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.229> how<00:01:04.350> much

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
the wall and they will tell you how much

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.039 
the wall and they will tell you how much
power<00:01:04.769> or<00:01:05.070> dollars<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:06.210> appliances<00:01:06.840> using

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
power or dollars that appliances using

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.899 
power or dollars that appliances using
plug<00:01:07.470> my<00:01:07.650> refrigerator<00:01:08.189> into<00:01:08.430> this<00:01:08.610> device

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
plug my refrigerator into this device

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.850 
plug my refrigerator into this device
and<00:01:08.939> it'll<00:01:09.299> tell<00:01:09.479> me<00:01:09.540> how<00:01:10.170> much<00:01:10.320> power<00:01:10.590> and

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
and it'll tell me how much power and

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.170 
and it'll tell me how much power and
what<00:01:11.010> that<00:01:11.159> refrigerator<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.610> costing<00:01:12.000> you<00:01:12.060> to

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
what that refrigerator is costing you to

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.390 
what that refrigerator is costing you to
run<00:01:12.360> exactly<00:01:12.780> okay<00:01:13.439> so<00:01:13.710> that's<00:01:13.890> really<00:01:14.280> good

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
run exactly okay so that's really good

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.730 
run exactly okay so that's really good
information<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:15.060> guess<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.450> downside<00:01:15.570> is<00:01:16.110> you

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
information I guess the downside is you

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.289 
information I guess the downside is you
either<00:01:16.890> have<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.220> have<00:01:17.490> one<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.880> these<00:01:17.970> for

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
either have to have one of these for

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.730 
either have to have one of these for
every<00:01:18.420> appliance<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.200> want<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.409> measure<00:01:19.560> in

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
every appliance you want to measure in

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:20.990 
every appliance you want to measure in
the<00:01:19.799> house<00:01:19.979> or<00:01:20.340> when<00:01:20.490> you're<00:01:20.610> done<00:01:20.729> measuring

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
the house or when you're done measuring

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.060 
the house or when you're done measuring
the<00:01:21.210> refrigerator<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:21.960> unplug<00:01:22.650> this<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:22.890> you

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
the refrigerator you unplug this and you

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.530 
the refrigerator you unplug this and you
plug<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.369> into<00:01:23.520> your<00:01:23.670> say<00:01:23.909> washing<00:01:24.270> machine

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
plug it into your say washing machine

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.990 
plug it into your say washing machine
right<00:01:25.259> so<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.920> next<00:01:25.950> thing<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.880> might

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
right so the next thing that you might

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.310 
right so the next thing that you might
want<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.240> think<00:01:27.390> about<00:01:27.540> is<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.810> whole<00:01:28.049> house

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
want to think about is a whole house

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.990 
want to think about is a whole house
electrical<00:01:28.890> meter<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.490> there's<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.700> couple<00:01:29.880> of

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
electrical meter and there's a couple of

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.090 
electrical meter and there's a couple of
different<00:01:30.390> devices<00:01:31.259> out<00:01:31.409> on<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.680> market<00:01:31.979> now

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
different devices out on the market now

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.370 
different devices out on the market now
as<00:01:32.310> well<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:32.909> this<00:01:33.119> for<00:01:33.390> example<00:01:33.420> will<00:01:33.960> clip

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
as well so this for example will clip

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.740 
as well so this for example will clip
onto<00:01:34.590> your<00:01:35.130> power<00:01:35.640> meter<00:01:35.909> outside<00:01:36.180> and

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
onto your power meter outside and

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.569 
onto your power meter outside and
there's<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.200> little<00:01:37.380> optical<00:01:37.770> reader<00:01:37.979> that

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
there's a little optical reader that

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.429 
there's a little optical reader that
will<00:01:38.820> sense<00:01:39.270> how<00:01:39.450> fast<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:40.020> dial<00:01:40.290> is

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
will sense how fast that dial is

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.780 
will sense how fast that dial is
spinning<00:01:40.799> so<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:40.979> actually<00:01:41.250> watches<00:01:41.670> that

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
spinning so it actually watches that

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.219 
spinning so it actually watches that
dial<00:01:42.030> spin<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.540> then<00:01:42.630> what<00:01:42.720> it<00:01:42.810> sends<00:01:43.110> the

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
dial spin and then what it sends the

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.109 
dial spin and then what it sends the
information<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.829> this<00:01:43.920> monitor<00:01:44.159> exactly<00:01:44.610> and

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
information to this monitor exactly and

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.490 
information to this monitor exactly and
this<00:01:45.210> monitor<00:01:45.659> goes<00:01:45.780> inside<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.320> house<00:01:46.470> you

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
this monitor goes inside the house you

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.139 
this monitor goes inside the house you
can<00:01:46.770> carry<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.100> around<00:01:47.159> with<00:01:47.369> you<00:01:47.579> turn<00:01:47.880> things

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
can carry it around with you turn things

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.330 
can carry it around with you turn things
on<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.360> off<00:01:48.600> see<00:01:48.899> what<00:01:49.079> what<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:49.860> changes<00:01:50.220> on

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
on and off see what what it changes on

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.580 
on and off see what what it changes on
your<00:01:50.520> power<00:01:50.850> or<00:01:51.149> dollar<00:01:51.450> consumption<00:01:52.200> gadgets

this is a wireless version right here

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.760 
this is a wireless version right here
just<00:01:54.479> work<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.750> same<00:01:54.960> way<00:01:54.990> pretty<00:01:55.350> much<00:01:55.530> the

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
just work the same way pretty much the

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.980 
just work the same way pretty much the
same<00:01:55.920> way<00:01:56.130> except<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:56.579> this<00:01:56.909> clips<00:01:57.329> on<00:01:57.509> to

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
same way except that this clips on to

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.590 
same way except that this clips on to
the<00:01:58.110> wires<00:01:58.350> inside<00:01:58.979> your<00:01:59.250> panel<00:01:59.610> gadget<00:02:00.180> so<00:02:00.390> in

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
the wires inside your panel gadget so in

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.389 
the wires inside your panel gadget so in
this<00:02:00.899> case<00:02:01.229> it's<00:02:01.560> also<00:02:01.770> good<00:02:02.100> information

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
this case it's also good information

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.179 
this case it's also good information
about<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.479> whole<00:02:03.630> house<00:02:03.899> but<00:02:03.930> this<00:02:04.829> unit

what<00:02:18.900> are<00:02:18.959> we<00:02:19.019> looking<00:02:19.230> at<00:02:19.290> here<00:02:19.530> this<00:02:19.859> is<00:02:19.920> a

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
what are we looking at here this is a

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.369 
what are we looking at here this is a
breaker<00:02:20.430> box<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:21.030> we've<00:02:21.749> got<00:02:21.959> current

00:02:22.369 --> 00:02:22.379 
breaker box and we've got current

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.949 
breaker box and we've got current
sensors<00:02:22.769> that<00:02:22.950> clip<00:02:23.189> on<00:02:23.370> to<00:02:23.579> each<00:02:23.959> wire

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
sensors that clip on to each wire

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.780 
sensors that clip on to each wire
actually<00:02:25.709> so<00:02:25.769> we<00:02:25.920> monitor<00:02:26.099> each<00:02:26.400> circuit

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
actually so we monitor each circuit

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.459 
actually so we monitor each circuit
individually<00:02:27.299> so<00:02:27.629> here's<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.079> circuit<00:02:28.379> for

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:28.469 
individually so here's the circuit for

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:30.770 
individually so here's the circuit for
the<00:02:28.560> washer<00:02:28.950> machine<00:02:29.069> and<00:02:29.760> as<00:02:30.060> this<00:02:30.299> washing

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
the washer machine and as this washing

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.500 
the washer machine and as this washing
machine<00:02:30.810> draws<00:02:31.349> load<00:02:31.829> the<00:02:32.189> sensor<00:02:32.760> reads<00:02:33.209> that

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
machine draws load the sensor reads that

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.199 
machine draws load the sensor reads that
and<00:02:33.780> sends<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:34.319> information<00:02:34.469> we're<00:02:35.219> over<00:02:35.790> to

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
and sends the information we're over to

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.199 
and sends the information we're over to
this<00:02:36.829> power<00:02:37.829> management<00:02:38.219> box<00:02:38.609> that<00:02:38.879> gathers

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
this power management box that gathers

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.030 
this power management box that gathers
all<00:02:39.239> of<00:02:39.659> the<00:02:39.780> data<00:02:39.989> from<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.500> circuits<00:02:40.889> and

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
all of the data from the circuits and

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.920 
all of the data from the circuits and
sends<00:02:41.400> it<00:02:41.489> to<00:02:41.879> the<00:02:42.000> Internet<00:02:42.329> where<00:02:42.749> you<00:02:42.780> can

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
sends it to the Internet where you can

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.569 
sends it to the Internet where you can
look<00:02:43.230> at<00:02:43.409> all<00:02:43.650> of<00:02:43.680> that<00:02:43.829> data<00:02:44.099> on<00:02:44.370> your

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:44.579 
look at all of that data on your

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:47.360 
look at all of that data on your
computer<00:02:44.639> so<00:02:45.480> look<00:02:45.689> at<00:02:45.780> that<00:02:46.189> alright<00:02:47.189> we've

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
computer so look at that alright we've

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.459 
computer so look at that alright we've
actually<00:02:47.549> got<00:02:47.849> a<00:02:48.030> live<00:02:48.450> hookup<00:02:48.900> to<00:02:48.959> a<00:02:49.230> real

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:49.469 
actually got a live hookup to a real

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:52.970 
actually got a live hookup to a real
house<00:02:49.680> here<00:02:50.040> that's<00:02:50.340> using<00:02:51.349> 3122<00:02:52.349> watts<00:02:52.769> you

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
house here that's using 3122 watts you

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.409 
house here that's using 3122 watts you
can<00:02:53.099> look<00:02:53.219> at<00:02:53.310> that<00:02:53.430> Spode<00:02:53.730> ometer<00:02:54.209> on<00:02:54.329> the

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:54.419 
can look at that Spode ometer on the

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:55.939 
can look at that Spode ometer on the
left<00:02:54.629> side<00:02:54.810> there<00:02:55.109> oh<00:02:55.290> and<00:02:55.560> they're<00:02:55.680> just

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:55.949 
left side there oh and they're just

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:57.619 
left side there oh and they're just
changed<00:02:56.549> pretty<00:02:56.790> quickly<00:02:57.030> so<00:02:57.120> that<00:02:57.449> is

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
changed pretty quickly so that is

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:00.289 
changed pretty quickly so that is
actually<00:02:57.840> a<00:02:58.230> real-time<00:02:59.189> reading<00:02:59.879> of<00:03:00.090> what's

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
actually a real-time reading of what's

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:01.970 
actually a real-time reading of what's
going<00:03:00.449> on<00:03:00.659> in<00:03:00.900> the<00:03:00.989> house<00:03:01.169> that's<00:03:01.620> right<00:03:01.829> so

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
going on in the house that's right so

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.349 
going on in the house that's right so
something<00:03:02.219> somebody<00:03:02.699> just<00:03:02.879> came<00:03:03.060> home<00:03:03.299> and

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
something somebody just came home and

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:05.300 
something somebody just came home and
turned<00:03:03.719> something<00:03:04.019> on<00:03:04.260> probably<00:03:04.739> and<00:03:05.069> then

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310

santim<00:04:44.640> power<00:04:44.820> to<00:04:45.030> me<00:04:45.180> so<00:04:45.750> phantom<00:04:46.170> power<00:04:46.380> is

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
santim power to me so phantom power is

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.380 
santim power to me so phantom power is
this<00:04:46.920> idea<00:04:47.340> that<00:04:47.670> even<00:04:47.880> though<00:04:47.940> you've<00:04:48.090> turned

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.390 
this idea that even though you've turned

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.570 
this idea that even though you've turned
things<00:04:48.720> off<00:04:48.990> they're<00:04:49.380> still<00:04:49.710> drawing<00:04:50.130> a<00:04:50.400> load

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
things off they're still drawing a load

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.690 
things off they're still drawing a load
exactly<00:04:51.360> you<00:04:52.110> turn<00:04:52.350> your<00:04:52.530> computer<00:04:52.650> off<00:04:53.040> but

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
exactly you turn your computer off but

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.610 
exactly you turn your computer off but
the<00:04:53.820> printer<00:04:54.180> is<00:04:54.330> still<00:04:54.480> on<00:04:54.660> or<00:04:55.110> the<00:04:55.200> modem<00:04:55.530> is

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
the printer is still on or the modem is

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.290 
the printer is still on or the modem is
still<00:04:55.920> on<00:04:56.070> and<00:04:56.310> that's<00:04:56.460> still<00:04:56.850> using

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
still on and that's still using

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.940 
still on and that's still using
electricity<00:04:57.870> right<00:04:58.050> and<00:04:58.290> in<00:04:58.380> this<00:04:58.500> case<00:04:58.740> it's

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
electricity right and in this case it's

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.250 
electricity right and in this case it's
150<00:04:59.580> watts<00:04:59.790> it's<00:05:00.000> like<00:05:00.120> leaving<00:05:00.330> 150<00:05:01.080> watt

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:01.260 
150 watts it's like leaving 150 watt

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.320 
150 watts it's like leaving 150 watt

light bulb on all the time so this helps
us<00:05:03.450> monitor<00:05:03.720> it<00:05:04.080> how<00:05:04.290> do<00:05:04.350> we<00:05:04.440> actually<00:05:04.830> manage

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
us monitor it how do we actually manage

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.650 
us monitor it how do we actually manage
that<00:05:05.310> what<00:05:05.400> we<00:05:05.490> do<00:05:05.580> about<00:05:05.640> phantom<00:05:06.030> load<00:05:06.210> well

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
that what we do about phantom load well

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.060 
that what we do about phantom load well
we've<00:05:06.750> got<00:05:06.900> some<00:05:07.080> more<00:05:07.200> technology<00:05:07.530> fairly

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
we've got some more technology fairly

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.410 
we've got some more technology fairly
simple<00:05:08.370> to<00:05:08.460> use<00:05:08.640> let's<00:05:08.850> take<00:05:09.000> a<00:05:09.060> look<00:05:09.210> at<00:05:09.300> it

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:09.420 
simple to use let's take a look at it

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.990 
simple to use let's take a look at it
okay<00:05:09.540> power<00:05:10.410> strips<00:05:10.920> huh<00:05:11.130> right<00:05:11.430> pretty

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
okay power strips huh right pretty

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.880 
okay power strips huh right pretty
simple<00:05:12.480> to<00:05:12.540> use<00:05:12.570> plug<00:05:13.080> all<00:05:13.260> your<00:05:13.440> peripherals

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:13.890 
simple to use plug all your peripherals

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:16.340 
simple to use plug all your peripherals
in<00:05:14.070> here<00:05:14.520> when<00:05:15.210> you're<00:05:15.510> done<00:05:15.810> using<00:05:16.170> your

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
in here when you're done using your

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.710 
in here when you're done using your
equipment<00:05:16.650> you<00:05:17.010> turn<00:05:17.700> it<00:05:17.820> off<00:05:17.940> guy<00:05:18.360> everything

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
equipment you turn it off guy everything

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.450 
equipment you turn it off guy everything
goes<00:05:19.020> off<00:05:19.230> so<00:05:19.710> the<00:05:19.800> only<00:05:19.920> problem<00:05:20.280> is<00:05:20.370> that

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
goes off so the only problem is that

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.250 
goes off so the only problem is that
you've<00:05:20.580> got<00:05:20.730> to<00:05:20.820> crawl<00:05:21.090> behind<00:05:21.330> the<00:05:21.690> desk<00:05:21.960> and

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
you've got to crawl behind the desk and

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.770 
you've got to crawl behind the desk and
turn<00:05:22.440> this<00:05:22.620> off<00:05:22.830> that's<00:05:23.580> right<00:05:23.790> so<00:05:24.120> let's<00:05:24.600> get

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
turn this off that's right so let's get

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.450 
turn this off that's right so let's get
a<00:05:24.840> little<00:05:24.900> more<00:05:25.110> sophisticated<00:05:25.380> we've<00:05:26.250> got<00:05:26.430> a

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
a little more sophisticated we've got a

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.700 
a little more sophisticated we've got a
timed<00:05:26.820> power<00:05:27.210> strip<00:05:27.600> now<00:05:27.870> again<00:05:28.410> you<00:05:28.500> plug

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
timed power strip now again you plug

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.280 
timed power strip now again you plug
everything<00:05:28.950> into<00:05:29.220> this<00:05:29.340> strip<00:05:30.330> and<00:05:30.510> you

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.290 
everything into this strip and you

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:33.350 
everything into this strip and you
program<00:05:31.800> your<00:05:31.980> timer<00:05:32.280> to<00:05:32.400> turn<00:05:32.730> the<00:05:33.000> home

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:33.360 
program your timer to turn the home

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.240 
program your timer to turn the home
office<00:05:33.570> off<00:05:33.930> at<00:05:34.200> midnight<00:05:34.500> for<00:05:34.800> example

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
office off at midnight for example

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:36.500 
office off at midnight for example
everything<00:05:35.730> goes<00:05:36.000> off<00:05:36.180> while<00:05:36.390> you're

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
everything goes off while you're

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:38.060 
everything goes off while you're
sleeping<00:05:36.930> on<00:05:36.990> you<00:05:37.140> have<00:05:37.410> to<00:05:37.530> think<00:05:37.740> about<00:05:37.830> it

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
sleeping on you have to think about it

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:39.410 
sleeping on you have to think about it
all<00:05:38.160> right<00:05:38.280> but<00:05:38.580> there's<00:05:38.760> always<00:05:39.000> something

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:39.420 
all right but there's always something

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.540 
all right but there's always something
that<00:05:39.660> I<00:05:39.690> don't<00:05:39.810> want<00:05:40.020> to<00:05:40.440> stop<00:05:40.920> drawing<00:05:41.370> at

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550 
that I don't want to stop drawing at

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:42.740 
that I don't want to stop drawing at
phantom<00:05:41.880> low<00:05:42.000> because<00:05:42.180> I<00:05:42.300> don't<00:05:42.540> have<00:05:42.630> to

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
phantom low because I don't have to

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.659 
phantom low because I don't have to
reboot<00:05:43.110> it<00:05:43.290> or<00:05:43.380> reset<00:05:43.740> it<00:05:43.860> every<00:05:44.190> day<00:05:44.340> that's

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:44.669 
reboot it or reset it every day that's

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:45.950 
reboot it or reset it every day that's
right<00:05:44.880> so<00:05:45.060> you<00:05:45.090> might<00:05:45.360> want<00:05:45.540> to<00:05:45.570> consider<00:05:45.840> a

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
right so you might want to consider a

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.590 
right so you might want to consider a
controlled<00:05:46.530> power<00:05:46.830> strip<00:05:47.190> and<00:05:47.400> these<00:05:48.090> use<00:05:48.390> a

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 
controlled power strip and these use a

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.310 
controlled power strip and these use a
controlled<00:05:49.380> outlet<00:05:50.040> to<00:05:50.640> turn<00:05:50.910> these<00:05:51.750> outlets

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 
controlled outlet to turn these outlets

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.380 
controlled outlet to turn these outlets
off<00:05:52.560> so<00:05:53.250> for<00:05:53.490> example<00:05:53.820> your<00:05:53.940> computer's

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:54.390 
off so for example your computer's

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:56.480 
off so for example your computer's
plugged<00:05:54.540> in<00:05:54.810> here<00:05:55.200> and<00:05:55.380> your<00:05:55.860> monitor<00:05:56.130> and

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
plugged in here and your monitor and

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:57.770 
plugged in here and your monitor and
printer<00:05:56.640> are<00:05:56.910> plugged<00:05:57.120> in<00:05:57.240> here<00:05:57.480> when<00:05:57.660> your

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:57.780 
printer are plugged in here when your

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.440 
printer are plugged in here when your
computer<00:05:58.110> goes<00:05:58.350> off<00:05:58.590> these<00:05:59.310> outlets<00:06:00.240> are

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:00.450 
computer goes off these outlets are

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:02.150 
computer goes off these outlets are
switched<00:06:00.750> off<00:06:01.020> through<00:06:01.320> an<00:06:01.410> internal<00:06:01.770> control

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 
switched off through an internal control

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.770 
switched off through an internal control
no<00:06:02.550> phantom<00:06:03.030> load<00:06:03.180> can<00:06:03.360> come<00:06:03.510> out<00:06:03.600> of<00:06:03.660> those

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:03.780 
no phantom load can come out of those

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.330 
no phantom load can come out of those
outlets<00:06:04.110> into<00:06:04.320> the<00:06:04.470> red<00:06:04.650> ones<00:06:04.860> here

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 
outlets into the red ones here

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.820 
outlets into the red ones here
those<00:06:06.000> are<00:06:06.150> always<00:06:06.450> hot<00:06:06.630> so<00:06:07.080> your<00:06:07.260> fax<00:06:07.470> machine

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
those are always hot so your fax machine

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.320 
those are always hot so your fax machine
for<00:06:07.860> example<00:06:08.370> might<00:06:08.490> get<00:06:08.669> plugged<00:06:08.880> into<00:06:09.030> there

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 
for example might get plugged into there

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.300 
for example might get plugged into there
oh<00:06:09.510> that's<00:06:09.810> great<00:06:10.260> so<00:06:10.440> pretty<00:06:10.680> intelligent

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.310 
oh that's great so pretty intelligent

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.550 
oh that's great so pretty intelligent
all<00:06:11.669> right<00:06:11.850> so<00:06:11.970> lots<00:06:12.300> of<00:06:12.510> good<00:06:12.660> information<00:06:12.720> on

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:13.560 
all right so lots of good information on

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.710 
all right so lots of good information on
how<00:06:14.070> to<00:06:14.100> monitor<00:06:14.850> and<00:06:15.060> most<00:06:15.210> importantly<00:06:15.600> how

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:15.720 
how to monitor and most importantly how
