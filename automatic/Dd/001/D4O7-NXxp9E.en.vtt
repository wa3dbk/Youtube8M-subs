your princess is no longer in another
castle<00:03:27.630> and<00:03:28.139> what<00:03:28.440> I<00:03:28.470> explored<00:03:29.040> was<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.730> the

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
castle and what I explored was the the

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:33.229 
castle and what I explored was the the
different<00:03:31.400> the<00:03:32.400> different<00:03:32.669> marketing<00:03:33.060> that

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
different the different marketing that

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:34.879 
different the different marketing that
went<00:03:33.419> on<00:03:33.510> during<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:33.959> 80s<00:03:34.319> and<00:03:34.620> how<00:03:34.709> they

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:34.889 
went on during the 80s and how they

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:37.309 
went on during the 80s and how they
changed<00:03:35.310> it<00:03:35.549> and<00:03:36.239> I<00:03:36.569> just<00:03:36.750> think<00:03:36.959> that<00:03:37.049> it<00:03:37.200> was

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
changed it and I just think that it was

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.559 
changed it and I just think that it was
it<00:03:37.560> was<00:03:37.739> originally<00:03:38.400> I<00:03:38.970> think<00:03:39.239> they<00:03:39.510> were

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
it was originally I think they were

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:42.319 
it was originally I think they were
afraid<00:03:39.750> of<00:03:40.049> what<00:03:40.349> was<00:03:40.440> going<00:03:40.650> to<00:03:40.680> happen<00:03:40.829> to<00:03:41.489> to

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
afraid of what was going to happen to to

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
is that this isn't necessarily

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.060 
is that this isn't necessarily
progressive<00:04:40.020> necessarily<00:04:40.590> for<00:04:40.740> the<00:04:40.800> time<00:04:40.950> it

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
progressive necessarily for the time it

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.330

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
absolutely and this was going forward 40

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.270 
absolutely and this was going forward 40
years<00:04:48.000> ago<00:04:48.300> and<00:04:48.600> somewhere<00:04:49.410> we<00:04:49.470> stopped<00:04:50.070> it

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
years ago and somewhere we stopped it

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.640

because<00:04:53.160> companies<00:04:54.320> manufacturers<00:04:55.320> those

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
because companies manufacturers those

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.040 
because companies manufacturers those
things<00:04:55.860> became<00:04:56.190> a<00:04:56.250> big<00:04:56.460> deal<00:04:56.640> and<00:04:56.940> now<00:04:57.480> what
