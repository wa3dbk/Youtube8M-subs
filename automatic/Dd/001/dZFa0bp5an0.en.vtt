 I'll give you another tip here that I 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:14.759
 I commented in one of the previous videos about 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:19.890
 It's a little problem from here and if it is 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:24.090
 read only South Nioaque air intake 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:29.820
 air filter that happens when you close the 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:35.420
 Cap and I'll show you here on the hood until 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.420
 This rubber here when fertile 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.730
 he stands on it here until the 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.780
 rubber brand and in the precipitation and 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.030
 vibrations 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:50.100
 the boss gives you the money to move 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:52.350
 have that stop here and yes this other 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.329
 here it is beyond legend he did 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.570
 to align the 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.879
 capo with the paralama 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.750
 so it has a zygo vibration in it 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.159
 dmo freeze it move 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.930
 that hole 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:15.630
 this air intake has the screws here 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:19.860
 It is travinha and plastic and I commented in 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:26.050
 another video I was going to give a devom tip 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:30.590
 the lather between him and the can 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:33.890
 have to see if this entry because and 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:37.370
 start to roll can take it out here 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:41.150
 You and I even did the service 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:45.380
 looks like he's silent and even took out the 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:47.270
 that the softex in the first 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.630
 here it was also in the ldu who 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:54.590
 accompanied the video seen this in those who do not 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:57.680
 I saw just hunt for an anthology in my video and 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.430
 who will see that everything was here too 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:03.010
 grated 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:06.440
 You get a very thin air chamber. 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:09.710
 especially if this is a camera 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:14.180
 of bicycle air in a bicycle shop 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:18.770
 take an old camera and coast 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:24.050
 little piece looks when it was cut that 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:25.640
 double-sided piece with double easy 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:32.380
 O you paste here 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:38.890
 Look how nice and what makes this application 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:41.959
 it's perfect here it makes and it fits here 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:46.880
 accompanies with the bed with the gum and 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:49.630
 It fits because it has such a pussy that he 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.520
 raise money then makes a 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:58.870
 after collar with double-sided 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:03:01.700
 ask well and stayed regional beauty goes 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.170
 although happy about it from here, nor could 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.420
 have done it before 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.560
 so you have a tr4 and sometimes even 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:11.510
 one year younger one of the last nÃ© 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:16.880
 watch the shot and see if it has already happened 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:19.790
 This Wanted If It Happened Do What I Did 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:23.120
 This has not happened to prevent 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:25.489
 to start the ink is that for now 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.430
 did not arrive in the can but the bad it here 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.510
 is this to take away all ink 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.510
 water floods 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.489
 Every rain I wash is 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.810
 that water that underneath because you 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.780
 It will not get you out of here every time. 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.940
 to dry 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.810
 and will do what it will come to rust 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:50.160
 This is what makes it so. 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:54.300
 prevention is a precaution and a 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:57.750
 the original state of the car the car 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:00.470
 how much more can you save 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:05.580
 the original state it better and then 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:06.390
 Did the service put there in the box of the 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.510
 filter 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:15.030
 look there how it got legal support 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:18.260
 right on top of the can and there you 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.260
 Come on, man. 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:35.530
 also the screws that are to hold 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:43.750
 travinha she opened downstairs in nato 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:48.430
 not to leave there very simple ends the 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:50.950
 problem now the support is between a 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.890
 that I did is not the 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:57.600
 spoil this piece that is practical and 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:05:00.910
 also does not walk do not damage the painting 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:07.600

 check these things too 

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:21.460
 check the spark plug cable if you 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:23.410
 to look for a detour is one of the 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:26.770
 other and always leave a space 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:30.270
 between one and another not to happen 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:34.810
 grate with each other in the vibration 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:37.890
 the flight of hundreds and with time and 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:40.690
 decreases the life of your sail cable 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:43.169
 fils some wire also that you have 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:47.020
 leaning on something look for the 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:52.120
 distance and and heat to power 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:54.340
 is also to give more life to this 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:57.610
 beauty system 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.540
