 and the wolf is fighting the balls full 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.620
 to give the phone is a little 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.059
 more complicated if you want to buy it 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.920
 the adie is no problem the symbol for 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.800

 to advertise backs down I tell you 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.550
 and as we need we are an article at 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.640
 noble sense of 815 the processor if we 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.230
 will pass a little 810 shouted you can 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.850
 or why not an article we do not have 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.680
 actually but actually for this tale far from 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.640
 more oxygen bone dress is available 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.140
 for download 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.090
 So I did go to the site 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.650
 manufacturer you can find that one 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.540
 will have an article also on android had the 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.729
 best system for hackers not 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.659
 necessarily long use I think 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.570
 it's going to be pretty good 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.290
 an article about the remix tablet 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.060
 ultra tab 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:26.850
 so it's a table we actually like it 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.090
 arrange m here is a comment there 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.860
 above 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.360
 to monza where he had managed to buy it 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.619
 in price shocks thing is that that 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.670
 interested him to make the video that 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.210
 put on my channel and everything is 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.460
 change no it's finished that after the huge 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.310
 paros do it an arctic article 1 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.810
 guest editor do you make an article done 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.149

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.200
 gtv with pleasure is there have had with 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.590
 the guest actor who made us a 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.000
 article 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.200
 as much as it is to black to get there 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.729
 all so suddenly we'll still 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.860
 make an email to the little Chinese there 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.119
 from beijing saying that if they wanted 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.190

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.100
 pleasure and 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.000
 and that we would be very happy and 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.170
 like that it takes them to make them a 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.490
 little pub and where she launched a 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.510
 little their projects in europe one is 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.530
 still not too badly placed then 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.900
 now that we subtitle the videos 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.119
 it purrs anyway not too bad 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:13.920
 a little bit my shoe at the same time 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:17.250
 but in pictures on these by then then 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.230

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.410
 with the post so you have a 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.030
 little bit at night like that Wednesday all

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.260

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.490
 3 smartphones and it's about me 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.650

 do the same thing with the products 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.910
 high tech like that tomorrow it takes a 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.170
 little bit of articles for April 1st 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.370
 and finally today were punctuated 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.590
 by the two ads delivered for these 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.220
 five years then there will be what the xoom 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.080
 the 10.1 equestrian examines our rose 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.600
 cjn dress is all good ben here is 20000 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.330
 copies of 1500 years and a half their 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.370
 enemy 2 so the c2a what will be the most 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.860
 interesting or an iphone to 400 actually 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:21.180
 integrated the 599 r'n'b that will be put in 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:22.980
 flash sale on April 8 at 499 it's 75 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:27.120
 euros a phone that although they 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:29.519
 complete and finally the balance the scales 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.230
 I see there a balance wifi a quarter 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.000
 but a little 0.2 for support dragged a 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.200
 little does your evolution like this on your 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.570
 smartphone I believe there is a catch 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.100
 also after a while we will not talk 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.340
 all because after we turn a little in 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.230
 the home appliance and I first I 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.510
 meaning not I not find myself in a bit 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.800
 all this here I am confused with ground beef 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.300
 where they want to go well on these 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.000
 money matters there is so much a 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.860

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.250
 a moment when the world knows there will be 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.989
 a very good quality which is a price 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.980
 shock people will buy it as long as 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.360
 I snatch people will buy 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:04.319
 there is a potential in China that is 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.490
 huge so enough is right no 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:07.050
 arms all 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.000
 not enjoy good after well here 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.530

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.630
 stuff and well you're going to be a little 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:16.050
 little disappointed so today we did the 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:18.720
 test of ths 2015 not bad and I i 

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:20.220
 prepared the test of the cub ie8 and 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.030
 the packaging is it nico who 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.170

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.360
 well and after when I wanted to recover 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:30.570
 my photos I put the truck in vain 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:34.770
 Micro USB to USB not mark not work 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.730
 at all where everything is so suddenly I'm 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.040
 say ah it comes from my mac 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:39.750
 sometimes it happens like that so I 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.820
 my friends that it's on his windows he 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.440

 day facts not but the mobsters the 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.540
 beef mobs no but oh that's a 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.120
 mini computer can not plug it a 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.570
 PC any damn I want to put them 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.150
 slaps 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:59.070
 we put you in lowlands dude well 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.990
 sure they come micro usb via the 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.850
 micro USB cable from your computer 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.870
 to be able to transfer the stuff 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.580
 fucking the guys it's really 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.440
 agrati baltring not know or for 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.420
 to clear a little hills in 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.860
 whatever fucking thing it seems to me anymore 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.240
 so in my opinion not tomorrow had 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.070
 returned there and that he tries with 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.540
 base because I managed in the 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:16.830
 plugging in return have a little 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.250
 the device but in my opinion it's the 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:22.590
 connectivity and who can 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:24.300
 so here are the news the comments 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.160
 nothing too much I went back to banshee 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.980
 episode iii the hall makes makes go 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.940
 against the Czech fighting and all 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:31.530
 do not fizzle that I'm going 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.220
 maybe do me the 13/15 because we 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.200
 still told me it was really 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.790
 good but it does not go to the trick and 

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.750
 the pirates I believe it's john when he 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:40.140
 was there he started looking at me he 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:44.400
 said not terrible terrible so still 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:45.390
 a small reserve and finally and finally 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.710
 so I have not had too many comments that 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:48.420
 that the video was yesterday because of the day 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.380
 +1 I do not have too many comments 

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.560
 I might have a little more 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.560
 today 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:57.360
 here we go to finish on one last 

00:05:54.509 --> 00:06:00.150
 note about boxing that makes me a 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:03.419
 mail saying yes there is a guy who 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:05.069
 tells us that he did the writers 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:08.639
 guests that he made articles his jt 

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:11.129
 geek that's it and that the request for help 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:13.050
 phoning review gratos and everything so 

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:14.340
 So here is the idea that there are some who 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:16.770
 come who make writers to screw 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:17.819
 guest editor articles on the 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.990
 blog and after they'll see the 

00:06:17.819 --> 00:06:20.939
 partners increasing it to offer them 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:25.349
 phone so I do not know how the 

00:06:20.939 --> 00:06:26.789
 still take you already she comes 

00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:28.259
 and where is that so in fact so what is it 

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:30.629
 the thing is, in fact, you take yourself 

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:31.469
 jumped after you waste 

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:32.849
 technical so it's nice to do 

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:34.409
 to leave a guest but we feel that 

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:35.819
 after all is interested so it's a 

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:38.099
 little relou what serves almost for 

00:06:35.819 --> 00:06:39.360
 contact them finish our partners for 

00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:40.879
 ask them who invades you 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.770
 products for you to do the reviews 

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:46.229
 why we republish them on the jt geek 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:47.520
