actually I told him he was goofy why do
I<00:02:58.269> probably<00:02:58.540> thought<00:02:58.750> I<00:02:58.810> was<00:02:58.870> a<00:02:58.989> little<00:02:59.140> nuts

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500

I probably thought I was a little nuts
but<00:02:59.769> I<00:03:00.130> think<00:03:00.489> after<00:03:00.760> the<00:03:01.030> first<00:03:01.300> couple<00:03:01.540> of

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
but I think after the first couple of

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.770 
but I think after the first couple of
storefronts<00:03:02.380> went<00:03:02.590> up<00:03:02.769> she<00:03:03.700> started<00:03:04.420> to<00:03:04.510> see

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
storefronts went up she started to see

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.530 
storefronts went up she started to see
but<00:03:05.260> I<00:03:05.290> was<00:03:05.500> able<00:03:05.650> to<00:03:05.800> do<00:03:06.040> it<00:03:06.880> was<00:03:07.030> probably

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
but I was able to do it was probably

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.370 
but I was able to do it was probably
during<00:03:07.810> my<00:03:08.080> early<00:03:08.410> teens<00:03:08.680> where<00:03:09.100> I<00:03:10.380> remember

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
during my early teens where I remember

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.840 
during my early teens where I remember
kind<00:03:11.620> of<00:03:11.739> playing<00:03:11.980> down<00:03:12.160> here<00:03:12.190> it<00:03:12.519> was<00:03:12.610> halfway

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
kind of playing down here it was halfway

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.150 
kind of playing down here it was halfway
done<00:03:13.330> and<00:03:13.660> I<00:03:13.780> can<00:03:14.019> actually<00:03:14.350> visualize<00:03:14.799> this

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
done and I can actually visualize this

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.850 
done and I can actually visualize this
being<00:03:15.580> complete<00:03:16.060> and<00:03:16.330> then<00:03:16.870> you<00:03:17.140> know<00:03:17.380> okay<00:03:17.830> I

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
being complete and then you know okay I

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.090 
being complete and then you know okay I
see<00:03:18.160> how<00:03:18.310> this<00:03:18.400> is<00:03:18.489> going<00:03:18.700> to<00:03:18.760> happen<00:03:20.040> this<00:03:21.040> is

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
see how this is going to happen this is

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.720
