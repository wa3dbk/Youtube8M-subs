two would be make another one side three
steps<00:02:07.910> II<00:02:08.149> would<00:02:08.390> be<00:02:09.729> make<00:02:10.729> a<00:02:10.760> parallel<00:02:11.450> pipe

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
steps II would be make a parallel pipe

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:21.370 
steps II would be make a parallel pipe
federline<00:02:13.490> decision<00:02:16.690> step<00:02:17.690> 4<00:02:19.959> make<00:02:20.959> a<00:02:20.989> stand

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.270 
federline decision step 4 make a stand
pipe<00:02:21.980> here

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.210 

instead<00:02:27.120> I<00:02:27.390> would<00:02:27.900> be

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:37.050 

make<00:02:30.880> it<00:02:31.030> horizontal<00:02:31.660> line<00:02:34.080> okay<00:02:35.080> our<00:02:36.060> second

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
make it horizontal line okay our second

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.890 
make it horizontal line okay our second
bottle<00:02:37.210> is<00:02:37.630> a<00:02:38.700> remove<00:02:39.700> this<00:02:39.850> thing<00:02:40.060> up<00:02:40.240> a
