iOS 5.0 now aspire is a 100 megabyte
download<00:01:40.770> so<00:01:41.700> make<00:01:42.150> sure<00:01:42.180> you're<00:01:42.450> connected

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.830 
download so make sure you're connected
to<00:01:42.930> Wi-Fi<00:01:43.400> before<00:01:44.400> you<00:01:44.550> install<00:01:44.850> spire<00:01:45.330> and<00:01:45.720> it

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
to Wi-Fi before you install spire and it

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.320 
to Wi-Fi before you install spire and it
basically<00:01:45.960> will<00:01:46.410> work<00:01:46.710> now<00:01:47.250> what<00:01:47.970> spire

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
basically will work now what spire

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.130 
basically will work now what spire
basically<00:01:49.050> does<00:01:49.290> is<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.400> just<00:01:50.780> makes<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:51.930> use

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
basically does is it just makes you use

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.540 
basically does is it just makes you use
a<00:01:52.350> proxy<00:01:52.800> server<00:01:53.510> instead<00:01:54.510> so<00:01:54.810> it's<00:01:54.990> much<00:01:55.260> more

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:55.550 
a proxy server instead so it's much more

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.280 
a proxy server instead so it's much more
safer<00:01:56.550> and<00:01:56.729> it's<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.030> legal<00:01:57.300> way<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.630> get<00:01:57.930> Siri

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
safer and it's the legal way to get Siri

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.650
