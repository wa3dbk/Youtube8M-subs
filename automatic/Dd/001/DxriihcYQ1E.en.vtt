00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.639
 please, it comes to me people here is yours 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.090
 kran vigorously play a new one today 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.490
 Round ride victory and I had to 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.970
 for that shark I am 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.460
 just youtube blogs for that too 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.140
 Help is amazingly good 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:35.520
 So I'm working directly 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:36.930
 come and, exceptionally, there was otherwise 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.940
 yes already one or the other problem with 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.329
 dhf but that's a pretty good one 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.820
 luca has also run here 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.800
 get his vip status taken away 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.660
 the help that's quite a bit 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.480
 crass place because it takes even 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.860
 regular on the server and I have 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.340
 again no hiding found 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:00.300
 they are also, of course, do not run 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:02.960
 possible is a comm I make myself 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.369
 there I am just fine 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:10.229
 the successful attempt started 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:19.770
 to kill a thing causes ill 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:21.600
 the recording is clear because I prefer 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.890
 out because if you two jukebox is in it 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.090
 that's a bit like sitting 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.229
 conspicuous the other does not know if him 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.369
 run after all is definitely 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:36.990
 I'm waiting for that I mean that I mean 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:39.299
 makes war and just is me 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.049
 namely already succeeded 1 1 -sieg 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.509
 kill 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.670
 haider is in trouble with that 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:49.439
 wooden sword against winner with what the 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:54.270
 winners have everything and the biggest 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:57.200
 people super cool he is yes I am yes 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.200
 not premium on the has 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.530
 at youtube a super you are all 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.530
 negative 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.500
 No, I already have the only one 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.390
 killed and if I do it again 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.950
 see one walking around alone when 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.810
 Also in the third run forward but the 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:39.120
 is really mega funny you can not get one 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:52.349
 points when as a haider on one 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:53.090
 it comes to me you have it 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:54.989
 seen 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.900
 Of course, now I want to be followed by 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:00.110
 but in the meantime, I invite you to borrow 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:05.060
 experience on but I've only just 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:05.060
 killed as haider only 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:11.160
 if they keep playing like that 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:16.079
 little pvp heard it or if it was easy 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:19.850
 It's hard against anything against an army 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:23.730
 but to fight against his blog 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:29.849
 They are following me in pairs or now 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:33.750
 only one only one you can I'm afraid 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:38.819
 we still manage to be there in two okay 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:40.319
 I prefer to walk a bit ok 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:42.930
 they have me but it was ok 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:46.680
 quite funny so now you can see 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:50.910
 a spyder also know people one 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:53.760
 typists tja so that's living a 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:57.889
 teacher so is life sometimes dies 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.889
 it was so luke podolski wisdom 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.590
 you just get the kite 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:19.830
 what the fuck me is watching him 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:21.690
 we prefer to search the jessica as 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:24.170
 by the way, just to look for 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.130
 such but we can sometimes in the 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:30.320
 live looking for a jukebox 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:39.570
 maybe we will find life still as life 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:42.750
 six high def that's neat and 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.720
 is behind box that all looks like 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.830
 it just water 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:05:00.680
 He just waits for him to open the door 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:05:04.010
 open the ok ok ok most likely 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.010
 annoying buttons 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.130
 OK 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:16.400
 he knew in what the fuck he is out 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:23.780
 haye had the biscuit we expect 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:28.230
 but believe it down here 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:31.140
 well, in any case, still me 

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:34.080
 celebrate it anyway mean that we as 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:40.790
 i have killed winners in heyda 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:46.680
 there are those nasty noises or and 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:48.750
 side with her very terrible where 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.070
 are they nor any people so 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:52.140
 but would also be bad if that 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:54.300
 noise would not give 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.560
 otherwise the people would all run around 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.360
 and beat every block 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.800
 up here is intended someone 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.930
 climb up there is faith 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:05.490
 I once again that the stripping of 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:07.470
 zombie bit what you call it though 

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:11.040
 Something says there is the strip 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:15.450
 my god my jokes are too shallow for 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:18.990
 this world and mining heath is on its way 

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:20.520
 points I have 145 tokens I am 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:23.100
 that's how blatantly simple I am 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:25.620
 i guess what i think about 150 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:27.660
 there is nothing here this shop luca 

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.830
 working towards a compass on it 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:34.410
 if I am the right one 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:36.530
 remember and the holder 3000 tokens good 

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:38.880
 I will never manage my life 

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:41.220
 also looks neat i could yes 

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:43.440
 Let's say the round finds something 

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:45.240
 I did not say anything at nico's 

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.320
 sound should be improved significantly 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.680
 because i am now at the computer of 

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:51.090
 my brother plays and yes writes 

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.560
 but let the comments as the 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:55.320
 microphone sound you will find the round 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.970
 finds and if any others 

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:58.710
 Suggestions for my channel has videos 

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:00.600
 somehow they're supposed to play the ones I do 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:02.310
 then gamble should write me in synonymous 

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:06.030
