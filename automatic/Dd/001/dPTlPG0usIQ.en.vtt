lots of compression starts and runs a
nice<00:01:22.920> carb<00:01:23.920> could<00:01:24.189> use<00:01:24.490> a<00:01:24.520> little<00:01:24.789> bit<00:01:24.880> of

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:24.969 
nice carb could use a little bit of

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:29.879 
nice carb could use a little bit of
tuning<00:01:25.329> I<00:01:26.789> did<00:01:27.789> take<00:01:28.479> off<00:01:28.630> the<00:01:28.810> bowl<00:01:28.990> last<00:01:29.590> fall

00:01:29.879 --> 00:01:29.889 
tuning I did take off the bowl last fall

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:31.080 
tuning I did take off the bowl last fall
and<00:01:30.099> just<00:01:30.159> kind<00:01:30.399> of<00:01:30.459> checked<00:01:30.700> it<00:01:30.849> all<00:01:30.969> it<00:01:31.029> is

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
and just kind of checked it all it is

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.989 
and just kind of checked it all it is
pretty<00:01:31.359> clean<00:01:31.569> on<00:01:31.719> the<00:01:31.810> inside<00:01:32.429> feeling<00:01:33.429> needs

00:01:33.989 --> 00:01:33.999 
pretty clean on the inside feeling needs

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:38.010 
pretty clean on the inside feeling needs
to<00:01:34.090> be<00:01:34.179> changed<00:01:34.539> it's<00:01:34.659> a<00:01:34.840> rock-hard<00:01:36.810> so<00:01:37.810> that's

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
to be changed it's a rock-hard so that's

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.929 
to be changed it's a rock-hard so that's
normal<00:01:38.969> fuel<00:01:39.969> shut<00:01:40.209> off<00:01:40.329> here<00:01:41.399> has<00:01:42.399> a<00:01:42.429> pulley

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:42.939 
normal fuel shut off here has a pulley

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:44.609 
normal fuel shut off here has a pulley
on<00:01:43.209> it<00:01:43.419> normally<00:01:43.719> adjustable<00:01:44.200> tapes<00:01:44.409> that

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
on it normally adjustable tapes that

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:48.330 
on it normally adjustable tapes that
could<00:01:45.069> be<00:01:45.599> unscrewed<00:01:46.599> here<00:01:46.929> modified<00:01:47.409> for

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
could be unscrewed here modified for

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.760 
could be unscrewed here modified for
different<00:01:48.369> thicknesses<00:01:49.090> belt<00:01:49.479> it<00:01:50.259> has<00:01:50.289> the

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
different thicknesses belt it has the

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.769 
different thicknesses belt it has the
street<00:01:51.009> through<00:01:51.279> exhaust<00:01:51.729> kind<00:01:52.419> of<00:01:52.479> like<00:01:52.630> what

00:01:52.769 --> 00:01:52.779 
street through exhaust kind of like what

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:54.870 
street through exhaust kind of like what
they<00:01:52.899> used<00:01:53.109> on<00:01:53.259> a<00:01:53.289> few<00:01:53.499> racing<00:01:53.859> models<00:01:54.069> I<00:01:54.459> have

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
they used on a few racing models I have

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.849 
they used on a few racing models I have
had<00:01:55.239> models<00:01:55.659> too<00:01:55.749> had<00:01:55.869> the<00:01:55.989> big<00:01:56.139> canister<00:01:56.649> type

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:56.859 
had models too had the big canister type

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:59.749 
had models too had the big canister type
exhaust<00:01:57.399> so<00:01:58.389> this<00:01:58.810> is<00:01:58.959> the<00:01:59.049> kill<00:01:59.229> switch<00:01:59.439> wire

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
exhaust so this is the kill switch wire

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.429 
exhaust so this is the kill switch wire
not<00:02:00.759> hooked<00:02:00.999> up<00:02:01.119> to<00:02:01.299> anything<00:02:04.439> throttle

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 
not hooked up to anything throttle

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:09.059 
not hooked up to anything throttle
control<00:02:05.770> I<00:02:06.749> got<00:02:07.749> it<00:02:07.899> that<00:02:08.050> was<00:02:08.080> all<00:02:08.319> well<00:02:08.860> how

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
control I got it that was all well how

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.620 
control I got it that was all well how

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
about this I'm gonna play the video of

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.899 
about this I'm gonna play the video of
the<00:02:10.780> first<00:02:10.959> time<00:02:11.319> this<00:02:11.530> engine<00:02:11.890> has<00:02:12.069> ran<00:02:12.310> in<00:02:12.549> 20

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:12.909 
the first time this engine has ran in 20

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:15.509 
the first time this engine has ran in 20
years<00:02:13.090> and<00:02:13.420> I<00:02:14.349> never<00:02:14.409> ran<00:02:14.739> it<00:02:14.920> since<00:02:15.219> the<00:02:15.430> end

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
years and I never ran it since the end

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:16.950 
years and I never ran it since the end
of<00:02:15.640> this<00:02:15.760> video<00:02:16.030> so

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
of this video so

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.230 
of this video so
this<00:02:17.110> lever<00:02:17.590> here<00:02:17.890> was<00:02:18.070> originally<00:02:19.030> very

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
this lever here was originally very

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.110 
this lever here was originally very
stiff<00:02:19.690> and<00:02:19.720> it<00:02:19.900> wouldn't<00:02:20.080> work<00:02:20.200> so<00:02:20.910> right<00:02:21.910> now

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
stiff and it wouldn't work so right now

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.180 
stiff and it wouldn't work so right now
it's<00:02:22.540> all<00:02:22.780> broken<00:02:23.200> loose<00:02:23.380> you<00:02:23.710> could<00:02:23.860> see<00:02:24.040> that

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
it's all broken loose you could see that

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.130 
it's all broken loose you could see that
he<00:02:24.430> has<00:02:24.580> it<00:02:24.820> set<00:02:25.060> so<00:02:25.090> it<00:02:25.300> doesn't<00:02:25.600> rev<00:02:25.750> up<00:02:25.870> past

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
he has it set so it doesn't rev up past

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.800 
he has it set so it doesn't rev up past
a<00:02:26.260> certain<00:02:26.440> point<00:02:27.090> so<00:02:28.090> the<00:02:28.360> screws<00:02:28.630> all<00:02:28.780> the

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
a certain point so the screws all the

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.630 
a certain point so the screws all the
way<00:02:28.930> out<00:02:29.110> so<00:02:29.350> for<00:02:29.560> racing<00:02:29.890> you<00:02:30.010> just<00:02:30.220> I<00:02:30.460> guess

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
way out so for racing you just I guess

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.670 
way out so for racing you just I guess
remove<00:02:31.120> that<00:02:31.390> change<00:02:31.750> it<00:02:32.130> I<00:02:33.150> know<00:02:34.410> somewhere<00:02:35.410> I

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
remove that change it I know somewhere I

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.040 
remove that change it I know somewhere I
have<00:02:36.010> the<00:02:36.190> air<00:02:36.370> filter<00:02:36.880> for<00:02:37.180> it<00:02:37.330> like<00:02:37.780> the

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
have the air filter for it like the

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.050 
have the air filter for it like the
style<00:02:39.040> that<00:02:39.280> goes<00:02:39.400> on<00:02:39.610> it<00:02:39.730> kind<00:02:39.790> of<00:02:39.880> like<00:02:39.940> a

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
style that goes on it kind of like a

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.050 
style that goes on it kind of like a
chainsaw<00:02:40.270> let's<00:02:40.870> say<00:02:41.410> style<00:02:41.740> one<00:02:41.980> but<00:02:42.640> I'm<00:02:42.790> as

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
so I know it's going to run now it has

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.650 
so I know it's going to run now it has
spark<00:04:38.740> it's<00:04:38.980> going<00:04:39.220> to<00:04:39.280> be<00:04:39.340> good<00:04:39.460> so<00:04:39.850> anyway

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660
