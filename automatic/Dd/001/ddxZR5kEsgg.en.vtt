common reason for the check engine light
being<00:00:49.210> on<00:00:49.360> is<00:00:49.570> maybe<00:00:49.809> filling<00:00:50.200> up<00:00:50.290> the<00:00:50.410> car

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.440 
being on is maybe filling up the car

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.020 
being on is maybe filling up the car
with<00:00:50.680> the<00:00:51.070> car<00:00:51.219> running
