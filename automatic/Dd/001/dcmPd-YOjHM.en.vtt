visor fogs up quite heavily so you do
have<00:02:22.950> to<00:02:23.280> be<00:02:23.400> careful

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
have to be careful

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.930 
have to be careful
I'll<00:02:26.100> make<00:02:26.250> sure<00:02:26.280> you<00:02:26.460> see<00:02:26.640> where<00:02:26.850> you're

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
I'll make sure you see where you're

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.150 
I'll make sure you see where you're
going<00:02:27.950> right<00:02:28.950> over<00:02:30.050> these<00:02:31.050> these<00:02:31.470> tabs<00:02:31.860> you<00:02:32.040> do

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
going right over these these tabs you do

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.680 
going right over these these tabs you do
after<00:02:32.670> make<00:02:32.880> sure<00:02:33.030> that<00:02:33.180> they<00:02:33.300> lock<00:02:33.540> on

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
after make sure that they lock on

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.070 
after make sure that they lock on
perfectly<00:02:34.290> together<00:02:34.620> it<00:02:35.460> can<00:02:35.760> be<00:02:35.790> a<00:02:36.480> bit

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
perfectly together it can be a bit

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.170 
perfectly together it can be a bit
difficult<00:02:37.290> as<00:02:37.800> they<00:02:38.130> are<00:02:38.220> quite<00:02:38.490> a<00:02:38.520> tight<00:02:38.850> fit

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
difficult as they are quite a tight fit

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.390 
difficult as they are quite a tight fit
so<00:02:40.050> just<00:02:40.380> be<00:02:40.500> patient<00:02:40.680> with<00:02:41.010> it<00:02:41.130> because<00:02:41.250> you

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
so just be patient with it because you

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.760 
so just be patient with it because you
don't<00:02:41.700> want<00:02:41.850> to<00:02:42.090> break<00:02:42.330> this<00:02:42.590> you<00:02:43.590> probably

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
don't want to break this you probably

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:51.170 
don't want to break this you probably
will<00:02:44.010> figure<00:02:44.220> out<00:02:44.930> inside<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.110> helmet<00:02:50.180> and

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
will figure out inside the helmet and

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:57.230 
will figure out inside the helmet and
see<00:02:51.680> foam<00:02:52.680> on<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.520> top<00:02:54.260> there<00:02:55.850> around<00:02:56.850> the
