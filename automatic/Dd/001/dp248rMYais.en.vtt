00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:32.250 

here

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.530 

suppose<00:02:32.920> that

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
suppose that

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.000 
suppose that
so<00:02:35.050> go<00:02:35.409> to<00:02:35.470> this<00:02:36.150> nice<00:02:37.150> dude<00:02:37.590> good<00:02:38.590> morning

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:03:13.750 

so<00:02:56.970> two<00:02:57.970> years<00:02:58.180> half<00:02:58.690> of<00:02:58.870> this

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.750 

there's<00:03:14.330> a<00:03:14.450> lot<00:03:14.660> of<00:03:14.690> times<00:03:14.989> where<00:03:15.430> just<00:03:16.430> put

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
there's a lot of times where just put

00:03:16.760 --> 00:05:01.600 
there's a lot of times where just put
half<00:03:17.000> of<00:03:17.150> it<00:03:19.540> and<00:03:20.540> then<00:03:20.930> put<00:03:21.769> the<00:03:21.890> rest<00:03:22.010> of<00:03:22.190> it

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:13.430 

so<00:05:08.420> whatever<00:05:09.420> you<00:05:09.720> have<00:05:09.960> because<00:05:10.500> I<00:05:11.480> know<00:05:12.480> the

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
so whatever you have because I know the

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.650 
so whatever you have because I know the
person<00:05:13.680> I'm<00:05:13.770> giving<00:05:14.070> it<00:05:14.190> to<00:05:14.340> she<00:05:15.120> really<00:05:15.150> likes

person I'm giving it to she really likes

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.700 
person I'm giving it to she really likes
it<00:05:15.840> to<00:05:15.960> be<00:05:15.990> liquid<00:05:16.440> so<00:05:16.740> if<00:05:17.580> you<00:05:17.880> think<00:05:18.150> it's

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
it to be liquid so if you think it's

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:27.950 
it to be liquid so if you think it's
tasty<00:05:19.710> much<00:05:19.950> like<00:05:20.130> coffee<00:05:24.320> ice<00:05:25.320> cream<00:05:26.960> and

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
tasty much like coffee ice cream and

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:33.070 
tasty much like coffee ice cream and
it's<00:05:28.710> much<00:05:29.040> better<00:05:29.280> when<00:05:29.700> it's<00:05:30.240> only

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.350 

smooshy<00:05:34.080> so<00:05:34.440> that's<00:05:35.280> why<00:05:35.460> I<00:05:35.490> like<00:05:35.640> ice<00:05:36.330> cream

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360
