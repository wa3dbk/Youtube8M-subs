now<00:06:55.469> it's<00:06:55.680> there<00:06:55.919> and<00:06:56.400> I<00:06:56.969> believe<00:06:57.270> you<00:06:57.360> can

00:06:57.469 --> 00:06:57.479 
now it's there and I believe you can

play single-player games while you're

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:01.689 
play single-player games while you're
doing<00:06:59.759> this<00:06:59.879> and<00:07:00.120> it<00:07:00.210> should<00:07:00.389> still<00:07:00.719> continue

00:07:01.689 --> 00:07:01.699 
doing this and it should still continue

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:03.920 
doing this and it should still continue
I'm<00:07:02.699> not<00:07:03.000> sure<00:07:03.210> if<00:07:03.300> you'll<00:07:03.419> be<00:07:03.569> able<00:07:03.659> to<00:07:03.779> play

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:03.930 
I'm not sure if you'll be able to play

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:06.950 
I'm not sure if you'll be able to play
online<00:07:04.259> because<00:07:05.270> download<00:07:06.270> sometimes<00:07:06.689> stop

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:06.960 
online because download sometimes stop

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.899 
online because download sometimes stop
when<00:07:07.169> you<00:07:07.229> play<00:07:07.409> online<00:07:07.560> to<00:07:07.979> prevent<00:07:08.520> lag<00:07:08.729> and

00:07:08.899 --> 00:07:08.909 
when you play online to prevent lag and

00:07:08.909 --> 00:07:10.579 
when you play online to prevent lag and
everything<00:07:09.210> but<00:07:09.750> this<00:07:09.930> is<00:07:10.080> the<00:07:10.169> way<00:07:10.289> to<00:07:10.349> fix

00:07:10.579 --> 00:07:10.589 
everything but this is the way to fix

00:07:10.589 --> 00:07:13.040
