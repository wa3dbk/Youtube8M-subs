it lets my hair really soft I will say

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.330 
it lets my hair really soft I will say
that<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.150> do<00:01:33.450> think<00:01:34.049> that<00:01:34.290> this<00:01:34.500> means<00:01:34.770> an<00:01:35.040> oil

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
that I do think that this means an oil

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.330 
that I do think that this means an oil
sealer<00:01:35.909> so<00:01:36.509> next<00:01:37.200> time<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:37.710> use<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.220> I'll

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
sealer so next time that I use it I'll

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.340 
sealer so next time that I use it I'll
probably<00:01:38.520> put<00:01:39.030> like<00:01:39.210> coconut<00:01:39.750> oil<00:01:39.930> or

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
probably put like coconut oil or

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.140 
probably put like coconut oil or
Jamaican<00:01:40.860> black<00:01:40.979> castor<00:01:41.040> oil<00:01:41.400> over<00:01:42.030> it

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
Jamaican black castor oil over it

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.109 
Jamaican black castor oil over it
because<00:01:42.479> my<00:01:43.320> hair<00:01:43.560> does<00:01:43.770> feel<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.159> little<00:01:44.520> dry

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
because my hair does feel a little dry

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.149 
because my hair does feel a little dry
now<00:01:45.600> give<00:01:45.869> it<00:01:45.899> like<00:01:46.079> a<00:01:46.110> 4<00:01:46.409> out<00:01:46.530> of<00:01:46.649> 5<00:01:46.829> just

now give it like a 4 out of 5 just

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.690 
now give it like a 4 out of 5 just
because<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.549> think<00:01:47.899> it<00:01:48.899> will<00:01:49.259> need<00:01:49.470> an<00:01:49.890> oil<00:01:50.310> that

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.660 
because I think it will need an oil that

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.510 
conditioner and yeah I really liked how
this<00:02:28.180> felt<00:02:28.480> in<00:02:28.630> my<00:02:28.750> hair<00:02:29.020> was<00:02:29.350> super<00:02:29.770> soft<00:02:30.070> and

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
this felt in my hair was super soft and

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.710 
this felt in my hair was super soft and
now<00:02:31.450> I<00:02:31.480> am<00:02:31.930> just<00:02:32.140> going<00:02:32.350> to<00:02:32.470> diffuse<00:02:33.190> it<00:02:33.400> and<00:02:33.730> I

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
now I am just going to diffuse it and I

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.110 
now I am just going to diffuse it and I
will<00:02:34.990> be<00:02:35.140> right<00:02:35.350> back<00:02:35.530> so<00:02:35.980> this<00:02:36.459> is<00:02:36.520> my<00:02:36.850> hair

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
will be right back so this is my hair

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.440 
will be right back so this is my hair
not<00:02:37.840> completely<00:02:38.560> dry<00:02:38.920> it's<00:02:39.340> kind<00:02:39.820> of<00:02:39.970> damp

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
not completely dry it's kind of damp

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.870 
not completely dry it's kind of damp
which<00:02:41.290> is<00:02:41.470> okay<00:02:41.860> because<00:02:42.070> I'm<00:02:42.430> going<00:02:42.640> to<00:02:42.790> be

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
which is okay because I'm going to be

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.540 
which is okay because I'm going to be
leaving<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.270> braids<00:02:43.630> in<00:02:43.930> for<00:02:44.740> a<00:02:44.800> while<00:02:45.070> so<00:02:45.520> I

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
leaving the braids in for a while so I

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.730 
leaving the braids in for a while so I
know<00:02:45.700> they're<00:02:46.060> gonna<00:02:46.209> be<00:02:46.390> dry<00:02:46.690> for<00:02:46.750> sure<00:02:47.170> you

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
know they're gonna be dry for sure you

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.680 
know they're gonna be dry for sure you
want<00:02:47.920> to<00:02:47.980> make<00:02:48.130> sure<00:02:48.160> your<00:02:48.550> braids<00:02:49.120> are<00:02:49.360> dry

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
want to make sure your braids are dry

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.790 
want to make sure your braids are dry
for<00:02:50.350> sure<00:02:50.680> and<00:02:51.040> now<00:02:51.760> I<00:02:51.820> am<00:02:52.270> just<00:02:52.650> combing<00:02:53.650> it

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
for sure and now I am just combing it

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.070 
for sure and now I am just combing it
out<00:02:53.920> because<00:02:54.580> I<00:02:54.610> think<00:02:55.240> the<00:02:55.420> results<00:02:55.930> look

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
out because I think the results look

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.140 
out because I think the results look
better<00:02:56.380> when<00:02:56.680> I<00:02:56.709> don't<00:02:56.920> have<00:02:57.430> as<00:02:57.610> much<00:02:57.790> as<00:02:58.000> my

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
better when I don't have as much as my

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.310 
better when I don't have as much as my
own<00:02:58.180> curl<00:02:58.990> pattern<00:02:59.620> in<00:02:59.860> the<00:03:00.430> braids<00:03:00.720> so<00:03:01.720> now<00:03:02.080> I

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
own curl pattern in the braids so now I

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.640 
own curl pattern in the braids so now I
am<00:03:02.920> just<00:03:03.280> writing<00:03:04.090> it<00:03:04.390> after<00:03:04.780> I<00:03:04.810> make<00:03:05.260> four

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
am just writing it after I make four

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.509 
am just writing it after I make four
parts<00:03:06.190> in<00:03:06.400> my<00:03:06.700> hair<00:03:07.030> and<00:03:07.530> I<00:03:08.530> only<00:03:08.860> braid<00:03:09.250> it<00:03:09.400> to

in<00:03:54.700> the<00:03:54.760> morning<00:03:55.239> and<00:03:55.420> I'm<00:03:55.690> going<00:03:55.989> to<00:03:56.049> take

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
in the morning and I'm going to take

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.039 
in the morning and I'm going to take
down<00:03:56.560> the<00:03:56.620> braids<00:03:57.070> so<00:03:57.880> you<00:03:57.910> want<00:03:58.450> to<00:03:58.570> just<00:03:58.780> be

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049 
down the braids so you want to just be

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:01.610 
down the braids so you want to just be
careful<00:03:59.350> with<00:03:59.950> taking<00:03:59.980> the<00:04:00.790> braids<00:04:01.090> down

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
careful with taking the braids down

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.310 
careful with taking the braids down
because<00:04:02.620> you<00:04:02.950> don't<00:04:03.160> want<00:04:03.489> it<00:04:03.610> to<00:04:03.820> frizz<00:04:04.209> up

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
because you don't want it to frizz up

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.129 
because you don't want it to frizz up
which<00:04:05.320> that<00:04:05.769> happens<00:04:06.220> to<00:04:06.519> me<00:04:06.670> a<00:04:06.700> lot<00:04:07.000> when<00:04:07.480> I<00:04:07.540> do

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:08.139 
which that happens to me a lot when I do

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:10.110 
which that happens to me a lot when I do
the<00:04:08.290> French<00:04:08.620> braid<00:04:08.950> but<00:04:09.010> you<00:04:09.400> just<00:04:09.609> have<00:04:09.820> to<00:04:10.000> be

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
the French braid but you just have to be

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.960 
the French braid but you just have to be
super<00:04:10.450> gentle<00:04:10.900> and<00:04:11.350> super<00:04:11.739> careful<00:04:12.220> and

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
super gentle and super careful and

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.540 
super gentle and super careful and
I do<00:04:13.240> a<00:04:13.270> lot<00:04:13.570> of<00:04:13.600> pulling<00:04:14.170> and<00:04:14.350> stuff<00:04:14.710> and<00:04:15.100> that

I do a lot of pulling and stuff and that

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.210 
I do a lot of pulling and stuff and that
helps<00:04:15.880> with<00:04:16.090> it<00:04:16.269> some<00:04:16.630> but<00:04:17.230> now<00:04:17.410> I'm<00:04:17.680> going<00:04:18.040> to
