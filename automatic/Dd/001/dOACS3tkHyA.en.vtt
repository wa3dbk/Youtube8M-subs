00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.940
 for what - in the station of the cease-fire warehouse we have a little 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.779
 disappointed because he has the charge that I win 

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:14.789
 but 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:17.789
 in a colossal match agreed to deal with urban cleanliness 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:19.890
 of the team 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.099
 in proximity relay to score the third goal b I think so 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:26.310
 the tie service taxi 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.439
 which was until then what to do in a match against this violence 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.230
 nuclear we can not believe why 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.329
 in e2 it's too many points 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.060
 because the previous and cdd and see the highest in the rankings 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.550
 11 am I do not believe it 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.250
 today we tried to do that 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.370
 we have a second time the multiplication of blues 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.620
 score the second goal we scored the parliament did not keep the break I 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.620
 think the match missed a lot of the different colors 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.720
 how can he year with the powerful his marks 3 matches the 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.720
 match is over 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.480
 it was not it's not possible I think and at that moment it was 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.060
 the standard that has 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.530
 who acquired manchester 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.430
 the end of the prayer 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.190
 it's finally the game ends early I thought 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.160
 the person who stutters little 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.280
 recognized as a little disappointed waco 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.490
 all 18 years 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.380
 the game is different for us 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.380
 it's a pity we are backing -11% 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.040
 but to marielle but I prefer to go back up lots of things for you 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.450
 could score more goals so 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.070
 this season I knew immediately 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.330
 I run I say with a lot of commitment with a lot of some 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.210
 newspapers too but I believe he had started celebrations 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.210
 and we've seen injuries can be a bit premature 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.690
 a good game plan recently it caused a sensation 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:49.900
 our roger match 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.350
 and if not maybe from the dvd 6% 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.820
 I did not think a lot of equipped will come take a point 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.229
 but here it is but I think that if we had asked more balloons the 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:00.640
 connection with the three points 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.430
 I think the beta did not have enough guts 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.290
 as soon as the public the public friaa pbc done directly and and give life to 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.689
 cards cards 

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:11.810
 in the warehouse of normal mistakes I mean of match 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:15.479
 she can go from there it's what you take a yellow tip of 

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:18.279
 americas in the red they will stand this year but put them 

00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:20.870
 deep down I think it's going around in a loop so we'll end up in 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.329
 pause in a pond 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:25.499
 Tomorrow we showed that we have a go we dominated bruges 

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:29.859
 really really one this setback the moment after the match in matter promosport 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:32.429
 insurance reminds the standard which of course for you as for the team 

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:35.809
 no no it's not a thing for us to put ourselves in the lead now 

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:39.919
 relegated to prob however assured that the match was progressing more important 

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:39.989
 expenses
