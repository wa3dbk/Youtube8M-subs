rice<00:00:59.579> is<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.789> great<00:01:00.030> place<00:01:00.449> everyone<00:01:01.440> here<00:01:01.649> is

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
rice is a great place everyone here is

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.520 
rice is a great place everyone here is
really<00:01:02.010> laid<00:01:02.340> back<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:02.910> fun<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.750> friendly

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
really laid back and fun and friendly

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.469 
really laid back and fun and friendly
and<00:01:04.860> so<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.070> think<00:01:05.250> that<00:01:05.549> it's<00:01:05.700> hard<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.000> be

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
and so I think that it's hard to be

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.840 
and so I think that it's hard to be
unhappy<00:01:07.080> at<00:01:07.200> Rice<00:01:07.380> so<00:01:08.159> this<00:01:08.369> building<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:08.820> a

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
unhappy at Rice so this building is a

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.160 
unhappy at Rice so this building is a
little<00:01:08.909> different<00:01:09.510> from<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.840> rest<00:01:09.990> of<00:01:10.080> the

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
little different from the rest of the

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.080 
little different from the rest of the
campus<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:10.860> see<00:01:11.040> this<00:01:11.159> is<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.340> white<00:01:11.700> color

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
campus so you see this is a white color

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.270 
campus so you see this is a white color
building<00:01:12.600> it's<00:01:12.780> kind<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.080> open<00:01:13.470> so<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:13.710> can<00:01:14.130> just

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
building it's kind of open so I can just

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.030 
building it's kind of open so I can just
bring<00:01:14.430> my<00:01:14.580> laptop<00:01:14.729> focus<00:01:15.420> on<00:01:15.770> some<00:01:16.770> sort<00:01:16.979> of

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
bring my laptop focus on some sort of

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.640 
bring my laptop focus on some sort of
work<00:01:17.250> get<00:01:18.000> my<00:01:18.150> coffee<00:01:18.360> here<00:01:18.689> sit<00:01:19.170> down<00:01:19.200> and

work get my coffee here sit down and

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.260 
work get my coffee here sit down and
just<00:01:20.340> be<00:01:20.610> myself

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
just be myself

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.820 
just be myself
this<00:01:21.659> brand<00:01:21.930> new<00:01:21.990> rec<00:01:22.229> center<00:01:22.500> it's<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.680> pretty

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
this brand new rec center it's a pretty

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.380 
this brand new rec center it's a pretty
big<00:01:23.040> deal<00:01:23.250> there's<00:01:23.549> sunlight<00:01:23.790> all<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.180> time

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
big deal there's sunlight all the time

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.539 
big deal there's sunlight all the time
there's<00:01:24.860> different<00:01:25.860> kinds<00:01:26.009> of<00:01:26.100> people<00:01:26.340> here

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
there's different kinds of people here

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.609 
there's different kinds of people here
so<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.119> guess<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.630> quality<00:01:28.049> of<00:01:28.140> life<00:01:28.350> is

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
so I guess the quality of life is

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.069 
so I guess the quality of life is
amazing<00:01:29.189> because<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:30.150> rice<00:01:30.390> isn't<00:01:30.600> afraid<00:01:30.960> to

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
amazing because the rice isn't afraid to

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.289 
amazing because the rice isn't afraid to
give<00:01:31.530> us<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.920> best<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.549> so<00:01:33.030> they're<00:01:33.180> always
