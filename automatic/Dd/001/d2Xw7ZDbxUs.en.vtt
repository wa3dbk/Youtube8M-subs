 make a pass 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.289
 of three-quarters center offload so so 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.289
 take place 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:41.369
 it was very important political

 period the brock occupation game 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.070
 James is efficient just like defense 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.320
 aggressive third line 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.319

 leicester makes mistakes 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.020
 Parra continues his recital at 0 then very 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.960
 16 to 0 after 34 minutes 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.619

 champion of england 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.820

 7 at half time 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.530
 we think it's just before 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.460
 half-time that hurts us and then 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.480
 that's it's not anyone 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.540
 it's a disciplined team 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.510
 smart who's who these bite 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.980
 until the 80th and benjamin kayzer knows 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.540
 what he's talking about he's worn the jersey 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.120
 of leicester for two seasons 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.910

 vern cotter hours starts at 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.740
 worry 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.200
 his english counterpart richard cockerill 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.390
 former player of clermont already dreaming of a 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.370
 success on his hostile lands and his 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.320
 players will give him hope with 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.750
 this stimulus initiated by the half of 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.760
 scramble yoox the fijian goneva accelerates 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.770
 with the relay and the speed and the 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.240
 three-quarter leicester dominates and takes 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.670
 the ascendancy in this encounter to 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.860
 the unruly auvergnate allows ol 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.810
 williams to continue his faultless 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.340
 20 minutes left clermont no longer 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.040
 that three points advanced the stadium 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.540
 Michelin retains its breath 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.310
 I will do ten minutes of quiet 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.900
 the end of the little end is to be able 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:31.550
 in quotation marks handle the match and one 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.680
 the one has it was the opposite they are 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.100
 he was always brought within reach 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.900
 test so 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.460
 necessarily a lot of pressure from the 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.320
 pressure and nervousness 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.630
 jean marcellin buttin the back 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.820
 Clermont is courageous and does not 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.540
 do not take your eyes off the 120 kg 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.510
 manu tuilagi 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.710
 there is suspense and nervousness that 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.840
 continue the third line of leicester 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.430
 waldron blames himself on this 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:58.110
 grouping and will leave his 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:04:00.900
 teammates at 14 parra was spending the 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:03.030
 penalty 22 to 16 leicester must score 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.590
 try to win clearly penalized 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:08.430
 the English choose the penaltouche 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:10.470
 which looks like a match ball but 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.680
 the heroic defense auvergnate does not crack 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.680
 not 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.470
 this weekend 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.570
 maybe we move forward with a little bit 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.620
 less certainties in the game than 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.790
 the wind but so much better that means 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.710
 we have a simple mask and then 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.880
 so it could have tipped over 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.650
 last action it turns out that our 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.300
 solidarity the public is pushing us so 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.910
 it's really a very good thing rare 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.680
 we will savor his victory 22 to 16 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.990
 clearly without practicing to discuss 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.670
 a third semifinal in a row the 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.910
 michelin stage is a fortress 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.910
 impregnable
