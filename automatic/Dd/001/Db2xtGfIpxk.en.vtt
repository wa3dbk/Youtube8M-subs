 moment out if that should not start 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.960
 In the ringing tone I died taking her 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:28.510
 a minute and a minute 40 for all 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.279
 important is the song may not exceed 40 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:32.379
 be long or ring and then 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.420
 it's also okay then again 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:35.050

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.640

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.260
 on the desktop now you have two 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:48.760
 options either right click on 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.530
 characteristics and if now here the 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.480
 Ending mp4 you could have stood 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.770
 just join the eno and point mpr 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.390
 write down but for me it is 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.219
 not so much from the new 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.300
 itunes version you can not do it all 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:00.100
 make it more easy 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.960
 That's why we need that step 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.720
 we format this from the one of 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.950
 we have to convert a piece of music 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.790
 just with a program to make the 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.229
 is very small 4 mb and that needs 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.240
 also no installation we click 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.740
 once up to download free left 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.350
 the whole time down in the description 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.030
 and now that we have confirmed that here 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.799
 So we have right here right now 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.520
 the realization advantage the ex 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:25.210
 downloaded we open the whole time 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.159
 Can I do that again? 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.920
 make and we can here easily 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:33.100
 import and then select this 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.380
 just from my pc on so here 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:39.310
 It is directly as of now selected 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:41.619
 then we will choose to export 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.079
 the format out that the title no 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.610
 easy but here ringtone he is that 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:49.180
 the format for that heat out and 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.619
 Just click on rough 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.240
 can also export directly to here 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:53.710
 make itunes work that way too 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.530
 we have the checkmark right in there 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.240
 also clean and then just go on 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.340
 the whole thing is done now stands 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.450
 we can finish this finishing 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.920
 okay too and that's where it starts 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.069
 directly we can now look once 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.879
 we're going to hear a sound and here 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.409
 is not in it 

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:12.550
 now we just have our iphone 

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:14.320
 connect and that 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.940
 communicate and I do that now 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.230
 once to show you on how you 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.140
 the iphone then the song as 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.130
 Setting the ring tone can be very important 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.810
 you still have your iphone 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.640
 connect and then I go left here 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.140
 click on the option and then you choose 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.550
 to synchronize the tick at tones 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.860
 otherwise as the sound is not on yours 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.660
 iphone render 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.950
 then you see the screenshot has 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.860
 does it only need the 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.780
 Settings Tones and messages 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.130
 then just adjust the sound brea 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.450
 it's up to you or your friends 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.520
 could even theoretically as well 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.260
 set or do news 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.790
 just as normal as a caller emphasize that 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.790
 It was for today until the next matches 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.610
 league
