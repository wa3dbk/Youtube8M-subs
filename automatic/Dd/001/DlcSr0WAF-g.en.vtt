background<00:00:36.039> on<00:00:36.520> the<00:00:36.640> costs<00:00:37.030> I'm<00:00:37.149> kicking<00:00:37.480> I'm

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:37.660 
background on the costs I'm kicking I'm

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.200 
background on the costs I'm kicking I'm
taking<00:00:38.079> two<00:00:38.530> classes<00:00:38.739> on<00:00:39.219> Tuesday<00:00:39.699> Thursday

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
taking two classes on Tuesday Thursday

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.990 
taking two classes on Tuesday Thursday
and<00:00:40.239> so<00:00:40.629> I<00:00:40.690> am<00:00:41.110> going<00:00:41.350> to<00:00:41.530> combine<00:00:42.100> those<00:00:42.460> in<00:00:42.670> a

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
and so I am going to combine those in a

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.330 
and so I am going to combine those in a
binder<00:00:43.840> so<00:00:43.870> that's<00:00:44.290> why<00:00:44.440> I<00:00:44.470> only<00:00:44.800> have<00:00:45.070> one

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.340 
binder so that's why I only have one

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.550 
binder so that's why I only have one
finder<00:00:45.850> which<00:00:46.270> is<00:00:46.480> right<00:00:46.720> here<00:00:46.750> I<00:00:47.079> guess<00:00:47.230> got<00:00:47.410> a

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:47.560 
finder which is right here I guess got a

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.580 
finder which is right here I guess got a
one<00:00:47.920> inch<00:00:48.190> pink<00:00:48.640> finer<00:00:49.060> that<00:00:49.840> this<00:00:50.140> looks<00:00:50.500> like

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
one inch pink finer that this looks like

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:56.490 
one inch pink finer that this looks like
this<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:55.180> I'm<00:00:55.329> going<00:00:55.630> to<00:00:55.690> combine<00:00:55.930> my<00:00:56.230> two

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
this and I'm going to combine my two

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.130 
this and I'm going to combine my two
classes<00:00:57.070> and<00:00:57.280> this<00:00:57.520> and<00:00:57.790> also<00:00:58.480> I<00:00:58.690> have<00:00:58.989> another

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
classes and this and also I have another

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.110 
classes and this and also I have another
class<00:00:59.559> on<00:00:59.800> Monday<00:01:00.130> Wednesday<00:01:00.309> but<00:01:00.640> I<00:01:00.790> can<00:01:00.970> do

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120

which I thought was so nice of them so

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.380 
which I thought was so nice of them so
it<00:02:33.010> looks<00:02:33.310> like<00:02:33.490> this<00:02:33.700> I<00:02:33.880> think<00:02:33.970> it's<00:02:34.270> the

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
it looks like this I think it's the

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.780 
it looks like this I think it's the
perfect<00:02:34.750> size<00:02:35.200> and<00:02:35.590> inside<00:02:36.040> it's<00:02:36.370> like<00:02:36.580> the

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
perfect size and inside it's like the

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.640 
perfect size and inside it's like the
perfect<00:02:37.090> amount<00:02:37.540> of<00:02:37.660> space<00:02:37.900> for<00:02:37.960> writing<00:02:38.530> down

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
perfect amount of space for writing down

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.410 
perfect amount of space for writing down
all<00:02:38.920> your<00:02:39.010> classes<00:02:39.610> and<00:02:39.820> I<00:02:39.910> think<00:02:40.150> it's<00:02:40.300> just

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
just to kind of organize it better and

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.170 
just to kind of organize it better and
divide<00:05:16.930> up<00:05:17.200> subjects<00:05:17.770> so<00:05:18.040> I<00:05:18.070> have<00:05:18.460> pink<00:05:18.760> orange

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
divide up subjects so I have pink orange

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.510 
divide up subjects so I have pink orange
green<00:05:19.300> purple<00:05:19.840> blue<00:05:20.050> dark<00:05:20.680> green<00:05:20.800> and<00:05:20.980> black

and<00:05:21.940> this<00:05:22.540> little<00:05:22.750> set<00:05:24.090> this<00:05:25.090> might<00:05:25.419> be<00:05:25.630> the

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
and this little set this might be the

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.350 
and this little set this might be the
last<00:05:26.110> thing<00:05:26.440> like<00:05:26.710> God<00:05:27.130> and<00:05:27.460> it's<00:05:27.640> definitely

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
last thing like God and it's definitely

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.900 
last thing like God and it's definitely
the<00:05:28.930> newest<00:05:29.800> thing<00:05:29.979> I've<00:05:30.190> never<00:05:30.460> got<00:05:30.700> this

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:30.910 
the newest thing I've never got this

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.120 
the newest thing I've never got this
before<00:05:31.330> and<00:05:31.540> it<00:05:31.660> is<00:05:31.810> a<00:05:32.080> dry<00:05:32.380> erase<00:05:32.680> board<00:05:32.979> I

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
before and it is a dry erase board I

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.130 
before and it is a dry erase board I
think<00:05:33.400> it's<00:05:33.640> where<00:05:34.060> a<00:05:34.090> locker<00:05:34.450> because<00:05:34.870> it<00:05:34.990> has

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:35.140 
think it's where a locker because it has

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.330 
think it's where a locker because it has
little<00:05:35.410> magnets<00:05:35.919> on<00:05:36.070> it

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340 
little magnets on it

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:37.980 
little magnets on it
but<00:05:36.700> I<00:05:36.940> thought<00:05:37.180> that<00:05:37.240> I<00:05:37.479> really<00:05:37.810> could<00:05:37.960> use

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:37.990 
but I thought that I really could use

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.570 
but I thought that I really could use
this<00:05:38.260> because<00:05:38.620> recently<00:05:38.830> I've<00:05:39.220> been<00:05:39.310> really

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
this because recently I've been really

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.850 
this because recently I've been really
loving<00:05:39.790> to<00:05:40.030> write<00:05:40.240> down<00:05:40.419> things<00:05:40.660> in<00:05:40.930> front<00:05:41.710> of
