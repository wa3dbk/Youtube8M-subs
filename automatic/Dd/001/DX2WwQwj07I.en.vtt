this<00:00:00.750> is<00:00:00.900> a<00:00:00.930> video<00:00:01.290> detailing<00:00:01.829> how<00:00:02.190> my<00:00:02.370> dad<00:00:02.550> is

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
this is a video detailing how my dad is

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.499 
this is a video detailing how my dad is
with<00:00:03.750> the<00:00:03.870> snippet<00:00:04.200> power<00:00:04.380> but<00:00:05.240> first<00:00:06.240> of<00:00:06.390> all

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
with the snippet power but first of all

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.540 
with the snippet power but first of all
I<00:00:06.720> start<00:00:06.990> with<00:00:07.109> the<00:00:07.200> exciter<00:00:07.529> it's<00:00:08.309> got<00:00:08.519> a

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
I start with the exciter it's got a

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.370 
I start with the exciter it's got a
normal<00:00:08.849> bike<00:00:09.030> brake<00:00:09.510> lever<00:00:09.809> accelerator

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
normal bike brake lever accelerator

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.759 
normal bike brake lever accelerator
which<00:00:10.920> just<00:00:11.250> goes<00:00:11.730> along<00:00:11.969> to<00:00:12.269> the<00:00:12.360> back<00:00:12.769> his

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
which just goes along to the back his

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.730 
which just goes along to the back his
left<00:00:13.980> all<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.340> covers<00:00:15.210> on<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.480> engine<00:00:15.809> so

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
left all the covers on the engine so

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.230 
left all the covers on the engine so
this<00:00:16.949> is<00:00:17.100> where<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.369> accelerator<00:00:17.789> one<00:00:17.970> comes

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
this is where the accelerator one comes

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.390 
this is where the accelerator one comes
in<00:00:18.480> he's<00:00:19.080> got<00:00:19.380> this<00:00:19.470> little<00:00:19.650> bracket<00:00:19.859> here<00:00:20.220> on

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
in he's got this little bracket here on

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.970 
in he's got this little bracket here on
this<00:00:21.240> on<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:22.109> handle<00:00:22.470> of<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.740> whipper

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
this on the handle of the whipper

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.710 
this on the handle of the whipper
snipper<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.550> that<00:00:24.210> would<00:00:24.330> be<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.449> normal

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
snipper and that would be the normal

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.420 
snipper and that would be the normal
accelerator<00:00:25.350> handle<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:25.859> you<00:00:25.920> can<00:00:26.099> say<00:00:26.250> that

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
accelerator handle and you can say that

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.660 
accelerator handle and you can say that
he<00:00:26.550> just<00:00:26.730> put<00:00:26.910> that<00:00:27.060> through<00:00:27.570> that<00:00:28.230> little

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
he just put that through that little

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:35.740 
he just put that through that little
trigger<00:00:29.750> so<00:00:30.750> when<00:00:30.900> you<00:00:31.019> pull<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.289> accelerator

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.510 

you<00:00:36.750> can<00:00:36.930> say<00:00:37.110> that<00:00:37.320> it<00:00:37.350> moves<00:00:40.309> next<00:00:41.309> we'll

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
you can say that it moves next we'll

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.340 
you can say that it moves next we'll
just<00:00:41.670> be<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.910> case<00:00:42.090> which<00:00:42.360> it's<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.780> similar

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
just be the case which it's a similar

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.630 
just be the case which it's a similar
setup<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.579> one<00:00:44.730> my<00:00:45.030> green<00:00:45.329> bike<00:00:46.460> just<00:00:47.460> got

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
setup to the one my green bike just got

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.010 
setup to the one my green bike just got
a<00:00:47.840> method<00:00:48.840> for<00:00:48.870> off<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:50.370> put<00:00:50.579> on<00:00:50.930> so<00:00:51.930> I'm

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
a method for off and is put on so I'm

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.660 
a method for off and is put on so I'm
pretty<00:00:52.230> sure<00:00:52.500> it's<00:00:52.649> just<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.920> same<00:00:53.190> yep<00:00:55.670> this

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
pretty sure it's just the same yep this

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.549 
pretty sure it's just the same yep this
way<00:00:56.879> here<00:00:57.180> just<00:00:57.210> goes<00:00:57.570> back<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:57.989> looks<00:00:58.020> up<00:00:58.440> to

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
way here just goes back and looks up to

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.180 
way here just goes back and looks up to
the<00:00:58.620> frame<00:00:58.890> this<00:00:59.850> one<00:01:00.059> here<00:01:00.300> goes<00:01:00.980> to<00:01:01.980> the

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
the frame this one here goes to the

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.920 
the frame this one here goes to the
engine<00:01:03.650> sits<00:01:04.650> yeah<00:01:05.960> it<00:01:06.960> goes<00:01:07.260> up<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:07.860> into<00:01:08.220> the

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
engine sits yeah it goes up and into the

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.380 
engine sits yeah it goes up and into the
the<00:01:09.930> Magneto<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.530> then<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:11.250> can't<00:01:11.970> really<00:01:12.119> tell

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
the Magneto and then I can't really tell

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.609 
the Magneto and then I can't really tell
you<00:01:12.479> much<00:01:12.510> more<00:01:12.840> about<00:01:13.049> it<00:01:13.229> because<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:13.590> have

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
you much more about it because I have

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.719 
you much more about it because I have
the<00:01:13.890> covers<00:01:14.220> off<00:01:14.310> but<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.820> would<00:01:14.939> be<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.180> same

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
the covers off but it would be the same

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:19.100 
the covers off but it would be the same
killing<00:01:17.729> mechanism<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:18.540> have<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.810> migraine

killing mechanism that I have a migraine

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.160 
killing mechanism that I have a migraine
migraine<00:01:20.040> by<00:01:20.570> next<00:01:21.570> will<00:01:21.689> be<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.810> drive

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
migraine by next will be the drive

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.890 
migraine by next will be the drive

isn't<00:01:40.650> actually<00:01:40.829> contacting<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.909> wheel<00:01:42.840> so

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
isn't actually contacting the wheel so

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.039 
isn't actually contacting the wheel so
pull<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:44.369> just<00:01:44.430> spins<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.270> doesn't<00:01:45.960> go

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
pull it and it just spins and doesn't go

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.429 
pull it and it just spins and doesn't go
anywhere<00:01:47.180> now<00:01:48.180> with<00:01:48.360> this<00:01:48.479> little<00:01:48.750> altered

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
anywhere now with this little altered

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.649 
anywhere now with this little altered
brake<00:01:49.799> lever<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:50.970> just<00:01:51.950> undo<00:01:52.950> that<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.659> now

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
brake lever you just undo that and now

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.010 
brake lever you just undo that and now
the<00:01:55.079> spindle<00:01:55.500> has<00:01:55.619> lowered<00:01:56.159> onto<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.579> wheel

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
the spindle has lowered onto the wheel

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.660 
the spindle has lowered onto the wheel
with<00:01:58.020> this<00:01:58.229> this<00:01:58.710> is<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:58.920> detention<00:01:59.340> spring

with this this is a detention spring

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.260 
with this this is a detention spring
and<00:02:01.479> now<00:02:01.720> if<00:02:01.869> I<00:02:01.990> pull<00:02:02.290> it<00:02:02.580> the<00:02:03.580> bike<00:02:03.759> wants<00:02:04.119> to

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
and now if I pull it the bike wants to

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.999 
and now if I pull it the bike wants to
move<00:02:04.450> along<00:02:06.840> it's<00:02:07.840> got<00:02:07.990> these<00:02:08.170> two<00:02:08.440> bolts<00:02:08.739> here

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
move along it's got these two bolts here

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.570 
move along it's got these two bolts here
as<00:02:09.399> a<00:02:09.429> justice<00:02:10.090> as<00:02:10.330> this<00:02:11.200> how<00:02:11.560> far<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:12.099> that

as a justice as this how far the that

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.750 
as a justice as this how far the that
can<00:02:12.880> go<00:02:13.030> down<00:02:13.300> on<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:14.110> wheel<00:02:14.290> it<00:02:15.250> does<00:02:15.550> have

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
can go down on the wheel it does have

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.540 
can go down on the wheel it does have
one<00:02:15.940> problem<00:02:16.270> and<00:02:16.780> that<00:02:17.680> is<00:02:17.860> that<00:02:18.069> when<00:02:18.370> you

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
one problem and that is that when you

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.120 
one problem and that is that when you
lower<00:02:19.000> it<00:02:19.120> down<00:02:19.239> on<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:19.600> wheel<00:02:19.780> that<00:02:20.130> change

lower it down on the wheel that change

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.900 
lower it down on the wheel that change
quite<00:02:21.459> tight<00:02:22.410> so<00:02:23.410> then<00:02:23.680> when<00:02:23.860> you<00:02:24.010> lower<00:02:24.819> it

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
quite tight so then when you lower it

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.900 
quite tight so then when you lower it
off<00:02:25.060> the<00:02:25.239> whip<00:02:25.390> will<00:02:26.220> that<00:02:27.220> chain<00:02:27.550> is<00:02:27.670> quite

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
off the whip will that chain is quite

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.080 
off the whip will that chain is quite
loose<00:02:28.410> it<00:02:29.410> doesn't<00:02:29.769> perform<00:02:29.950> as<00:02:30.340> well<00:02:30.370> as<00:02:30.580> my

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
loose it doesn't perform as well as my

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.199 
loose it doesn't perform as well as my
bike<00:02:31.330> it<00:02:32.290> actually<00:02:32.440> is<00:02:32.650> pretty<00:02:32.860> crap<00:02:33.610> doesn't

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
bike it actually is pretty crap doesn't

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.570 
bike it actually is pretty crap doesn't
even<00:02:34.420> keep<00:02:34.720> you<00:02:34.870> just<00:02:35.830> keeps<00:02:36.040> you<00:02:36.190> going<00:02:36.340> along

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
even keep you just keeps you going along

even keep you just keeps you going along
the<00:02:36.730> flat<00:02:37.860> but<00:02:38.860> possibly<00:02:39.340> due<00:02:39.610> to<00:02:39.640> lack<00:02:40.120> of

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
the flat but possibly due to lack of

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
engine power not enough tension on these

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:51.059 
engine power not enough tension on these
it's<00:02:46.959> quite<00:02:47.230> hard<00:02:47.500> design<00:02:48.330> tip<00:02:49.330> to<00:02:49.540> make<00:02:50.069> it's

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
it's quite hard design tip to make it's

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.250 
it's quite hard design tip to make it's
got<00:02:51.250> all<00:02:51.370> these<00:02:51.610> little<00:02:51.819> members<00:02:52.660> here<00:02:52.989> which

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
got all these little members here which

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.580 
got all these little members here which
had<00:02:53.500> to<00:02:53.590> be<00:02:53.650> welded<00:02:53.920> um<00:02:54.340> I<00:02:54.610> don't<00:02:55.330> think<00:02:55.590> many

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
had to be welded um I don't think many

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.120 
had to be welded um I don't think many
people<00:02:56.709> could<00:02:57.250> make<00:02:57.489> something<00:02:57.790> this<00:02:58.750> good

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
people could make something this good

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.500 
people could make something this good
without<00:03:00.130> a<00:03:00.340> bit<00:03:00.610> of<00:03:00.640> experience<00:03:01.209> in<00:03:01.450> the

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
without a bit of experience in the

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.449 
without a bit of experience in the
metalworking<00:03:01.959> industry<00:03:04.590> that<00:03:05.590> that's

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
metalworking industry that that's

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.060 
metalworking industry that that's
sprocket<00:03:07.000> there's<00:03:07.209> just<00:03:07.570> welded<00:03:08.290> on<00:03:08.410> to<00:03:08.920> that

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:09.070 
sprocket there's just welded on to that

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:14.310 
sprocket there's just welded on to that
nut<00:03:10.709> that's<00:03:12.209> that's<00:03:13.209> just<00:03:13.540> that<00:03:13.810> held<00:03:14.049> on<00:03:14.170> with

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
nut that's that's just that held on with

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:19.229 
nut that's that's just that held on with
that<00:03:14.500> not<00:03:14.920> there<00:03:17.670> next<00:03:18.670> I'll<00:03:18.820> just<00:03:19.000> show<00:03:19.209> you

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
that not there next I'll just show you

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:22.050 
that not there next I'll just show you
how<00:03:19.480> the<00:03:19.540> lowering<00:03:20.019> mechanism<00:03:20.560> works<00:03:21.060> when

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
how the lowering mechanism works when

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.050 
how the lowering mechanism works when
that's<00:03:22.269> in<00:03:22.450> the<00:03:22.570> down<00:03:22.810> position<00:03:23.190> it's<00:03:24.190> pulled

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
that's in the down position it's pulled

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.970 
that's in the down position it's pulled
that<00:03:25.510> thing<00:03:25.870> up<00:03:26.910> which<00:03:27.910> means<00:03:28.120> that<00:03:28.329> it<00:03:28.980> pivots

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
that thing up which means that it pivots

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.900 
that thing up which means that it pivots
on<00:03:30.220> this<00:03:30.820> piece<00:03:31.120> here<00:03:31.570> and<00:03:32.320> then<00:03:33.280> when<00:03:33.519> I<00:03:33.549> lift

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
on this piece here and then when I lift

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.750 
on this piece here and then when I lift
this<00:03:34.000> off<00:03:34.329> its<00:03:34.989> little<00:03:35.290> thing<00:03:35.560> you<00:03:36.400> can<00:03:36.579> see

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
this off its little thing you can see

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.330 
this off its little thing you can see
that<00:03:38.310> it<00:03:39.310> lets<00:03:39.549> it<00:03:39.760> go<00:03:39.880> down<00:03:40.090> and<00:03:41.220> contact<00:03:42.220> the

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
that it lets it go down and contact the

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.539 
that it lets it go down and contact the
wheel<00:03:42.489> it's<00:03:42.640> um<00:03:42.940> probably<00:03:43.660> better<00:03:43.959> if<00:03:44.549> you

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
wheel it's um probably better if you

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:47.880 
wheel it's um probably better if you
wouldn't<00:03:46.239> make<00:03:46.390> one<00:03:46.660> like<00:03:46.810> this<00:03:47.079> it's<00:03:47.650> very

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
wouldn't make one like this it's very

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.870 
wouldn't make one like this it's very
pretty<00:03:48.370> complicated<00:03:49.239> and<00:03:49.420> not<00:03:49.989> that<00:03:50.319> good

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.020 

if<00:03:53.880> I<00:03:54.000> good<00:03:54.270> I<00:03:54.510> mean<00:03:54.870> it's<00:03:55.860> not<00:03:56.010> very<00:03:56.190> good

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
if I good I mean it's not very good

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.820 
if I good I mean it's not very good
performance<00:03:57.270> wise<00:03:57.900> that<00:03:58.170> it's<00:03:58.290> very<00:03:58.500> well

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
performance wise that it's very well

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.050 
performance wise that it's very well
built<00:04:00.050> and<00:04:01.050> in<00:04:01.200> mind<00:04:01.470> great<00:04:02.340> performance<00:04:02.700> wise

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
built and in mind great performance wise

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.900 
built and in mind great performance wise
but<00:04:03.390> it's<00:04:04.290> not<00:04:04.470> very<00:04:04.620> well<00:04:04.890> built<00:04:05.100> whose

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
but it's not very well built whose

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.470 
but it's not very well built whose
things<00:04:06.180> which<00:04:06.830> which<00:04:07.830> aren't<00:04:08.070> very<00:04:08.220> good<00:04:08.480> on

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
things which which aren't very good on
