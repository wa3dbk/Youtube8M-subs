you're probably going to want to use an
assault<00:00:28.800> rifle<00:00:28.859> because<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.820> SMGs<00:00:30.449> in<00:00:30.570> this

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
assault rifle because the SMGs in this

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.040 
assault rifle because the SMGs in this
game<00:00:30.869> doesn't<00:00:31.260> have<00:00:31.590> great<00:00:32.099> range<00:00:32.579> I<00:00:32.940> like<00:00:33.870> the

really<00:00:38.579> good<00:00:38.700> uh<00:00:39.379> for<00:00:40.379> secondary<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:41.340> machine

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
really good uh for secondary the machine

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.410 
really good uh for secondary the machine
pistol<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.210> fmg<00:00:43.110> is<00:00:43.379> an<00:00:44.070> amazing<00:00:44.670> gun<00:00:44.820> if<00:00:45.120> you

haven't checked it out there's a gun
that's<00:00:47.610> kind<00:00:47.879> of<00:00:47.940> like<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.570> PP<00:00:49.020> 90<00:00:49.530> m<00:00:49.680> 1

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
that's kind of like it the PP 90 m 1

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.340 
that's kind of like it the PP 90 m 1
it's<00:00:50.430> literally<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.059> same<00:00:51.539> gun<00:00:51.840> like<00:00:52.050> same

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
it's literally the same gun like same

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.580 
it's literally the same gun like same
clip<00:00:52.649> size<00:00:52.860> kills<00:00:53.430> people<00:00:53.699> just<00:00:53.910> as<00:00:54.059> fast<00:00:54.270> a

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
clip size kills people just as fast a

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.849 
clip size kills people just as fast a
bit<00:00:55.590> better<00:00:55.770> range<00:00:56.190> but<00:00:56.370> that's<00:00:56.699> about<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:57.000> um

00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:57.859 
bit better range but that's about it um

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:01.279 
bit better range but that's about it um
so<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:59.309> highly<00:01:00.270> suggest<00:01:00.510> using<00:01:00.840> that<00:01:01.079> and

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
so I highly suggest using that and

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.380 
so I highly suggest using that and
getting<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.890> red<00:01:02.460> dot<00:01:02.579> sight<00:01:02.820> on<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.120> because

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
getting the red dot sight on it because

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.550 
getting the red dot sight on it because
the<00:01:03.989> iron<00:01:04.229> sights<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.650> not<00:01:04.830> that<00:01:05.010> great<00:01:05.220> a

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
the iron sights and not that great a

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.310 
the iron sights and not that great a
lethal<00:01:07.560> grenade<00:01:07.860> I<00:01:08.070> used<00:01:08.250> semtex<00:01:08.700> and

tactical you should always use
concussion<00:01:11.460> grenades<00:01:11.700> because<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:11.970> can

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
concussion grenades because you can

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.300 
concussion grenades because you can
throw<00:01:12.240> them<00:01:12.330> faster<00:01:12.750> as<00:01:12.900> for<00:01:13.500> perks<00:01:13.710> uh

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.920 
off the radar permanently the second one
is<00:02:01.770> sleight<00:02:02.219> of<00:02:02.250> hand<00:02:02.490> pro<00:02:02.549> which<00:02:02.880> is<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.119> really

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
is sleight of hand pro which is a really

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.200 
is sleight of hand pro which is a really
important<00:02:04.469> perk<00:02:04.680> if<00:02:04.920> you're<00:02:05.670> not<00:02:05.759> using<00:02:06.000> it

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
important perk if you're not using it

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.300 
important perk if you're not using it
but<00:02:06.360> i<00:02:06.570> believe<00:02:06.689> that<00:02:06.960> takes<00:02:07.439> place<00:02:07.649> of<00:02:07.979> what

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
but i believe that takes place of what

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.400 
but i believe that takes place of what
perfect<00:02:08.670> let's<00:02:08.879> see<00:02:09.060> of<00:02:09.410> extreme

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
perfect let's see of extreme

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.020 
perfect let's see of extreme
conditioning<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.099> extreme<00:02:11.370> conditioning<00:02:11.910> is

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
conditioning and extreme conditioning is

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.380 
conditioning and extreme conditioning is
really<00:02:12.300> important<00:02:12.870> because

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
really important because

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.050 
really important because
rushing<00:02:13.900> I<00:02:14.050> guess<00:02:14.319> in<00:02:14.530> general<00:02:14.890> and<00:02:15.069> you<00:02:15.819> want

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
rushing I guess in general and you want

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.940 
rushing I guess in general and you want
to<00:02:16.120> get<00:02:16.240> want<00:02:16.540> to<00:02:16.630> get<00:02:16.720> it<00:02:16.810> a<00:02:17.020> kill<00:02:17.350> as<00:02:17.500> fast<00:02:17.800> as

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
to get want to get it a kill as fast as

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.240 
to get want to get it a kill as fast as
you<00:02:18.040> can<00:02:18.190> in<00:02:18.370> this<00:02:18.430> game<00:02:19.050> so<00:02:20.050> and<00:02:20.530> then<00:02:20.740> for<00:02:21.160> the

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
you can in this game so and then for the

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.580 
you can in this game so and then for the
final<00:02:21.550> one<00:02:21.670> I<00:02:21.910> chose<00:02:22.150> quick-draw<00:02:22.750> because<00:02:23.200> i

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
final one I chose quick-draw because i

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.520 
final one I chose quick-draw because i
don't<00:02:24.250> know<00:02:24.310> i<00:02:24.340> really<00:02:24.760> like<00:02:25.230> aiming<00:02:26.230> faster

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
don't know i really like aiming faster

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.890 
don't know i really like aiming faster
than<00:02:26.650> my<00:02:26.740> site<00:02:26.920> it<00:02:27.310> feels<00:02:27.580> slower<00:02:28.209> aiming<00:02:28.720> than

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
than my site it feels slower aiming than

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.650 
than my site it feels slower aiming than
it<00:02:29.020> does<00:02:29.170> in<00:02:29.200> modern<00:02:29.770> warfare<00:02:29.830> 2<00:02:30.250> I<00:02:30.970> don't<00:02:31.570> know

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
it does in modern warfare 2 I don't know

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.170 
it does in modern warfare 2 I don't know
why<00:02:31.840> that<00:02:32.050> is<00:02:32.340> but<00:02:33.340> some<00:02:33.640> of<00:02:33.730> you<00:02:33.820> may<00:02:34.000> prefer

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
why that is but some of you may prefer

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.540 
why that is but some of you may prefer
to<00:02:34.420> pick<00:02:34.540> blind<00:02:34.870> eye<00:02:35.050> in<00:02:35.290> which<00:02:35.550> your

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
to pick blind eye in which your

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.220 
to pick blind eye in which your
undetectable<00:02:37.209> by<00:02:37.360> air<00:02:37.630> support<00:02:38.080> and

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
undetectable by air support and

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.190 
undetectable by air support and
centuries<00:02:39.270> mainly<00:02:40.270> because<00:02:40.390> once<00:02:40.930> you<00:02:41.020> get

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
centuries mainly because once you get

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.290 
centuries mainly because once you get
like<00:02:41.320> a<00:02:41.350> kill<00:02:41.650> a<00:02:41.920> six<00:02:42.280> kill<00:02:42.550> streak<00:02:42.850> you're<00:02:43.180> not

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
like a kill a six kill streak you're not

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.880 
like a kill a six kill streak you're not
going<00:02:43.450> to<00:02:43.510> want<00:02:43.660> to<00:02:43.780> die<00:02:43.959> because<00:02:44.350> also<00:02:44.709> if<00:02:44.800> you

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
going to want to die because also if you

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.470 
going to want to die because also if you
get<00:02:45.040> an<00:02:45.130> eight<00:02:45.310> you<00:02:45.520> get<00:02:45.670> a<00:02:45.700> perk<00:02:46.209> that<00:02:46.360> the

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
get an eight you get a perk that the

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.910 
get an eight you get a perk that the
game<00:02:46.630> randomly<00:02:47.140> chooses<00:02:47.470> that<00:02:47.620> you<00:02:47.739> don't

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
game randomly chooses that you don't

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.160 
game randomly chooses that you don't
have<00:02:48.100> so<00:02:48.670> by<00:02:48.790> the<00:02:48.850> end<00:02:48.970> at<00:02:49.300> eight<00:02:49.480> kills<00:02:49.780> you're

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
have so by the end at eight kills you're

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.390 
have so by the end at eight kills you're
going<00:02:50.350> to<00:02:50.410> have<00:02:50.530> basically<00:02:50.890> every<00:02:51.130> part<00:02:51.310> in

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
going to have basically every part in

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.820 
going to have basically every part in
the<00:02:51.459> game<00:02:51.640> so<00:02:52.269> with<00:02:52.480> blind<00:02:52.959> eye<00:02:53.110> and<00:02:53.140> assassin

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
the game so with blind eye and assassin

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.020 
the game so with blind eye and assassin
there's<00:02:54.070> no<00:02:55.000> way<00:02:55.180> that<00:02:55.739> UAVs<00:02:56.739> portable<00:02:57.489> radars

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
there's no way that UAVs portable radars

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.229 
there's no way that UAVs portable radars
thermals<00:02:58.660> heartbeat<00:02:59.110> sensors<00:02:59.530> and<00:03:00.239> basically

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:01.239 
thermals heartbeat sensors and basically

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.120 
thermals heartbeat sensors and basically
anything<00:03:01.660> can<00:03:01.959> see<00:03:02.170> you<00:03:02.320> and<00:03:02.530> it<00:03:02.650> gives<00:03:02.980> you<00:03:03.100> a

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
anything can see you and it gives you a

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.370 
anything can see you and it gives you a
huge<00:03:03.430> advantage<00:03:03.640> I<00:03:04.239> really<00:03:04.930> like<00:03:05.080> this<00:03:05.230> I

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:05.380 
huge advantage I really like this I

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.479 
huge advantage I really like this I
think<00:03:05.440> it's<00:03:05.680> the<00:03:06.160> most<00:03:06.310> under<00:03:06.730> user<00:03:08.489> underused

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
think it's the most under user underused

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.090 
think it's the most under user underused
strike<00:03:10.180> package<00:03:10.540> in<00:03:10.690> the<00:03:10.780> game<00:03:10.930> so<00:03:11.140> far<00:03:11.350> it's<00:03:12.040> a

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
strike package in the game so far it's a

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.830 
strike package in the game so far it's a
bit<00:03:12.310> nooby<00:03:12.550> I<00:03:12.910> think<00:03:13.239> most<00:03:13.420> people<00:03:13.660> are<00:03:13.720> going

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
bit nooby I think most people are going

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.150 
bit nooby I think most people are going
to<00:03:13.930> go<00:03:13.989> with<00:03:14.110> the<00:03:14.200> soul<00:03:14.410> and<00:03:14.620> then<00:03:14.769> people<00:03:15.040> that

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
to go with the soul and then people that

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.320 
to go with the soul and then people that
aren't<00:03:15.459> really<00:03:15.580> good<00:03:15.820> at<00:03:15.910> the<00:03:16.000> game<00:03:16.030> are<00:03:16.209> going

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
aren't really good at the game are going

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.110 
aren't really good at the game are going
to<00:03:16.390> go<00:03:16.480> with<00:03:16.540> support<00:03:17.019> but<00:03:17.730> it's<00:03:18.730> a<00:03:18.790> lot<00:03:18.970> of<00:03:19.000> fun

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
to go with support but it's a lot of fun

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.940 
to go with support but it's a lot of fun
you<00:03:19.420> should<00:03:19.570> check<00:03:19.720> it<00:03:19.840> out<00:03:19.930> thanks<00:03:20.860> for
