00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:09.000
 after the Japanese to invade 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.480
 global automobile market have 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 the Korean history repeated itself 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.100
 confidence at the beginning lack of age 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.260
 when it is good thing to 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.539
 verification of product quality 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.630
 a good example of this is the hyundai tucson 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.699
 v6 midsize sports utility vehicle 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.640
 which faces equal to equal the 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:34.739
 competitors and on top has five 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.600
 years of guaranteeing the 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.960
 the typhoon already stands out in the landscape 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.540
 Brazilian motifs is also the design 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.719
 inspired many category icons 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.590
 other hang sport is a good space 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.200
 internal 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.680
 just take a look at five people really 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.140
 walk comfortable even believe 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.190
 who sits here in the middle but not everything is 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.320
 Perfect 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:03.149
 5 is not three points to increase 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.640
 even more the comfort of those who sit 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.610
 rear seat backrest 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.729
 this party is reclining or can be 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.189
 folded forward 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:16.830
 with 325 liters of luggage. 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.979
 capacity is not among the largest 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:23.340
 the call though simple is to win 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.860
 with clear colors organ pleasant environment 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.930
 besides tempting to be bigger 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.119
 but some members like 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.920
 on- board computer and 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.470
 parking facilities to facilitate 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.800
 ipi maneuvers that are already commonplace 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.200
 charges for this category 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.930
 everything is well equipped with air 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.780
 digital conditioning and sound with cd 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.580
 electric trio player and controller 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.940
 speed automatic 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:53.540
 the version we tested on lf has a motor 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:56.510
 v6 of good 180 horsepower 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:59.390
 the four-speed automatic transmission 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.810
 but life is not smooth operation and to 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.400
 allow sequential shifts in the lever 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.380
 disappoint by car category 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.649
 should have some management 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:13.220
 electronics such as reduce alone and 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.260
 five - speed gearbox 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.640
 males would also welcome 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.040
 I wanted to improve performance 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.020
 mainly in accelerations and 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.840
 speed resets 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:26.210
 clear that everything has been thought to be more 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.790
 used than adventurers but with a 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.980
 egypt all utilities 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.860
 sports could not fail to have 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.680
 four-wheel drive system uses a 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.840
 of automatic permanent traction ie 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.770
 Attraction was good to win on wheels 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.709
 front 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.680
 if any of the rap automatically 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.450
 rear wheels will also work 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.330
 it just does not have the box reduced has been 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.100
 more radical use, but it is 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.370
 four-wheel drive. 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:59.320
 permanent and it helps to face a 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.320
 bolder adventure 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.550
 in compensation the stability of the tunnel 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.860
 a pleasant surprise beyond traction 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.730
 on the four wheels that acts at the 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.100
 critics 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.530
 the suspension a firmer quality 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:20.239
 allows the car to make sharp turns 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:22.459
 well and despite the height does not lean too much 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:25.100
 the body collaborating in the sensation of 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:28.910
 security and you think because of 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:32.630
 that car is noisy cheating your 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:35.330
 walking on poor floor or pavement is 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:39.650
 quiet and make a good sense of 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:41.420
 robustness and by 63 to disk in the four 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.930
 wheels with open 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:47.060
 direction mark and need to behave again 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.900
 besides a good and high prohibition of 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.420
 to drive 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:52.640
 we are boston women also help 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:56.500
 explaining the Korean craft is 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.500
 making it from us 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:04.489
 second emilio hyundai tucson v6 gls has 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:08.570
 from positive internal space to 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:11.900
 stability and guarantee the negative 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:15.110
 security exchange and a fox bag 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:18.320
 the hyundai tucson v6 gls like that 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:20.840
 we tested it from 104 thousand 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:27.640
 nine hundred and seventy reais to know
