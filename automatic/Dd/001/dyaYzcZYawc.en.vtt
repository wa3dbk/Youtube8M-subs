00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:11.219
 Hello and welcome again 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.530
 show new video of us today there is 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.630
 the speed comparison between the iphone 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.640
 5 first and the samsung galaxy s 4 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.770
 I'll show you now first of all 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.180
 times that opened in the multitasking mix 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.810
 is that there is no distinction 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.080
 can come 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.720
 at iphone 4s we see here already 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.760
 everything closed 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.560
 and everything is closed here as well 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.480
 good that now so first switch 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:40.410
 now for the first time from going here before 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:42.000
 in this menu and at s 44 to 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.850
 I turn off already 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.440
 switch off and then I see already 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.610
 times over and wide 21 and flowed that 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.350
 second time down 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.879
 then we already see who as 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.930
 first otherwise I think that's 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:00.109
 let's say it's four 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:02.609
 because the 5 it still loads around here 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:05.309
 Let's wait until both are completely down 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.140
 There are four of them already 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.119
 a few dates on it that five it that 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.710
 is still completely new plant so that 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.840
 we came very close that is 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.080
 Definitely so I good ones 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.830
 quite simply times both devices short old 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.689
 willow is pressed tackle 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.500
 at iphone 4s we already see that was 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.020
 a little faster 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.939
 the galaxy's fourth needs something 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.490
 longer until there is a reaction 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.670
 assume that it should book then look 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:38.759
 we win now we see that 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:40.740
 galaxy s 4 is already going on and that 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.390
 iphone 5 it's a bit faster up 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.520
 as I said it is also still 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.409
 completely empty because it might be too 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.700
 small differences I come 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.840
 just unlock it all now 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.340
 shortly then it continues 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.930
 I just open it, I think 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.700
 the browser that we already see 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.250
 if you see a small difference 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.210
 him here at the iphone safari 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.460
 chrome 3 2 1 and they are actually 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.350
 open at the same time 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.790
 may be something behind 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.320
 then I'll go to the page 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.000
 mirror there you can always see it 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.910
 very good because the data loaded 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.319
 Need to become 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:22.349
 spiegel.de 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:24.180
 I have to say that here as well 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:25.499
 I just have the whole browser 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.159
 so right away so that 

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:33.450
 also no differences come 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:34.889
 open twice and so here in the 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.670
 case, the iphone is definitely whole 

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:37.620
 clearly faster 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.180
 we are both in the same wlan and that 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.829
 iphone has loaded much faster 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.719
 I 'm just doing the test like that 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:44.609
 how fluid the whole thing is 

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:46.200
 I think I just think that on the 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:48.120
 that's why it's short 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:53.370
 so gone in any case very much 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:56.280
 liquid on the iphone almost a small one 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.629
 tick liquid if at all so one 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.579
 does not notice any differences here 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:02.930
 We'll open it soon 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:08.540
 camera for example, she was then me 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:08.540
 we have the camera and up here 3 2 1 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:14.699
 at the 3 of 5 than faster again 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.959
 loaded with the trigger can now be very 

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:19.609
 bad show but there I have to say 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:23.669
 they do not give each other much 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:25.409
 and generally the android it always lies 

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:27.720
 somewhat behind that one has when it 5 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:29.159
 This is definitely not the case 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.239
 but I think all android generation 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:30.900
 always a bit of a case 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.639
 been 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.989
 that's why you can not do it here directly 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:36.959
 make comparisons then we had to 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.359
 For example, never in the case here 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.310
 just hold down 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:44.189
 it immediately appears here it is the 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.750
 double happiness also appears immediately 

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:48.139
 maybe a little bit 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.139
 needed longer 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:54.629
 Let's try it all the way 

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:56.250
 an app where you can compare like that 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:57.719
 I'll just invite you here for a short time 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.669
 yes also so that no apps open here 

00:03:57.719 --> 00:04:01.199
 are the whole you again briefly 

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:03.629
 we have nothing open because I go 

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:06.540
 Just time out that time 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:10.289
 a chad mcknight i just open it 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:15.150
 at the same time 123 times look who 

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:16.709
 Loaded here first has been curious 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.280
 the bills do not believe themselves now 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.049
 a lot of 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.090
 the album and better a little one 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:23.699
 tick faster but otherwise 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:28.560
 that was not exactly the same you are moving 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:30.380
 There is also a run on germany 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.550
 no differences 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.290
 yes that was it already too 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.110
 the speed comparison knows 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.400
 now have other questions or something 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.810
 how it looks with the differences 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.220
 from the speed or other 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.600
 just want to see videos subscribed 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.520
 our channel there are still many 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.470
 other comparative videos with the 5 1 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.830
 or other videos yes and up to 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.830
 next time
