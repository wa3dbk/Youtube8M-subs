00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.819
 reservations and only 

00:00:11.819 --> 00:00:16.320
 on the part of the residents of our era made in for third 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.409
 betting on what they are with the owner of the property 

00:00:21.409 --> 00:00:24.720
 also changed the vision of the business announced 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.899
 required 

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:29.259
 to reverse this renewal of mandates 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:33.760
 we would give everything was to make an evaluation of the first 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.760
 one of the voices of Ferreira I

 same day but in fact we have not been top not marked 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.580
 he nevertheless 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.060
 for his place but only for the moment 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.130
 only thing we really want a cancellation 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:52.840
 this auction 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.050
 so you can remove sand 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.050

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.730
 and so she can really be here in the ct king pee is that what 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:04.880
 I really wanted 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.740
 ended up going to the auction 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.670
 something we did not expect 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.000
 and we have several arguments 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 so he actually asks that he not be canceled 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:17.050
 looks 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.680
 life 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.680

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.990

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.260

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.670

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.520
