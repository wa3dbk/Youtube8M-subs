 of his boots 

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:18.259
 Road tourism repeated the economic crisis of the beginning of the new century 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:23.039
 fish and peeked to its most successful time in terms of movement participants 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.220
 and repercussion 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.150
 definitely settled freelancers the ts moves federalist criterion 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.180
 for the country visiting conceived as Galician river jumped inns consolidating 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.370
 places like parana or san luis without neglecting the circuits more 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.930
 traditions of the province of buenos aires and watching the party permanently 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.840
 the buenos aires race track, the stage most traveled by the 

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:48.839
 category in its seven decades of competition 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.550
 the cars have also adapted to the new demands that force them to lower 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.859
 weight and locate the center 

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:55.640
 the idea of ​​age 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.790
 as close as possible to the asphalt 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.850
 at maximum speed it stopped being determinant as it was while the one 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.330
 it ran on the long straight but semi-permanent 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.470
 now it is as important as that the speed in curve to such an extent that 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.140
 those who bend almost completely in the curvón salotto impress thanks to 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.140
 the advances in suspensions and tuning 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.710
 if the urgencies of the fast mechanics and two companions were transformed into 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.440
 Privileged time takers in the armchair next door but the traditions 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.060
 they are not immortal 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.520
 and at this stage 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.240
 where security is the key 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.430
 the companions had to get off more safety and with less weight more 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.130
 speed in curve 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.270
 those new cars no longer need to be heirs of series cars if they do not 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.220
 respect the original measurements and the silhouettes 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.990
 tubular chassis emitter is covered by bodies that follow the line 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.460
 original but only retained by the Chinese manufacturer rear fender 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:55.920
 only for the chevrolet 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.760
 keeps the original engine 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:58.780
 2 and torino 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.330
 I will use more modern txeroki 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.700
 it is not strange to find 20 and up to 30 cars included in the same second of the 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.820
 author of the pole position on the Saturday before each race 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:11.189
 in the era of the teams 

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:13.549
 a superior version of professionalism 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:16.210
 and unlike the years of traverse hotel and 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:21.100
 which has a different champion every year for a lustrum ernesto 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.690
 bessone in 2003 omar martínez in 2004 juan manuel silva in 2005 and norberto 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.059
 fontana in 2006 

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:30.079
 and everything points to this year 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.739
 the 70th anniversary will be another champion 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:39.029
 it is not strange to find 60 thousand souls in a competition as it happened 

00:02:39.029 --> 00:02:43.329
 in the thousandth career of road tourism held in August 2003 in 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:47.789
 the parana circuit four years ago the scenarios changed the 

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:52.409
 conditions also but love remains unchanged as of 70 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:53.189
 years 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:58.389
 a life but I also feel tens of hundreds of souls that during a 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:02.819
 the time an engine is turned on and the motor of the road tourism is already in 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.819
 seeks the uninterrupted century of passion 

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:22.059
 the act
