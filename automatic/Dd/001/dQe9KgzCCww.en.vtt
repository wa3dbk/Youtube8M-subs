for third same different fights I battle

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.949 
for third same different fights I battle
for<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:28.040> overall<00:02:28.700> right<00:02:29.150> now<00:02:29.300> canard<00:02:29.750> would

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
for the overall right now canard would

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.540 
for the overall right now canard would
have<00:02:30.200> third<00:02:30.560> overall<00:02:30.860> when<00:02:31.070> we<00:02:31.130> combine<00:02:31.430> the

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
have third overall when we combine the

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.670 
have third overall when we combine the
first<00:02:31.730> moto<00:02:32.030> from<00:02:32.510> earlier<00:02:32.840> today<00:02:33.110> but<00:02:33.470> we

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
first moto from earlier today but we

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.970 
first moto from earlier today but we
have<00:02:33.709> going<00:02:34.130> on<00:02:34.250> now<00:02:34.430> but<00:02:35.060> I<00:02:35.510> think<00:02:36.380> this<00:02:36.770> could

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
have going on now but I think this could

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.440 
have going on now but I think this could
be<00:02:37.010> enough<00:02:37.400> to<00:02:37.580> tip<00:02:37.790> it<00:02:37.970> in<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:38.239> other

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
be enough to tip it in the other

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.660 
be enough to tip it in the other
direction<00:02:38.570> if<00:02:39.230> Tomac<00:02:39.590> is<00:02:39.620> able<00:02:39.980> to<00:02:40.069> make<00:02:40.310> that

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.530 
earlier rally outside he runs it
so<00:03:20.290> it<00:03:20.470> gets<00:03:20.590> a<00:03:20.740> little<00:03:20.950> off-center<00:03:21.420> can<00:03:22.420> I

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
so it gets a little off-center can I

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.520 
so it gets a little off-center can I
hold<00:03:22.840> that<00:03:22.990> line

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
hold that line

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.490 
hold that line
Timex<00:03:23.950> wears<00:03:24.340> it<00:03:24.490> up<00:03:24.580> watch<00:03:24.790> can<00:03:25.090> he<00:03:25.180> like

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
Timex wears it up watch can he like

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.420 
Timex wears it up watch can he like
square<00:03:26.500> them<00:03:26.650> up<00:03:26.710> the<00:03:26.860> inside<00:03:27.160> to<00:03:27.280> get<00:03:27.400> a

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
square them up the inside to get a

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.240 
square them up the inside to get a
handful<00:03:27.790> of<00:03:27.910> the<00:03:28.060> gas<00:03:28.470> that<00:03:29.470> inside<00:03:29.890> I<00:03:29.920> still

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
handful of the gas that inside I still

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.230 
handful of the gas that inside I still
think<00:03:30.520> is<00:03:30.640> the<00:03:30.760> premier<00:03:31.210> line<00:03:31.390> that<00:03:31.710> corner<00:03:32.710> so

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.240 
think is the premier line that corner so

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.440 
think is the premier line that corner so
Tomac

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
Tomac

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.300 
Tomac
it's<00:03:34.660> going<00:03:34.900> to<00:03:34.990> have<00:03:35.110> to<00:03:35.260> build<00:03:35.500> and<00:03:35.770> remount

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
it's going to have to build and remount

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.300 
it's going to have to build and remount
another<00:03:36.880> challenge<00:03:37.390> because<00:03:38.160> that's<00:03:39.160> what

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
another challenge because that's what

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.440 
another challenge because that's what
that's<00:03:39.520> what<00:03:39.700> takes<00:03:39.910> because<00:03:40.210> right<00:03:40.420> here

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:40.450 
that's what takes because right here

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.230 
that's what takes because right here
they're<00:03:41.410> very<00:03:41.620> similar<00:03:41.950> unless<00:03:42.910> someone

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:43.240 
they're very similar unless someone

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.360 
they're very similar unless someone
makes<00:03:43.390> a<00:03:43.540> major<00:03:43.720> mistake<00:03:43.930> but<00:03:44.770> Tomac<00:03:45.160> is

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
makes a major mistake but Tomac is

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.210 
makes a major mistake but Tomac is
lurking<00:03:46.180> so<00:03:46.420> if<00:03:46.990> he<00:03:47.200> finds<00:03:47.650> the<00:03:47.770> right<00:03:47.950> line

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
lurking so if he finds the right line

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.280 
lurking so if he finds the right line
the<00:03:48.460> right<00:03:48.640> time<00:03:48.940> he<00:03:49.390> will<00:03:49.600> make<00:03:49.810> that<00:03:49.840> pass

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
the right time he will make that pass

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.500 
the right time he will make that pass
it's<00:03:51.040> he's<00:03:51.220> putting<00:03:51.580> massive<00:03:51.970> pressure<00:03:52.240> but

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
it's he's putting massive pressure but

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.510 
it's he's putting massive pressure but
let's<00:03:53.050> take<00:03:53.230> nothing<00:03:53.590> away<00:03:53.620> from<00:03:53.740> Trey<00:03:54.100> Canard

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:54.520
