00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.170 
talked about before and there's a couple
of<00:02:00.869> theories<00:02:01.170> I<00:02:01.619> think<00:02:02.030> crossing<00:02:03.030> the

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
of theories I think crossing the

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.040 
of theories I think crossing the
breviary<00:02:03.479> they're<00:02:04.310> clearly<00:02:05.310> in<00:02:05.670> breach

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.050 
breviary they're clearly in breach

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.430 
breviary they're clearly in breach
crossing<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:07.950> river<00:02:08.160> there<00:02:08.400> and<00:02:08.690> yes<00:02:09.690> so<00:02:10.170> I

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
crossing the river there and yes so I

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.470 
crossing the river there and yes so I
know<00:02:10.680> you<00:02:10.830> didn't<00:02:11.790> know<00:02:11.820> it's<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.000> hummingbird

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
know you didn't know it's a hummingbird

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.050 
know you didn't know it's a hummingbird
OCA<00:02:12.930> unicom<00:02:13.380> but<00:02:13.500> no<00:02:13.590> it's<00:02:13.710> a<00:02:13.740> hummingbird<00:02:14.310> so

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
OCA unicom but no it's a hummingbird so

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.660 
OCA unicom but no it's a hummingbird so
