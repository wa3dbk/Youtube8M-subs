00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:22.200 
madcatz yeah they're not that

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.740 
madcatz yeah they're not that
interesting<00:00:22.770> I<00:00:22.980> mean<00:00:23.670> otherwise<00:00:23.970> I<00:00:24.450> would<00:00:24.660> do

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
interesting I mean otherwise I would do

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.000 
interesting I mean otherwise I would do
them<00:00:24.870> separately<00:00:25.110> I<00:00:25.410> don't<00:00:25.620> usually<00:00:25.740> do

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
them separately I don't usually do

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.680 
them separately I don't usually do
things<00:00:26.220> together<00:00:26.370> like<00:00:26.580> this<00:00:26.910> but<00:00:27.360> what<00:00:27.510> I

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:27.690 
things together like this but what I

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:28.700 
things together like this but what I
mean<00:00:27.840> how<00:00:27.960> much<00:00:28.050> mine<00:00:28.290> really<00:00:28.500> supposed<00:00:28.680> to

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
mean how much mine really supposed to

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.860 
mean how much mine really supposed to
say<00:00:28.890> about<00:00:29.070> these<00:00:29.250> things<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:30.060> memory<00:00:30.360> cards

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:30.870 
say about these things the memory cards

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.560 
say about these things the memory cards
here's<00:00:31.590> them<00:00:31.770> compared<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.129> a<00:00:32.219> VM<00:00:32.460> you<00:00:32.669> at

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
here's them compared to a VM you at

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.630 
here's them compared to a VM you at
least<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.780> VM<00:00:34.019> use<00:00:34.140> interesting<00:00:34.620> look<00:00:35.399> it's

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
least the VM use interesting look it's

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.310 
least the VM use interesting look it's
got<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.789> screen<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.300> d-pad<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:36.749> you<00:00:37.230> know

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
got a screen and a d-pad and you know

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.849 
got a screen and a d-pad and you know
buttons<00:00:37.710> this<00:00:38.339> is<00:00:38.460> cool<00:00:38.699> this<00:00:39.239> is<00:00:39.359> not<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:39.659> cool

00:00:39.849 --> 00:00:39.859 
buttons this is cool this is not so cool

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:43.340 
buttons this is cool this is not so cool
this<00:00:40.859> has<00:00:41.039> like<00:00:41.249> no<00:00:41.489> real<00:00:41.820> advantage<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.539> mean<00:00:43.109> I

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
this has like no real advantage I mean I

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.349 
this has like no real advantage I mean I
would<00:00:43.559> say<00:00:43.739> it<00:00:43.829> one<00:00:43.980> time<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.999> might<00:00:45.179> have<00:00:45.269> been

00:00:45.349 --> 00:00:45.359 
would say it one time it might have been

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:46.939 
would say it one time it might have been
oh<00:00:45.570> these<00:00:45.749> are<00:00:45.899> cheaper<00:00:46.260> but<00:00:46.530> now<00:00:46.620> these<00:00:46.800> would

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:46.949 
oh these are cheaper but now these would

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:48.319 
oh these are cheaper but now these would
actually<00:00:47.190> be<00:00:47.280> like<00:00:47.309> harder<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.789> find<00:00:48.059> than<00:00:48.269> a

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
actually be like harder to find than a

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.500 
actually be like harder to find than a
VM<00:00:48.569> you<00:00:49.219> probably<00:00:50.219> they<00:00:50.699> may<00:00:50.879> actually<00:00:51.120> still

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
VM you probably they may actually still

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.059 
VM you probably they may actually still
be<00:00:51.629> cheaper<00:00:51.899> but<00:00:52.140> you're<00:00:52.289> talking<00:00:52.530> like<00:00:52.589> ooh<00:00:52.859> a

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:53.069 
be cheaper but you're talking like ooh a

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:55.759 
be cheaper but you're talking like ooh a
dollar<00:00:53.519> versus<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.239> know<00:00:54.269> a<00:00:54.569> dollar<00:00:55.289> fifty

00:00:55.759 --> 00:00:55.769 
dollar versus you know a dollar fifty

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:59.270 
dollar versus you know a dollar fifty
get<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.699> VM<00:00:56.999> you<00:00:57.149> this<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:57.839> better<00:00:58.019> I<00:00:58.350> mean<00:00:58.920> one

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
get the VM you this is better I mean one

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.379 
get the VM you this is better I mean one
other<00:00:59.429> thing<00:00:59.639> that's<00:00:59.819> better<00:00:59.969> about<00:01:00.239> this

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:00.389 
other thing that's better about this

00:01:00.389 --> 00:01:02.149 
other thing that's better about this
thing<00:01:00.659> is<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:01.499> there's<00:01:01.769> actually<00:01:01.949> a

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:02.159 
thing is that there's actually a

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:03.979 
thing is that there's actually a
savefile<00:01:02.489> out<00:01:03.030> there<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.389> can<00:01:03.510> put<00:01:03.690> on<00:01:03.809> this

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
savefile out there you can put on this

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.950 
savefile out there you can put on this
thing<00:01:04.050> that<00:01:04.470> will<00:01:05.040> unlock<00:01:05.519> extra<00:01:06.299> space<00:01:06.600> on<00:01:06.810> it

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
thing that will unlock extra space on it

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.620 
thing that will unlock extra space on it
once<00:01:07.799> sega<00:01:08.100> designed<00:01:08.430> these<00:01:08.579> they<00:01:09.270> came<00:01:09.600> out

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
once sega designed these they came out

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.050 
once sega designed these they came out
with<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.930> block<00:01:10.439> system<00:01:10.799> that<00:01:11.520> was<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.790> memory

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
with a block system that was the memory

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.840 
with a block system that was the memory
type<00:01:12.299> it<00:01:12.630> was<00:01:13.170> kind<00:01:14.009> of<00:01:14.070> like<00:01:14.219> you<00:01:14.490> know<00:01:14.520> their

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
type it was kind of like you know their

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.880 
type it was kind of like you know their
version<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.329> megabytes<00:01:15.930> or<00:01:16.079> kilobytes<00:01:16.500> their

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
version of megabytes or kilobytes their

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.100 
version of megabytes or kilobytes their
system<00:01:17.219> was<00:01:17.280> called<00:01:17.460> blocks<00:01:17.729> they<00:01:18.479> had<00:01:18.570> 200<00:01:19.049> of

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
system was called blocks they had 200 of

had<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.020> secret<00:01:22.350> 41<00:01:22.890> blocks<00:01:23.189> on<00:01:23.399> it<00:01:23.579> that<00:01:23.729> you

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:23.789 
had a secret 41 blocks on it that you

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:26.209 
had a secret 41 blocks on it that you
can<00:01:23.909> unlock<00:01:24.090> with<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.539> file<00:01:24.810> that's<00:01:25.740> cool<00:01:25.979> cos

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:26.219 
can unlock with a file that's cool cos

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:28.999 
can unlock with a file that's cool cos
nu<00:01:26.399> 241<00:01:26.969> blocks<00:01:27.149> put<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:27.930> in<00:01:28.049> here<00:01:28.229> doesn't

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
nu 241 blocks put that in here doesn't

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.609 
nu 241 blocks put that in here doesn't
do<00:01:29.070> anything<00:01:29.399> actually<00:01:29.880> just<00:01:30.060> takes<00:01:30.210> up<00:01:30.329> space

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
do anything actually just takes up space

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.340 
do anything actually just takes up space
sucks<00:01:32.180> yeah<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.479> don't<00:01:33.810> know<00:01:33.869> these<00:01:34.170> aren't

that interesting man there's just
nothing<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.090> say<00:01:36.359> you<00:01:36.600> pop<00:01:37.140> them<00:01:37.259> into<00:01:37.439> the

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
nothing to say you pop them into the

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.170 
nothing to say you pop them into the
controller<00:01:37.920> ah<00:01:39.920> then<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.039> says<00:01:41.159> MadCatz<00:01:41.609> you

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
controller ah then it says MadCatz you

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.830 
controller ah then it says MadCatz you
don't<00:01:42.299> want<00:01:42.420> that

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
don't want that

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.469 
don't want that
cuz<00:01:43.259> that<00:01:43.289> never<00:01:43.710> goes<00:01:44.039> away<00:01:44.270> until<00:01:45.270> you<00:01:45.390> do

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
cuz that never goes away until you do
