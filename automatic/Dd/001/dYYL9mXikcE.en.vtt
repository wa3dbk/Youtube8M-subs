almost do it anonymous and maybe it
makes<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.320> easier<00:01:46.680> I<00:01:46.860> feel<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:47.579> it's<00:01:48.090> not

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
makes it easier I feel that it's not

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.969 
makes it easier I feel that it's not
only<00:01:48.630> easier<00:01:48.960> but<00:01:49.229> I<00:01:49.259> feel<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:49.740> when

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
only easier but I feel that when

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.560 
only easier but I feel that when
something<00:01:50.369> happens<00:01:50.700> on<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.149> school<00:01:51.360> setting

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
something happens on the school setting

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.859

everyone takes a picture now it's and I

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.450 
everyone takes a picture now it's and I
think<00:01:55.079> that<00:01:55.229> went<00:01:55.470> wrong<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:55.950> we<00:01:56.130> need<00:01:56.310> to

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
think that went wrong and we need to

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.240 
think that went wrong and we need to
bring<00:01:56.670> back<00:01:57.030> that<00:01:57.509> when<00:01:58.290> we<00:01:58.439> take<00:01:58.619> humiliating

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
that word and I think it's so simple but

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.720 
that word and I think it's so simple but
so<00:02:24.329> hard<00:02:24.780> to<00:02:24.930> do<00:02:25.079> because<00:02:25.709> kids<00:02:26.040> don't<00:02:26.189> really

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
so hard to do because kids don't really

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.670 
so hard to do because kids don't really
realize<00:02:27.120> that<00:02:27.450> I<00:02:27.480> don't<00:02:27.900> think<00:02:28.290> adults

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
realize that I don't think adults

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.709 
realize that I don't think adults
realize<00:02:29.040> we<00:02:29.280> have<00:02:29.459> a<00:02:29.489> choice<00:02:29.760> never<00:02:30.480> choice

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:30.719 
realize we have a choice never choice

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:33.140 
realize we have a choice never choice
every<00:02:31.200> morning<00:02:31.560> to<00:02:31.769> be<00:02:31.859> kind<00:02:32.159> to<00:02:32.370> someone<00:02:32.519> or

every morning to be kind to someone or
not<00:02:33.359> and<00:02:34.200> I<00:02:34.620> think<00:02:34.680> that<00:02:35.310> if<00:02:35.639> we<00:02:35.670> live<00:02:36.060> our

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
not and I think that if we live our

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.099 
not and I think that if we live our
lives<00:02:36.450> with<00:02:36.840> action<00:02:37.290> reaction<00:02:38.030> meaning<00:02:39.109> you
