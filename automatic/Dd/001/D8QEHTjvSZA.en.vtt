00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 guys girls now all I am 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.100
 sitting cords and this is minecraft 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.690
 we are a day of the theory program 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.250
 offers to record a mod and here I bring it from 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.469
 agreement is a rather peculiar way that 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.730
 will give us a little more emotion 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.440
 to minecraft itself that sometimes we 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.199
 bored with so many projects and 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.380
 already so let's start is a forest 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:22.439
 belongs to the 1.7 points of agreement and 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.240
 well what I add is five enemies 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.789
 new enemies 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.349
 3 that are neutral and 2 that are like 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.840
 total enemies that are going to attack you and 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.279
 win by sack of agreement and we are going 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.380
 funny have their own their 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.059
 little things in general we are going to make it 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.550
 make day because I record at night 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.940
 I do not like background because it is normal there 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.950
 very well now translates in general the 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.739
 drop that goes from all these bugs is the 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.670
 next that of a chest is worth and that of 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.110
 fragmented leather and spider eye and eye 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.480
 of spider fragmented things that ever 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.879
 they release no bug worth that spot with 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.699
 you because I have tried a lot is 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.350
 mod and hamas eye of spiders fragments 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.030
 also fragmented that I think so 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.510
 random what has released us but 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.979
 good 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.540
 so I 'm going to follow them a little bit and 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.939
 we're going to kill them so you can see a little 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.060
 how each one works 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.979
 it because not everyone follows the same die 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.380
 turns that for example what comes 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.450
 being the turtle we can mount it worth 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.930
 as you see a lot of on top of her 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.850
 ok and when we kill the turtle it 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.340
 turns into a chest because if a chest 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.079
 empty vale 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.700
 the turtles are different colors 

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:33.079
 As you can see it's worth nothing to kill 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.810
 'coffer bases is a chest there 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:38.780
 because if this is 5g double today it goes there 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.000
 goes security 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.530
 ok but that's always empty 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.880
 inside are different colors what 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.369
 we put the comfortable of the komodo dragon 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.040
 ok you know that this bug comes in the 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.450
 fair play 3 at least and in life 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.940
 real is super aggressive and can you 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.280
 tear off one leg because if it's worth more 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:58.340
 that is a single color so nothing 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:02.060
 and then release leather generally and more 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.470
 sane is worth and more leather and leather and let's go 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.380
 what can you do doing here we go 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.610
 the entire library of agreement 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.009
 then let's give the crocodile that as its 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.090
 name indicates is a crocodile worth the 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.800
 you have here that looked more like 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.950
 alligators that magic crocodiles but 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.200
 good and everyone with his style and 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.640
 they also loose leathers and now suppose 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.940
 same is highly dark look there is 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.530
 agreement they are aggressive and they are going to 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.569
 attack in fact if I put a car that 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.110
 I'm comfortable with this, it's here by itself 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:32.330
 to own therapy and torture is worth 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.580
 if I put a team with fucked 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.140
 is not here in this case but good to 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.400
 It will attack you according to the comfortable 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.910
 it is for everyone how is 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.910
 buzzed 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.800
 ok then we have the says in agreement 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.710
 how good is different colors too 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.480
 it's a roll of chameleon and it's not going 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.880
 to attack vale goes a little more to your roll 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.170
 he lives in his magical pomp and I think that this 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.470
 is the one that gives the most to the spider's eyes 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:58.320
 fragmented oh no no no this nothing else 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.570
 leather is worth nothing, everything is leather, the 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.790
 leather well and then we have choose the 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:05.920
 monster that is this bicharraco here 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.140
 a single color is worth 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.790
 and yes that is going to give us the eye of the year 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.520
 fragmented which is the only one that gives hopefully 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.040
 the already fragmented ok once what 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.989
 we kill you do not always see it own 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.239
 when he wants to with the European order he usually 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.580
 always generate two worth two eyes of 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:24.410
 fragmented spider so good when 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.990
 you killed him out of fixed 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.300
 and it does not attack here very well either and it's already 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.580
 so what is this nickname is a 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.850
 mount that comes without bending the turtle 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:37.250
 giant 22 hostile is worth a hostile and 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.810
 for all animals and then creatures 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.630
 that can add a little bit that touch 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.280
 of more fun almond look how it 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.140
 move what fun is that cool that is 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.120
 well and then that also a bug that 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.010
 when you kill it, make a chest because 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.920
 Yes, what is it good for? 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.760
 save shit 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.760
 great 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:03.020
 and then we make a cube 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:04.670
 and great dad is very good and the 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.830
