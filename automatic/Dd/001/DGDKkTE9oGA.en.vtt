00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.620
 and 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.189
 Y 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.189
 ah 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.780
 today 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:53.180
 so that they go out stunning and facilitated 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:55.460
 facilitated only for you 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.050
 we started let's start first 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:04.250
 let's work with a water pro base 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:07.970
 that we are practicing our English 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.560
 the water suite or maiga we are going to place 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.170
 then these cream shadows 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.090
 worldtour can apply it with both 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.990
 fingers as with a brush is the taste of 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.119
 everyone 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.649
 I apply it with my fingers does not have to 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.680
 be so perfect because the final as 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:26.030
 blur a brush with long bristles 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:28.280
 in my case myself gave me but 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.590
 not so dark because I feel that 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.880
 the face was too much because the guy 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.710
 of camila's look is a little 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.450
 deep then you have to give it more 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.450
 luminosity not darken 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.080
 this is the pigment we are talking about is 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.080
 a very loose powder 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:54.390
 and scandalous 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:58.520
 I think it looks a little camila 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.520
 ah, scandalous pardon 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.140
 this is a gel that can be done both 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.150
 to delineate as to melt the 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.870
 pigment and it does not fall out and it can last 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:09.870
 all night 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.140
 we go back to what are the lines for 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.020
 this we have a shadow in cream too 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.570
 that we mailing from outside to 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.990
 in to earrings from outside towards 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:32.910
 in the eye this is optional 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:35.610
 this is the makeup nominated camila 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.210
 all this you can do with a 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:38.610
 mirror 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.320
 at a 45 degree angle if you have 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.750
 a mirror here and you are watching 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:45.450
 down towards the mirror is facilitated 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.280
 much the part of making the stroke of the 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.530
 line 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.000
 in the market there are some my eyes that are 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.280
 very important because they contain 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.900
 make-up remover in case of committing 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:01.519
 some mistake one does this the liquid drops 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.519
 and you already fall the defiant 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.550
 here we have all this range of colors 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.470
 that normally with all these colors 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.750
 we can do is mobile is important 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.970
 have the range of colors in degradation 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.470
 preferably if you want to do a very 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.690
 strong because you can start from the 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.670
 darker to the lightest of the most 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.769
 clear to the darkest then we're going to 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.599
 work now brightness what 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:25.130
 let's give a touch of light in the 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:25.130
 part of the eyebrows 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.980
 now we go with the most important part 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:36.020
 that is not the blues of heidi 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.180
 in the eyelashes 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:41.030
 the makeup is strong we can work 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.920
 a little bit this type of lashes for 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.930
 highlight a little more the look we can 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.360
 Give more force the way to paste the 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.240
 tab because they always deform the claw 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.160
 complete so lets us the easy 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.740
 with an eyebrow claw the claw for the 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.770
 medium and just as it is for the 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:01.720
 medium is the middle of the two below 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:04.650
 that also with a mirror like that they do 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.650
 very easy 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.090
 only to unite a lot especially with 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.320
 this kind of tab because a one 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:19.799
 tab very strong and large and populated 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.799
 we reinforce the line 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:28.350
 and finally we clean what is the 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:31.020
 part that has been messed up that has 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:34.730
 fallen shadow residue we can use a 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.730
 little bit of the concealer an illuminator 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.290
 easy and hands 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.730
 and here we finish 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:54.370
 and that's how we ended up and that's how we ended up 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:57.760
 makeup a few smoky eyes deep and 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:01.919
 good flashy only for you in this way 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.919
 he sees him walking they learned
