00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.230 
our programming our motor is plugged
into<00:01:55.240> motor<00:01:55.660> port<00:01:56.050> three<00:01:56.700> so<00:01:57.700> we<00:01:57.850> need<00:01:58.090> to

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
into motor port three so we need to

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.440 
into motor port three so we need to
change<00:01:58.630> the<00:01:58.900> value<00:01:58.930> in<00:01:59.380> the<00:01:59.710> motor<00:01:59.950> number

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
change the value in the motor number

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:10.010 
change the value in the motor number
window<00:02:01.450> to<00:02:01.960> three<00:02:02.350> and<00:02:02.590> then<00:02:03.130> we<00:02:03.370> can<00:02:03.550> click<00:02:03.880> OK
