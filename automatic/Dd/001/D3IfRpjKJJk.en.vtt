00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
hello youtube and welcome to your ninth

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.360 
hello youtube and welcome to your ninth
java<00:00:12.330> tutorial<00:00:12.599> I<00:00:13.110> think<00:00:13.920> it<00:00:14.070> might<00:00:14.190> be<00:00:14.280> the

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
java tutorial I think it might be the

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.630 
java tutorial I think it might be the
eight<00:00:14.519> whatever<00:00:15.680> so<00:00:16.680> in<00:00:16.800> this<00:00:16.890> tutorial<00:00:17.070> we're

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
eight whatever so in this tutorial we're

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.340 
eight whatever so in this tutorial we're
going<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:17.850> be<00:00:17.970> creating<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.600> random<00:00:18.900> number

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
going to be creating a random number

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.009 
going to be creating a random number
generator<00:00:20.300> now<00:00:21.300> I<00:00:22.260> was<00:00:22.590> going<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:22.859> do<00:00:23.039> a<00:00:23.250> a

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:24.019 
generator now I was going to do a a

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:25.790 
generator now I was going to do a a
tutorial<00:00:25.019> showing<00:00:25.199> you<00:00:25.439> how<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.560> make<00:00:25.769> a

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
tutorial showing you how to make a

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.920 
tutorial showing you how to make a
window<00:00:26.099> but<00:00:26.849> right<00:00:27.210> now<00:00:27.390> that<00:00:27.630> might<00:00:27.779> be<00:00:27.900> a

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
window but right now that might be a

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.650 
window but right now that might be a
little<00:00:28.109> confusing<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.740> you<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.189> I<00:00:30.090> decided<00:00:30.570> to

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
little confusing to you and I decided to

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.120 
little confusing to you and I decided to
make<00:00:30.779> this<00:00:30.929> tutorial<00:00:31.410> because<00:00:31.500> it<00:00:31.740> has<00:00:31.859> little

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
make this tutorial because it has little

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.010 
make this tutorial because it has little
bits<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.550> pieces<00:00:32.610> in<00:00:33.059> it<00:00:33.180> that<00:00:33.630> will<00:00:33.750> help<00:00:33.870> you

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
bits and pieces in it that will help you

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.630 
bits and pieces in it that will help you
better<00:00:34.230> understand<00:00:34.860> creating<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.340> window

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
better understand creating a window

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.970 
better understand creating a window
later<00:00:35.850> on<00:00:36.059> when<00:00:36.210> we<00:00:36.239> actually<00:00:36.480> get<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.260> so

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
later on when we actually get to it so

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.030 
later on when we actually get to it so

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
we got onto the SRC new class and we'll

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.670 
we got onto the SRC new class and we'll
just<00:01:08.520> name<00:01:08.729> it

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
just name it

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.510 
just name it
random<00:01:10.680> gin<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:12.119> we'll<00:01:13.110> go<00:01:13.229> ahead<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.710> let<00:01:14.490> it

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
random gin and we'll go ahead and let it

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.240 
random gin and we'll go ahead and let it
create<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.240> public<00:01:15.479> static<00:01:15.930> void<00:01:15.960> main<00:01:16.530> class

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
create the public static void main class

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.670 
create the public static void main class
the<00:01:17.549> main<00:01:17.729> class<00:01:18.170> since<00:01:19.170> we've<00:01:19.320> already<00:01:19.439> done

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
the main class since we've already done

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.870 
the main class since we've already done
that<00:01:19.710> so<00:01:19.860> much<00:01:20.159> you<00:01:20.220> can<00:01:20.340> go<00:01:20.430> ahead<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.700> start

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
that so much you can go ahead and start

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.359 
that so much you can go ahead and start
doing<00:01:21.150> this<00:01:21.240> if<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:21.600> want<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:22.130> go<00:01:23.130> ahead<00:01:23.250> and

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
click finish and you can see it's

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.859 
click finish and you can see it's
already<00:01:26.400> made<00:01:26.580> our<00:01:26.880> main<00:01:27.119> method<00:01:27.360> for<00:01:27.720> us

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
already made our main method for us

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.260 
already made our main method for us
let's<00:01:28.829> go<00:01:28.920> ahead<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.189> just<00:01:29.340> get<00:01:29.850> rid<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.150> all

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
let's go ahead and just get rid of all

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.190 
let's go ahead and just get rid of all
these<00:01:30.570> useless<00:01:31.020> comments<00:01:31.850> and<00:01:33.110> let's<00:01:34.110> go

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
these useless comments and let's go

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.149 
these useless comments and let's go
ahead<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.439> get<00:01:34.530> started<00:01:35.900> so<00:01:36.900> um<00:01:37.140> here<00:01:37.920> we<00:01:37.950> have

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
ahead and get started so um here we have

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.130 
ahead and get started so um here we have
our<00:01:38.280> main<00:01:38.430> method<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:39.000> what<00:01:39.600> we<00:01:39.689> need<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:39.960> do

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
our main method and what we need to do

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.889 
our main method and what we need to do
is<00:01:40.409> we<00:01:40.740> need<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:41.009> import<00:01:41.490> something<00:01:42.030> now

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
is we need to import something now

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.870 
is we need to import something now
basically<00:01:43.110> what<00:01:43.439> that<00:01:43.590> does<00:01:43.829> is<00:01:44.159> there<00:01:44.759> are

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
basically what that does is there are

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.030 
basically what that does is there are
some<00:01:45.090> things<00:01:45.329> like<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.780> math<00:01:46.020> class<00:01:46.500> that

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
some things like the math class that

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.530 
some things like the math class that
I've<00:01:47.189> talked<00:01:47.460> about<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.850> let<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.180> previous

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
I've talked about and let the previous

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.880 
I've talked about and let the previous
tutorials<00:01:48.960> that<00:01:49.530> come<00:01:49.829> already<00:01:50.640> built<00:01:50.970> in<00:01:51.890> to

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
tutorials that come already built in to

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.460 
tutorials that come already built in to
Java<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.610> in<00:01:54.360> your<00:01:54.540> program<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.259> don't

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
Java and in your program and you don't

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.469 
Java and in your program and you don't
have<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.710> import<00:01:56.130> any<00:01:56.399> of<00:01:56.490> Java's<00:01:56.850> classes<00:01:57.360> to

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
have to import any of Java's classes to

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.389 
have to import any of Java's classes to
use<00:01:57.659> them<00:01:57.810> they're<00:01:57.960> just<00:01:57.990> already<00:01:58.500> there<00:01:58.680> now

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
use them they're just already there now

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.550 
use them they're just already there now
with<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.030> bunch<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.450> Java<00:02:00.630> classes<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:01.469> you're

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
with a bunch of Java classes that you're

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.270 
with a bunch of Java classes that you're
going<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.740> be<00:02:01.890> using<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.430> packages<00:02:04.280> you're

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
going to be using and packages you're

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.819 
going to be using and packages you're
going<00:02:05.430> to<00:02:05.490> need<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.759> be<00:02:05.880> importing<00:02:06.630> them<00:02:06.840> so

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
going to need to be importing them so

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.529 
going to need to be importing them so
basically<00:02:07.950> what<00:02:08.369> this<00:02:08.459> does<00:02:08.520> is<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.119> searches

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
basically what this does is it searches

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.680 
basically what this does is it searches
through<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.929> library<00:02:10.319> grabs<00:02:11.099> those<00:02:11.690> packages

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
through the library grabs those packages

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.940 
through the library grabs those packages
classes

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
classes

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.440 
classes
and<00:02:14.450> methods<00:02:15.890> it<00:02:16.890> pulls<00:02:17.220> them<00:02:17.370> out<00:02:17.520> and<00:02:17.700> sets

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
and methods it pulls them out and sets

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.600

them<00:02:18.629> out<00:02:18.780> ready<00:02:19.019> for<00:02:19.230> you<00:02:19.379> to<00:02:19.500> use<00:02:19.769> so<00:02:20.489> we'll

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
them out ready for you to use so we'll

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.500 
them out ready for you to use so we'll
go<00:02:20.730> ahead<00:02:20.760> and<00:02:20.989> import<00:02:22.099> Java<00:02:23.099> which<00:02:23.550> is<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:23.910> I

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
go ahead and import Java which is the I

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.830 
go ahead and import Java which is the I
think<00:02:24.900> is<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.319> I<00:02:25.879> think<00:02:26.879> it's<00:02:26.970> a<00:02:27.060> package<00:02:27.569> I

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
think is the I think it's a package I

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.900 
think is the I think it's a package I
don't<00:02:28.260> know<00:02:28.319> I<00:02:28.349> get<00:02:28.500> this<00:02:28.620> confused<00:02:28.920> a<00:02:29.069> lot<00:02:29.220> but

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
don't know I get this confused a lot but

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.650 
don't know I get this confused a lot but

Java dot util for utility dot random
with<00:02:34.230> a<00:02:34.260> capital<00:02:34.709> R<00:02:36.200> so<00:02:37.200> now<00:02:37.230> that<00:02:37.410> we've

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
with a capital R so now that we've

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.640 
with a capital R so now that we've
imported<00:02:38.099> the<00:02:39.019> random<00:02:40.019> class<00:02:40.860> I<00:02:42.440> think<00:02:43.440> it's<00:02:43.590> a

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
imported the random class I think it's a

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.130 
imported the random class I think it's a
class<00:02:43.860> I'm<00:02:44.069> not<00:02:44.099> sure<00:02:44.400> but<00:02:45.390> I'll<00:02:45.599> go<00:02:45.930> ahead<00:02:45.989> and

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
class I'm not sure but I'll go ahead and

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.660 
class I'm not sure but I'll go ahead and
look<00:02:46.230> that<00:02:46.380> up<00:02:46.560> if<00:02:46.769> you<00:02:46.860> want<00:02:47.040> to<00:02:47.340> if<00:02:47.549> you're

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
look that up if you want to if you're

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.190 
look that up if you want to if you're
real<00:02:47.819> curious<00:02:48.209> and<00:02:48.330> you<00:02:48.420> want<00:02:48.540> to<00:02:48.599> know<00:02:48.660> it<00:02:48.780> but

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
real curious and you want to know it but

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.289 
real curious and you want to know it but
now<00:02:49.290> that<00:02:49.470> we've<00:02:49.590> imported<00:02:50.040> random<00:02:50.640> we're

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
now that we've imported random we're

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.559 
now that we've imported random we're
going<00:02:51.450> to<00:02:51.510> go<00:02:51.630> ahead<00:02:51.780> and<00:02:52.519> create<00:02:53.519> our<00:02:53.760> random

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
going to go ahead and create our random

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.990 
going to go ahead and create our random
object<00:02:55.170> so<00:02:55.829> basically<00:02:56.190> what<00:02:56.400> you<00:02:56.579> want<00:02:56.790> to<00:02:56.819> do

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
object so basically what you want to do

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.610 
object so basically what you want to do
is<00:02:57.269> in<00:02:57.630> Java

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
is in Java

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.860 
is in Java
whenever<00:02:59.400> you<00:02:59.549> import<00:03:00.060> something<00:03:00.299> if<00:03:00.599> you

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
whenever you import something if you

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.780 
whenever you import something if you
want<00:03:01.079> to<00:03:01.170> use<00:03:01.319> a<00:03:01.349> method<00:03:01.680> that's<00:03:01.980> in<00:03:02.130> there<00:03:02.310> you

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
want to use a method that's in there you

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.670 
want to use a method that's in there you
got<00:03:02.940> to<00:03:03.060> create<00:03:03.239> an<00:03:03.450> object<00:03:03.630> from<00:03:04.349> it<00:03:04.500> so<00:03:04.650> you

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
got to create an object from it so you

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.370 
got to create an object from it so you
can<00:03:05.010> use<00:03:05.310> that<00:03:05.880> object<00:03:06.329> basically<00:03:07.019> what<00:03:07.290> the

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
can use that object basically what the

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.400 
can use that object basically what the
object<00:03:07.799> is<00:03:07.890> is<00:03:08.190> it's<00:03:08.790> similar<00:03:09.599> to<00:03:09.870> a<00:03:09.900> variable

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
object is is it's similar to a variable

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.640 
object is is it's similar to a variable
type<00:03:10.739> and<00:03:11.329> whenever<00:03:12.329> it's<00:03:12.900> call<00:03:13.290> whenever

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
type and whenever it's call whenever

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.589 
type and whenever it's call whenever
that<00:03:13.769> object<00:03:14.370> is<00:03:14.519> used<00:03:14.790> then<00:03:15.030> it<00:03:15.060> calls<00:03:15.360> that

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
that object is used then it calls that

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.289 
that object is used then it calls that
method<00:03:16.019> so<00:03:16.950> to<00:03:17.549> go<00:03:17.670> ahead<00:03:17.849> and<00:03:17.940> create<00:03:18.090> your

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
method so to go ahead and create your

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.800 
method so to go ahead and create your
random<00:03:18.720> object<00:03:19.519> we're<00:03:20.519> going<00:03:20.670> to<00:03:20.730> type<00:03:21.000> random

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
random object we're going to type random

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.160 
random object we're going to type random
and<00:03:23.180> then<00:03:24.180> whatever<00:03:24.420> you<00:03:24.630> want<00:03:24.810> I'll<00:03:24.930> just<00:03:24.959> a

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
and then whatever you want I'll just a

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:31.129 
and then whatever you want I'll just a
mind<00:03:25.410> Sam<00:03:26.000> equals<00:03:27.000> new<00:03:27.590> random<00:03:29.780> so<00:03:30.780> basically

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
mind Sam equals new random so basically

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:32.750 
mind Sam equals new random so basically
what<00:03:31.380> we've<00:03:31.530> done<00:03:31.560> is<00:03:31.920> we've<00:03:32.100> created<00:03:32.280> a<00:03:32.730> new

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
what we've done is we've created a new

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.000 
what we've done is we've created a new
random<00:03:33.420> object<00:03:34.319> and<00:03:34.560> the<00:03:35.310> name<00:03:35.489> of<00:03:35.519> it<00:03:35.940> is<00:03:36.180> Sam

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
random object and the name of it is Sam

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.440 
random object and the name of it is Sam
so<00:03:38.010> whenever<00:03:38.220> we<00:03:38.430> want<00:03:38.579> to<00:03:38.639> use<00:03:38.819> the<00:03:39.000> random

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
so whenever we want to use the random

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.039 
so whenever we want to use the random
method<00:03:40.790> we<00:03:41.790> just<00:03:42.000> call<00:03:42.239> Sam<00:03:42.600> and<00:03:42.630> if<00:03:42.930> you

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
method we just call Sam and if you

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.080 
method we just call Sam and if you
create<00:03:43.350> more<00:03:43.620> than<00:03:44.160> one<00:03:44.310> random<00:03:44.489> object

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
create more than one random object

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.879 
create more than one random object
whenever<00:03:45.870> you<00:03:46.019> use<00:03:46.230> that<00:03:46.380> random<00:03:46.680> method

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889 
whenever you use that random method

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:48.460 
whenever you use that random method
let's<00:03:47.040> say<00:03:47.160> we<00:03:47.310> make<00:03:47.519> another<00:03:47.790> one<00:03:47.880> called

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
let's say we make another one called

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.289 
let's say we make another one called
random<00:03:49.470> John<00:03:49.709> equals<00:03:50.040> new<00:03:50.160> random<00:03:50.400> we<00:03:51.120> can

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
random John equals new random we can

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:52.970 
random John equals new random we can
call<00:03:51.510> those<00:03:51.720> two<00:03:51.870> separately<00:03:52.380> and<00:03:52.620> they'll<00:03:52.799> be

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
call those two separately and they'll be

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.580 
call those two separately and they'll be
different<00:03:53.810> so<00:03:54.810> you're<00:03:54.959> not<00:03:55.079> just<00:03:55.380> using

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
different so you're not just using

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.280 
different so you're not just using
random<00:03:56.130> over<00:03:56.370> and<00:03:56.519> over<00:03:56.670> again<00:03:56.760> you<00:03:57.750> can<00:03:57.930> see

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
random over and over again you can see

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.629 
random over and over again you can see
what<00:03:58.470> you're<00:03:58.650> using<00:03:58.799> it<00:03:59.040> for<00:03:59.069> and<00:03:59.370> it'll<00:03:59.519> have

00:03:59.629 --> 00:03:59.639 
what you're using it for and it'll have

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:02.509 
what you're using it for and it'll have
different<00:04:00.030> names<00:04:01.130> so<00:04:02.130> now<00:04:02.250> that<00:04:02.310> we've

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
different names so now that we've

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.640 
different names so now that we've
created<00:04:02.700> that<00:04:03.090> object<00:04:03.780> we're<00:04:04.349> going<00:04:04.500> to<00:04:04.560> go

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
created that object we're going to go

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.120 
created that object we're going to go
ahead<00:04:04.769> and<00:04:05.130> print<00:04:05.760> it<00:04:05.970> out<00:04:06.180> on<00:04:06.329> the<00:04:06.480> screen<00:04:07.130> so

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
ahead and print it out on the screen so

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.659 
ahead and print it out on the screen so
we're<00:04:08.220> going<00:04:08.310> to<00:04:08.370> do<00:04:08.489> system<00:04:08.970> dot<00:04:09.690> out<00:04:09.720> dot

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:10.669 
we're going to do system dot out dot

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:12.930 
we're going to do system dot out dot
print<00:04:11.669> line

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
print line

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:20.090 
print line
and<00:04:13.920> we're<00:04:14.920> going<00:04:15.040> to<00:04:15.100> go<00:04:15.220> ahead<00:04:15.370> and<00:04:17.760> Sam<00:04:19.080> dot

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
and we're going to go ahead and Sam dot

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.600 
and we're going to go ahead and Sam dot
next<00:04:21.150> int<00:04:22.410> so<00:04:23.410> basically<00:04:23.770> what<00:04:23.980> next<00:04:24.250> int<00:04:24.430> does

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
next int so basically what next int does

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:25.830 
next int so basically what next int does
is<00:04:24.880> um

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
is um

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.320 
is um
returns<00:04:26.320> the<00:04:26.500> next<00:04:26.770> pseudo<00:04:27.370> pseudo-random

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
returns the next pseudo pseudo-random

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.790 
returns the next pseudo pseudo-random
basically<00:04:31.330> what<00:04:31.780> that<00:04:31.930> means<00:04:32.170> is<00:04:32.470> it's<00:04:32.740> going

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
basically what that means is it's going

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.590 
basically what that means is it's going
to<00:04:32.920> go<00:04:33.070> on<00:04:33.220> to<00:04:33.370> the<00:04:33.460> next<00:04:33.610> random<00:04:33.970> number<00:04:34.180> that

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
to go on to the next random number that

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.290 
to go on to the next random number that
this<00:04:34.990> method<00:04:35.410> has<00:04:35.560> created<00:04:36.130> and<00:04:36.310> now<00:04:36.910> inside

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
this method has created and now inside

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:40.140 
this method has created and now inside
of<00:04:37.510> your<00:04:38.040> parameters<00:04:39.040> which<00:04:39.550> we<00:04:39.700> talked<00:04:39.910> about

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
of your parameters which we talked about

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.730 
of your parameters which we talked about
in<00:04:40.240> previous<00:04:40.390> tutorials<00:04:41.110> you<00:04:41.680> want<00:04:41.890> to<00:04:41.980> type

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
in previous tutorials you want to type

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.230 
in previous tutorials you want to type
the<00:04:44.740> number<00:04:45.160> the<00:04:45.430> amount<00:04:45.550> of<00:04:45.820> numbers<00:04:46.090> that

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
the number the amount of numbers that

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.750 
the number the amount of numbers that
can<00:04:46.390> go<00:04:46.480> to<00:04:46.570> so<00:04:46.870> if<00:04:46.990> you<00:04:47.020> type<00:04:47.260> 50<00:04:47.770> it's<00:04:48.520> going

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
can go to so if you type 50 it's going

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:57.840 
can go to so if you type 50 it's going
to<00:04:48.820> be<00:04:50.370> 0<00:04:51.930> through<00:04:54.750> 50<00:04:55.750> which<00:04:56.140> will<00:04:56.400> be<00:04:57.400> 51

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
to be 0 through 50 which will be 51

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.970 
to be 0 through 50 which will be 51
numbers<00:04:58.360> and<00:04:58.600> if<00:04:59.110> you<00:04:59.200> just<00:04:59.350> want<00:04:59.560> 50<00:04:59.830> numbers

00:04:59.970 --> 00:04:59.980 
numbers and if you just want 50 numbers

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.260 
numbers and if you just want 50 numbers
and<00:05:00.280> I'll<00:05:00.340> show<00:05:00.490> you<00:05:00.580> how<00:05:00.670> to<00:05:00.700> correct<00:05:01.030> that<00:05:01.150> in

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
and I'll show you how to correct that in

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:06.830 
and I'll show you how to correct that in
a<00:05:01.330> second<00:05:01.660> so<00:05:01.840> if<00:05:02.440> we<00:05:02.530> type<00:05:02.680> 50<00:05:03.160> right<00:05:03.370> here<00:05:04.950> and

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
a second so if we type 50 right here and

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.690 
a second so if we type 50 right here and
if<00:05:07.840> we<00:05:07.990> go<00:05:08.140> ahead<00:05:08.170> and<00:05:08.440> do<00:05:08.920> this<00:05:09.070> a<00:05:09.310> bunch<00:05:09.550> of

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 
if we go ahead and do this a bunch of

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.760 
if we go ahead and do this a bunch of
times<00:05:09.790> now<00:05:10.780> I<00:05:10.840> could<00:05:11.230> show<00:05:11.380> you<00:05:11.410> how<00:05:11.530> to<00:05:11.680> do

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
times now I could show you how to do

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.020 
times now I could show you how to do
this<00:05:11.890> with<00:05:12.070> a<00:05:12.100> loop<00:05:12.340> but<00:05:12.490> we<00:05:12.610> haven't<00:05:12.760> gotten

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
this with a loop but we haven't gotten

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.120 
this with a loop but we haven't gotten
to<00:05:13.240> the<00:05:13.360> loops<00:05:13.570> yet<00:05:13.810> and<00:05:14.680> I<00:05:14.740> don't<00:05:14.770> want<00:05:15.040> to

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
to the loops yet and I don't want to

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:16.290 
to the loops yet and I don't want to
confuse<00:05:15.400> any<00:05:15.670> more<00:05:15.880> than<00:05:16.060> you<00:05:16.150> probably

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
confuse any more than you probably

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.970 
confuse any more than you probably
already<00:05:16.660> are

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:17.980 
already are

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.280 
already are
I'll<00:05:18.460> just<00:05:18.670> go<00:05:18.790> ahead<00:05:18.910> and<00:05:19.330> do<00:05:19.660> this<00:05:19.870> a<00:05:20.200> couple

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:20.290 
I'll just go ahead and do this a couple

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:27.600 
I'll just go ahead and do this a couple
of<00:05:20.980> times<00:05:24.690> okay<00:05:25.710> so<00:05:26.710> now<00:05:27.130> we're<00:05:27.310> just<00:05:27.370> going<00:05:27.550> to

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
of times okay so now we're just going to

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.630 
of times okay so now we're just going to
do<00:05:27.790> is<00:05:28.030> it's<00:05:28.270> going<00:05:28.360> to<00:05:28.510> print<00:05:29.080> line<00:05:29.640> Sam

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:30.640 
do is it's going to print line Sam

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:31.560 
do is it's going to print line Sam

between<00:05:31.990> 0<00:05:32.290> and<00:05:32.560> 50<00:05:32.980> and<00:05:33.100> it's<00:05:33.190> going<00:05:33.340> to<00:05:33.400> do

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 
between 0 and 50 and it's going to do

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.670 
between 0 and 50 and it's going to do
that<00:05:33.669> 5<00:05:33.970> times<00:05:34.270> so<00:05:35.020> if<00:05:35.080> we<00:05:35.169> go<00:05:35.260> ahead<00:05:35.350> and<00:05:35.470> run

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
that 5 times so if we go ahead and run

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:41.340 
that 5 times so if we go ahead and run
this<00:05:36.360> we<00:05:37.360> go<00:05:37.480> to<00:05:37.510> the<00:05:37.660> console<00:05:38.320> it's<00:05:39.570> 1939<00:05:40.570> 19-0

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:41.350 
this we go to the console it's 1939 19-0

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:45.560 
this we go to the console it's 1939 19-0
+<00:05:41.590> 43<00:05:41.950> so<00:05:42.610> you<00:05:42.700> can<00:05:42.820> see<00:05:42.970> there<00:05:43.419> that<00:05:43.450> we<00:05:43.840> got

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:45.570 
+ 43 so you can see there that we got

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:48.210 
+ 43 so you can see there that we got
five<00:05:46.570> random<00:05:47.230> numbers<00:05:47.590> and<00:05:47.740> you<00:05:47.890> can<00:05:47.980> see<00:05:48.070> one

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:48.220 
five random numbers and you can see one

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.980 
five random numbers and you can see one
of<00:05:48.250> them<00:05:48.430> is<00:05:48.550> zero<00:05:48.820> now<00:05:49.330> if<00:05:49.450> you<00:05:49.570> don't<00:05:49.750> want

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:49.990 
of them is zero now if you don't want

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:53.250 
of them is zero now if you don't want
that<00:05:50.080> to<00:05:50.260> happen<00:05:50.730> and<00:05:51.750> you<00:05:52.750> want<00:05:52.930> it<00:05:52.990> to<00:05:53.020> guess

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:53.260 
that to happen and you want it to guess

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:56.790 
that to happen and you want it to guess
a<00:05:53.290> random<00:05:53.770> number<00:05:53.890> from<00:05:54.820> 1<00:05:55.150> to<00:05:55.510> 50<00:05:55.930> so<00:05:56.590> it<00:05:56.680> can

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 
a random number from 1 to 50 so it can

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:59.010 
a random number from 1 to 50 so it can
be<00:05:56.919> 50<00:05:57.310> or<00:05:57.460> 1<00:05:57.850> or<00:05:57.880> anything<00:05:58.360> in<00:05:58.630> between

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
be 50 or 1 or anything in between

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.510 
be 50 or 1 or anything in between
then<00:05:59.680> there's<00:06:00.190> a<00:06:00.430> simple<00:06:00.850> fix<00:06:01.030> for<00:06:01.120> that<00:06:01.360> and

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 
then there's a simple fix for that and

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:04.680 
then there's a simple fix for that and
this<00:06:03.520> is<00:06:03.700> one<00:06:03.850> thing<00:06:04.000> you<00:06:04.090> have<00:06:04.210> to<00:06:04.270> remember<00:06:04.510> a

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:04.690 
this is one thing you have to remember a

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:08.670 
this is one thing you have to remember a
lot<00:06:04.750> in<00:06:05.110> Java<00:06:05.350> is<00:06:05.620> that<00:06:06.780> whenever<00:06:07.780> you're

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680 
lot in Java is that whenever you're

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.400 
lot in Java is that whenever you're
counting<00:06:09.550> or<00:06:09.700> doing<00:06:09.910> anything<00:06:10.150> in<00:06:10.360> Java<00:06:10.600> the

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:11.410 
counting or doing anything in Java the

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:14.040 
counting or doing anything in Java the
computer<00:06:11.890> starts<00:06:12.160> with<00:06:12.490> the<00:06:12.850> number<00:06:13.150> 0<00:06:13.480> unlike

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:14.050 
computer starts with the number 0 unlike

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:16.050 
computer starts with the number 0 unlike
people<00:06:14.350> so<00:06:15.160> you<00:06:15.220> always<00:06:15.640> have<00:06:15.790> to<00:06:15.880> keep<00:06:16.000> that

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.060 
people so you always have to keep that

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:20.460 
people so you always have to keep that
in<00:06:16.300> mind<00:06:17.070> so<00:06:18.070> if<00:06:18.400> you<00:06:19.030> do<00:06:19.150> 49<00:06:19.720> it's<00:06:20.080> going<00:06:20.320> to<00:06:20.380> be

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:20.470 
in mind so if you do 49 it's going to be

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:23.310 
in mind so if you do 49 it's going to be
0<00:06:20.800> -<00:06:20.890> 4<00:06:21.010> -<00:06:21.160> 9<00:06:21.220> but<00:06:21.880> you<00:06:21.970> don't<00:06:22.150> want<00:06:22.330> that<00:06:22.510> so<00:06:23.080> if

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:23.320 
0 - 4 - 9 but you don't want that so if

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.610 
0 - 4 - 9 but you don't want that so if
you<00:06:23.470> just<00:06:23.620> add<00:06:23.830> 1<00:06:24.270> it'll<00:06:25.270> add<00:06:26.169> 1

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:26.620 
you just add 1 it'll add 1

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.040 
you just add 1 it'll add 1
to<00:06:26.740> that<00:06:26.889> so<00:06:27.190> if<00:06:27.520> the<00:06:28.180> computer<00:06:28.570> randomly

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.050 
to that so if the computer randomly

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.320 
to that so if the computer randomly
generates<00:06:29.500> the<00:06:29.680> number<00:06:29.919> 49<00:06:30.460> then<00:06:30.910> it<00:06:31.090> will<00:06:31.210> be

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:31.330 
generates the number 49 then it will be

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:33.600 
generates the number 49 then it will be
50<00:06:31.840> and<00:06:32.050> if<00:06:32.530> it<00:06:32.650> randomly<00:06:33.010> generates<00:06:33.460> the

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:33.610 
50 and if it randomly generates the

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:35.490 
50 and if it randomly generates the
number<00:06:33.850> zero<00:06:34.120> then<00:06:34.330> it<00:06:34.449> will<00:06:34.540> be<00:06:34.630> 1<00:06:34.870> so<00:06:35.380> this

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:35.500 
number zero then it will be 1 so this

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.080 
number zero then it will be 1 so this
mixes<00:06:35.889> your<00:06:36.010> problem<00:06:36.370> and<00:06:36.520> you<00:06:36.639> get<00:06:36.790> a<00:06:36.820> random

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:37.090 
mixes your problem and you get a random

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:37.710 
mixes your problem and you get a random
number

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:37.720 
number

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.430 
number
that's<00:06:38.080> 150<00:06:38.680> or<00:06:39.040> anything<00:06:39.250> in<00:06:39.490> between<00:06:39.870> so<00:06:40.870> if

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:41.440 
that's 150 or anything in between so if

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:47.340 
that's 150 or anything in between so if
we<00:06:41.590> go<00:06:41.740> ahead<00:06:41.860> and<00:06:44.280> copy<00:06:45.280> that<00:06:46.110> we<00:06:47.110> want<00:06:47.320> to

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:47.350 
we go ahead and copy that we want to

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:53.159 
we go ahead and copy that we want to
delete<00:06:47.620> all<00:06:47.680> this<00:06:47.949> out<00:06:51.750> I'll<00:06:52.750> just<00:06:52.900> do<00:06:53.020> it<00:06:53.050> a

00:06:53.159 --> 00:06:53.169 
delete all this out I'll just do it a

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:54.570 
delete all this out I'll just do it a
bunch<00:06:53.290> of<00:06:53.470> times<00:06:53.680> so<00:06:53.800> hopefully<00:06:54.010> we'll<00:06:54.430> get

00:06:54.570 --> 00:06:54.580 
bunch of times so hopefully we'll get

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:59.700 
bunch of times so hopefully we'll get
one<00:06:55.030> or<00:06:55.240> or<00:06:55.510> a<00:06:55.540> 50<00:06:58.080> we<00:06:59.080> didn't<00:06:59.320> get<00:06:59.410> it<00:06:59.530> there

00:06:59.700 --> 00:06:59.710 
one or or a 50 we didn't get it there

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:01.770 
one or or a 50 we didn't get it there
let's<00:07:00.130> run<00:07:00.310> it<00:07:00.400> again<00:07:00.460> alright<00:07:01.389> so<00:07:01.570> there<00:07:01.750> we

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:01.780 
let's run it again alright so there we

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:05.100 
let's run it again alright so there we
got<00:07:02.050> a<00:07:02.080> 1<00:07:02.820> which<00:07:03.820> the<00:07:03.970> computer<00:07:04.330> sees<00:07:04.510> at<00:07:04.720> zero

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:05.110 
got a 1 which the computer sees at zero

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:07.260 
got a 1 which the computer sees at zero
and<00:07:05.350> it<00:07:05.410> adds<00:07:05.560> one<00:07:05.889> to<00:07:05.919> it<00:07:06.100> see<00:07:06.820> if<00:07:06.880> we<00:07:07.000> can<00:07:07.150> get

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:07.270 
and it adds one to it see if we can get

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:19.800 
and it adds one to it see if we can get
a<00:07:07.300> 50<00:07:07.840> here<00:07:08.289> ah<00:07:17.880> it<00:07:18.880> doesn't<00:07:19.120> want<00:07:19.360> to<00:07:19.449> generate

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:19.810 
a 50 here ah it doesn't want to generate

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:25.800 
a 50 here ah it doesn't want to generate
50<00:07:23.639> I'm<00:07:24.639> gonna<00:07:24.760> try<00:07:24.850> one<00:07:24.970> more<00:07:25.060> time<00:07:25.270> see<00:07:25.630> if<00:07:25.720> it

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:25.810 
50 I'm gonna try one more time see if it

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:29.790 
50 I'm gonna try one more time see if it
works<00:07:26.020> and<00:07:26.520> no<00:07:27.520> it<00:07:27.639> doesn't<00:07:27.820> so<00:07:28.449> I'm<00:07:28.800> hopefully

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:29.800 
works and no it doesn't so I'm hopefully

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.460 
works and no it doesn't so I'm hopefully
you<00:07:29.919> guys<00:07:30.039> believe<00:07:30.430> me<00:07:30.460> but<00:07:30.849> um<00:07:31.320> when<00:07:32.320> you're

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:32.470 
you guys believe me but um when you're

00:07:32.470 --> 00:07:35.640 
you guys believe me but um when you're
doing<00:07:32.680> it<00:07:32.800> like<00:07:32.919> this<00:07:33.220> it'll<00:07:33.910> generate<00:07:34.530> 150<00:07:35.530> or

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:35.650 
doing it like this it'll generate 150 or

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:37.350 
doing it like this it'll generate 150 or
anywhere<00:07:35.919> in<00:07:35.950> between<00:07:36.039> so<00:07:36.820> go<00:07:36.940> ahead<00:07:37.060> and<00:07:37.180> look

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:37.360 
anywhere in between so go ahead and look

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.210 
anywhere in between so go ahead and look
at<00:07:37.419> this<00:07:37.570> code<00:07:37.810> play<00:07:38.560> around<00:07:38.770> with<00:07:38.919> it<00:07:39.070> get

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:39.220 
at this code play around with it get

00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:40.860 
at this code play around with it get
familiar<00:07:39.610> with<00:07:39.729> objects<00:07:40.360> that's<00:07:40.539> something

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:40.870 
familiar with objects that's something

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:42.750 
familiar with objects that's something
that<00:07:40.990> you're<00:07:41.080> going<00:07:41.200> to<00:07:41.229> be<00:07:41.349> using<00:07:41.740> in<00:07:41.919> almost

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:42.760 
that you're going to be using in almost

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.820 
that you're going to be using in almost
every<00:07:43.330> single<00:07:43.570> program<00:07:44.110> you<00:07:44.260> make<00:07:44.470> and<00:07:44.740> you

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:44.830 
every single program you make and you

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:47.040 
every single program you make and you
have<00:07:45.039> to<00:07:45.280> be<00:07:45.460> familiar<00:07:46.090> with<00:07:46.389> objects<00:07:46.900> and

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:47.050 
have to be familiar with objects and

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:49.710 
have to be familiar with objects and
able<00:07:47.229> to<00:07:47.260> use<00:07:47.530> them<00:07:47.830> and<00:07:48.190> feel<00:07:49.150> confident<00:07:49.570> with

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:49.720 
able to use them and feel confident with

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.719 
able to use them and feel confident with
them<00:07:49.900> so<00:07:50.530> go<00:07:50.650> ahead<00:07:50.770> and<00:07:50.889> practice<00:07:51.099> this<00:07:51.430> bunch

00:07:51.719 --> 00:07:51.729 
them so go ahead and practice this bunch
