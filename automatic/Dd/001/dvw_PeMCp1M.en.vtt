00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:12.950
 Hi girls 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:18.060
 Today I'm going to teach tape bias 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:20.699
 with the bias machine foot on the 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.430
 last video and I showed this one that 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:26.400
 it was a manual way with no foot 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:30.230
 machine and today I'm going to show 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:34.200
 put it with the device that is this one 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:39.600
 This little gadget is to put the tape. 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:42.649
 easiest way bias is more 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:47.129
 simple because you only sew 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:49.710
 this little gadget understands is nassim g 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.570
 my machine is a facilitator 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:59.870
 I bought the simple one he went 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:59.870
 liked about 70 80 pesos 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.549
 it's how it works you place 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:12.180
 ribbon 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:14.760
 here 's how it 's right on the tape and fold 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:19.310
 It's a two-centimeter tape. 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.310
 golden stay one centimeter places here 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:29.400
 and he has to go under the 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.310
 PKU is here to this screw 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.040
 adjusting the size of your bias tape is 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.320
 two centimeters 1 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.770
 and at this point you can open 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.380
 bolt but it will open quite a bit. 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.750
 for tape access is larger or close 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.340
 plus your tape is shorter is 1 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.369
 centimeter that will stay half 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.220
 centimeter when folded screw to 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.350
 adjusting or this appliance is regular 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.079
 you can put the tape of the 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:04.619
 size that provides handsets and this 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:08.489
 another for rifle ak also you move away and 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:11.340
 comes close to the needle bias tape 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.700
 because here you will pass the needle to 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.690
 do the sewing 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:19.989
 if you get this close enough as well 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.120
 against the locking bolt 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.010
 the culture will come out here in the middle of the bias 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.110
 Because needles are here in the middle will 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.450
 here in the middle and is not what 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.150
 we want to seam straight but 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:34.660
 here at the tip unless you 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:37.480
 want to sew an embroidery 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.269
 to do this right in the middle of the 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.150
 video but if you want to do the sewing 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:46.510
 normal straight line goes further towards the 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:50.140
 needle pass here on the edge but 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.769
 that we finished adjusting there in the 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:57.549
 I'm not going to teach the machine how to put it anymore. 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:03:00.010
 he here in your machine you take that 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:02.500
 screw that already has the machine to 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.930
 take off the traditional retreat 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.319
 screw me in the same that I can not 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:13.090
 take it by the hand I think it has to 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:16.150
 with a screwdriver and make it the 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:19.239
 screw and take the case 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:26.620
 the old one misses another example and then you 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:28.889
 places close to the faithful and places the 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.889
 screw 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:46.070
 the line goes here so low 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:46.070
 so much that the low that sees everything 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:59.250
 adjust where to see needle 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:07.020
 Here O needle're almost where I want I 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:13.050
 I can adjust more to like myself 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:14.100
 I want here I come here and adjusted 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:20.250
 screw 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:23.730
 So the boy is already prepared that the 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:30.360
 bias if you put the fabric here 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:34.260
 in this part alone between listening is seeing the 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:38.790
 device checks for the bias and 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:41.570
 fabric together there under the pain of this 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:50.370
 sedimentary part of metal 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:55.460
 Low needle already in place to 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:55.460
 line does not come out and goes sewing 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:26.420
 and to take watch so with tissue and 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:29.270
 You see she has gone through sewing so much 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:35.210
 on one side as on the other 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:38.560
 at the same time and this is how you 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.560
 cesinha culture
