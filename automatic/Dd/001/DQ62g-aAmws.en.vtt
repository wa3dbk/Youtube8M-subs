hear this a different game and I think

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.170

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
that was the only game game I think we

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.109 
that was the only game game I think we
didn't<00:01:21.420> play<00:01:21.600> may<00:01:22.320> be<00:01:22.380> our<00:01:22.560> best<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.939> I

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
didn't play may be our best and and I

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.840 
didn't play may be our best and and I
was<00:01:24.630> kind<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:25.080> ops<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.950> game<00:01:26.159> guys<00:01:26.670> were

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
was kind of a ops a game guys were

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.660 
was kind of a ops a game guys were
pretty<00:01:27.030> down<00:01:27.509> about<00:01:27.540> losing<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.409> game<00:01:28.619> but<00:01:29.549> i

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
pretty down about losing that game but i

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.550 
pretty down about losing that game but i
think<00:01:29.850> we<00:01:30.000> regroup<00:01:30.630> pretty<00:01:30.900> well<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.290> it's

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
think we regroup pretty well and it's

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.200 
think we regroup pretty well and it's
not<00:01:31.740> every<00:01:31.979> day<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.130> play<00:01:32.460> for<00:01:32.700> an<00:01:32.820> Olympic

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
something out of there so I think that's

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.740 
something out of there so I think that's
the<00:02:55.459> biggest<00:02:55.670> thing<00:02:55.850> there's<00:02:56.269> been<00:02:56.420> a<00:02:56.450> lot<00:02:56.720> of

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
the biggest thing there's been a lot of

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.390 
the biggest thing there's been a lot of
discussion<00:02:57.380> locally<00:02:57.739> about<00:02:58.010> how<00:02:58.340> the

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
discussion locally about how the

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.449 
discussion locally about how the
Americans<00:02:58.760> approached<00:02:59.390> that<00:02:59.810> final<00:03:00.769> game<00:03:00.950> but

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
Americans approached that final game but

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:02.979 
Americans approached that final game but
you<00:03:01.700> guys<00:03:01.820> on<00:03:02.030> the<00:03:02.060> other<00:03:02.180> side<00:03:02.510> look<00:03:02.720> like<00:03:02.870> you

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
you guys on the other side look like you

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.699 
you guys on the other side look like you
were<00:03:03.109> had<00:03:03.680> everything<00:03:04.040> on<00:03:04.280> the<00:03:04.400> line<00:03:04.519> in<00:03:04.730> that

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
were had everything on the line in that

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.770 
were had everything on the line in that
well<00:03:06.709> I<00:03:06.769> think<00:03:06.859> us<00:03:07.310> the<00:03:07.700> first<00:03:08.329> period<00:03:08.540> they

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
well I think us the first period they

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.420 
well I think us the first period they
started<00:03:09.140> well<00:03:09.320> you<00:03:09.620> know<00:03:09.709> they<00:03:09.890> play<00:03:10.100> they

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
started well you know they play they

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.520 
started well you know they play they
wanted<00:03:10.790> the<00:03:10.880> bronze<00:03:11.120> I<00:03:11.450> could<00:03:11.750> see<00:03:11.930> that<00:03:12.079> so

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
wanted the bronze I could see that so

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.890 
wanted the bronze I could see that so
but<00:03:13.130> I<00:03:13.190> think<00:03:13.370> those<00:03:13.760> bronze<00:03:14.150> medal<00:03:14.480> games<00:03:14.630> we

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
but I think those bronze medal games we

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.590 
but I think those bronze medal games we
got<00:03:15.019> those<00:03:15.170> two<00:03:15.440> goals<00:03:15.680> right<00:03:16.519> away<00:03:16.790> and<00:03:17.060> it's

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
got those two goals right away and it's

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.449 
got those two goals right away and it's
it's<00:03:17.959> tough<00:03:18.200> to<00:03:18.380> regroup<00:03:18.739> after<00:03:19.010> you<00:03:19.310> know

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
it's tough to regroup after you know

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.430 
it's tough to regroup after you know
they<00:03:19.640> play<00:03:19.880> last<00:03:20.150> night<00:03:20.329> at<00:03:20.600> nine<00:03:20.750> o'clock<00:03:20.870> and

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
they play last night at nine o'clock and

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.190 
they play last night at nine o'clock and
tough<00:03:21.799> loss<00:03:22.070> for<00:03:22.100> them<00:03:22.430> so<00:03:23.329> again<00:03:23.780> it's<00:03:23.989> a

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
tough loss for them so again it's a

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.920 
tough loss for them so again it's a
mental<00:03:25.130> it's<00:03:25.310> tough<00:03:25.549> to<00:03:25.790> to<00:03:26.299> make<00:03:26.660> another

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
mental it's tough to to make another

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.870 
mental it's tough to to make another
push<00:03:27.230> after<00:03:27.560> you<00:03:27.620> go<00:03:27.769> down<00:03:27.980> to<00:03:28.280> nothing<00:03:28.760> again

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
push after you go down to nothing again

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.120 
push after you go down to nothing again
