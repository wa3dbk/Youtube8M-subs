usually there would only space out to
about<00:00:33.180> here<00:00:34.070> where<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.160> f<00:00:35.430> starts<00:00:36.090> for

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
about here where the f starts for

but yeah that's a pretty cool feature
within<00:02:28.390> the<00:02:28.570> newer<00:02:28.750> Safari<00:02:29.760> another<00:02:30.760> great

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
within the newer Safari another great

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.450 
within the newer Safari another great
feature<00:02:31.150> in<00:02:31.630> mountain<00:02:32.140> lion<00:02:32.440> is<00:02:32.680> the

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
feature in mountain lion is the

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.030 
feature in mountain lion is the
similarity<00:02:33.970> between<00:02:34.620> Google<00:02:35.620> Chrome<00:02:35.890> and

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
similarity between Google Chrome and

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.460 
similarity between Google Chrome and
Safari<00:02:36.420> now<00:02:37.420> what<00:02:37.570> I<00:02:37.600> mean<00:02:37.750> by<00:02:37.810> this<00:02:37.990> is<00:02:38.140> when

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
Safari now what I mean by this is when

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.040 
Safari now what I mean by this is when
you<00:02:38.620> create<00:02:39.400> new<00:02:39.520> tab<00:02:39.790> but<00:02:40.060> let's<00:02:40.180> say<00:02:40.360> if<00:02:40.900> you

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
you create new tab but let's say if you

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.690 
you create new tab but let's say if you
just<00:02:41.320> type<00:02:41.500> something<00:02:41.560> in<00:02:42.040> the<00:02:42.130> search<00:02:42.370> bar

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
just type something in the search bar

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.030 
just type something in the search bar
like<00:02:43.770> CNN<00:02:45.000> press<00:02:46.000> Enter<00:02:46.560> it<00:02:47.560> will<00:02:47.710> google

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
like CNN press Enter it will google

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.900 
like CNN press Enter it will google
search<00:02:48.250> it<00:02:48.280> straight<00:02:48.760> away<00:02:50.160> Safari<00:02:51.160> and<00:02:51.460> Apple

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
search it straight away Safari and Apple

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.610 
search it straight away Safari and Apple
have<00:02:52.030> taken<00:02:52.330> this<00:02:52.450> from<00:02:52.510> straight<00:02:53.440> from

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
have taken this from straight from

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.980 
have taken this from straight from
google<00:02:53.920> chrome<00:02:54.130> which<00:02:54.370> is<00:02:54.690> you<00:02:55.690> could<00:02:55.840> say

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
google chrome which is you could say

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.550 
google chrome which is you could say
copying<00:02:56.470> but<00:02:56.770> i<00:02:56.920> think<00:02:57.810> they<00:02:58.810> needed<00:02:59.200> to<00:02:59.230> do<00:02:59.440> it

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
copying but i think they needed to do it

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.430 
copying but i think they needed to do it
because<00:02:59.830> it's<00:03:00.010> a<00:03:00.280> really<00:03:00.580> good<00:03:00.640> feature<00:03:01.030> and<00:03:01.450> i

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
because it's a really good feature and i

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.920 
because it's a really good feature and i
think<00:03:02.800> it<00:03:02.920> will<00:03:03.040> help<00:03:03.190> a<00:03:03.490> lot<00:03:03.970> of<00:03:04.090> apple<00:03:04.600> users

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
think it will help a lot of apple users

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.230 
think it will help a lot of apple users

basically<00:03:28.480> a<00:03:28.600> really<00:03:28.840> fat<00:03:29.140> size<00:03:29.470> tab<00:03:29.860> and<00:03:30.130> when

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
basically a really fat size tab and when

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.180 
basically a really fat size tab and when
you<00:03:30.820> create<00:03:31.060> another<00:03:31.270> one<00:03:31.360> it<00:03:31.990> haves<00:03:32.350> and

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
you create another one it haves and

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.510 
you create another one it haves and
thence<00:03:33.790> go<00:03:34.060> into<00:03:34.270> thirds<00:03:34.600> two<00:03:35.170> quarters<00:03:35.620> and

thence go into thirds two quarters and

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.450 
thence go into thirds two quarters and
so<00:03:36.760> on<00:03:38.250> usually<00:03:39.630> there<00:03:40.630> wouldn't<00:03:40.930> be<00:03:41.050> a<00:03:41.080> tab

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:41.460
