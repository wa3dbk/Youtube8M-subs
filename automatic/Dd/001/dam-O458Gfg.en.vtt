00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 hey guys here is o'neill is one more 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.580
 video and first wanted to wish 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.170
 everybody Merry Christmas, a happy new year 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:14.880
 It's a home for us, but making videos. 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:17.279
 until 2015 but it is easy to say that the 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.210
 ASAP I spent very short 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.689
 long time 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.460
 the client is quite complicated this is the 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.310
 video that I promised initially after 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.970
 that I stopped drinking 2 on the on a 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:33.480
 game that I was going to start that was the guild 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.070
 wars 2 that in my opinion among the 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.469
 four games I'm testing 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.219
 to set at any time I go 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.910
 stay right 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.829
 these four games are thera desmate that 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.480
 It's the two games I've done I 've seen 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:51.780
 white age videos and finally the 22nd 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.670
 elton between these four games but you 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.250
 you will see what you understand enough 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.050
 interesting on the 22nd he works 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.989
 also with a system with tabi 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.760
 target system very similar to the 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.650
 perfect world in this respect 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.210
 only the interesting enough of it is 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.400
 that a class is not limited to doing 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.630
 only one type of work as per 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.090
 example perfect world you have one 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.909
 archer he only uses bow and since the 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.000
 garden and end point but nothing core 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.640
 Jorge 2 You have here that this in the 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.400
 if it 's a killer or a team 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.400
 in case it would be a thief he can use 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:30.960
 with him can use the sword he can use 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:34.290
 is the firearm he can use the bow or 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:38.659
 whether it gets a huge variation of 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.799
 skills situations is different then 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:49.070
 office for mac put fast in front 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:51.149
 by wen it does not look good 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.299
 continuing then you can have a 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:57.270
 great variety of skills a great 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.009
 variety of situations suddenly you 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.899
 faces a class that requires you to 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.450
 play closer or you're playing 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.770
 a battle of many against many 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.890
 so you can just play pro 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.770
 Air gun buying and so on. 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:14.010
 here you can change it is in that 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.799
 iso up where we poncet that here from the side 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.420
 What you squeeze and you exchange arms 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:21.360
 you can see that you the things that the 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.769
 So, for example, I'm now 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.189
 using the dagger 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:28.560
 I'm using the firearm , debate with 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:32.340
 he has another dagger than the dagger 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:35.250
 that here he has a squirrel that the 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.989
 combination of dagger with a firearm that 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.629
 would be number 3 right 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:41.970
 he shoots he's a shot on target 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:43.620
 it while giving the shot and 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.540
 comes from the guy's side so it's a 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.129
 combination of the two weapons 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:54.450
 good now we show some of the gameplay 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:56.609
 skills is the way I 'm going to test in that 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.329
 Magician is an excuse 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:02.329
 this deer is not one of those children who 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:04.709
 today daggers 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:07.260
 You see this is the first time the day 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.609
 of them that I of normal attack this one here 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.540
 It's more than what makes it come more 

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:17.310
 near the target even if it is distant 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:20.400
 He gets here from the shot I said. 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:25.250
 that getting this one right near here is 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.250
 of az the end that is the shot headshot 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:36.889
 now to show you a little bit the 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:44.389
 so he uses what is the bow ne 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:44.389
 yes, you can use it, I'll put it here 

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:48.470
 according to skills mode 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:57.400
 I think you can not use drugs, I said to 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:02.110
 to play in this way the skills of 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:05.530
 his bow is a two-handed weapon 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:08.140
 So there's an archer here too. 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:14.410
 ok this is the second time the Keeffe 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:18.430
 explodes on the ground holding multiple hits 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:20.019
 in him moving away, saying that he has 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:31.230
 Archer here that here the lights 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:33.640
 different is the last time the dna 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:37.380
 is poisonous and has a duty to show the 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:39.940
 You a little of his skills are 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.130
 a little bit of the game pedro jorge 2 a 1 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.690
 game with very graphics 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.860
 good if it has a variety of 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.600
 very good styles 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.700
 discovered the extremely fast video 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.100
 more to wish a merry christmas for everything 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:55.110

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:58.030
 hors between those four games that I 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.280
 I checked everything I liked best 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.200

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.390
