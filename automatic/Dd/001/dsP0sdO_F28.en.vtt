around<00:02:12.770> the<00:02:13.010> edge<00:02:13.160> and<00:02:13.550> then<00:02:13.660> once<00:02:14.660> I<00:02:14.750> want<00:02:14.930> to

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
around the edge and then once I want to

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:16.449

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
and the first thing we're gonna do is

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.360 
and the first thing we're gonna do is
I'm<00:02:29.360> gonna<00:02:29.450> put<00:02:29.630> a<00:02:29.690> little<00:02:29.840> dab<00:02:30.200> of<00:02:30.470> frosting

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
I'm gonna put a little dab of frosting

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.820 
I'm gonna put a little dab of frosting
right<00:02:31.760> there<00:02:32.120> and<00:02:32.870> I'm<00:02:33.019> gonna<00:02:33.110> invert<00:02:33.620> the

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
right there and I'm gonna invert the

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.190 
right there and I'm gonna invert the
cake<00:02:34.040> and<00:02:34.370> that'll<00:02:34.970> sort<00:02:35.570> of<00:02:35.630> like<00:02:35.720> glue<00:02:35.989> it'll

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
cake and that'll sort of like glue it'll

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.870 
cake and that'll sort of like glue it'll
adhere<00:02:36.350> to<00:02:36.769> the<00:02:36.890> surface<00:02:37.040> it's<00:02:37.430> gone<00:02:37.550> anywhere

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
adhere to the surface it's gone anywhere

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.699 
adhere to the surface it's gone anywhere
okay<00:02:38.390> then<00:02:39.260> so<00:02:40.070> I<00:02:40.130> put<00:02:40.310> a<00:02:40.340> little<00:02:40.459> filling<00:02:40.910> in

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
okay then so I put a little filling in

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.110 
okay then so I put a little filling in
between<00:02:42.709> a<00:02:42.739> quarter<00:02:43.070> cup<00:02:43.340> and<00:02:43.519> a<00:02:43.640> half<00:02:43.790> a<00:02:43.940> cup

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
between a quarter cup and a half a cup

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.890 
between a quarter cup and a half a cup
will<00:02:44.510> be<00:02:44.540> enough<00:02:46.180> just<00:02:47.180> enough<00:02:47.269> to<00:02:47.540> stick<00:02:47.780> the

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
will be enough just enough to stick the

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.660 
will be enough just enough to stick the
next<00:02:48.140> cake<00:02:48.350> on<00:02:48.560> and<00:02:48.830> again<00:02:49.310> I'm<00:02:49.430> going<00:02:49.549> to

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
next cake on and again I'm going to

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.670 
next cake on and again I'm going to
invert<00:02:49.970> it<00:02:50.150> and<00:02:50.299> that'll<00:02:50.959> reduce<00:02:51.140> the<00:02:51.440> number

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
invert it and that'll reduce the number

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.220 
invert it and that'll reduce the number
of<00:02:51.709> crumbs<00:02:52.330> then<00:02:53.330> we're<00:02:53.810> going<00:02:53.930> to<00:02:53.959> take<00:02:54.080> our

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.080

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
and there's not many exposed cut edges

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.960 
and there's not many exposed cut edges
on<00:03:32.210> this<00:03:32.390> so<00:03:32.570> we're<00:03:32.690> gonna<00:03:32.750> try<00:03:33.020> to<00:03:33.790> frost<00:03:34.790> it

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
on this so we're gonna try to frost it

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.270 
on this so we're gonna try to frost it
without<00:03:35.180> doing<00:03:35.630> a<00:03:35.720> crumb<00:03:35.900> coat<00:03:36.140> and<00:03:36.980> what's

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
without doing a crumb coat and what's

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.310 
without doing a crumb coat and what's
great<00:03:37.370> about<00:03:37.460> this<00:03:37.880> is<00:03:38.120> because<00:03:38.900> it's<00:03:39.110> an

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
great about this is because it's an

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.440 
great about this is because it's an
underwater<00:03:39.830> scene<00:03:40.280> you<00:03:40.850> don't<00:03:40.880> have<00:03:41.150> to<00:03:41.270> worry

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
underwater scene you don't have to worry

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:42.820

frosting on and then I'll create the

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:56.290 
frosting on and then I'll create the
texture<00:03:50.110> afterwards<00:03:54.940> so<00:03:55.940> now<00:03:56.060> I'm<00:03:56.150> going<00:03:56.240> to

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:56.300 
texture afterwards so now I'm going to

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.090 
texture afterwards so now I'm going to

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
flat of the offset spatula instead of

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:04.810 
flat of the offset spatula instead of

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
using the full length of it I'm just

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.760 
using the full length of it I'm just
using<00:04:04.970> the<00:04:05.150> tip<00:04:05.330> of<00:04:05.360> it<00:04:05.600> oh<00:04:05.750> and<00:04:06.110> I<00:04:06.230> sort<00:04:06.650> of

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:06.770 
using the tip of it oh and I sort of

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.150 
using the tip of it oh and I sort of
push<00:04:06.950> it<00:04:07.100> into<00:04:07.280> the<00:04:07.400> cake<00:04:07.720> and<00:04:08.720> that'll<00:04:09.350> create

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.160 
push it into the cake and that'll create

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.560 
push it into the cake and that'll create
