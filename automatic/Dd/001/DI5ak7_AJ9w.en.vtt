00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.640
 Do you want to find out interesting things about hamsters? 

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:04.500
 Let's see! 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.969
 First of all I want to talk about 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:13.799
 the origin of the word "hamster", which means "to accumulate" because they, 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.930
 all the food that I find in my jaws is like their nets 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.449
 shopping. Gather the food and take her home quickly. 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.489
 As for size, there are many varieties of hamsters, the largest 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:28.130
 among them is the Syrian, it can come to him 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.150
 measure 19 - 20 cm and weigh about 200 grams. 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:33.909
 The smallest of them 

00:00:33.909 --> 00:00:39.149
 is about 3 times smaller. It measures 7-8 centimeters 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.340
 at most. 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.800
 They are very small. Of all, the smallest 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.250
 are Roborovski, even when they are adults, they seem like some babies. 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:50.630
 In their natural habitat, 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.120
 they like to dig tunnels, because they are very hunted animals and 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.290
 I do this to hide. It is recommended to arrange for them 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.490
 tunnels in the cage, you will see that they like to hide in them. If you have more than one hamster, 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.510
 they will all be in the tunnel. 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.250
 They are great escapees, you have to take great care because 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.100
 escapes through the smallest hole. 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.190
 And ... a very interesting curiosity, it has attracted much attention to me, 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.190
 you know how many kilometers 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.830
 can I run in the wheel? Hear how hamsters run all night, 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.240
 silence, silence, taca? 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.410
 Well, a hamster can run up to 10 km in a single day. 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.410
 Hamsters are very smart, even though they often do not seem. Are 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.020
 very intelligent rodents, can learn many things, you can stimulate them 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.220
 with prizes because they can learn tricks, 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.600
 they recognize their parents, close family members. 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.090
 And the last thing, you have to be careful when joining a male with a female, 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.850
 because two things can happen: 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.670
 sometimes they do not get along well and they will argue, 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:00.140
 but if they do, they are much worse, because they are true factories 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.410
 of hamstars. 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.830
 Females have 6 or 8 puppies, but they have been given in 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.499
 even 19, 20. 

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:13.559
