00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.340
 then there was no debt 

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:08.710
 is the best car in history pinocho 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.610
 your balls down are steep but I bark 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.480
 it's better that he's in the story 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:15.549
 partner is needed for the entity the 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:23.340
 brushwood 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:23.340
 that's why buyers and things 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.270
 as well 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.840
 kid 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.539
 yes yes yes yes I have it in my head 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.430
 the illusion 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:09.220
 you are seeing two guys now clear how 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.570
 You can follow me on that curve after 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.460
 fact 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.670
 must do the guard and I hope that 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.670
 then 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.980
 the water was synchronized but we have 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.720
 fact 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.720
 you have to go for Ivan we do not throw 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.780
 it's a zero point of shit 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:52.340
 because it is also the best car 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.620
 base 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.620
 next 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.100
 obstacle 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.750
 I put both 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.550
 I could not get to the time 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.950
 Y 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:45.720
 in the head but we will accompany the 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.720
 commentators this charge 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:54.450
 because never 

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:05.599
 placed 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.599
 driving in perfect 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.870
 step 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:27.330
 and the trick is in the camera 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.330
 Of camera 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.390
 with the air 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:45.360
 but not all 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:57.810
 I'm getting dangerously close and like 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.810
 they arrived 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.010
 thanks for participating 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:19.190
 then a list of games that go 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.840
 all right 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:38.190
 For nothing to lose faith 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.169
 let's go to the portal 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:49.210
 Oh 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:49.210
