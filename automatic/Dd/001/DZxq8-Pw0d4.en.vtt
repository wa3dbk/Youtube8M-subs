00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 very good condition arising we are in 

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:06.450
 minecraft 1.7 points let's see a way 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.700
 that is not bad, what happens is 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.769
 which is not that it's super charles and 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.469
 track yes but the vision is not bad 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.299
 is that we go out here and as you can see 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.429
 all this full of flowers 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.960
 I do not know why but it 's full of 

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:23.769
 flowers I do not know if there will be a 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:26.649
 populated something because many times after 

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:31.269
 to record I start to investigate a 

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:34.300
 little bit and I find logical then not 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:38.460
 It looks like we do not come out with all that 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:40.480
 full of flowers of interest is the seed 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.550
 the coordinates does not matter because I'm 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.570
 right there but well this mode adds 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:49.600
 four different creepers let's see 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.570
 for example the fire 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:56.240
 Spain is that the design is quite 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:01:00.460
 pimp of us mola pile 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:03.960
 if we put gum and zero mode 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.940
 This crime is not leave you to fire beige 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.500
 Let's remove so if you 're not here 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.750
 I am I think it is the least dangerous 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.670
 of everything really then there is the line 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.670
 team kripper this more dangerous 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:20.700
 the design is its opening have respected 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:24.659
 a lot what is the normal clipper 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:28.050
 this expert that we fall a thunder 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:30.150
 that hurt a long time ago but good 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.250
 I dont know 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.190
 as you see a heart and a half but 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.470
 Nor is it good to start has to 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.280
 do hunt so very dangerous not 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.400
 then you walk away 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.150
 note that the thunder so here the 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.150
 nuclear kripper 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.560
 this gives me a little more fear 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.230
 all by saco good as you see this is 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.280
 far more dangerous than the expression 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.260
 what it does is huge 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.540
 that yes this simply this mode is 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.090
 to add a little bit of difficulty to the 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.410
 minecraft but the truth is that I've 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.460
 I have been looking and it is not that they have left 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.619
 many who have called me a lot 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.900
 attention the one that catches my attention 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.330
 It has been this but we have to 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.830
 other days have better modes because 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.450
 the other two more for example were a 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.490
 mine but they were pretty cool to 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:16.900
 true 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.930
 but we have also done some 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.600
 I showed creepers apart from this one that you 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.180
 I will leave you I will leave you in the description the 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.430
 videos we've done some and others since 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.590
 about clippers and they were also very 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.700
 hard but good this the speedy kripper 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:37.700
 This gives me more fear still 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:40.239
 let's put it there and the engines 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.239
 do not 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:03:01.209
 do not have a bad time now 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:01.209
 can not go up they already did 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.690
 all right 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.800
 the fleet that is wishing it 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.690
 but good as you can see is a mod that does not 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.340
 it's totally wrong add something more than 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.530
 difficulty but especially these that what 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.440
 you find in caves 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.220
 with this you have to be scared with what 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.810
 that runs the bug that you do not move 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.840
 fly if not if my uncle does not chase me 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.680
 my moves the shot but it is quite 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:34.330
 pretty good we're going to put all here 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.330
 the animals to the boy full diamond 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.040
 to the sea â€‹â€‹is here to see if I put 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.560
 to check that he released each one though 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:46.209
 I guess that they let go of gunpowder but 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:51.280
 I found this that is here x 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:51.280
 791 105 285 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.410
 there is fuck the there is because of the height 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.660
 but I always know that I am 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:03.760
 halderman that is going we will remove 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:07.150
 this and see that there is here gold bones a 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:10.720
 Emerald is cool for those iron gold 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:13.330
 iron bones and iron gold and a 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.490
 gold armor for the good horse 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.900
 today better than nothing but we are going to 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:19.500
 check what it was loose 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.500
 what I wanted to do 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.480
 we just gunpowder 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.810
 wonder of this we can already we could 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:37.620
 find the millions 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:40.790
 but not always loose but it does not matter 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:44.760
 loose diamonds to two others 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:46.410
 lighting this cool a lot to be able to fine-tune the 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.760
 world is much better than I 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.310
 I thought I thought they would let go 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.970
 Gunpowder is done but fuck this is cool 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:57.090
 much more I had loose to me to one like 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.919
 it's called faith church of these faith 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.090
 hills 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:03.440
 mother of my broth what to my name 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:07.030
 good if we already have seen this already 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.030
 and let's do speed and this 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:11.789
 sugar fruits thing this I would say that 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.240
 is one of the most complicated to kill for 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:17.360
 what runs dissolved sugar 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.860
 you are a little potato that knows it but 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.990
 well here is one of these these we 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.990
 loose blaze bars 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.140
 let's see if we see more these are the 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.570
 results for these are a tasting 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:32.240
 perfect so let's move on from them 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:34.640
 let's see if we find a lot of lighting 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.740
 of these oysters that happened that's in 

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.110
 diamond gave vale I guess these 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:41.230
 they will leave much less for what I am 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.230
 seeing 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:47.130
 of these blaze bars to review in 

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:48.900
 enough also which is saving going 

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:51.020
 to the level and they are killing break and they are a 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.020
 cognac 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:58.510
 and let's see this is not a normal flu 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:06:01.030
 you do not know the clippers that I want 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:03.880
 I want to see if many of them come out but 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:06.010
 it seems that no jobs is a shame I say 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:08.680
 that if you drop two diamonds if 

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:11.960
 they went out a lot flipa so that there 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:14.440
 these green fives that he gives us 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:17.100
 face cheste 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:20.530
 that is higher plus this result 2 

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:23.230
 ok here you are to think of less is 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:26.620
 logical also if loose loose 

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:29.310
 normal diamonds this glass is one 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:32.290
 you can have released me two but good 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:35.410
 it's pretty good about all this 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:38.620
 a lot but you have in the description 

00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:41.310
 is for 1.7 point 2 and will be with 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.310
 forge and so on 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:46.590
 bye
