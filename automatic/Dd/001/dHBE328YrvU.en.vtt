00:01:36.949 --> 00:01:36.959 
we see patients whose facial nerve has

we see patients whose facial nerve has
been<00:01:37.200> paralyzed<00:01:38.069> for<00:01:38.459> greater<00:01:38.789> than<00:01:38.940> a<00:01:39.119> month

the<00:01:40.440> first<00:01:40.739> thing<00:01:41.009> we'll<00:01:41.160> do<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.399> order

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
the first thing we'll do is order

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.380 
the first thing we'll do is order
radiographic<00:01:43.050> studies<00:01:43.099> usually<00:01:44.099> an<00:01:44.160> MRI<00:01:44.580> to

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
radiographic studies usually an MRI to

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.719 
radiographic studies usually an MRI to
make<00:01:45.569> sure<00:01:45.780> it's<00:01:45.929> not<00:01:46.110> due<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.679> tumor<00:01:47.190> so<00:01:47.610> if

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
make sure it's not due to a tumor so if

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.749 
make sure it's not due to a tumor so if
the<00:01:47.880> MRI<00:01:48.239> is<00:01:48.420> normal<00:01:48.959> and<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:50.130> facial

to<00:02:42.090> tell<00:02:42.330> us<00:02:42.480> that<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:43.170> nerve<00:02:43.380> is<00:02:43.560> intact<00:02:44.100> and

it's<00:02:44.489> safe<00:02:44.730> so<00:02:45.630> after<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.260> bone<00:02:46.470> is<00:02:46.680> removed

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
it's safe so after the bone is removed

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.990 
it's safe so after the bone is removed
