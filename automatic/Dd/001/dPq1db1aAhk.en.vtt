00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
slowly make our this makes the perfect

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.969 
slowly make our this makes the perfect
amount<00:01:45.280> now<00:01:45.780> if<00:01:46.780> you<00:01:47.080> have<00:01:47.260> one<00:01:47.560> of<00:01:47.650> these<00:01:47.710> guys

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
amount now if you have one of these guys

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:49.500 
amount now if you have one of these guys
it<00:01:48.159> might<00:01:48.280> make<00:01:48.430> less<00:01:48.670> it<00:01:48.820> might<00:01:48.940> make<00:01:49.060> more<00:01:49.270> so

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
it might make less it might make more so

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.260 
it might make less it might make more so
just<00:01:49.540> add<00:01:49.869> a<00:01:50.229> mixture<00:01:51.100> accordingly<00:01:51.610> and<00:01:51.909> you

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
just add a mixture accordingly and you

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.310 
just add a mixture accordingly and you
just<00:01:52.360> want<00:01:52.540> to<00:01:52.600> spoon<00:01:53.080> it<00:01:53.200> in<00:01:53.380> and<00:01:53.860> top<00:01:54.760> them<00:01:54.790> up

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
just want to spoon it in and top them up

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.440 
just want to spoon it in and top them up
right<00:01:56.320> pop<00:01:56.830> the<00:01:56.950> lids<00:01:57.130> on<00:01:57.280> and<00:01:57.490> I've<00:01:58.210> never

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
right pop the lids on and I've never

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.789 
right pop the lids on and I've never
actually<00:01:58.630> timed<00:01:58.990> it<00:01:59.170> but<00:01:59.409> I'm<00:01:59.530> going<00:01:59.650> to<00:01:59.710> put

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
actually timed it but I'm going to put

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:01.469 
actually timed it but I'm going to put
it<00:01:59.860> in<00:01:59.890> the<00:01:59.979> freezer<00:02:00.130> now<00:02:00.400> and<00:02:00.670> I'm<00:02:01.000> guessing

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
it in the freezer now and I'm guessing

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:02.850 
it in the freezer now and I'm guessing
it<00:02:01.570> should<00:02:01.720> take<00:02:01.840> about<00:02:01.930> two<00:02:02.260> to<00:02:02.290> three<00:02:02.470> hours

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
it should take about two to three hours

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.620 
it should take about two to three hours
