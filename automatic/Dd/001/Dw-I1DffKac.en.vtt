00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.929 

now<00:01:59.060> that<00:01:59.240> we've<00:01:59.390> taken<00:01:59.990> the<00:02:00.259> other<00:02:00.350> rings<00:02:00.649> off

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:00.939 
now that we've taken the other rings off

now that we've taken the other rings off
we've<00:02:01.939> cleaned<00:02:02.240> it<00:02:02.390> especially<00:02:03.320> the<00:02:03.439> surfaces

now<00:02:06.439> it's<00:02:06.679> time<00:02:06.920> to<00:02:06.950> put<00:02:07.340> on<00:02:07.460> the<00:02:07.490> new<00:02:07.670> rings

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
now it's time to put on the new rings

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.309 
now it's time to put on the new rings
the<00:02:09.619> chain<00:02:09.860> rings<00:02:10.069> all<00:02:10.250> have<00:02:10.429> a<00:02:10.459> mark<00:02:10.759> and

the chain rings all have a mark and
indicator<00:02:12.430> usually<00:02:13.430> mechanical<00:02:14.030> like<00:02:14.239> this

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
so that the laser marking is out so it's

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.800 
so that the laser marking is out so it's
going<00:02:25.790> to<00:02:25.879> go<00:02:26.000> on<00:02:26.150> like<00:02:26.180> so<00:02:28.450> for<00:02:29.450> the<00:02:29.540> two<00:02:29.690> by

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
going to go on like so for the two by

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.440 
going to go on like so for the two by
ten<00:02:30.019> conversion<00:02:32.920> double<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:34.010> triple<00:02:34.370> we<00:02:35.239> use

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
ten conversion double the triple we use

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.949

these<00:02:35.660> small<00:02:36.400> pieces<00:02:37.400> here<00:02:38.000> to<00:02:38.180> go<00:02:38.360> in<00:02:38.599> place

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
these small pieces here to go in place

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
of where the big ring once was so we'll

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.350 
of where the big ring once was so we'll
take<00:02:43.220> and<00:02:43.459> mount<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:44.690> chain<00:02:44.989> ring<00:02:46.090> just<00:02:47.090> like

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
take and mount the chain ring just like

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.979 
take and mount the chain ring just like
the<00:02:47.569> big<00:02:47.750> ring<00:02:47.959> had<00:02:48.230> been<00:02:48.260> mounted<00:02:49.989> except

the big ring had been mounted except

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:56.110 
the big ring had been mounted except
we'll<00:02:51.170> use<00:02:51.380> these<00:02:51.620> small<00:02:52.450> tabs<00:02:54.670> to<00:02:55.670> take<00:02:55.910> the

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
we'll use these small tabs to take the

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.330 
we'll use these small tabs to take the
space<00:02:56.450> on<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:57.019> place<00:02:57.349> of<00:02:57.680> where<00:02:57.890> that<00:02:58.069> big

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
space on the place of where that big
