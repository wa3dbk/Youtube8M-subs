00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.120
 hi friends we are on 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.580
 appleinsider.ru and if you are here with us 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.590
 it means you also like apple technique 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.000
 Use and and somehow protect against 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.010
 gravity adversity harsh reality 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.750
 our main work machines 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.820
 for example, are MacBooks for work 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.470
 sometimes it is necessary happens quickly and urgently 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.600
 Well, at least move around the city 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.430
 by itself with a laptop which is very 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.589
 promptly and carefully tossed into a backpack 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.780
 and there is neatly surrounded by wires with 

00:00:33.589 --> 00:00:38.449
 Charges and other things are not very soft and 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.489
 delicate things yes there are all sorts of daddies and 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:43.100
 to that similar useful storages but on 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.260
 10 times push the macbook out of 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.120
 dense neoprene nests are annoying and 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.719
 the case is sent to collect dust in 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.549
 far corner 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:51.739
 however there is a type of covers which 

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:53.089
 allows you to at least avoid unnecessary 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:53.749
 action and appearance while 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:55.579
 diversity 

00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:57.469
 today we have clip case covers and for 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.209
 Macbooks from the Dutch company giving 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.670
 which are called respectively 

00:00:59.209 --> 00:01:03.499
 Dutch dorking what on eternal 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.059
 language means prospects let's 

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:06.890
 let's see what the prospects are 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.810
 open to those who imagine these 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.610
 Covers will lead in principle about packaging 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.710
 say nothing great thick cardboard 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.570
 plastic cat showing color 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.900
 clip case and came to the store chosen 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.450
 Colour 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.670
 left satisfied mass of light green colors 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.140
 blue lemon black orange 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.270
 orange macbook isn't it great 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.670
 it is clear that all sorts of vinyl stickers 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.740
 there are even three color variations 12 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.900
 inch macbook and macbook a but among 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.060
 there is nothing neon bright joyful 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.950
 and summer plastic outside soft-touch then 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.270
 there are prints of wet hands he sometimes with 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.340
 saves himself with joy 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.230
 they are also eliminated without any problems 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.970
 plastic light translucent but 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.630
 enough for an apple 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.700
 glowed 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.220
 what liked in these cases so it 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.570
 height of legs the lion's share of similar clip 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.610
 cases come with a standard 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.980
 stamping under the usual legs of laptops 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.420
 in giving these products you and punching 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.070
 shifted noticeable in height 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.020
 non-slip feet so laptop 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.479
 rises above the table a little more 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.280
 usual in theory poured next to the laptop 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.830
 in this case drink inside the computer 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.600
 will not hit the vents on 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.729
 The bottom half of the cover is designed to protect 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.920
 macbook bottom abound so 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.350
 overheating of the computer too is not threatened and well 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.910
 legs high again both 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.890
 the furnaces have a slightly higher inflow 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.480
 air to where it is needed in 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.100
 Kit to these covers is the way 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.200
 silicone pad on the keyboard 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.030
 the solution is rather shipping to 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.470
 the buttons on the display were not printed from 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.810
 overpressure in a backpack 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.610
 we really did find more interesting 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.440
 application and now your keyboard 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.300
 working machines we cover this thin 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.870
 silicone wrap during dinner 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.270
 breaks 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.670
 well chips chips from burgers other 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.590
 healthy hearty food for some reason she 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.870
 inherently that gets exclusively 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.730
 on the keyboard is not clogged only 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.830
 the most awkward slots and turn over 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.200
 macbook and knocking them on the table but the thing 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.970
 not very productive then the truth went 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.340
 more interesting idea for example you fry 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.960
 barbecue or change the oil in the car and you 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.190
 We must urgently respond to the message in 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.470
 telegram from your macbook 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.880
 hands wash napkins look well you get it with 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.860
 one thing, the idea is pretty 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.840
 utopian although someone may 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.910
 need to print for a long time through this 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.500
 the cover really does not work but here 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.990
 rather a matter of habit than a clear 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.850
 discomfort the stroke of the keys change the response 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:11.770
 a bit different unusually categorically in 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.810
 overall by the way the Dutch company itself 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.580
 daf creator data covers strongly 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.680
 recommends cheholchik once a month 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.510
 laptop still take off and wipe it 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.680
 the insides and the outer surface and 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:22.390
 Macbook dry cloth 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.640
 from and motes anyway anyway 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.800
 sometimes large sometimes not only 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.510
 dust particles and how would a good and tight case 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.250
 not sitting can start abrasion 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.930
 surface of your favorite aluminum 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.920
 comrade 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.900
 Those interested are advised to look for them. 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.270
 example in restore or appstore. RU 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.010
 the thing is very decent and useful and that 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.360
 most importantly cover essentially all 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.180
 range of mobile computers 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.160
 Apple is here for you and air and pro and 11 inches and 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.350
