00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:15.959
 [Music] 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.840
 excellent 200 stereo amplifier 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:21.180
 watts ideal for video rock or brings them 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.009
 volume control balance and tones 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.689
 controlled by voltage that allows 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:26.669
 place the control potentiometer 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.300
 up to 30 meters away from 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:31.560
 amplifier without introducing any noise 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.279
 You can also use the volume control 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.279
 infrared 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.270
 this amplifier is a development that 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.800
 has been applied approximately in a 40 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.050
 percent of jukeboxes videos 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.500
 made in colombia 'making of it 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.270
 an ideal amplifier tested effective and 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.580
 added to its low cost easy 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.379
 construction has extended its use to 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:57.210
 amplify the sound of the computer in 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:59.460
 home or business if you want to know 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.070
 how to build this amplifier should 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.960
 read our recommendations section 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.729
 watch the amplifier video of 200 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.860
 watts that is in the sound section 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.899
 and the video of the volume control and 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.030
 tones controlled by tension since 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:14.280
 this amplifier is the sum of these 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.380
 two projects 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.810
 it is important to keep in mind that at 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.340
 moment to assemble the amplifier there 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.610
 have to be clear about the position of 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.770
 components especially the transistors 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:28.979
 diodes and capacitors for this follow the 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.440
 Component mask guide the 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.649
 200 watt amplifier uses source 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.770
 symmetric or dual plus minus 45 volts 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:40.470
 of cee that equals 33 volts for 33 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.290
 volts does this means that the 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.600
 total voltage of 90 volts has a ce 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.390
 middle point which is taken as earth 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.580
 or 0 volts for this reason we use a 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.230
 central contact transformer and a 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.540
 12 volt additional winding 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.010
 instead of placing the potentiometer 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.830
 volume directly in Bakelite 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:03.200
 we place a 6-pin connector to which 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.420
 we remove a pin in between and a 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.570
 2-pin connector that comes from the 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.910
 ta 76 30 power to connect 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:13.130
 the volume potentiometer to a cable and 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.080
 take it away from the card 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.820
 in another case we can connect the control 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.180
 of infrared volume that is found 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:21.770
 in our projects section 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.080
 we have placed an exit for a 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.940
 12 volt fan using the 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.270
 positive power supply voltage 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.790
 amplifier as they are more 45 volts 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.620
 approximately it is necessary to reduce the 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.620
 voltage so that the fan does not 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.510
 We hope that this project will be 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.790
 taken advantage of by the people who want 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.740
 have a good sound and also can 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.040
 have a source of income to 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:49.410
 develop them and market them now 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.230
 we present a live sound test 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:55.940
 hello everyone we present below 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:58.050
 the 200-watt amplifier added to the 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.180
 preamplifier with tones and volume 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:04.080
 controlled by tension in which 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:06.950
 we use the 7630 pea we have also 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.360
 adapted wireless remote control 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:11.430
 by infrared 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.800
 in this case we do not need to make a 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.380
 tutorial for these three projects 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:20.810
 since each one is independent 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.810

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.640
 let's notice that it goes up to go down volume 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:50.640
