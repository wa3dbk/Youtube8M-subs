00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
video with the high 0.995 and this is

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.280 
video with the high 0.995 and this is
also<00:00:11.250> simulating<00:00:12.030> engaging<00:00:12.480> a<00:00:12.690> target<00:00:13.110> at<00:00:13.259> a

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
also simulating engaging a target at a

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.279 
also simulating engaging a target at a
hundred<00:00:13.620> meters<00:00:14.030> the<00:00:15.030> target<00:00:15.690> is<00:00:15.809> at<00:00:15.960> 100

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
hundred meters the target is at 100

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.630 
hundred meters the target is at 100
meters<00:00:18.230> 18<00:00:19.230> by<00:00:19.380> 20<00:00:19.740> inch<00:00:19.920> as<00:00:20.220> I've<00:00:20.430> said<00:00:20.580> before

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
meters 18 by 20 inch as I've said before

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.849 
meters 18 by 20 inch as I've said before
in<00:00:21.000> other<00:00:21.090> videos<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.960> it's<00:00:22.529> going<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.710> be

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
in other videos and it's going to be

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.740 
in other videos and it's going to be
rapid<00:00:23.279> fire<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:23.850> I'm<00:00:24.060> going<00:00:24.210> to<00:00:24.269> do<00:00:24.390> it<00:00:24.510> from<00:00:24.600> a

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
rapid fire and I'm going to do it from a

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.080 
rapid fire and I'm going to do it from a
kneeling<00:00:25.019> position<00:00:25.199> this<00:00:25.769> time<00:00:25.830> I<00:00:26.279> just<00:00:26.670> did<00:00:27.060> a

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
kneeling position this time I just did a

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.479 
kneeling position this time I just did a
video<00:00:27.240> with<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.230> M&amp;P<00:00:28.910> where<00:00:31.399> hopefully<00:00:32.399> it

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
video with the M&amp;P where hopefully it

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.410 
video with the M&amp;P where hopefully it
turned<00:00:32.669> out<00:00:32.850> okay

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
turned out okay

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.620 
turned out okay
the<00:00:33.770> M&amp;P<00:00:34.770> 40<00:00:35.250> that<00:00:35.370> I<00:00:35.430> shot<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:35.700> did<00:00:36.030> 15<00:00:36.390> rounds

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
the M&amp;P 40 that I shot I did 15 rounds

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:37.940 
the M&amp;P 40 that I shot I did 15 rounds
from<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.809> standing<00:00:37.200> position<00:00:37.260> kind<00:00:37.829> of

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
from a standing position kind of

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.780 
from a standing position kind of
suppressive<00:00:38.430> fire<00:00:38.640> at<00:00:39.629> 100<00:00:40.110> meters<00:00:40.670> so<00:00:41.670> now

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
suppressive fire at 100 meters so now

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.160 
suppressive fire at 100 meters so now
we're<00:00:41.910> going<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.059> use<00:00:42.239> this<00:00:42.390> high<00:00:42.570> point<00:00:42.780> model

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
we're going to use this high point model

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.639 
we're going to use this high point model
99<00:00:43.469> 5<00:00:43.800> do<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.370> same<00:00:44.610> thing<00:00:44.879> but<00:00:45.559> we're<00:00:46.559> gonna

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
99 5 do the same thing but we're gonna

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.500 
99 5 do the same thing but we're gonna
do<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:46.950> from<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.160> kneeling<00:00:47.340> position<00:00:47.520> so

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
do it from a kneeling position so

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.450 
do it from a kneeling position so
basically<00:00:49.020> I'm<00:00:49.230> coming<00:00:49.559> up<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.829> corridor<00:00:50.160> I

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
basically I'm coming up to a corridor I

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.819 
basically I'm coming up to a corridor I
see<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.700> threat<00:00:51.030> I<00:00:51.239> take<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:51.960> kneeling<00:00:52.230> position

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
see a threat I take a kneeling position

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.360 
see a threat I take a kneeling position
nice<00:00:53.250> solid<00:00:53.579> position<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.590> I<00:00:55.590> engage<00:00:55.890> as<00:00:56.160> fast

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
nice solid position and I engage as fast

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.139 
nice solid position and I engage as fast
as<00:00:56.579> I<00:00:56.640> can

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
as I can

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.990 
as I can
and<00:00:57.770> basically<00:00:58.770> I<00:00:59.100> want<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.460> get<00:00:59.579> that<00:00:59.730> target

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
and basically I want to get that target

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:35.819 
and basically I want to get that target
to<00:01:00.180> move<00:01:00.510> so<00:01:01.140> let's<00:01:01.770> go<00:01:01.859> ahead<00:01:01.980> get<00:01:02.129> started

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:35.829 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:39.550 

you<00:01:36.829> can<00:01:36.979> see<00:01:37.159> I<00:01:37.189> scored<00:01:37.640> some<00:01:37.700> hits<00:01:38.560> this

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
you can see I scored some hits this

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:45.130 
you can see I scored some hits this
highpoint<00:01:40.070> performs<00:01:40.579> really<00:01:40.759> well<00:01:42.220> and<00:01:44.140> there

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
highpoint performs really well and there

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.510 
highpoint performs really well and there
it<00:01:45.259> is<00:01:45.320> that's<00:01:45.590> basically<00:01:46.009> the<00:01:46.159> whole<00:01:46.280> point

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
it is that's basically the whole point

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.310 
it is that's basically the whole point
of<00:01:46.580> the<00:01:46.670> drill<00:01:46.939> you<00:01:47.420> know<00:01:47.509> can<00:01:48.020> I<00:01:48.110> take<00:01:48.289> a

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
of the drill you know can I take a

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.749 
of the drill you know can I take a
little<00:01:48.590> gun<00:01:48.770> such<00:01:49.070> as<00:01:49.220> this<00:01:49.369> and<00:01:49.579> any

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
little gun such as this and any

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.359 
little gun such as this and any
expensive<00:01:50.149> gun<00:01:50.360> and<00:01:51.289> can<00:01:51.590> I<00:01:51.680> use<00:01:51.860> it<00:01:51.890> again<00:01:52.130> I

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
expensive gun and can I use it again I

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.490 
expensive gun and can I use it again I
hit<00:01:52.610> a<00:01:52.640> target<00:01:53.060> at<00:01:53.149> 100<00:01:53.450> meters<00:01:53.750> halfway

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
hit a target at 100 meters halfway

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.980 
hit a target at 100 meters halfway
decently<00:01:54.920> you<00:01:55.250> could<00:01:55.509> hopefully<00:01:56.509> you<00:01:56.810> heard

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
decently you could hopefully you heard

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.499 
decently you could hopefully you heard
the<00:01:57.140> hits<00:01:57.350> and<00:01:57.530> the<00:01:58.490> misses<00:01:58.850> were<00:01:59.030> just<00:01:59.330> barely

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
the hits and the misses were just barely

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:02.560 
the hits and the misses were just barely
misses<00:02:00.049> if<00:02:00.350> it<00:02:00.530> was<00:02:00.649> an<00:02:00.770> actual<00:02:01.210> human<00:02:02.210> size

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
misses if it was an actual human size

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.510 
misses if it was an actual human size
target<00:02:02.600> out<00:02:03.170> there<00:02:03.200> I<00:02:03.679> think<00:02:04.100> it<00:02:04.340> would<00:02:04.429> have

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
target out there I think it would have

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.950 
target out there I think it would have
still<00:02:04.670> been<00:02:04.729> hits<00:02:05.060> cuz<00:02:05.330> we're<00:02:05.539> talking<00:02:05.869> he

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
still been hits cuz we're talking he

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.270 
still been hits cuz we're talking he
hits<00:02:06.170> in<00:02:06.289> the<00:02:06.380> extremities<00:02:06.920> and<00:02:07.130> what

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
hits in the extremities and what

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.709 
hits in the extremities and what
continent<00:02:07.989> so<00:02:08.989> thanks<00:02:09.350> a<00:02:09.410> lot<00:02:09.440> for<00:02:09.619> watching
