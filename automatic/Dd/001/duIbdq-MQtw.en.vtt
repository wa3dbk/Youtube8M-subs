select cable here as you can see I
marked<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.450> area<00:00:15.809> where<00:00:16.020> I<00:00:16.170> like<00:00:17.060> my<00:00:18.060> Schiff

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:18.350 
marked the area where I like my Schiff

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:22.810 
marked the area where I like my Schiff

feel on it with a silver permanent
marker<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:24.680> can<00:00:25.680> adjust<00:00:26.160> it<00:00:27.170> either<00:00:28.849> up<00:00:29.849> the

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
marker you can adjust it either up the

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.720 
marker you can adjust it either up the
shaft<00:00:30.800> or<00:00:31.800> down<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.880> shaft<00:00:34.489> make<00:00:35.489> sure<00:00:35.640> you

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
shaft or down the shaft make sure you

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.580 
shaft or down the shaft make sure you
put<00:00:35.940> put<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.480> in<00:00:36.600> neutral<00:00:36.750> first<00:00:38.059> and<00:00:39.440> you<00:00:40.440> can

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
put put it in neutral first and you can

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.500 
put put it in neutral first and you can
adjust<00:00:40.760> by<00:00:41.760> pulling<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.300> piece<00:00:43.260> here<00:00:43.469> back

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
here and move it up the shaft or down

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.520 
here and move it up the shaft or down
the<00:01:04.350> shaft<00:01:05.299> as<00:01:06.299> you<00:01:06.450> can<00:01:06.570> see<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:06.869> little<00:01:07.020> tip

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
the shaft as you can see that little tip

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.190 
the shaft as you can see that little tip
out<00:01:07.710> there<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.820> moving<00:01:09.180> that's<00:01:09.659> your<00:01:09.810> marking

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
out there and moving that's your marking

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.060 
out there and moving that's your marking
point<00:01:11.270> if<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:12.420> pull<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:12.659> all<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:12.990> way<00:01:13.110> up<00:01:13.200> push

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
point if I pull it all the way up push

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.109 
point if I pull it all the way up push
down<00:01:14.310> on<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.810> lock

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.609 

as<00:01:18.539> you<00:01:18.929> can<00:01:19.079> see<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.740> tit<00:01:19.979> is<00:01:21.049> way<00:01:22.049> down<00:01:22.560> in

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
as you can see the tit is way down in

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:31.550 
as you can see the tit is way down in
there<00:01:22.950> versus<00:01:23.880> where<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.090> put<00:01:24.359> my<00:01:24.390> mark<00:01:30.560> which

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
there versus where I put my mark which

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.370 
there versus where I put my mark which
changes<00:01:32.069> the<00:01:32.250> shift<00:01:32.549> feel<00:01:33.380> and

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
changes the shift feel and

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:41.090 
changes the shift feel and
characteristics<00:01:38.090> see<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.740> think<00:01:40.740> that's<00:01:40.920> why

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
characteristics see I think that's why

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.160 
characteristics see I think that's why
some<00:01:41.429> of<00:01:41.459> you<00:01:41.729> guys<00:01:41.939> are<00:01:42.299> having<00:01:42.539> problems

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
some of you guys are having problems

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.410 
some of you guys are having problems
with<00:01:44.090> not<00:01:45.090> going<00:01:45.390> into<00:01:45.600> gear<00:01:45.929> like<00:01:46.319> this

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
with not going into gear like this

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.929 
with not going into gear like this
because<00:01:48.420> it's<00:01:48.630> out<00:01:48.840> of<00:01:49.399> basically<00:01:50.399> alignment

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
because it's out of basically alignment

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.639 
because it's out of basically alignment
or<00:01:51.030> sync<00:01:51.319> and<00:01:52.319> your<00:01:52.770> cable<00:01:52.979> stretches<00:01:54.649> and

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
or sync and your cable stretches and

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.510 
or sync and your cable stretches and
then<00:01:55.799> when<00:01:55.890> you<00:01:55.979> put<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.159> new<00:01:56.340> shifter<00:01:56.819> in<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:57.119> it

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:58.520 
then when you put a new shifter in it it

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.559 
then when you put a new shifter in it it
puts<00:01:59.520> it<00:01:59.610> at<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.729> different<00:02:00.060> position<00:02:00.179> than

00:02:00.559 --> 00:02:00.569 
puts it at a different position than

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:03.679 
puts it at a different position than
originally<00:02:01.530> would<00:02:01.879> you<00:02:02.879> now<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.060> can't<00:02:03.390> get<00:02:03.569> it

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
originally would you now I can't get it

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.260 
originally would you now I can't get it
in<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.840> first<00:02:04.110> or<00:02:04.349> second<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.099> get<00:02:05.909> into<00:02:06.149> the

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
in the first or second and get into the

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.550 
in the first or second and get into the
third<00:02:06.920> and<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:08.310> little<00:02:08.729> bit<00:02:08.849> fifth<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.329> six<00:02:09.599> but

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
third and a little bit fifth and six but

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.550 
third and a little bit fifth and six but
it's<00:02:10.709> off<00:02:10.979> their<00:02:11.430> case<00:02:13.280> but<00:02:14.599> okay<00:02:15.599> so<00:02:16.230> we'll

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
it's off their case but okay so we'll

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.569 
it's off their case but okay so we'll
put<00:02:16.739> it<00:02:16.829> all<00:02:16.950> back<00:02:17.629> to<00:02:18.629> the<00:02:18.660> other<00:02:18.930> direction

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:19.579 
put it all back to the other direction

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:32.570 
put it all back to the other direction
or<00:02:20.579> move<00:02:20.790> it<00:02:20.910> up<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.180> shaft

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.840 

okay<00:02:33.580> as<00:02:33.640> you<00:02:33.880> can<00:02:33.910> see<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.300> tit<00:02:34.569> is<00:02:35.520> way<00:02:36.520> up

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
okay as you can see the tit is way up

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:51.920 
okay as you can see the tit is way up
here<00:02:37.150> now

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.260 

well<00:02:52.930> fifth<00:02:53.230> and<00:02:53.410> six<00:02:53.640> one<00:02:54.640> into<00:02:54.910> the<00:02:55.030> fifth

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
well fifth and six one into the fifth

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.199 
well fifth and six one into the fifth
and<00:02:55.480> sixth<00:02:55.750> side<00:02:55.900> is<00:02:56.050> what<00:02:56.170> a<00:02:56.200> harder<00:02:56.560> here

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
and sixth side is what a harder here

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:13.699 
and sixth side is what a harder here
then<00:02:58.209> we'll<00:02:58.360> put<00:02:58.480> it<00:02:58.569> back<00:02:58.600> the<00:02:59.350> way<00:02:59.380> I<00:02:59.860> had<00:03:00.430> it

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.860 

now<00:03:14.709> you<00:03:14.950> can<00:03:15.100> see<00:03:15.130> the<00:03:15.400> little<00:03:15.670> tit<00:03:16.269> is<00:03:16.510> lined

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
now you can see the little tit is lined

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.750 
now you can see the little tit is lined
up<00:03:16.989> with<00:03:17.050> my<00:03:17.319> silver<00:03:17.650> permanent<00:03:18.310> marker<00:03:18.550> mark

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
up with my silver permanent marker mark

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:26.520 
up with my silver permanent marker mark
right<00:03:19.030> there<00:03:24.600> first<00:03:25.600> second<00:03:26.050> third<00:03:26.200> fourth

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
right there first second third fourth

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:44.539 
right there first second third fourth
fifth<00:03:26.709> sixth<00:03:40.829> but<00:03:41.829> after<00:03:42.730> putting<00:03:42.910> in<00:03:43.209> the

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
fifth sixth but after putting in the

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:48.960 
fifth sixth but after putting in the
training<00:03:45.549> mounts<00:03:45.880> both<00:03:46.720> medieval<00:03:47.350> and<00:03:47.940> PTP<00:03:48.940> I

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
training mounts both medieval and PTP I

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.190 
training mounts both medieval and PTP I
think<00:03:49.329> I've<00:03:49.540> kinked<00:03:50.200> my<00:03:51.209> selector<00:03:52.209> cable<00:03:52.690> I'll

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
think I've kinked my selector cable I'll

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.569 
think I've kinked my selector cable I'll
buy<00:03:53.410> the<00:03:53.470> transmission<00:03:54.160> area<00:03:54.370> by<00:03:54.519> the

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 
buy the transmission area by the

buy the transmission area by the

slot<00:04:00.250> here<00:04:00.700> if<00:04:00.910> you<00:04:01.359> let<00:04:02.170> it<00:04:02.290> go<00:04:02.820> it<00:04:03.820> goes<00:04:04.030> back

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:04.299 
slot here if you let it go it goes back

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:05.880 
slot here if you let it go it goes back
into<00:04:04.510> the<00:04:04.600> area<00:04:05.019> of<00:04:05.079> the<00:04:05.350> third<00:04:05.530> and<00:04:05.680> fourth

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
into the area of the third and fourth

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.449 
into the area of the third and fourth
slot<00:04:06.160> area<00:04:06.780> automatically<00:04:07.780> springing<00:04:08.320> back

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
slot area automatically springing back

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.160 
slot area automatically springing back
but<00:04:09.459> if<00:04:09.549> you<00:04:09.579> go<00:04:09.760> to<00:04:09.820> the<00:04:09.880> fifth<00:04:10.090> and<00:04:10.269> six<00:04:10.540> it's

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
but if you go to the fifth and six it's

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.979 
but if you go to the fifth and six it's
harder<00:04:11.709> and<00:04:12.299> it<00:04:13.299> doesn't<00:04:13.570> want<00:04:13.660> to<00:04:13.720> spring

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
harder and it doesn't want to spring

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:26.390 
harder and it doesn't want to spring
back<00:04:14.200> I<00:04:15.090> have<00:04:16.090> to<00:04:16.209> pull<00:04:16.419> it<00:04:16.539> back

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.600 

so<00:04:27.400> it<00:04:27.520> looks<00:04:27.699> like<00:04:27.789> I'm<00:04:28.030> gonna<00:04:28.240> need<00:04:28.330> another

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
so it looks like I'm gonna need another

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.290 
so it looks like I'm gonna need another
slight<00:04:30.610> cable<00:04:31.710> well<00:04:32.710> that's<00:04:32.949> it<00:04:33.250> I<00:04:33.490> can

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
slight cable well that's it I can

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.779 
slight cable well that's it I can
fine-tune<00:04:34.629> your<00:04:36.810> shifting<00:04:37.810> here<00:04:38.789> and

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:39.789 
fine-tune your shifting here and

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:41.279 
fine-tune your shifting here and
hopefully<00:04:40.120> that<00:04:40.419> will<00:04:40.509> fix<00:04:40.689> some<00:04:40.960> of<00:04:40.990> the<00:04:41.139> guys

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:41.289 
hopefully that will fix some of the guys

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:46.740 
hopefully that will fix some of the guys
that<00:04:41.530> have<00:04:41.860> a<00:04:42.509> not<00:04:43.509> going<00:04:43.810> into<00:04:44.050> gear<00:04:44.259> problems
