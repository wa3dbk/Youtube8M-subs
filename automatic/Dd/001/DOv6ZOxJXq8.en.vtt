 Hello 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.520
 Welcome to the new 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.509
 Klingon course My name is Love 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:28.130
 liter I am your Klingon teacher 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:29.809
 There are so many tv shows 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.550
 in the meantime, they too 

00:00:29.809 --> 00:00:33.200
 allusions to the Klingon 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.870
 so language does not just have to star 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.300
 trek one of the most popular of the last 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.390
 time is definitely the bigbank 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.760
 not just that sheldon here and 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.250
 as sometimes a little kaplan lets go 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.410
 but there is a very popular scene 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.390
 where a very long sentence occurs in it 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.660
 then we'll have a look 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.660
 here at 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:04.010

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.400
 served cold in Klingon I said 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:15.090

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.950
 what's up with the shooting yes to it 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.590
 To sum it up was a scene 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.300
 when the sheldon wanted to revenge anvil 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.580

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.490
 times at a conference and indeed 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.369
 This set is an original 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:31.680
 Klingon saying and revenge 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.410
 a dish is the best cold 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.410
 is served in Klingon this means 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:41.610
 motto hard job 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.960
 the octopus so one has seen the 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.570
 pronunciation was certainly not so 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:51.090

 the double beer after krakow means 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:24.799

 Porter game I have the right one more 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.950
 did not want to say that the sentence is 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.620
 in itself certainly long enough 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.739
