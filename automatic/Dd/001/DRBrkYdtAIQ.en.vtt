untrue Nations champions at the moment
which<00:02:24.230> you<00:02:24.890> know<00:02:25.010> is<00:02:25.390> fantastic<00:02:26.390> achievement

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
which you know is fantastic achievement

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.270 
which you know is fantastic achievement
for<00:02:26.959> their<00:02:27.140> and<00:02:27.319> I<00:02:27.500> think<00:02:27.770> South<00:02:27.920> African

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
for their and I think South African

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.520 
for their and I think South African
rugby<00:02:28.459> is<00:02:28.910> at<00:02:29.060> a<00:02:29.090> place<00:02:29.300> now<00:02:29.690> where<00:02:29.720> it's<00:02:30.019> where

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
rugby is at a place now where it's where

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.080 
rugby is at a place now where it's where
it's<00:02:30.680> never<00:02:30.830> really<00:02:31.100> been<00:02:31.250> been<00:02:31.850> before

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
it's never really been been before

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.030 
it's never really been been before
they're<00:02:32.540> the<00:02:33.110> real<00:02:33.350> force<00:02:33.709> to<00:02:33.920> be<00:02:34.010> reckoned

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
they're the real force to be reckoned

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.370 
they're the real force to be reckoned
with<00:02:34.459> so<00:02:34.850> but<00:02:35.300> I<00:02:35.330> think<00:02:35.750> at<00:02:35.840> the<00:02:35.930> same<00:02:36.140> time

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
with so but I think at the same time

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.690 
with so but I think at the same time
there's<00:02:36.620> enough<00:02:36.830> potential<00:02:37.190> in<00:02:37.430> the<00:02:37.519> in<00:02:37.670> the

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
there's enough potential in the in the

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.759 
there's enough potential in the in the
lion<00:02:37.970> squad<00:02:38.330> to<00:02:38.780> get<00:02:38.930> a<00:02:38.959> series<00:02:39.350> win<00:02:39.530> and

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
lion squad to get a series win and

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:41.350 
lion squad to get a series win and
confident<00:02:40.400> that<00:02:40.519> we<00:02:40.580> have<00:02:40.610> the<00:02:40.880> ability<00:02:41.330> to

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
confident that we have the ability to

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.809 
confident that we have the ability to
beat<00:02:41.750> them<00:02:41.959> but<00:02:42.140> you<00:02:42.709> know<00:02:42.800> the<00:02:43.040> lower

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
beat them but you know the lower

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:45.880 
beat them but you know the lower
depending<00:02:44.180> on<00:02:44.540> how<00:02:44.690> we<00:02:44.750> gel<00:02:45.110> is<00:02:45.260> it<00:02:45.410> as<00:02:45.530> a<00:02:45.560> team

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
depending on how we gel is it as a team

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.309 
depending on how we gel is it as a team
and<00:02:46.160> on<00:02:46.340> and<00:02:46.910> off<00:02:47.030> the<00:02:47.209> field<00:02:47.239> and<00:02:47.720> I<00:02:47.900> think<00:02:48.140> off

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 
and on and off the field and I think off

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:50.140 
and on and off the field and I think off
the<00:02:48.530> field<00:02:48.739> is<00:02:49.100> probably<00:02:49.430> as<00:02:49.550> important<00:02:50.030> as

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
the field is probably as important as

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.390 
the field is probably as important as
anything
