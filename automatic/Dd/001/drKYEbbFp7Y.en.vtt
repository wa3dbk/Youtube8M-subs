00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
there's probably I would say around ten

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.630 
there's probably I would say around ten
to<00:00:54.870> fifteen<00:00:55.170> orders<00:00:55.559> in<00:00:55.680> this<00:00:55.770> game<00:00:56.010> this<00:00:56.460> guy

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
to fifteen orders in this game this guy

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.160 
to fifteen orders in this game this guy
was<00:00:57.000> having<00:00:57.120> trouble<00:00:57.510> with<00:00:57.600> right<00:00:57.809> here<00:00:57.960> but

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
was having trouble with right here but

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.470 
was having trouble with right here but
one<00:00:58.320> of<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.440> hardest<00:00:58.680> ones<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.210> yeah<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.239> would

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
one of the hardest ones and yeah I would

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.779 
one of the hardest ones and yeah I would
say<00:01:00.629> first<00:01:00.930> honestly<00:01:01.469> if<00:01:01.710> you<00:01:01.949> can<00:01:02.190> crack<00:01:02.520> any

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
say first honestly if you can crack any

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.160 
say first honestly if you can crack any
molotovs<00:01:03.600> or<00:01:03.989> bombs<00:01:04.830> or<00:01:05.280> maybe<00:01:05.820> a<00:01:05.909> grenade<00:01:06.540> to

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
molotovs or bombs or maybe a grenade to

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.719 
molotovs or bombs or maybe a grenade to
slow<00:01:07.710> him<00:01:07.979> down<00:01:08.010> that's<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.369> best<00:01:08.580> thing<00:01:08.700> to

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
slow him down that's the best thing to

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.090 
slow him down that's the best thing to
do<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:09.180> would<00:01:10.080> really<00:01:10.290> think<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.619> Mull<00:01:10.860> tabs

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
do I would really think that Mull tabs

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.859 
do I would really think that Mull tabs
and<00:01:11.430> bombs<00:01:11.729> would<00:01:11.939> really<00:01:12.119> do<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.420> trick<00:01:12.450> seat

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
and bombs would really do the trick seat

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.289 
and bombs would really do the trick seat
and<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.409> would<00:01:13.560> say<00:01:13.740> run<00:01:14.040> away<00:01:14.369> try<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.000> stay<00:01:15.210> as

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
and I would say run away try to stay as

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.359 
and I would say run away try to stay as
far<00:01:15.600> away<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:16.170> separated<00:01:16.770> as<00:01:16.860> far<00:01:17.070> as<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.220> can

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
far away and separated as far as you can

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.120 
far away and separated as far as you can
from<00:01:17.670> him<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.720> you<00:01:18.780> don't<00:01:19.170> die<00:01:19.350> he<00:01:19.560> will<00:01:19.830> run

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
from him so you don't die he will run

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.800 
from him so you don't die he will run
out<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:20.400> just<00:01:20.520> try<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:20.820> run<00:01:21.090> around<00:01:21.180> him<00:01:21.630> and

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
out you just try to run around him and

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.719 
out you just try to run around him and
continue<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:22.740> would<00:01:22.979> say<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.220> shotgun

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
continue I would say the shotgun

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.340 
continue I would say the shotgun
probably<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.240> best<00:01:24.450> but<00:01:24.630> at<00:01:24.750> this<00:01:24.840> point<00:01:25.110> if

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
probably the best but at this point if

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.539 
probably the best but at this point if
you're<00:01:25.439> right<00:01:25.650> this<00:01:25.830> mission<00:01:26.220> or<00:01:26.280> any<00:01:26.430> other

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
you're right this mission or any other

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.550 
you're right this mission or any other
ones<00:01:26.790> shotguns<00:01:27.509> probably<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.869> best<00:01:28.080> or<00:01:28.320> maybe

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
ones shotguns probably the best or maybe

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.740 
ones shotguns probably the best or maybe
the<00:01:28.710> flamethrower<00:01:29.310> or<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.329> hunting<00:01:30.570> rifle

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
the flamethrower or the hunting rifle

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.630 
the flamethrower or the hunting rifle
it's<00:01:31.320> pretty<00:01:31.560> nice<00:01:31.710> as<00:01:31.890> well<00:01:32.070> I<00:01:32.280> would<00:01:32.549> say

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
it's pretty nice as well I would say

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.280 
it's pretty nice as well I would say
just<00:01:32.759> stay<00:01:32.970> away<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.420> continue<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:34.020> try<00:01:34.259> and

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
just stay away and continue to try and

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.050 
just stay away and continue to try and
shoot<00:01:34.680> him<00:01:34.829> in<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.009> head<00:01:35.130> that's<00:01:35.759> pretty

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
shoot him in the head that's pretty

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.300 
shoot him in the head that's pretty
