slinky<00:00:34.590> spring<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:35.340> that<00:00:36.120> catches<00:00:36.719> it<00:00:36.899> the

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
slinky spring and that catches it the

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.510 
slinky spring and that catches it the
drive<00:00:37.890> rod<00:00:38.280> here<00:00:38.760> connects<00:00:39.210> on<00:00:39.450> here<00:00:40.399> lifts<00:00:41.399> it

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
drive rod here connects on here lifts it

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.130 
drive rod here connects on here lifts it
up<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:41.850> down<00:00:42.379> when<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.500> drive<00:00:43.800> rod<00:00:44.100> is<00:00:44.340> down

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
up and down when the drive rod is down

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.860 
up and down when the drive rod is down
this<00:00:46.140> finger<00:00:46.710> on<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:46.980> drive<00:00:47.309> rod<00:00:47.750> catches<00:00:48.750> the

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
this finger on the drive rod catches the

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.060 
this finger on the drive rod catches the
end<00:00:49.020> of<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.200> slinky<00:00:49.500> spring<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:51.890> opens<00:00:52.890> up

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
end of the slinky spring and opens up

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.299 
end of the slinky spring and opens up
the<00:00:53.129> spring<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.969> that<00:00:54.090> allows<00:00:55.100> this<00:00:56.100> to

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
the spring and that allows this to

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.549 
the spring and that allows this to
freewheel<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.120> prop<00:00:57.390> doesn't<00:00:57.840> turn<00:00:58.079> so

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
freewheel and the prop doesn't turn so

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.979 
freewheel and the prop doesn't turn so
that's<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:59.010> way<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.309> works<00:00:59.600> this<00:01:00.600> particular

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
that's the way it works this particular

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.359 
that's the way it works this particular
one<00:01:01.500> this<00:01:01.829> casting<00:01:02.489> piece<00:01:02.789> broke<00:01:03.270> off<00:01:04.189> this<00:01:05.189> is

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
one this casting piece broke off this is

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.740 
one this casting piece broke off this is
part<00:01:05.670> number<00:01:06.950> 205<00:01:07.950> one<00:01:08.460> one<00:01:08.729> five<00:01:09.090> it's<00:01:09.479> rare

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
part number 205 one one five it's rare

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.469 
part number 205 one one five it's rare
as<00:01:09.930> hen's<00:01:09.960> teeth<00:01:10.380> but<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:10.950> did<00:01:11.189> get<00:01:11.430> one<00:01:11.670> put<00:01:12.390> it

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
as hen's teeth but I did get one put it

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.170 
as hen's teeth but I did get one put it
on<00:01:12.799> there's<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.890> little<00:01:14.159> goofy<00:01:14.490> spring<00:01:14.850> clip

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
on there's a little goofy spring clip

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.999 
on there's a little goofy spring clip
here<00:01:15.420> holds<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.049> fork<00:01:17.000> that<00:01:18.000> goes<00:01:18.240> down<00:01:19.009> this

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
here holds the fork that goes down this

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.940 
here holds the fork that goes down this
rod<00:01:21.500> goes<00:01:22.500> on<00:01:22.770> here<00:01:23.130> like<00:01:23.310> this<00:01:23.640> pushes<00:01:24.509> down

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
rod goes on here like this pushes down

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.420 
rod goes on here like this pushes down
and<00:01:25.950> engages<00:01:26.520> this<00:01:26.670> spring<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.570> put<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:27.900> into

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
and engages this spring to put it into

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:35.200 
and engages this spring to put it into
neutral<00:01:30.079> power<00:01:31.079> goes<00:01:31.470> on<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.829> end<00:01:32.009> putter<00:01:33.000> in
