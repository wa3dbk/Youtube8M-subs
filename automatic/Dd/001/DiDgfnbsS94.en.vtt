wasn't<00:01:41.970> really<00:01:42.180> for<00:01:42.329> my<00:01:42.420> skin<00:01:42.689> tone<00:01:42.840> but<00:01:43.049> after

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
wasn't really for my skin tone but after

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.469 
wasn't really for my skin tone but after
I<00:01:43.380> kind<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:43.710> got<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.430> hang<00:01:44.460> of<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.180> really

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
I kind of got the hang of it it really

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.780 
I kind of got the hang of it it really
worked<00:01:45.780> out<00:01:45.899> well<00:01:46.110> for<00:01:46.140> me<00:01:46.439> so<00:01:47.009> I<00:01:47.040> really<00:01:47.460> have

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
worked out well for me so I really have

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.240 
worked out well for me so I really have
enjoyed<00:01:47.820> using<00:01:48.540> it<00:01:48.869> so<00:01:49.380> when<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:49.770> was<00:01:50.009> browsing

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
enjoyed using it so when I was browsing

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.179 
enjoyed using it so when I was browsing
the<00:01:50.520> internet<00:01:51.000> Android<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.570> behold<00:01:51.899> I

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
the internet Android and behold I

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:56.179 
the internet Android and behold I
stumbled<00:01:53.189> upon<00:01:53.960> something<00:01:54.960> closer<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.799> that<00:01:55.979> I

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
stumbled upon something closer to that I

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.690 
stumbled upon something closer to that I
wanted<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.090> jump<00:01:57.329> on<00:01:57.509> it<00:01:57.659> so<00:01:58.200> um<00:01:58.530> let<00:01:59.340> me<00:01:59.490> tell

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
wanted to jump on it so um let me tell

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.899 
wanted to jump on it so um let me tell
you<00:01:59.909> a<00:01:59.939> little<00:02:00.210> bit<00:02:00.360> about<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:01.909> similarity

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
you a little bit about the similarity

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.810 
you a little bit about the similarity
that<00:02:03.000> they<00:02:03.180> have<00:02:03.390> reduce<00:02:04.430> will<00:02:05.430> do<00:02:05.579> a<00:02:05.610> little

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
that they have reduce will do a little

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.600 
that they have reduce will do a little
bit<00:02:05.939> of<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.030> comparison<00:02:06.390> so<00:02:06.869> first<00:02:07.170> this<00:02:08.039> is<00:02:08.369> I

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
bit of a comparison so first this is I

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.900 
bit of a comparison so first this is I

purchased this on makeup mania calm this
I<00:02:13.090> purchased<00:02:13.510> him<00:02:13.630> another<00:02:13.840> site<00:02:14.110> I<00:02:14.260> would

I purchased him another site I would

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.720 
I purchased him another site I would
have<00:02:14.590> it<00:02:14.710> down<00:02:14.830> below<00:02:15.130> which<00:02:15.370> sites<00:02:15.610> I

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
have it down below which sites I

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.900 
have it down below which sites I
purchase<00:02:16.150> these<00:02:16.330> from<00:02:16.680> but<00:02:17.680> this<00:02:18.340> one<00:02:18.670> I<00:02:18.880> think

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
purchase these from but this one I think

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
purchase these from but this one I think
cost<00:02:19.390> me<00:02:19.570> around<00:02:19.810> $10<00:02:20.520> and<00:02:21.520> with<00:02:22.390> shipping<00:02:22.690> and

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
cost me around $10 and with shipping and

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.860 
cost me around $10 and with shipping and
everything<00:02:23.440> maybe<00:02:23.620> came<00:02:23.920> up<00:02:24.070> to<00:02:24.220> about<00:02:24.400> 15<00:02:25.150> for

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
everything maybe came up to about 15 for

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.560 
everything maybe came up to about 15 for
this<00:02:26.050> one<00:02:26.320> I<00:02:26.650> want<00:02:27.250> to<00:02:27.340> say<00:02:27.520> maybe<00:02:28.270> a<00:02:28.390> little

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
this one I want to say maybe a little

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:31.470 
this one I want to say maybe a little
less<00:02:28.840> between<00:02:29.350> 13<00:02:29.950> and<00:02:29.980> 15<00:02:30.250> for<00:02:30.850> this<00:02:30.970> one<00:02:31.210> and

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
less between 13 and 15 for this one and

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.630 
less between 13 and 15 for this one and
then<00:02:31.990> the<00:02:32.320> graftobian<00:02:32.830> one<00:02:33.190> is<00:02:33.340> a<00:02:33.370> little<00:02:33.520> bit

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
then the graftobian one is a little bit

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.090 
then the graftobian one is a little bit
more<00:02:33.700> expensive<00:02:34.000> it<00:02:34.420> was<00:02:34.480> $22<00:02:35.320> and<00:02:35.620> with

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
more expensive it was $22 and with

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.980 
more expensive it was $22 and with
shipping<00:02:36.490> it<00:02:36.610> cost<00:02:36.790> me<00:02:36.970> about<00:02:37.030> 24<00:02:37.600> something

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990 
shipping it cost me about 24 something

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.990 
shipping it cost me about 24 something
so<00:02:38.500> in<00:02:38.800> this<00:02:39.010> one<00:02:39.220> you<00:02:39.370> get<00:02:39.490> it<00:02:39.610> in<00:02:39.700> a<00:02:39.760> little

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
so in this one you get it in a little

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.910 
so in this one you get it in a little
jar<00:02:40.210> like<00:02:40.420> this<00:02:40.480> and<00:02:40.990> unlike<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.620> banana

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
jar like this and unlike the banana

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.670 
jar like this and unlike the banana
powder<00:02:42.190> it<00:02:42.610> does<00:02:42.670> come<00:02:43.510> with<00:02:43.540> it's<00:02:44.260> a<00:02:44.410> bigger

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
powder it does come with it's a bigger

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.090 
powder it does come with it's a bigger
cylinder<00:02:45.370> and<00:02:45.960> it<00:02:46.960> does<00:02:47.170> come<00:02:47.410> with<00:02:47.440> a<00:02:47.560> sifter

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:48.100 
cylinder and it does come with a sifter

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.250 
cylinder and it does come with a sifter
which<00:02:48.610> is<00:02:48.760> easier<00:02:49.120> to<00:02:49.180> use<00:02:49.510> that's<00:02:49.930> one<00:02:50.110> of<00:02:50.200> the

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
which is easier to use that's one of the

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.960 
which is easier to use that's one of the
problems<00:02:50.680> and<00:02:50.950> issues<00:02:51.220> that<00:02:51.550> I<00:02:51.580> have<00:02:51.760> with<00:02:51.790> the

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
problems and issues that I have with the

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.260 
problems and issues that I have with the
banana<00:02:52.270> powder<00:02:52.480> is<00:02:52.780> that<00:02:53.820> the<00:02:54.820> way<00:02:54.970> that<00:02:55.120> they

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
banana powder is that the way that they

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.000 
banana powder is that the way that they
package<00:02:55.690> it<00:02:55.840> is<00:02:55.990> not<00:02:56.140> very<00:02:56.320> convenient<00:02:56.740> for

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:57.010 
package it is not very convenient for

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.260 
package it is not very convenient for
you<00:02:57.070> to<00:02:57.100> use<00:02:57.310> um<00:02:57.670> so<00:02:58.360> in<00:02:58.660> this<00:02:58.840> one<00:02:59.140> I<00:02:59.350> got<00:03:00.270> 0.7

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
you to use um so in this one I got 0.7

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.870 
you to use um so in this one I got 0.7
ounces<00:03:01.780> and<00:03:01.990> in<00:03:02.440> this<00:03:02.650> little<00:03:02.980> jar<00:03:03.010> of<00:03:03.340> the<00:03:03.700> Ben

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
ounces and in this little jar of the Ben

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.820 
ounces and in this little jar of the Ben
9<00:03:04.090> I<00:03:04.360> have<00:03:06.240> 1.5<00:03:07.240> ounces<00:03:07.660> which<00:03:08.140> is<00:03:08.170> odd<00:03:08.500> because

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
9 I have 1.5 ounces which is odd because

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.640 
9 I have 1.5 ounces which is odd because
this<00:03:09.280> seems<00:03:09.610> a<00:03:09.760> lot<00:03:09.940> bigger<00:03:10.180> than<00:03:10.300> this<00:03:10.630> but<00:03:11.380> it

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
this seems a lot bigger than this but it

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.020 
this seems a lot bigger than this but it
seems<00:03:11.860> like<00:03:12.070> this<00:03:12.280> little<00:03:12.640> jar<00:03:12.850> right<00:03:12.970> here

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
seems like this little jar right here

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.120 
seems like this little jar right here
has<00:03:13.330> more<00:03:13.600> product<00:03:14.020> than<00:03:14.080> this<00:03:14.380> one<00:03:14.680> as<00:03:14.950> I

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
has more product than this one as I

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.250 
has more product than this one as I
started<00:03:15.460> using<00:03:15.520> this<00:03:15.910> I<00:03:16.060> noticed<00:03:16.420> that<00:03:16.600> the

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
started using this I noticed that the

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.040 
started using this I noticed that the
consistency<00:03:18.010> is<00:03:18.190> almost<00:03:18.580> finer<00:03:19.090> than<00:03:19.900> the

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
consistency is almost finer than the

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.440 
consistency is almost finer than the
banana<00:03:20.290> powder<00:03:20.620> I<00:03:21.070> feel<00:03:21.700> like<00:03:21.880> way<00:03:22.090> as<00:03:22.300> the

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
banana powder I feel like way as the

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.210 
banana powder I feel like way as the
banana<00:03:22.750> powder<00:03:22.960> is<00:03:23.230> meant<00:03:23.530> more<00:03:23.710> for<00:03:23.740> stage

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
banana powder is meant more for stage

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.520 
banana powder is meant more for stage
makeup<00:03:24.520> this<00:03:25.120> is<00:03:25.180> more<00:03:25.540> meant<00:03:25.810> for<00:03:25.900> everyday

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
makeup this is more meant for everyday

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.460 
makeup this is more meant for everyday
use<00:03:26.950> and<00:03:27.340> this<00:03:28.030> almost<00:03:28.270> reminds<00:03:28.870> me<00:03:28.930> of<00:03:29.230> the

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:29.470 
use and this almost reminds me of the

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.400 
it's such a fine silky consistency when
you<00:03:35.410> apply<00:03:35.770> it<00:03:35.820> it<00:03:36.820> goes<00:03:37.150> on<00:03:37.360> very<00:03:37.810> smoothly

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
you apply it it goes on very smoothly

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.980 
you apply it it goes on very smoothly
it's<00:03:39.190> easier<00:03:39.820> to<00:03:40.060> blend<00:03:40.360> and<00:03:40.600> have<00:03:40.870> it

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:40.990 
it's easier to blend and have it

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.110 
it's easier to blend and have it
disappear<00:03:41.170> into<00:03:41.740> your<00:03:41.950> skin<00:03:42.370> when<00:03:42.580> you<00:03:42.700> use<00:03:42.730> it

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
disappear into your skin when you use it

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.230 
disappear into your skin when you use it
so<00:03:44.050> it's<00:03:44.290> a<00:03:44.440> really<00:03:44.680> really<00:03:44.950> nice<00:03:45.130> powder<00:03:45.520> okay

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:46.240 
so it's a really really nice powder okay

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.960 
so it's a really really nice powder okay
now<00:03:46.390> let's<00:03:47.020> get<00:03:47.200> down<00:03:47.380> to<00:03:47.680> the<00:03:47.940> question<00:03:48.940> that

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
now let's get down to the question that

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.460 
now let's get down to the question that
I'm<00:03:49.180> sure<00:03:49.210> all<00:03:49.600> you<00:03:49.810> guys<00:03:49.840> are<00:03:50.140> waiting<00:03:50.350> to

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
I'm sure all you guys are waiting to

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.830 
I'm sure all you guys are waiting to
hear<00:03:50.500> is<00:03:50.920> this<00:03:51.580> better<00:03:51.940> than<00:03:52.330> the<00:03:52.390> banana

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
hear is this better than the banana

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.960 
hear is this better than the banana
powder<00:03:53.110> I'm<00:03:53.860> not<00:03:54.100> gonna<00:03:54.280> say<00:03:54.490> it<00:03:54.640> so<00:03:54.820> much

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
powder I'm not gonna say it so much

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.330 
powder I'm not gonna say it so much
better<00:03:55.330> I<00:03:55.630> would<00:03:55.960> say<00:03:56.140> that<00:03:56.380> their<00:03:56.650> each<00:03:56.920> have

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
better I would say that their each have

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.190 
better I would say that their each have
their<00:03:57.520> own<00:03:57.580> things<00:03:58.240> that<00:03:58.600> they<00:03:58.810> do<00:03:58.870> better

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
their own things that they do better

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.040 
their own things that they do better
than<00:03:59.470> the<00:03:59.590> other<00:03:59.620> one<00:04:00.120> I<00:04:01.120> would<00:04:01.510> say<00:04:01.720> that<00:04:01.930> the

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.050 
than the other one I would say that the

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:03.600 
than the other one I would say that the
banana<00:04:02.380> powder<00:04:02.680> does<00:04:03.010> a<00:04:03.040> great<00:04:03.370> job<00:04:03.430> of

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
banana powder does a great job of

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.700 
banana powder does a great job of
highlighting<00:04:03.850> which<00:04:04.330> they<00:04:04.570> both<00:04:04.780> do<00:04:05.080> I<00:04:05.320> think

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:05.710 
highlighting which they both do I think

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.590 
highlighting which they both do I think
the<00:04:06.070> only<00:04:06.220> thing<00:04:06.340> that<00:04:06.490> the<00:04:06.760> graftobian<00:04:07.150> has

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
the only thing that the graftobian has

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.820 
the only thing that the graftobian has
over<00:04:08.050> the<00:04:08.080> banana<00:04:08.440> powder

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
over the banana powder

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.480 
over the banana powder
it's<00:04:09.010> how<00:04:09.250> silky<00:04:09.730> it<00:04:09.970> is<00:04:10.150> and<00:04:10.530> it's<00:04:11.530> also<00:04:11.770> in<00:04:12.010> HD

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:12.490 
it's how silky it is and it's also in HD

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.190 
it's how silky it is and it's also in HD
powder<00:04:12.820> I<00:04:13.180> think<00:04:13.420> another<00:04:13.690> thing<00:04:13.810> that<00:04:13.990> the

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
powder I think another thing that the

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.080 
powder I think another thing that the
graftobian<00:04:14.560> has<00:04:15.070> that<00:04:15.520> I<00:04:15.550> really<00:04:15.970> do

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
graftobian has that I really do

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.070 
graftobian has that I really do
appreciate<00:04:16.330> its<00:04:16.750> the<00:04:16.900> fact<00:04:17.109> that<00:04:17.230> it<00:04:17.830> almost

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080 
appreciate its the fact that it almost

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:23.460 
appreciate its the fact that it almost
is<00:04:20.430> color<00:04:21.430> changing<00:04:22.060> depending<00:04:22.270> on<00:04:22.930> your<00:04:23.140> skin

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
is color changing depending on your skin

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.490 
is color changing depending on your skin
tone<00:04:23.680> depending<00:04:24.460> on<00:04:24.970> the

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
tone depending on the

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.190 
tone depending on the
that<00:04:25.740> you<00:04:25.890> have<00:04:26.040> on<00:04:26.280> I've<00:04:26.790> tried<00:04:27.330> it<00:04:27.510> with<00:04:27.540> one

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
that you have on I've tried it with one

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.280 
that you have on I've tried it with one
of<00:04:28.320> my<00:04:28.440> darker<00:04:28.860> concealers<00:04:29.430> which<00:04:29.790> I<00:04:30.690> have<00:04:31.050> one

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
of my darker concealers which I have one

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.430 
of my darker concealers which I have one
by<00:04:31.440> Iman<00:04:31.770> and<00:04:32.100> it<00:04:32.880> almost<00:04:33.180> it<00:04:33.720> matches<00:04:34.260> me

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
by Iman and it almost it matches me

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.740 
by Iman and it almost it matches me
perfectly<00:04:34.470> and<00:04:35.340> it<00:04:35.880> just<00:04:36.090> picks<00:04:36.420> up<00:04:36.600> the

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
perfectly and it just picks up the

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.840 
perfectly and it just picks up the
undertone<00:04:37.230> of<00:04:37.260> the<00:04:37.500> concealer<00:04:37.920> perfectly<00:04:38.580> and

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
undertone of the concealer perfectly and

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:40.850 
undertone of the concealer perfectly and
then<00:04:39.180> I've<00:04:39.330> also<00:04:39.540> tried<00:04:39.930> it<00:04:40.110> with<00:04:40.290> my<00:04:40.470> lighter

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
then I've also tried it with my lighter

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.840 
then I've also tried it with my lighter
and<00:04:41.040> c42<00:04:41.960> Mac<00:04:42.960> concealers<00:04:43.590> and<00:04:43.830> he<00:04:44.280> picks<00:04:44.640> up

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
and c42 Mac concealers and he picks up

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.880 
and c42 Mac concealers and he picks up
the<00:04:45.120> tone<00:04:45.360> in<00:04:45.570> that<00:04:45.750> one<00:04:45.990> perfectly<00:04:46.620> now<00:04:46.800> if

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:46.890 
the tone in that one perfectly now if

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:48.740 
the tone in that one perfectly now if
you<00:04:47.040> are<00:04:47.160> darker<00:04:47.610> skin<00:04:47.880> tone<00:04:48.090> than<00:04:48.300> me<00:04:48.510> and

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
you are darker skin tone than me and

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.960 
you are darker skin tone than me and
you're<00:04:49.650> the<00:04:49.830> banana<00:04:50.100> powder<00:04:50.340> just<00:04:50.580> wasn't

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
you're the banana powder just wasn't

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.190 
you're the banana powder just wasn't
working<00:04:51.240> for<00:04:51.270> you<00:04:51.480> this<00:04:51.630> is<00:04:51.780> probably<00:04:51.930> your

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
working for you this is probably your

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.160 
working for you this is probably your
best<00:04:52.410> bet<00:04:52.590> because<00:04:52.980> it<00:04:53.310> doesn't<00:04:53.730> stand<00:04:54.570> a<00:04:54.840> very

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.170 
best bet because it doesn't stand a very

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.170 
best bet because it doesn't stand a very
stark<00:04:55.590> against<00:04:55.920> the<00:04:56.070> skin<00:04:56.310> it<00:04:56.550> kind<00:04:56.760> of<00:04:56.820> blends

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
stark against the skin it kind of blends

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.730 
stark against the skin it kind of blends
in<00:04:57.360> with<00:04:57.450> the<00:04:57.570> products<00:04:57.930> you<00:04:58.050> really<00:04:58.260> have<00:04:58.470> and

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
in with the products you really have and

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.950 
in with the products you really have and
it<00:04:59.190> mimics<00:04:59.430> the<00:04:59.700> undertone<00:05:00.240> of<00:05:00.450> the<00:05:00.540> product

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
it mimics the undertone of the product

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.260 
it mimics the undertone of the product
you<00:05:01.050> apply<00:05:01.440> it<00:05:01.500> on<00:05:01.770> top<00:05:02.040> of<00:05:02.250> but<00:05:02.880> I<00:05:02.910> really

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
you apply it on top of but I really

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:04.909 
you apply it on top of but I really
definitely<00:05:03.450> think<00:05:03.870> that<00:05:04.020> the<00:05:04.230> the<00:05:04.470> graftobian

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 
definitely think that the the graftobian

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:06.920 
definitely think that the the graftobian
powder<00:05:05.370> if<00:05:05.610> you<00:05:05.640> know<00:05:05.970> how<00:05:06.120> to<00:05:06.180> apply<00:05:06.450> it<00:05:06.600> which

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
powder if you know how to apply it which

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.140 
powder if you know how to apply it which
you<00:05:07.350> should<00:05:07.500> always<00:05:07.650> apply<00:05:07.950> lightly<00:05:08.550> and<00:05:08.760> use

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
you should always apply lightly and use

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.760 
you should always apply lightly and use
a<00:05:09.180> sponge<00:05:09.600> and<00:05:09.870> really<00:05:10.080> push<00:05:10.320> it<00:05:10.350> into<00:05:10.590> the

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
a sponge and really push it into the

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.430 
a sponge and really push it into the
skin<00:05:11.130> and<00:05:11.340> blend<00:05:11.880> it<00:05:12.060> out<00:05:12.180> evenly<00:05:12.660> it<00:05:12.990> should

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440 
skin and blend it out evenly it should

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.680 
skin and blend it out evenly it should
work<00:05:13.650> for<00:05:13.950> almost<00:05:14.220> I'm<00:05:14.940> not<00:05:15.150> gonna<00:05:15.270> say<00:05:15.510> I've

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
work for almost I'm not gonna say I've

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.630 
work for almost I'm not gonna say I've
apply<00:05:15.990> it<00:05:16.050> on<00:05:16.200> the<00:05:16.290> deepest<00:05:16.740> deepest<00:05:17.190> skintone

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:17.640 
apply it on the deepest deepest skintone

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.340 
apply it on the deepest deepest skintone
but<00:05:17.850> I<00:05:18.150> believe<00:05:18.510> this<00:05:18.660> could<00:05:18.840> work<00:05:19.020> for<00:05:19.169> almost

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:19.350 
but I believe this could work for almost

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.500 
but I believe this could work for almost
any<00:05:19.710> skin<00:05:20.070> tone<00:05:20.310> if<00:05:20.580> it<00:05:20.790> doesn't<00:05:21.120> work<00:05:21.210> for<00:05:21.240> you

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 
any skin tone if it doesn't work for you

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.870 
any skin tone if it doesn't work for you
you<00:05:21.660> don't<00:05:21.810> company<00:05:22.320> but<00:05:22.560> now<00:05:23.070> let's<00:05:23.520> go<00:05:23.820> to

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
you don't company but now let's go to

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.820 
you don't company but now let's go to
the<00:05:24.330> downside<00:05:24.810> of<00:05:24.840> it<00:05:25.110> the<00:05:25.320> one<00:05:25.500> thing<00:05:25.680> that

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
the downside of it the one thing that

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:27.350 
the downside of it the one thing that
I've<00:05:25.919> noticed<00:05:25.950> that<00:05:26.460> I<00:05:26.520> do<00:05:26.610> not<00:05:26.910> really<00:05:27.240> like

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
I've noticed that I do not really like

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.870 
I've noticed that I do not really like
about<00:05:27.750> the<00:05:28.020> graftobian<00:05:28.380> powder<00:05:28.919> is<00:05:29.550> that<00:05:29.850> I

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
about the graftobian powder is that I

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.240 
about the graftobian powder is that I
feel<00:05:30.360> that<00:05:30.419> it<00:05:31.169> has<00:05:31.380> a<00:05:31.410> bit<00:05:31.680> of<00:05:31.860> a<00:05:31.950> flashback

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
feel that it has a bit of a flashback

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.180 
feel that it has a bit of a flashback
now<00:05:32.940> I<00:05:32.970> will<00:05:33.450> try<00:05:34.020> to<00:05:34.050> take<00:05:34.290> some<00:05:34.470> pictures<00:05:34.860> and

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
now I will try to take some pictures and

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.730 
now I will try to take some pictures and
I<00:05:36.090> would<00:05:36.600> turn<00:05:36.810> off<00:05:36.930> all<00:05:37.080> the<00:05:37.169> lights<00:05:37.380> in<00:05:37.530> here

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
I would turn off all the lights in here

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:38.390 
I would turn off all the lights in here
in<00:05:37.919> a<00:05:37.979> minute

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
in a minute

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.980 
in a minute
take<00:05:38.729> some<00:05:38.880> pictures<00:05:39.210> and<00:05:39.240> I<00:05:39.450> insert<00:05:39.750> them<00:05:39.900> in

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
take some pictures and I insert them in

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.900 
take some pictures and I insert them in
here<00:05:40.229> so<00:05:40.680> you<00:05:40.740> guys<00:05:41.010> can<00:05:41.070> see<00:05:41.430> and<00:05:41.610> also<00:05:41.729> it

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:41.910 
here so you guys can see and also it

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:43.670 
here so you guys can see and also it
would<00:05:42.000> be<00:05:42.090> a<00:05:42.120> test<00:05:42.450> because<00:05:42.900> I<00:05:43.140> took<00:05:43.470> a<00:05:43.560> couple

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
would be a test because I took a couple

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.409 
would be a test because I took a couple
of<00:05:43.830> pictures<00:05:44.010> with<00:05:44.310> my<00:05:44.430> camera<00:05:44.630> with<00:05:45.630> my<00:05:45.870> arm

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:47.419 
of pictures with my camera with my arm

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:49.940 
of pictures with my camera with my arm
with<00:05:48.419> my<00:05:48.450> cell<00:05:48.780> phone<00:05:48.960> camera<00:05:48.990> and<00:05:49.470> I<00:05:49.770> saw<00:05:49.919> a

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:49.950 
with my cell phone camera and I saw a

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:52.040 
with my cell phone camera and I saw a
bit<00:05:50.190> of<00:05:50.280> a<00:05:50.370> flashback<00:05:50.610> but<00:05:50.970> I<00:05:51.090> can<00:05:51.479> tend<00:05:51.900> to<00:05:51.960> be

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050 
bit of a flashback but I can tend to be

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:53.659 
bit of a flashback but I can tend to be
a<00:05:52.140> little<00:05:52.350> heavy-handed<00:05:52.830> when<00:05:53.280> it<00:05:53.370> comes<00:05:53.550> to

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:53.669 
a little heavy-handed when it comes to

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:55.580 
a little heavy-handed when it comes to
powders<00:05:54.060> so<00:05:54.630> I<00:05:54.690> applied<00:05:55.110> it<00:05:55.229> a<00:05:55.290> little<00:05:55.470> bit

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590 
powders so I applied it a little bit

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.440 
powders so I applied it a little bit
less<00:05:55.830> today<00:05:56.130> and<00:05:56.520> we'll<00:05:56.729> see<00:05:56.910> how<00:05:57.060> that<00:05:57.120> works

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:57.450 
less today and we'll see how that works

00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:01.670 
less today and we'll see how that works
out<00:05:57.630> so<00:05:57.990> it<00:05:58.140> is<00:05:58.169> very<00:05:58.620> much<00:05:59.160> like<00:05:59.970> the<00:06:00.680> HD

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 
out so it is very much like the HD

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.740 
out so it is very much like the HD
powders<00:06:02.160> if<00:06:02.430> you<00:06:02.550> apply<00:06:02.880> too<00:06:02.940> much<00:06:03.150> of<00:06:03.450> it<00:06:03.570> you

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:03.750 
powders if you apply too much of it you

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.080 
powders if you apply too much of it you
do<00:06:03.960> get<00:06:04.200> a<00:06:04.229> flashback<00:06:04.590> it's<00:06:05.580> an<00:06:05.640> amazing
