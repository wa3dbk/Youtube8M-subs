00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
and before I finish I will take another

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.780 
and before I finish I will take another
jump<00:02:40.750> ring<00:02:40.900> that<00:02:41.709> I<00:02:41.739> know<00:02:41.860> is<00:02:42.340> almost

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
jump ring that I know is almost

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.970 
jump ring that I know is almost
completely<00:02:43.269> closed<00:02:43.659> and<00:02:44.590> i'm<00:02:44.769> going<00:02:44.890> to

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
completely closed and i'm going to

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:48.539 
completely closed and i'm going to
thread<00:02:45.280> it<00:02:45.310> on<00:02:45.610> there<00:02:46.950> then<00:02:47.950> I'll<00:02:48.099> close<00:02:48.370> the

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
thread it on there then I'll close the

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:55.170 
thread it on there then I'll close the
jump<00:02:48.760> ring<00:02:48.879> and<00:02:52.799> this<00:02:53.799> just<00:02:54.129> helps<00:02:54.370> to<00:02:54.700> keep<00:02:55.000> it

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
jump ring and this just helps to keep it

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.599 
jump ring and this just helps to keep it
together<00:02:55.390> at<00:02:55.930> the<00:02:56.500> top<00:02:56.709> as<00:02:57.010> you're<00:02:57.459> working

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:57.609 
together at the top as you're working

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:00.599 
together at the top as you're working
and<00:02:58.560> then<00:02:59.560> I'm<00:02:59.680> just<00:02:59.859> going<00:03:00.069> to<00:03:00.129> make<00:03:00.280> sure

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:00.609 
and then I'm just going to make sure

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:02.399 
and then I'm just going to make sure
that<00:03:00.939> the<00:03:01.060> other<00:03:01.239> jump<00:03:01.540> ring<00:03:01.720> that<00:03:01.870> I<00:03:01.900> added<00:03:02.140> is

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:02.409 
that the other jump ring that I added is

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:04.920 
that the other jump ring that I added is
completely<00:03:02.920> closed<00:03:03.420> and<00:03:04.420> then<00:03:04.659> I'm<00:03:04.780> going<00:03:04.870> to

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
completely closed and then I'm going to

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.660 
completely closed and then I'm going to
go<00:03:05.079> ahead<00:03:05.140> and<00:03:05.590> attach<00:03:05.859> it<00:03:05.890> to<00:03:06.099> my<00:03:06.220> ear<00:03:06.519> hook

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
go ahead and attach it to my ear hook

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.729 
go ahead and attach it to my ear hook
the<00:03:09.670> I<00:03:09.909> like<00:03:10.329> to<00:03:10.510> add<00:03:10.629> embellishments<00:03:10.870> to

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
the I like to add embellishments to

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.399 
the I like to add embellishments to
these<00:03:12.099> kidney<00:03:12.730> ear<00:03:12.909> wires<00:03:13.209> the<00:03:13.959> only<00:03:14.170> problem

00:03:14.399 --> 00:03:14.409 
these kidney ear wires the only problem

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:16.559 
these kidney ear wires the only problem
when<00:03:14.709> you<00:03:14.889> use<00:03:15.069> the<00:03:15.280> vintage<00:03:15.730> ear<00:03:16.060> wire<00:03:16.329> pieces

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
when you use the vintage ear wire pieces

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:19.050 
when you use the vintage ear wire pieces
it's<00:03:17.349> a<00:03:17.379> little<00:03:17.620> bit<00:03:17.709> softer<00:03:17.950> of<00:03:18.310> a<00:03:18.400> metal<00:03:18.730> so

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
it's a little bit softer of a metal so

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.449 
it's a little bit softer of a metal so
you<00:03:19.150> can't<00:03:19.540> really<00:03:19.690> thread<00:03:20.440> anything<00:03:21.040> over

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
you can't really thread anything over

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.259 
you can't really thread anything over
unless<00:03:21.760> it<00:03:22.720> has<00:03:23.019> a<00:03:23.049> bigger<00:03:23.799> size<00:03:24.159> hole<00:03:24.579> so

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
unless it has a bigger size hole so

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:26.940 
unless it has a bigger size hole so
that's<00:03:25.480> the<00:03:25.659> only<00:03:25.720> thing<00:03:26.260> you<00:03:26.470> have<00:03:26.650> to<00:03:26.680> deal

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
that's the only thing you have to deal

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.199 
that's the only thing you have to deal
with<00:03:27.129> there<00:03:27.430> but<00:03:28.299> once<00:03:29.049> i<00:03:29.260> get<00:03:29.500> my<00:03:30.209> filigree

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
with there but once i get my filigree

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:34.680 
with there but once i get my filigree
piece<00:03:31.510> on<00:03:31.780> here<00:03:32.170> i'm<00:03:32.859> gonna<00:03:33.069> take<00:03:33.430> and<00:03:33.879> i'm
