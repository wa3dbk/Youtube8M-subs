00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.210 

there<00:00:01.110> is<00:00:01.230> one<00:00:01.439> more<00:00:01.560> thing<00:00:01.620> that<00:00:01.890> you<00:00:01.979> can<00:00:02.070> do

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
there is one more thing that you can do

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.160 
there is one more thing that you can do
with<00:00:02.370> this<00:00:02.460> two<00:00:02.700> point<00:00:02.879> tracking<00:00:03.240> and<00:00:03.600> that<00:00:04.049> is

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
with this two point tracking and that is

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.970 
with this two point tracking and that is
a<00:00:04.380> rather<00:00:04.560> cheap<00:00:04.890> way<00:00:05.100> of<00:00:05.130> to<00:00:05.700> destabilization

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:06.980 
a rather cheap way of to destabilization

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.379 
a rather cheap way of to destabilization
for<00:00:07.980> example<00:00:08.340> if<00:00:08.460> you<00:00:08.580> have<00:00:08.610> very<00:00:08.849> shaky

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
for example if you have very shaky

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.720 
for example if you have very shaky
footage<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:10.200> camera<00:00:10.530> is<00:00:10.769> rotating<00:00:11.519> and

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
footage the camera is rotating and

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.669 
footage the camera is rotating and
deterring<00:00:12.120> a<00:00:12.240> lot<00:00:12.389> then<00:00:12.960> you<00:00:13.080> might<00:00:13.259> want<00:00:13.530> to

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
deterring a lot then you might want to

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.340 
deterring a lot then you might want to
stabilize<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.340> footage<00:00:14.849> and<00:00:15.509> in<00:00:15.990> that<00:00:16.109> case

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
stabilize the footage and in that case

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.380 
stabilize the footage and in that case
you<00:00:16.680> can<00:00:16.800> make<00:00:16.920> use<00:00:17.100> of<00:00:17.130> two<00:00:17.430> markers<00:00:17.789> just

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
you can make use of two markers just

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.500 
you can make use of two markers just
like<00:00:18.600> these<00:00:19.039> so<00:00:20.039> you<00:00:20.580> have<00:00:20.760> already<00:00:20.970> seen<00:00:21.240> that

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
like these so you have already seen that

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.220 
like these so you have already seen that
you<00:00:21.960> can<00:00:22.170> have<00:00:22.430> like<00:00:23.430> viewport<00:00:24.390> stabilization

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
you can have like viewport stabilization

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.730 
you can have like viewport stabilization
by<00:00:26.039> enabling<00:00:26.430> lock<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.570> selection<00:00:28.230> or<00:00:28.439> just

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
by enabling lock to selection or just

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.420 
by enabling lock to selection or just
press<00:00:28.980> L<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.599> by<00:00:30.599> hitting<00:00:30.720> odd<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.199> this<00:00:32.040> point

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
press L and by hitting odd a this point

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.430 
press L and by hitting odd a this point
will<00:00:32.669> now<00:00:32.790> be<00:00:33.030> perfectly<00:00:33.510> stable<00:00:33.870> here<00:00:34.200> in<00:00:34.320> the

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
will now be perfectly stable here in the

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.650 
will now be perfectly stable here in the
center<00:00:34.739> of<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.980> footage<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.660> footage

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
center of the footage and the footage

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.380 
center of the footage and the footage
will<00:00:36.809> be<00:00:36.899> just<00:00:37.140> moving<00:00:37.559> around<00:00:38.120> but<00:00:39.120> this<00:00:39.270> is

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
will be just moving around but this is

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.110 
will be just moving around but this is
really<00:00:39.570> just<00:00:39.870> for<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.710> viewport<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.399> will

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
really just for the viewport and will

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.850 
really just for the viewport and will
not<00:00:42.270> have<00:00:42.329> any<00:00:42.690> influence<00:00:42.989> on<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.590> footage

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
not have any influence on the footage

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.369 
not have any influence on the footage
itself<00:00:44.190> or<00:00:44.399> in<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.329> composite<00:00:45.750> or<00:00:46.050> a<00:00:46.110> video

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
itself or in the composite or a video

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.740 
itself or in the composite or a video
whatever<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:47.610> that<00:00:47.969> is<00:00:48.090> really<00:00:48.120> just<00:00:48.570> an

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
whatever so that is really just an

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.170 
whatever so that is really just an
option<00:00:48.930> here<00:00:49.350> for<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.890> display<00:00:50.309> in<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.820> movie

option here for the display in the movie
clip<00:00:51.360> editor<00:00:52.460> so<00:00:53.460> we<00:00:53.640> cannot<00:00:53.879> use<00:00:54.090> that<00:00:54.390> if<00:00:54.690> you

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
clip editor so we cannot use that if you

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.139 
clip editor so we cannot use that if you
want<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.230> stabilize<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.770> footage<00:00:56.250> so<00:00:56.760> let's

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
want to stabilize the footage so let's

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.049 
want to stabilize the footage so let's
disable<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:57.899> again<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.550> instead<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.879> have<00:01:00.030> to

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
disable it again and instead you have to

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.130 
disable it again and instead you have to
go<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:01.039> reconstruction<00:01:02.039> mode<00:01:02.600> so<00:01:03.600> here<00:01:03.960> in

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
go to the reconstruction mode so here in

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.640 
go to the reconstruction mode so here in
reconstruction<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.909> can<00:01:06.150> enable<00:01:06.450> over<00:01:07.260> here

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
reconstruction you can enable over here

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.550 
reconstruction you can enable over here
to<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.360> stabilization<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.510> when<00:01:10.290> you<00:01:10.380> do

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
to the stabilization and when you do

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.830 
to the stabilization and when you do
that<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.130> let's<00:01:11.670> expand<00:01:12.210> this<00:01:12.270> panel<00:01:12.689> too

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
that and let's expand this panel too

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.249 
that and let's expand this panel too
then<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:13.770> can<00:01:13.979> add<00:01:14.250> this<00:01:14.760> marker<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:16.229> the

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
then you can add this marker to the

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:17.840 
then you can add this marker to the
stabilization<00:01:17.070> by<00:01:17.189> hitting<00:01:17.430> this<00:01:17.549> little

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
stabilization by hitting this little

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.600 
stabilization by hitting this little
plus<00:01:18.000> sign<00:01:18.060> here<00:01:18.530> so<00:01:19.530> now<00:01:19.680> this<00:01:19.920> marker<00:01:20.369> will

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
plus sign here so now this marker will

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.149 
plus sign here so now this marker will
be<00:01:20.729> used<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.180> stabilize<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.930> footage<00:01:22.229> but<00:01:23.040> if

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
be used to stabilize the footage but if

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.280 
be used to stabilize the footage but if
you<00:01:23.250> know<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.490> all<00:01:23.640> eh<00:01:23.820> nothing<00:01:24.720> seems<00:01:25.200> to

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
you know it all eh nothing seems to

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.350 
you know it all eh nothing seems to
happen<00:01:25.560> but<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.490> is<00:01:26.729> because<00:01:26.880> the

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
happen but that is because the

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.030 
happen but that is because the
stabilization<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.409> happening<00:01:28.860> in<00:01:28.979> the

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
stabilization is happening in the

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.120 
stabilization is happening in the
background<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:29.939> cannot<00:01:30.210> see<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:30.600> yet<00:01:31.130> so

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
background and you cannot see it yet so

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.090 
background and you cannot see it yet so
to<00:01:32.189> see<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.090> stabilization<00:01:33.869> here<00:01:34.740> in<00:01:34.920> the

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
to see the stabilization here in the

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.190 
to see the stabilization here in the
reconstruction<00:01:35.369> mode<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.720> have<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.990> go<00:01:37.140> to

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
reconstruction mode you have to go to

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.499 
reconstruction mode you have to go to
the<00:01:37.530> display<00:01:38.250> panel<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:39.750> neighbor<00:01:40.159> stable

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
the display panel and a neighbor stable

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:44.389 
the display panel and a neighbor stable
now<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.570> have<00:01:42.899> this<00:01:43.079> dashed<00:01:43.500> outline<00:01:43.829> around

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
now you have this dashed outline around

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.139 
now you have this dashed outline around
the<00:01:44.640> footage<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.270> if<00:01:46.170> i<00:01:46.380> hit<00:01:46.500> alt<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:47.000> then<00:01:48.000> you

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
the footage and if i hit alt a then you

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.969 
the footage and if i hit alt a then you
can<00:01:48.299> see<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:48.630> now<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.110> footage<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.710> again

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
can see that now the footage is again

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.340 
can see that now the footage is again
moving<00:01:50.310> around<00:01:50.670> just<00:01:51.060> like<00:01:51.210> before<00:01:51.450> with<00:01:51.990> lock

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
moving around just like before with lock

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.280 
moving around just like before with lock
to<00:01:52.500> selection<00:01:53.299> but<00:01:54.299> this<00:01:54.420> can<00:01:54.630> now<00:01:54.750> also<00:01:54.990> be

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
to selection but this can now also be

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.550 
to selection but this can now also be
used<00:01:55.560> for<00:01:55.680> rendering<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.850> compositing<00:01:57.560> so

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
used for rendering and compositing so

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.499 
used for rendering and compositing so
this<00:01:58.740> is<00:01:58.890> now<00:01:59.040> perfectly<00:01:59.549> stable<00:01:59.880> here<00:02:00.329> right

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
this is now perfectly stable here right

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.149 
this is now perfectly stable here right
in<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.780> center<00:02:01.079> of<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.200> footage<00:02:01.590> but<00:02:01.979> that's

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
in the center of the footage but that's

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.639 
in the center of the footage but that's
maybe<00:02:02.369> not<00:02:02.490> what<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:02.969> want<00:02:03.200> so<00:02:04.200> in<00:02:04.320> that<00:02:04.439> case

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
maybe not what you want so in that case

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.160 
maybe not what you want so in that case
you<00:02:05.009> can<00:02:05.219> lower<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.939> influence<00:02:06.450> so<00:02:07.020> that

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
you can lower the influence so that

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.359 
you can lower the influence so that
there<00:02:07.320> is<00:02:07.409> just<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.829> little<00:02:08.039> bit<00:02:08.250> of

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
there is just a little bit of

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.360 
there is just a little bit of
stabilization<00:02:08.750> maybe<00:02:09.750> like<00:02:10.140> twenty<00:02:10.979> percent

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
stabilization maybe like twenty percent

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.840 
stabilization maybe like twenty percent
or<00:02:11.730> ten<00:02:12.000> percent<00:02:12.390> or<00:02:12.540> so

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
or ten percent or so

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.630 
or ten percent or so
so<00:02:14.850> the<00:02:15.090> footage<00:02:15.360> will<00:02:15.600> try<00:02:16.440> to<00:02:16.500> stick<00:02:17.400> to<00:02:17.430> this

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
so the footage will try to stick to this

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.950 
so the footage will try to stick to this
position<00:02:17.910> but<00:02:18.600> not<00:02:18.870> as<00:02:19.140> much<00:02:19.530> as<00:02:19.590> before<00:02:20.960> of

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
position but not as much as before of

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.930 
position but not as much as before of
course<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.410> problem<00:02:22.800> is<00:02:22.980> that<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:23.550> get<00:02:23.700> this

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
course the problem is that you get this

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.120 
course the problem is that you get this
black<00:02:24.210> borders<00:02:24.690> here<00:02:25.080> and<00:02:25.230> there<00:02:25.680> is<00:02:25.800> nothing

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
black borders here and there is nothing

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.650 
black borders here and there is nothing
that<00:02:26.310> you<00:02:26.490> want<00:02:26.580> to<00:02:26.730> have<00:02:26.910> in<00:02:27.060> your<00:02:27.090> final

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
that you want to have in your final

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.560 
that you want to have in your final
render<00:02:28.110> so<00:02:28.860> in<00:02:29.130> that<00:02:29.220> case<00:02:29.460> you<00:02:29.760> can<00:02:30.030> scale<00:02:30.420> the

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
render so in that case you can scale the

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.390 
render so in that case you can scale the
footage<00:02:30.900> so<00:02:31.290> that<00:02:31.440> you<00:02:31.530> don't<00:02:31.740> see<00:02:32.010> this<00:02:32.160> black

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
footage so that you don't see this black

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.810 
footage so that you don't see this black
border<00:02:32.790> and<00:02:33.650> to<00:02:34.650> do<00:02:34.800> that<00:02:34.980> you<00:02:35.220> can<00:02:35.550> enable

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
border and to do that you can enable

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.230 
border and to do that you can enable
here<00:02:36.300> Auto<00:02:36.540> scale<00:02:37.080> and<00:02:37.440> that<00:02:38.160> will<00:02:38.400> scale<00:02:39.090> the

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
here Auto scale and that will scale the

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.540 
here Auto scale and that will scale the
footage<00:02:39.600> so<00:02:40.170> that<00:02:40.380> you<00:02:40.500> don't<00:02:40.740> have<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.340> black

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
footage so that you don't have the black

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.290 
footage so that you don't have the black
border<00:02:41.970> and<00:02:43.040> in<00:02:44.040> case<00:02:44.250> that<00:02:44.580> it's<00:02:44.730> guides<00:02:45.000> too

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
border and in case that it's guides too

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.170 
border and in case that it's guides too
much<00:02:45.540> then<00:02:46.380> you<00:02:46.530> can<00:02:46.800> lower<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.610> maximum

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
much then you can lower the maximum

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.250 
much then you can lower the maximum
scale<00:02:49.790> so<00:02:50.790> when<00:02:51.180> you<00:02:51.270> lower<00:02:51.480> this<00:02:51.750> value<00:02:52.230> here

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
scale so when you lower this value here

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.840 
scale so when you lower this value here
and<00:02:53.930> you<00:02:54.930> can<00:02:55.200> precisely<00:02:55.739> scale<00:02:56.370> that<00:02:56.670> by

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
and you can precisely scale that by

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.820 
and you can precisely scale that by
holding<00:02:57.030> down<00:02:57.209> the<00:02:57.720> shift<00:02:58.080> key<00:02:58.290> while

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
holding down the shift key while

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.030 
holding down the shift key while
dragging<00:02:59.130> the<00:02:59.730> slider<00:03:00.530> so<00:03:01.530> when<00:03:01.680> you<00:03:01.770> turn

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
dragging the slider so when you turn

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.910 
dragging the slider so when you turn
this<00:03:02.190> down<00:03:02.430> then<00:03:03.150> you<00:03:03.300> can<00:03:03.570> lower<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:04.410> maximum

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
this down then you can lower the maximum

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.990 
this down then you can lower the maximum
scale<00:03:05.450> just<00:03:06.450> so<00:03:06.720> that<00:03:06.959> it<00:03:07.110> doesn't<00:03:07.440> get<00:03:08.000> black

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
scale just so that it doesn't get black

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.690 
scale just so that it doesn't get black
here<00:03:09.390> at<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:09.660> bottom<00:03:09.959> so<00:03:10.190> in<00:03:11.190> this<00:03:11.310> case<00:03:11.520> I

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
here at the bottom so in this case I

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.090 
here at the bottom so in this case I
think<00:03:11.730> that<00:03:12.480> value<00:03:12.840> should<00:03:12.900> be<00:03:13.050> enough<00:03:13.470> so

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
think that value should be enough so

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.430 
think that value should be enough so
that<00:03:14.370> is<00:03:14.610> one<00:03:14.790> way<00:03:15.000> you<00:03:15.030> can<00:03:15.390> do<00:03:15.720> position

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
that is one way you can do position

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.530 
that is one way you can do position
stabilization<00:03:17.100> now<00:03:18.000> of<00:03:18.090> course<00:03:18.150> you<00:03:18.390> don't

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
stabilization now of course you don't

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.060 
stabilization now of course you don't
want<00:03:18.840> to<00:03:18.900> take<00:03:19.110> away<00:03:19.260> too<00:03:19.380> much<00:03:19.739> of<00:03:19.950> your

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
want to take away too much of your

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.699 
want to take away too much of your
footage<00:03:20.310> so<00:03:21.000> twenty<00:03:21.780> percent<00:03:22.110> location

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
footage so twenty percent location

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:26.210 
footage so twenty percent location
influence<00:03:23.070> is<00:03:23.220> probably<00:03:23.700> too<00:03:24.299> much<00:03:25.160> so<00:03:26.160> you

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
influence is probably too much so you

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.550 
influence is probably too much so you
should<00:03:26.670> rather<00:03:27.480> lower<00:03:27.900> that<00:03:28.200> to<00:03:28.350> something

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
should rather lower that to something

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.910 
should rather lower that to something
really<00:03:29.239> low<00:03:30.239> maybe<00:03:30.989> like<00:03:31.260> that<00:03:31.590> and

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
really low maybe like that and

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.670 
really low maybe like that and
especially<00:03:32.730> on<00:03:33.239> a<00:03:33.269> painting<00:03:33.690> shot<00:03:33.959> I<00:03:34.140> think

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
especially on a painting shot I think

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.380 
especially on a painting shot I think
that<00:03:34.799> the<00:03:34.950> location<00:03:35.610> influence<00:03:35.970> is<00:03:36.090> really

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
that the location influence is really

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.740 
that the location influence is really
not<00:03:36.630> that<00:03:36.780> needed<00:03:37.140> either<00:03:38.600> something<00:03:39.600> that

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
not that needed either something that

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.420 
not that needed either something that
might<00:03:39.959> be<00:03:40.200> really<00:03:40.410> useful<00:03:40.650> though<00:03:41.130> is<00:03:41.370> to

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:41.430 
might be really useful though is to

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.630 
might be really useful though is to
stabilize<00:03:42.209> the<00:03:42.750> rotation<00:03:43.260> so<00:03:43.920> let's<00:03:44.430> turn

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
stabilize the rotation so let's turn

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.640 
stabilize the rotation so let's turn
down<00:03:44.880> the<00:03:45.060> location<00:03:45.329> of<00:03:45.510> ruins<00:03:45.810> 20<00:03:46.290> and

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
down the location of ruins 20 and

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.930 
down the location of ruins 20 and
instead<00:03:47.610> and<00:03:47.820> able<00:03:48.390> stabilize<00:03:49.230> rotation<00:03:50.040> now

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
instead and able stabilize rotation now

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.270 
instead and able stabilize rotation now
we<00:03:51.000> do<00:03:51.329> need<00:03:51.540> a<00:03:51.780> second<00:03:52.320> marker<00:03:52.680> to<00:03:52.799> that<00:03:53.010> and

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
we do need a second marker to that and

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.720 
we do need a second marker to that and
of<00:03:54.239> course<00:03:54.390> we<00:03:54.810> would<00:03:54.959> just<00:03:55.140> use<00:03:55.380> this<00:03:55.620> one<00:03:55.730> so

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
of course we would just use this one so

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.479 
of course we would just use this one so
pick<00:03:57.120> that<00:03:57.150> marker<00:03:57.780> and<00:03:58.019> then<00:03:59.010> click<00:03:59.280> on<00:03:59.370> this

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
pick that marker and then click on this

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.060 
pick that marker and then click on this
little<00:03:59.670> plus<00:03:59.910> sign<00:03:59.970> here<00:04:00.180> so<00:04:00.989> now<00:04:01.170> this<00:04:01.620> marker

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
little plus sign here so now this marker

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.569 
little plus sign here so now this marker
will<00:04:02.220> be<00:04:02.370> used<00:04:02.610> to<00:04:03.239> stabilize<00:04:03.690> the<00:04:04.579> relation

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
will be used to stabilize the relation

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:08.210 
will be used to stabilize the relation
between<00:04:05.610> these<00:04:06.180> two<00:04:06.420> points<00:04:06.799> okay<00:04:07.799> so<00:04:07.860> let's

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
between these two points okay so let's

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.150 
between these two points okay so let's
play<00:04:08.459> back<00:04:08.670> with<00:04:08.850> odd<00:04:09.030> a<00:04:09.299> and<00:04:09.709> you<00:04:10.709> can<00:04:10.890> see

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
play back with odd a and you can see

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.600 
play back with odd a and you can see
here<00:04:11.459> how<00:04:11.730> this<00:04:12.120> dashed<00:04:12.660> outline<00:04:12.989> is<00:04:13.610> changing

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
here how this dashed outline is changing

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.270 
here how this dashed outline is changing
the<00:04:14.640> rotation<00:04:15.269> and<00:04:15.510> with<00:04:16.440> the<00:04:16.590> auto<00:04:16.829> scale

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
the rotation and with the auto scale

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.819 
the rotation and with the auto scale
then<00:04:17.700> it<00:04:17.820> will<00:04:17.910> also<00:04:18.060> make<00:04:18.329> sure<00:04:18.600> that<00:04:19.410> even

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
then it will also make sure that even

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.259 
then it will also make sure that even
though<00:04:19.950> it<00:04:20.100> rotates<00:04:20.519> here<00:04:20.729> that<00:04:20.940> you<00:04:21.120> will

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
though it rotates here that you will

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.589 
though it rotates here that you will
never<00:04:21.450> get<00:04:21.690> black<00:04:22.320> borders<00:04:23.210> all<00:04:24.210> right<00:04:24.450> but

00:04:24.589 --> 00:04:24.599 
never get black borders all right but

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:26.790 
never get black borders all right but
why<00:04:24.660> do<00:04:25.050> you<00:04:25.289> have<00:04:25.500> to<00:04:25.650> enable<00:04:25.979> the

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
why do you have to enable the

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.559 
why do you have to enable the
stable<00:04:27.190> setting<00:04:27.490> here<00:04:27.639> for<00:04:27.789> the<00:04:27.879> display<00:04:28.300> I

00:04:28.559 --> 00:04:28.569 
stable setting here for the display I

00:04:28.569 --> 00:04:30.510 
stable setting here for the display I
mean<00:04:28.810> why<00:04:29.139> can<00:04:29.440> blend<00:04:29.650> and<00:04:29.770> not<00:04:29.889> just<00:04:30.069> use<00:04:30.310> the

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
mean why can blend and not just use the

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.240 
mean why can blend and not just use the
stabilization<00:04:31.090> all<00:04:31.240> together<00:04:31.710> well<00:04:32.710> this<00:04:33.220> is

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
stabilization all together well this is

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.100 
stabilization all together well this is
because<00:04:33.639> of<00:04:33.669> the<00:04:34.000> following<00:04:34.599> workflow

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
because of the following workflow

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.869 
because of the following workflow
because<00:04:35.680> somehow<00:04:35.919> you<00:04:36.039> have<00:04:36.250> to<00:04:36.430> apply<00:04:36.729> this

00:04:36.869 --> 00:04:36.879 
because somehow you have to apply this

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:40.409 
because somehow you have to apply this
stabilization<00:04:37.800> to<00:04:38.800> your<00:04:39.039> footage<00:04:39.490> and<00:04:39.699> to

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
stabilization to your footage and to

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:42.300 
stabilization to your footage and to
your<00:04:40.569> renderings<00:04:41.050> because<00:04:41.680> it<00:04:41.830> is<00:04:41.919> not<00:04:42.069> much

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
your renderings because it is not much

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.869 
your renderings because it is not much
use<00:04:42.550> if<00:04:42.729> you<00:04:42.879> have<00:04:43.139> your<00:04:44.139> stable<00:04:44.949> footage<00:04:45.310> but

00:04:45.869 --> 00:04:45.879 
use if you have your stable footage but

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:49.020 
use if you have your stable footage but
then<00:04:46.090> all<00:04:46.360> of<00:04:46.449> a<00:04:46.750> sudden<00:04:47.020> you<00:04:47.169> have<00:04:47.319> not<00:04:48.159> stable

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
then all of a sudden you have not stable

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.140 
then all of a sudden you have not stable
3d<00:04:49.840> objects<00:04:50.379> or<00:04:50.500> empties<00:04:51.250> or<00:04:51.610> stuff<00:04:51.970> like<00:04:52.090> that

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
3d objects or empties or stuff like that

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.899 
3d objects or empties or stuff like that
so<00:04:52.840> for<00:04:53.229> the<00:04:53.319> workflow<00:04:53.710> you<00:04:54.069> have<00:04:54.310> to<00:04:54.550> enable

00:04:54.899 --> 00:04:54.909 
so for the workflow you have to enable

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:56.700 
so for the workflow you have to enable
to<00:04:55.210> do<00:04:55.330> stabilization<00:04:55.539> here<00:04:56.259> to<00:04:56.440> make<00:04:56.560> sure

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
to do stabilization here to make sure

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.920 
to do stabilization here to make sure
that<00:04:56.889> you<00:04:56.979> do<00:04:57.220> have<00:04:57.430> the<00:04:57.490> stabilization<00:04:58.210> then

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
that you do have the stabilization then

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.920 
that you do have the stabilization then
you<00:04:59.229> can<00:04:59.409> control<00:04:59.800> if<00:05:00.190> it<00:05:00.280> works<00:05:00.520> by<00:05:01.360> enabling

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
you can control if it works by enabling

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.860 
you can control if it works by enabling
this<00:05:02.349> button<00:05:02.800> but<00:05:03.729> for<00:05:03.909> the<00:05:04.000> final<00:05:04.330> output<00:05:04.509> it

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
this button but for the final output it

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.129 
this button but for the final output it
doesn't<00:05:05.139> matter<00:05:05.289> if<00:05:05.440> this<00:05:05.620> is<00:05:05.710> enabled<00:05:06.129> or<00:05:06.219> not

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:07.139 
doesn't matter if this is enabled or not

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:10.619 
doesn't matter if this is enabled or not
so<00:05:08.139> let's<00:05:08.169> disable<00:05:08.800> it<00:05:09.039> may<00:05:09.219> be<00:05:09.280> and<00:05:09.669> then<00:05:10.389> in

00:05:10.619 --> 00:05:10.629 
so let's disable it may be and then in

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:13.110 
so let's disable it may be and then in
the<00:05:10.990> final<00:05:11.199> composite<00:05:11.740> then<00:05:12.490> you<00:05:12.639> have<00:05:12.879> to

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
the final composite then you have to

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:18.330 
the final composite then you have to
stabilize<00:05:13.629> the<00:05:13.900> footage<00:05:14.530> and<00:05:14.680> the<00:05:15.460> 3d<00:05:17.009> so<00:05:18.009> to

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
stabilize the footage and the 3d so to

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.790 
stabilize the footage and the 3d so to
do<00:05:18.460> that<00:05:18.490> you<00:05:19.240> just<00:05:19.270> go<00:05:19.629> to<00:05:19.690> your<00:05:19.960> compositing

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
do that you just go to your compositing

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.959 
do that you just go to your compositing
layout<00:05:21.190> button<00:05:21.520> control<00:05:22.060> left<00:05:22.479> arrow<00:05:22.750> and

00:05:23.959 --> 00:05:23.969 
layout button control left arrow and

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:28.740 
layout button control left arrow and
then<00:05:25.680> right<00:05:26.680> here<00:05:26.849> after<00:05:27.849> everything<00:05:28.180> else

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750 
then right here after everything else

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.850 
then right here after everything else
you<00:05:29.409> can<00:05:29.590> add<00:05:29.830> a<00:05:30.009> new<00:05:30.250> node<00:05:30.810> so<00:05:31.810> shift<00:05:32.289> a<00:05:32.529> and

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
you can add a new node so shift a and

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.180 
you can add a new node so shift a and
then<00:05:33.610> in<00:05:33.789> the<00:05:33.940> distort<00:05:34.419> menu<00:05:34.930> you<00:05:35.770> have<00:05:35.800> to

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
then in the distort menu you have to

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.990 
then in the distort menu you have to
stabilize<00:05:36.699> to<00:05:37.360> the<00:05:37.569> node<00:05:38.370> so<00:05:39.370> we<00:05:39.550> can<00:05:39.729> just

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
stabilize to the node so we can just

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.409 
stabilize to the node so we can just
drag<00:05:40.389> that<00:05:40.419> between<00:05:41.289> here<00:05:41.800> and<00:05:41.949> then<00:05:42.940> if<00:05:43.180> it<00:05:43.330> is

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:43.419 
drag that between here and then if it is

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:45.300 
drag that between here and then if it is
not<00:05:43.569> set<00:05:43.840> automatically<00:05:44.349> you<00:05:44.710> can<00:05:44.949> choose

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
not set automatically you can choose

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.879 
not set automatically you can choose
which<00:05:45.940> movie<00:05:46.810> clip<00:05:46.960> you<00:05:47.080> want<00:05:47.229> to<00:05:47.319> use<00:05:47.500> and<00:05:47.800> of

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:47.889 
which movie clip you want to use and of

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:50.519 
which movie clip you want to use and of
course<00:05:48.099> it's<00:05:48.279> that<00:05:48.669> one<00:05:48.940> in<00:05:49.090> our<00:05:49.210> case<00:05:49.529> so

00:05:50.519 --> 00:05:50.529 
course it's that one in our case so

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:53.820 
course it's that one in our case so
let's<00:05:51.219> bring<00:05:51.580> the<00:05:51.880> viewer<00:05:52.449> node<00:05:52.690> here<00:05:52.990> by<00:05:53.199> ctrl

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
let's bring the viewer node here by ctrl

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.100 
let's bring the viewer node here by ctrl
shift<00:05:53.860> clicking<00:05:54.610> on<00:05:54.849> this<00:05:55.000> node<00:05:55.270> and<00:05:55.509> you<00:05:55.990> can

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:56.110 
shift clicking on this node and you can

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.369 
shift clicking on this node and you can
see<00:05:56.319> how<00:05:56.349> it<00:05:56.500> changes<00:05:57.009> so<00:05:57.669> it<00:05:58.389> will<00:05:58.659> scale<00:05:58.990> up

00:05:59.369 --> 00:05:59.379 
see how it changes so it will scale up

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:02.399 
see how it changes so it will scale up
and<00:05:59.770> rotate<00:06:00.460> and<00:06:00.759> stabilize<00:06:01.270> the<00:06:01.300> footage<00:06:02.169> and

00:06:02.399 --> 00:06:02.409 
and rotate and stabilize the footage and

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:04.769 
and rotate and stabilize the footage and
the<00:06:03.279> 3d<00:06:03.729> and<00:06:03.909> that<00:06:04.000> is<00:06:04.090> of<00:06:04.210> course<00:06:04.330> important

00:06:04.769 --> 00:06:04.779 
the 3d and that is of course important

00:06:04.779 --> 00:06:07.019 
the 3d and that is of course important
because<00:06:04.900> you<00:06:05.169> have<00:06:05.349> to<00:06:05.520> stabilize<00:06:06.520> both

00:06:07.019 --> 00:06:07.029 
because you have to stabilize both

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:10.559 
because you have to stabilize both
obviously<00:06:08.430> now<00:06:09.430> the<00:06:09.490> advantage<00:06:10.000> to<00:06:10.270> that<00:06:10.419> is

00:06:10.559 --> 00:06:10.569 
obviously now the advantage to that is

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:13.019 
obviously now the advantage to that is
that<00:06:10.719> if<00:06:11.080> you<00:06:11.319> are<00:06:11.590> stabilizing<00:06:12.580> moving

00:06:13.019 --> 00:06:13.029 
that if you are stabilizing moving

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:15.200 
that if you are stabilizing moving
objects<00:06:13.509> or<00:06:13.599> a<00:06:14.020> shot<00:06:14.259> with<00:06:14.440> a<00:06:14.500> moving<00:06:14.770> camera

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.210

that<00:06:16.210> you<00:06:16.389> will<00:06:16.599> keep<00:06:16.960> the<00:06:17.289> correct<00:06:17.680> vector

00:06:18.149 --> 00:06:18.159 
that you will keep the correct vector

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:20.219 
that you will keep the correct vector
blur<00:06:18.430> if<00:06:18.639> you<00:06:18.789> apply<00:06:19.090> that<00:06:19.330> because

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:20.229 
blur if you apply that because

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:22.050 
blur if you apply that because
especially<00:06:20.469> if<00:06:20.770> you<00:06:20.860> have<00:06:20.889> sudden<00:06:21.550> movements

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:22.060 
especially if you have sudden movements

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.869 
especially if you have sudden movements
or<00:06:22.150> fast<00:06:22.919> movements<00:06:23.919> then<00:06:24.490> you<00:06:24.669> will<00:06:24.819> have

00:06:24.869 --> 00:06:24.879 
or fast movements then you will have

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:28.170 
or fast movements then you will have
some<00:06:25.150> motion<00:06:25.539> blur<00:06:25.690> in<00:06:25.870> your<00:06:26.020> footage<00:06:26.409> and<00:06:27.180> you

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:28.180 
some motion blur in your footage and you

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.570 
some motion blur in your footage and you
have<00:06:28.300> to<00:06:28.509> match<00:06:28.719> that<00:06:28.750> motion<00:06:29.409> blur<00:06:29.650> in<00:06:29.949> your

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:30.580 
have to match that motion blur in your

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.570 
have to match that motion blur in your
3d<00:06:31.150> objects<00:06:31.629> of<00:06:31.719> course<00:06:31.960> and<00:06:32.199> we<00:06:33.159> will<00:06:33.310> find

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:33.580 
3d objects of course and we will find

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.550 
3d objects of course and we will find
out<00:06:33.759> how<00:06:34.029> to<00:06:34.090> do<00:06:34.270> that<00:06:34.389> later<00:06:34.599> but<00:06:35.199> the<00:06:35.320> point

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:35.560 
out how to do that later but the point

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.639 
out how to do that later but the point
is<00:06:35.770> the<00:06:36.219> motion<00:06:36.460> blur<00:06:36.820> of<00:06:36.849> your<00:06:37.210> 3d<00:06:37.690> has<00:06:38.380> to

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:38.649 
is the motion blur of your 3d has to

00:06:38.649 --> 00:06:40.380 
is the motion blur of your 3d has to
match<00:06:38.919> the<00:06:39.430> motion<00:06:39.789> blur<00:06:39.909> of<00:06:39.940> your

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:40.390 
match the motion blur of your

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:43.380 
match the motion blur of your
and<00:06:40.830> by<00:06:41.830> making<00:06:42.070> sure<00:06:42.220> that<00:06:42.640> you<00:06:42.730> composite

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:43.390 
and by making sure that you composite

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:47.130 
and by making sure that you composite
footage<00:06:44.110> vector<00:06:44.770> blur<00:06:45.010> and<00:06:45.310> 3d<00:06:46.090> before<00:06:46.990> you

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:47.140 
footage vector blur and 3d before you

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:49.440 
footage vector blur and 3d before you
stabilize<00:06:47.680> it<00:06:47.920> you<00:06:48.430> will<00:06:48.520> make<00:06:48.670> sure<00:06:48.820> that<00:06:49.060> the

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:49.450 
stabilize it you will make sure that the

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:52.410 
stabilize it you will make sure that the
at<00:06:49.690> least<00:06:49.960> the<00:06:50.170> blur<00:06:50.380> will<00:06:50.680> match<00:06:51.300> now<00:06:52.300> of

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:52.420 
at least the blur will match now of

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.000 
at least the blur will match now of
course<00:06:52.570> if<00:06:52.780> the<00:06:52.870> blur<00:06:53.110> your<00:06:53.350> footage<00:06:53.650> is<00:06:53.770> too

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:54.010 
course if the blur your footage is too

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:57.540 
course if the blur your footage is too
much<00:06:54.280> then<00:06:55.030> it<00:06:55.210> will<00:06:55.390> look<00:06:55.630> just<00:06:55.660> funny<00:06:56.550> maybe

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:57.550 
much then it will look just funny maybe

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:02.940 
much then it will look just funny maybe
we<00:06:57.790> can<00:06:58.920> try<00:06:59.920> that<00:07:00.630> by<00:07:01.630> stabilizing<00:07:02.140> one

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:02.950 
we can try that by stabilizing one

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:09.210 
we can try that by stabilizing one
hundred<00:07:03.220> percent<00:07:03.810> so<00:07:07.050> what<00:07:08.050> is<00:07:08.230> KN<00:07:08.680> stable<00:07:09.130> of

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:09.220 
hundred percent so what is KN stable of

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:12.660 
hundred percent so what is KN stable of
course<00:07:10.800> so<00:07:11.800> with<00:07:12.100> one<00:07:12.340> hundred<00:07:12.640> percent

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:12.670 
course so with one hundred percent

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:15.870 
course so with one hundred percent
position<00:07:13.480> stabilization<00:07:14.250> Jeff<00:07:15.250> well<00:07:15.670> of

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:15.880 
position stabilization Jeff well of

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:17.640 
position stabilization Jeff well of
course<00:07:15.970> perfectly<00:07:16.600> stable<00:07:16.840> footage<00:07:17.260> but

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:17.650 
course perfectly stable footage but

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:19.920 
course perfectly stable footage but
there<00:07:17.890> is<00:07:18.010> some<00:07:18.250> sudden<00:07:18.880> blur<00:07:19.150> some<00:07:19.600> sudden

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:19.930 
there is some sudden blur some sudden

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:22.050 
there is some sudden blur some sudden
motion<00:07:20.080> blur<00:07:20.440> and<00:07:20.680> that<00:07:21.160> looks<00:07:21.430> totally<00:07:21.820> weird

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:22.060 
motion blur and that looks totally weird

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:23.730 
motion blur and that looks totally weird
of<00:07:22.180> course<00:07:22.390> so<00:07:22.780> you<00:07:22.870> have<00:07:22.990> to<00:07:23.110> try<00:07:23.350> to<00:07:23.410> make

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:23.740 
of course so you have to try to make

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:27.030 
of course so you have to try to make
sure<00:07:23.950> to<00:07:24.250> not<00:07:24.280> stabilize<00:07:24.940> too<00:07:25.240> much<00:07:25.800> but<00:07:26.800> well

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:27.040 
sure to not stabilize too much but well

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.670 
sure to not stabilize too much but well
that<00:07:27.550> is<00:07:27.700> how<00:07:27.880> you<00:07:27.910> can<00:07:28.180> use<00:07:28.500> stabilization<00:07:29.500> in

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:29.680 
that is how you can use stabilization in

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.100 
that is how you can use stabilization in
blender
