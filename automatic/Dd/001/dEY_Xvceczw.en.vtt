00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.410
 and for all kids good good 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.380
 watching you teach a little tutorial of 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.720
 how to use them anders I already know that I have 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.730
 already a long time to the thunder and that the 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.250
 jeet kune let's see custom of 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.960
 whites 2 and good or so is to teach 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.590
 how does it work 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.019
 you can not see gun is this mastodon and 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.820
 next you have two but not less we have 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:40.640
 that being temperature that is the one that 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:46.820
 it marks the warming of the good being 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:49.100
 the weapon and the one on the right is that of the 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.019
 weapon enhancer evils that when 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.900
 more or less the enhancer the needle is 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:55.040
 in half unknown do the effect and 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.500
 also what I come to teach you a 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.570
 little trick better the seen of what 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.290
 that I've seen poker this Saturday 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:05.630
 to do is a conviction kid we are 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.460
 in all this and I 'm going it pretty 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.440
 well and if many of my subscribers do not 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.360
 they know him as I upload him and anybody 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.680
 I'd say that's the channel that was not 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.440
 pretty good 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.960
 and good to the way that during down 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:22.730
 the route but nothing happens and what we 're going 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:26.330
 to do let's try to get the 

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:28.370
 just gun is already firing and take off 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.610
 will be gun the same time then what 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.740
 does is the power booster goes up 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.890
 almost half and the weapon is not 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.360
 reheated so much went faster to the 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.590
 time to kill and it does not heat up as much 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.660
 is well decided is that it is called the 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.479
 you're the butt busting to 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.970
 do not know how that sector goes more or less 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.250
 more is simple does not go with ammunition nor 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.470
 nothing you already know that at the beginning of 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.500
 I play your villa how the weapon was built 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.840
 and well let's go here makes these little 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.550
 20 tutorial so you know how it goes and 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.350
 more or less is what explains in this 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.649
 video alex fixes has here the 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.650
 pellet and let's take it out and now 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.480
 we tighten fixed 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.820
 and it's called the mind is being born here and 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.560
 the needle does not go up and almost half and 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:15.659
 you know fix the potentiometer of the 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:19.750
 power is almost almost complete 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:21.849
 Now what I'm going to do is ride in 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.730
 bike which I advise you to join 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:26.440
 zombie bug balls for almost 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.450
 they kill them themselves and the 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.220
 mates in group and throwing and everything 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.200
 take you to the room and the point takes you 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.020
 in front it's loaded 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.360
 and that's the good thing to do balls be 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.580
 the days of zombies and it's the simplest thing 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.900
 what can be done if we kill this 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:45.489
 team since it bothers us and we take 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.300
 let's change the weapon while we go out 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.459
 shooting up 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.680
 change your weapon and hit him 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.849
 quickly the great care base is very 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.849
 simple to see is that we're going to do 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:58.510
 know that it is the real one and we rotate and 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:59.650
 we are tightening things and arrives 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:02.440
 Halfway through we've already arrived 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.000
 until halfway down the 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.700
 packaged more cool you have to 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.620
 leave it exposed you have to take the 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.380
 put if it does not cool the let's say it's 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:15.569
 there the rest in the warm up and I 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:18.599
 I'm going to remove it for example not while 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:21.790
 you can fix now I can take it out and 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:22.569
 you have lowered us the only code that 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.910
 due to the closet 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:29.260
 I believe that it has position so that it lowered 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:33.450
 alone and good to show you half tutorial 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:36.099
 how it was used was like that and that's 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.660
 quite well is a way to endure 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:40.450
 more with the weapon without it bursting 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:43.959
 Go faster and do not get hot 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.340
 the fucking weapon that is the only thing many people 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.980
 it's crap I think it's 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:50.440
 pretty good if you know how to use it is 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.269
 but good that all are missing here and 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.190
 the potentiometer comes out all the way and we 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.450
 we charge in telling you that now he has me 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.880
 a force that moves towards 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:59.769
 front or back that is a bit 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.959
 Fucked, well, I'll tell you more or less 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:04.090
 up to half and not go changing 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:07.889
 weapons because it weighs a lot and they can 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.889
 kill again 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:14.920
 a room usually goes up and there's nothing else 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.829
 no more complicated for people who do not 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:22.590
 I knew and it's going pretty good, I'm going 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:22.590
 to enter here and I'm going to load all 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.700
 but I hope it looks pretty good 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.700
 Boys 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:36.440
 let's remove the let's say we're 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.440
 shooting up 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.040
 only also because the bands of 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.520
 jazz but it 's practical most of 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:46.500
 times 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:49.040
 and what better diagonal right now 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.040
 yes 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.940
 has at the same time 

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:58.639
 we give you what is going to be done like this 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:05:01.069
 simple short the guards to take it out 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:02.719
 without quietly to a cat you will take 

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:04.759
 because what I said the gun 

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:07.009
 push forward and that's a bit 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:09.370
 shit but it's because of the power that 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:09.370
 we carry 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:17.390
 to the sale of the weapon 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:31.400
 a boy who has suffered enough 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:33.170
 well the tutorial better upload it and also 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.300
 it's one thing that when he built it 

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:37.610
 use it below leave the link of the 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.620
 video that I made where all the 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:43.060
 pieces in case you do not know and until the 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.060
 next and the kids see you
