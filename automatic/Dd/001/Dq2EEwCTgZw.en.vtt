00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
awareness month I think that's a

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.690 
awareness month I think that's a
fantastic<00:02:54.030> cause<00:02:54.890> not<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.070> reason<00:02:56.220> I<00:02:56.430> wanted

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
fantastic cause not the reason I wanted

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.370 
fantastic cause not the reason I wanted
to<00:02:56.760> shatter<00:02:57.090> I<00:02:57.239> just<00:02:57.540> wanted<00:02:57.840> it<00:02:57.959> because<00:02:58.020> it's

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
to shatter I just wanted it because it's

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.270 
to shatter I just wanted it because it's
pink<00:02:58.820> I<00:02:59.820> have<00:03:00.330> several<00:03:01.140> shatters<00:03:01.739> and<00:03:02.010> I'll<00:03:02.160> be

pink I have several shatters and I'll be

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.650

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
very often I really like the black but I

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.470 
very often I really like the black but I
have<00:03:06.330> to<00:03:06.480> be<00:03:06.510> in<00:03:06.600> the<00:03:06.780> mood<00:03:06.930> for<00:03:07.230> it<00:03:07.970> I<00:03:08.970> love<00:03:09.330> the

have to be in the mood for it I love the

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.360 
have to be in the mood for it I love the
white<00:03:09.660> shadow<00:03:09.959> I<00:03:10.170> love<00:03:10.380> the<00:03:10.530> red<00:03:10.709> shatter<00:03:11.070> and

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
white shadow I love the red shatter and

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.470 
white shadow I love the red shatter and
I<00:03:11.880> like<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.390> gray<00:03:12.980> crackle<00:03:13.980> from<00:03:14.519> China<00:03:15.330> Glaze

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
I like the gray crackle from China Glaze

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.720 
I like the gray crackle from China Glaze
like<00:03:16.350> they're<00:03:16.530> all<00:03:16.680> kind<00:03:16.920> of<00:03:16.980> neutral<00:03:17.190> colors

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
like they're all kind of neutral colors

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:18.979 
like they're all kind of neutral colors
and<00:03:18.060> I<00:03:18.120> just<00:03:18.299> think<00:03:18.450> they<00:03:18.540> add<00:03:18.720> a<00:03:18.750> little

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
and I just think they add a little

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.300 
and I just think they add a little
something<00:03:19.230> when<00:03:19.560> you<00:03:19.620> just<00:03:19.799> do<00:03:19.980> one<00:03:20.160> or<00:03:20.280> two

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
something when you just do one or two

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.640 
something when you just do one or two
nails<00:03:20.750> and<00:03:21.750> then<00:03:21.840> every<00:03:22.080> now<00:03:22.110> and<00:03:22.320> then<00:03:22.410> I<00:03:22.500> go

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
nails and then every now and then I go

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.050 
nails and then every now and then I go
crazy<00:03:22.920> and<00:03:23.130> I<00:03:23.190> do<00:03:23.250> all<00:03:23.340> of<00:03:23.489> them<00:03:23.760> I<00:03:23.850> don't<00:03:24.000> know

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
crazy and I do all of them I don't know

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.690 
crazy and I do all of them I don't know
but<00:03:24.840> I<00:03:25.110> knew<00:03:25.410> I<00:03:25.440> wanted<00:03:25.860> the<00:03:25.980> pink<00:03:26.190> ones<00:03:26.400> so

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
but I knew I wanted the pink ones so

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.360 
but I knew I wanted the pink ones so
they<00:03:27.510> finally<00:03:27.810> took<00:03:28.230> pity<00:03:28.530> on<00:03:28.620> me<00:03:28.920> and<00:03:28.950> said

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
they finally took pity on me and said

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.009 
they finally took pity on me and said

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
orange so I don't recommend that but I

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:28.850 
orange so I don't recommend that but I
think<00:04:27.870> if<00:04:28.110> you<00:04:28.199> put<00:04:28.320> a<00:04:28.380> white<00:04:28.620> polish

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
think if you put a white polish

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:34.460 
think if you put a white polish
underneath<00:04:29.460> or<00:04:29.699> um<00:04:30.600> a<00:04:31.289> dove<00:04:31.770> gray<00:04:33.199> whatever<00:04:34.199> I

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
underneath or um a dove gray whatever I

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:35.930 
underneath or um a dove gray whatever I
don't<00:04:34.650> do<00:04:34.919> a<00:04:34.949> glitter<00:04:35.220> and<00:04:35.430> then<00:04:35.520> put<00:04:35.669> the<00:04:35.759> pink

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
don't do a glitter and then put the pink

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.790 
don't do a glitter and then put the pink
on<00:04:36.090> top<00:04:36.270> I<00:04:36.419> think<00:04:36.630> it'll<00:04:36.750> be<00:04:36.870> super<00:04:37.080> cute<00:04:37.350> so<00:04:37.620> I

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.279 
on top I think it'll be super cute so I
did<00:04:38.280> think<00:04:38.460> it<00:04:38.520> was<00:04:38.580> going<00:04:38.789> to<00:04:38.850> be<00:04:39.030> more<00:04:39.300> like<00:04:39.360> I

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:40.289 
did think it was going to be more like I

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:45.469 
did think it was going to be more like I
don't<00:04:40.350> have<00:04:40.530> anything<00:04:43.850> maybe<00:04:44.850> more<00:04:45.120> like<00:04:45.240> this
