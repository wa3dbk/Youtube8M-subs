00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
hello and right one or two of you who

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.690 
hello and right one or two of you who
asked<00:00:03.330> me<00:00:03.389> and<00:00:03.810> what<00:00:04.279> settings<00:00:05.279> they<00:00:05.370> use<00:00:05.549> on

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
asked me and what settings they use on

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.799 
asked me and what settings they use on
my<00:00:05.819> e<00:00:05.850> track<00:00:06.210> so<00:00:07.080> the<00:00:07.319> best<00:00:07.470> thing<00:00:07.589> I<00:00:07.649> can<00:00:07.710> do<00:00:07.919> is

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:08.809 
my e track so the best thing I can do is

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.470 
my e track so the best thing I can do is
clearly<00:00:09.809> a<00:00:09.990> setup<00:00:10.889> video<00:00:11.179> so<00:00:12.179> we're<00:00:12.330> switching

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
clearly a setup video so we're switching

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.200 
clearly a setup video so we're switching
on<00:00:13.250> I've<00:00:14.250> got<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.490> headphones<00:00:14.610> on<00:00:15.000> so<00:00:15.120> you

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
on I've got the headphones on so you

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.840 
on I've got the headphones on so you
want<00:00:15.360> that<00:00:15.480> hear<00:00:15.719> it<00:00:15.920> and<00:00:16.920> now<00:00:17.340> we<00:00:17.400> start<00:00:17.730> with

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
want that hear it and now we start with

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.500 
want that hear it and now we start with
patents<00:00:18.449> and<00:00:19.430> this<00:00:20.430> is<00:00:20.640> my<00:00:20.760> pattern<00:00:21.060> and<00:00:21.390> it's

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
patents and this is my pattern and it's

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.380 
patents and this is my pattern and it's
the<00:00:21.660> UK<00:00:22.020> Roman<00:00:22.439> pan<00:00:23.000> and<00:00:24.000> it's<00:00:24.240> what<00:00:24.359> I

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
the UK Roman pan and it's what I

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.830 
the UK Roman pan and it's what I
recommend<00:00:25.130> because<00:00:26.130> that<00:00:26.849> is<00:00:27.000> all<00:00:27.180> iron<00:00:27.599> and

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
recommend because that is all iron and

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.880 
recommend because that is all iron and
the<00:00:28.080> rest<00:00:28.910> depending<00:00:29.910> on<00:00:30.029> whereabouts<00:00:30.449> it<00:00:30.599> is

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
the rest depending on whereabouts it is

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.139 
the rest depending on whereabouts it is
you'd<00:00:31.890> normally<00:00:32.070> pigs<00:00:32.489> if<00:00:32.669> you're<00:00:32.790> on<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.910> beach

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
you'd normally pigs if you're on a beach

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.639 
you'd normally pigs if you're on a beach
and<00:00:33.390> you<00:00:33.480> get<00:00:33.660> something<00:00:34.050> down<00:00:34.200> this<00:00:34.440> edge

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
and you get something down this edge

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.880 
and you get something down this edge
here<00:00:34.790> it's<00:00:35.790> going<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.000> be<00:00:36.059> tinfoil<00:00:36.649> if<00:00:37.649> you<00:00:37.770> get

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
here it's going to be tinfoil if you get

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.709 
here it's going to be tinfoil if you get
something<00:00:38.040> along<00:00:38.309> all<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.730> top<00:00:38.969> here<00:00:39.300> then

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
something along all the top here then

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.900 
something along all the top here then
it's<00:00:39.840> gonna<00:00:39.930> be<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.050> big<00:00:40.260> bowl<00:00:40.440> top<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:40.980> and

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
it's gonna be a big bowl top and and

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.410 
it's gonna be a big bowl top and and
anything<00:00:42.390> in<00:00:42.510> centre<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.860> dig<00:00:44.329> basically<00:00:45.329> up

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
anything in centre you dig basically up

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.910 
anything in centre you dig basically up
that's<00:00:45.750> how<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:45.930> do<00:00:46.110> it<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.649> seems<00:00:46.680> to

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
that's how I do it and it seems to

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.430 
that's how I do it and it seems to
working<00:00:47.430> because<00:00:48.239> anything<00:00:48.809> I<00:00:48.989> take<00:00:49.200> along

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
working because anything I take along

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.600 
working because anything I take along
here<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:49.770> tinfoil

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
here is tinfoil

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.630 
here is tinfoil
anything<00:00:51.059> along<00:00:51.270> here<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:52.190> even<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.309> big<00:00:53.460> lump

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
anything along here is even a big lump

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.060 
anything along here is even a big lump
of<00:00:53.699> iron<00:00:53.879> or<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:55.640> tabletop<00:00:57.260> and<00:00:58.260> so<00:00:58.739> that's<00:00:58.890> my

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
of iron or a tabletop and so that's my

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.160 
of iron or a tabletop and so that's my
pattern<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.670> use<00:00:59.910> I<00:01:00.180> never<00:01:00.420> use<00:01:00.570> anything<00:01:00.840> built

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
pattern I use I never use anything built

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.889 
pattern I use I never use anything built
patterns<00:01:01.620> because<00:01:02.210> there's<00:01:03.210> no<00:01:03.300> point<00:01:03.480> that

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
patterns because there's no point that

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.950 
patterns because there's no point that
is<00:01:04.049> just<00:01:04.530> perfect<00:01:04.830> one<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:05.450> for<00:01:06.450> those<00:01:06.600> not

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
is just perfect one so for those not

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.660 
is just perfect one so for those not
aware<00:01:07.049> of<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.860> each<00:01:07.950> rack<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.220> is<00:01:08.549> your

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
aware of the each rack that is your

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.910 
aware of the each rack that is your
discrimination<00:01:09.390> pattern<00:01:09.650> anything<00:01:10.650> blacked

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
discrimination pattern anything blacked

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.090 
discrimination pattern anything blacked
out<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.610> will<00:01:12.150> not<00:01:12.330> find<00:01:12.710> anything<00:01:13.710> in<00:01:14.010> the

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
out it will not find anything in the

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.840 
out it will not find anything in the
clear<00:01:14.340> area<00:01:14.549> is<00:01:14.970> what's<00:01:15.270> going<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.509> get<00:01:16.850> tense

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
clear area is what's going to get tense

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.749 
clear area is what's going to get tense
it<00:01:17.939> gives<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.150> down<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.450> side<00:01:19.310> I'm<00:01:20.310> using

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
it gives you down the side I'm using

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.640 
it gives you down the side I'm using
auto<00:01:21.119> plus<00:01:21.540> three<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.049> that's<00:01:22.290> what<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.470> always

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
auto plus three and that's what I always

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.160 
auto plus three and that's what I always
use<00:01:22.950> and<00:01:23.450> occasionally<00:01:24.450> have<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.659> look<00:01:24.869> about

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
use and occasionally have a look about

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.140 
use and occasionally have a look about
what<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.500> auto<00:01:25.619> setting<00:01:26.430> is<00:01:26.580> at<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.820> moment

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
what the auto setting is at the moment

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.319 
what the auto setting is at the moment
it's<00:01:27.270> on<00:01:27.360> 19<00:01:28.369> which<00:01:29.369> is<00:01:29.400> not<00:01:29.759> bad

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
it's on 19 which is not bad

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.539 
it's on 19 which is not bad
so<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.960> grounds<00:01:31.409> got<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.310> bit<00:01:32.460> of

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
so the grounds got a bit of

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.460 
so the grounds got a bit of
mineralization<00:01:33.150> or<00:01:33.600> we<00:01:33.810> might<00:01:33.960> be<00:01:34.110> selling<00:01:34.380> a

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
mineralization or we might be selling a

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.490 
mineralization or we might be selling a
property<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:35.220> iron<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.930> your<00:01:36.930> manuals<00:01:37.350> you

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
property of iron and your manuals you

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.749 
property of iron and your manuals you
flick<00:01:37.829> there<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.490> set<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.210> 20<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.860> 22<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:41.040> 24<00:01:41.490> and

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
flick there I set to 20 to 22 to 24 and

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.270 
flick there I set to 20 to 22 to 24 and
then<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.360> don't<00:01:42.540> get<00:01:42.630> too<00:01:42.810> much<00:01:42.930> pulsing<00:01:43.470> but

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
then you don't get too much pulsing but

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.270 
then you don't get too much pulsing but
Auto<00:01:44.549> +3<00:01:45.270> is<00:01:45.509> what<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:46.200> always<00:01:46.470> use<00:01:46.740> us<00:01:47.070> about

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
Auto +3 is what I always use us about

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:54.319 
Auto +3 is what I always use us about
the<00:01:47.399> best<00:01:48.200> so<00:01:49.200> we'll<00:01:49.799> go<00:01:49.979> into<00:01:51.320> the<00:01:52.320> menu<00:01:53.329> I'll

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
the best so we'll go into the menu I'll

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.139 
the best so we'll go into the menu I'll
just<00:01:54.509> come<00:01:54.750> back<00:01:54.960> here<00:01:55.409> so<00:01:56.250> user<00:01:56.549> modes<00:01:56.850> I

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
just come back here so user modes I

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.789 
just come back here so user modes I
never<00:01:57.450> touch<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:57.719> because<00:01:58.020> that's<00:01:58.200> all<00:01:58.439> the

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
never touch it because that's all the

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.280 
never touch it because that's all the
patterns<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.490> setup<00:01:59.909> I<00:02:00.090> never<00:02:00.390> touch<00:02:00.600> it<00:02:00.630> just

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
patterns and setup I never touch it just

um<00:02:45.620> this<00:02:46.620> is<00:02:46.769> quite<00:02:46.890> an<00:02:47.010> important<00:02:47.400> one

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
um this is quite an important one

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.910 
um this is quite an important one
because<00:02:48.450> this<00:02:48.690> differs<00:02:49.110> for<00:02:49.319> many<00:02:49.560> but<00:02:49.769> I

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
because this differs for many but I

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.840 
because this differs for many but I
found<00:02:50.220> this<00:02:51.180> works<00:02:51.660> probably<00:02:52.019> ok<00:02:52.850> threshold

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
found this works probably ok threshold

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.729 
found this works probably ok threshold
15<00:02:54.269> so<00:02:54.720> you've<00:02:54.870> just<00:02:54.900> got<00:02:55.260> a<00:02:55.290> little<00:02:55.319> bit<00:02:55.650> of

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.960 
15 so you've just got a little bit of

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.990 
responses normal and this is the
important<00:03:08.280> one<00:03:09.200> threshold<00:03:10.200> pitch<00:03:10.530> 15<00:03:11.220> but<00:03:11.970> the

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
important one threshold pitch 15 but the

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.100 
important one threshold pitch 15 but the
important<00:03:12.569> one<00:03:12.660> is<00:03:12.870> tone<00:03:13.230> ID<00:03:13.470> this<00:03:14.130> is<00:03:14.930> this<00:03:15.930> is

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
important one is tone ID this is this is

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
important one is tone ID this is this is
how<00:03:16.230> I<00:03:16.290> love<00:03:16.680> it

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
how I love it

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.770 
how I love it
so<00:03:17.790> go<00:03:17.970> into<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:18.269> tone<00:03:18.480> ID<00:03:19.340> for<00:03:20.340> tones<00:03:20.780> and

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
so go into the tone ID for tones and

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.610 
so go into the tone ID for tones and
sound<00:03:22.650> Tharus<00:03:23.160> now<00:03:23.370> anyone<00:03:24.000> that<00:03:24.060> Sam<00:03:24.620> heard

someone with an e-type haven't got one

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:27.880 
someone with an e-type haven't got one
you

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
you

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.599 
you
they<00:03:28.890> aren't<00:03:29.069> they<00:03:29.190> often<00:03:29.400> up<00:03:29.489> this

they aren't they often up this

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:32.020 
they aren't they often up this
multi-tone<00:03:30.239> so<00:03:30.720> they<00:03:30.840> go<00:03:30.959> over<00:03:30.989> targeted

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
multi-tone so they go over targeted

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.229 
multi-tone so they go over targeted
sound<00:03:33.030> like<00:03:33.440> r2d2<00:03:34.440> or<00:03:34.890> something<00:03:35.250> I<00:03:35.430> can't<00:03:36.090> get

I<00:03:36.750> really<00:03:37.230> cannot<00:03:37.530> get<00:03:37.650> on<00:03:37.769> with<00:03:37.890> it<00:03:38.040> so<00:03:38.780> tones

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
I really cannot get on with it so tones

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.920

I works out is to do with the amount of
iron<00:04:45.930> so<00:04:46.930> if<00:04:47.020> you<00:04:47.139> get<00:04:47.289> lots<00:04:47.530> of<00:04:47.620> false<00:04:47.860> signals

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
iron so if you get lots of false signals

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.580 
iron so if you get lots of false signals
over<00:04:48.310> iron<00:04:48.840> and<00:04:49.840> there<00:04:49.960> is<00:04:50.050> a<00:04:50.080> lot<00:04:50.259> of<00:04:50.319> iron

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
over iron and there is a lot of iron

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
over iron and there is a lot of iron
because<00:04:50.800> you<00:04:50.889> can<00:04:51.009> get<00:04:52.560> blanking<00:04:53.560> it<00:04:53.740> then

I have it low I just depends how much

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.730 
I have it low I just depends how much
iron<00:05:02.289> there<00:05:02.440> is<00:05:02.610> ground<00:05:03.610> neutral<00:05:04.300> or

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
iron there is ground neutral or

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:08.430 
iron there is ground neutral or
difficult<00:05:05.740> and<00:05:06.580> that<00:05:07.090> is<00:05:07.180> just<00:05:07.330> to<00:05:07.449> suit<00:05:07.810> the

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
difficult and that is just to suit the

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.710 
difficult and that is just to suit the
type<00:05:08.620> of<00:05:08.650> condition<00:05:09.039> you're<00:05:09.220> in<00:05:09.419> these<00:05:10.419> are

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
type of condition you're in these are

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.350 
type of condition you're in these are
the<00:05:11.410> the<00:05:12.009> fourth<00:05:12.250> things<00:05:12.550> if<00:05:12.970> you<00:05:13.090> got<00:05:13.240> any

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
the the fourth things if you got any

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.409 
the the fourth things if you got any
track<00:05:13.599> you<00:05:14.199> need<00:05:14.349> to<00:05:14.440> research<00:05:14.800> I<00:05:15.699> normally

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:16.419 
track you need to research I normally

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:20.330 
track you need to research I normally
just<00:05:16.449> leave<00:05:16.720> them<00:05:16.960> as<00:05:17.050> it<00:05:17.229> is<00:05:18.120> probably<00:05:19.120> on<00:05:19.270> low

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
just leave them as it is probably on low

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.839 
just leave them as it is probably on low
record<00:05:21.340> fast<00:05:21.550> on<00:05:21.729> and<00:05:21.940> away<00:05:22.120> again<00:05:22.389> it<00:05:22.690> works

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:23.849 
record fast on and away again it works

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:30.570 
record fast on and away again it works
so<00:05:24.900> the<00:05:25.900> next<00:05:26.139> thing<00:05:26.470> is<00:05:28.949> contrast<00:05:29.949> 15<00:05:30.400> that's

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
so the next thing is contrast 15 that's

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.730 
so the next thing is contrast 15 that's
