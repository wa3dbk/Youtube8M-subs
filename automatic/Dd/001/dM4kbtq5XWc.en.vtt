00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.840
 ladies and gentlemen my name is there 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:19.160
 for 93 and today we are here to give 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:21.170
 take a look at jazz punk I have a game 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.210
 very particular so let's see 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.090
 describe it better then while 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:29.630
 I generally would describe it 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:32.000
 like a point and click adventure bar 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:36.350
 game with a little bit of puzzle here too 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.809
 and there, however, that focuses on humor 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.809
 satire and various jokes of all kinds 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:44.210
 so the game itself is not 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.100
 focused on the mechanics because the 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.930
 Game mechanics are press up 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.500
 various things to make other things happen 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:55.940
 but it is mainly focused 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:58.100
 on all these all these jokes 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.489
 jokes like that are scattered 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.770
 inside game mode the game lasts 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.869
 about three hours 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.310
 exploring everything you can version 4 of 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:09.820
 hurry maybe two though let's say 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.900
 on average about three hours 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.790
 these administrations are full of 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.080
 things to interact with practically 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.939
 the idea is that you are one 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:21.700
 you are in this world that is a world 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:24.710
 futuristic set in a kind of 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.780
 world in which you are a spy and you must 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.320
 going to spy on the Russians in short, something of the 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:33.619
 but genre is set in the future and is 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.240
 very nice because it uses this up 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:38.360
 this world to create within it 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.130
 a lot of funny jokes and there 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.159
 they are a lot of connections with others 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:46.070
 I do n't like ninja turtles 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:47.869
 jokes on computing on millions of 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.420
 things is the game itself is not that 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.460
 have a lot of sense there are side 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.110
 quests that in the end saw nothing 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.090
 because you're used to say the side 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.700
 quests usually tend to give you either 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.560
 fragments of history ascom objects 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.180
 in short, everything 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.619
 the video game in this country this 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.909
 they give you some jokes 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.820
 completely meaningless for example 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.750
 there is a side quest that asks you to 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.780
 kill with investors of 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.709
 ultrasound to capture three pigeons and 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.020
 once you bring these three 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.520
 pigeons the guy says now you have is the 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.170
 my special cake recipe for 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.400
 pigeons ricasso in a microwave and so 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.410
 just the wine pigeons and microwave 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.630
 the cake heats up 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.450
 at the door and when you click on it 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.099
 popped it in his face and this is it 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.780
 a result of the side quest in practice 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.209
 it's already a lot of things like that 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.540
 do they really laugh is the point of 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:37.090
 game is that it is really hilarious and I am 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.090
 sure that for those of you who have a sense of humor 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.370
 a little bit particular will make you laugh there 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.590
 will make three good hours of play 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.269
 because they are really jokes that they do 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.299
 it is a bit difficult to disrupt 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:51.640
 talk about this game because of 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:52.840
 gifts of things to talk spoilers jokes 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.489
 which I absolutely don't want to do then 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.540
 I limited myself to telling myself or an ace 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.400
 there are hundreds of them 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.900
 I don't know how many precise but I do n't 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:04.239
 counted are quite a few however it was alone 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:08.170
 to make you understand the kind of humor that 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:09.760
 you are in this game also that car does 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.410
 can actually say nothing because the 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.620
 game has interesting graphics I have to 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:17.920
 say is the mousse of music I am very 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.780
 details are a strange one if a series 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.030
 of things you can see well here in 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.799
 video that goes behind that I really am 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.940
 hilarious and can't be a game from 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.950
 lose for fans of 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.900
 adventure game and prototype games 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.090
 surely charles benches and a game 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.209
 I'm very sorry if I struggle 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.609
 give you information but describe this 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.670
 game is really difficult because of for 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:41.440
 if not mechanical then it's difficult 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.970
 judge it by mechanics but only 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.260
 these lines this humor that 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:48.609
 hilarious and it's very funny is a bit 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.290
 absurd at times but worth it 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:52.660
 to be played so I have nothing else to 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.280
 tell you the spain a really good title 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.260
 I suggest you try out my name 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.640
 however it has gone 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.260
 and this already has spain is available 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.260
 on steam and see you next time
