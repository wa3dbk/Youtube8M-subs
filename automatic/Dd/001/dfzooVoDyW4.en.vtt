00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
that was in my band so they think that

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.710 
that was in my band so they think that
there's<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.369> leak<00:00:26.640> somewhere<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.390> they<00:00:27.510> need

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
there's a leak somewhere and they need

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.370 
there's a leak somewhere and they need
to<00:00:27.949> re<00:00:28.949> operate<00:00:29.429> on<00:00:29.609> me<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:29.970> find<00:00:30.900> out<00:00:31.140> where

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
to re operate on me to find out where

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.260 
to re operate on me to find out where
the<00:00:31.529> leak<00:00:31.710> is<00:00:32.840> instead<00:00:33.840> of<00:00:33.989> doing<00:00:34.320> this<00:00:34.500> I<00:00:34.739> am

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
the leak is instead of doing this I am

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.880 
the leak is instead of doing this I am
going<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.420> have<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.719> lap<00:00:36.899> band<00:00:37.050> removed<00:00:37.620> and

loss surgery going to do this completely

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.229 
loss surgery going to do this completely
on<00:00:44.460> my<00:00:44.670> own<00:00:46.219> this<00:00:47.219> has<00:00:47.399> been<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.640> complete<00:00:47.969> waste

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
on my own this has been a complete waste

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.560 
on my own this has been a complete waste
of<00:00:48.660> time<00:00:48.899> for<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.260> last<00:00:49.469> year<00:00:50.480> supposed<00:00:51.480> to

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
of time for the last year supposed to

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:58.010 
of time for the last year supposed to
have<00:00:51.800> 9.25<00:00:52.800> cc's<00:00:53.340> in<00:00:53.640> my<00:00:55.399> 9.0<00:00:56.399> band<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.149> I

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
have 9.25 cc's in my 9.0 band and I

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.240 
have 9.25 cc's in my 9.0 band and I
guess<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:58.440> have<00:00:58.649> zero

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
guess I have zero

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.029 
guess I have zero
they<00:00:59.879> didn't<00:01:00.359> endoscopic<00:01:01.260> procedure<00:01:01.800> as<00:01:01.920> you

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
they didn't endoscopic procedure as you

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.650 
they didn't endoscopic procedure as you
can<00:01:02.190> tell<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.399> have<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.699> little<00:01:03.030> bit<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.359> cold

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
right now I think I got it from when I

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.690 
right now I think I got it from when I

anything<00:02:16.440> I<00:02:17.750> don't<00:02:18.750> get<00:02:18.900> stuck<00:02:19.940> it's<00:02:20.940> like

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
anything I don't get stuck it's like

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.090 
anything I don't get stuck it's like
it's<00:02:21.360> not<00:02:21.510> even<00:02:21.570> there<00:02:21.810> but<00:02:22.230> I<00:02:22.260> was<00:02:22.530> feeling<00:02:23.070> a

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
it's not even there but I was feeling a

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:26.570 
it's not even there but I was feeling a
little<00:02:23.490> bit<00:02:23.700> of<00:02:23.790> pain<00:02:24.000> around<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.140> band<00:02:25.580> it

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
little bit of pain around the band it

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.340 
little bit of pain around the band it
was<00:02:26.700> kind<00:02:26.940> of<00:02:26.970> like<00:02:27.090> a<00:02:27.150> constant<00:02:27.690> gasp<00:02:27.930> pain

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
was kind of like a constant gasp pain

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.440 
was kind of like a constant gasp pain
and<00:02:28.590> I<00:02:29.010> guess<00:02:29.220> it's<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.490> polyp<00:02:29.880> because<00:02:30.120> after

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
and I guess it's the polyp because after

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.990 
and I guess it's the polyp because after
I've<00:02:30.540> had<00:02:30.660> it<00:02:30.840> done<00:02:31.020> it<00:02:31.370> felt<00:02:32.370> so<00:02:32.730> much<00:02:32.940> better

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
I've had it done it felt so much better

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.590 
I've had it done it felt so much better

you know fixed or anything plus my port

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.500 
you know fixed or anything plus my port
is<00:03:42.890> it's<00:03:43.890> painful<00:03:44.520> if<00:03:44.670> you<00:03:44.790> put<00:03:44.940> any<00:03:45.180> type<00:03:45.480> of
