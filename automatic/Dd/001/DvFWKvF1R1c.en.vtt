playing on jacinto to show you this will

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.050 
playing on jacinto to show you this will
be<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.080> first<00:00:25.260> tier<00:00:25.619> savage<00:00:26.430> grenadiers<00:00:26.789> and

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
be the first tier savage grenadiers and

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.150 
be the first tier savage grenadiers and
it<00:00:27.150> spawns<00:00:27.420> with<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.630> cleaver<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.740> Gorgon

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
it spawns with a cleaver and a Gorgon

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.310 
it spawns with a cleaver and a Gorgon
pistol<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.699> now<00:00:30.570> a<00:00:30.599> neat<00:00:30.929> little<00:00:31.019> trick<00:00:31.199> that

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
pistol and now a neat little trick that

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.659 
pistol and now a neat little trick that
you<00:00:31.500> can<00:00:31.560> do<00:00:31.740> with<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:31.920> cleaver<00:00:32.130> is<00:00:32.399> that<00:00:32.550> when

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
you can do with the cleaver is that when

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:33.799 
you can do with the cleaver is that when
you<00:00:32.730> come<00:00:32.850> up<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.059> barrier<00:00:33.329> if<00:00:33.480> you<00:00:33.570> swing

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
you come up to a barrier if you swing

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.229 
you come up to a barrier if you swing
the<00:00:33.899> cleaver<00:00:34.079> you<00:00:34.380> come<00:00:34.620> through<00:00:34.969> the<00:00:35.969> barrier

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
the cleaver you come through the barrier

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.520 
the cleaver you come through the barrier
without<00:00:36.329> taking<00:00:36.690> any<00:00:36.840> damage<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.350> very

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
without taking any damage and very

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.630 
without taking any damage and very
quickly<00:00:37.739> so<00:00:37.980> that's<00:00:38.129> a<00:00:38.190> good<00:00:38.280> little<00:00:38.430> trick

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
quickly so that's a good little trick

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.540 
quickly so that's a good little trick
the<00:00:39.210> cleve<00:00:39.390> is<00:00:39.510> quite<00:00:39.690> powerful<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.430> so<00:00:41.430> it's

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
the cleve is quite powerful and so it's

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.220 
the cleve is quite powerful and so it's
pretty<00:00:41.790> useful<00:00:41.879> but<00:00:42.540> if<00:00:42.690> you<00:00:42.809> drop<00:00:43.079> the

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
pretty useful but if you drop the

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.479 
pretty useful but if you drop the
cleaver<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.590> get<00:00:43.710> your<00:00:43.829> Gorgon<00:00:44.100> pistol<00:00:44.430> out

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
cleaver to get your Gorgon pistol out

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.700 
cleaver to get your Gorgon pistol out
then<00:00:45.000> am<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.539> cleaver<00:00:45.780> just<00:00:45.989> disappears<00:00:46.469> and

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
then am the cleaver just disappears and

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.350 
then am the cleaver just disappears and
you<00:00:46.800> can't<00:00:47.070> pick<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.340> up<00:00:47.489> another<00:00:48.090> thing<00:00:48.270> is

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
you can't pick it up another thing is

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.670 
you can't pick it up another thing is
you<00:00:48.450> can't<00:00:48.660> mental<00:00:48.960> /<00:00:49.170> cover<00:00:49.320> when<00:00:49.469> you've<00:00:49.590> got

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
you can't mental / cover when you've got

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.590 
you can't mental / cover when you've got
the<00:00:49.739> cleaver<00:00:50.039> so<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.969> have<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.210> go<00:00:51.329> straight

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
the cleaver so you have to go straight

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.029 
the cleaver so you have to go straight
through<00:00:51.780> barriers<00:00:51.989> so<00:00:52.230> your<00:00:52.379> maneuverability

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
through barriers so your maneuverability

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.180 
through barriers so your maneuverability
is<00:00:53.100> limited<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.579> so<00:00:54.329> here<00:00:55.020> I<00:00:55.320> see<00:00:55.710> this<00:00:55.829> turret

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
is limited and so here I see this turret

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.069 
is limited and so here I see this turret
so<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.399> get<00:00:56.670> on<00:00:56.730> my<00:00:56.760> Gorgon<00:00:57.149> which<00:00:57.840> means

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
so I get on my Gorgon which means

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.479 
so I get on my Gorgon which means
mccleave<00:00:58.469> is<00:00:58.590> now<00:00:58.710> disappeared<00:00:59.129> because<00:00:59.250> in

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
mccleave is now disappeared because in

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.340 
mccleave is now disappeared because in
beast<00:00:59.670> mode<00:00:59.760> you<00:00:59.969> can't<00:01:00.149> pick<00:01:00.300> up<00:01:00.390> weapons<00:01:00.570> now

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
beast mode you can't pick up weapons now

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.500 
beast mode you can't pick up weapons now
this<00:01:01.620> first<00:01:02.160> tier<00:01:02.460> savage<00:01:02.789> Grenadier<00:01:03.120> costs

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
this first tier savage Grenadier costs

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.050 
this first tier savage Grenadier costs
450<00:01:04.350> so<00:01:04.589> not<00:01:04.799> much<00:01:04.920> andis<00:01:05.489> goggles<00:01:05.549> really

powerful<00:01:06.390> actually<00:01:06.630> it's<00:01:07.049> really<00:01:07.170> useful<00:01:07.380> and

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
powerful actually it's really useful and

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.350 
powerful actually it's really useful and
the<00:01:08.220> clip<00:01:08.430> is<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.580> bit<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.760> a<00:01:08.820> gimmick<00:01:09.060> but<00:01:09.240> it's

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
the clip is a bit of a gimmick but it's

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.000 
the clip is a bit of a gimmick but it's
useful<00:01:09.510> for<00:01:09.630> getting<00:01:09.810> through<00:01:09.990> barriers<00:01:10.260> so<00:01:10.979> I

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
useful for getting through barriers so I

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.679 
useful for getting through barriers so I
yeah<00:01:11.729> this<00:01:11.880> Gorgon<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.450> good<00:01:12.570> thing

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.540 
costs a lot he's 4000 this one so it
really<00:02:51.959> is<00:02:52.050> costly<00:02:52.440> but<00:02:52.590> you<00:02:52.800> can<00:02:52.950> you<00:02:53.310> can<00:02:53.430> get

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
really is costly but you can you can get

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.760 
really is costly but you can you can get
some<00:02:53.760> so<00:02:54.120> many<00:02:54.300> kills<00:02:54.480> with<00:02:54.630> this<00:02:54.720> guy<00:02:54.870> a<00:02:55.110> good

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
some so many kills with this guy a good

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.260 
some so many kills with this guy a good
trick<00:02:56.010> is<00:02:56.130> to<00:02:56.160> either<00:02:56.310> use<00:02:56.640> your<00:02:56.790> grenade<00:02:56.880> and

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
trick is to either use your grenade and

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.510 
trick is to either use your grenade and
then<00:02:57.450> talk<00:02:57.780> bow<00:02:57.990> the<00:02:58.170> downed<00:02:58.380> people<00:02:58.800> or<00:02:58.980> vice

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
then talk bow the downed people or vice

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.920 
then talk bow the downed people or vice
versa<00:02:59.820> top<00:03:00.090> of<00:03:00.270> them<00:03:00.390> down<00:03:00.540> then<00:03:00.720> threw<00:03:00.870> a

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
versa top of them down then threw a

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.510 
versa top of them down then threw a
grenade<00:03:01.080> and<00:03:01.440> you<00:03:01.740> get<00:03:01.920> a<00:03:01.950> lot<00:03:02.130> of<00:03:02.160> kills<00:03:02.370> that

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
grenade and you get a lot of kills that

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.790 
grenade and you get a lot of kills that
way<00:03:02.670> because<00:03:02.880> you<00:03:03.870> always<00:03:04.020> end<00:03:04.500> up<00:03:04.590> down<00:03:04.770> in

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
way because you always end up down in

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.860 
way because you always end up down in
people<00:03:05.190> even<00:03:05.430> with<00:03:05.670> explosives<00:03:06.209> on<00:03:06.540> beast

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
people even with explosives on beast

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.140 
people even with explosives on beast
mode<00:03:07.050> I<00:03:07.310> managed<00:03:08.310> to<00:03:08.370> get<00:03:08.459> a<00:03:08.520> trickshot<00:03:08.790> ribbon

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
mode I managed to get a trickshot ribbon

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.540 
mode I managed to get a trickshot ribbon
with<00:03:09.540> it<00:03:09.690> just<00:03:10.560> in<00:03:10.650> my<00:03:10.680> first<00:03:10.920> game<00:03:11.130> of<00:03:11.280> that<00:03:11.430> as

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
with it just in my first game of that as

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.520 
with it just in my first game of that as
well<00:03:11.670> so<00:03:11.700> if<00:03:12.570> you're<00:03:12.810> working<00:03:13.170> towards<00:03:13.410> that

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
well so if you're working towards that

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:14.570 
well so if you're working towards that
it<00:03:13.620> might<00:03:13.740> be<00:03:13.770> a<00:03:13.890> good<00:03:13.920> time<00:03:14.070> to<00:03:14.190> try<00:03:14.370> and<00:03:14.490> go

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
it might be a good time to try and go

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.430 
it might be a good time to try and go
for<00:03:14.610> that<00:03:14.820> there<00:03:15.090> you<00:03:15.180> go<00:03:15.300> trickshot<00:03:16.140> wasn't

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
for that there you go trickshot wasn't

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.680 
for that there you go trickshot wasn't
too<00:03:16.530> difficult<00:03:16.709> and<00:03:17.040> but<00:03:17.910> yeah<00:03:18.060> he<00:03:18.360> might<00:03:18.480> cost

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
too difficult and but yeah he might cost

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.870 
too difficult and but yeah he might cost
a<00:03:18.810> lot<00:03:18.930> but<00:03:19.130> I'm<00:03:20.130> trying<00:03:20.400> to<00:03:20.489> shoot<00:03:20.610> that<00:03:20.760> guy

favorite now in hold mode this weekend
everyone's<00:03:44.880> got<00:03:45.030> bunny<00:03:45.239> heads<00:03:45.480> which<00:03:45.630> I<00:03:45.720> think

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
everyone's got bunny heads which I think

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.150 
everyone's got bunny heads which I think
some<00:03:46.110> of<00:03:46.140> you<00:03:46.290> might<00:03:46.380> remember<00:03:46.530> from<00:03:46.739> the<00:03:46.980> beta

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
some of you might remember from the beta

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.160 
some of you might remember from the beta
and<00:03:47.459> but<00:03:48.180> obviously<00:03:48.420> that's<00:03:48.570> Easter<00:03:48.840> weekend

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
classic called so it's a throwback to

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.650 
classic called so it's a throwback to
gears<00:03:55.500> to<00:03:55.769> that<00:03:56.519> means<00:03:56.730> there<00:03:57.030> are<00:03:57.120> no<00:03:57.239> savage

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
gears to that means there are no savage

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.960 
gears to that means there are no savage
no<00:03:58.019> lumban<00:03:58.440> there<00:03:58.860> aren't<00:03:59.010> any<00:03:59.070> bases<00:03:59.340> there

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
no lumban there aren't any bases there

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.600 
no lumban there aren't any bases there
are<00:04:00.060> no<00:04:00.150> fortifications<00:04:01.070> map<00:04:02.070> based<00:04:02.250> weapons

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
are no fortifications map based weapons

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:03.680 
are no fortifications map based weapons
don't<00:04:02.820> cost<00:04:02.970> something<00:04:03.150> you<00:04:03.300> can<00:04:03.420> just<00:04:03.450> pick

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
don't cost something you can just pick

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.729 
don't cost something you can just pick
them<00:04:03.870> up<00:04:03.959> you<00:04:04.620> can't<00:04:04.920> buy<00:04:05.100> back<00:04:05.280> when<00:04:06.090> you<00:04:06.209> die

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
them up you can't buy back when you die

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:09.350 
them up you can't buy back when you die
and<00:04:07.739> it's<00:04:07.950> got<00:04:08.250> up<00:04:08.340> gears<00:04:08.550> to<00:04:08.790> wave<00:04:09.030> structure

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
and it's got up gears to wave structure

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.509 
and it's got up gears to wave structure
as<00:04:09.540> well<00:04:09.570> so<00:04:10.019> although<00:04:10.890> there<00:04:11.250> aren't<00:04:11.340> any

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
as well so although there aren't any

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.190 
as well so although there aren't any
sides<00:04:11.760> or<00:04:12.180> anything<00:04:12.209> like<00:04:12.510> that<00:04:12.660> from<00:04:12.930> gears

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
sides or anything like that from gears

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.050 
sides or anything like that from gears
two<00:04:13.350> they<00:04:13.500> haven't<00:04:13.680> brought<00:04:13.830> in<00:04:14.010> new<00:04:14.430> and<00:04:14.730> new

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
two they haven't brought in new and new

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.849 
two they haven't brought in new and new
enemies<00:04:15.360> it<00:04:16.229> follows<00:04:16.470> the<00:04:16.560> more<00:04:16.680> progressive

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
enemies it follows the more progressive

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:20.599 
enemies it follows the more progressive
path<00:04:17.370> of<00:04:17.700> hard<00:04:18.540> n<00:04:18.840> gears<00:04:19.320> two<00:04:19.530> rather<00:04:20.400> than<00:04:20.489> to

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
path of hard n gears two rather than to

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.790 
path of hard n gears two rather than to
give<00:04:20.760> give<00:04:21.239> 3<00:04:21.419> structure<00:04:21.780> so<00:04:22.200> here<00:04:22.710> I'm

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
give give 3 structure so here I'm

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.740 
give give 3 structure so here I'm
showing<00:04:22.950> I<00:04:23.280> died<00:04:23.490> and<00:04:23.820> then<00:04:24.390> when<00:04:24.539> you<00:04:24.600> go<00:04:24.690> to

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
showing I died and then when you go to

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.150 
showing I died and then when you go to
the<00:04:24.900> buyback<00:04:25.229> screen<00:04:25.590> where<00:04:25.890> it<00:04:25.919> would

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
the buyback screen where it would

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.530 
the buyback screen where it would
normally<00:04:26.430> let<00:04:26.550> you<00:04:26.640> buy<00:04:26.760> back<00:04:26.940> in

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
normally let you buy back in

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
normally let you buy back in
cost<00:04:27.840> is<00:04:29.090> 999999<00:04:30.090> dollars<00:04:30.480> so<00:04:30.840> one<00:04:31.170> shy<00:04:31.380> of<00:04:31.440> a

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
cost is 999999 dollars so one shy of a

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.680 
cost is 999999 dollars so one shy of a
million<00:04:31.830> which<00:04:32.070> obviously<00:04:32.370> is<00:04:33.210> impossible<00:04:33.660> to

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:33.690 
million which obviously is impossible to

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.580 
million which obviously is impossible to
accumulate<00:04:34.200> so<00:04:34.890> there<00:04:35.430> is<00:04:35.520> no<00:04:35.670> buyback<00:04:36.000> and

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
accumulate so there is no buyback and

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
accumulate so there is no buyback and
you<00:04:37.590> actually<00:04:37.740> to<00:04:38.040> show<00:04:38.160> you<00:04:38.220> this<00:04:38.340> clip

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
you actually to show you this clip

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:39.830 
you actually to show you this clip
because<00:04:38.730> I<00:04:39.000> was<00:04:39.120> enjoying<00:04:39.360> a<00:04:39.510> game<00:04:39.630> of<00:04:39.750> this

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
because I was enjoying a game of this

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.540 
because I was enjoying a game of this
hold<00:04:40.050> earlier<00:04:40.350> seen<00:04:40.860> how<00:04:40.980> far<00:04:41.190> I<00:04:41.220> could<00:04:41.370> get

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
hold earlier seen how far I could get

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.970 
hold earlier seen how far I could get
and<00:04:41.730> I<00:04:42.570> don't<00:04:43.080> think<00:04:43.230> we<00:04:43.290> have<00:04:43.410> the<00:04:43.500> best<00:04:43.530> host

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
and I don't think we have the best host

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.830 
and I don't think we have the best host
as<00:04:44.190> you'll<00:04:44.370> see<00:04:44.490> here<00:04:44.700> a<00:04:44.910> ticker<00:04:45.420> goes<00:04:45.630> down

as you'll see here a ticker goes down

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.230 
as you'll see here a ticker goes down
towards<00:04:46.200> the<00:04:46.230> right<00:04:46.610> gets<00:04:47.610> the<00:04:47.700> guy<00:04:47.820> down<00:04:48.000> so
