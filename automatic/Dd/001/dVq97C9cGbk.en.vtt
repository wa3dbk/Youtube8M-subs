00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
think of where to run your Airlines that

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.180 
think of where to run your Airlines that
we're<00:00:48.870> here<00:00:49.050> at<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.230> ass<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.620> car<00:00:49.829> because

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
we're here at the ass of the car because

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.279 
we're here at the ass of the car because
our<00:00:50.430> air<00:00:50.670> box<00:00:50.700> it's<00:00:51.210> in<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.570> trunk<00:00:51.780> basically

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
our air box it's in the trunk basically

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.860 
our air box it's in the trunk basically
so<00:00:52.530> what<00:00:53.489> we've<00:00:53.670> done<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:54.030> we<00:00:54.180> decided<00:00:54.600> split

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
so what we've done is we decided split

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.779 
so what we've done is we decided split
lines<00:00:55.140> from<00:00:55.530> left<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:55.949> right<00:00:56.160> side<00:00:56.430> why

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
lines from left to right side why

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.520 
lines from left to right side why
because<00:00:57.180> this<00:00:57.329> is<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.570> four-wheel-drive<00:00:58.050> car

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
because this is a four-wheel-drive car

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.680 
because this is a four-wheel-drive car
you<00:00:59.250> want<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.460> stay<00:00:59.609> away<00:00:59.820> from<00:00:59.879> moving<00:01:00.420> parts

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
you want to stay away from moving parts

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.619 
you want to stay away from moving parts
like<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.170> driveshaft<00:01:01.410> or<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.070> drive<00:01:02.280> train

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
like the driveshaft or the drive train

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.660 
like the driveshaft or the drive train
stuff<00:01:03.629> like<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.170> exhaust<00:01:04.769> where<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.250> gets<00:01:05.460> hot

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
stuff like the exhaust where it gets hot

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.730 
stuff like the exhaust where it gets hot
to<00:01:05.880> one<00:01:06.000> stay<00:01:06.210> away<00:01:06.360> from<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.659> too<00:01:06.869> we<00:01:07.590> took

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
to one stay away from that too we took

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.710 
to one stay away from that too we took
it<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:07.950> step<00:01:07.979> further<00:01:08.430> by<00:01:08.610> using<00:01:08.790> plastic

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
it a step further by using plastic

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.109 
it a step further by using plastic
insulator<00:01:10.170> wire<00:01:10.530> which<00:01:10.979> goes<00:01:11.250> over<00:01:12.090> our

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
insulator wire which goes over our

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.270 
insulator wire which goes over our
airlines<00:01:12.780> so<00:01:13.080> this<00:01:13.320> protects<00:01:13.710> the<00:01:13.860> airline

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
airlines so this protects the airline

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.140 
airlines so this protects the airline
per<00:01:14.520> se<00:01:14.760> from<00:01:15.299> any<00:01:16.080> serious<00:01:16.560> damage<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.189> what

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
per se from any serious damage and what

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.330 
per se from any serious damage and what
we've<00:01:18.299> done<00:01:18.450> is<00:01:18.689> we've<00:01:18.930> run<00:01:19.259> these<00:01:19.830> plastic

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
we've done is we've run these plastic

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.340 
we've done is we've run these plastic
clips<00:01:20.549> throughout<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.000> chassis<00:01:21.420> where<00:01:22.020> we

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
clips throughout the chassis where we

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.200 
clips throughout the chassis where we
can<00:01:22.530> zip<00:01:22.770> tie<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.009> lines<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.610> keep<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.030> clean

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
can zip tie the lines and keep it clean

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.030 
can zip tie the lines and keep it clean
and<00:01:24.450> keep<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:24.780> away<00:01:24.869> from<00:01:25.049> anything<00:01:25.799> that

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
and keep it away from anything that

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.830 
and keep it away from anything that
would<00:01:26.220> scrape<00:01:26.580> or<00:01:26.880> anything<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.479> would

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
would scrape or anything that would

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.260 
would scrape or anything that would
puncture<00:01:28.439> it<00:01:28.710> because<00:01:29.070> having<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.880> hole<00:01:30.060> in

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
puncture it because having a hole in

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.940 
puncture it because having a hole in
your<00:01:30.390> airline<00:01:30.810> it's<00:01:31.140> not<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.350> good<00:01:31.590> thing<00:01:31.770> when

so<00:01:57.680> we<00:01:57.770> actually<00:01:57.920> have<00:01:58.190> a<00:01:58.220> person<00:01:58.580> in<00:01:58.670> the

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
so we actually have a person in the

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.900 
so we actually have a person in the
trunk<00:01:59.030> now<00:01:59.210> doing<00:01:59.960> the<00:02:00.140> bolts<00:02:00.560> on<00:02:00.710> top<00:02:00.910> it

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 
trunk now doing the bolts on top it

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.230 
trunk now doing the bolts on top it
helps<00:02:02.270> us<00:02:02.420> with<00:02:02.450> our<00:02:03.050> movie<00:02:03.320> magic<00:02:04.240> so

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
helps us with our movie magic so

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.600 
helps us with our movie magic so
basically<00:02:05.630> we've<00:02:06.020> set<00:02:06.590> our<00:02:06.860> coil<00:02:07.250> overs<00:02:07.580> to

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
basically we've set our coil overs to

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.160 
basically we've set our coil overs to
the<00:02:07.940> lowest<00:02:08.270> possible<00:02:08.450> setting<00:02:08.869> because

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
the lowest possible setting because

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.460 
the lowest possible setting because
we're<00:02:09.530> down<00:02:09.830> to<00:02:10.009> earth<00:02:10.130> people<00:02:11.110> so<00:02:12.110> after

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
we're down to earth people so after

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.890 
we're down to earth people so after
doing<00:02:12.680> all<00:02:12.920> that<00:02:13.160> you<00:02:13.520> literally<00:02:14.060> simply<00:02:14.630> hook

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
doing all that you literally simply hook

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.260 
doing all that you literally simply hook
up<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.200> airline<00:02:15.700> strap<00:02:16.700> it<00:02:16.850> in<00:02:16.970> so<00:02:17.120> that<00:02:17.150> it

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
up the airline strap it in so that it

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.540 
up the airline strap it in so that it
doesn't<00:02:17.630> shave<00:02:17.930> or<00:02:18.260> scrape<00:02:18.770> on<00:02:18.920> anything<00:02:19.160> and

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
doesn't shave or scrape on anything and

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.020 
doesn't shave or scrape on anything and
then<00:02:20.000> you're<00:02:20.150> done<00:02:20.300> how<00:02:21.290> easy<00:02:21.530> was<00:02:21.709> it<00:02:22.030> so

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
then you're done how easy was it so

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.550 
then you're done how easy was it so
after<00:02:23.180> installing<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:23.780> airline's<00:02:24.260> the

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
after installing the airline's the

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.530 
after installing the airline's the
shocks<00:02:24.890> we're<00:02:25.370> now<00:02:25.489> in<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:25.730> final<00:02:26.090> step<00:02:26.330> which

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
shocks we're now in the final step which

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.360 
shocks we're now in the final step which
is<00:02:26.570> the<00:02:26.780> air<00:02:26.900> box<00:02:27.140> so<00:02:27.410> the<00:02:27.530> air<00:02:27.620> box<00:02:27.770> obviously

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
is the air box so the air box obviously

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.160 
is the air box so the air box obviously
goes<00:02:28.520> into<00:02:28.730> your<00:02:28.820> trunk<00:02:29.060> we've<00:02:29.630> routed<00:02:29.930> the

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
goes into your trunk we've routed the

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.900 
goes into your trunk we've routed the
air<00:02:30.350> line<00:02:30.590> so<00:02:30.830> that<00:02:30.980> it<00:02:31.100> comes<00:02:31.370> out<00:02:31.520> here

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
air line so that it comes out here

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.479 
air line so that it comes out here
through<00:02:32.150> the<00:02:32.300> side<00:02:32.510> now<00:02:33.200> it's<00:02:33.920> as<00:02:34.100> easy<00:02:34.310> as

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
through the side now it's as easy as

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.460 
through the side now it's as easy as
connecting<00:02:35.150> the<00:02:35.720> positive<00:02:36.230> and<00:02:36.380> a<00:02:36.440> negative

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
connecting the positive and a negative

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:37.870 
connecting the positive and a negative
which<00:02:36.950> goes<00:02:37.130> straight<00:02:37.280> up<00:02:37.430> to<00:02:37.550> the<00:02:37.700> battery

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
which goes straight up to the battery

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.510 
which goes straight up to the battery
don't<00:02:38.540> forget<00:02:38.930> to<00:02:39.080> fuse<00:02:39.440> your<00:02:39.470> positive<00:02:40.310> line

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
don't forget to fuse your positive line

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.580 
don't forget to fuse your positive line
and<00:02:40.790> then<00:02:41.209> the<00:02:41.300> for<00:02:41.510> air<00:02:41.690> lines<00:02:41.930> using<00:02:42.410> the

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
and then the for air lines using the

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.050 
and then the for air lines using the
quick<00:02:42.830> connectors<00:02:43.250> and<00:02:43.459> then<00:02:43.670> you're<00:02:43.850> done

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
quick connectors and then you're done

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.570 
quick connectors and then you're done
it's<00:02:44.900> the<00:02:45.050> end<00:02:45.230> of<00:02:45.350> the<00:02:45.440> day<00:02:45.620> and<00:02:45.860> this<00:02:46.160> is<00:02:46.400> what

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
it's the end of the day and this is what
