00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.230
 Hello UTB lg g3 big and beautiful 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.460
 Korean flagship 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:16.029
 g3 has a display resolution of 2560 on 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.739
 1440 snapdragon 801 2 or 3 gigabytes 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:20.140
 RAM depending on 

00:00:17.739 --> 00:00:22.119
 countries the phone itself looks cool yes 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.069
 in-he is really very cool 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.829
 Looks like the first feeling when you take g3 

00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:28.989
 ease having such a huge display and 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:31.419
 body more than the jet you do not care 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:33.220
 lighter than predecessor case material 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:35.200
 ordinary plastic but it looks like 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.330
 metal plastic textured 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.860
 and no longer as sleek glossy as this 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.320
 was the case with gg2 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.270
 although the concept of the g phone has remained so 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.080
 there was no frontal stone 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:46.510
 no buttons 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.550
 they are behind only now not bulging a 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.770
 the power button became round and around it 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.340
 LED-lights disappeared as it was in lg 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.590
 g2 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.390
 Someone like this option someone in 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.400
 to the rage of the inconvenience I personally have 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.810
 button layout doesn't like it but 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.480
 certainly a matter of habit 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.370
 g3 got a 55 inch screen 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.920
 it's half an inch larger than g2 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:09.280
 at the same time, the novelty has become thinner than 8 and 9 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.869
 mm versus 9 and 14 in g2 and g3 with 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.909
 so really big display 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.259
 hands don't feel like a shovel he 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:16.689
 a bit more nexus 5 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:18.490
 the frame around the display is very small and it is 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:20.020
 at the expense of the Koreans came in 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.539
 literally cram that 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.999
 competent display main plus g3 is 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:26.380
 ergonomics compared to galaxy s5 van 

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:29.439
 plus xperia z2 van 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:32.020
 and features of sevan m8 it looks like 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:33.969
 size similar device but just at 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.009
 elji is such a big display 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:38.079
 she already si si van at all now ashamed 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.850
 watch from this model case on 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:41.950
 the device is removable under it is 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.950
 connector for flash card, he is still here 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.509
 and the micro-sim battery is bigger now 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.969
 it's 3000 milliampere hours 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.499
 g2 was famous for its excellent battery 

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:52.119
 after all, it was this apparatus that held 

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:55.689
 about two times better than the same 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.289
 nexus 5 or sgs4 g3 shows the same 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:58.299
 result 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:59.979
 no it's a big plus back on 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:02.409
 opposite side of the flash 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.880
 there was something else this laser like on 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.770
 almost any digital soap dish 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.959
 it helps to instantly focus 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.119
 what's interesting is laser autofocus worth and 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:11.590
 front therefore self-gunners or 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.510
 in another way, links can be made 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.250
 faster this thing works 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.840
 really fast camera in g3 by 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.269
 the quality is not much different from the same 2 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.739
 because the sensor remained the same 13 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:23.439
 megapixels allows you to do quite 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:25.209
 good pictures but the meaning is still 

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:27.099
 and in optical stabilization inside 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.319
 worth a special motor is not it yet 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.510
 the only phone is mine along with g2 with 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.760
 such a thing that is shaking the video will be 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.739
 markedly reduced due to this a video 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.950
 here it is almost a skate and slow 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:42.310
 shooting 120 fps and ultra hd resolution 4k 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:45.849
 view 4k video on screen 2560 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:48.489
 1440 points obviously fun turn 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:50.680
 in time for the sweetest to screen it 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:53.139
 really the coolest screen among 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.040
 All currently existing flagships is 

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:57.340
 two and a half to 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.950
 and a huge pi pi ah 538 dpi 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.079
 the screen is very sharp and bright there is no 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.030
 what claims he is perfect but it is still 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:05.769
 not all the same finally thinking about changing 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.109
 interface as fashion follows 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:10.659
 g3 got flat design has become much 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:13.120
 better than before but absolutely certain 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:15.519
 it looks terrible now and the shell is very 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.799
 frightening is still not beautiful this of course 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:20.019
 more like android 4 4 but by 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:22.810
 compared to the beautiful nexus 5 interface 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:24.699
 incomparably but this interface has 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.560
 your chips let's say in not so google 

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:28.660
 to the left of the main screen here 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.370
 there is a window with the program tracker and 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.769
 g3 usage tips 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.629
 There is another interesting thing with the keyboard 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:36.760
 You can customize its size for yourself 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:38.949
 pretty cool feature that doesn't 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.319
 would prevent the standard android itself 

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:43.449
 The keyboard is very convenient by the way and I have 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:45.190
 in the hands of the prerelease version of g3 she is not 

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:47.709
 works very smoothly but not even 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.690
 doubt this will fix because g2 in 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.519
 your time did the same thing now 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.980
 works much faster than many flagships 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:56.409
 nominal raw software antutu shows 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.799
 not the best result of only 30 thousand 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:58.690
 points 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:00.430
 Well, and secondly, I hold in my hand version with 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.650
 two gigabytes of ram 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.049
 they are with three as we would like and thirdly 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.329
 the shell is still heavy and takes away 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:09.340
 much of the power what are we 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:10.810
 we will wait we will wait for g3 when 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.690
 going on sale will be faster 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.099
 work we will wait for the optimization of games and 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.560
 programs for such a high resolution 

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:19.810
 because watch videos and sit in without 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.459
 such a screen is great well and more 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.030
 all i think we will wait for play 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.400
 edition version lg 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.630
 and after all with naked android this is a dream phone 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.000
 with great design 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.720
 great screen and capacious battery all 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.720
 like that
