 Talk a little about the importance of 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.789
 the brushes as I choose a brush 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.390
 let's start with the basics a 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.399
 brush to untangle the hair 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:38.160
 it would be these that are from the brand of 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.870
 philips these brushes what are they going to 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.719
 to do is to untangle the hair 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.180
 Like combing it, do not cut it because you 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.390
 there are very thin hair that sometimes 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.800
 tend to break with brushes this 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.960
 is what he is going to do is protect you 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.120
 hair untangle you and comb it 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.579
 very well apart from that it comes to you from the 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.190
 root to the tips the next thing would be 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.719
 a brush for dry hair that does not 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.080
 leave me frizz I know that at the time of 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.120
 brush me do not leave me like that 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.250
 sponge brushes advances 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.820
 natural that can also help you 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.710
 the same thing that all this brand would be already 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.870
 It also handles tastes to 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.960
 sizes and type of hair too 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:21.690
 this natural bristle brush and makes 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.010
 that my hair is not going to have that much 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.840
 frizz 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.330
 apart from that it gives a natural shine to the 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.790
 hair and how true is it that this 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.580
 type brushes their hair does not break 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.580
 take out less orzuela as I said these 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.860
 brushes if it can be true because 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.990
 that come from natural bristle do not harm you 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.450
 as much as he what the sow would be 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.960
 synthetic that sometimes is like that tends to 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.030
 to cut the hair and there are people who do not 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.610
 they know how to drive and sometimes they have the same 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.800
 to get entangled in this for the dryer what 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.050
 that we recommend is the sow 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.570
 natural or what would be the ones that already 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.180
 contain pottery are this is a 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.400
 thermal brush yes because they contain 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.970
 pottery and this is what he is going to do is 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:10.060
 define t well you your tips and you're going to 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:12.250
 give this also a very good laceado 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.020
 will protect you because at the same time 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.880
 that the heat absorbs you 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.620
 protect by ceramics for example 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.410
 this kind of brushes that are here 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.120
 what are they for? 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.120
 that girls swims pigtails that 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.280
 times then it is difficult then what 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.470
 contains it 's natural bristle that what's going 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.209
 to do is not to hurt the hair and the 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.760
 synthetic bristles what is going to be 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.709
 that pull the hair so that it is then 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.650
 the pigtail very well and you recommend me to 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.790
 the crepe to fix the crepe would be in 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.750
 this type of services 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:47.390
 that come so clear that if this the 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.969
 Look stylists use all chavos 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.489
 girls when they make crepes and I also think 

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:55.250
 that being a stone both the hair 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:57.829
 Exactly because it's not synthetic bristles 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.950
 but it is also true not 100% 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:02.780
 natural but it has been for example 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.620
 to me had told me that 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:10.159
 brushes that have metal are better for 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:12.560
 the dryer yes because the metal ones 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:14.209
 what they do is absorb the heat then 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.590
 at the same time that they absorb the heat 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:20.989
 They give a good drying and give it a good 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.150
 definition to your hairstyle and study for 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:26.269
 what is it that beats me that with this it combed 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.909
 and fluff my dog I have one 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:33.220
 similar to my puppies so they are 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:33.220
 this is handled for the extensions 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:40.430
 as they do not come subject to something firm to 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.340
 Sometimes they tend that if we 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.230
 we put a brush of these or some 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.240
 of these are going to pull the hair 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.180
 apart I'm seeing that they have like 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:52.580
 little dots that is so you do not get hooked 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.770
 in the extensions true exactly 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.750
 so you can untangle them well for 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.970
 that you can comb them and like when 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.130
 you already have them in your hair and 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:04.070
 avoid that you get to go with 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:07.250
 everything and the extension then this is going to 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:09.410
 enter your hair and the extension 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.450
 but it's going to allow you to untangle yourself how good 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.370
 without pulling you what other brush me 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.160
 you want to comment on all the variety that 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.630
 you have here that it 's worth it 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:20.330
 mention or what would you recommend if I 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.760
 I would recommend a lot would this brand be 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:25.880
 it's vortex these brushes are made of 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:28.760
 ceramics what they do is equal they serve you 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.280
 to iron good to do it in what 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:34.130
 that would be the same glaze to define 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.920
 tips are handled several sizes too 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.120
 and this is what it has is that what 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.940
 what would he be 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.710
 natural pig that will give you shine and 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.389
 apart from the same, it will also define you 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.250
 very well any type of hairstyle that 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:48.290
 you want and I feel that one so 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.630
 chubby like this can help you 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:52.880
 also very much to what has been 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.400
 that the hair is lacie fast 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.550
 exactly nothing if they want to do fast 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.600
 to finish with a chubby one and truth this 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.580
 works 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.949
 and good Cristie Kerr is a charm me 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.389
 it's helped a lot and you know 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:08.330
 that all these brushes do not 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:10.250
 They are in salt and it 's worth it because 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:13.130
 if we use the right thing of the pools in 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:16.030
 our hair looks better looks better and 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:16.030
 what we most want
