00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 also welcome back to my channel 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.069
 that short I'm going to show you how 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.779
 try without your flight controller 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.269
 it works in this case is that we're going to 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.740
 use the 3d cc flight controller 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.679
 you can see here this is the version 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.160
 atom is to say the small version this 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.600
 has a different usb connector from the 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.550
 that he had the other flight controller 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.980
 that a little bit bigger this connector 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.170
 is the similar to that used for 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.930
 connect our cell phones and I have a 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.099
 cellular cable here I already entered and by the 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.890
 other side 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:35.520
 usb this is a cellular data cable 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:38.010
 then already having that cable what 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.640
 we can do is move to download the 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.550
 3d ss application then let's go and 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.489
 we enter our computer 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.899
 as seen below in the 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.130
 screenshot that I'm going to show you 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:55.010
 then go to google 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:59.240
 train in google and write to him 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:02.750
 google open pilot 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:05.720
 and ready here appears at the beginning is open 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.150
 pilot point now enter here and then 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.550
 they are here and not profile or what they are going to 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:14.120
 do is 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:17.840
 enter the option that says docs and 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:21.290
 software here where I have the mouse to 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:24.950
 software downloads and here very important 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:28.190
 do not download the latest version the last 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:31.760
 version does not work cc3 of I do not know why 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.950
 here a release 15.5 to nana spread and 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.800
 here perfectly says that they are not 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.690
 supported s3d that have to go to the 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.300
 version 15 0 2 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:44.600
 so low do not click there and here 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:48.440
 we have version 15 02 they click 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:52.310
 file download weighs about 65 megabytes 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:55.270
 and this I will have already downloaded here 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.270
 have installed 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:05.550
 read language next accept the terms 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:09.820
 next install we aspire to install 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:12.800
 good and I just installed you both next 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.750
 install I do not know what it was 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.020
 we talked nexus that already everything what we 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.020
 say 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:24.780
 ready the king finish blackberry 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.510
 finish and the one here automatically is going to 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.360
 run the open pilot besides showing me 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.600
 that rhythm then let's minimize 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.250
 all this here wait for you to load open 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.950
 pilot 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:42.370
 here already started pilot 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.040
 and right now what we 're going to do is like 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.000
 can see below 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.040
 how is going to rise here a little bit the 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.410
 screen because you see that then 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:53.140
 what happens the screen 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:57.090
 I'm going to connect with the usb well to 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.090
 computer in the flight controller 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:05.530
 normally the first time it does not detect it 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:09.430
 and we have to disconnect it and 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:13.660
 connect it if I get it detected without 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:18.000
 no problem let's see here some 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.000
 rx rx lights 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:24.030
 and let's see if it detects it or I do not think 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:27.750
 who detected it without any problem 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:30.720
 here we have the flight controller with 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.430
 all your lights on then what 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.270
 What I'm going to do here is enter here 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:39.010
 where it says flight data 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:41.610
 income fly tata and here I realize 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:46.410
 if I move 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:52.010
 the controller in this case I do not have no 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:52.010
 has detected it let's go to here connect 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:06.350
 well not detected then we go 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.350
 here to the firmware to see 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.400
 normally when he detects it 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.739
 it automatically shows me information 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.989
 of the flight controller in this case not 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:22.230
 he did here what I can do is 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:24.420
 connect and disconnect 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:26.220
 flight controller to the usb to see if what 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:29.610
 they detect this time 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.790
 who disconnects one connected another 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.790
 time 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:43.510
 right now and then I detect how they can 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:48.450
 see on screen 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:51.730
 here he tells me that he is the firmware is 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:54.720
 updated male ok and come on we can see 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.720
 here if I move 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:00.070
 let's see this here at a point 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.960
 static 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.530
 it's a little crazy I love to give it 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.530
 disconnect 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.350
 and connect 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:14.060
 is a little crazy then what 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:17.689
 we have to do here is update the 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:20.679
 operating system then let's frame 

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:20.679
 let's give it 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:29.170
 We are to work 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.170
 if you let it update 

00:06:08.689 --> 00:06:15.469
 well since the board has been updated to 

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:18.229
 last operating system by very so 

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:19.849
 I'm going back here to flight data to see 

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:21.589
 If everything is fine, cut me the 

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:26.089
 quadrocopters is not on screen like 

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:28.429
 crazy if I move it to be able to see that 

00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:30.529
 there is an adequate response from 

00:06:28.429 --> 00:06:33.829
 flight controller 

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:38.379
 in this case he's going to put it in here on 

00:06:33.829 --> 00:06:38.379
 the table and you see that it's level 

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:44.270
 if I move it everything works as it should 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.680
 do so that's basically everything 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:47.750
 what to do is a little bit from 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.940
 long the procedure to test 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:52.700
 our flight controller but what 

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:56.570
 general is to download the open pilot the 

00:06:52.700 --> 00:07:01.550
 version that supports the cc 3 that the 15 

00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:05.930
 0 2 1 0 1 and then connect the 

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:07.760
 flight controller to the computer the 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:09.950
 first time it comes out to the drivers like this 

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:12.290
 that will not work after 

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:14.390
 they detect it they connect it and it disconnects 

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:17.720
 and then they have to update the 

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:19.790
 frank firmware william upgrade 

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:22.550
 and racing 

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:25.550
 or update and ready, your 

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:28.450
 flight controller for the steps 

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:31.820
 following that are your configuration and 

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:33.890
