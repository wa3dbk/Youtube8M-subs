of<00:00:06.850> new<00:00:07.060> net<00:00:07.390> TV<00:00:07.810> tests<00:00:08.170> to<00:00:08.380> our<00:00:08.410> regular<00:00:08.889> test

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:09.129 
of new net TV tests to our regular test

00:00:09.129 --> 00:00:10.980 
of new net TV tests to our regular test
program<00:00:09.520> and<00:00:09.730> as<00:00:10.240> part<00:00:10.510> of<00:00:10.570> that<00:00:10.719> we've<00:00:10.870> been

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:10.990 
program and as part of that we've been

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.110 
program and as part of that we've been
looking<00:00:11.110> at<00:00:11.290> this<00:00:11.410> Panasonic<00:00:12.070> TV<00:00:12.520> now

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:13.120 
looking at this Panasonic TV now

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.879 
looking at this Panasonic TV now
Panasonic<00:00:13.780> uses<00:00:14.080> a<00:00:14.110> system<00:00:14.290> called<00:00:14.440> VIERA

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:14.889 
Panasonic uses a system called VIERA

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:16.499 
Panasonic uses a system called VIERA
CAST<00:00:15.219> which<00:00:15.490> is<00:00:15.610> pc<00:00:15.820> their<00:00:16.029> version<00:00:16.420> of

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:16.509 
CAST which is pc their version of

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:18.859 
CAST which is pc their version of
connecting<00:00:17.140> to<00:00:17.230> the<00:00:17.349> internet<00:00:17.380> so<00:00:17.860> your<00:00:18.040> telly

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
connecting to the internet so your telly

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.330 
connecting to the internet so your telly
what<00:00:19.869> do<00:00:19.930> we<00:00:20.050> think<00:00:20.290> of<00:00:20.349> it<00:00:20.500> well<00:00:20.980> as<00:00:21.130> you<00:00:21.189> can

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:21.340 
what do we think of it well as you can

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.159 
what do we think of it well as you can
see<00:00:21.610> the<00:00:21.790> interfaces<00:00:22.390> looks<00:00:22.689> a<00:00:22.779> little<00:00:22.930> bit

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:23.169 
see the interfaces looks a little bit

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:25.440 
see the interfaces looks a little bit
odd<00:00:23.349> we<00:00:24.250> can<00:00:24.369> cycle<00:00:24.579> through<00:00:24.759> here<00:00:25.149> and

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:25.450 
odd we can cycle through here and

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:26.909 
odd we can cycle through here and
basically<00:00:25.899> you've<00:00:26.050> got<00:00:26.079> all<00:00:26.290> your<00:00:26.410> apps<00:00:26.619> on

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:26.919 
basically you've got all your apps on

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:28.999 
basically you've got all your apps on
the<00:00:27.040> top<00:00:27.250> layer<00:00:27.430> here<00:00:27.669> and<00:00:28.059> then<00:00:28.660> you<00:00:28.779> can<00:00:28.840> go

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:29.009 
the top layer here and then you can go

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:32.339 
the top layer here and then you can go
and<00:00:30.009> see<00:00:30.189> more<00:00:30.489> apps<00:00:30.700> below<00:00:31.630> that<00:00:31.809> and<00:00:32.020> more

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:32.349 
and see more apps below that and more

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:34.740 
and see more apps below that and more
apps<00:00:32.529> yet<00:00:32.710> again<00:00:32.980> it's<00:00:33.820> a<00:00:33.880> little<00:00:34.000> bit<00:00:34.149> old<00:00:34.420> a

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:34.750 
apps yet again it's a little bit old a

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.650 
apps yet again it's a little bit old a
little<00:00:35.290> bit<00:00:35.410> hard<00:00:35.649> to<00:00:35.680> get<00:00:35.860> used<00:00:36.100> to<00:00:36.340> and

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
little bit hard to get used to and

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.330 
little bit hard to get used to and
opinion<00:00:37.660> in<00:00:37.840> the<00:00:37.930> lab<00:00:38.110> is<00:00:38.320> split<00:00:38.680> about<00:00:38.980> that

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
opinion in the lab is split about that

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.640 
opinion in the lab is split about that
anyone<00:00:39.670> likes<00:00:39.910> this<00:00:40.180> or<00:00:40.330> not<00:00:40.450> um<00:00:40.690> actually

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
I've got a soft spot for it but it might

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.610 
I've got a soft spot for it but it might
not<00:00:45.250> be<00:00:45.370> everyone's<00:00:45.760> cup<00:00:46.120> of<00:00:46.210> tea<00:00:46.270> in<00:00:46.900> terms<00:00:47.530> of

00:00:59.640 --> 00:00:59.650 
the other net TVs we've looked at video

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:01.880 
the other net TVs we've looked at video
quality<00:00:59.860> is<00:01:00.489> OK

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
unfortunately the the functionality is a

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.330 
unfortunately the the functionality is a
little<00:01:10.060> bit<00:01:10.180> limited<00:01:10.710> usually<00:01:11.710> on<00:01:11.830> most<00:01:12.040> net

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340

which are normally for DVD players to

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.810 
which are normally for DVD players to

not<00:01:22.390> the<00:01:22.540> case<00:01:22.720> with<00:01:22.900> this<00:01:22.990> Panasonic<00:01:23.680> but<00:01:24.520> as

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
not the case with this Panasonic but as

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.640 
not the case with this Panasonic but as
a<00:01:25.090> big<00:01:25.299> plus<00:01:25.540> point<00:01:25.630> you<00:01:25.990> can<00:01:26.110> actually<00:01:26.260> plug

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
a big plus point you can actually plug

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.610 
a big plus point you can actually plug
in<00:01:27.090> keyboard<00:01:28.090> by<00:01:28.360> the<00:01:28.420> USB<00:01:28.750> port<00:01:29.170> or<00:01:29.320> even<00:01:29.530> a

in keyboard by the USB port or even a
wireless<00:01:30.190> keyboard<00:01:30.370> and<00:01:31.240> that<00:01:31.299> makes<00:01:31.570> it

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
wireless keyboard and that makes it

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.020 
wireless keyboard and that makes it
really<00:01:31.870> easy<00:01:32.049> to<00:01:32.470> navigate<00:01:32.620> and<00:01:33.159> use<00:01:33.909> the

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
really easy to navigate and use the

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.390 
really easy to navigate and use the
system<00:01:34.420> that<00:01:34.540> way<00:01:34.830> there's<00:01:35.830> no<00:01:35.890> application

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
system that way there's no application

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.910 
system that way there's no application
store<00:01:37.240> like<00:01:37.659> the<00:01:37.810> Samsung<00:01:38.350> that<00:01:38.530> we've<00:01:38.650> looked

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
store like the Samsung that we've looked

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.820 
store like the Samsung that we've looked
at<00:01:39.299> but<00:01:40.299> it<00:01:40.750> looks<00:01:41.020> like<00:01:41.200> there<00:01:41.350> is<00:01:41.470> room<00:01:41.799> for

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
at but it looks like there is room for

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.500 
at but it looks like there is room for
more<00:01:42.040> apps<00:01:42.369> to<00:01:42.549> be<00:01:42.640> downloaded<00:01:43.210> they'll

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:43.510 
more apps to be downloaded they'll

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.450 
more apps to be downloaded they'll
probably<00:01:43.720> come<00:01:44.049> with<00:01:44.080> software<00:01:44.680> updates<00:01:45.100> but

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
probably come with software updates but

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.950 
probably come with software updates but
there<00:01:45.700> seems<00:01:45.970> to<00:01:46.030> be<00:01:46.150> no<00:01:46.360> way<00:01:46.540> of<00:01:46.690> knowing

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
there seems to be no way of knowing

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.530 
there seems to be no way of knowing
where<00:01:47.320> when<00:01:48.159> they'll<00:01:48.369> appear<00:01:48.729> or<00:01:49.000> what<00:01:49.420> you

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
where when they'll appear or what you

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.469 
where when they'll appear or what you
can<00:01:49.659> download<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:51.250> not<00:01:51.700> the<00:01:51.820> best<00:01:52.060> but<00:01:52.330> we

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
can download so not the best but we

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.480 
can download so not the best but we
certainly<00:01:52.840> seen<00:01:53.080> worse<00:01:53.290> now<00:01:54.159> you<00:01:54.310> want<00:01:54.460> to

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
certainly seen worse now you want to

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.789 
certainly seen worse now you want to
