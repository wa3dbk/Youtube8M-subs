lent itself to a pose just in the

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:11.310 
lent itself to a pose just in the
opening<00:01:09.040> and<00:01:09.190> then<00:01:09.880> what<00:01:10.270> JT<00:01:10.479> did<00:01:10.780> musically

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
opening and then what JT did musically

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.680 
opening and then what JT did musically
and<00:01:11.920> we<00:01:12.100> what<00:01:12.400> we<00:01:12.550> did<00:01:12.729> with<00:01:12.909> the<00:01:12.970> atmospheres

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.170 
and we what we did with the atmospheres
really<00:01:14.470> paid<00:01:14.740> a<00:01:14.770> big<00:01:15.040> dividend<00:01:15.490> I<00:01:15.550> thought<00:01:15.759> it

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
really paid a big dividend I thought it

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.270 
really paid a big dividend I thought it
just<00:01:16.390> was<00:01:16.540> subtle<00:01:16.899> but<00:01:17.110> very<00:01:17.440> precise<00:01:17.890> you

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
just was subtle but very precise you

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:20.999 
just was subtle but very precise you
expect<00:01:18.880> the<00:01:19.119> big<00:01:19.659> action<00:01:19.930> sequence<00:01:20.530> the

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
expect the big action sequence the

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:23.310 
expect the big action sequence the
planes<00:01:21.280> flying<00:01:21.640> around<00:01:21.940> or<00:01:22.330> we<00:01:22.810> have<00:01:22.899> Japanese

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
planes flying around or we have Japanese

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.840 
planes flying around or we have Japanese
zeroes<00:01:23.590> flying<00:01:23.890> around<00:01:24.130> and<00:01:24.280> all<00:01:24.369> that<00:01:24.399> it's

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:24.850 
zeroes flying around and all that it's

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:26.910 
zeroes flying around and all that it's
amazing<00:01:25.479> but<00:01:25.570> what<00:01:25.720> also<00:01:25.840> opens<00:01:26.320> up<00:01:26.530> so

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
amazing but what also opens up so

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.859 
amazing but what also opens up so
beautifully<00:01:27.130> are<00:01:27.640> just<00:01:27.940> the<00:01:28.119> backgrounds<00:01:28.750> and

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:28.869 
beautifully are just the backgrounds and

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:31.139 
beautifully are just the backgrounds and
the<00:01:28.960> atmospheres<00:01:29.530> you<00:01:30.369> know<00:01:30.490> when<00:01:30.729> you're<00:01:30.910> in

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
in that space it feels more realistic

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:41.340

more<00:01:37.840> subtlety<00:01:38.350> that's<00:01:38.920> in<00:01:39.160> it<00:01:39.690> the<00:01:40.690> specific

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
more subtlety that's in it the specific

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.460 
more subtlety that's in it the specific
sounds<00:01:41.860> the<00:01:42.220> more<00:01:42.399> showcases<00:01:43.179> the<00:01:44.080> format

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
sounds the more showcases the format

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.529
