I get you to pull them into the middle

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.149 
I get you to pull them into the middle
is<00:01:19.820> because<00:01:20.360> they<00:01:20.690> slowly<00:01:21.170> work<00:01:21.770> their<00:01:21.800> way

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
is because they slowly work their way

back to the holes that are the corrupted
tentacles<00:01:26.740> come<00:01:27.740> from<00:01:28.040> and<00:01:28.460> you<00:01:28.670> may<00:01:28.790> notice

that I'm 6c soaring backwards and

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:32.980 
that I'm 6c soaring backwards and
forwards<00:01:31.280> it's<00:01:31.520> because<00:01:32.030> if<00:01:32.300> you<00:01:32.630> are<00:01:32.780> in<00:01:32.900> the

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
about 10 seconds for him to roll so if

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.240 
about 10 seconds for him to roll so if
you<00:01:44.030> move<00:01:44.630> to<00:01:44.780> one<00:01:44.870> side<00:01:45.170> try<00:01:45.890> and<00:01:45.920> count<00:01:46.190> to

when I was using a pet that the
micromanage<00:03:08.830> micromanaging<00:03:09.830> is<00:03:10.010> very

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:10.489 
micromanage micromanaging is very

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:12.820 
micromanage micromanaging is very
difficult<00:03:10.730> and<00:03:11.209> trying<00:03:12.019> to<00:03:12.170> also<00:03:12.290> keep<00:03:12.560> an<00:03:12.739> eye

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
difficult and trying to also keep an eye

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.229 
difficult and trying to also keep an eye
on<00:03:12.860> the<00:03:13.040> timers<00:03:13.459> and<00:03:13.640> everything<00:03:13.970> else<00:03:14.120> like

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
on the timers and everything else like

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.410 
on the timers and everything else like
that<00:03:14.300> so<00:03:14.810> I<00:03:15.250> decided<00:03:16.250> to<00:03:16.400> get<00:03:16.580> rid<00:03:16.640> of<00:03:16.760> it<00:03:16.940> and

that so I decided to get rid of it and

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.319 
that so I decided to get rid of it and
just<00:03:17.930> use<00:03:18.650> myself<00:03:19.010> in<00:03:19.370> hindsight<00:03:19.819> I<00:03:20.120> probably

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
just use myself in hindsight I probably

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:24.970 
just use myself in hindsight I probably
would<00:03:21.049> have<00:03:21.140> used<00:03:22.329> the<00:03:23.329> talent<00:03:23.750> of<00:03:23.980> sacrifice

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
would have used the talent of sacrifice

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.920 
would have used the talent of sacrifice
because<00:03:25.610> then<00:03:25.940> you<00:03:26.239> could<00:03:26.420> have<00:03:26.540> I<00:03:26.750> could<00:03:26.780> have

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
because then you could have I could have

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.819

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
because it isn't it i think the 11th

time i try to do this today i will show
you<00:05:05.550> the<00:05:06.240> end<00:05:06.390> some<00:05:06.720> of<00:05:06.870> my<00:05:07.460> early<00:05:08.460> attempts

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
you the end some of my early attempts

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.970 
you the end some of my early attempts
may<00:05:09.390> just<00:05:09.600> literally<00:05:10.320> taking<00:05:10.650> flying<00:05:10.860> lessons

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:10.980 
may just literally taking flying lessons

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.700 
may just literally taking flying lessons
because<00:05:11.550> i<00:05:11.880> kept<00:05:12.360> forgetting<00:05:12.480> the<00:05:12.750> role<00:05:12.960> move

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
because i kept forgetting the role move

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:16.640 
because i kept forgetting the role move
for<00:05:13.980> the<00:05:14.040> role<00:05:15.110> also<00:05:16.110> i<00:05:16.140> found<00:05:16.320> that<00:05:16.500> sometimes

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
for the role also i found that sometimes

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:20.210 
for the role also i found that sometimes
it<00:05:16.980> bugged<00:05:17.160> out<00:05:17.400> so<00:05:17.850> i<00:05:18.210> recommend<00:05:19.020> not<00:05:19.590> jumping

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 
it bugged out so i recommend not jumping

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.220 
it bugged out so i recommend not jumping
left<00:05:20.820> and<00:05:21.030> right<00:05:21.180> because<00:05:21.450> i<00:05:21.510> think<00:05:21.750> what<00:05:21.960> lost

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230 
left and right because i think what lost

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:23.720 
left and right because i think what lost
is<00:05:22.410> indeed<00:05:22.710> whilst<00:05:23.010> you're<00:05:23.160> in<00:05:23.280> the<00:05:23.400> air<00:05:23.550> it

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:23.730 
is indeed whilst you're in the air it

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:25.010 
is indeed whilst you're in the air it
doesn't<00:05:23.970> actually<00:05:24.090> register<00:05:24.630> what<00:05:24.780> side

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
doesn't actually register what side

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.900 
doesn't actually register what side
you're<00:05:25.200> on<00:05:25.260> and<00:05:25.590> it<00:05:26.040> will<00:05:26.100> just<00:05:26.280> keep<00:05:26.490> rolling

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:26.910 
you're on and it will just keep rolling

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.270 
you're on and it will just keep rolling
the<00:05:27.000> way<00:05:27.150> it<00:05:27.300> did<00:05:27.450> so<00:05:27.780> i<00:05:28.290> think<00:05:28.650> i've<00:05:29.040> done<00:05:29.250> that

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
the way it did so i think i've done that

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.280 
the way it did so i think i've done that
a<00:05:29.430> couple<00:05:29.520> of<00:05:29.790> times<00:05:29.940> in<00:05:30.330> a<00:05:30.570> few<00:05:31.050> of<00:05:31.080> my

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.290 
a couple of times in a few of my

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:34.220 
a couple of times in a few of my
attempts<00:05:31.770> to<00:05:32.520> kill<00:05:32.880> this<00:05:33.090> and<00:05:33.330> which<00:05:33.870> is<00:05:34.020> why<00:05:34.200> i

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:34.230 
attempts to kill this and which is why i

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:38.800 
attempts to kill this and which is why i
am<00:05:35.840> which<00:05:36.840> is<00:05:36.870> why<00:05:36.990> they<00:05:37.290> you<00:05:37.620> know<00:05:37.650> I<00:05:37.740> died<00:05:37.980> so

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:38.810 
am which is why they you know I died so

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:41.180 
am which is why they you know I died so
here<00:05:39.810> you'll<00:05:40.170> see<00:05:40.290> me<00:05:40.590> picking<00:05:41.040> up<00:05:41.100> the

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
here you'll see me picking up the

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:42.380 
here you'll see me picking up the
lobster<00:05:41.580> the<00:05:41.640> last<00:05:41.790> one<00:05:41.940> it<00:05:42.060> gets<00:05:42.090> so<00:05:42.300> much

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:42.390 
lobster the last one it gets so much

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.240 
lobster the last one it gets so much
faster<00:05:42.870> and<00:05:42.930> easier<00:05:43.140> when<00:05:43.530> you<00:05:43.650> get<00:05:43.830> to<00:05:43.980> the

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:44.250 
faster and easier when you get to the

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.610 
faster and easier when you get to the
end<00:05:44.370> I<00:05:44.580> actually<00:05:44.970> started<00:05:45.360> dps<00:05:46.050> in<00:05:46.200> this<00:05:46.320> one<00:05:46.500> a

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:46.620 
end I actually started dps in this one a

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:50.780 
end I actually started dps in this one a
little<00:05:46.860> bit<00:05:47.160> before<00:05:49.190> you<00:05:50.190> don't<00:05:50.400> really<00:05:50.610> need

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:50.790 
little bit before you don't really need

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.360 
little bit before you don't really need
it<00:05:50.970> but<00:05:51.000> I<00:05:51.180> did<00:05:51.420> because<00:05:51.600> I<00:05:51.830> found<00:05:52.830> it<00:05:53.010> easier

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 
it but I did because I found it easier

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:55.700 
it but I did because I found it easier

than if I if you dig this little before
you<00:05:55.860> can<00:05:56.040> just<00:05:56.250> run<00:05:56.610> across<00:05:56.730> the<00:05:57.120> other<00:05:57.210> side

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
you can just run across the other side

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:00.860 
you can just run across the other side
before<00:05:57.990> he<00:05:58.230> rolls<00:05:59.030> and<00:06:00.030> the<00:06:00.360> course<00:06:00.570> the<00:06:00.690> mob
