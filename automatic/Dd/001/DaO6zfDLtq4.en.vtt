00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
other day just doing a routine water

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.200 
other day just doing a routine water
change<00:00:18.690> and<00:00:19.369> took<00:00:20.369> one<00:00:20.520> of<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.699> plants<00:00:20.939> out

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
change and took one of the plants out

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.359 
change and took one of the plants out
change<00:00:21.630> out<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.960> water<00:00:22.170> put<00:00:22.500> it<00:00:22.619> back<00:00:22.769> in<00:00:23.070> and

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
change out the water put it back in and

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.920 
change out the water put it back in and
i<00:00:23.640> noticed<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.119> leaves<00:00:24.330> were<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.570> little<00:00:24.750> bit

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
i noticed the leaves were a little bit

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.230 
i noticed the leaves were a little bit
droopy<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.680> I<00:00:25.800> figured<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.400> no<00:00:26.609> big<00:00:26.789> deal<00:00:26.970> is

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
droopy and I figured I no big deal is

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.670 
droopy and I figured I no big deal is
just<00:00:27.449> without<00:00:27.779> water<00:00:28.050> for<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.410> little<00:00:28.470> bit

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
just without water for a little bit

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.160 
just without water for a little bit
while<00:00:28.890> I<00:00:28.920> was<00:00:29.099> changing<00:00:29.420> but<00:00:30.420> then<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.929> just

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
while I was changing but then it just

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.799 
while I was changing but then it just
never<00:00:31.619> seemed<00:00:32.070> to<00:00:32.130> recover<00:00:32.460> so<00:00:32.910> I<00:00:33.210> pulled

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
never seemed to recover so I pulled

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.990 
never seemed to recover so I pulled
actually<00:00:34.739> pulled<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.070> plant<00:00:35.340> and<00:00:35.610> cut<00:00:35.880> it

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
actually pulled the plant and cut it

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.709 
actually pulled the plant and cut it
down<00:00:36.829> and<00:00:37.829> I<00:00:38.160> think<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:38.700> might<00:00:39.000> be<00:00:39.180> doing<00:00:39.450> the

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
down and I think I might be doing the

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.630 
down and I think I might be doing the
same<00:00:39.930> with<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.620> other<00:00:40.649> two<00:00:41.100> plants<00:00:41.489> as<00:00:41.610> well

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
same with the other two plants as well

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.270 
same with the other two plants as well
because<00:00:42.300> they<00:00:42.690> aren't<00:00:43.170> looking<00:00:43.680> really<00:00:44.129> any

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
because they aren't looking really any

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.819 
because they aren't looking really any
better<00:00:44.579> they're<00:00:44.879> not<00:00:45.030> growing<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.690> in<00:00:46.680> this

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
better they're not growing and in this

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.330 
better they're not growing and in this
space<00:00:47.219> what<00:00:47.789> I'm<00:00:47.910> going<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.300> do<00:00:48.570> is<00:00:49.070> build<00:00:50.070> a

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
space what I'm going to do is build a

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.240 
space what I'm going to do is build a
new<00:00:50.520> project<00:00:51.120> for<00:00:51.360> in<00:00:51.510> there<00:00:51.800> all<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:53.070> these

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
new project for in there all of these

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.000 
new project for in there all of these
seedlings<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:54.210> cuttings<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:55.199> clones<00:00:55.620> were

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
seedlings and cuttings and clones were

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.950 
seedlings and cuttings and clones were
growing<00:00:56.430> they<00:00:56.730> need<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.000> go<00:00:57.149> someplace<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:57.690> I

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
growing they need to go someplace and I

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.660 
growing they need to go someplace and I
can't<00:00:58.230> go<00:00:58.410> on<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.649> flood<00:00:58.859> table<00:00:59.160> behind<00:00:59.340> me

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
can't go on the flood table behind me

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.639 
can't go on the flood table behind me
because<00:01:00.059> these<00:01:00.809> guys<00:01:01.050> are<00:01:01.109> on<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.410> different

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
because these guys are on a different

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.429 
because these guys are on a different
feed<00:01:02.489> program<00:01:02.969> than<00:01:03.390> what<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.960> clones<00:01:04.199> will

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
feed program than what the clones will

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.710 
feed program than what the clones will
be<00:01:04.559> on<00:01:04.710> so<00:01:05.339> I'm<00:01:05.670> going<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:05.970> take<00:01:06.150> out<00:01:06.330> all<00:01:06.570> the

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
be on so I'm going to take out all the

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.219 
be on so I'm going to take out all the
dwc<00:01:07.229> stuff<00:01:07.710> I'm<00:01:07.979> going<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.280> build<00:01:08.460> another

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
dwc stuff I'm going to build another

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.160 
dwc stuff I'm going to build another
flood<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.409> drain<00:01:10.619> table<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.159> lot<00:01:11.430> smaller<00:01:11.760> and

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
flood and drain table a lot smaller and

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.450 
flood and drain table a lot smaller and
this<00:01:13.170> way<00:01:13.350> we<00:01:13.380> can<00:01:13.560> grow<00:01:13.830> some<00:01:14.070> things<00:01:14.280> in

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
this way we can grow some things in

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.219 
this way we can grow some things in
there<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.970> I<00:01:15.420> don't<00:01:15.630> have<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.840> worry<00:01:16.080> about

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
they can grow when I first bought my

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.690 
they can grow when I first bought my
house<00:01:34.079> there's<00:01:34.409> actually<00:01:34.799> a<00:01:34.829> lot<00:01:34.890> of<00:01:35.310> items

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
house there's actually a lot of items

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.120 
house there's actually a lot of items
that<00:01:36.000> the<00:01:36.150> previous<00:01:36.540> owners<00:01:36.869> left<00:01:37.110> behind<00:01:37.560> and

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
that the previous owners left behind and

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.920 
that the previous owners left behind and
one<00:01:38.340> of<00:01:38.490> those<00:01:38.610> things<00:01:38.909> that<00:01:39.090> they<00:01:39.270> left<00:01:39.540> was

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
one of those things that they left was

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.230 
one of those things that they left was
this<00:01:40.229> really<00:01:40.500> old<00:01:40.799> it's<00:01:41.430> almost<00:01:41.579> was<00:01:41.939> probably

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
this really old it's almost was probably

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.780 
this really old it's almost was probably
an<00:01:42.360> antique<00:01:42.750> sink<00:01:43.520> and<00:01:45.170> this<00:01:46.170> thing<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:46.829> think<00:01:47.460> I

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
an antique sink and this thing I think I

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.569 
an antique sink and this thing I think I
can<00:01:48.540> use<00:01:49.020> as<00:01:49.380> my<00:01:51.500> flood<00:01:52.500> table<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:53.009> guess<00:01:53.070> for

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
can use as my flood table I guess for

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.280 
can use as my flood table I guess for
this<00:01:53.759> new<00:01:53.970> flood<00:01:54.390> and<00:01:54.540> drain<00:01:54.720> system<00:01:55.170> i'm

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
this new flood and drain system i'm

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.429 
this new flood and drain system i'm
going<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.680> build<00:01:56.750> so<00:01:57.750> it's<00:01:57.899> not<00:01:57.990> going<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.320> be

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
going to build so it's not going to be

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.170 
going to build so it's not going to be
much<00:01:58.649> different<00:01:59.189> than<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.549> flood<00:01:59.759> table<00:02:00.090> i

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
much different than the flood table i

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.899 
much different than the flood table i
built<00:02:00.390> before<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:01.110> i<00:02:01.920> make<00:02:02.100> videos<00:02:02.130> of<00:02:02.490> that

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
built before and i make videos of that

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.120 
built before and i make videos of that
build<00:02:03.149> as<00:02:03.329> well<00:02:03.540> this<00:02:04.469> one<00:02:04.680> I'm<00:02:04.799> just<00:02:04.950> going<00:02:05.100> to

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
build as well this one I'm just going to

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.910 
build as well this one I'm just going to
take<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.340> few<00:02:05.430> measurements<00:02:05.700> here<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.860> try<00:02:07.860> to

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
take a few measurements here and try to

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.480 
take a few measurements here and try to
build<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.610> shelves<00:02:09.060> around<00:02:09.450> it

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
build the shelves around it

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.640 
build the shelves around it
and<00:02:10.580> that<00:02:11.120> should<00:02:11.510> be<00:02:11.540> it<00:02:11.750> i'm<00:02:12.170> not<00:02:12.320> expecting

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
and that should be it i'm not expecting

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.580 
and that should be it i'm not expecting
any<00:02:12.980> big<00:02:13.070> surprises<00:02:13.370> with<00:02:13.970> this<00:02:14.120> one<00:02:14.330> so<00:02:15.200> let's

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
any big surprises with this one so let's

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.860 
any big surprises with this one so let's
get<00:02:15.770> into<00:02:15.920> the<00:02:16.100> garage<00:02:16.250> and<00:02:16.480> start<00:02:17.480> building

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
get into the garage and start building

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.760 
get into the garage and start building
so<00:02:18.740> in<00:02:19.070> my<00:02:19.220> grad<00:02:19.460> have<00:02:20.300> my<00:02:20.450> lumber<00:02:20.870> I<00:02:21.170> know

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
so in my grad have my lumber I know

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.160 
so in my grad have my lumber I know
about<00:02:22.460> what<00:02:22.730> I<00:02:22.760> want<00:02:22.970> to<00:02:23.060> do<00:02:23.180> for<00:02:23.210> size<00:02:23.720> and

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
about what I want to do for size and

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.190 
about what I want to do for size and
design<00:02:24.290> for<00:02:24.740> this<00:02:24.860> one<00:02:25.100> so<00:02:25.130> just<00:02:25.550> a<00:02:25.820> matter<00:02:26.000> of

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
design for this one so just a matter of

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.100 
design for this one so just a matter of
cutting<00:02:27.200> these<00:02:27.470> things<00:02:27.770> down<00:02:28.100> and<00:02:29.110> putting

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
cutting these things down and putting

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:55.220 
cutting these things down and putting
them<00:02:30.290> together

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.260 

the<00:02:56.230> sink<00:02:56.530> is<00:02:56.650> going<00:02:56.920> to<00:02:57.100> set<00:02:57.400> in<00:02:57.610> this<00:02:58.060> piece

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
the sink is going to set in this piece

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.540 
the sink is going to set in this piece
of<00:02:58.360> plywood<00:02:58.570> I've<00:02:59.020> traced<00:02:59.830> the<00:03:00.040> outside<00:03:00.430> of

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
of plywood I've traced the outside of

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.120 
of plywood I've traced the outside of
the<00:03:00.640> sink<00:03:00.940> and<00:03:01.180> then<00:03:01.690> I<00:03:01.720> took<00:03:01.840> it<00:03:02.110> in<00:03:02.290> just<00:03:03.010> over

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
the sink and then I took it in just over

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.520 
the sink and then I took it in just over
an<00:03:03.370> inch<00:03:03.520> to<00:03:03.880> make<00:03:04.000> up<00:03:04.180> for<00:03:04.570> the<00:03:04.960> lip<00:03:05.170> that's<00:03:05.320> on

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
an inch to make up for the lip that's on

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.920 
an inch to make up for the lip that's on
the<00:03:05.650> sink<00:03:05.890> so<00:03:06.160> I'll<00:03:06.250> take<00:03:06.400> a<00:03:06.430> jigsaw<00:03:06.940> and<00:03:07.210> cut

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
the sink so I'll take a jigsaw and cut

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.500 
the sink so I'll take a jigsaw and cut
this<00:03:08.110> out<00:03:08.320> and<00:03:08.530> then<00:03:08.620> I<00:03:09.400> will<00:03:09.820> be<00:03:09.850> one<00:03:10.300> step

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
this out and then I will be one step

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:52.090 
this out and then I will be one step
closer<00:03:10.930> to<00:03:11.410> completing<00:03:12.010> this<00:03:12.280> thing

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.010 

there<00:03:53.100> we<00:03:53.250> go<00:03:53.400> that's<00:03:54.270> probably<00:03:54.570> all<00:03:54.660> I<00:03:54.750> want

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
there we go that's probably all I want

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.900 
there we go that's probably all I want
to<00:03:55.080> be<00:03:55.140> doing<00:03:55.290> for<00:03:55.530> outside<00:03:55.920> right<00:03:56.130> now<00:03:56.160> it's

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
to be doing for outside right now it's

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.420 
to be doing for outside right now it's
pretty<00:03:57.090> cold<00:03:57.510> so<00:03:57.960> I<00:03:57.990> think<00:03:58.470> I<00:03:58.650> can<00:03:58.860> manage<00:03:58.980> the

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
pretty cold so I think I can manage the

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.670 
pretty cold so I think I can manage the
rest<00:03:59.610> inside<00:04:00.060> and<00:04:00.420> we'll<00:04:00.990> get<00:04:01.080> everything

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
rest inside and we'll get everything

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:29.300 
rest inside and we'll get everything
else<00:04:01.980> put<00:04:02.520> together

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.280 

alright<00:04:30.090> that<00:04:30.480> looks<00:04:30.510> like<00:04:30.900> it<00:04:31.260> might

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
alright that looks like it might

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.960 
alright that looks like it might
actually<00:04:31.860> work<00:04:32.990> so<00:04:33.990> I'm<00:04:34.290> going<00:04:34.380> to<00:04:34.710> put<00:04:35.460> it<00:04:35.910> in

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
actually work so I'm going to put it in
