00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:31.489
 extra strong bmw m5 kicks the audi 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:34.599
 rs 6 plus was created at two mega bangers 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:34.599
 from brave sedan 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:53.030
 exactly 9 187 ps that gives goose bumps on 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:54.470
 whole body 52 engine maps if 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.930
 you have to turn key has turned that 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:01.070
 car 400 ps when you press the power button 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:06.309
 pushes then he has full 507 hp the car 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:06.309
 is really difficult for 240 euros 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:14.890
 bmw specifies acceleration values 47 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:21.020
 seconds from 0 to 100 and 14 4 to 200 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:24.970
 which quite the rs 6 plus has as well 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.970
 pretty impressive values ​​to offer 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.630
 and he can not really follow it 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:46.740
 The room moves away slowly 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.740
 we probably can not keep up with what 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.540
 but soon comes the hour of 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.650
 The winner of ours is 280 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.860
 250 like interest because the guys from whom we are 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.810
 keep the gentleman's agreement 1 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:04.260
 this one says that was at 250 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.780
 but should be limited but only express s 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:10.490
 track to 80 cents and so good 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.490
 sees the audi a5 over 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.130
 he has not turned bad in five 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:28.990
 drama but tailored suit the front apron 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:32.320
 razor sharp the kingsize brake with 374 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:35.080
 mm she holds the 507 horses perfectly 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.940
 fence a hot part 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.510
 But we could find the bodywork 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:43.270
 be closer to the asphalt 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.500
 Inside there's a cool 86,000 business look 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.840
 Euro should be on the high edge 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.209
 if you want to take a seat here 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:55.420
 who has the coal will with optimal 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:58.600
 seat ergonomics rewards the woman is 10 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:02.860
 an absolute cream cut see you 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:06.030
 please bend this armada to the formula 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:06.030
 1 sends greetings 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.319
 from Formula 1 comes the launch 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:22.880
 control a fully automatic run off the 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.880
 racing city as from the textbook 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:39.860
 at rs 6 are only the mirrors 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:44.540
 silvery everything else shimmers evil 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:45.319
 black audi typically very tidy of 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.900
 inner space 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:51.220
 Here you feel right at home 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.220
 Processing is great 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:11.330
 the classic rear wheel drive is the m5 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.330
 far more agile than the rs 6 

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:18.169
 the four-wheel in the audi makes for high 

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:21.250
 driving safety and best traction the 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:24.199
 He can not offer light-footed sm5 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.970
 on the highway he was almost at the age of 5 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:28.550
 even more fun than on the highway because 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.689
 here the handyness even more 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:33.539
 weight drops 

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:35.659
 You can program between three damper 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:38.009
 choose and at the sportiest level 

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:41.029
 you notice here the transverse joints of the author 

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:41.029
 crazy to drive away 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:48.940
 and this sound madness 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:52.200
 to implement is unbelievable and third 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.200
 It is easy to apply 

00:05:01.359 --> 00:05:07.270
 certainly the best in its segment 

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:09.310
 and diversified offer 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.890
 In addition, he can also 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.280
 with some so-called supercars 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.410
 measure up 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.040
 The audi thrilled mainly by 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:22.060
 his v8 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:22.060
 the v8 480 ps to dare the rest properly 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:31.750
 leave once 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:45.699
 in curves, the rs6 knows no twitch 

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:47.620
 unfortunately not really the tail 

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:52.440
 suitable there he has beside us in the 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:52.440
 the nose floods ahead 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:05.220
 the m5 depends on the rs6 so easy 

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:05.220
 Both are exciting in their own way
