00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.070 

I

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:06.080 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.110 

now<00:00:07.080> we're<00:00:07.260> going<00:00:07.410> to<00:00:07.470> do<00:00:07.760> the<00:00:08.760> small

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
now we're going to do the small

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.080 
now we're going to do the small
intestine<00:00:09.750> balance<00:00:10.260> and<00:00:10.440> so<00:00:11.100> for<00:00:11.309> this<00:00:11.460> I'm

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
intestine balance and so for this I'm

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.720 
intestine balance and so for this I'm
going<00:00:12.330> to<00:00:12.420> take<00:00:12.780> a<00:00:12.840> half<00:00:13.200> step<00:00:13.440> backwards<00:00:14.160> with

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
going to take a half step backwards with

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.359 
going to take a half step backwards with
my<00:00:14.880> right<00:00:15.120> foot<00:00:15.380> and<00:00:16.380> this<00:00:16.770> will<00:00:16.950> be<00:00:17.040> doing<00:00:17.279> it

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
my right foot and this will be doing it

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.359 
my right foot and this will be doing it
on<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.580> left<00:00:17.760> side<00:00:18.230> so<00:00:19.230> I<00:00:19.470> think<00:00:19.680> if<00:00:19.950> half<00:00:20.130> step

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
on the left side so I think if half step

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.720 
on the left side so I think if half step
back<00:00:20.610> with<00:00:20.640> my<00:00:20.880> right<00:00:21.150> foot<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:21.720> I<00:00:22.710> make<00:00:23.699> a

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
back with my right foot and I make a

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.310 
back with my right foot and I make a
mudra<00:00:24.210> that<00:00:24.449> looks<00:00:24.630> like<00:00:24.750> this<00:00:24.869> i<00:00:24.930> think<00:00:25.140> these

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
mudra that looks like this i think these

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.560

it<00:02:44.220> feels<00:02:44.400> like<00:02:44.520> I'm<00:02:44.670> sitting<00:02:44.880> in<00:02:45.090> an

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
it feels like I'm sitting in an

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.000 
it feels like I'm sitting in an
imaginary<00:02:45.330> chair<00:02:45.990> and<00:02:47.420> so<00:02:48.470> now<00:02:49.470> what<00:02:49.740> you<00:02:49.860> want

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
imaginary chair and so now what you want

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.670 
imaginary chair and so now what you want
to<00:02:50.040> do<00:02:50.190> here<00:02:50.459> is<00:02:50.670> maybe<00:02:51.660> take<00:02:51.900> this<00:02:52.110> foot<00:02:52.380> and

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
to do here is maybe take this foot and

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.100 
to do here is maybe take this foot and
move<00:02:52.920> it<00:02:53.070> out<00:02:53.190> to<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.090> side<00:02:54.120> just<00:02:54.330> a<00:02:54.690> bit<00:02:54.900> there

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
move it out to the side just a bit there

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.870 
move it out to the side just a bit there
you<00:02:55.200> go<00:02:55.380> okay<00:02:56.250> and<00:02:57.950> you<00:02:58.950> bend<00:02:59.190> this<00:02:59.340> back<00:02:59.610> leg

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
you go okay and you bend this back leg

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.600 
you go okay and you bend this back leg
which<00:03:00.209> is<00:03:00.390> just<00:03:00.810> a<00:03:00.930> bit<00:03:01.170> and<00:03:01.320> lock<00:03:02.160> the<00:03:02.400> front

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
which is just a bit and lock the front

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.990 
which is just a bit and lock the front
one<00:03:02.850> probably<00:03:03.780> you<00:03:04.020> get<00:03:04.200> DMV<00:03:04.620> lon<00:03:04.830> the<00:03:05.459> pelvis

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
one probably you get DMV lon the pelvis

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.360 
one probably you get DMV lon the pelvis
will<00:03:06.600> rotate<00:03:07.290> forward<00:03:08.330> like<00:03:09.330> this<00:03:09.980> and<00:03:10.980> so

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
will rotate forward like this and so

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.420 
will rotate forward like this and so
there<00:03:11.730> we<00:03:11.850> go<00:03:11.910> and<00:03:12.330> so<00:03:12.870> now<00:03:13.080> the<00:03:13.430> finger

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
there we go and so now the finger

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.120 
there we go and so now the finger
position<00:03:14.989> will<00:03:15.989> be<00:03:16.019> right<00:03:16.380> here<00:03:16.410> over<00:03:16.920> top<00:03:17.100> of

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
position will be right here over top of

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.500 
position will be right here over top of
the<00:03:17.370> small<00:03:17.640> intestine<00:03:17.870> now<00:03:19.820> focus<00:03:20.820> will<00:03:21.480> be

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
the small intestine now focus will be

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.970 
the small intestine now focus will be
down<00:03:22.260> at<00:03:22.440> the<00:03:22.560> floor<00:03:23.480> okay<00:03:24.590> you<00:03:25.590> can<00:03:25.739> do<00:03:25.890> it

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
down at the floor okay you can do it

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.560 
down at the floor okay you can do it
straight<00:03:26.220> ahead<00:03:26.370> but<00:03:26.700> i<00:03:26.790> prefer<00:03:27.120> down<00:03:27.330> at<00:03:27.480> the

breath<00:04:21.739> and<00:04:25.540> you<00:04:26.540> can<00:04:26.720> release<00:04:26.990> out<00:04:27.280> through

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
breath and you can release out through

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.129 
breath and you can release out through
the<00:04:28.430> mouth<00:04:28.460> if<00:04:28.850> you<00:04:28.880> like<00:04:29.180> whenever<00:04:30.020> you're

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
discharging the final breath then it

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.510 
discharging the final breath then it
helps<00:04:32.930> to<00:04:33.110> get<00:04:33.229> a<00:04:33.290> little<00:04:33.530> bit<00:04:33.650> more<00:04:33.830> Chi<00:04:34.160> out

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
helps to get a little bit more Chi out

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.280 
helps to get a little bit more Chi out
of<00:04:34.790> the<00:04:34.880> body<00:04:35.290> just<00:04:36.290> like<00:04:36.350> talking<00:04:37.990> direct<00:04:38.990> Chi

intestine and I'm bringing up and around

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:25.119 
intestine and I'm bringing up and around
and<00:07:22.759> I<00:07:23.210> can<00:07:23.360> just<00:07:23.389> see<00:07:23.810> that<00:07:24.050> energy<00:07:24.830> and<00:07:24.860> I<00:07:24.979> can

00:07:30.399 --> 00:07:30.409 
intestine radiant around and out and so

00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:32.559 
intestine radiant around and out and so
it<00:07:30.500> helps<00:07:30.800> to<00:07:30.889> know<00:07:30.919> your<00:07:31.250> meridians<00:07:31.400> but<00:07:32.389> even

00:07:32.559 --> 00:07:32.569 
it helps to know your meridians but even

00:07:32.569 --> 00:07:35.680 
it helps to know your meridians but even
if<00:07:32.960> you<00:07:33.319> don't<00:07:33.680> it<00:07:34.099> will<00:07:34.250> work<00:07:34.699> anyway<00:07:35.419> and

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:35.690 
if you don't it will work anyway and

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:38.860 
if you don't it will work anyway and
I'll<00:07:36.259> explain<00:07:36.649> that<00:07:36.709> in<00:07:37.099> some<00:07:37.849> later<00:07:38.060> volumes

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:38.870 
I'll explain that in some later volumes

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:39.420 
I'll explain that in some later volumes
but

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:39.430 
but

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:42.090 
but
the<00:07:39.670> main<00:07:40.030> thing<00:07:40.060> is<00:07:40.240> just<00:07:40.600> do<00:07:40.960> it<00:07:41.140> you<00:07:41.830> know<00:07:41.950> we

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:42.100 
the main thing is just do it you know we

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:44.700 
the main thing is just do it you know we
have<00:07:42.250> a<00:07:42.280> real<00:07:42.910> kind<00:07:43.090> of<00:07:43.300> saying<00:07:43.570> and<00:07:43.900> shushing

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:44.710 
have a real kind of saying and shushing

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:48.000 
have a real kind of saying and shushing
tile<00:07:45.070> temple<00:07:45.460> is<00:07:45.630> just<00:07:46.630> know<00:07:46.810> it<00:07:47.020> just<00:07:47.590> feel<00:07:47.830> it

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:48.010 
tile temple is just know it just feel it

00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:50.250 
tile temple is just know it just feel it
and<00:07:48.190> just<00:07:48.610> do<00:07:48.820> it<00:07:48.970> and<00:07:49.150> you<00:07:49.810> can't<00:07:50.080> go<00:07:50.230> wrong

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:50.260 
and just do it and you can't go wrong

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.050 
and just do it and you can't go wrong
you<00:07:50.920> know<00:07:51.040> you'll<00:07:51.250> at<00:07:51.400> least<00:07:51.430> get<00:07:51.880> it

00:07:52.050 --> 00:07:52.060 
you know you'll at least get it

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:54.600 
you know you'll at least get it
seventy-five<00:07:52.960> eighty<00:07:53.200> percent<00:07:53.410> and<00:07:53.830> that's<00:07:54.460> a

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:54.610 
seventy-five eighty percent and that's a

00:07:54.610 --> 00:07:57.840 
seventy-five eighty percent and that's a
pretty<00:07:54.880> good<00:07:55.150> yield<00:07:55.510> so<00:07:56.340> with<00:07:57.340> the<00:07:57.430> techniques

00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:57.850 
pretty good yield so with the techniques

00:07:57.850 --> 00:07:59.910 
pretty good yield so with the techniques
that<00:07:57.940> we<00:07:58.120> use<00:07:58.150> and<00:07:58.510> then<00:07:59.170> you<00:07:59.320> can<00:07:59.470> work<00:07:59.650> on<00:07:59.770> the

00:07:59.910 --> 00:07:59.920 
that we use and then you can work on the

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:01.980 
that we use and then you can work on the
refinements<00:08:00.490> later<00:08:00.670> so<00:08:01.240> just<00:08:01.480> don't<00:08:01.660> get<00:08:01.780> hung

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:01.990 
refinements later so just don't get hung

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:04.380 
refinements later so just don't get hung
up<00:08:02.140> on<00:08:02.320> technical<00:08:02.860> aspects<00:08:03.340> it's<00:08:03.820> all<00:08:04.030> very

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:04.390 
up on technical aspects it's all very

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:06.900 
up on technical aspects it's all very
simple<00:08:04.510> there's<00:08:05.410> nothing<00:08:05.620> mystical<00:08:06.220> about<00:08:06.520> it

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:06.910 
simple there's nothing mystical about it

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:10.260 
simple there's nothing mystical about it
or<00:08:07.060> anything<00:08:07.120> like<00:08:07.420> that<00:08:07.570> so<00:08:08.850> I'll<00:08:09.850> do<00:08:10.150> the

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:10.270 
or anything like that so I'll do the

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:12.510 
or anything like that so I'll do the
technique<00:08:10.540> down<00:08:10.900> and<00:08:11.260> show<00:08:12.100> you<00:08:12.160> how<00:08:12.370> it

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:12.520 
technique down and show you how it

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:14.760 
technique down and show you how it
should<00:08:12.730> look
