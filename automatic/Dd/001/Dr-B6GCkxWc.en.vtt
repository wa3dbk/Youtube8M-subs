00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
and in-depth let's say you have your

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.990 
and in-depth let's say you have your
vehicle<00:02:13.530> right

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
vehicle right

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.700 
vehicle right
we've<00:02:14.210> got<00:02:14.420> tanks<00:02:14.780> we've<00:02:14.960> got<00:02:15.140> jeeps<00:02:15.440> we've

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
we've got tanks we've got jeeps we've

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.160 
we've got tanks we've got jeeps we've
got<00:02:15.920> jets<00:02:16.250> we've<00:02:16.520> got<00:02:16.700> helicopters<00:02:17.170> they're

got jets we've got helicopters they're

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.700 
got jets we've got helicopters they're
basically<00:02:18.650> a<00:02:18.770> shell<00:02:19.370> that<00:02:20.150> you<00:02:20.210> exist<00:02:20.840> in<00:02:21.080> with

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
basically a shell that you exist in with

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.910 
basically a shell that you exist in with
a<00:02:21.740> hitbox<00:02:22.220> and<00:02:23.080> when<00:02:24.080> you<00:02:24.200> get<00:02:24.380> hit<00:02:24.590> you<00:02:24.770> go

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
a hitbox and when you get hit you go

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.860 
a hitbox and when you get hit you go
that<00:02:25.130> that's<00:02:25.910> pretty<00:02:26.180> much<00:02:26.330> the<00:02:26.480> way<00:02:26.570> it<00:02:26.600> works

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
that that's pretty much the way it works

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.540 
that that's pretty much the way it works
right<00:02:27.050> now<00:02:27.110> imagine<00:02:28.040> if<00:02:28.130> you<00:02:28.250> were<00:02:28.340> driving

you<00:03:56.120> know<00:03:56.209> it's<00:03:56.450> a<00:03:56.570> lot<00:03:56.780> more<00:03:57.110> than<00:03:57.440> simply

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:57.829 
you know it's a lot more than simply

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:00.460 
you know it's a lot more than simply
talking<00:03:58.370> about<00:03:58.610> how<00:03:58.850> shit<00:03:59.269> looks<00:03:59.720> did<00:04:00.110> stuff

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
talking about how shit looks did stuff

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.979

absolutely it looked awesome
alternatively<00:04:08.870> it<00:04:09.079> look<00:04:09.290> kind<00:04:09.560> of<00:04:09.650> like

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
alternatively it look kind of like

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:11.560 
alternatively it look kind of like

interesting things that I saw personally
with<00:04:44.740> my<00:04:44.770> eyes<00:04:45.190> from<00:04:45.729> the<00:04:45.970> Sony<00:04:46.210> meeting<00:04:46.629> last

with my eyes from the Sony meeting last

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:49.830 
with my eyes from the Sony meeting last
night<00:04:47.050> was<00:04:47.919> the<00:04:47.949> simple<00:04:48.490> physics<00:04:48.879> tests<00:04:49.300> like

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
night was the simple physics tests like

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.899 
night was the simple physics tests like
when<00:04:50.110> they<00:04:50.259> dropped<00:04:50.620> a<00:04:50.770> million<00:04:51.280> items<00:04:51.460> in

00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:51.909 
when they dropped a million items in

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:54.619 
when they dropped a million items in
like<00:04:52.419> this<00:04:52.690> kind<00:04:52.960> of<00:04:53.050> pre-made<00:04:53.620> environment

00:04:54.619 --> 00:04:54.629 
like this kind of pre-made environment

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:58.260 
like this kind of pre-made environment
with<00:04:55.629> different<00:04:56.379> heights<00:04:56.530> different<00:04:57.270> slants

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
with different heights different slants

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.779 
with different heights different slants
and<00:04:58.740> they<00:04:59.740> just<00:04:59.949> dropped<00:05:00.250> a<00:05:00.370> million<00:05:00.699> items

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:00.789 
and they just dropped a million items

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:03.510 
and they just dropped a million items
out<00:05:01.180> of<00:05:01.300> the<00:05:01.419> sky<00:05:01.780> and<00:05:02.110> into<00:05:02.440> this<00:05:02.830> place<00:05:03.190> and

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
out of the sky and into this place and

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.399 
out of the sky and into this place and
all<00:05:03.880> the<00:05:03.909> physics<00:05:04.419> were<00:05:04.599> there<00:05:04.780> the<00:05:05.050> balance

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:05.409 
all the physics were there the balance

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:07.409 
all the physics were there the balance
the<00:05:05.650> effect<00:05:05.949> of<00:05:06.099> gravity<00:05:06.610> the<00:05:06.789> effect<00:05:07.090> of<00:05:07.300> the

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 
the effect of gravity the effect of the

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:08.909 
the effect of gravity the effect of the
slant<00:05:07.720> they<00:05:07.930> would<00:05:08.080> land<00:05:08.289> at<00:05:08.530> the<00:05:08.680> type<00:05:08.889> of

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 
slant they would land at the type of

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
material they landed on it seemed to

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.800 
material they landed on it seemed to
generate<00:05:11.590> a<00:05:11.740> different<00:05:12.669> response<00:05:13.150> out<00:05:13.449> of<00:05:13.720> the

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
generate a different response out of the

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.330 
generate a different response out of the
object<00:05:14.289> and<00:05:14.470> those<00:05:14.620> that<00:05:14.800> fell<00:05:15.009> on<00:05:15.159> hard

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
object and those that fell on hard

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.610 
object and those that fell on hard
surfaces<00:05:15.819> all<00:05:16.300> that<00:05:16.960> kind<00:05:17.199> of<00:05:17.259> shit<00:05:17.440> was

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:17.620 
surfaces all that kind of shit was

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.999 
surfaces all that kind of shit was
fantastic<00:05:18.219> the<00:05:18.729> model<00:05:19.210> of<00:05:19.539> the<00:05:20.469> old<00:05:20.500> dudes

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:21.009 
fantastic the model of the old dudes

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:24.330 
fantastic the model of the old dudes
face<00:05:21.300> looked<00:05:22.300> amazing<00:05:22.930> because<00:05:23.110> you<00:05:23.590> know<00:05:23.650> the

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.340 
face looked amazing because you know the

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:29.309 
face looked amazing because you know the
more<00:05:24.550> you<00:05:24.610> can<00:05:26.610> you<00:05:27.610> know<00:05:27.729> show<00:05:28.319> expression

00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:29.319 
more you can you know show expression

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:31.680 
more you can you know show expression
within<00:05:29.590> a<00:05:29.620> game<00:05:29.889> it's<00:05:30.610> you<00:05:31.000> know<00:05:31.120> technically

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.690 
within a game it's you know technically

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.149 
within a game it's you know technically
the<00:05:31.840> more<00:05:32.020> emotive<00:05:32.560> that's<00:05:32.800> something

00:05:33.149 --> 00:05:33.159 
the more emotive that's something

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:35.490 
the more emotive that's something
becomes<00:05:33.550> because<00:05:34.030> human<00:05:34.389> beings<00:05:34.419> we<00:05:34.960> respond

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500

to<00:05:35.830> expression<00:05:36.250> on<00:05:36.580> faces<00:05:37.150> it's<00:05:37.360> not<00:05:37.539> just

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780 
to expression on faces it's not just

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.110

the habit that people have of dragging
up<00:06:40.400> old<00:06:40.610> IPs<00:06:41.060> I<00:06:41.240> neither<00:06:41.389> re<00:06:41.719> skinning<00:06:42.080> them<00:06:42.199> or
