00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
dextrose sugar what I mean by that is

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.000 
dextrose sugar what I mean by that is
like<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.580> fruit<00:00:41.850> sugar<00:00:42.260> grape<00:00:43.260> juice<00:00:43.620> apple

or<00:00:47.580> apple<00:00:47.790> juice<00:00:48.059> is<00:00:48.540> going<00:00:49.019> to<00:00:49.170> make<00:00:49.379> that

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
or apple juice is going to make that

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.400 
or apple juice is going to make that

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
those two that dexterous sugar it was

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.959 
those two that dexterous sugar it was
funny<00:00:58.020> because<00:00:58.230> no<00:00:59.129> one<00:00:59.250> really<00:00:59.280> ever<00:00:59.520> told

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
funny because no one really ever told

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.209 
funny because no one really ever told
told<00:01:00.570> me<00:01:00.750> that<00:01:00.960> or<00:01:01.170> anything<00:01:01.350> like<00:01:01.559> that<00:01:01.620> but
