a<00:00:19.020> 30%<00:00:19.410> overdrive<00:00:20.220> pulley<00:00:20.520> we<00:00:21.060> also<00:00:21.270> offer<00:00:21.630> a

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
a 30% overdrive pulley we also offer a

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.130 
a 30% overdrive pulley we also offer a
50<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.590> 80%<00:00:23.100> overdrive<00:00:24.090> what<00:00:24.779> that's<00:00:24.960> going

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
50 and 80% overdrive what that's going

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.839 
50 and 80% overdrive what that's going
to<00:00:25.230> do<00:00:25.350> is<00:00:25.500> spool<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.920> supercharger<00:00:26.550> up<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.820> a

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
to do is spool the supercharger up to a

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.269 
to do is spool the supercharger up to a
faster<00:00:27.390> rpm<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.410> give<00:00:28.560> you<00:00:28.680> more<00:00:28.949> pressure

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
faster rpm and give you more pressure

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.650 
faster rpm and give you more pressure
going<00:00:29.699> into<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.060> engine

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
going into the engine

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.970 
going into the engine
that's<00:00:30.840> going<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:31.019> give<00:00:31.140> you<00:00:31.230> more<00:00:31.470> horsepower

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
that's going to give you more horsepower

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.580 
that's going to give you more horsepower
than<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.399> stock<00:00:32.669> 30%<00:00:33.480> overdrive<00:00:33.870> pulley

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
nut back in place now you want to make

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.380 
nut back in place now you want to make
sure<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.039> pulley<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.910> internal

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
sure that the pulley and the internal

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.359 
sure that the pulley and the internal
impeller<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:03.930> locked<00:01:04.229> tight<00:01:04.470> together<00:01:04.890> give

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
impeller is locked tight together give

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.070 
impeller is locked tight together give
it<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.549> spin<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.060> everything<00:01:06.510> should<00:01:06.750> spin

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
it a spin and everything should spin

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.469 
it a spin and everything should spin
freely<00:01:07.670> so<00:01:08.670> if<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:08.850> need<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.119> know<00:01:09.270> how<00:01:09.450> to

check<00:01:11.640> out<00:01:11.790> this<00:01:11.939> video<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.510> I'll<00:01:12.570> tell<00:01:12.750> you

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
check out this video and I'll tell you

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.609 
check out this video and I'll tell you
exactly<00:01:13.260> how<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.530> do<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:15.409> now<00:01:16.409> if<00:01:16.530> you

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
exactly how to do it now if you

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.410 
exactly how to do it now if you
installed<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.189> high<00:01:17.400> flow<00:01:17.729> exhaust<00:01:18.030> you'll

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
installed a high flow exhaust you'll

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.969 
installed a high flow exhaust you'll
probably<00:01:18.600> notice<00:01:18.900> there<00:01:19.200> isn't<00:01:19.560> enough<00:01:19.740> back

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
probably notice there isn't enough back

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.499 
probably notice there isn't enough back
pressure<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.490> pump<00:01:20.729> enough<00:01:20.850> fuel<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.270> the

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
line from the fuel tank then you want to

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.130 
line from the fuel tank then you want to
connect<00:02:04.400> it<00:02:04.550> to<00:02:04.760> the<00:02:04.910> line<00:02:05.150> coming<00:02:05.570> from<00:02:05.930> the

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
connect it to the line coming from the

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.770 
connect it to the line coming from the
exhaust<00:02:06.260> pipe<00:02:07.090> then<00:02:08.090> you<00:02:08.209> want<00:02:08.390> to<00:02:08.479> connect

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
exhaust pipe then you want to connect

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.870 
exhaust pipe then you want to connect
the<00:02:09.020> spare<00:02:09.470> line<00:02:09.739> that's<00:02:10.070> given<00:02:10.399> in<00:02:10.520> the<00:02:10.550> kit

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
the spare line that's given in the kit

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.320 
the spare line that's given in the kit
from<00:02:11.630> both<00:02:11.840> the<00:02:12.020> Y<00:02:12.280> over<00:02:13.280> to<00:02:13.459> the<00:02:13.640> supercharger

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
from both the Y over to the supercharger

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.710 
from both the Y over to the supercharger
pressure<00:02:14.600> outlet<00:02:14.900> as<00:02:16.030> you<00:02:17.030> can<00:02:17.180> see<00:02:17.330> all<00:02:17.570> the

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
pressure outlet as you can see all the

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.479 
pressure outlet as you can see all the
lines<00:02:17.930> are<00:02:18.170> connected<00:02:18.350> up<00:02:18.770> and<00:02:18.950> that's<00:02:19.340> going

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
lines are connected up and that's going

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:20.920 
lines are connected up and that's going
to<00:02:19.550> give<00:02:19.700> you<00:02:19.790> a<00:02:19.850> more<00:02:20.060> pressure<00:02:20.450> going<00:02:20.720> into

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
to give you a more pressure going into

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.960 
to give you a more pressure going into
your<00:02:21.230> fuel<00:02:21.470> cell<00:02:21.770> using<00:02:22.220> both<00:02:22.430> the<00:02:22.670> exhaust

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
your fuel cell using both the exhaust

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.180 
your fuel cell using both the exhaust
and<00:02:23.300> the<00:02:23.840> supercharger<00:02:24.530> pressure<00:02:27.160> if<00:02:28.160> you

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
and the supercharger pressure if you

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.500
