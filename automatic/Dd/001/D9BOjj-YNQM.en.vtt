that<00:00:41.569> i<00:00:41.600> would<00:00:41.749> be<00:00:41.929> better<00:00:44.859> let's<00:00:45.859> try<00:00:45.979> that

00:00:46.209 --> 00:00:46.219 
that i would be better let's try that

00:00:46.219 --> 00:01:05.910 
that i would be better let's try that
way<00:00:49.839> and<00:00:50.839> what's<00:00:51.079> up<00:00:51.289> this<00:00:51.499> way<00:01:03.519> safely<00:01:04.519> Oh
