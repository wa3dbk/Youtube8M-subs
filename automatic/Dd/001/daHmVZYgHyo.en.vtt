largest<00:00:28.410> RV<00:00:28.830> show<00:00:29.099> one<00:00:29.880> of<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.060> things<00:00:30.300> that

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:30.540 
largest RV show one of the things that

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.290 
largest RV show one of the things that
people<00:00:31.259> run<00:00:31.590> into<00:00:31.770> is<00:00:32.220> their<00:00:32.790> electrical

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
people run into is their electrical

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.750 
people run into is their electrical
service<00:00:33.720> cord<00:00:34.050> coming<00:00:34.350> out<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.650> their<00:00:34.739> RV<00:00:35.129> and

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
service cord coming out of their RV and

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.880 
service cord coming out of their RV and
sometimes<00:00:36.660> especially<00:00:36.989> as<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.440> RV<00:00:37.680> gets<00:00:37.830> a

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
sometimes especially as the RV gets a

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.530 
sometimes especially as the RV gets a
little<00:00:38.040> bit<00:00:38.220> older<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.670> gets<00:00:38.910> worn<00:00:39.210> or<00:00:39.360> whatnot

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
little bit older it gets worn or whatnot

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.180 
little bit older it gets worn or whatnot
what<00:00:39.989> are<00:00:40.110> some<00:00:40.290> things<00:00:40.470> that<00:00:40.590> people<00:00:40.800> need<00:00:41.040> to

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
what are some things that people need to

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.850 
what are some things that people need to
look<00:00:41.400> for<00:00:41.730> as<00:00:42.210> far<00:00:42.480> as<00:00:42.690> plugging<00:00:43.050> their<00:00:43.320> RV<00:00:43.650> and

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
look for as far as plugging their RV and

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.070 
look for as far as plugging their RV and
maybe<00:00:44.100> some<00:00:44.370> good<00:00:44.519> points<00:00:44.970> to<00:00:45.629> help<00:00:45.809> protect

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:46.080 
maybe some good points to help protect

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.070 
maybe some good points to help protect
that<00:00:46.379> connection<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.879> maybe<00:00:48.750> when<00:00:48.930> they

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:49.080 
that connection and maybe when they

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.450 
that connection and maybe when they
should<00:00:49.230> have<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.440> connection<00:00:50.010> service<00:00:50.250> to

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
should have that connection service to

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.960 
should have that connection service to
replace<00:00:51.350> okay<00:00:52.350> I<00:00:52.769> think<00:00:53.309> one<00:00:53.549> of<00:00:53.580> the<00:00:53.729> things

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:53.970 
replace okay I think one of the things

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.110 
replace okay I think one of the things
that<00:00:54.420> damages<00:00:55.080> RV<00:00:55.650> power<00:00:55.949> plugs<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.549> most<00:00:56.850> is

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
that damages RV power plugs the most is

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.729 
that damages RV power plugs the most is
when<00:00:57.390> you're<00:00:57.510> plugging<00:00:57.780> them<00:00:58.170> in<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.619> out

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
when you're plugging them in and out

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.310 
when you're plugging them in and out
under<00:00:59.489> load<00:00:59.699> and<00:01:00.000> this<00:01:00.360> happens<00:01:00.809> any<00:01:01.019> time<00:01:01.290> a

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
under load and this happens any time a

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.710 
under load and this happens any time a
circuit<00:01:01.739> breaker<00:01:01.830> is<00:01:02.100> on<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.580> you<00:01:03.000> plug<00:01:03.299> into

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:03.720 
circuit breaker is on and you plug into

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.740 
circuit breaker is on and you plug into
the<00:01:04.440> pedestal<00:01:05.100> if<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.850> see<00:01:06.090> sparks<00:01:06.570> when

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
the pedestal if you see sparks when

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.080 
the pedestal if you see sparks when
you're<00:01:06.869> plugging<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.440> in<00:01:07.590> or<00:01:07.830> unplug<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.760> that

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
you're plugging it in or unplug it that

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.700 
you're plugging it in or unplug it that
means<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.659> there's<00:01:09.840> little<00:01:10.110> bits<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.409> copper

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
means that there's little bits of copper

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.130 
means that there's little bits of copper
from<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.280> blades<00:01:11.729> on<00:01:12.060> your<00:01:12.090> power<00:01:12.600> cords<00:01:13.020> are

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
from the blades on your power cords are

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.800 
from the blades on your power cords are
now<00:01:13.320> burning<00:01:14.189> up<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.460> going<00:01:14.670> away<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.180> you'll

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
now burning up and going away and you'll

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.539 
now burning up and going away and you'll
see<00:01:16.110> this<00:01:16.260> as<00:01:16.470> tiny<00:01:16.740> little<00:01:16.830> pitting<00:01:17.369> and

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
see this as tiny little pitting and

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.310 
see this as tiny little pitting and
eventually<00:01:18.030> it'll<00:01:18.270> kind<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.720> change<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.290> a

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
eventually it'll kind of change to a

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.560 
eventually it'll kind of change to a
dark<00:01:19.710> brownish<00:01:20.159> color

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
dark brownish color

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.170 
dark brownish color
that's<00:01:22.110> corrosion<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.010> corrosion<00:01:24.000> will

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
that's corrosion and corrosion will

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.480 
that's corrosion and corrosion will
increase<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:25.590> resistance<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:26.369> the

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
increase the resistance of the

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.609 
increase the resistance of the
connection<00:01:27.030> so<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.570> next<00:01:27.810> time<00:01:28.049> you<00:01:28.170> plug<00:01:28.409> in

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
connection so the next time you plug in

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.380 
connection so the next time you plug in
this<00:01:28.979> thing<00:01:29.250> will<00:01:29.369> get<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.520> little<00:01:29.700> hotter<00:01:30.030> and

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
this thing will get a little hotter and

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.539 
this thing will get a little hotter and
a<00:01:30.479> little<00:01:30.719> hotter<00:01:30.929> still<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.009> point<00:01:32.250> where

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
a little hotter still to the point where

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.389 
a little hotter still to the point where
it'll<00:01:32.880> eventually<00:01:33.679> either<00:01:34.679> disconnect

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
it'll eventually either disconnect

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:36.830 
it'll eventually either disconnect
itself<00:01:35.700> or<00:01:35.969> you'll<00:01:36.060> lose<00:01:36.210> connection<00:01:36.600> or

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
itself or you'll lose connection or

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.529 
itself or you'll lose connection or
it'll<00:01:37.350> catch<00:01:37.530> on<00:01:37.679> fire<00:01:37.950> so<00:01:38.850> if<00:01:38.939> you<00:01:39.030> look<00:01:39.210> at<00:01:39.390> it

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
it'll catch on fire so if you look at it

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:41.090 
it'll catch on fire so if you look at it
it's<00:01:39.719> not<00:01:39.810> bright<00:01:40.289> and<00:01:40.499> shiny

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
it's not bright and shiny

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.940 
it's not bright and shiny
that<00:01:41.670> means<00:01:41.999> it's<00:01:42.420> it's<00:01:43.049> getting<00:01:43.469> old<00:01:43.619> you

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
that means it's it's getting old you

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.959 
that means it's it's getting old you
there<00:01:44.219> are<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.460> number<00:01:44.759> of<00:01:45.530> dioxin

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:46.969 
there are a number of dioxin

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:49.130 
there are a number of dioxin
conditioners<00:01:47.969> that<00:01:48.060> you<00:01:48.210> can<00:01:48.359> that<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:48.960> can

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
conditioners that you can that you can

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.169 
conditioners that you can that you can
use<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.770> burnish<00:01:50.399> them<00:01:50.670> with<00:01:50.789> emery<00:01:51.149> paper

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:51.179 
use and burnish them with emery paper

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:53.569 
use and burnish them with emery paper
but<00:01:51.749> I<00:01:51.780> think<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.229> best<00:01:52.530> thing<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.770> do<00:01:53.009> is

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
but I think the best thing to do is

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.450 
but I think the best thing to do is
always<00:01:53.969> make<00:01:54.149> sure<00:01:54.380> always<00:01:55.380> make<00:01:55.590> sure<00:01:55.799> that

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
always make sure always make sure that

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.550 
always make sure always make sure that
your<00:01:56.939> circuit<00:01:57.420> breaker<00:01:57.600> on<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:57.929> pedestal<00:01:58.380> is

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
your circuit breaker on the pedestal is

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.010 
your circuit breaker on the pedestal is
powered<00:01:59.039> off<00:01:59.189> when<00:01:59.939> you<00:02:00.060> unplug

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
powered off when you unplug

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.819 
powered off when you unplug
or<00:02:01.710> when<00:02:01.890> you<00:02:02.009> plug<00:02:02.250> in<00:02:02.990> and<00:02:03.990> then<00:02:04.320> also

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
or when you plug in and then also

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.010 
or when you plug in and then also
inspect<00:02:05.399> it<00:02:05.520> every<00:02:05.700> time<00:02:05.880> if<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.210> see<00:02:06.479> any

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
inspect it every time if you see any

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.229

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
that kind of heat damage you'll actually

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.220 
that kind of heat damage you'll actually
see<00:02:49.799> the<00:02:49.980> plastic<00:02:50.610> around<00:02:51.150> it<00:02:51.600> will<00:02:52.019> actually

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
see the plastic around it will actually

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.670 
see the plastic around it will actually
be<00:02:52.590> melted<00:02:53.040> you'll<00:02:53.220> see<00:02:53.610> kind<00:02:54.150> of<00:02:54.330> little

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
be melted you'll see kind of little

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.110 
be melted you'll see kind of little
it'll<00:02:55.680> turn<00:02:55.799> brownish<00:02:56.130> right<00:02:56.790> around<00:02:56.970> the

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
it'll turn brownish right around the

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.390 
it'll turn brownish right around the
edges<00:02:57.239> from<00:02:57.569> the<00:02:57.660> heat<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:58.470> metal<00:02:58.830> itself

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
edges from the heat the metal itself

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.120 
edges from the heat the metal itself
will<00:02:59.970> kind<00:03:00.209> of<00:03:00.330> take<00:03:00.569> on<00:03:00.900> kind<00:03:01.349> of<00:03:01.530> a<00:03:01.650> patina

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
will kind of take on kind of a patina

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.110 
will kind of take on kind of a patina
like<00:03:02.489> a<00:03:02.519> dark<00:03:02.849> bronze<00:03:03.260> color<00:03:04.340> it<00:03:05.340> won't<00:03:05.640> be<00:03:05.880> a

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
like a dark bronze color it won't be a

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.720 
like a dark bronze color it won't be a
uniform<00:03:06.660> color<00:03:06.900> and<00:03:07.200> this<00:03:07.290> is<00:03:07.530> basically<00:03:08.250> any

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
uniform color and this is basically any

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.040 
uniform color and this is basically any
time<00:03:09.000> you've<00:03:09.150> got<00:03:09.180> metal<00:03:09.570> heated<00:03:09.989> up

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
time you've got metal heated up

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.020 
time you've got metal heated up
you'll<00:03:11.680> start<00:03:11.950> to<00:03:12.040> see<00:03:12.190> this<00:03:12.340> oxide<00:03:12.820> on<00:03:13.000> the

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
you'll start to see this oxide on the

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.480 
you'll start to see this oxide on the
surface<00:03:13.120> so<00:03:13.600> if<00:03:13.780> it's<00:03:13.960> dark<00:03:14.290> brown<00:03:14.440> that<00:03:14.890> means

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:15.490 
surface so if it's dark brown that means

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.940 
surface so if it's dark brown that means
its<00:03:16.060> corrosion<00:03:16.780> and<00:03:17.050> that<00:03:17.350> corrosion<00:03:17.650> was

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
its corrosion and that corrosion was

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.790 
its corrosion and that corrosion was
generally<00:03:18.370> caused<00:03:18.580> by<00:03:19.030> heat<00:03:19.750> the<00:03:20.320> other<00:03:20.530> thing

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
generally caused by heat the other thing

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.100 
generally caused by heat the other thing
that<00:03:20.830> I<00:03:21.040> will<00:03:21.160> let<00:03:21.400> you<00:03:21.520> know<00:03:21.670> is<00:03:21.880> don't<00:03:22.870> take

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
that I will let you know is don't take

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.810 
that I will let you know is don't take

10<00:03:58.930> gauge<00:03:59.140> is<00:03:59.440> good<00:03:59.620> for<00:03:59.800> 30<00:04:00.010> amps<00:04:00.400> a<00:04:00.490> 12<00:04:00.760> gauge

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
10 gauge is good for 30 amps a 12 gauge

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.380 
10 gauge is good for 30 amps a 12 gauge
is<00:04:01.420> good<00:04:01.600> basically<00:04:01.780> for<00:04:02.200> 20<00:04:02.500> amps<00:04:02.920> and<00:04:03.070> a<00:04:03.390> 16

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
is good basically for 20 amps and a 16
