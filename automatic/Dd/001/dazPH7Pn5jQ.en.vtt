00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.200
 for 2013 home who launched the 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:13.630
 ninja 636 but keeping on the market 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.730
 even the old super-fast 600 like 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.470
 never the new super sport and it turns out a little 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.940
 easier to take to the limit while 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.190
 the previous model would be the choice 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.779
 best for the most experienced chassis riders 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:24.580
 and swingarm of the new 6 3 without no 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:25.630
 the same as the 600 but otherwise it is 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.070
 a whole new bike 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.539
 the engine has a long list of 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.220
 changes the most important of which 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:33.640
 is the major race that leads to 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.769
 displacement 600 36 cubic centimeters chen 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.620
 evolved electronics inherited from the zx 

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:40.989
 10r traction mapping and ea 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.819
 request the biesse are new brakes i 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:44.199
 look for the shock suspension department 

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:46.210
 no adjustment for high and low 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:49.199
 speed for mono is a single register 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.199
 for each fork stereo 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.500
 movement guided by amateur rhythms 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:20.049
 they are two bikes that convey feelings to you 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.640
 very similar excellent stability 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:23.530
 the firm and precise front end that you 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.460
 wait for an effective giving kasasaki 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.090
 braking in the good one 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.090
 maneuverability 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.560
 what undoubtedly makes the most 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.910
 easy if 36 and the engine with more 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.470
 couple that pulls you out of the curves 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.510
 even intermediate schemes forgive you 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.770
 some mistakes and then there is the check 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:13.390
 liberation from security 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.260
 necessary to give gas without too many 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.270
 concerns 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.990
 who puts a piece when that gas comes from 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.990
 open too early 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:39.340
 the 600 and paris from you realize it 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.280
 right away but just as less 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.569
 to take advantage of the 4 in line less back 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.879
 and if you do n't make it run around a curve 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.440
 find yourself planted out and then you have to 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:49.690
 always take into account that the gas is at 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.640
 you make one hundred percent in your hands 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.400
 account that they will go very strong but 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.110
 from there to do it however when the game 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.150
 it gets hard the scale hangs from his 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.099
 part has a more suitable arrangement for 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.379
 push allows you to brake for an instant 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:03.879
 after that it accelerates a moment before 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:05.410
 the less horsepower engine is true but 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:06.790
 it stretches better and this together 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.530
 at the most effective curve exit 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.579
 allows you to get a bit more 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.579
 strong infuse tin.it 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:34.760
 on the 6 series the limit is reached more 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.800
 quickly if you are able to drive 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.320
 really strong in the brakes more 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.090
 violent you understand that the vs inter summit e 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.670
 speed up a lot in advance tends to 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.380
 sit widening the trajectory a little 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:48.400
 a few tenths of the 600 birth 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.400
 road every lap
