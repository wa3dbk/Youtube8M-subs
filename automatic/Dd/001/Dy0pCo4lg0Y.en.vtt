so<00:02:10.890> you<00:02:10.979> can<00:02:11.189> just<00:02:11.370> experiment<00:02:11.879> and<00:02:12.299> see

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
so you can just experiment and see

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.629 
so you can just experiment and see
exactly<00:02:12.599> what<00:02:13.139> type<00:02:13.319> of<00:02:13.349> sound<00:02:13.680> you<00:02:13.980> want<00:02:14.280> and

exactly what type of sound you want and

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:17.209 
exactly what type of sound you want and
then<00:02:14.670> just<00:02:15.569> write<00:02:15.780> it<00:02:15.900> down<00:02:16.049> on<00:02:16.409> a<00:02:16.950> piece<00:02:17.040> of

then just write it down on a piece of

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:19.550 
then just write it down on a piece of

paper on the music that you're using and

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.470

eventually<00:02:20.400> you've<00:02:20.549> come<00:02:20.730> up<00:02:20.760> with<00:02:20.909> something

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
eventually you've come up with something

eventually you've come up with something
with<00:02:21.900> a<00:02:22.560> sound<00:02:23.249> like<00:02:23.519> this<00:02:23.730> possibly
