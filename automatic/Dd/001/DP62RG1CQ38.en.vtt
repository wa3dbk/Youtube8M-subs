00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
changed the sound of the mic I was using

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.310 
changed the sound of the mic I was using
on<00:01:22.860> those<00:01:23.100> female<00:01:23.520> vocalists<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.689> was<00:01:25.020> like

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
on those female vocalists it was like

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.440 
on those female vocalists it was like
being<00:01:25.710> able<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:26.009> audition<00:01:26.880> slightly
