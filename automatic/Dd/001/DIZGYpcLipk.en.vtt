to adapt to the flooding that will be
happening<00:00:33.780> in<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.440> area<00:00:34.739> in<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.890> future<00:00:35.219> fee

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
happening in the area in the future fee

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.910 
happening in the area in the future fee
and<00:00:35.780> one<00:00:36.780> of<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.960> things<00:00:36.989> that<00:00:37.350> we<00:00:37.410> discovered

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
and one of the things that we discovered

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.430 
and one of the things that we discovered
going<00:00:38.309> around<00:00:38.550> marikina<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.300> that<00:00:39.480> residents

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
going around marikina is that residents

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.490 
going around marikina is that residents
in<00:00:41.309> general<00:00:41.850> we're<00:00:42.510> trying<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.780> find<00:00:42.960> ways<00:00:43.230> to

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
in general we're trying to find ways to

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.279 
in general we're trying to find ways to
be<00:00:43.590> able<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.920> build<00:00:44.129> either<00:00:44.760> higher<00:00:45.120> or<00:00:45.289> have

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
be able to build either higher or have

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.400 
be able to build either higher or have
some<00:00:47.039> sort<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.309> escape<00:00:48.050> mechanism<00:00:49.050> I<00:00:49.200> think

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
some sort of escape mechanism I think

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.500 
some sort of escape mechanism I think
all<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.559> those<00:00:49.739> things<00:00:49.800> are<00:00:50.250> valid<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:50.760> we

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
all of those things are valid and we

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.139 
all of those things are valid and we
have<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.719> take<00:00:51.899> them<00:00:52.079> into<00:00:52.879> consideration<00:00:53.879> but

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
have to take them into consideration but

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.639 
have to take them into consideration but
I<00:00:54.329> think<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.660> first<00:00:54.840> one<00:00:55.020> that<00:00:55.170> we<00:00:55.350> have<00:00:55.469> to

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
I think the first one that we have to

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.770 
I think the first one that we have to
address<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.640> supply<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:56.969> water<00:00:57.239> okay

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
address is the supply of water okay

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.150 
address is the supply of water okay
because<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.230> lot<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.410> people<00:00:58.530> were<00:00:58.890> stuck<00:00:59.129> in

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
because a lot of people were stuck in

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.250 
because a lot of people were stuck in
their<00:00:59.399> houses<00:00:59.579> you<00:01:00.059> know<00:01:00.120> they<00:01:00.300> have<00:01:00.449> water

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
their houses you know they have water

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.080 
their houses you know they have water
all<00:01:01.530> over<00:01:01.559> there<00:01:01.949> it's<00:01:02.280> basically<00:01:02.640> flooded

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
all over there it's basically flooded

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.700 
all over there it's basically flooded
but<00:01:03.239> a<00:01:03.300> bad<00:01:03.570> time<00:01:03.780> yeah<00:01:04.170> they<00:01:04.350> didn't<00:01:04.589> have

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
but a bad time yeah they didn't have

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.210 
but a bad time yeah they didn't have
what<00:01:04.890> happen<00:01:05.309> soon<00:01:06.470> second<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:07.590> a

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
what happen soon second is a

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.780 
what happen soon second is a
communication<00:01:09.229> you<00:01:10.229> know<00:01:10.400> they<00:01:11.400> were<00:01:11.460> stuck

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
communication you know they were stuck

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.850 
communication you know they were stuck
and<00:01:12.090> they<00:01:12.420> couldn't<00:01:12.659> communicate<00:01:13.439> with

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
and they couldn't communicate with

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.920 
and they couldn't communicate with
anyone<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.340> ask<00:01:14.490> for<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:15.630> know<00:01:15.689> somebody

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
anyone and ask for you know somebody

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.899 
anyone and ask for you know somebody
else<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.320> save<00:01:16.500> them<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.520> think<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.790> most

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
else to save them and I think the most

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.450 
else to save them and I think the most
important<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.689> access<00:01:19.170> because<00:01:19.680> they

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
important is access because they

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.850 
important is access because they
couldn't<00:01:20.640> be<00:01:20.820> saved<00:01:21.060> because<00:01:21.590> you<00:01:22.590> know<00:01:22.680> there

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
couldn't be saved because you know there

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.499 
couldn't be saved because you know there
was<00:01:22.950> no<00:01:23.070> access<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.490> simply<00:01:24.180> where<00:01:24.299> they<00:01:24.450> were

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
was no access to simply where they were

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.510 
was no access to simply where they were
so<00:01:25.110> we<00:01:25.530> have<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.770> provide<00:01:26.009> some<00:01:26.250> sort<00:01:26.400> of

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
so we have to provide some sort of

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.270 
so we have to provide some sort of
escape<00:01:26.909> yeah<00:01:27.210> whether<00:01:28.049> you<00:01:28.500> know<00:01:28.619> it's<00:01:28.890> just

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
escape yeah whether you know it's just

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.069 
escape yeah whether you know it's just
proved<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.939> get<00:01:30.090> from<00:01:30.299> room<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.659> room<00:01:30.689> or<00:01:30.960> to

architects<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:43.049> continue<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.799> bring<00:01:44.159> the

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
architects to continue and bring the

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.460 
architects to continue and bring the
vision<00:01:44.759> to<00:01:44.970> life<00:01:45.149> we<00:01:45.869> really<00:01:46.140> drew

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
vision to life we really drew

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.410 
vision to life we really drew
inspiration<00:01:46.649> from

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
inspiration from

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.710 
inspiration from
people<00:01:48.780> who<00:01:48.869> are<00:01:48.990> affected<00:01:49.430> during<00:01:50.430> in<00:01:51.390> all<00:01:51.570> of

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
people who are affected during in all of

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.740 
people who are affected during in all of
these<00:01:51.840> storms<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.590> we<00:01:53.040> really<00:01:53.369> I<00:01:53.640> guess<00:01:54.119> drew

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
these storms and we really I guess drew

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.390 
these storms and we really I guess drew

it by kind of mirroring for copying you
know<00:03:14.640> it's<00:03:14.850> the<00:03:15.120> way<00:03:15.269> it<00:03:15.390> moves<00:03:15.660> the<00:03:16.350> way<00:03:16.560> it

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
know it's the way it moves the way it

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.090 
know it's the way it moves the way it
behaves<00:03:16.799> the<00:03:17.700> first<00:03:17.970> thing<00:03:18.500> is<00:03:19.500> we<00:03:19.560> plotted

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
behaves the first thing is we plotted

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.759 
behaves the first thing is we plotted
the<00:03:20.310> flood<00:03:20.519> level<00:03:20.880> area<00:03:21.470> which<00:03:22.470> is<00:03:22.590> about

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
the flood level area which is about

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.130 
the flood level area which is about
eight<00:03:22.950> feet<00:03:23.190> flood<00:03:23.609> level<00:03:23.970> basically<00:03:24.180> eats<00:03:24.870> up

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
eight feet flood level basically eats up

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.890 
eight feet flood level basically eats up
the<00:03:25.170> entire<00:03:25.530> first<00:03:26.280> floor<00:03:26.489> and<00:03:26.790> so<00:03:27.540> the<00:03:27.660> first

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
the entire first floor and so the first

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:29.539 
the entire first floor and so the first
thing<00:03:27.959> that<00:03:28.049> we<00:03:28.260> did<00:03:28.470> is<00:03:28.739> we<00:03:28.769> erase<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.519> entire

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
thing that we did is we erase the entire

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.539 
thing that we did is we erase the entire
house<00:03:30.060> right<00:03:31.019> to<00:03:31.200> be<00:03:31.319> sort<00:03:31.680> of<00:03:31.709> on<00:03:31.829> stilts<00:03:32.160> just

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
house right to be sort of on stilts just

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.059 
house right to be sort of on stilts just
like<00:03:32.700> the<00:03:32.819> Bible<00:03:32.940> I<00:03:33.510> think<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:33.870> most<00:03:34.069> unique

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
like the Bible I think the most unique

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:38.000 
like the Bible I think the most unique
idea<00:03:35.400> that<00:03:35.609> you<00:03:35.700> came<00:03:35.940> up<00:03:36.150> with<00:03:36.420> or<00:03:36.829> what<00:03:37.829> we

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
idea that you came up with or what we

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.270 
idea that you came up with or what we
chose<00:03:38.400> to<00:03:38.430> call<00:03:38.700> rafts<00:03:39.269> for<00:03:39.540> regenerative

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
chose to call rafts for regenerative

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.229 
chose to call rafts for regenerative
amphibious<00:03:42.109> floating<00:03:43.109> terraces<00:03:43.650> and<00:03:44.239> they're

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
amphibious floating terraces and they're

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.000 
amphibious floating terraces and they're
essentially<00:03:45.750> floating<00:03:46.170> rafts<00:03:46.560> so<00:03:46.859> it's

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
essentially floating rafts so it's

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.129 
essentially floating rafts so it's
essentially<00:03:47.519> balconies<00:03:48.060> that<00:03:48.450> can<00:03:48.630> float<00:03:48.870> and

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.139 
essentially balconies that can float and

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:52.250 
essentially balconies that can float and
can<00:03:49.980> be<00:03:50.100> detached<00:03:50.400> so<00:03:51.060> you're<00:03:51.239> never<00:03:51.480> caught

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
can be detached so you're never caught

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.690 
can be detached so you're never caught
at<00:03:52.410> a<00:03:52.470> moment<00:03:52.829> where<00:03:52.950> you're<00:03:53.130> stuck<00:03:53.430> in<00:03:53.579> your

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
at a moment where you're stuck in your

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:54.680 
at a moment where you're stuck in your
own<00:03:53.850> house

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
own house

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.210 
own house

even one of the cardboard can actually

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.550 
even one of the cardboard can actually
be<00:03:57.340> converted<00:03:57.880> into<00:03:58.030> a<00:03:58.180> sort<00:03:58.390> of<00:03:58.450> raft<00:03:58.720> which

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
be converted into a sort of raft which

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.490 
be converted into a sort of raft which
can<00:03:59.770> also<00:03:59.920> you<00:04:00.370> know<00:04:00.490> float<00:04:00.760> a<00:04:01.000> hiring<00:04:01.500> during

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
can also you know float a hiring during

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.910 
can also you know float a hiring during
the<00:04:02.680> dream<00:04:03.130> Wow<00:04:03.520> God<00:04:04.330> gave<00:04:04.570> me<00:04:04.750> no<00:04:05.140> no<00:04:05.410> no<00:04:05.620> yeah

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
the dream Wow God gave me no no no yeah

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.070 
the dream Wow God gave me no no no yeah
it's<00:04:06.850> going<00:04:07.030> to<00:04:07.090> float<00:04:07.240> the<00:04:07.390> car<00:04:07.660> will<00:04:07.840> float

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
it's going to float the car will float

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.870 
it's going to float the car will float
yeah<00:04:08.530> that's<00:04:08.860> my<00:04:08.980> intent<00:04:09.340> that's<00:04:09.520> like<00:04:09.730> that

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:09.880 
yeah that's my intent that's like that

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.580 
yeah that's my intent that's like that
and<00:04:10.030> we<00:04:10.150> have<00:04:10.240> calculations<00:04:10.900> to<00:04:11.050> support<00:04:11.410> them

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
and we have calculations to support them

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.650 
and we have calculations to support them
for<00:04:12.040> the<00:04:12.190> floating<00:04:12.580> that<00:04:12.850> shall<00:04:13.090> we<00:04:13.210> intend<00:04:13.510> to

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
for the floating that shall we intend to

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.319 
for the floating that shall we intend to
use<00:04:13.840> our<00:04:14.110> buttons<00:04:14.560> that<00:04:15.340> has<00:04:15.490> the<00:04:15.670> capacity<00:04:15.820> to

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
use our buttons that has the capacity to

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:19.920 
use our buttons that has the capacity to
carry<00:04:17.310> 435<00:04:18.310> point<00:04:18.670> six<00:04:18.910> pounds<00:04:19.329> to<00:04:19.510> mix<00:04:19.720> up

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
carry 435 point six pounds to mix up

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.680 
carry 435 point six pounds to mix up
more<00:04:20.799> that's<00:04:21.010> engineer<00:04:21.370> how<00:04:21.519> many<00:04:21.700> drums<00:04:22.480> will

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
more that's engineer how many drums will

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.110 
more that's engineer how many drums will
it<00:04:22.780> take<00:04:22.960> to<00:04:22.990> float<00:04:23.410> a<00:04:23.800> standard<00:04:24.490> car<00:04:24.700> maybe<00:04:25.000> an

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
it take to float a standard car maybe an

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.250 
it take to float a standard car maybe an
SUV<00:04:25.420> of<00:04:25.600> us<00:04:25.810> for<00:04:26.770> ASU<00:04:27.310> would<00:04:27.430> be<00:04:27.550> that<00:04:27.760> weighs

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
SUV of us for ASU would be that weighs

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.220 
SUV of us for ASU would be that weighs
5,500<00:04:29.260> pounds<00:04:29.500> really<00:04:30.190> that<00:04:30.370> least<00:04:31.230> forte

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
5,500 pounds really that least forte

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:37.170 
5,500 pounds really that least forte
drums<00:04:32.620> to<00:04:33.040> make<00:04:33.190> it<00:04:33.370> afloat<00:04:35.910> this<00:04:36.910> is<00:04:37.060> an

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
drums to make it afloat this is an

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.030 
drums to make it afloat this is an
aerial<00:04:37.540> view<00:04:37.570> of<00:04:37.780> the<00:04:37.930> ground<00:04:38.170> floor<00:04:38.320> just

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:39.040 
aerial view of the ground floor just

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.830 
aerial view of the ground floor just
essentially<00:04:39.520> your<00:04:39.640> open<00:04:39.940> space<00:04:40.180> or<00:04:40.420> a<00:04:40.450> coelom

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:40.840 
essentially your open space or a coelom

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:42.630 
essentially your open space or a coelom
so<00:04:40.990> you<00:04:41.080> can<00:04:41.200> have<00:04:41.320> parties<00:04:41.860> there<00:04:42.100> and<00:04:42.430> then

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:42.640 
so you can have parties there and then

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.550 
so you can have parties there and then
you<00:04:42.730> just<00:04:42.880> have<00:04:43.060> a<00:04:43.090> basic<00:04:43.510> access<00:04:43.930> you<00:04:44.320> know<00:04:44.440> so

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
you just have a basic access you know so

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.040 
you just have a basic access you know so
you<00:04:44.620> have<00:04:44.770> your<00:04:44.800> front<00:04:45.190> foyer<00:04:45.880> which<00:04:46.630> leads<00:04:46.930> to

you have your front foyer which leads to
the<00:04:47.169> staircase<00:04:47.680> going<00:04:47.890> up<00:04:48.070> which<00:04:48.820> leads<00:04:49.150> us

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
the staircase going up which leads us

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.560 
the staircase going up which leads us
now<00:04:49.540> to<00:04:49.600> the<00:04:49.960> second<00:04:50.800> floor<00:04:50.890> of<00:04:51.010> the<00:04:51.220> space<00:04:51.570> we

now to the second floor of the space we

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.630 
now to the second floor of the space we
switched<00:04:52.900> the<00:04:53.140> private<00:04:53.620> you<00:04:54.070> know<00:04:54.100> function

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.640 
switched the private you know function

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.700 
switched the private you know function
which<00:04:55.450> are<00:04:55.600> basically<00:04:55.750> the<00:04:56.020> bedrooms<00:04:56.500> from

which are basically the bedrooms from

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.110 
which are basically the bedrooms from
the<00:04:56.800> upper<00:04:57.040> floors<00:04:57.310> to<00:04:57.490> the<00:04:57.550> lower<00:04:57.760> floors

the upper floors to the lower floors

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.900 
the upper floors to the lower floors
this<00:04:58.690> is<00:04:58.840> the<00:04:58.930> third<00:04:59.110> floor<00:04:59.350> of<00:04:59.410> the<00:04:59.620> house

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
this is the third floor of the house

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.060 
this is the third floor of the house
it's<00:05:00.910> essentially<00:05:01.360> one<00:05:01.540> big<00:05:01.720> open<00:05:02.050> space<00:05:02.320> you

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
it's essentially one big open space you

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.430 
it's essentially one big open space you
have<00:05:03.160> your<00:05:03.310> living<00:05:03.580> area<00:05:03.790> your<00:05:04.240> dining<00:05:04.450> and

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
have your living area your dining and

have your living area your dining and
your<00:05:05.590> kitchen<00:05:06.010> and<00:05:06.250> the<00:05:06.460> small<00:05:06.669> bathroom<00:05:07.240> and

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
your kitchen and the small bathroom and

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:10.350 
your kitchen and the small bathroom and
you<00:05:08.470> know<00:05:08.590> it's<00:05:08.770> just<00:05:08.950> the<00:05:09.100> one<00:05:09.520> contiguous

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
you know it's just the one contiguous

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.870 
you know it's just the one contiguous
space<00:05:10.600> again<00:05:11.560> allowing<00:05:12.070> people<00:05:12.370> or<00:05:12.760> the

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:12.880 
space again allowing people or the

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.460 
space again allowing people or the
family<00:05:13.090> filter<00:05:13.510> out<00:05:13.720> for<00:05:13.930> each<00:05:14.050> other<00:05:14.229> and

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
family filter out for each other and

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:16.409 
family filter out for each other and
that<00:05:15.160> it<00:05:15.340> makes<00:05:15.460> sense<00:05:15.610> also<00:05:15.850> because<00:05:16.180> most<00:05:16.360> of

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:16.419 
that it makes sense also because most of

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:18.650 
that it makes sense also because most of
your<00:05:16.570> appliances<00:05:17.169> your<00:05:17.440> raft<00:05:17.680> your<00:05:17.950> food

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
your appliances your raft your food

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.719 
your appliances your raft your food
they're<00:05:19.660> on<00:05:19.720> the<00:05:19.810> third<00:05:19.990> floor<00:05:20.140> yeah

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:20.729 
they're on the third floor yeah

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:23.190 
they're on the third floor yeah
essentially<00:05:21.729> that's<00:05:22.030> all<00:05:22.300> I<00:05:22.720> think<00:05:23.110> your

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:23.200 
essentially that's all I think your

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.750 
essentially that's all I think your
supplies<00:05:23.500> that's<00:05:23.710> all<00:05:23.860> say<00:05:24.010> yeah<00:05:24.250> not<00:05:24.520> safe

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:24.760 
supplies that's all say yeah not safe

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.120 
supplies that's all say yeah not safe
but<00:05:25.450> you<00:05:25.720> know<00:05:25.840> above<00:05:26.169> the<00:05:26.320> third<00:05:26.500> floor<00:05:26.890> we

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
but you know above the third floor we

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:28.920 
but you know above the third floor we
propose<00:05:27.460> that<00:05:27.820> there's<00:05:28.330> still<00:05:28.419> be<00:05:28.690> a<00:05:28.720> group

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
propose that there's still be a group

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.230 
propose that there's still be a group
thing<00:05:28.960> okay<00:05:29.620> so<00:05:30.460> it's<00:05:30.580> essentially<00:05:30.850> a<00:05:30.970> fourth

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
thing okay so it's essentially a fourth

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.980 
thing okay so it's essentially a fourth
floor<00:05:31.479> /<00:05:31.840> roof<00:05:32.080> deck<00:05:32.350> right<00:05:32.560> and<00:05:32.830> this<00:05:33.760> is<00:05:33.990> your

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
floor / roof deck right and this is your

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.960 
floor / roof deck right and this is your
stairwell<00:05:35.500> access<00:05:35.979> and<00:05:36.220> what<00:05:36.370> it<00:05:36.460> does<00:05:36.640> is<00:05:36.940> it

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:36.970 
stairwell access and what it does is it

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.080 
stairwell access and what it does is it
becomes<00:05:37.600> escape<00:05:38.380> for<00:05:38.560> hot<00:05:38.680> air<00:05:38.890> also<00:05:39.100> it's<00:05:40.030> not

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 
becomes escape for hot air also it's not

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.050 
becomes escape for hot air also it's not
only<00:05:40.479> access<00:05:40.960> but<00:05:41.290> it<00:05:41.530> allows<00:05:41.890> stack<00:05:42.250> effect

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.060 
only access but it allows stack effect

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.230 
only access but it allows stack effect
and<00:05:44.500> again<00:05:45.500> it's<00:05:45.650> one<00:05:45.800> big<00:05:45.950> space<00:05:46.310> wherein<00:05:46.970> you

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 
and again it's one big space wherein you

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.810 
and again it's one big space wherein you
can<00:05:47.270> possibly<00:05:47.780> put<00:05:48.320> the<00:05:48.620> your<00:05:49.520> rainwater
