00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
was the one that that actually made the

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.510 
was the one that that actually made the
virus<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:29.250> was<00:01:29.400> quite<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.119> shock<00:01:30.450> but<00:01:31.049> also

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
virus that was quite the shock but also

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.580 
virus that was quite the shock but also
what<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:32.549> learned<00:01:32.820> from<00:01:32.939> that<00:01:33.060> was<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.590> it

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
what I learned from that was that it

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.960 
what I learned from that was that it
wasn't<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:35.159> know<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.340> wasn't<00:01:35.490> her<00:01:35.670> thought

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
wasn't you know it wasn't her thought

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.359 
wasn't you know it wasn't her thought
that<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:36.240> world<00:01:36.420> ended<00:01:36.780> well<00:01:37.049> in<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.290> show<00:01:37.470> it

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
that the world ended well in the show it

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.039 
that the world ended well in the show it
was<00:01:38.520> pretty<00:01:39.000> much<00:01:39.180> ignorance<00:01:39.420> of<00:01:39.840> man

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
was pretty much ignorance of man

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.330 
was pretty much ignorance of man
thinking<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:40.680> they<00:01:40.770> could<00:01:40.920> do<00:01:41.040> what<00:01:41.220> they

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
thinking that they could do what they

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.969 
thinking that they could do what they
want<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:41.970> when<00:01:42.960> dr.<00:01:43.259> K<00:01:43.380> tried<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.649> stop<00:01:43.860> the

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
want and when dr. K tried to stop the

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.639 
want and when dr. K tried to stop the
