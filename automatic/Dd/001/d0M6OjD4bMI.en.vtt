 playful cardiovascular training 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.019
 with table tennis rackets and at too 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:34.370
 make that comparable effects as 

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:36.680
 having the walking 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.940
 The University of Magdeburg has this in 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.940
 scientific studies 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.820
 with a movement ritual that the 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.650

 sports equipment connected 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.619
 a versatile movement learning 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:15.540
 promotes safety in the movement 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:17.030
 everyday life in small tests we experience very much 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.100
 often that in untrained 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.290
 Participating already about 40 years of life 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.200
 the coordinative skills like 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.030
 for example, the equilibrium or 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.340
 reactivity already subside 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.899
 these two skills are, however 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.940
 important for safety in motion 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:34.710
 everyday life 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.780
 In addition, most accidents happen 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.850
 happen when two things at the same time 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.259
 be made 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.690
 so we have a versatile one

 ball 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.080
 that cognitive skills 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:53.240
 reactivated or to learn new 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.240
 playfully invites movement forms 

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:58.630
 the playful cardiovascular training

 Exercise heart rate can move 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.530
 impulse measurements and the lead one 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.480
