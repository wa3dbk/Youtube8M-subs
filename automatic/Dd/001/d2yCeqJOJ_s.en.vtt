00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
shackles in the front bumper there I

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:48.020 
shackles in the front bumper there I
gotta<00:04:42.590> get<00:04:42.710> a<00:04:42.770> set<00:04:43.249> of<00:04:43.279> those

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.770

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.340 

again<00:04:54.780> i<00:04:54.900> really<00:04:55.170> like<00:04:55.260> this<00:04:55.350> bumper<00:04:55.710> because

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
again i really like this bumper because

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.450 
again i really like this bumper because
it's<00:04:58.350> the<00:04:58.470> whole<00:04:58.620> length<00:04:58.800> of<00:04:58.950> the<00:04:59.010> body<00:04:59.220> and

00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 
it's the whole length of the body and

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.600 
it's the whole length of the body and
then<00:05:00.000> it<00:05:00.150> bumps<00:05:00.480> up<00:05:00.630> over<00:05:01.230> tired<00:05:01.530> so<00:05:02.370> you<00:05:02.460> have

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
then it bumps up over tired so you have

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.020 
then it bumps up over tired so you have
more<00:05:02.760> clearance<00:05:03.120> for<00:05:03.450> rocks<00:05:04.520> so<00:05:05.520> i<00:05:05.550> really

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
more clearance for rocks so i really

more clearance for rocks so i really
like<00:05:06.210> that
