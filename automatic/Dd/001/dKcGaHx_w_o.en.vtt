00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:10.410
 good with me here in the studio to Jorge 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.539
 martínez jorge came to usa in a table 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.150
 of surfing something that looks like movies 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:19.890
 science fiction but it's true you came 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:22.439
 that the USA three weeks ago 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.289
 approximately we had another of the 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.119
 young that I get here henry 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.130
 no interference the name was with 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.410
 us and unfortunately the third 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.150
 duarte was repatriated to Cuba but good 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.190
 Jorge is with us we give him with 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.170
 our chef how good you are here 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.629
 tell us a bit about where they come from 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.239
 as they arise the 13 were known as 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.430
 this good idea comes up I'm going to ride in 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.410
 a table to get here wee made 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.199
 a long time that I wanted to be here 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.030
 this country offers many opportunities and 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:55.160
 well I had no other way is very difficult 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:58.640
 leave and then I came up with that 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:01.910
 28 and that idea 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.110
 I started to plan I increased I saw that 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.300
 those teams that reach enough 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.700
 speed and then nothing bought 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.659
 initially a very cheap equipment 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.659
 when that team says 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.920
 It is a team because it consists of several 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.050
 the table with the candle all all those 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.360
 things and I started to see what possibilities 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.630
 had first train in water in a 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.850
 channel and then I went out to the open sea and there 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.490
 background in person the story I imagine 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.830
 that how they prepared themselves like me 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.140
 really prepared me is to say how 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:36.950
 only with my cousin we train with myself 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:39.360
 I prepared my resistance ran nothing 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.640
 many times they threw the right day 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.320
 they knew in which direction the wind was going 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.450
 when this activity is already going all those 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.780
 things I was always aware of 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.610
 how it worked times the wind 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.409
 climate as it changed in the strait of the 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.050
 Florida is a dangerous place 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.750
 the storms are loving cattle are 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.549
 local storms that can get you 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.100
 you can die and I started to follow the 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.440
 nine months time studying as 9na 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.630
 the sun is orienting better how it works 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:09.090
 if in case it was with a 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.959
 break to guide me at night all 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.080
 those things 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:17.400
 well I had gps I did not have any resources 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:20.370
 from henri if he had a compass phone 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.440
 a phone a samsung phone that with 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.930
 a software that are called habiten 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.920
 but but I only had the map of 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:31.230
 Cuba is not cover us and I 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.300
 more landmarks where 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.340
 could guide there are bones for the turtle 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.100
 80 kilometers in the middle so that 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.560
 I was lost tell me the moment 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.239
 what they say good today is today 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.740
 we go out they all three in the same 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.360
 what time was it 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.520
 on the night of that day I was 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.920
 long overdue although it is not 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.230
 any day has to be a day like 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.760
 what specific has to be narrow 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.650
 from the clean florida there had to be a 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.990
 air between 10 and 25 kilometers is not 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.900
 it can happen because you can not with the 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.340
 team is very very hard the crossing to me 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.010
 It took me a while to get complicated in 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:11.910
 medium and if sea percent and peak 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:13.080
 miles had already advanced I had no 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.730
 delays that I had 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:18.090
 this time the three together in some 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.890
 moment until they separate they come if they do not 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.960
 you know one of the wind started to get 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.720
 too strong and in seas well well 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:26.670
 very dangerous and you talk but I do not know 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.280
 listen you have to scream and almost one does not 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.350
 hey and nerves from everything all that 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.210
 it was happening it was very well strong 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.690
 the crossing was due to all the time 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:38.910
 9 - dies 4 days in 4 10 at night in 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:43.380
 the middle of stars shore as it is 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:47.450
 I miss 384 days how are those nights 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.450
 that is must be there 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:55.920
 you said always had I did not stop 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.350
 I had that faith that today what does not go 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.570
 could was sometimes I stayed mine and the 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.520
 same only one low of the table by 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:04.380
 the fatigue had no water I did not have 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.170
 food and up to try again 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:11.280
 I went back to hold the mast and with the 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:13.980
 rowing with more type that was like this is 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.330
 three nights and four days there are some 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.180
 moment explains 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.989
 the night and start I did not see any water 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.530
 at night 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:24.060
 like a forest beside me and 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:26.100
 stars were hanging I knew that 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.500
 I was not well cleaned 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.390
 well to see if this normal 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.880
 and thank goodness that there was a moon that 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.650
 illuminated the compass that had more or 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.600
 less for the constellations measured by 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.130
 the day the sun sets in the west and I 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:41.640
 I studied well I trained myself 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:43.020
 because I could not die had to come 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.600
 for here 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.550
 and was all the time the last 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.620
 days without eating without drinking water 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:53.430
 without eating it has given me a lot of water more or 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:56.790
 least I had almost all time oriented 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:59.940
 incredible judge for the good the good the 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.930
 judge in the morning I appear a 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.580
 candle in allusion t 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:06.060
 well I said good henry now now and now 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.770
 went out to look I do not understand and I looked and 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.480
 I knew my direction my orientation I 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.850
 I knew neither compass 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.710
 the tip of the table test and the 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:15.530
 northeast which is where it came from and I 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.760
 I checked with that candle that I saw saying 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:19.290
 give in to see what he's doing because 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.060
 I know what I 'm doing despite 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:23.240
 is delirious and all those things I know 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.530
 where do i go 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.120
 I followed a candle until it was gone 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.560
 until it disappeared in the afternoon 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.410
 where you get account has looked at don 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.060
 diego fell marquesa is to say when 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.520
 you came to fell Marquise you had no idea 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.440
 me as I approach by the 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.990
 tomorrow I start to appear I see the 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:41.520
 change the color of the sea ​​and start 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.900
 appear me boats boats and 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.760
 helicopters I think they're looking for me 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.590
 I hid in the table I was lying down 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:52.650
 for until it happened you knew that 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:54.000
 there the law could no longer be in bad 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.580
 a horse arrives but I know I gave myself 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.470
 mind that I was too much not me 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.360
 they were going to find there and to the right 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:02.759
 as I was entering and a change 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.400
 more like with sand and good at best 

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:07.320
 in nerves I write that I give it boiler 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:10.259
 I can do it there because in that 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.509
 I went in to comment on the team and it's 

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:14.880
 when it came that there was marquise once 

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:16.860
 that you get there that happens there I try to 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.750
 look for water was too much the output of 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.130
 many days I could hardly stand 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:22.380
 when one spends a lot of time in the sea 

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:24.419
 go to work to walk the earth 

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:26.340
 You must be caught as we are 

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:27.780
 disoriented completely disoriented 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:31.110
 at the time of walking but I already knew that 

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:33.720
 were those boats those helicopters or 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:36.750
 it does not pass in vats or that amount of 

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:38.190
 those here and started locating water already 

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:39.660
 I knew it was in habitable keys that 

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:41.850
 now the second part of the trip was coming 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:44.190
 that is to say how they discovered me in 

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:46.710
 that horse that there are no people and is 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:49.440
 as a god put me in front was 

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:51.810
 close some fishermen who came as 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.370
 He warmed up is there in front of me I 

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:55.370
 I shouted 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.370
 zero 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:58.169
 I had no strength to shout no 

00:06:57.539 --> 00:07:01.620
 I screamed at him 

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:02.969
 that they gave me water almost without you 

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:05.069
 lying on the sand he no longer had the 

00:07:02.969 --> 00:07:07.390
 forces and that told me they could not 

00:07:05.069 --> 00:07:09.760
 provide help here 

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:11.170
 and they're going to call the coast guards and 

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.740
 when it does if they are set for the shore and 

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:13.740
 see the table 

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:20.650
