00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
darker green I'm tying I think it was

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.170 
darker green I'm tying I think it was
pine<00:02:53.800> I<00:02:54.100> didn't<00:02:54.280> write<00:02:54.430> down<00:02:54.459> their<00:02:54.850> colors

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
pine I didn't write down their colors

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.800 
pine I didn't write down their colors
and<00:02:55.420> then<00:02:55.930> there's<00:02:56.500> another<00:02:56.650> turquoise<00:02:57.810> and

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
and then there's another turquoise and

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.009 
and then there's another turquoise and
I'm<00:02:58.989> just<00:02:59.200> putting<00:02:59.470> these<00:02:59.590> on<00:02:59.769> the<00:02:59.890> edges<00:03:00.280> and

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
I'm just putting these on the edges and

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.390 
I'm just putting these on the edges and
spraying<00:03:02.019> them<00:03:02.200> with<00:03:02.230> some<00:03:02.620> water<00:03:02.829> so<00:03:03.160> that<00:03:03.190> it

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
spraying them with some water so that it

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.060 
spraying them with some water so that it
runs<00:03:03.579> down<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:04.269> side<00:03:04.480> of<00:03:04.510> the<00:03:04.660> page<00:03:04.900> and<00:03:05.260> since

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
runs down the side of the page and since

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.810 
runs down the side of the page and since
there's<00:03:06.280> all<00:03:06.549> that<00:03:06.700> texture<00:03:07.090> and<00:03:07.799> the<00:03:08.820> little

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
there's all that texture and the little

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.340 
there's all that texture and the little
piece<00:03:10.000> of<00:03:10.030> paper<00:03:10.180> that<00:03:10.600> I<00:03:10.690> glued<00:03:10.900> on<00:03:11.049> there<00:03:11.260> it

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
piece of paper that I glued on there it

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.770 
piece of paper that I glued on there it
kind<00:03:11.560> of<00:03:11.620> gives<00:03:11.980> places<00:03:12.670> for<00:03:12.820> the<00:03:12.910> ink<00:03:13.090> to<00:03:13.360> run

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
kind of gives places for the ink to run

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.410 
kind of gives places for the ink to run
and<00:03:14.079> not<00:03:14.230> run<00:03:14.670> now<00:03:15.670> I'm<00:03:15.880> just<00:03:16.060> going<00:03:16.239> around

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
and not run now I'm just going around

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.460 
and not run now I'm just going around
the<00:03:16.570> edges<00:03:16.780> with<00:03:17.320> some<00:03:17.709> memento<00:03:18.489> black<00:03:19.470> ink

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
the edges with some memento black ink

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.280 
the edges with some memento black ink
from<00:03:21.160> a<00:03:21.310> stamp<00:03:21.549> pad<00:03:21.760> and<00:03:22.209> this<00:03:22.959> just<00:03:23.230> brings

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
from a stamp pad and this just brings

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.670 
from a stamp pad and this just brings
out<00:03:23.650> even<00:03:24.220> more<00:03:24.400> the<00:03:24.610> texture<00:03:25.030> from<00:03:25.420> the

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
out even more the texture from the

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:33.750 
out even more the texture from the
little<00:03:26.680> cards<00:03:27.100> that<00:03:27.310> I<00:03:27.430> glued<00:03:27.730> down

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.660 

now<00:03:34.750> I<00:03:34.780> know<00:03:35.140> this<00:03:35.620> needs<00:03:35.890> a<00:03:36.159> splash<00:03:36.430> of

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
now I know this needs a splash of

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.820 
now I know this needs a splash of
something<00:03:36.819> an<00:03:37.120> even<00:03:37.420> brighter<00:03:37.599> so<00:03:38.110> I<00:03:38.409> got<00:03:38.799> out

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
something an even brighter so I got out

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.539 
something an even brighter so I got out
my<00:03:39.250> Americana<00:03:39.970> neon<00:03:40.720> paint<00:03:41.650> and<00:03:41.980> I<00:03:42.099> mixed<00:03:42.430> it

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
my Americana neon paint and I mixed it

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:44.250 
my Americana neon paint and I mixed it
with<00:03:42.700> some<00:03:42.760> water<00:03:43.299> just<00:03:43.420> to<00:03:43.780> thin<00:03:43.810> it<00:03:44.080> out<00:03:44.200> a

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
with some water just to thin it out a

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.100 
with some water just to thin it out a
bit<00:03:44.349> and<00:03:44.879> brush<00:03:45.879> it<00:03:46.030> along<00:03:46.120> the<00:03:46.420> edges<00:03:46.780> and

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
bit and brush it along the edges and

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.500 
bit and brush it along the edges and
squirting<00:03:47.620> it<00:03:47.709> with<00:03:48.010> some<00:03:48.310> water<00:03:48.519> so<00:03:48.970> that<00:03:49.000> it

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
squirting it with some water so that it

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.430 
squirting it with some water so that it
can<00:03:49.720> run<00:03:49.959> and<00:03:51.540> then<00:03:52.540> just<00:03:52.900> making<00:03:53.080> sure<00:03:53.290> it's

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
can run and then just making sure it's

00:03:53.440 --> 00:04:12.170 
can run and then just making sure it's
good<00:03:53.650> and<00:03:53.680> dry<00:03:53.799> with<00:03:54.069> my<00:03:54.190> heat<00:03:54.370> gun

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.960

so now I am just splattering on some

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.479 
so now I am just splattering on some
white<00:04:15.180> craft<00:04:15.480> paint<00:04:15.870> that<00:04:16.229> has<00:04:16.500> been<00:04:16.949> Bend

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
paint I like to go around the edges

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.600 
paint I like to go around the edges
again<00:04:36.570> really<00:04:36.900> quick<00:04:37.170> with<00:04:37.560> my<00:04:37.860> black<00:04:38.250> ink<00:04:38.550> pad

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610
