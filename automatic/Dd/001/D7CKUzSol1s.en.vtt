00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.130
 bigger craft and tonight I'm going to do tv 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.530
 the ten commandments of the king of pop measure 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.210
 following 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:34.130
 first you have to dress with the 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:38.210
 best transshipment of the best sets 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:41.620
 which are yesterday 2 and 4 of 5 and 6 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.620
 Do you have to pay for old school? 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:47.640
 you see that it would mount a powerful mount and 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.560
 the traffic of lost time is a myth right 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.970
 the white duck of the lost time a dream 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.920
 of consumption by any person in 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.660
 any part of the world is a mount 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.280
 that calls attention to a mount that 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.850
 shows that you have no life outside of 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.850
 game 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.480
 so when the person and dps is one more in 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.309
 raid né 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.050
 now started yesterday and ends up staying in 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.000
 evidence because sextant an issue 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.630
 highlights is an issue that everyone 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.600
 would you like 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.670
 and to the repair bill you know she is not 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.550
 can range from 5,000 gold to 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.550
 infinite 50 60 and 70 thousand 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.160
 When are you going to write and stay in? 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.110
 city ​​center always has one person 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.190
 or one or two that ends up doing the stage 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.110
 sunset right 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:33.510
 This you no longer have as you do pvp 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.510
 Do not you have all that luxury and glamor? 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.030
 back raid with keels even because of the 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.400
 my physical integrity 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:41.990
 unfortunately the furniture ends up 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.330
 For stupid, my mother has a bit of 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.310
 Water and you and me, too. 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.320
 Watch out for my life and mine. 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:50.780
 children too 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.420
 I'll be very honest about the table 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.420
 I like to take more than cola 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.190
 but the table of wizards is understood until 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.410
 because there is a lot of preparation for 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.150
 confuse the miserable thing that happens for 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.770
 five around coming back then one thing 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:11.500
 that draws attention to the root of Sectec 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:14.720
 you know it has 67 blinking flashes 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.430
 lifting the bottle was dense 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.470
 another important thing is to have in your 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.150
 radio and people known people with 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.770
 fingers that know how to play 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.620
 that sure wins everything adds 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:27.220
 mount winery your raid adds climb 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.220
 add all 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.840
 the radio has to have women women 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.120
 with beautiful voices that needs to be in the 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.310
 It's also because it does not make sense to you. 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.480
 have all that there and could not hear 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.760
 their voices are not 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.959
 It's how you pay the monthly fee for gold 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.459
 and play tibia 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:46.820
 You know what, but I already think it's 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:48.260
 heavy talk I've already passed the item I 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.010
 wanted for a person who said it was 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.540
 woman 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:56.150
 he was using a staff that would change the 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:58.130
 voice on the radio ps I like 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.040
 attend are playing 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:04.450
 best are unique items that 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.450
 have earned titles 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:12.000
 Whoever does a radio has to take those s 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.040
 if you did not have 11 it's cool you 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.380
 have to have to disclose 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:22.470
 show to post on the forum in question 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:25.050
 envy whoever walks on the good mount 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.470
 by the good set is in an x-ray players 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:30.120
 good one all the hardest bosses 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.530
 So I really think this is over. 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.050
 being a little jealous 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:37.310
 I know that many will stay but anyway I 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.310
 I see it as envy
