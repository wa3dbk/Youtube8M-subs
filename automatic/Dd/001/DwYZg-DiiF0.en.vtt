00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:10.800
 hey people here and in that again there are 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.480
 again a very exciting topic 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.770
 As always there is a big fight 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:19.650
 playstation 4 vs xbox one or maybe 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.240
 not English gc xbox want 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.890
 not so good and the desire actually 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.570
 quite off against the ps4 in last 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.380
 time ever in the eyes of the 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.570
 community 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.699
 no matter if here in america here 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.800
 the psp it is a lot of borner and me 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.719
 think that's crazy because the xbox 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.820
 players get yes the dlcs earlier 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.739
 and yet the ps was the region around 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.140
 presented a lot more than the xbox 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.980
 for example, and that's it 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.750
 impressive 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.600
 but now there is a turn for you 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.719
 yes also says that the ps4 followed in pee 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.640
 will play and the xbox monsanto and 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.590
 the whole thing is played that is 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.510
 especially on big monitors it pulls 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.670
 then on the psp a lot better 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.620
 and generally you should be huge then 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.850
 see difference but there is 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.039
 somehow not because you can 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.260
 officially watch xbox from gameplay and 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.970
 Of course, ps4 gameplay is also around now 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.189
 the two were compared side by side 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.869
 and you can see that the whole thing is almost identical 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.479
 looks, if not really, completely 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.950
 very quite the same and that 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.659
 Of course, this is not the case of the ps4 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.549
 of course, if you're careful 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.320
 Of course he still sees the details 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.700
 always a bit better but the 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.570
 You can almost make a difference 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.680
 not seen 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.119
 and if we are not right now 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.189
 in a row are and for example 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.780
 a gameplay from a youtuber attracts 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.759
 now on the ps4 plays and after 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.740
 one of the one on the front xbox 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.659
 you will most likely play 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.070
 do not see any difference and that 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.140
 Of course I'm happy for the community 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.030
 but of course there is a down again 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.829
 time for now would be the whole again 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.049
 on a level working vips four 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.689
 somehow pulled down next to it 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.729
 knows how many times nfp plays there are huge 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.270
 framerate drops and not at all 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.159
 Rare 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.320
 it has now been reported that it 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.600
 on the ps4 really constant framerate 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.070
 drops and currently the xbox one 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.390
 caught up twice, so to speak 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.360
 There is nothing there 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.380
 like white on svento ntp 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.960
 parked play there is no 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.610
 problems and at the kulthandy on the 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.409
 ps4 actually pretty much the same 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.330
 looks like there are huge problems 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.340
 and especially with multiplayer matches 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.230
 where a lot happens at the same time and 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.750
 throw more grenades 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.180
 and normal grenades and killstreaks and 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.159
 Skill with her dogs &amp; riley 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.930
 There's just that big frame rate 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:22.920
 drops and who is not under it now 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.690
 can imagine 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.670
 Just imagine the pictures 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.220
 in seconds the frames per second 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.200
 It does not mean that is less 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.640
 more so fluid and the whole hangs 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.470
 kind of easy on of course only for 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.510
 a few seconds but especially in the 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.450
 As I said before, multiplayer is natural 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.590
 totally annoying that was all first 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.510
 information about me would 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.280
 Interested in what you say I'm up 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.660
 every case is very upset and will 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.879
 her know if you guys the little 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.620
 ps4 graphic advantage actually 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:51.150
 important is scary that in any case 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.129
 times down in the description on there have 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.599
 I packed some left and there 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:57.090
 you could already see how strong this one is 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:57.989
 graphical advantage over are ye 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.209
 maybe even a console 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.680
 presented and regrets it now or is 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.329
 They do not really care about golf 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.040
 that really all of you are down in 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:06.569
 know the comments and if I do that 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.799
 has fallen back then I really 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.140
 mean a lot if you mean my thumb 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.700
 Home gives and if he continues vigorously 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.290
 the videos wanted and of course 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.790
 also videos to the new consoles 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.319
 then subscribe in any case mine 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.730
 not to miss anything 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.930
 But first of all, that's me 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.829
 I wish you a nice day and 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.829
 say look
