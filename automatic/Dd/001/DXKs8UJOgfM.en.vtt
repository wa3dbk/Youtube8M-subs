00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.649 
don't really color in the bottom lip too
much<00:01:57.590> it<00:01:58.590> separates<00:01:59.130> them<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.520> helps<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.360> and

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
much it separates them and helps you and

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:01.910 
much it separates them and helps you and
especially<00:02:00.810> on<00:02:01.229> black<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.409> white<00:02:01.680> drawing

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
especially on black and white drawing

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.380 
especially on black and white drawing
really<00:02:02.130> see<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.520> difference<00:02:02.549> between<00:02:03.240> them

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
really see the difference between them

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.690 
really see the difference between them
and<00:02:03.509> then<00:02:04.500> what<00:02:04.740> we'll<00:02:04.829> do<00:02:05.009> I<00:02:05.040> guess<00:02:05.399> is<00:02:05.579> we'll

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
and then what we'll do I guess is we'll

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.240 
and then what we'll do I guess is we'll
just<00:02:05.850> kind<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.030> come<00:02:06.210> on<00:02:06.360> down<00:02:07.009> side<00:02:08.009> of<00:02:08.160> her

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
just kind of come on down side of her

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.530 
just kind of come on down side of her
face

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.060 

again<00:02:12.540> take<00:02:12.900> your<00:02:12.960> time<00:02:13.380> you<00:02:13.410> do<00:02:13.740> not<00:02:13.890> really

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
again take your time you do not really

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.680 
again take your time you do not really

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
dictate that a bit so i would say at

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.540 
dictate that a bit so i would say at
this<00:03:00.720> point<00:03:00.840> if<00:03:01.140> you<00:03:01.230> got<00:03:01.380> the<00:03:01.530> rough<00:03:01.710> outline

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
this point if you got the rough outline

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.020 
this point if you got the rough outline
for<00:03:02.790> her<00:03:02.880> phase<00:03:03.150> done<00:03:03.510> i<00:03:04.250> would<00:03:05.250> say<00:03:05.460> we'll

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
for her phase done i would say we'll

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.310 
for her phase done i would say we'll
move<00:03:06.180> on<00:03:06.330> down<00:03:06.510> to<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:06.690> next<00:03:06.840> clip<00:03:07.140> what<00:03:07.260> we

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
move on down to the next clip what we

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.860 
move on down to the next clip what we
learn<00:03:07.470> how<00:03:07.590> to<00:03:07.680> draw<00:03:07.860> her<00:03:08.010> hair<00:03:08.630> alright<00:03:09.630> so
