 Today 's in the background again 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.849
 a black ops trend that plays by me 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.929
 because the communities do not like that 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.940
 a lot of gas goes to the end of black ops 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.809
 vailati me so okay if you think you are 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.770

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.880
 have a look over but of course about 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.130
 this video ends here 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.500
 Looked 've already read in the title 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.469
 Today 's an episode three stories 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.410
 and I guess when we get there have 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:41.040
 we directly contact you 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:42.239
 ok today it's about I think that 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.280
 series I can explain it briefly 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.329
 already eight follow until now link is in 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.469
 the video description to the playlist 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.910
 I'll take a look at everyone though 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.960
 you stand on it as soon as you get the series 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.910
 I do not know yet and only now 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.739
 her subscriptions have always been subscribed 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.870
 Almost 32,000 now 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.129
 fuck is tÃ¡los age I imagine it that way 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.270
 So I have the little camera lens 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.710
 in front of me and then I look at it 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.629
 huge stadium behind that it's great 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.100
 my subscriber would be just that 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.359
 does not go in here that is not possible 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.930
 in and I think to be big 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.100
 sometimes that's how I get started 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.479
 hope the microphone is turned down 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.790
 because I made such a loud noise 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.020
 but is also no matter otherwise would be 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.189
 I does not get so mop up if 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.020
 not now is good 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:22.770
 works i am gay and was clear 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:23.759
 shit i love to give you the videos 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.250
 Could be such a bullshit here 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.840
 tell and so on but come now 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.250
 we go to the story as I said and indeed 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.270
 it's a football stadium today 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.700
 visit 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.900
 yes I try football stadium if you 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.920
 I want to know from which club I fan 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.479
 am with him on a mile 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.979
 drop by the positive but what 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.560
 from that 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:42.750
 so that the whole city here and me 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.009
 I like to go to the stadium so I have 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.299
 how a story that I experienced myself 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.409
 I can tell you about that 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.920
 game I even have a photo before 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.500
 posted on facebook and indeed 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.960
 yes I was in the stadium with the conscience 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.070
 club against hertha bsc so and it was 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.299
 normally I put my form 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.740
 gone beatings seen yourself 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:58.159
 more common ones that strike each other 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.899
 game 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.950
 and that's what it's about 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:02.149
 rackets in the autumn probably 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.759
 already read about in the title 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:05.899
 brawl stood there certainly because when 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.670
 I was after the train I have to 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:09.500
 necessarily still almost to 35 years old 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.989
 drunk fun the punch I tell 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.880
 one story about the first time only once has 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.100
 which is also heavily intoxicated 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.690
 are not the normal ones 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.610
 celebrate as normal cool many places 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.900
 and honestly somehow drinks it 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.220
 not so much as steel and so on 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.360
 but if I drink something , well, yes 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.620
 I do not wear it that way either 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.049
 Not in the schoolyard as you think 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.850
 happily more often gone every case this 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:30.620
 people who are too hasty too fiercely always like that 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.910
 drink and then hit each other 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.860
 The end must be that these people always 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.239
 so then become aggressive and get nothing 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.130
 especially if you like it 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.030
 ultras and hooligans and I can 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.130
 not at all, of course, there are also 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.060
 peaceful ultras patterns both sides 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.769
 but I hate that 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.810
 exaggerated if you're always so upset 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.160
 Violence is always so violent 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.480
 necessarily clear you can with it 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.769
 someone shit because of something 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.299
 yes alright i am i have too 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:51.170
 but if you take them with you 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:52.790
 beats and how to be sure 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.500
 wants to beat because the old age is 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.030
 or so then I just hindered that 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.829
 Honestly every case I stood then 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.660
 in the train so it was so tight in this 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:01.340
 school year still a few colleagues it was 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:03.560
 so close everything is really together 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.390
 is pressed really right that was 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.709
 really abnormal simply because we first 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.060
 once got the earliest train 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.930
 marathon lightweight to the station 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.959
 have slipped ne 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.209
 Japan already has some so we are in there 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:15.829
 and then my fans ran like that 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.730
 so I've got it but so has it 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:18.109
 me already a short that so loud 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:19.370
 the whole time were screaming yet 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:20.180
 sung this sing if you already 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:21.950
 times with merkel closed 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.600
 by rotated by a small alcohol 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:24.680
 stadium is, of course, singing whole 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.780
 I say chilled 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.370
 but if you drop then yes and you 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.120
 sing and when you're so drunk and 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.190
 should get in your ear too 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.450
 that has become so easy and simple 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.069
 That's why I just thought so 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.750
 shit marcel you know the same is the 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:39.950
 escalate mood correctly because mine 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.959
 have eyes so one sees such a 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.760
 hertha bsc fell as a coworker 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.200
 and that was you know the kind you 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.910
 the stupidity already in the face easy 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.410
 looks that is so sad if you have 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.510
 already seen how stupid is on everyone 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.650
 case the stand next to me and the 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.139
 have written directly first 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.579
 and so you are not and so on 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:57.319
 have to get out of this somewhere 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:58.770
 he calls back already as he has so 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:01.230
 look stupid you do not believe that 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.950
 Suddenly it was about the same 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.180
 situation 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.440
 I knew he still gets to the 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.580
 eat because he in the same case um 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.080
 got out like the fans of 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.370
 my club and not you 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.630
 cool from I thought coming so let 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.850
 because the guy does not do that anyway 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.140
 had excited at once 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.400
 I just look around then I have me 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.810
 I'll provoke that once 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.549
 little bit the village 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.020
 I wanted to look him in the eye like that 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.790
 right in the eye and he like that 

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:23.520
 futuristic dangerous way 35 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:26.220
 seconds his jacket from pulling his 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.840
 jacket and I thought so already 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.890
 shit I'm not bock meanwhile loose 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.540
 35 0 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.160
 I have absolutely no bock longer to 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.690
 35-year-old to beat he is coming 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.250
 the pretty already thinking like 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.050
 said I say right so i say 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.200
 really loud so december here is too little 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:42.030
 was space now no bock it 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.230
 i honestly want the e i want 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.270
 do not specify at all or sun 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.920
 he was just always 1 70 always full 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.780
 drunk probably would have me so im 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.520
 normal case of men constantly clapped 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.660
 but he was too drunk he had none 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.890
 I would have given my chance 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.960
 would have been in the floor as honest 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:57.600
 and I'm looking for you to leave because 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.950
 I do with any word in any case 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.060
 then I stared at him so on 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.590
 and then also had some channel 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.790
 and my station came back like that 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.560
 two minutes later he was already 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.920
 ready he was really ready 2 go say 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:06.510
 me once 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.890
 but luckily I know then to say 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.240
 that the fans of my club are 

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.950
 have still avenged for me for his 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.540
 stupid noticed the train in the whole 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.620
 Ganzzug takes off his jacket and comes 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:16.260
 on me too, that's it too 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.030
 colleague that something is everywhere 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:19.590
 women and so forth will beat here 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.760
 or what, well, in any case, right 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.050
 honestly I hate that 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.210
 change this aggressive mood 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.050
 after that she is only lost wisely 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.700
 have not lost anymore 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.260
 the compensation he came even so 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.370
 actually total nonsense 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.750
 nevertheless expresses a draw 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.420
 no reason to fight like that anyway 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.770
 in victory and defeat but no shit 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:36.420
 I'd rather drink one together 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.590
 Well, I guess I know how I do that 

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:39.360
 my that is just so disabled because 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:41.130
 To the state, this aggressive mood 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.870
 i can do a little beside story 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:46.020
 I was away in there 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:47.460
 wolfsburg is enough and there we have almost 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:48.990
 beaten with one of our fans 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.730
 just because he thinks he is like that 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.470
 got horny guy and I hate that 

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:53.910
 to write my comments as 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.870
 I have mine at the stadium too 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.150
 Of course , this is one or the other 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.440
 shouting a bit he goes but or 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:00.120
 the vocals and everything perfect that 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.200
 lovelier and not always 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.970
 I have to beat it totally 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.230
 is not handicapped on everyone 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:05.220
 case I almost puked everyday but 

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:06.300
 I was not so stubborn in that either 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.460
 I would already have a hit 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.110
 a little bit excited though 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.580
 I'm not that kind of guy anymore 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:14.069
 absolutely bock and so on me 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:15.419
 think that went well then 

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:16.710
 that then we are, so to speak, subservient 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:17.669
 Dirt can get off and the wixxer 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.520
 then hopefully still on the 

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:21.750
 of course you get a mouthful 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:23.280
 write a funny brawl or 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.630
 stadium story and in the comments 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.830
 not everything now by force 

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:27.240
 if I restore all the 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:28.380
 coolest we summarize in any case 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.020
 right, I think so 

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.979
 Of course I say I would be very happy 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.970
 I'm looking forward to 1200 reviews 

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:37.430
 say skin in 

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:37.430
 bye bye next time
