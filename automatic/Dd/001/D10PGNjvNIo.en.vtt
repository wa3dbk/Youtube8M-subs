like<00:01:23.159> maybe<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.640> pea-sized<00:01:24.540> now<00:01:24.840> I<00:01:24.869> really

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
like maybe a pea-sized now I really

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.859 
like maybe a pea-sized now I really
don't<00:01:25.650> know<00:01:29.090> okay<00:01:30.090> it's<00:01:30.420> probably<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.780> little

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
don't know okay it's probably a little

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.330 
don't know okay it's probably a little
much<00:01:31.049> yep<00:01:31.409> that's<00:01:31.680> definitely<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:32.040> little<00:01:32.130> much

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
much yep that's definitely a little much

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.399 
much yep that's definitely a little much
but<00:01:33.240> we'll<00:01:33.479> work<00:01:33.630> with<00:01:33.720> it<00:01:33.840> okay<00:01:34.049> it's<00:01:34.350> very

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
but we'll work with it okay it's very

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.109 
but we'll work with it okay it's very
thick<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.130> can<00:01:35.159> already<00:01:35.430> tell<00:01:35.640> that<00:01:35.820> already

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
thick it can already tell that already

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.429 
thick it can already tell that already
which<00:01:36.329> is<00:01:36.479> good<00:01:36.689> because<00:01:36.900> that<00:01:37.020> means<00:01:37.140> it's

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
which is good because that means it's

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:38.539 
which is good because that means it's
probably<00:01:37.560> going<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:37.920> give<00:01:38.040> us<00:01:38.159> some<00:01:38.340> full

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
probably going to give us some full

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.690 
probably going to give us some full
coverage<00:01:38.909> which<00:01:39.090> is<00:01:39.240> what<00:01:39.390> we<00:01:39.509> need<00:01:39.720> Oh

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
coverage which is what we need Oh

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.620 
coverage which is what we need Oh
perfect<00:01:41.700> okay<00:01:41.880> because<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.119> was<00:01:42.270> nervous<00:01:42.479> that

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
perfect okay because I was nervous that

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.819 
perfect okay because I was nervous that
it<00:01:42.810> wasn't<00:01:42.990> going<00:01:43.079> to<00:01:43.140> be<00:01:43.200> light<00:01:43.439> enough<00:01:43.470> but

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
it wasn't going to be light enough but

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.590 
it wasn't going to be light enough but
this<00:01:43.950> will<00:01:44.070> definitely<00:01:44.220> be<00:01:44.490> light<00:01:45.299> enough<00:01:45.450> you

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
this will definitely be light enough you

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.450 
this will definitely be light enough you

I'm<00:01:48.300> just<00:01:48.480> kind<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.690> applying<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.710> with<00:01:49.800> my

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
I'm just kind of applying it with my

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.550 
I'm just kind of applying it with my
fingers<00:01:50.280> in<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.670> triangle<00:01:51.390> I<00:01:51.600> love<00:01:52.020> my<00:01:52.140> eyes<00:01:52.290> I'm

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
fingers in a triangle I love my eyes I'm

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.870 
fingers in a triangle I love my eyes I'm
just<00:01:52.710> using<00:01:52.860> whatever<00:01:53.130> else<00:01:53.310> I<00:01:53.460> have<00:01:53.580> left

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
just using whatever else I have left

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.700 
just using whatever else I have left
down<00:01:54.330> my<00:01:54.540> nose<00:01:54.720> some<00:01:54.960> kind<00:01:55.140> of<00:01:55.170> areas<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:55.530> I

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
down my nose some kind of areas that I

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.680 
down my nose some kind of areas that I
would<00:01:55.920> highlight<00:01:56.280> normally<00:01:57.210> so<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.420> can

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
would highlight normally so I can

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:58.910 
would highlight normally so I can
definitely<00:01:57.810> tell<00:01:58.110> it's<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.350> very<00:01:58.560> thick

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
definitely tell it's a very thick

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.850 
definitely tell it's a very thick
consistency<00:01:59.880> already<00:02:00.380> which<00:02:01.380> doesn't<00:02:01.770> bother

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
consistency already which doesn't bother

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.400 
consistency already which doesn't bother
me<00:02:01.980> at<00:02:02.280> all<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.520> just<00:02:02.790> don't<00:02:03.210> want<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.660> to<00:02:03.750> crease

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:04.410 
me at all I just don't want it to crease

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.920 
me at all I just don't want it to crease
which<00:02:05.130> sometimes<00:02:05.490> thick<00:02:05.670> products<00:02:06.030> can<00:02:06.390> but<00:02:06.900> I

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
which sometimes thick products can but I

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.150 
which sometimes thick products can but I
definitely<00:02:07.440> need<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:07.590> thick<00:02:07.800> product

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
definitely need a thick product

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.859 
definitely need a thick product
underneath<00:02:08.369> my<00:02:08.550> eyes<00:02:08.700> because<00:02:08.970> if<00:02:09.510> it's<00:02:09.720> too

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
underneath my eyes because if it's too

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:10.969 
underneath my eyes because if it's too
liquidy<00:02:10.170> it's<00:02:10.320> just<00:02:10.440> not<00:02:10.560> going<00:02:10.680> to<00:02:10.770> give<00:02:10.860> me

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
liquidy it's just not going to give me

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.320 
liquidy it's just not going to give me
enough<00:02:11.190> coverage<00:02:11.550> so<00:02:11.850> I'm<00:02:11.970> going<00:02:12.120> to<00:02:12.180> go<00:02:12.240> ahead

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
enough coverage so I'm going to go ahead

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.120 
enough coverage so I'm going to go ahead
and<00:02:12.630> blend<00:02:12.990> this<00:02:13.140> out<00:02:13.440> with<00:02:13.620> my<00:02:13.740> Beauty

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
and blend this out with my Beauty

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.910 
and blend this out with my Beauty
Blender

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.009 

it<00:02:20.920> blends<00:02:21.280> out<00:02:21.430> really<00:02:21.489> really<00:02:22.120> nicely<00:02:22.569> it

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
it blends out really really nicely it

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:24.630 
it blends out really really nicely it
actually<00:02:23.500> is<00:02:23.739> much<00:02:24.129> easier<00:02:24.459> than<00:02:24.519> I<00:02:24.610> thought

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
actually is much easier than I thought

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:25.890 
actually is much easier than I thought
it<00:02:24.970> was<00:02:25.060> going<00:02:25.269> to<00:02:25.300> be<00:02:25.420> because<00:02:25.510> it<00:02:25.660> was<00:02:25.750> so

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
it was going to be because it was so

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.449 
it was going to be because it was so
thick<00:02:26.200> so<00:02:26.379> I<00:02:26.440> wasn't<00:02:26.590> sure<00:02:26.769> if<00:02:26.950> it<00:02:27.190> was<00:02:27.340> like

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
thick so I wasn't sure if it was like

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.070 
thick so I wasn't sure if it was like
going<00:02:27.700> to<00:02:27.790> blend<00:02:27.970> out<00:02:28.150> nicely<00:02:28.540> but<00:02:28.660> it<00:02:28.780> really

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
going to blend out nicely but it really

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.680 
going to blend out nicely but it really
really<00:02:29.470> does<00:02:29.709> I<00:02:30.129> just<00:02:30.760> used<00:02:30.940> way<00:02:31.390> too<00:02:31.450> much

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
really does I just used way too much

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.210 
really does I just used way too much
product<00:02:31.989> so<00:02:32.170> I'm<00:02:32.230> just<00:02:32.349> kind<00:02:32.560> of<00:02:32.620> using<00:02:33.099> my

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
product so I'm just kind of using my

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.559 
product so I'm just kind of using my
dampened<00:02:33.580> beauty<00:02:33.730> blender<00:02:33.970> to<00:02:34.060> pick<00:02:34.239> up<00:02:34.390> some

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
dampened beauty blender to pick up some

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:35.880 
dampened beauty blender to pick up some
of<00:02:34.660> that<00:02:34.690> excess<00:02:35.050> product<00:02:35.470> I<00:02:35.500> was<00:02:35.590> able<00:02:35.860> to

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
of that excess product I was able to

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.369 
of that excess product I was able to
take<00:02:36.430> them<00:02:36.610> off<00:02:36.700> and<00:02:36.910> blend<00:02:37.120> it<00:02:37.330> so<00:02:37.540> it<00:02:38.230> looks

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:38.379 
take them off and blend it so it looks

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:40.530 
take them off and blend it so it looks
fine<00:02:38.739> so<00:02:39.129> I'm<00:02:39.280> actually<00:02:39.489> really<00:02:40.450> really

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
fine so I'm actually really really

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.360 
fine so I'm actually really really
liking<00:02:40.989> it<00:02:41.080> I<00:02:41.200> find<00:02:41.440> to<00:02:41.590> be<00:02:41.709> very<00:02:42.069> full

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
liking it I find to be very full

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.339 
liking it I find to be very full
coverage<00:02:42.400> too<00:02:43.150> I'm<00:02:43.450> it's<00:02:43.599> really<00:02:43.660> covering<00:02:44.110> my

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
coverage too I'm it's really covering my

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
concealer that's way lighter than your

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.250 
concealer that's way lighter than your
skin<00:02:54.970> tone<00:02:55.120> this<00:02:55.420> is<00:02:55.540> just<00:02:55.660> what<00:02:55.780> I<00:02:55.810> personally

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
like I know it is not for everyone so

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:59.400 
like I know it is not for everyone so
you<00:02:58.060> know<00:02:58.299> they<00:02:58.420> have<00:02:58.540> a<00:02:58.569> broad<00:02:58.870> range<00:02:59.200> of

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:50.539 
because I was a little nervous when it

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:51.730

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.469 
was like really thick I thought maybe
you<00:04:51.919> could<00:04:51.949> settle<00:04:52.250> into<00:04:52.580> fine<00:04:52.610> lines<00:04:52.789> but

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:53.479 
you could settle into fine lines but

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:55.719 
you could settle into fine lines but
it's<00:04:53.960> not<00:04:54.199> at<00:04:54.440> all<00:04:54.680> I<00:04:54.919> did<00:04:55.099> set<00:04:55.400> it<00:04:55.520> like<00:04:55.610> I
