00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
easier to reach that level because you

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.430 
easier to reach that level because you
know<00:02:54.190> it's

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.490 
around it ended up probably being like
an<00:03:57.980> 8a<00:03:58.250> plus<00:03:58.520> pitch<00:03:58.790> so<00:03:59.120> still<00:03:59.990> ended<00:04:00.230> up<00:04:00.320> being

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
an 8a plus pitch so still ended up being

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.670 
an 8a plus pitch so still ended up being
a<00:04:00.590> really<00:04:00.860> awesome<00:04:01.100> hard<00:04:01.790> pitch<00:04:02.060> but<00:04:02.680> it

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
a really awesome hard pitch but it

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.440 
a really awesome hard pitch but it
wasn't<00:04:04.040> as<00:04:04.220> spectacular<00:04:04.490> as<00:04:04.970> I<00:04:05.180> was<00:04:05.300> hoping

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
wasn't as spectacular as I was hoping

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.370 
wasn't as spectacular as I was hoping
but<00:04:07.000> in<00:04:08.000> the<00:04:08.180> end<00:04:08.330> the<00:04:08.540> real<00:04:08.720> goal<00:04:08.990> was<00:04:09.230> to

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
but in the end the real goal was to

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.560 
but in the end the real goal was to
climb<00:04:09.620> this<00:04:09.830> amazing<00:04:10.520> cave<00:04:10.730> and<00:04:11.090> it<00:04:11.360> wasn't

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 
climb this amazing cave and it wasn't

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:14.800 
climb this amazing cave and it wasn't
necessarily<00:04:11.990> about<00:04:12.140> any<00:04:12.920> single<00:04:13.160> pitch<00:04:13.460> so<00:04:13.820> it

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
necessarily about any single pitch so it

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:17.650 
necessarily about any single pitch so it
was<00:04:14.960> really<00:04:15.260> like<00:04:15.410> a<00:04:16.660> groundbreaking

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
was really like a groundbreaking

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.979 
was really like a groundbreaking
achievement<00:04:18.110> for<00:04:18.230> myself<00:04:18.590> and<00:04:18.860> and<00:04:19.840> climb<00:04:20.840> out

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
achievement for myself and and climb out

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:22.960 
achievement for myself and and climb out
the<00:04:21.020> crazy<00:04:21.410> cave<00:04:21.739> was<00:04:21.950> it<00:04:22.250> was<00:04:22.640> really<00:04:22.880> an

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
the crazy cave was it was really an

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.220 
the crazy cave was it was really an
ambitious<00:04:23.360> goal<00:04:24.100> I<00:04:25.570> think<00:04:26.570> we're<00:04:26.870> just<00:04:26.900> lucky

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
ambitious goal I think we're just lucky

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:32.050 
ambitious goal I think we're just lucky
that<00:04:27.470> it<00:04:27.620> came<00:04:27.770> together<00:04:27.920> however<00:04:28.520> it<00:04:28.640> is<00:04:31.060> we

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
that it came together however it is we

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:33.780 
that it came together however it is we
could<00:04:32.180> say<00:04:32.390> it's<00:04:32.600> maybe<00:04:32.840> the<00:04:33.080> the<00:04:33.350> biggest

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
could say it's maybe the the biggest

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.840 
could say it's maybe the the biggest
worth<00:04:34.790> and<00:04:35.660> maybe<00:04:36.320> it's<00:04:36.590> a<00:04:36.710> world<00:04:37.130> record<00:04:37.310> but

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
worth and maybe it's a world record but

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:41.650 
worth and maybe it's a world record but
this<00:04:38.720> was<00:04:38.960> not<00:04:39.170> the<00:04:39.410> objective<00:04:39.800> for<00:04:40.760> us<00:04:40.820> and

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
this was not the objective for us and

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.190 
this was not the objective for us and
world<00:04:42.140> record<00:04:42.320> there<00:04:42.970> but<00:04:43.970> we<00:04:44.720> wanted<00:04:44.960> to<00:04:45.050> find

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
world record there but we wanted to find

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:54.800 
world record there but we wanted to find
this<00:04:45.410> unique<00:04:45.740> culture

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810
