in<00:00:09.809> our<00:00:09.870> galaxy<00:00:09.930> I<00:00:10.700> came<00:00:11.700> here<00:00:12.120> as<00:00:12.360> an<00:00:12.690> expert

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
in our galaxy I came here as an expert

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.200 
in our galaxy I came here as an expert
in<00:00:13.500> stellar<00:00:14.250> astronomy

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
in stellar astronomy

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.019 
in stellar astronomy
so<00:00:15.450> understanding<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.230> stars<00:00:16.619> themselves<00:00:17.029> so

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
so understanding the stars themselves so

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.420 
so understanding the stars themselves so
one<00:00:18.210> of<00:00:18.240> my<00:00:18.330> first<00:00:18.690> jobs<00:00:19.020> here<00:00:19.350> was<00:00:19.529> to<00:00:19.770> pick<00:00:20.100> of

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
one of my first jobs here was to pick of

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.040 
one of my first jobs here was to pick of
the<00:00:20.640> millions<00:00:21.029> of<00:00:21.150> stars<00:00:21.390> at<00:00:21.570> least<00:00:21.750> that<00:00:21.960> our

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
the millions of stars at least that our

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.220 
the millions of stars at least that our
telescope<00:00:22.529> is<00:00:22.680> going<00:00:22.890> to<00:00:23.010> see<00:00:23.189> which<00:00:23.910> are<00:00:24.060> the

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 
telescope is going to see which are the

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.570 
telescope is going to see which are the
150,000<00:00:25.230> that<00:00:25.590> were<00:00:25.710> actually<00:00:26.189> going<00:00:26.430> to

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
150,000 that were actually going to

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.960 
150,000 that were actually going to
observe<00:00:27.439> when<00:00:28.439> I<00:00:28.470> entered<00:00:28.920> college<00:00:29.310> I<00:00:29.340> was

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
observe when I entered college I was

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.939 
observe when I entered college I was
planning<00:00:30.300> on<00:00:30.390> being<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.630> business<00:00:30.990> major<00:00:31.199> so

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
planning on being a business major so

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.079 
planning on being a business major so
it's<00:00:32.160> very<00:00:32.309> far<00:00:32.699> from<00:00:32.940> science<00:00:33.479> and<00:00:34.729> yet<00:00:35.729> I<00:00:35.789> was

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:36.089 
it's very far from science and yet I was

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:38.059 
it's very far from science and yet I was
always<00:00:36.300> good<00:00:36.449> at<00:00:36.479> math<00:00:36.600> so<00:00:37.499> that<00:00:37.710> was<00:00:37.829> kind<00:00:38.039> of

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:38.069 
always good at math so that was kind of

00:00:38.069 --> 00:00:41.029 
always good at math so that was kind of
in<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.219> back<00:00:38.460> of<00:00:38.639> my<00:00:38.789> mind<00:00:38.999> and<00:00:39.589> one<00:00:40.589> day<00:00:40.859> in

00:00:41.029 --> 00:00:41.039 
in the back of my mind and one day in

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:42.680 
in the back of my mind and one day in
college<00:00:41.249> I<00:00:41.549> kind<00:00:41.789> of<00:00:41.850> asked<00:00:42.149> myself<00:00:42.299> out<00:00:42.659> of

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
college I kind of asked myself out of

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.879 
college I kind of asked myself out of
the<00:00:42.809> blue<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.109> question<00:00:43.469> you<00:00:43.589> know<00:00:43.710> if<00:00:43.799> you

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:43.889 
the blue the question you know if you

00:00:43.889 --> 00:00:47.239 
the blue the question you know if you
could<00:00:44.069> do<00:00:44.159> anything<00:00:45.089> what<00:00:45.629> would<00:00:45.749> it<00:00:45.809> be<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.799> I

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:47.249 
could do anything what would it be and I

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:49.279 
could do anything what would it be and I
decided<00:00:47.670> at<00:00:47.909> that<00:00:47.999> moment<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.690> would<00:00:48.899> work<00:00:49.079> for

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
decided at that moment I would work for

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:49.729 
decided at that moment I would work for
NASA

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
NASA

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.549 
NASA
the<00:00:50.039> space<00:00:50.280> program<00:00:50.789> I<00:00:51.030> just<00:00:51.959> enrolled<00:00:52.170> in<00:00:52.499> a

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
the space program I just enrolled in a

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.979 
the space program I just enrolled in a
physics<00:00:52.920> class<00:00:53.359> applied<00:00:54.359> for<00:00:54.569> an<00:00:54.629> internship

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
physics class applied for an internship

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.139 
physics class applied for an internship
that<00:00:55.409> was<00:00:55.559> key<00:00:55.889> to<00:00:56.399> my<00:00:56.579> professional

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
that was key to my professional

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.579 
that was key to my professional
development<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.959> everything<00:00:58.350> else<00:00:58.499> just

00:00:58.579 --> 00:00:58.589 
development and everything else just

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:00.500 
development and everything else just
kind<00:00:58.769> of<00:00:58.949> fell<00:00:59.190> into<00:00:59.339> place<00:00:59.579> you<00:01:00.119> know<00:01:00.329> when

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
kind of fell into place you know when

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.859 
kind of fell into place you know when
it's<00:01:00.659> right<00:01:01.789> when<00:01:02.789> we're<00:01:02.940> young<00:01:03.209> we<00:01:03.269> don't

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:03.869 
it's right when we're young we don't

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:05.420 
it's right when we're young we don't
really<00:01:04.049> know<00:01:04.439> what<00:01:04.769> all<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.009> possibilities

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
really know what all the possibilities

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.209 
really know what all the possibilities
are<00:01:05.869> so<00:01:06.869> when<00:01:07.350> you're<00:01:07.530> young<00:01:07.829> and<00:01:08.100> you're

00:01:08.209 --> 00:01:08.219 
are so when you're young and you're

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:10.190 
are so when you're young and you're
growing<00:01:08.490> I<00:01:08.820> think<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:09.329> just<00:01:09.539> want<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.869> be<00:01:10.020> sure

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
growing I think you just want to be sure

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.469 
growing I think you just want to be sure
you're<00:01:10.380> trying<00:01:10.740> new<00:01:10.979> things<00:01:11.149> and<00:01:12.149> you<00:01:12.240> want<00:01:12.390> to

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
you're trying new things and you want to

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.120 
you're trying new things and you want to
pay<00:01:12.600> attention<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.289> things<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:13.590> inspire

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
pay attention to the things that inspire

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.300 
pay attention to the things that inspire
you<00:01:15.020> pay<00:01:16.020> attention<00:01:16.469> to<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.039> follow

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
you pay attention to that and follow

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.580 
you pay attention to that and follow
that<00:01:17.579> path<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.240> ask<00:01:18.659> yourself<00:01:19.079> the<00:01:19.200> question

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
that path and ask yourself the question

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.899 
that path and ask yourself the question
you<00:01:19.649> know<00:01:19.799> if<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:19.979> could<00:01:20.159> do<00:01:20.280> anything<00:01:20.670> what

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
you know if you could do anything what

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.209 
you know if you could do anything what
would<00:01:21.060> it<00:01:21.119> be<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.659> that's<00:01:22.259> really<00:01:22.979> actually

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:23.219 
would it be and that's really actually

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:25.069 
would it be and that's really actually
easy<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.880> figure<00:01:24.060> out<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.570> answers<00:01:24.899> are<00:01:24.960> going

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:25.079 
easy to figure out the answers are going

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:27.139 
easy to figure out the answers are going
to<00:01:25.140> come<00:01:25.289> to<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:25.500> immediately<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:26.219> when<00:01:27.030> it

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:27.149 
to come to you immediately and when it

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:28.669 
to come to you immediately and when it
does<00:01:27.329> you<00:01:27.630> take<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.869> baby<00:01:28.170> step<00:01:28.259> in<00:01:28.649> that

00:01:28.669 --> 00:01:28.679 
does you take a baby step in that

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:31.940 
does you take a baby step in that
direction<00:01:29.039> and<00:01:30.140> don't<00:01:31.140> focus<00:01:31.350> so<00:01:31.619> much<00:01:31.679> on<00:01:31.890> the

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
direction and don't focus so much on the

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.580 
direction and don't focus so much on the
goal<00:01:32.310> itself<00:01:32.820> just<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.359> enjoy<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.810> ride<00:01:34.020> you

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
goal itself just to enjoy the ride you

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.739 
goal itself just to enjoy the ride you
know<00:01:34.710> just<00:01:35.009> take<00:01:35.249> the<00:01:35.399> journey<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.939> see<00:01:36.539> where

00:01:36.739 --> 00:01:36.749 
know just take the journey and see where

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:40.249 
know just take the journey and see where
it<00:01:36.840> leads<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.259> I<00:01:38.329> could<00:01:39.329> not<00:01:39.539> have<00:01:39.749> chosen<00:01:39.960> a

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
it leads you I could not have chosen a

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.919 
it leads you I could not have chosen a
career<00:01:40.649> that<00:01:40.829> didn't<00:01:41.130> have<00:01:41.280> meaning<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.539> me

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:42.929 
career that didn't have meaning to me

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:46.700 
career that didn't have meaning to me
and<00:01:43.789> the<00:01:44.789> Kepler<00:01:45.270> mission<00:01:45.539> is<00:01:45.990> just<00:01:46.319> about<00:01:46.530> as

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
and the Kepler mission is just about as

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.739 
and the Kepler mission is just about as
meaningful<00:01:47.280> as<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:47.579> gets<00:01:47.789> and<00:01:48.119> we're<00:01:48.420> looking

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:48.749

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:50.660 
meaningful as it gets and we're looking
for<00:01:48.929> new<00:01:49.079> worlds<00:01:49.319> in<00:01:49.590> our<00:01:49.679> galaxy<00:01:49.920> places<00:01:50.549> that

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
for new worlds in our galaxy places that

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.940 
for new worlds in our galaxy places that
are<00:01:50.789> potentially<00:01:51.329> habitable<00:01:51.530> more<00:01:52.530> than<00:01:52.740> that

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
are potentially habitable more than that

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.099 
are potentially habitable more than that
where<00:01:53.310> we're<00:01:53.609> trying<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.539> figure<00:01:54.630> out<00:01:54.869> if

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:55.109 
where we're trying to figure out if

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:56.870 
where we're trying to figure out if
earth-like<00:01:55.469> planets<00:01:55.890> are<00:01:56.009> even<00:01:56.280> common<00:01:56.759> in

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
earth-like planets are even common in

earth-like planets are even common in
our<00:01:56.999> galaxy<00:01:57.479> so<00:01:57.509> that<00:01:57.780> when<00:01:57.899> we<00:01:58.079> look<00:01:58.109> up<00:01:58.380> in

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
our galaxy so that when we look up in

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.950 
our galaxy so that when we look up in
the<00:01:58.619> sky<00:01:58.740> we<00:01:59.100> can<00:01:59.310> say<00:01:59.579> you<00:02:00.509> know<00:02:00.630> that<00:02:00.810> we're

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
the sky we can say you know that we're

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.770 
the sky we can say you know that we're
not<00:02:00.990> alone<00:02:01.469> that's<00:02:02.399> extremely<00:02:02.880> profound<00:02:03.389> and

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
not alone that's extremely profound and

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.649 
not alone that's extremely profound and
that's<00:02:03.929> what<00:02:04.109> drew<00:02:04.259> me<00:02:04.439> here
