00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.470
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:21.710
 another video on mpeg tester today with 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.869
 the tech blog at 3d construction stops he had 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.880
 a few days ago for free in the game 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.560
 app store appeared and it would like me 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:33.500
 imagine closer now 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:35.629
 have fun while playing alongside 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.450
 have just come in here 

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:41.020
 a world that stands it the same and 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.789
 you already see the first opponent 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:47.090
 load now up there you can load after 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:49.880
 the left forces from the screen always 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.670
 Chamber just run the right side 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.300
 only use it to aim at it 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.770
 then also the shooting lanes and the 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.500
 We can also say words up there 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:03.110
 the waxes change the weapon with it 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.320
 nevertheless have a handle and sometimes 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:09.829
 troops then the enemy weapons - 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.590
 the opponents form such blocks the 

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:15.229
 Then we can collect one too 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.610
 left then how much more and have 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.670
 We can do that later 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:22.429
 our weapons and ourselves too 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:26.840
 upgrade that the weapon according to faster 

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:29.389
 load or something or just that the opponents 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.229
 More blocks of troops taken care of luck 

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:36.079
 In addition, also buy in app purchases 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.789
 I show then have the same 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:39.819
 now, for example, another one 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:42.109
 weapon behind hand 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:44.029
 Here you can see that too 

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:45.709
 great menu with go to times now 

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:48.139
 attitude as you can then but just 

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:51.319
 meet different settings full 

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:54.590
 so here we can also upgrade 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:56.179
 go menu or buy new blocks 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.479
 I am so out 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:01.909
 Do you see the different prices then 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.799
 even silver cubes with the can 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.409
 then revive us just when we 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:09.470
 die down there now have even 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:12.140
 a blog doubles that means if mine 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.270
 block lonesome city with two worth us 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.610
 then come in the level up of the 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.550
 You can then weapons here 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.450
 deselected draws or even the armor 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.450
 and so on 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.580
 so now to my Conclusion to which we play 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.610
 I can see the game very nice 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.330
 has built a very nice graphics 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.310
 I think 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.860
 static then just just that it just 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:41.310
 always the same world is and there is 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.830
 only different opponents 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:48.510
 it can also be that always suddenly 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:50.940
 by spawn or just behind you 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.069
 a few times and of course the game 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.140
 free of charge annoying then of course the 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:58.440
 in-app purchases, it was better 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:02.430
 have always been the game for 89 cents 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:05.730
 or 269 or so, and none for that 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:08.010
 annoying in-app purchases has therefore found 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.799
 I had to play and entertaining fun 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.140
 that he is always the same world 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:15.360
 and the game has no reason 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.360
 also no further 10 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:21.030
 except that you have to try so long 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.620
 as possible to survive and the whole 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.319
 Blocks 1 together 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.860
 yes that 's it then from the video to the 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.860
 next time
