00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.780 
better when you're when you're working
with<00:02:31.640> it<00:02:31.819> it<00:02:32.540> cooks<00:02:32.780> up<00:02:32.989> better<00:02:33.260> it<00:02:33.790> dissolves

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
with it it cooks up better it dissolves

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.699 
with it it cooks up better it dissolves
better<00:02:35.030> when<00:02:35.299> it's<00:02:35.450> a<00:02:35.540> finer<00:02:35.930> so<00:02:36.319> that's<00:02:36.530> what

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
better when it's a finer so that's what

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.470 
better when it's a finer so that's what
I've<00:02:36.829> done<00:02:36.860> and<00:02:37.610> then<00:02:37.760> I<00:02:37.849> put<00:02:38.000> it<00:02:38.090> back<00:02:38.180> in<00:02:38.239> the

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
trying to lose weight you need to be a

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.529 
trying to lose weight you need to be a
little<00:04:21.680> more<00:04:21.799> careful<00:04:22.039> you<00:04:23.000> can<00:04:23.210> make<00:04:23.389> it

stove and we're gonna cook it up so I've

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:33.999 
stove and we're gonna cook it up so I've
got<00:04:32.509> it<00:04:32.630> on<00:04:32.720> high<00:04:32.990> heat<00:04:33.020> just<00:04:33.590> to<00:04:33.740> get<00:04:33.919> it

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:34.009 
got it on high heat just to get it

got it on high heat just to get it
started<00:04:34.550> and<00:04:34.759> I'll<00:04:35.630> just<00:04:35.990> stir<00:04:36.530> it<00:04:36.560> up<00:04:36.800> turn<00:04:37.580> it

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.250 
so this is 50 minutes cooking on the
stove<00:04:49.170> and<00:04:49.560> it's<00:04:50.300> lost<00:04:51.300> most<00:04:51.570> of<00:04:51.810> its<00:04:51.930> liquid

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
stove and it's lost most of its liquid

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.840 
stove and it's lost most of its liquid
