for<00:00:04.940> the<00:00:05.000> past<00:00:05.150> few<00:00:05.390> years<00:00:05.660> we've<00:00:06.020> recognized

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:06.560 
for the past few years we've recognized

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:07.960 
for the past few years we've recognized
it's<00:00:06.770> very<00:00:07.010> difficult<00:00:07.399> to<00:00:07.580> just<00:00:07.760> take<00:00:07.940> a

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:07.970 
it's very difficult to just take a

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:09.759 
it's very difficult to just take a
camera<00:00:08.300> and<00:00:08.450> take<00:00:08.630> a<00:00:08.690> picture<00:00:08.720> of<00:00:09.080> a<00:00:09.170> scene<00:00:09.410> and

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:09.769 
camera and take a picture of a scene and

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:12.009 
camera and take a picture of a scene and
then<00:00:09.890> look<00:00:10.130> at<00:00:10.280> it<00:00:10.400> and<00:00:10.610> really<00:00:11.059> capture<00:00:11.990> what

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:12.019 
then look at it and really capture what

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.820 
then look at it and really capture what
you<00:00:12.259> had<00:00:12.379> seen<00:00:12.620> so<00:00:13.719> instead<00:00:14.799> with<00:00:15.799> the

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:15.830 
you had seen so instead with the

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.920 
you had seen so instead with the
ubiquity<00:00:16.400> of<00:00:16.430> video<00:00:16.760> cameras<00:00:17.330> and<00:00:17.570> cameras

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:17.930 
ubiquity of video cameras and cameras

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.410 
ubiquity of video cameras and cameras
everywhere<00:00:18.220> we<00:00:19.220> realized<00:00:19.580> they<00:00:19.789> taking<00:00:20.120> lots

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.420 
everywhere we realized they taking lots

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.870 
everywhere we realized they taking lots
of<00:00:20.630> pictures<00:00:20.840> maybe<00:00:21.530> a<00:00:21.650> video<00:00:21.860> sequence<00:00:22.250> maybe

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 
of pictures maybe a video sequence maybe

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.670 
of pictures maybe a video sequence maybe
a<00:00:23.180> lot<00:00:23.570> of<00:00:23.660> pictures<00:00:23.930> taken<00:00:24.260> with<00:00:24.290> a<00:00:24.380> still

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:24.680 
a lot of pictures taken with a still

a lot of pictures taken with a still

either on a machine or up in the cloud

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:35.470 
either on a machine or up in the cloud
we<00:00:30.110> can<00:00:30.140> enhance<00:00:30.380> the<00:00:30.710> experience

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.210 

all<00:00:35.750> right<00:00:35.840> so<00:00:36.170> I<00:00:36.200> want<00:00:36.590> to<00:00:36.620> show<00:00:36.770> you<00:00:36.980> in

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.220 
all right so I want to show you in

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.670 
all right so I want to show you in
particular<00:00:37.670> how<00:00:37.820> we<00:00:37.880> created<00:00:38.300> this<00:00:38.510> image<00:00:38.870> if

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
particular how we created this image if

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.680 
particular how we created this image if
you've<00:00:39.860> lived<00:00:40.070> in<00:00:40.220> Seattle<00:00:40.430> for<00:00:41.300> any<00:00:41.390> part<00:00:41.630> of

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
you've lived in Seattle for any part of

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.090 
you've lived in Seattle for any part of
your<00:00:41.809> life<00:00:42.020> you've<00:00:42.290> certainly<00:00:42.530> seen<00:00:42.710> Mount

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
your life you've certainly seen Mount

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.470 
your life you've certainly seen Mount
Rainier

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
Rainier

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.569 
Rainier
and<00:00:44.690> the<00:00:45.620> first<00:00:45.829> thing<00:00:45.949> you<00:00:46.040> might<00:00:46.160> be<00:00:46.309> asking

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
and the first thing you might be asking

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.250 
and the first thing you might be asking
yourself<00:00:46.879> is<00:00:47.000> where<00:00:47.300> did<00:00:47.690> this<00:00:47.840> picture<00:00:48.020> of

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:48.260 
yourself is where did this picture of

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.960 
yourself is where did this picture of
Mount<00:00:48.470> Rainier<00:00:48.770> where<00:00:49.280> was<00:00:49.430> this<00:00:49.520> picture<00:00:49.790> of

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:49.970 
Mount Rainier where was this picture of

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.850 
Mount Rainier where was this picture of
Mount<00:00:50.059> Rainier<00:00:50.390> taken<00:00:50.750> from<00:00:50.930> and<00:00:51.589> I'll<00:00:51.710> try<00:00:51.830> to

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
Mount Rainier taken from and I'll try to

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.509 
Mount Rainier taken from and I'll try to
explain<00:00:51.980> that<00:00:52.430> so<00:00:53.030> if<00:00:53.120> you<00:00:53.239> look<00:00:53.390> over<00:00:53.600> here

00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:54.519 
explain that so if you look over here

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:57.220 
explain that so if you look over here
what<00:00:55.519> I'm<00:00:55.610> going<00:00:55.640> to<00:00:55.790> show<00:00:55.940> you<00:00:55.970> is<00:00:56.390> not<00:00:57.019> just

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
what I'm going to show you is not just

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.369 
what I'm going to show you is not just
one<00:00:57.500> input<00:00:58.070> image<00:00:58.430> but<00:00:59.089> many<00:00:59.449> input<00:00:59.809> images<00:01:00.110> I

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
one input image but many input images I

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:02.619 
one input image but many input images I
set<00:01:00.769> up<00:01:00.860> a<00:01:00.949> camera<00:01:01.220> in<00:01:01.400> downtown<00:01:01.910> Seattle

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
set up a camera in downtown Seattle

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.359 
set up a camera in downtown Seattle
and<00:01:02.720> this<00:01:03.320> is<00:01:03.440> what<00:01:03.589> I<00:01:03.620> saw<00:01:03.949> through<00:01:04.220> that

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
and this is what I saw through that

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.640 
and this is what I saw through that
camera<00:01:04.640> you'll<00:01:05.570> notice<00:01:05.900> because<00:01:06.110> the<00:01:06.290> lens

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
camera you'll notice because the lens

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.770 
camera you'll notice because the lens
was<00:01:06.800> so<00:01:07.009> long<00:01:07.280> that<00:01:07.970> the<00:01:08.090> mountain<00:01:08.360> appears<00:01:08.660> to

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
was so long that the mountain appears to

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.510 
was so long that the mountain appears to
be<00:01:08.869> shaking<00:01:09.229> around<00:01:09.560> and<00:01:09.920> that's<00:01:10.130> because

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:10.520 
be shaking around and that's because

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.430 
be shaking around and that's because
when<00:01:11.240> you<00:01:11.300> have<00:01:11.420> a<00:01:11.450> very<00:01:11.720> long<00:01:11.930> lens<00:01:12.200> it's

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
when you have a very long lens it's

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.930 
when you have a very long lens it's
almost<00:01:12.619> impossible<00:01:13.009> for<00:01:13.310> the<00:01:13.520> camera<00:01:13.820> to

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
almost impossible for the camera to

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.150 
almost impossible for the camera to
stand<00:01:14.180> still<00:01:14.450> in<00:01:15.020> addition<00:01:15.530> the<00:01:15.680> atmosphere

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
stand still in addition the atmosphere

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.730 
stand still in addition the atmosphere
of<00:01:16.280> course<00:01:16.550> makes<00:01:17.149> things<00:01:17.420> shake<00:01:17.509> and<00:01:18.289> here<00:01:18.560> we

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
of course makes things shake and here we

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.680 
of course makes things shake and here we
took<00:01:18.920> all<00:01:19.100> those<00:01:19.250> images<00:01:19.700> and<00:01:19.940> use<00:01:20.509> the

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
took all those images and use the

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.510 
took all those images and use the
computer<00:01:21.110> to<00:01:21.140> align<00:01:21.649> them<00:01:21.950> so<00:01:22.220> that<00:01:22.399> it

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
computer to align them so that it

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.130 
computer to align them so that it
doesn't<00:01:22.850> shake<00:01:23.000> so<00:01:23.240> much<00:01:23.450> but<00:01:23.690> you<00:01:23.780> can<00:01:23.810> still

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:24.140 
doesn't shake so much but you can still

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.660 
doesn't shake so much but you can still
if<00:01:24.500> you<00:01:24.619> look<00:01:24.800> carefully<00:01:24.979> you'll<00:01:25.399> see<00:01:25.430> the

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
if you look carefully you'll see the

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.029 
if you look carefully you'll see the
atmosphere<00:01:25.820> is<00:01:26.390> shifting<00:01:27.200> around<00:01:27.470> and<00:01:27.890> all

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:28.039 
atmosphere is shifting around and all

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:30.100 
atmosphere is shifting around and all
the<00:01:28.220> pixels<00:01:28.580> are<00:01:28.640> changing<00:01:28.940> finally<00:01:29.929> we<00:01:30.050> can

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
the pixels are changing finally we can

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.350 
the pixels are changing finally we can
go<00:01:30.229> in<00:01:30.350> and<00:01:30.770> we<00:01:30.860> can<00:01:31.009> move<00:01:31.160> every<00:01:31.580> individual

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
go in and we can move every individual

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.810 
go in and we can move every individual
pixel<00:01:32.780> by<00:01:32.899> itself<00:01:33.350> to<00:01:33.860> get<00:01:33.979> them<00:01:34.190> all<00:01:34.340> nice<00:01:34.610> and

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
pixel by itself to get them all nice and

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.260 
pixel by itself to get them all nice and
aligned<00:01:35.090> and<00:01:35.660> now<00:01:35.869> we<00:01:35.929> finally<00:01:36.350> have<00:01:36.500> a<00:01:36.649> nice

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
aligned and now we finally have a nice

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.779 
aligned and now we finally have a nice
stable<00:01:38.320> image<00:01:39.320> of<00:01:39.500> Mount<00:01:39.679> Rainier<00:01:40.039> but<00:01:40.700> it

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:40.789 
stable image of Mount Rainier but it

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:42.460 
stable image of Mount Rainier but it
doesn't<00:01:41.060> look<00:01:41.209> as<00:01:41.360> clear<00:01:41.599> as<00:01:41.690> we'd<00:01:41.869> like<00:01:42.050> so<00:01:42.349> we

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
doesn't look as clear as we'd like so we

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.589 
doesn't look as clear as we'd like so we
can<00:01:42.619> do<00:01:42.770> some<00:01:43.009> magic<00:01:43.429> which<00:01:43.640> we<00:01:43.789> call<00:01:43.970> d<00:01:44.149> hazing

00:01:44.589 --> 00:01:44.599 
can do some magic which we call d hazing

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:46.440 
can do some magic which we call d hazing
and<00:01:44.899> we<00:01:44.959> get<00:01:45.110> a<00:01:45.140> result<00:01:45.319> that<00:01:45.560> looks<00:01:45.830> like<00:01:45.950> this

hazing<00:01:49.190> you'll<00:01:49.550> see<00:01:49.759> a<00:01:49.789> lot<00:01:50.060> of<00:01:50.090> different

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
hazing you'll see a lot of different

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.180 
hazing you'll see a lot of different
artifacts<00:01:50.989> in<00:01:51.140> here<00:01:51.170> you<00:01:51.380> can<00:01:51.500> see<00:01:51.530> dust<00:01:51.860> spots

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
artifacts in here you can see dust spots

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.130 
artifacts in here you can see dust spots
from<00:01:52.459> dust<00:01:52.700> on<00:01:52.849> the<00:01:52.940> lens<00:01:52.970> and<00:01:53.479> if<00:01:53.780> you<00:01:53.899> look<00:01:54.050> at

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:54.140 
from dust on the lens and if you look at

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.139 
from dust on the lens and if you look at
the<00:01:54.229> mountain<00:01:54.709> it<00:01:55.190> doesn't<00:01:55.520> look<00:01:55.640> very<00:01:55.670> sharp

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
the mountain it doesn't look very sharp

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:58.479 
the mountain it doesn't look very sharp
in<00:01:56.390> all<00:01:56.509> the<00:01:56.630> places<00:01:56.810> because<00:01:57.380> of<00:01:57.410> what<00:01:58.399> we

00:01:58.479 --> 00:01:58.489 
in all the places because of what we

00:01:58.489 --> 00:02:00.940 
in all the places because of what we
need<00:01:58.670> to<00:01:58.819> do<00:01:58.940> to<00:01:59.090> expand<00:01:59.509> the<00:01:59.690> contrast<00:02:00.259> we<00:02:00.920> can

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
need to do to expand the contrast we can

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.180 
need to do to expand the contrast we can
take<00:02:01.340> all<00:02:01.670> those<00:02:01.970> images<00:02:02.479> and<00:02:02.750> align<00:02:03.649> them<00:02:03.950> as

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
take all those images and align them as

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:05.380 
take all those images and align them as
we<00:02:04.520> saw<00:02:04.880> before

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
we saw before

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.020 
we saw before
once<00:02:06.020> they're<00:02:06.229> aligned<00:02:06.640> somewhere<00:02:07.640> hidden<00:02:07.849> in

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
once they're aligned somewhere hidden in

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.639 
once they're aligned somewhere hidden in
there<00:02:08.149> is<00:02:08.270> a<00:02:08.300> much<00:02:08.569> sharper<00:02:08.810> image<00:02:09.289> and<00:02:09.440> a<00:02:09.470> much

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
there is a much sharper image and a much

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.949 
there is a much sharper image and a much
richer<00:02:09.890> engine<00:02:10.369> and<00:02:10.729> now<00:02:10.940> if<00:02:11.180> we<00:02:11.239> D<00:02:11.480> haze<00:02:11.690> that

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
richer engine and now if we D haze that

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.400 
richer engine and now if we D haze that
result<00:02:12.410> we<00:02:12.950> get<00:02:13.130> this<00:02:13.450> for<00:02:14.450> example<00:02:14.780> if<00:02:15.260> you

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
result we get this for example if you

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.080 
result we get this for example if you
see<00:02:15.560> the<00:02:15.709> sky<00:02:15.950> most<00:02:16.310> of<00:02:16.459> the<00:02:16.550> dust<00:02:16.730> has<00:02:16.940> been

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
see the sky most of the dust has been

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.790 
see the sky most of the dust has been
removed<00:02:17.360> and<00:02:17.660> if<00:02:18.080> you<00:02:18.170> look<00:02:18.319> at<00:02:18.410> the<00:02:18.500> mountain

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800 
removed and if you look at the mountain

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.949 
removed and if you look at the mountain
it's<00:02:18.890> much<00:02:19.129> sharper<00:02:19.430> and<00:02:20.060> that's<00:02:20.239> the<00:02:20.390> reason

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
it's much sharper and that's the reason

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:22.210 
it's much sharper and that's the reason
is<00:02:21.080> because<00:02:21.379> if<00:02:21.500> we<00:02:21.530> look<00:02:21.739> at<00:02:21.860> every<00:02:22.190> single

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
is because if we look at every single

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.580 
is because if we look at every single
pixel<00:02:22.730> here<00:02:23.180> what<00:02:23.690> we<00:02:23.810> did<00:02:23.989> is<00:02:24.140> we<00:02:24.170> relied<00:02:24.560> on

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
pixel here what we did is we relied on

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.130 
pixel here what we did is we relied on
something<00:02:25.129> we<00:02:25.280> called<00:02:25.520> lucky<00:02:26.209> imaging<00:02:26.660> it's

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
something we called lucky imaging it's

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.080 
something we called lucky imaging it's
something<00:02:27.530> we<00:02:27.650> borrowed<00:02:28.069> from<00:02:28.099> the<00:02:28.400> Astronomy

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
something we borrowed from the Astronomy

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:33.220 
something we borrowed from the Astronomy
field<00:02:29.890> where<00:02:30.890> when<00:02:31.069> they<00:02:31.190> look<00:02:31.400> at<00:02:31.520> stars<00:02:32.230> even

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
field where when they look at stars even

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:34.690 
field where when they look at stars even
though<00:02:33.440> you<00:02:33.680> know<00:02:33.770> you<00:02:33.890> see<00:02:34.040> stars<00:02:34.310> twinkling

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
though you know you see stars twinkling

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:35.890 
though you know you see stars twinkling
at<00:02:34.910> night<00:02:35.030> that's<00:02:35.270> because<00:02:35.569> the<00:02:35.720> atmosphere

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
at night that's because the atmosphere

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.930 
at night that's because the atmosphere
is<00:02:36.290> moving<00:02:36.590> things<00:02:36.770> around<00:02:36.920> but<00:02:37.640> every<00:02:37.819> now

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
is moving things around but every now

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.490 
is moving things around but every now
and<00:02:38.090> then<00:02:38.150> they<00:02:38.300> get<00:02:38.390> a<00:02:38.450> very<00:02:38.599> lucky<00:02:39.050> shot<00:02:39.319> of

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
and then they get a very lucky shot of

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.250 
and then they get a very lucky shot of
that<00:02:39.530> star<00:02:40.629> unfortunately<00:02:41.629> for<00:02:41.810> us<00:02:41.840> we<00:02:42.050> have<00:02:42.230> a

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
that star unfortunately for us we have a

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.630 
that star unfortunately for us we have a
whole<00:02:42.470> mountain<00:02:42.650> we<00:02:42.950> want<00:02:43.129> to<00:02:43.220> make<00:02:43.340> a<00:02:43.370> picture

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
whole mountain we want to make a picture

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.640 
whole mountain we want to make a picture
of<00:02:43.909> so<00:02:44.420> we<00:02:44.540> need<00:02:44.689> to<00:02:44.780> get<00:02:44.870> lucky<00:02:45.230> on<00:02:45.319> every

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
of so we need to get lucky on every

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:46.720 
of so we need to get lucky on every
place<00:02:45.950> on<00:02:46.159> that

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
place on that

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.420 
place on that
mountain<00:02:47.120> and<00:02:47.300> through<00:02:47.959> computation<00:02:48.890> were

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
mountain and through computation were

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.759 
mountain and through computation were
able<00:02:49.790> to<00:02:49.940> examine<00:02:50.390> the<00:02:50.840> pixels<00:02:51.290> for<00:02:51.560> every

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
able to examine the pixels for every

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.770 
able to examine the pixels for every
location<00:02:52.129> on<00:02:52.370> that<00:02:52.459> mountain<00:02:52.970> and<00:02:53.180> pick<00:02:53.599> out

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
location on that mountain and pick out

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.080 
location on that mountain and pick out
the<00:02:53.930> one<00:02:54.170> or<00:02:54.409> two<00:02:54.440> or<00:02:54.799> three<00:02:54.830> or<00:02:55.040> four<00:02:55.159> where<00:02:56.060> we

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
the one or two or three or four where we

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.240 
the one or two or three or four where we
get<00:02:56.299> lucky<00:02:56.690> so<00:02:56.930> to<00:02:56.989> speak<00:02:57.319> and<00:02:57.799> get<00:02:57.980> a<00:02:58.010> nice

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
get lucky so to speak and get a nice

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.309 
get lucky so to speak and get a nice
sharp<00:02:58.549> picture<00:02:58.879> of<00:02:59.000> that<00:02:59.120> image<00:02:59.299> finally<00:03:00.230> you

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
sharp picture of that image finally you

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:02.020 
sharp picture of that image finally you
put<00:03:00.440> it<00:03:00.560> all<00:03:00.680> together<00:03:00.860> and<00:03:01.580> we<00:03:01.760> get<00:03:01.879> this

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
put it all together and we get this

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.390 
put it all together and we get this
result
