 cartoon that everyone likes 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.529
 dragon cave 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.279
 the dragon cave a series of 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:35.040
 animation based on a rpg game 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:37.230

 marvel tsr toei animation 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.559
 It's worth remembering that the cartoon had 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.850
 a total of 27 episodes divided into 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.070
 three seasons 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.640
 You must be joking and it was displayed. 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.250
 originally from 1983 to 1986 through the 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.920
 cbs of North American television and a 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.949
 hate vias 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.920
 and here in Brazil the series debuted in 1986 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:01.980
 the xux program and the network 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.980
 globe 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.399
 but it was only in 1994 that the series had 

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:09.940
 his third season here on 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:11.470
 parents 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.350
 It's worth remembering that it was on TV 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.930
 master colossus of the master magicians 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.759
 Wizards good that leaves we are 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.710
 lost again and currently 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:22.030
 discouraged still replayed on 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:23.890
 Brazil on the club channel 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.560
 Closed TV is worth remembering that this channel 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.149
 by brush net globe and the desire rotates in 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.640
 around six children playing in 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:31.390
 a roller coaster end up being 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.610
 teleported to a new 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.890
 dimension that calls the kingdom of dengue ons 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.929
 in two tones and there a lot happens 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.649
 they get new clothes 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:44.020
 clothes make magic magical weapons né e 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:46.569
 some skills exist that the 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.280
 goal of this group is to leave this 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:50.289
 world they want to return our world 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.789
 but do not know how a master of wizards 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:53.319
 always a very character 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:55.149
 Interesting you do not know cartoons. 

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:57.009
 in giving tips 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:58.960
 So you're going to work out and out of nothing. 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.119
 appears on the list appear children 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.890
 with increasingly anxious unable 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.840
 find a portal a way to get back to 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:06.159
 our world, and every episode that 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.170
 he goes on getting more and more 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:11.019
 interesting more villains are showing up 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.239
 more problems some solutions right then 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:15.100
 You need to watch drawings, do not you? 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.799
 has seen demand because neither on the 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.239
 club also had closed the network 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.890
 globe you can watch daily 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.109
 so it was just a little bit the episode 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.670
 of only 27 episodes unfortunately the 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:26.290
 series was canceled due to problems 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.209
 administrative 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.370
 several studies to produce the 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.560
 series and ended up being canceled a lot 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.780
 quickly is unfortunately the series up 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.640
 today did not have the final episode the script 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.410
 He never had a final script for him 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.329
 was produced the final script is in the 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.430
 description of Sunday you will be able to 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:44.230
 know the script of the last episode 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.670
 you do not know the story see at 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.380
 is here in the description of this 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.500
 video that is very worthwhile 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:53.420
 good nobody moves until someone tells me 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:57.080
 Who is this who is that? 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.970
 The sound is worth remembering that the last episode 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.920
 ends up delivering was written by him the 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.349
 writer mike riley sometimes is not 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.020
 important how quickly ahead 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:07.940
 but rather that it presents itself 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.250
 despite the children liked very much 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.470
 drawing the child's parents did not like it 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.090
 not at all because they carry 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.890
 a very violent design that does not 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.840
 condition was removed from the air 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.550
 I did not want a drawing more in the air but 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.709
 fortunately did not happen until some 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.630
 bodies regulating television in the 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:25.430
 Brazil in Argentina and the United States 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.959
 and in several countries tried to take the 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.060
 design but could not and has 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.340
 made a conversation and such and finally launches 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.290
 line can be displayed only 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.420
 had to have a warning of violence in the 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.340
 beginning of each episode, and informed the 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.370
 lipor viewer has a bit of 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.440
 caution and the right age to watch and 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.130
 now let's go to the cave curiosities 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:47.390
 of the dragon 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:49.190
 open the head the first curiosity you 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.110
 knows the first name given to the drawing was 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.370
 sword and witchcraft. 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:56.360
 time that the design was presented to the 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:59.120
 channel displays if you declined the second 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.519
 Did you know that in France the 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:07.090
 name of the drawing is the smile of the dragon 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:07.090
 with a dragon smile or dragon smile 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.240
 because thankfully we are Brazilians is 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:16.670
 that he has a little bit better name 

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:19.340
 né dragon cave third 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:20.930
 curiosity and organize the producers 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.940
 They did not want to put god in the drawing. 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.680
 because they thought that by placing gods 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.510
 the religious were a little angry 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.490
 and that's why the producers found 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.650
 better I will not put no problem 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.690
 with these people these fanatics there we go 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.550
 close, let's leave the gods and 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.830
 druses from outside and then they will 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.490
 quietly watch the cave of the 

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.610
 Dragon 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.950
 Bizarre, it takes a long river or 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:46.100
 Then a charm will be broken and I tried 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.540
 my fourth throne is curiosity and 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.130
 first transmission of charge in the dragon 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:52.520
 happened on the islands there in the states 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:56.750
 united on September 17, 1983 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:59.510
 at nine-thirty the fifth morning 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:01.520
 curiosity you noticed the drawing did not 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:02.930
 has official theme song but two 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.850
 countries decided to produce their own 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:08.020
 theme song for the dragon cave that 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.020
 were spain and france 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.930
 this curiosity is that you knew that the 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.070
 main causes of the cancellation of 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:20.620
 dragon cave to our sadness 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.420
 were given to the high cost of production and 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.130
 to the beijing of the audience because it is 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:26.020
 compete at the same time 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:31.210
 brothers who were becoming feverish there 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:33.340
 united states 7 last curiosity 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.870
 and now we have a little curiosity 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.370
 controversy because my research point 

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.880
 points for example was released in Brazil 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:41.950
 in the xo program of xuxa but it has 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.960
 another bridge that points out that it was 84 in the 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:46.690
 magic balloon program that also from the 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.580
 Globe was from the globe network and now you

 Do you know the answer you really remember? 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.760
 because I'm 92 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:53.530
