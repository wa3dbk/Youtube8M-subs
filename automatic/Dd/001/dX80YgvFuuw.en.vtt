00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:14.190
 there all quiet uncompromising personal 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.070
 for you a video of an infinite rt 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.990
 here in the capture of gta 5 online 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.330
 Let me explain to you that as 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.130
 The capture link works and it will be 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.410
 in a description and if you do not understand 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.010
 this explanation is leaving us 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.619
 commented on the destruction of the Indian in the 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.719
 video of a colleague of mine I recorded I was 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.680
 playing to record he helped me record 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.750
 the video here 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.030
 and then you will understand that it gives a 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.930
 Someone who is sure that you 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.079
 will understand 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:46.170
 then it is first necessary to place 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.890
 seven rounds and another from a friend to 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.350
 to help 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:54.090
 So when the capture starts and it's just 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:57.239
 you get to talk about when UFMT 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.460
 realize that it has stopped going down and that 's it 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.629
 start delivering the blotches there in the 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:06.060
 bottom of the lobby right then I left 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.060
 You need a friend to help you. 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.330
 He can stand still or on the phone. 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.580
 each one is 7 and so to give certain world 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.439
 wins or if not then when you 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.130
 realize that you have stopped booting 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.130
 kill nobody 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:29.460
 the right rp 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.979
 so come on and then we'll know what 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:36.990
 while you will gain from reef 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:39.780
 in total the match that will kill 26 rpc 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.619
 and that will sprout the rf 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:47.579
 then each one percent board 25 drt 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:51.270
 totaling 600 650 drp each brand 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:55.009
 collected you get up to 25 rp being 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:58.500
 eight then 200 more drp to each suitcase 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:01.560
 delivered and earns approximately 100 gr 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:08.710
 Delivery time then eight suitcases gives one 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:11.590
 total of 800 grp to win 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:17.770
 And there it is if you have lost the round 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:20.020
 wins around 150 120 is and so here 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.520
 or in the end if you will win for seven 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.600
 rounds and will receive a total of 12 thousand 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.080
 950 drp 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.570
 So it's a good feeling, leaving is very fast and 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.690
 show security capture of about ten 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:37.960
 times received a total of 129 thousand 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.060
 five hundred and repeat rp speak right 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.250
 and then we got to miss and everyone 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.630
 wants the boy to buy the best 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.510
 guns right there 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.610
 so it might be that the help I did not like 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:52.050
 This team did everything here to help 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.050
 said that's the point
