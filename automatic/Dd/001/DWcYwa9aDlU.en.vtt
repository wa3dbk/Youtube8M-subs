was<00:02:40.940> primarily<00:02:41.450> all<00:02:41.660> mid-range<00:02:42.170> but<00:02:43.099> they

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
was primarily all mid-range but they

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.880 
was primarily all mid-range but they
relied<00:02:43.489> on<00:02:43.520> the<00:02:43.670> showmanship<00:02:44.180> and<00:02:45.080> that's

relied on the showmanship and that's

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.740 
relied on the showmanship and that's
kind<00:02:46.280> of<00:02:46.340> where<00:02:46.520> like<00:02:46.700> my<00:02:46.849> mixers<00:02:47.300> and<00:02:47.540> things

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
kind of where like my mixers and things

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.900 
kind of where like my mixers and things
come<00:02:48.020> from<00:02:48.200> that<00:02:48.410> I<00:02:48.440> do<00:02:48.640> instead<00:02:49.640> of<00:02:49.700> just

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:49.910 
come from that I do instead of just

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.430 
come from that I do instead of just
straight<00:02:50.060> performing<00:02:50.599> music<00:02:50.690> and<00:02:51.140> you<00:02:51.319> know

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
beat mixing and things like that we

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.520 
beat mixing and things like that we
didn't<00:02:53.060> rely<00:02:53.300> on<00:02:53.510> that<00:02:53.660> we<00:02:53.810> relied<00:02:54.140> on<00:02:54.170> the

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
didn't rely on that we relied on the

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.339 
didn't rely on that we relied on the
showmanship<00:02:55.069> ah<00:02:55.310> and<00:02:56.270> I<00:02:56.450> have<00:02:56.569> discovered<00:02:57.170> or

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
showmanship ah and I have discovered or

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
come come to the conclusion that I've

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.360 
come come to the conclusion that I've
gotten<00:02:59.930> away<00:02:59.989> from<00:03:00.410> a<00:03:00.470> lot<00:03:00.620> of<00:03:00.709> my<00:03:00.830> showmanship

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370
