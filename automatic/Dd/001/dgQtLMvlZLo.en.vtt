look for Intel desktop control center

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.700 
look for Intel desktop control center
and<00:00:47.450> we've<00:00:48.450> loaded<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.930> already<00:00:49.200> so<00:00:49.590> I'll

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
and we've loaded it already so I'll

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.880 
and we've loaded it already so I'll
start<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.070> up<00:00:50.840> it'll<00:00:51.840> load<00:00:52.079> here<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.530> then

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
it'll bring us up to the application and

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.470 
it'll bring us up to the application and
take<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.710> couple<00:00:58.949> seconds<00:00:59.340> okay<00:01:00.090> this<00:01:00.329> is<00:01:00.390> what

little bit about your memory and your
memory<00:01:27.840> timing<00:01:28.290> alright<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.280> then<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:29.549> shows

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
memory timing alright and then it shows

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.030 
memory timing alright and then it shows
you<00:01:29.909> your<00:01:30.240> speed<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.810> your<00:01:31.049> different<00:01:31.740> buses

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
you your speed of your different buses

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.940 
you your speed of your different buses
so<00:01:32.130> your<00:01:32.280> PCI<00:01:32.579> Express<00:01:33.570> bus<00:01:33.869> your<00:01:34.110> PCI<00:01:34.380> bus<00:01:34.470> and

auto-tune<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:44.939> once<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:45.930> click<00:01:46.049> auto-tune

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
auto-tune and once you click auto-tune

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.950 
auto-tune and once you click auto-tune
and<00:01:46.590> give<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:47.040> warning<00:01:47.759> here<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.270> then<00:01:48.810> it'll

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
and give you warning here and then it'll

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.440 
and give you warning here and then it'll
go<00:01:49.200> through<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.770> it'll<00:01:49.860> basically<00:01:50.390> allow<00:01:51.390> you

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
go through and it'll basically allow you

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.170 
go through and it'll basically allow you
to<00:01:51.899> do<00:01:52.860> all<00:01:53.070> of<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.369> stuff<00:01:53.579> that<00:01:53.759> we<00:01:53.850> did<00:01:54.030> in

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
to do all of the stuff that we did in

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.170 
to do all of the stuff that we did in
the<00:01:54.270> BIOS<00:01:54.659> it'll<00:01:55.079> do<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.320> automatically<00:01:55.770> okay

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.539 

let's<00:02:00.180> go<00:02:00.479> here<00:02:00.840> we're<00:02:01.439> going<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.590> there's<00:02:02.490> a

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
let's go here we're going to there's a

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.280 
let's go here we're going to there's a
couple<00:02:02.759> of<00:02:02.880> settings<00:02:03.060> here<00:02:03.270> in<00:02:03.479> this<00:02:03.750> it's

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
couple of settings here in this it's

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.050 
couple of settings here in this it's
basically<00:02:04.439> saying<00:02:04.979> how<00:02:05.189> extreme<00:02:05.700> do<00:02:05.820> you<00:02:05.880> want

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
basically saying how extreme do you want

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.760 
basically saying how extreme do you want
to<00:02:06.149> do<00:02:06.270> this<00:02:06.450> I'm<00:02:06.899> going<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.229> go<00:02:07.320> push<00:02:07.530> it<00:02:07.680> all

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
to do this I'm going to go push it all

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.139 
to do this I'm going to go push it all
the<00:02:07.890> way<00:02:08.009> or<00:02:08.160> do<00:02:08.250> you<00:02:08.310> want<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.520> kind<00:02:08.640> of<00:02:08.789> be<00:02:08.940> a

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
the way or do you want to kind of be a

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.430 
the way or do you want to kind of be a
little<00:02:09.209> bit<00:02:09.420> conservative<00:02:09.810> we'll<00:02:10.140> leave<00:02:10.289> it

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
little bit conservative we'll leave it

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.360 
little bit conservative we'll leave it
at<00:02:10.560> the

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
at the

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.789 
at the
um<00:02:11.959> conservative<00:02:12.959> kind<00:02:13.260> of<00:02:13.409> a<00:02:13.470> conservative

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:13.799 
um conservative kind of a conservative

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:18.350 
um conservative kind of a conservative
space<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:15.230> we'll<00:02:16.230> let<00:02:17.040> it<00:02:17.190> do<00:02:17.459> its<00:02:17.489> thing<00:02:17.700> okay

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
space and we'll let it do its thing okay

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.059 
space and we'll let it do its thing okay
and<00:02:18.629> then<00:02:18.870> once<00:02:19.110> you<00:02:19.230> let<00:02:19.409> it<00:02:19.500> do<00:02:19.560> its<00:02:19.590> thing<00:02:19.769> it

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
and then once you let it do its thing it

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:21.740 
and then once you let it do its thing it
just<00:02:20.099> kind<00:02:20.400> of<00:02:20.459> runs<00:02:20.670> through<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.209> it<00:02:21.269> was

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
just kind of runs through and it was

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.270 
just kind of runs through and it was
what<00:02:21.930> it<00:02:22.019> does<00:02:22.140> is<00:02:22.260> it<00:02:22.349> basically<00:02:22.470> tests<00:02:23.069> all

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
what it does is it basically tests all

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.770 
what it does is it basically tests all
your<00:02:23.489> system<00:02:23.849> hardware<00:02:24.180> different<00:02:24.480> settings

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
your system hardware different settings

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.330 
your system hardware different settings
to<00:02:24.989> figure<00:02:25.230> out<00:02:25.349> what's<00:02:25.950> going<00:02:26.129> to<00:02:26.159> work

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
to figure out what's going to work

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.220 
to figure out what's going to work
exactly<00:02:26.909> it<00:02:27.239> goes<00:02:27.450> through<00:02:27.659> in<00:02:27.750> a<00:02:27.810> picture

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
exactly it goes through in a picture

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.069 
exactly it goes through in a picture
optimal<00:02:28.829> your<00:02:29.730> optimal<00:02:30.180> overclocking

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:31.079 
optimal your optimal overclocking

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:33.530 
optimal your optimal overclocking
settings<00:02:31.440> all<00:02:32.129> right<00:02:32.280> so<00:02:32.430> it's<00:02:33.000> gone<00:02:33.209> through

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
settings all right so it's gone through

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.300 
settings all right so it's gone through
it's<00:02:33.840> done<00:02:34.049> its<00:02:34.200> auto<00:02:34.409> tune<00:02:34.739> when<00:02:35.280> you

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
it's done its auto tune when you

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.770 
it's done its auto tune when you
actually<00:02:35.519> do<00:02:35.849> it<00:02:35.879> with<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.209> software<00:02:36.510> you<00:02:36.690> see

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
actually do it with the software you see

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.390 
actually do it with the software you see
the<00:02:36.870> computer<00:02:37.170> reboot<00:02:37.500> a<00:02:37.620> bunch<00:02:37.799> of<00:02:37.920> times<00:02:38.159> it

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
the computer reboot a bunch of times it

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.970 
the computer reboot a bunch of times it
goes<00:02:38.519> through<00:02:38.730> scans<00:02:39.150> everything<00:02:39.690> so<00:02:40.319> what's

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
goes through scans everything so what's

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.280 
goes through scans everything so what's
the<00:02:41.129> result<00:02:41.489> of<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:42.150> of<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.659> auto-tune<00:02:42.989> what

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
the result of the of the auto-tune what

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.289 
the result of the of the auto-tune what
we're<00:02:43.410> being<00:02:43.530> told<00:02:43.859> by<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.220> software<00:02:44.790> so<00:02:45.180> at

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
we're being told by the software so at

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:47.839 
we're being told by the software so at
the<00:02:45.390> end<00:02:45.540> you<00:02:45.750> get<00:02:45.930> a<00:02:45.989> summary<00:02:46.290> and<00:02:46.620> it<00:02:47.519> shows

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
the end you get a summary and it shows

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:49.520 
the end you get a summary and it shows
you<00:02:48.000> that<00:02:48.150> just<00:02:48.629> the<00:02:48.750> same<00:02:48.989> thing<00:02:49.290> that<00:02:49.440> you

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
you that just the same thing that you

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.869 
you that just the same thing that you
would<00:02:49.650> see<00:02:49.829> in<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:49.980> BIOS<00:02:50.340> it<00:02:50.489> shows<00:02:50.670> you<00:02:50.760> the

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
would see in the BIOS it shows you the

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:52.460 
would see in the BIOS it shows you the
default<00:02:51.060> should<00:02:51.540> either<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.900> original<00:02:52.019> where

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
default should either the original where

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.780 
default should either the original where
you<00:02:52.530> started<00:02:52.920> and<00:02:53.069> it<00:02:53.250> shows<00:02:53.430> you<00:02:53.549> what's

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
you started and it shows you what's

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.420 
you started and it shows you what's
active<00:02:54.209> and<00:02:55.079> so<00:02:55.200> what<00:02:55.440> we've<00:02:55.590> done<00:02:55.829> is<00:02:55.890> we've

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
active and so what we've done is we've

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.339 
active and so what we've done is we've
increased<00:02:56.909> the<00:02:57.150> things<00:02:57.900> that<00:02:58.019> you<00:02:58.109> really

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
increased the things that you really

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.170 
increased the things that you really
want<00:02:58.500> to<00:02:58.620> look<00:02:58.709> at<00:02:58.890> are<00:02:59.129> the<00:02:59.280> four<00:02:59.519> core<00:02:59.760> ratio

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
want to look at are the four core ratio

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.780 
want to look at are the four core ratio
limit<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:01.290> three<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.890> two<00:03:02.069> and<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.370> one<00:03:02.400> core

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
limit the three the two and the one core

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.729 
limit the three the two and the one core
ratio<00:03:03.150> limit<00:03:03.420> so<00:03:03.540> quad<00:03:03.720> core<00:03:03.959> ratio<00:03:04.319> limit<00:03:04.620> is

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
ratio limit so quad core ratio limit is

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:06.770 
ratio limit so quad core ratio limit is
how<00:03:05.459> fast<00:03:05.730> am<00:03:05.940> I<00:03:06.000> going<00:03:06.120> to<00:03:06.209> be<00:03:06.299> running<00:03:06.569> if<00:03:06.659> I'm

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
how fast am I going to be running if I'm

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.259 
how fast am I going to be running if I'm
only<00:03:06.959> using<00:03:07.409> one<00:03:07.530> core<00:03:07.920> alright<00:03:08.340> so<00:03:08.579> that<00:03:08.760> the

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
only using one core alright so that the

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.440 
only using one core alright so that the
the<00:03:09.629> ratio<00:03:10.200> was<00:03:10.379> 28<00:03:10.829> so<00:03:10.980> it's<00:03:11.129> 28<00:03:11.489> times<00:03:11.940> the

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
the ratio was 28 so it's 28 times the

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.449 
the ratio was 28 so it's 28 times the
frequency<00:03:12.989> is<00:03:13.109> gonna<00:03:13.260> be<00:03:13.319> 28<00:03:13.680> times<00:03:13.980> the<00:03:14.250> base

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
frequency is gonna be 28 times the base

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.300 
frequency is gonna be 28 times the base
clock<00:03:14.730> which<00:03:15.060> 130<00:03:15.540> over<00:03:15.690> 133<00:03:16.380> I<00:03:16.590> didn't<00:03:17.160> change

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
clock which 130 over 133 I didn't change

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.819 
clock which 130 over 133 I didn't change
the<00:03:17.400> base<00:03:17.609> clock<00:03:17.849> but<00:03:18.450> what<00:03:18.599> it<00:03:18.690> did<00:03:18.870> it<00:03:19.169> did<00:03:19.560> is

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
the base clock but what it did it did is

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.580 
the base clock but what it did it did is
up<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:20.459> CPU<00:03:20.849> voltage<00:03:21.000> and<00:03:21.540> I<00:03:22.049> think<00:03:22.260> it<00:03:22.380> upped

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
up the CPU voltage and I think it upped

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.089 
up the CPU voltage and I think it upped
some<00:03:23.069> of<00:03:23.459> the<00:03:23.780> current<00:03:24.780> and<00:03:24.930> wattage<00:03:25.560> over

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
some of the current and wattage over

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:28.250 
some of the current and wattage over
override<00:03:26.879> limits<00:03:27.299> right<00:03:27.629> basically<00:03:27.900> just

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
override limits right basically just

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.089 
override limits right basically just
gave<00:03:28.650> it<00:03:28.829> a<00:03:28.919> little<00:03:29.010> more<00:03:29.280> freedom<00:03:29.879> to<00:03:31.099> absorb

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:32.099 
gave it a little more freedom to absorb

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:33.500 
gave it a little more freedom to absorb
a<00:03:32.190> little<00:03:32.370> more<00:03:32.459> sink<00:03:33.000> a<00:03:33.030> little<00:03:33.120> more<00:03:33.299> power

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
a little more sink a little more power

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.180 
a little more sink a little more power
if<00:03:33.690> our<00:03:34.049> machine<00:03:34.349> maybe<00:03:34.530> had<00:03:34.799> like<00:03:34.829> better

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
if our machine maybe had like better

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.030 
if our machine maybe had like better
cooling<00:03:35.760> and<00:03:35.970> all<00:03:36.030> that<00:03:36.180> just<00:03:36.500> got<00:03:37.500> a<00:03:37.560> little

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
cooling and all that just got a little

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.409 
cooling and all that just got a little
bit<00:03:38.190> right<00:03:38.430> all<00:03:38.639> that's<00:03:38.849> gonna<00:03:39.000> affect<00:03:39.090> and

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:39.419 
bit right all that's gonna affect and

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:41.059 
bit right all that's gonna affect and
it's<00:03:39.540> an<00:03:39.690> issue<00:03:40.019> as<00:03:40.290> well<00:03:40.470> and<00:03:40.680> this<00:03:40.799> is<00:03:40.919> also

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
it's an issue as well and this is also

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.759 
it's an issue as well and this is also
giving<00:03:41.519> us<00:03:41.639> kind<00:03:42.120> of<00:03:42.180> a<00:03:42.239> baseline<00:03:42.599> that<00:03:43.470> we<00:03:43.590> can

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
giving us kind of a baseline that we can

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.740 
giving us kind of a baseline that we can
then<00:03:43.949> enable<00:03:44.280> a<00:03:44.669> baseline<00:03:45.150> right<00:03:45.299> stable

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
then enable a baseline right stable

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.449 
then enable a baseline right stable
configure<00:03:46.109> so<00:03:46.290> so<00:03:46.470> now<00:03:46.620> we<00:03:46.680> have<00:03:46.919> this<00:03:47.220> nice

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
configure so so now we have this nice

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:48.949 
configure so so now we have this nice
baseline<00:03:47.910> that<00:03:48.060> we<00:03:48.299> can<00:03:48.540> then<00:03:48.660> take<00:03:48.720> the

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
baseline that we can then take the

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.050 
baseline that we can then take the
software<00:03:49.410> and<00:03:49.680> start<00:03:49.949> start<00:03:50.489> tweaking<00:03:50.760> from

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
software and start start tweaking from

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.280 
software and start start tweaking from
there<00:03:51.209> crank<00:03:51.480> and<00:03:51.599> more<00:03:51.780> stuff<00:03:51.959> up<00:03:52.079> right

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
there crank and more stuff up right

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.360 
there crank and more stuff up right
alright<00:03:52.650> so<00:03:52.709> how<00:03:52.919> do<00:03:52.980> we<00:03:53.040> do<00:03:53.160> that<00:03:53.310> because

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
alright so how do we do that because

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.009 
alright so how do we do that because
because<00:03:54.000> this<00:03:54.120> stuff<00:03:54.299> is<00:03:54.389> really<00:03:54.569> really<00:03:54.660> cool

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
because this stuff is really really cool

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.170 
because this stuff is really really cool
what's<00:03:55.290> the<00:03:55.440> what's<00:03:56.129> like<00:03:56.310> like<00:03:56.579> like<00:03:56.940> what

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
what's the what's like like like what

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.699 
what's the what's like like like what
like<00:03:57.389> how<00:03:57.540> in<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:57.750> software<00:03:58.199> would<00:03:58.410> you<00:03:58.530> then

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
like how in the software would you then

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.030 
like how in the software would you then
move<00:03:58.980> on<00:03:59.250> to<00:03:59.549> to<00:04:00.510> continuing<00:04:01.440> to<00:04:01.470> increase<00:04:01.889> the

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
move on to to continuing to increase the

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.740 
move on to to continuing to increase the
speed<00:04:02.220> of<00:04:02.280> the<00:04:02.430> system<00:04:02.579> sure<00:04:03.060> so<00:04:03.299> you<00:04:03.389> can<00:04:03.599> go

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
speed of the system sure so you can go

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.619 
speed of the system sure so you can go
back<00:04:03.930> to<00:04:04.290> the<00:04:04.799> the<00:04:05.190> app<00:04:05.340> itself<00:04:05.699> okay<00:04:06.150> right

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629 
back to the the app itself okay right

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:09.710 
back to the the app itself okay right
and<00:04:06.810> then<00:04:07.139> you<00:04:07.500> can<00:04:07.530> go<00:04:07.769> you<00:04:08.579> can<00:04:08.639> hit<00:04:08.910> modify

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
and then you can go you can hit modify

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.270 
and then you can go you can hit modify
here<00:04:10.169> and<00:04:10.379> then<00:04:10.500> it'll<00:04:10.680> give<00:04:10.889> you<00:04:11.010> a<00:04:11.040> warning

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
here and then it'll give you a warning

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.970 
here and then it'll give you a warning
saying<00:04:11.579> that<00:04:11.669> you're<00:04:11.849> a<00:04:11.970> danger<00:04:12.150> stuff<00:04:12.980> it'll

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
saying that you're a danger stuff it'll

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.640 
saying that you're a danger stuff it'll
bring<00:04:14.129> up<00:04:14.280> a<00:04:14.370> screen<00:04:14.489> so<00:04:15.090> we<00:04:15.269> can<00:04:15.389> go<00:04:15.569> in<00:04:15.810> and<00:04:16.289> we

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
bring up a screen so we can go in and we

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.080 
bring up a screen so we can go in and we
can<00:04:16.739> start<00:04:16.979> changing<00:04:17.160> things<00:04:17.549> just<00:04:17.760> kind<00:04:18.030> of

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
can start changing things just kind of

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.180 
can start changing things just kind of
changed<00:04:18.389> in<00:04:18.510> the<00:04:18.570> BIOS<00:04:18.930> right<00:04:19.349> same<00:04:19.620> same

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
changed in the BIOS right same same

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.640 
changed in the BIOS right same same
types<00:04:20.549> of<00:04:20.669> settings<00:04:21.030> here<00:04:21.169> we<00:04:22.169> can<00:04:22.289> go<00:04:22.409> there

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
types of settings here we can go there

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.620 
types of settings here we can go there
we<00:04:22.800> can<00:04:22.919> apply<00:04:23.190> it<00:04:23.250> and<00:04:23.550> then<00:04:23.760> basically<00:04:24.450> the

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
we can apply it and then basically the

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:25.040 
we can apply it and then basically the
system

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
system

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.279

00:04:28.279 --> 00:04:28.289 
take care of the updating some of these

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:30.649 
take care of the updating some of these
have<00:04:28.530> you<00:04:28.830> know<00:04:29.190> are<00:04:29.430> required<00:04:29.849> to<00:04:30.060> reboot<00:04:30.389> so

00:04:30.649 --> 00:04:30.659 
have you know are required to reboot so

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:32.779 
have you know are required to reboot so

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
software now we were talking we were

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.330 
software now we were talking we were
talking<00:04:34.050> about<00:04:34.319> this<00:04:34.530> that<00:04:34.830> this<00:04:35.039> motherboard

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:35.340 
talking about this that this motherboard

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.300 
talking about this that this motherboard
has<00:04:35.789> a<00:04:36.150> button<00:04:36.990> on<00:04:37.169> it<00:04:37.229> that<00:04:37.620> we're<00:04:37.949> at<00:04:38.039> so<00:04:38.190> that

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
has a button on it that we're at so that

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.680 
has a button on it that we're at so that
will<00:04:38.460> allow<00:04:38.669> you<00:04:38.729> that<00:04:39.210> if<00:04:39.300> everything<00:04:39.539> goes

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
will allow you that if everything goes

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:40.999 
will allow you that if everything goes
wrong<00:04:39.930> you<00:04:40.169> push<00:04:40.319> the<00:04:40.409> button<00:04:40.680> in<00:04:40.740> it<00:04:40.860> and

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:41.009 
wrong you push the button in it and

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:43.100 
wrong you push the button in it and
everything<00:04:41.400> goes<00:04:41.970> back<00:04:42.210> right<00:04:42.509> fault<00:04:42.810> it'll

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
everything goes back right fault it'll

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.779 
everything goes back right fault it'll
bring<00:04:43.229> you<00:04:43.349> back<00:04:43.560> to<00:04:43.590> your<00:04:43.770> default<00:04:44.039> bias<00:04:44.490> um

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:44.789 
bring you back to your default bias um

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:47.629 
bring you back to your default bias um
if<00:04:45.150> if<00:04:45.569> you<00:04:45.930> don't<00:04:46.199> have<00:04:46.409> that<00:04:46.680> and<00:04:46.949> you've<00:04:47.370> got

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 
if if you don't have that and you've got

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:49.790 
if if you don't have that and you've got
it<00:04:47.789> and<00:04:47.909> you<00:04:48.330> take<00:04:48.569> the<00:04:49.050> software<00:04:49.470> pushes

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
it and you take the software pushes

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.320 
it and you take the software pushes
things<00:04:50.009> too<00:04:50.220> far<00:04:50.460> what's<00:04:50.819> the<00:04:50.970> what's<00:04:51.270> the

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
things too far what's the what's the

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.730 
things too far what's the what's the
result<00:04:51.629> so<00:04:51.870> there's<00:04:52.020> a<00:04:52.080> couple<00:04:52.229> of<00:04:52.409> things<00:04:52.530> it

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
result so there's a couple of things it

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.080 
result so there's a couple of things it
depends<00:04:53.099> on<00:04:53.159> your<00:04:53.310> bias<00:04:53.520> okay

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
depends on your bias okay

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.450 
depends on your bias okay
depends<00:04:55.050> on<00:04:55.139> the<00:04:55.319> board<00:04:55.740> manufacturer<00:04:56.340> but

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
depends on the board manufacturer but

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:57.499 
depends on the board manufacturer but
there's<00:04:56.639> a<00:04:56.699> couple<00:04:56.879> of<00:04:57.000> different<00:04:57.240> things<00:04:57.270> so

00:04:57.499 --> 00:04:57.509 
there's a couple of different things so

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:00.379 
there's a couple of different things so
this<00:04:57.690> board<00:04:57.900> has<00:04:58.110> three<00:04:58.379> different<00:04:59.000> I<00:05:00.000> guess

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389 
this board has three different I guess

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:02.930 
this board has three different I guess
you<00:05:00.509> could<00:05:00.629> say<00:05:01.340> overrides<00:05:02.340> failsafe

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
you could say overrides failsafe

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.029 
you could say overrides failsafe
fail-safes<00:05:03.719> right<00:05:03.930> exactly<00:05:04.319> fail-safes<00:05:04.770> to

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 
fail-safes right exactly fail-safes to

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:06.770 
fail-safes right exactly fail-safes to
get<00:05:05.430> back<00:05:05.580> to<00:05:05.759> your<00:05:05.849> regular<00:05:06.090> bias<00:05:06.479> so<00:05:06.659> it's

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
get back to your regular bias so it's

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.659 
get back to your regular bias so it's
got<00:05:06.900> a<00:05:06.930> watchdog<00:05:07.409> timer<00:05:07.770> social<00:05:08.159> system<00:05:08.490> never

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:08.669 
got a watchdog timer social system never

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:11.149 
got a watchdog timer social system never
boots<00:05:08.969> it'll<00:05:09.569> say<00:05:09.690> it'll<00:05:10.080> figure<00:05:10.259> hey<00:05:10.860> well

00:05:11.149 --> 00:05:11.159 
boots it'll say it'll figure hey well

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:12.619 
boots it'll say it'll figure hey well
something<00:05:11.430> went<00:05:11.580> wrong<00:05:11.759> I'm<00:05:12.120> going<00:05:12.449> to<00:05:12.509> go

00:05:12.619 --> 00:05:12.629 
something went wrong I'm going to go

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:14.749 
something went wrong I'm going to go
back<00:05:12.780> and<00:05:12.960> change<00:05:13.199> the<00:05:13.469> settings<00:05:14.400> back<00:05:14.580> and

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:14.759 
back and change the settings back and

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:17.119 
back and change the settings back and
you'll<00:05:15.060> see<00:05:15.210> a<00:05:15.240> message<00:05:16.139> up<00:05:16.349> you<00:05:16.740> see<00:05:17.099> a

00:05:17.119 --> 00:05:17.129 
you'll see a message up you see a

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:18.499 
you'll see a message up you see a
message<00:05:17.310> come<00:05:17.610> up<00:05:17.729> when<00:05:17.879> the<00:05:17.940> system<00:05:18.210> reboots

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:18.509 
message come up when the system reboots

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:20.450 
message come up when the system reboots
so<00:05:19.259> that's<00:05:19.440> the<00:05:19.530> watchdog<00:05:19.979> fail-safe

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
so that's the watchdog fail-safe

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.520 
so that's the watchdog fail-safe
watchdog<00:05:20.940> timer<00:05:21.240> then<00:05:21.750> you<00:05:21.870> have<00:05:22.020> the<00:05:22.169> back<00:05:22.319> to

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
watchdog timer then you have the back to

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.409 
watchdog timer then you have the back to
bias<00:05:22.740> button<00:05:23.129> on<00:05:23.280> for<00:05:23.610> this<00:05:23.729> particular<00:05:24.180> board

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 
bias button on for this particular board

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:27.140 
bias button on for this particular board
then<00:05:24.870> ultimately<00:05:25.860> if<00:05:26.099> you<00:05:26.250> you<00:05:26.580> have<00:05:26.789> if<00:05:27.030> you

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
then ultimately if you you have if you

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.240 
then ultimately if you you have if you
screw<00:05:27.509> it<00:05:27.569> up<00:05:27.629> so<00:05:27.870> bad<00:05:28.110> that<00:05:28.409> you<00:05:28.650> can't<00:05:28.680> get

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
screw it up so bad that you can't get

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:30.980 
screw it up so bad that you can't get
back<00:05:29.460> then<00:05:29.759> you<00:05:29.880> can<00:05:30.000> do<00:05:30.120> the<00:05:30.240> CMOS<00:05:30.569> clear<00:05:30.840> and

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
back then you can do the CMOS clear and

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.390 
back then you can do the CMOS clear and
that<00:05:31.110> will<00:05:31.229> set<00:05:31.440> reset<00:05:31.800> all<00:05:31.979> your<00:05:32.130> CMOS

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
that will set reset all your CMOS

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.800 
that will set reset all your CMOS
settings<00:05:32.759> cool<00:05:33.060> but<00:05:33.210> this<00:05:33.330> is<00:05:33.449> definitely<00:05:33.690> a

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:33.810 
settings cool but this is definitely a

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.330 
settings cool but this is definitely a
really<00:05:33.870> cool<00:05:34.440> way<00:05:34.620> to<00:05:34.650> be<00:05:34.919> able<00:05:35.099> to<00:05:35.159> start

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:35.340 
really cool way to be able to start

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:36.680 
really cool way to be able to start
getting<00:05:35.400> into<00:05:35.789> this<00:05:35.969> stuff<00:05:36.240> so<00:05:36.389> if<00:05:36.479> you<00:05:36.569> get

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 
here it's real easy to use and then once

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:51.230 
here it's real easy to use and then once
you<00:05:49.949> start<00:05:50.009> doing<00:05:50.250> this<00:05:50.520> then<00:05:50.759> you<00:05:50.789> can<00:05:50.969> start

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 
you start doing this then you can start

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.469 
you start doing this then you can start
adding<00:05:51.990> the<00:05:52.469> sweet<00:05:53.190> cooling<00:05:53.699> systems<00:05:54.210> in<00:05:54.389> my
