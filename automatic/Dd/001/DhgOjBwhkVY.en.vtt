hey<00:00:55.379> what<00:00:55.860> do<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:56.010> see<00:00:56.190> down<00:00:56.370> here<00:00:56.610> Oh<00:00:56.760> a<00:00:56.789> it's

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
hey what do I see down here Oh a it's

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.389 
hey what do I see down here Oh a it's
just<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.510> gears<00:00:57.750> not<00:00:57.930> binocular<00:00:58.620> these<00:00:59.250> are

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
just the gears not binocular these are

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.069 
just the gears not binocular these are
the<00:00:59.460> two<00:00:59.609> gears<00:00:59.850> out<00:01:00.120> of<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.270> Chevy<00:01:00.600> pumps<00:01:00.930> we

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
the two gears out of the Chevy pumps we

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.599 
the two gears out of the Chevy pumps we
got<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.350> one-inch<00:01:01.680> five<00:01:01.920> hundred<00:01:02.250> thousand

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
got the one-inch five hundred thousand

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:03.830 
got the one-inch five hundred thousand
so<00:01:02.699> I've<00:01:02.760> got<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.000> one-inch<00:01:03.359> two<00:01:03.539> hundred

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
so I've got the one-inch two hundred

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.289 
so I've got the one-inch two hundred
thousand<00:01:04.290> it's<00:01:04.680> real<00:01:04.949> obvious<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.580> see<00:01:05.820> the

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
thousand it's real obvious to see the

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.539 
thousand it's real obvious to see the
length<00:01:06.570> difference<00:01:07.380> in<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.650> gears<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.100> it's

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
length difference in the gears and it's

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.219 
length difference in the gears and it's
that<00:01:08.729> length<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.240> produces<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.900> difference

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
that length that produces the difference

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.510 
that length that produces the difference
in<00:01:10.380> volumes<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.979> difference<00:01:11.280> between<00:01:11.369> a

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
in volumes the difference between a

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.310 
in volumes the difference between a
standard<00:01:11.790> volume<00:01:12.360> there<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:12.840> between<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.110> high

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
with a standard volume gear you need a

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.969
