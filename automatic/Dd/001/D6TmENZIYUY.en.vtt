steelix<00:00:45.210> he<00:00:45.420> does<00:00:45.570> go<00:00:45.719> for<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.899> fire<00:00:46.110> punch<00:00:46.379> I

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
steelix he does go for the fire punch I

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.950 
steelix he does go for the fire punch I
thought<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:47.489> was<00:00:47.700> prediction<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.600> might

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
thought that was prediction it might

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.410 
thought that was prediction it might
have<00:00:49.079> been<00:00:49.230> I<00:00:49.440> don't<00:00:49.680> know<00:00:49.829> but<00:00:50.210> turns<00:00:51.210> out<00:00:51.300> he

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
have been I don't know but turns out he

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.600 
have been I don't know but turns out he
does<00:00:51.539> have<00:00:51.719> aqua<00:00:52.050> tail<00:00:52.199> as<00:00:52.410> well<00:00:52.590> so<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:53.190> mean<00:00:53.550> I

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
does have aqua tail as well so I mean I

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.020 
does have aqua tail as well so I mean I
guess<00:00:53.640> either<00:00:54.059> his<00:00:54.420> steel<00:00:55.140> it's<00:00:55.289> pretty<00:00:55.500> well

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
guess either his steel it's pretty well

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.520 
guess either his steel it's pretty well
but<00:00:57.030> actually<00:00:57.329> max<00:00:57.840> physical<00:00:58.289> defense

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
but actually max physical defense

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.380 
but actually max physical defense
steelix<00:00:58.949> takes<00:00:59.520> it<00:00:59.670> better<00:00:59.910> than<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.120> thought

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
steelix takes it better than I thought

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.270 
steelix takes it better than I thought
it<00:01:00.449> would<00:01:00.660> I<00:01:00.989> mean<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.350> is<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.500> dragonite<00:01:02.100> in

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
it would I mean that is a dragonite in

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.240 
it would I mean that is a dragonite in
fairness<00:01:02.550> life<00:01:02.969> or<00:01:03.180> Dragonite<00:01:03.890> and<00:01:04.890> I<00:01:05.070> can

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
fairness life or Dragonite and I can

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.580 
fairness life or Dragonite and I can
take<00:01:05.430> what<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.909> fire<00:01:06.420> punch<00:01:06.689> plus<00:01:07.020> an<00:01:07.140> aqua<00:01:07.409> tail

I<00:02:22.910> think<00:02:23.910> the<00:02:24.000> addition<00:02:24.300> of<00:02:24.390> sticky<00:02:24.720> web

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
I think the addition of sticky web

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.350 
I think the addition of sticky web
definitely<00:02:25.709> gives<00:02:26.490> it<00:02:26.640> some<00:02:26.790> more<00:02:26.820> viability

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
definitely gives it some more viability

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.380 
definitely gives it some more viability

recommended the power hub sky attack

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.890 
recommended the power hub sky attack
which<00:04:59.740> actually<00:05:00.460> I<00:05:00.849> consider<00:05:01.360> doing<00:05:01.599> because

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
which actually I consider doing because

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.469 
which actually I consider doing because
in<00:05:02.650> a<00:05:02.800> lot<00:05:02.830> of<00:05:02.979> cases<00:05:03.190> probably<00:05:03.610> more<00:05:03.970> powerful

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 
in a lot of cases probably more powerful

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:06.680 
in a lot of cases probably more powerful
than<00:05:04.630> a<00:05:04.750> super<00:05:05.050> effective<00:05:05.320> fling<00:05:05.770> but<00:05:06.039> like<00:05:06.280> I

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
than a super effective fling but like I

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.730 
than a super effective fling but like I
don't<00:05:07.690> know<00:05:07.840> I<00:05:07.900> think<00:05:08.050> I<00:05:08.229> kept<00:05:08.440> it<00:05:08.560> there<00:05:08.680> for

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
don't know I think I kept it there for

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.290 
don't know I think I kept it there for
like<00:05:08.979> a<00:05:09.159> gas<00:05:09.190> lash<00:05:09.610> and<00:05:09.880> stuff<00:05:10.090> like<00:05:10.240> that

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
like a gas lash and stuff like that

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.649 
like a gas lash and stuff like that
where<00:05:10.840> fling<00:05:11.199> would<00:05:11.380> come<00:05:11.560> in<00:05:11.680> handy<00:05:11.710> and<00:05:12.659> you

00:05:13.649 --> 00:05:13.659 
where fling would come in handy and you

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:16.439 
where fling would come in handy and you
know<00:05:13.780> the<00:05:14.020> dread<00:05:14.289> play<00:05:14.560> and<00:05:14.860> the<00:05:15.010> higher<00:05:15.909> I

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:16.449 
know the dread play and the higher I

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:19.980 
know the dread play and the higher I
think<00:05:17.199> it's<00:05:17.289> 90<00:05:17.650> base<00:05:17.800> power<00:05:18.070> plus<00:05:18.490> the<00:05:18.990> dark

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:19.990 
think it's 90 base power plus the dark

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.710 
think it's 90 base power plus the dark
boost<00:05:20.620> from<00:05:20.860> the<00:05:21.010> dread<00:05:21.220> play<00:05:21.400> itself<00:05:21.789> you

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 
boost from the dread play itself you

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.300 
boost from the dread play itself you
know<00:05:22.810> it<00:05:23.020> could<00:05:23.199> be<00:05:23.320> more<00:05:23.440> powerful<00:05:23.680> I<00:05:24.039> don't

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
know it could be more powerful I don't

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.270 
know it could be more powerful I don't
know<00:05:24.930> anyway<00:05:25.930> it<00:05:25.990> comes<00:05:26.169> with<00:05:26.320> it<00:05:26.470> so<00:05:26.650> I<00:05:26.919> take

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 
know anyway it comes with it so I take

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.670 
know anyway it comes with it so I take
out<00:05:27.400> the<00:05:27.490> greninja<00:05:27.789> because<00:05:28.300> obviously<00:05:29.169> I<00:05:29.440> was

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
out the greninja because obviously I was

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.680 
out the greninja because obviously I was
faster<00:05:30.039> off<00:05:30.159> the<00:05:30.190> unburden<00:05:30.820> now<00:05:31.419> this<00:05:31.659> thing

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:31.690 
faster off the unburden now this thing

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:33.570 
faster off the unburden now this thing
comes<00:05:32.080> in<00:05:32.259> I<00:05:32.470> actually<00:05:32.650> didn't<00:05:33.009> realize<00:05:33.310> this

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580 
comes in I actually didn't realize this

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.360 
comes in I actually didn't realize this
but<00:05:33.690> I'm<00:05:34.690> burden<00:05:35.139> like<00:05:35.650> the<00:05:35.770> speed<00:05:35.979> booster<00:05:36.250> on

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
but I'm burden like the speed booster on

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:37.860 
but I'm burden like the speed booster on
burden<00:05:36.699> doesn't<00:05:37.000> count<00:05:37.120> as<00:05:37.270> a<00:05:37.330> proper<00:05:37.690> speed

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
burden doesn't count as a proper speed

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.600 
burden doesn't count as a proper speed
boost<00:05:38.080> obviously<00:05:38.530> so<00:05:38.800> diff<00:05:39.430> though<00:05:39.550> it

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 
boost obviously so diff though it

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.610 
boost obviously so diff though it
doesn't<00:05:39.820> copy<00:05:40.180> that<00:05:40.479> I<00:05:40.720> wasn't<00:05:41.380> actually<00:05:41.440> sure

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
doesn't copy that I wasn't actually sure

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.730 
doesn't copy that I wasn't actually sure
if<00:05:41.800> that<00:05:42.039> would<00:05:42.130> be<00:05:42.340> a<00:05:42.550> thing<00:05:42.880> or<00:05:43.030> not<00:05:43.180> but<00:05:43.740> yeah

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
if that would be a thing or not but yeah

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.279 
if that would be a thing or not but yeah
it<00:05:44.860> turns<00:05:45.039> out<00:05:45.159> it's<00:05:45.340> not<00:05:45.550> sao<00:05:46.210> paulo<00:05:46.810> chair<00:05:47.139> is

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:47.289 
it turns out it's not sao paulo chair is

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:51.120 
it turns out it's not sao paulo chair is
