a<00:01:15.900> year<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.320> half<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.680> guess<00:01:16.890> because<00:01:17.070> we

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
a year and a half I guess because we

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.980 
a year and a half I guess because we
were<00:01:17.400> there<00:01:17.580> for<00:01:17.610> two<00:01:18.180> summers<00:01:18.450> in<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.780> winter

in<00:03:47.780> there<00:03:47.930> were<00:03:48.019> Chuck<00:03:48.260> because<00:03:49.100> I<00:03:49.280> believe

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
in there were Chuck because I believe

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:50.620 
in there were Chuck because I believe
that's<00:03:49.730> the<00:03:49.880> whole<00:03:50.090> reason<00:03:50.120> why<00:03:50.569> the

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:50.630 
that's the whole reason why the

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.599 
that's the whole reason why the
organization<00:03:51.380> brought<00:03:51.530> him<00:03:51.739> in<00:03:51.920> and<00:03:52.069> so<00:03:52.370> that

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:52.609 
organization brought him in and so that

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:55.449 
organization brought him in and so that
rematch<00:03:53.030> up<00:03:53.269> ya<00:03:53.690> know<00:03:53.989> you<00:03:54.680> know<00:03:54.829> I<00:03:54.859> but<00:03:55.430> I

rematch up ya know you know I but I

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.069 
rematch up ya know you know I but I
think<00:03:55.760> I<00:03:55.880> think<00:03:56.209> he's<00:03:56.329> gonna<00:03:56.480> if<00:03:56.750> he<00:03:56.900> was

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.079 
think I think he's gonna if he was

00:03:57.079 --> 00:03:58.629 
think I think he's gonna if he was
jittery<00:03:57.470> or<00:03:57.650> nervous<00:03:58.100> or<00:03:58.220> whatever<00:03:58.519> the

00:03:58.629 --> 00:03:58.639 
jittery or nervous or whatever the

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:00.129 
jittery or nervous or whatever the
reason<00:03:58.940> was<00:03:59.060> that<00:03:59.120> he<00:03:59.269> was<00:03:59.450> offered<00:03:59.750> mark<00:03:59.989> that

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:00.139 
reason was that he was offered mark that

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:01.809 
reason was that he was offered mark that
night<00:04:00.290> I<00:04:00.319> think<00:04:00.440> that<00:04:00.769> filling<00:04:01.400> up<00:04:01.489> working
