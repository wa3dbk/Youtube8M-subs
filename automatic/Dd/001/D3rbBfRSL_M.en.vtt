00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:18.200
 I was seven years old and I was seven years old 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:24.440
 I called at the fair 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:27.500
 then it was a very unique girl of dad 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:30.980
 and mom really I have not asked 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.140
 nothing of that because they are not 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:38.130
 the bad news because they gave me nothing 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:42.770
 but the Christian thing and came and 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.770
 nothing else they are christ 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.260
 and what are 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.140
 but have God and everything and attend English 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.270
 and thing 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.670
 at the same time one that is going to think that one 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.190
 things will happen with one 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.590
 what gets me from itself and in it 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.020
 I was at that moment in 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:05.239
 with their children but with their grandchildren and that 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.710
 but somewhere else on Sundays 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:09.200
 use for that for recreation for 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.479
 take them childhood when the 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.010
 news is that smell was like seeing not 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.570
 do on beaches or the village found out 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.310
 once that it was burning very 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.320
 It was the bus that brought the children of the cult 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.390
 as one says of the cult 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.940
 and me but when she learned when 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.890
 she wanted to arrive by motorcycle and the son 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.020
 She did not reach it because the 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.060
 son came and he went back and said no 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.250
 It's terrible, there's nothing like that 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.770
 realize that you can not neglect 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.780
 anyone who was not negligence by 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.480
 example fireman and nothing simply no longer 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.820
 you could do anything that was a matter of 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.940
 seconds went on and nobody could do 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.200
 nothing with these children they are like 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.450
 community mothers 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.939
 poor neighborhoods not necessarily from 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:55.570
 community mothers but poor neighborhoods 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:58.450
 who have been born have developed from 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.640
 that side of the railway where it passes 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.610
 the railroad or the outskirts of 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.049
 town but neighborhoods that correspond 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.360
 to foundation that are neighborhoods of the town 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.459

 villages that are neighborhoods of the town of 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.360
 foundation so that by means of 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.730
 local and national communication 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.400
