following<00:02:01.770> steps<00:02:02.100> need<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.399> be<00:02:02.520> taken<00:02:02.780> step

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
following steps need to be taken step

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.660 
following steps need to be taken step
one<00:02:04.049> is<00:02:04.350> to<00:02:04.560> turn<00:02:04.770> off<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:05.100> coffee<00:02:05.280> machine

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
one is to turn off the coffee machine

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.660 
one is to turn off the coffee machine
step<00:02:06.600> two<00:02:06.869> is<00:02:07.079> to<00:02:07.140> get<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:07.710> 10<00:02:08.009> liter<00:02:08.129> container

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
step two is to get a 10 liter container

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.999 
step two is to get a 10 liter container
for<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:08.970> waste<00:02:09.239> water<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.780> half<00:02:10.379> a<00:02:10.530> kilo<00:02:10.770> of

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
for the waste water and half a kilo of

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.530 
for the waste water and half a kilo of
dishwasher<00:02:11.430> salt

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
dishwasher salt

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.899 
dishwasher salt
the<00:02:13.170> amount<00:02:13.409> of<00:02:13.500> salt<00:02:13.709> needs<00:02:14.040> will<00:02:14.370> depend<00:02:14.730> on

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:14.909 
the amount of salt needs will depend on

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:17.210 
the amount of salt needs will depend on
the<00:02:15.030> size<00:02:15.209> of<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.629> ion<00:02:15.780> exchanger<00:02:16.319> unit<00:02:17.099> that

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
the size of the ion exchanger unit that

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.880 
the size of the ion exchanger unit that
you<00:02:17.370> have<00:02:17.549> this<00:02:18.480> is<00:02:18.689> a<00:02:18.720> five<00:02:18.989> liter<00:02:19.200> unit<00:02:19.650> so

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
you have this is a five liter unit so

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.380 
you have this is a five liter unit so
half<00:02:20.159> a<00:02:20.280> kilo<00:02:20.459> is<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.819> correct<00:02:21.060> amount<00:02:21.299> of

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
half a kilo is the correct amount of

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.679 
half a kilo is the correct amount of
salt<00:02:22.069> step<00:02:23.069> three<00:02:23.430> is<00:02:23.640> to<00:02:23.670> turn<00:02:24.150> off<00:02:24.450> the

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:24.689 
salt step three is to turn off the

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:26.869 
salt step three is to turn off the
incoming<00:02:25.200> water<00:02:25.379> this<00:02:26.099> is<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.370> tap<00:02:26.610> at<00:02:26.819> the
