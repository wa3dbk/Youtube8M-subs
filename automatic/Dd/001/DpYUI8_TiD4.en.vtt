Shimano Deore XT disc brake as an

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.050 
Shimano Deore XT disc brake as an
example<00:00:24.419> so<00:00:25.419> that<00:00:25.919> how<00:00:26.919> the<00:00:26.980> pad<00:00:27.339> is<00:00:27.609> retained

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.060 
example so that how the pad is retained

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.050 
example so that how the pad is retained
inside<00:00:28.359> the<00:00:28.660> caliper<00:00:29.109> and<00:00:29.140> how<00:00:29.529> the<00:00:30.220> pad<00:00:30.429> exits

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.060 
inside the caliper and how the pad exits

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.609 
inside the caliper and how the pad exits
the<00:00:31.179> caliper<00:00:31.599> be<00:00:31.810> it<00:00:31.900> either<00:00:32.050> through<00:00:32.320> the<00:00:32.380> top

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
the caliper be it either through the top

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:34.680 
the caliper be it either through the top
or<00:00:32.890> through<00:00:33.340> the<00:00:33.430> bottom<00:00:33.760> is<00:00:33.910> going<00:00:34.450> to<00:00:34.510> change

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
or through the bottom is going to change

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.900 
or through the bottom is going to change
a<00:00:34.840> little<00:00:34.930> bit<00:00:35.110> from<00:00:35.170> brand<00:00:35.560> to<00:00:35.620> brand<00:00:35.850> but<00:00:36.850> the

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
a little bit from brand to brand but the

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:40.680 
a little bit from brand to brand but the
fundamentals<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:38.850> things<00:00:39.850> you<00:00:40.000> need<00:00:40.149> to<00:00:40.270> do<00:00:40.420> as

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
fundamentals of things you need to do as

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.930 
fundamentals of things you need to do as
you<00:00:40.930> change<00:00:41.140> the<00:00:41.230> pads<00:00:41.530> are<00:00:41.829> the<00:00:41.860> same<00:00:42.219> so

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
you change the pads are the same so

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:44.790 
you change the pads are the same so
there'll<00:00:43.660> be<00:00:43.690> a<00:00:43.809> you<00:00:44.350> know<00:00:44.440> if<00:00:44.530> you're<00:00:44.680> doing

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
there'll be a you know if you're doing

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.110 
there'll be a you know if you're doing
your<00:00:44.949> own<00:00:44.980> pads<00:00:45.250> you<00:00:45.430> may<00:00:45.550> run<00:00:45.699> into<00:00:45.760> a<00:00:45.940> couple

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
your own pads you may run into a couple

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.990 
your own pads you may run into a couple
of<00:00:46.300> different<00:00:46.570> things<00:00:46.600> as<00:00:47.079> far<00:00:47.140> as<00:00:47.379> the<00:00:48.000> pads

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
of different things as far as the pads

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.920 
of different things as far as the pads
dropping<00:00:49.390> out<00:00:49.480> of<00:00:49.510> the<00:00:49.570> bottom<00:00:49.809> of<00:00:49.870> the

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
dropping out of the bottom of the

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.220 
dropping out of the bottom of the
caliper<00:00:50.289> versus<00:00:51.219> the<00:00:51.340> top<00:00:51.519> on<00:00:51.730> these<00:00:51.940> but<00:00:52.329> the

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
caliper versus the top on these but the

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.040 
caliper versus the top on these but the
methodology<00:00:53.920> is<00:00:53.980> the<00:00:54.100> same<00:00:54.309> so<00:00:55.120> first<00:00:55.960> thing

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.050 
methodology is the same so first thing

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.569 
methodology is the same so first thing
you<00:00:56.109> want<00:00:56.289> to<00:00:56.320> do<00:00:56.440> is<00:00:56.649> get<00:00:56.920> the<00:00:57.039> wheel<00:00:57.219> out<00:00:57.460> of

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
you want to do is get the wheel out of

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:00.119 
you want to do is get the wheel out of
the<00:00:57.820> bite<00:00:58.000> and<00:00:58.350> so<00:00:59.350> you're<00:00:59.500> not<00:00:59.620> dealing<00:00:59.829> with

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
the bite and so you're not dealing with

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:01.740 
the bite and so you're not dealing with
all<00:01:00.280> that<00:01:00.820> and<00:01:00.969> the<00:01:01.030> rotors<00:01:01.300> not<00:01:01.480> in<00:01:01.629> between

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
all that and the rotors not in between

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.110 
all that and the rotors not in between
the<00:01:01.960> brake<00:01:02.109> pads<00:01:02.350> and<00:01:02.730> then<00:01:03.730> the<00:01:03.820> next<00:01:04.030> thing

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.120 
the brake pads and then the next thing

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.090 
the brake pads and then the next thing
you<00:01:04.239> want<00:01:04.390> to<00:01:04.420> do<00:01:04.510> is<00:01:04.629> remove<00:01:04.930> the<00:01:05.199> the<00:01:05.860> pin

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:06.100 
you want to do is remove the the pin

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.700 
you want to do is remove the the pin
that<00:01:06.280> holds<00:01:06.610> the<00:01:07.000> pads<00:01:07.420> in<00:01:07.600> place<00:01:07.660> on<00:01:08.200> this<00:01:08.500> one

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
that holds the pads in place on this one

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.510 
that holds the pads in place on this one
there's<00:01:09.250> a<00:01:09.310> small<00:01:09.580> clip<00:01:09.850> on<00:01:09.970> the<00:01:10.090> back<00:01:11.520> which

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
there's a small clip on the back which

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.940 
there's a small clip on the back which
comes<00:01:12.790> out<00:01:13.030> and<00:01:13.300> then<00:01:14.050> the<00:01:14.260> front<00:01:14.530> side<00:01:14.710> is<00:01:14.920> a

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
comes out and then the front side is a

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.310 
comes out and then the front side is a
three<00:01:15.220> millimeter<00:01:15.400> allen<00:01:15.850> bolt<00:01:18.990> just<00:01:19.990> remove

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:20.320 
three millimeter allen bolt just remove

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.690 
three millimeter allen bolt just remove
both<00:01:20.500> of<00:01:20.650> those<00:01:20.770> and<00:01:21.010> set<00:01:21.160> them<00:01:21.310> to<00:01:21.340> the<00:01:21.490> side

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
both of those and set them to the side

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.470 
both of those and set them to the side
because<00:01:21.820> you're<00:01:22.030> going<00:01:22.150> to<00:01:22.210> put<00:01:22.300> those<00:01:22.420> back

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:22.480 
because you're going to put those back

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
because you're going to put those back
in<00:01:22.900> at<00:01:23.260> the<00:01:23.530> end<00:01:23.860> to<00:01:24.580> get<00:01:24.670> the<00:01:24.790> pads<00:01:25.030> out<00:01:25.380> like<00:01:26.380> I

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
in at the end to get the pads out like I

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.930 
in at the end to get the pads out like I
said<00:01:26.710> some<00:01:26.980> exit<00:01:27.310> through<00:01:27.430> the<00:01:27.460> top<00:01:27.700> and

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
said some exit through the top and

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:28.980 
said some exit through the top and
sometimes<00:01:28.090> it<00:01:28.330> through<00:01:28.450> the<00:01:28.570> bottom<00:01:28.690> these

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
sometimes it through the bottom these

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.470 
sometimes it through the bottom these
come<00:01:29.170> out<00:01:29.230> of<00:01:29.350> the<00:01:29.410> top<00:01:29.590> so<00:01:30.250> you<00:01:30.790> can<00:01:30.970> just<00:01:31.240> if

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:31.480 
come out of the top so you can just if

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.970 
come out of the top so you can just if
you<00:01:31.600> want<00:01:31.810> to<00:01:31.870> stick<00:01:32.020> your<00:01:32.170> finger<00:01:32.500> in<00:01:32.740> there

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:32.980 
you want to stick your finger in there

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.350 
you want to stick your finger in there
and<00:01:33.040> get<00:01:33.220> them<00:01:33.280> started<00:01:33.550> you<00:01:33.820> can<00:01:33.940> press<00:01:34.180> them

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
and get them started you can press them

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.130 
and get them started you can press them
up<00:01:34.540> you<00:01:35.410> can<00:01:35.590> grab<00:01:35.770> the<00:01:35.950> top<00:01:36.330> and<00:01:37.330> slide<00:01:37.930> them

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
up you can grab the top and slide them

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.070 
up you can grab the top and slide them
out<00:01:38.760> changing<00:01:39.760> today<00:01:39.910> from<00:01:40.270> resin<00:01:40.690> brake<00:01:40.840> pads

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
out changing today from resin brake pads

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.080 
out changing today from resin brake pads
to<00:01:41.260> metal<00:01:41.590> brake<00:01:41.770> pads<00:01:42.040> so<00:01:42.700> not<00:01:42.880> really

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
to metal brake pads so not really

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.450 
to metal brake pads so not really
replacing<00:01:43.660> a<00:01:43.780> set<00:01:44.590> of<00:01:44.680> completely<00:01:45.100> worn-out

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
replacing a set of completely worn-out

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.930 
replacing a set of completely worn-out
pads<00:01:45.760> but<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:48.040> may<00:01:48.160> do<00:01:48.310> this<00:01:48.490> because<00:01:48.730> you

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
pads but you may do this because you

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:49.710 
pads but you may do this because you
want<00:01:48.970> to<00:01:49.120> change<00:01:49.330> the<00:01:49.450> braking

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
want to change the braking

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.240 
want to change the braking
characteristics<00:01:50.350> if<00:01:50.500> you<00:01:50.590> are<00:01:50.740> replacing

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
characteristics if you are replacing

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.100 
characteristics if you are replacing
worn<00:01:51.490> pads<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:54.130> should<00:01:54.400> be<00:01:54.520> okay<00:01:54.910> in<00:01:55.210> terms<00:01:55.750> of

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
worn pads you should be okay in terms of

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.680 
worn pads you should be okay in terms of
the<00:01:56.770> brakes<00:01:57.040> needing<00:01:57.460> to<00:01:57.760> be<00:01:57.880> bled<00:01:58.150> or<00:01:58.300> not<00:01:58.450> if

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
the brakes needing to be bled or not if

the brakes needing to be bled or not if
the<00:01:59.260> brakes<00:01:59.500> weren't<00:01:59.770> bled<00:02:00.130> when<00:02:00.850> you<00:02:00.970> had

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
the brakes weren't bled when you had

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.080 
the brakes weren't bled when you had
really<00:02:01.690> really<00:02:01.930> worn<00:02:02.230> pads<00:02:02.530> in<00:02:02.770> there<00:02:03.030> if<00:02:04.030> that

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
really really worn pads in there if that

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.660 
really really worn pads in there if that
was<00:02:04.480> done<00:02:04.720> then<00:02:05.350> you're<00:02:05.920> probably<00:02:06.130> going<00:02:06.610> to

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
was done then you're probably going to

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.219 
was done then you're probably going to
have<00:02:06.820> the<00:02:07.000> Pistons<00:02:07.420> pushed<00:02:07.660> out<00:02:07.840> far<00:02:08.110> enough

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
have the Pistons pushed out far enough

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.350 
have the Pistons pushed out far enough
that<00:02:08.530> the<00:02:08.649> new<00:02:08.800> pads<00:02:09.069> are<00:02:09.489> going<00:02:09.970> to<00:02:10.030> be<00:02:10.149> too

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
that the new pads are going to be too

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.530 
that the new pads are going to be too
too<00:02:10.780> narrow<00:02:11.050> when<00:02:11.650> you<00:02:11.680> put<00:02:11.920> them<00:02:12.069> in<00:02:12.540> we're

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
too narrow when you put them in we're

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.759 
too narrow when you put them in we're
working<00:02:13.810> on<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:14.019> assumption<00:02:14.319> though<00:02:14.560> that

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
working on the assumption though that

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:16.500 
working on the assumption though that
hasn't<00:02:15.010> been<00:02:15.189> done<00:02:15.400> and<00:02:15.700> that<00:02:16.150> you're<00:02:16.329> just

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
hasn't been done and that you're just

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.050 
hasn't been done and that you're just
replacing<00:02:16.689> a<00:02:16.989> set<00:02:17.170> of<00:02:17.290> warm<00:02:17.500> pads<00:02:17.739> that

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
replacing a set of warm pads that

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.119 
replacing a set of warm pads that
we're<00:02:19.540> bled<00:02:19.870> originally<00:02:20.530> when<00:02:20.709> the<00:02:20.860> when<00:02:21.099> the

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:21.129 
we're bled originally when the when the

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:22.860 
we're bled originally when the when the
brakes<00:02:21.370> were<00:02:21.520> brand-new<00:02:21.849> so<00:02:22.239> just<00:02:22.450> set<00:02:22.750> the

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
brakes were brand-new so just set the

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.170 
brakes were brand-new so just set the
old<00:02:23.019> pads<00:02:23.230> to<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:23.590> side<00:02:23.800> at<00:02:24.099> this<00:02:24.790> point<00:02:24.910> you

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
old pads to the side at this point you

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.600 
old pads to the side at this point you
want<00:02:25.360> to<00:02:25.420> press<00:02:25.660> the<00:02:25.900> pistons<00:02:26.379> in<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:27.250> caliper

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
want to press the pistons in the caliper

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.130 
want to press the pistons in the caliper
fully<00:02:28.480> back<00:02:28.780> into<00:02:29.410> their<00:02:29.560> seat<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:31.720> safest

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
fully back into their seat the safest

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.680 
fully back into their seat the safest
way<00:02:32.230> to<00:02:32.260> do<00:02:32.470> that<00:02:32.650> is<00:02:32.860> with<00:02:33.069> something<00:02:33.690> that's

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
way to do that is with something that's

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.300 
way to do that is with something that's
not<00:02:34.900> a<00:02:34.959> real<00:02:35.349> sharp<00:02:35.620> edge<00:02:35.769> so<00:02:35.800> you<00:02:36.040> don't<00:02:36.190> want

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
not a real sharp edge so you don't want

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.610 
not a real sharp edge so you don't want
use<00:02:36.430> a<00:02:36.519> screwdriver<00:02:36.880> or<00:02:37.300> a<00:02:37.690> wrench<00:02:38.050> I<00:02:38.319> usually

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
use a screwdriver or a wrench I usually

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.130 
use a screwdriver or a wrench I usually
use<00:02:38.739> a<00:02:38.769> tire<00:02:39.099> lever<00:02:39.450> plastic<00:02:40.450> tower<00:02:40.630> tire

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
use a tire lever plastic tower tire

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.710 
use a tire lever plastic tower tire
lever<00:02:41.349> looks<00:02:41.560> works<00:02:41.860> really<00:02:42.040> well<00:02:42.280> just<00:02:42.720> stick

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
lever looks works really well just stick

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.979 
lever looks works really well just stick
it<00:02:43.870> in<00:02:44.019> to<00:02:44.980> the<00:02:45.099> brake<00:02:45.310> caliper<00:02:45.819> and<00:02:46.000> push<00:02:46.780> the

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
it in to the brake caliper and push the

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.500 
it in to the brake caliper and push the
opposing<00:02:47.380> piston<00:02:47.769> to<00:02:47.890> the<00:02:47.980> side<00:02:48.299> it<00:02:49.299> will<00:02:49.420> only

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
opposing piston to the side it will only

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.080 
opposing piston to the side it will only
take<00:02:49.629> a<00:02:49.780> little<00:02:50.110> pressure<00:02:50.319> and<00:02:50.760> that<00:02:51.760> way<00:02:51.940> when

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
take a little pressure and that way when

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.059 
take a little pressure and that way when
you<00:02:52.180> drop<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:52.390> new<00:02:52.630> pads<00:02:52.900> in<00:02:53.170> they'll<00:02:53.620> be<00:02:53.739> open

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:54.069 
you drop the new pads in they'll be open

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.390 
you drop the new pads in they'll be open
as<00:02:54.220> wide<00:02:54.430> as<00:02:54.610> they<00:02:54.760> can<00:02:55.000> be<00:02:55.860> okay<00:02:56.860> so<00:02:56.920> you<00:02:57.130> push

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
as wide as they can be okay so you push

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.190 
as wide as they can be okay so you push
the<00:02:57.519> Pistons<00:02:57.819> back<00:02:57.970> in<00:02:58.239> to<00:02:58.569> the<00:02:58.660> caliper<00:02:58.959> and

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
the Pistons back in to the caliper and

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.069 
the Pistons back in to the caliper and
you<00:02:59.680> want<00:02:59.890> to<00:03:00.090> carefully<00:03:01.090> install<00:03:01.780> the<00:03:01.930> new

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
you want to carefully install the new

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:04.650 
you want to carefully install the new
pads<00:03:02.349> here's<00:03:02.950> the<00:03:03.040> trick<00:03:03.280> you<00:03:04.180> don't<00:03:04.360> want<00:03:04.569> to

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
pads here's the trick you don't want to

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.259 
pads here's the trick you don't want to
touch<00:03:04.780> the<00:03:04.989> braking<00:03:05.319> surface<00:03:05.470> of<00:03:06.010> the<00:03:06.160> pads<00:03:06.370> so

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
touch the braking surface of the pads so

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:08.130 
touch the braking surface of the pads so
you<00:03:07.360> want<00:03:07.480> to<00:03:07.540> get<00:03:07.599> the<00:03:07.720> oils<00:03:07.959> from<00:03:08.049> your

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
you want to get the oils from your

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.680 
you want to get the oils from your
finger<00:03:08.500> on<00:03:08.530> there<00:03:08.910> so<00:03:09.910> just<00:03:10.180> handle<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:10.510> pad

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
finger on there so just handle the pad

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:11.850 
finger on there so just handle the pad
so<00:03:10.870> that<00:03:10.900> you<00:03:11.079> don't<00:03:11.230> touch<00:03:11.380> the<00:03:11.440> braking

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
so that you don't touch the braking

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.830 
so that you don't touch the braking
surface<00:03:12.060> so<00:03:13.060> you<00:03:13.420> have<00:03:13.989> one<00:03:14.769> pad<00:03:15.599> the<00:03:16.599> pad

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
surface so you have one pad the pad

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.160 
surface so you have one pad the pad
retaining<00:03:17.410> clip<00:03:17.620> that<00:03:18.069> goes<00:03:18.099> between<00:03:18.459> the<00:03:18.670> two

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
retaining clip that goes between the two

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.460 
retaining clip that goes between the two
just<00:03:20.170> drop<00:03:20.410> it<00:03:20.560> on<00:03:20.650> there<00:03:20.890> and<00:03:22.350> then<00:03:23.350> the

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
just drop it on there and then the

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.080 
just drop it on there and then the
second<00:03:23.829> pad<00:03:24.930> goes<00:03:25.930> on<00:03:26.109> top<00:03:26.319> of<00:03:26.440> that<00:03:26.590> and<00:03:27.090> now

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
second pad goes on top of that and now

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.280 
second pad goes on top of that and now
you've<00:03:28.299> got<00:03:28.420> the<00:03:28.540> pad<00:03:28.720> retaining<00:03:29.109> clip

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
you've got the pad retaining clip

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.720 
you've got the pad retaining clip
between<00:03:29.440> them<00:03:29.769> and<00:03:30.069> you<00:03:30.220> can<00:03:30.340> just<00:03:30.370> squeeze

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
between them and you can just squeeze

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.300 
between them and you can just squeeze
them<00:03:30.850> together<00:03:31.000> and<00:03:31.480> drop<00:03:32.260> them<00:03:32.440> back<00:03:32.620> down

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
them together and drop them back down

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.920 
them together and drop them back down
into<00:03:33.489> the<00:03:33.639> caliper<00:03:34.060> that<00:03:36.540> it's<00:03:37.540> real<00:03:37.720> simple

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
into the caliper that it's real simple

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.960 
into the caliper that it's real simple
at<00:03:38.440> this<00:03:38.620> point<00:03:38.829> you<00:03:38.950> just<00:03:38.980> want<00:03:39.280> to<00:03:39.310> replace

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
at this point you just want to replace

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.009 
at this point you just want to replace
the<00:03:40.239> pin<00:03:40.630> that<00:03:40.780> holds<00:03:40.900> them<00:03:41.109> in<00:03:41.170> place<00:03:43.019> tighten

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
the pin that holds them in place tighten

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:48.690 
the pin that holds them in place tighten
that<00:03:44.200> back<00:03:44.380> down<00:03:45.510> and<00:03:47.280> then<00:03:48.280> put<00:03:48.400> the<00:03:48.489> safety

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
that back down and then put the safety

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:54.569 
that back down and then put the safety
clip<00:03:48.819> back<00:03:49.180> on<00:03:50.459> that<00:03:51.459> pad<00:03:51.700> holder<00:03:53.489> okay<00:03:54.489> at

clip back on that pad holder okay at

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:56.970 
clip back on that pad holder okay at
this<00:03:54.700> point<00:03:54.790> you've<00:03:55.150> got<00:03:55.180> new<00:03:55.420> pads<00:03:55.660> in<00:03:55.980> when

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
this point you've got new pads in when
