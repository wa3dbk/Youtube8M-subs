works<00:01:56.390> so<00:01:57.390> I'm<00:01:57.479> going<00:01:57.659> to<00:01:57.689> do<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:57.960> rough

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
works so I'm going to do a rough

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.380 
works so I'm going to do a rough
demonstration<00:01:59.280> here<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.759> actually<00:02:00.149> you're

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
demonstration here and actually you're

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.350 
demonstration here and actually you're
gonna<00:02:00.479> use<00:02:00.689> this<00:02:01.159> meat<00:02:02.159> thermometer<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.180> kind

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
gonna use this meat thermometer to kind

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.219 
gonna use this meat thermometer to kind
of<00:02:03.420> show<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:05.600> how<00:02:06.600> it<00:02:06.960> actually<00:02:07.079> works

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
of show you the how it actually works

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.139 
of show you the how it actually works
and<00:02:07.590> how<00:02:07.710> it<00:02:07.740> actually<00:02:08.009> cools<00:02:08.369> down<00:02:08.640> which<00:02:08.940> I

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
and how it actually cools down which I

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.639 
and how it actually cools down which I
don't<00:02:09.300> really<00:02:09.509> know<00:02:09.690> how<00:02:09.720> exactly<00:02:10.259> how<00:02:10.470> it

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
don't really know how exactly how it

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.430 
don't really know how exactly how it
does<00:02:10.770> it<00:02:10.979> I<00:02:11.160> think<00:02:11.730> it<00:02:11.819> has<00:02:12.000> some<00:02:12.360> type<00:02:12.660> of<00:02:12.690> ax

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
does it I think it has some type of ax

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.670 
does it I think it has some type of ax
material<00:02:13.830> that<00:02:13.980> it's<00:02:14.100> made<00:02:14.160> out<00:02:14.460> of<00:02:14.490> that

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
material that it's made out of that

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.200 
material that it's made out of that
controls<00:02:16.680> or<00:02:16.920> regulates<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.490> evaporation

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
controls or regulates the evaporation

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.330 
controls or regulates the evaporation
process<00:02:18.510> so<00:02:18.990> it<00:02:19.080> actually<00:02:19.230> will<00:02:19.620> cool<00:02:20.010> itself

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
process so it actually will cool itself

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.130 
process so it actually will cool itself
down<00:02:20.460> but<00:02:20.910> what<00:02:21.450> I'll<00:02:21.540> do<00:02:21.630> is<00:02:21.780> I'll<00:02:21.870> kind<00:02:22.110> of

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
down but what I'll do is I'll kind of

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.310 
down but what I'll do is I'll kind of
run<00:02:22.470> some<00:02:22.650> hot<00:02:22.800> water<00:02:23.030> and<00:02:24.030> get<00:02:24.810> it<00:02:24.930> absorbed

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
run some hot water and get it absorbed

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.860 
run some hot water and get it absorbed
with<00:02:25.440> a<00:02:25.470> lot<00:02:25.620> of<00:02:25.710> hot<00:02:25.800> water<00:02:26.150> again<00:02:27.150> snap<00:02:27.660> it

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
with a lot of hot water again snap it

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.210 
with a lot of hot water again snap it
and<00:02:28.050> I'll<00:02:28.230> kind<00:02:28.410> of<00:02:28.500> show<00:02:28.560> you<00:02:28.710> how<00:02:28.890> it<00:02:29.010> cools

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
and I'll kind of show you how it cools

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.400 
and I'll kind of show you how it cools
down<00:02:29.370> so<00:02:29.790> bear<00:02:30.360> with<00:02:30.390> me<00:02:30.690> on<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.930> camera<00:02:31.230> work

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
down so bear with me on the camera work

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:43.040 
down so bear with me on the camera work
here

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.520 

so<00:02:44.050> what<00:02:44.560> I<00:02:44.590> did<00:02:44.709> it<00:02:44.950> I<00:02:46.050> put<00:02:47.050> some<00:02:47.200> just<00:02:47.380> hot

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
so what I did it I put some just hot

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.949 
so what I did it I put some just hot
water<00:02:47.770> from<00:02:47.950> my<00:02:48.130> posit<00:02:48.610> here<00:02:48.819> and<00:02:49.030> I'll<00:02:49.780> kind

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
water from my posit here and I'll kind

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.070 
water from my posit here and I'll kind
of<00:02:50.080> put<00:02:50.260> the<00:02:51.180> temperature<00:02:52.180> gauge<00:02:52.390> up<00:02:52.720> so<00:02:52.990> you

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
of put the temperature gauge up so you

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.440 
of put the temperature gauge up so you
can<00:02:53.200> see<00:02:53.230> it<00:02:53.650> I<00:02:53.910> don't<00:02:54.910> know<00:02:55.000> how<00:02:55.180> lolli<00:02:55.330> can

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
can see it I don't know how lolli can

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.680 
can see it I don't know how lolli can
see<00:02:55.750> it<00:02:55.870> there<00:02:56.220> that's<00:02:57.220> the<00:02:57.520> right<00:02:57.700> way<00:02:57.970> but

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
see it there that's the right way but

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.960 
see it there that's the right way but
right<00:02:59.319> now<00:02:59.530> it's<00:02:59.800> at<00:03:00.250> about<00:03:00.489> 90<00:03:01.480> degrees<00:03:01.510> and

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
right now it's at about 90 degrees and

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.690 
right now it's at about 90 degrees and
the<00:03:03.970> towel<00:03:04.209> says<00:03:04.980> with<00:03:05.980> the<00:03:06.069> instructions<00:03:06.459> on

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
the towel says with the instructions on

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.650 
the towel says with the instructions on
the<00:03:06.790> towel<00:03:07.680> say<00:03:08.680> that<00:03:09.209> it'll<00:03:10.209> cool<00:03:10.330> down<00:03:10.390> to

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
the towel say that it'll cool down to

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.060 
the towel say that it'll cool down to
roughly<00:03:10.780> 60<00:03:11.230> degrees<00:03:11.530> so<00:03:11.680> it's<00:03:11.769> not<00:03:11.830> gonna<00:03:11.980> be

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:12.070 
roughly 60 degrees so it's not gonna be

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:13.949 
roughly 60 degrees so it's not gonna be
really<00:03:12.250> cold<00:03:12.640> but<00:03:12.940> it's<00:03:13.450> still<00:03:13.630> going<00:03:13.780> to<00:03:13.870> have

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
really cold but it's still going to have

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:15.840 
really cold but it's still going to have
a<00:03:14.019> cooling<00:03:14.290> sensation<00:03:14.560> so<00:03:15.190> do<00:03:15.580> you<00:03:15.610> can<00:03:15.730> see

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
a cooling sensation so do you can see

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.199 
a cooling sensation so do you can see
we're<00:03:16.150> right<00:03:16.300> about<00:03:16.540> at<00:03:16.690> 90<00:03:17.140> degrees<00:03:18.090> give<00:03:19.090> or

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
we're right about at 90 degrees give or

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.660 
we're right about at 90 degrees give or
take<00:03:19.390> there<00:03:19.720> and<00:03:19.959> so<00:03:20.769> what<00:03:21.310> I'm<00:03:21.400> going<00:03:21.489> to<00:03:21.550> do

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
take there and so what I'm going to do

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.540 
take there and so what I'm going to do
is<00:03:21.790> I<00:03:21.910> am<00:03:21.940> kind<00:03:22.269> of<00:03:22.300> bringing<00:03:22.510> out<00:03:22.660> some<00:03:22.870> more

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
is I am kind of bringing out some more

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.240 
is I am kind of bringing out some more
it's<00:03:24.550> in<00:03:24.670> that<00:03:24.790> excess<00:03:25.150> water<00:03:25.360> out<00:03:25.510> and<00:03:26.250> then

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
it's in that excess water out and then

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.490 
it's in that excess water out and then
again<00:03:28.000> with<00:03:28.150> a<00:03:28.269> truck<00:03:28.450> mistake<00:03:28.810> to<00:03:29.230> be<00:03:29.350> with

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
again with a truck mistake to be with

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.350 
again with a truck mistake to be with
snap<00:03:29.860> it<00:03:30.100> so<00:03:31.080> and<00:03:32.489> then<00:03:33.489> I<00:03:33.760> actually<00:03:34.030> kind<00:03:34.330> of

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
snap it so and then I actually kind of

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.670 
snap it so and then I actually kind of
fun<00:03:34.510> it<00:03:34.690> actually<00:03:35.050> works<00:03:35.200> better<00:03:35.260> to<00:03:35.500> kind<00:03:35.650> of

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
fun it actually works better to kind of

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.400 
fun it actually works better to kind of
like<00:03:35.830> waving<00:03:36.400> around<00:03:36.610> a<00:03:36.819> little<00:03:36.940> bit<00:03:37.150> and<00:03:38.050> you

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
like waving around a little bit and you

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.800 
like waving around a little bit and you
can<00:03:38.440> well<00:03:39.190> as<00:03:39.310> you<00:03:39.459> can't<00:03:39.880> see<00:03:40.090> but<00:03:40.300> I<00:03:40.450> can<00:03:40.510> kind

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
can well as you can't see but I can kind

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.509 
can well as you can't see but I can kind
of<00:03:40.900> start<00:03:41.260> to<00:03:41.410> feel<00:03:41.590> it<00:03:41.739> it's<00:03:42.070> cooling<00:03:42.489> down

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
of start to feel it it's cooling down

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.789 
of start to feel it it's cooling down
already<00:03:42.970> or<00:03:43.180> it's<00:03:43.329> getting<00:03:43.570> get<00:03:43.750> not<00:03:44.530> getting

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
already or it's getting get not getting

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:47.310 
already or it's getting get not getting
hot<00:03:45.010> so<00:03:45.250> I'm<00:03:45.459> going<00:03:45.610> to<00:03:45.640> wrap<00:03:45.820> this<00:03:46.030> up<00:03:46.320> again

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
hot so I'm going to wrap this up again

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.410 
hot so I'm going to wrap this up again
just<00:03:47.440> trying<00:03:47.650> to<00:03:47.709> get<00:03:47.860> another<00:03:48.420> temperature

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:49.420 
just trying to get another temperature

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.620 
just trying to get another temperature
reading<00:03:49.840> and<00:03:50.019> you<00:03:50.430> can<00:03:51.430> see<00:03:51.579> it<00:03:51.670> kind<00:03:51.880> of<00:03:52.390> is

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
reading and you can see it kind of is

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:58.370 
reading and you can see it kind of is
starting<00:03:53.110> to<00:03:55.200> to<00:03:56.200> come<00:03:56.410> down<00:03:56.620> in<00:03:56.920> temperature

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
starting to to come down in temperature

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.600 
starting to to come down in temperature
again<00:03:59.380> I<00:03:59.590> don't<00:03:59.799> know<00:03:59.890> how<00:04:00.070> well<00:04:00.280> you<00:04:00.430> can<00:04:00.549> see

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
again I don't know how well you can see

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.490 
again I don't know how well you can see
that<00:04:03.000> but<00:04:04.000> your<00:04:04.180> gauge<00:04:04.390> but<00:04:04.720> it<00:04:05.019> is<00:04:05.200> coming

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
that but your gauge but it is coming

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.610 
that but your gauge but it is coming
down<00:04:05.650> and<00:04:06.000> again<00:04:07.000> I<00:04:07.109> probably<00:04:08.109> have<00:04:08.290> to<00:04:08.320> trust

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
down and again I probably have to trust

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.099 
down and again I probably have to trust
me<00:04:08.799> more<00:04:08.829> than<00:04:09.100> anything<00:04:09.340> so<00:04:10.000> I've<00:04:10.959> actually

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
me more than anything so I've actually

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:12.840 
me more than anything so I've actually
taken<00:04:11.320> out<00:04:11.530> taking<00:04:12.190> this<00:04:12.250> out<00:04:12.400> on<00:04:12.430> a<00:04:12.549> couple<00:04:12.700> of

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
taken out taking this out on a couple of

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.509 
taken out taking this out on a couple of
runs<00:04:13.060> and<00:04:13.329> has<00:04:13.989> been<00:04:14.170> extremely<00:04:15.010> warm<00:04:15.370> out

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 
runs and has been extremely warm out

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:17.490 
runs and has been extremely warm out
here<00:04:15.549> in<00:04:15.880> Minnesota<00:04:16.269> so<00:04:16.630> plenty<00:04:17.410> of

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
here in Minnesota so plenty of

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.009 
here in Minnesota so plenty of
opportunities<00:04:17.890> to<00:04:17.919> kind<00:04:18.160> of<00:04:18.190> test<00:04:18.430> it<00:04:18.669> and<00:04:19.019> I

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
opportunities to kind of test it and I

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.020 
opportunities to kind of test it and I
would<00:04:20.109> say<00:04:20.590> that<00:04:20.620> it<00:04:21.070> does<00:04:21.130> work<00:04:21.700> really<00:04:21.729> well

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
would say that it does work really well

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.960 
would say that it does work really well
it<00:04:22.479> does<00:04:22.900> have<00:04:23.280> some<00:04:24.280> of<00:04:24.370> that<00:04:24.490> cooling

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
it does have some of that cooling

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.810 
it does have some of that cooling
sensation<00:04:25.180> it<00:04:25.690> almost<00:04:25.930> feels<00:04:26.260> like<00:04:26.640> when<00:04:27.640> you

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
sensation it almost feels like when you

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.730 
sensation it almost feels like when you
are<00:04:28.180> sleeping<00:04:28.570> and<00:04:28.990> you<00:04:29.080> thought<00:04:29.260> your<00:04:29.440> kelo

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
are sleeping and you thought your kelo

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.740 
are sleeping and you thought your kelo
over<00:04:30.100> and<00:04:30.340> the<00:04:30.490> other<00:04:30.700> side<00:04:30.970> of<00:04:31.000> nice<00:04:31.360> and<00:04:31.539> cool

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
over and the other side of nice and cool

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.010 
over and the other side of nice and cool
has<00:04:31.990> that<00:04:32.169> type<00:04:32.380> of<00:04:32.410> feel<00:04:32.740> to<00:04:32.800> it<00:04:33.060> and<00:04:34.060> it's

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
has that type of feel to it and it's

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.600 
has that type of feel to it and it's
pretty<00:04:35.200> instantaneous<00:04:35.590> like<00:04:35.950> I<00:04:36.039> can<00:04:36.220> feel<00:04:36.430> it

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
pretty instantaneous like I can feel it

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.630 
pretty instantaneous like I can feel it
now<00:04:36.789> it<00:04:37.000> had<00:04:37.360> that<00:04:37.510> kind<00:04:37.690> of<00:04:37.720> cool<00:04:38.020> feel<00:04:38.320> to<00:04:38.560> it

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640 
now it had that kind of cool feel to it

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.740 
now it had that kind of cool feel to it
and<00:04:39.640> as<00:04:40.000> nice<00:04:40.180> as<00:04:40.240> you<00:04:40.330> can<00:04:40.450> actually<00:04:40.510> just

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
and as nice as you can actually just

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.800 
and as nice as you can actually just
wrap<00:04:40.960> it<00:04:40.990> around<00:04:41.229> your<00:04:41.890> neck<00:04:41.950> and<00:04:42.400> kind<00:04:43.240> of<00:04:43.300> put

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
wrap it around your neck and kind of put

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.029 
wrap it around your neck and kind of put
it<00:04:43.900> under<00:04:44.080> your<00:04:44.110> shirt<00:04:44.410> and<00:04:44.620> this<00:04:44.800> type<00:04:45.010> of

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:45.039 
it under your shirt and this type of

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:46.860 
it under your shirt and this type of
thing<00:04:45.340> or<00:04:45.610> even<00:04:46.030> drape<00:04:46.210> it<00:04:46.330> over<00:04:46.419> your<00:04:46.539> head

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
thing or even drape it over your head

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.550 
thing or even drape it over your head
and<00:04:47.280> it<00:04:48.280> does<00:04:48.430> work<00:04:48.460> really<00:04:48.729> well<00:04:49.000> the

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
and it does work really well the

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.010 
and it does work really well the
kind<00:04:50.800> of<00:04:50.860> the<00:04:50.950> drawbacks<00:04:51.220> on<00:04:51.730> it<00:04:51.910> is<00:04:52.150> that<00:04:52.389> it's

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
kind of the drawbacks on it is that it's

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.510 
kind of the drawbacks on it is that it's
a<00:04:53.169> really<00:04:53.350> thin<00:04:53.560> material<00:04:54.010> so<00:04:54.160> once<00:04:54.340> you<00:04:54.430> have

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
a really thin material so once you have

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.240 
a really thin material so once you have
on<00:04:54.730> your<00:04:54.850> skin<00:04:55.150> for<00:04:55.450> maiden<00:04:56.350> or<00:04:56.500> two<00:04:56.680> it'll

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
on your skin for maiden or two it'll

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.610 
on your skin for maiden or two it'll
start<00:04:57.610> to<00:04:57.639> get<00:04:57.850> warm<00:04:58.180> again<00:04:58.419> just<00:04:59.169> from<00:04:59.350> being

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
start to get warm again just from being

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.920 
start to get warm again just from being
in<00:04:59.800> contact<00:04:59.980> with<00:05:00.340> your<00:05:00.430> skin<00:05:00.490> and<00:05:00.940> it<00:05:01.690> being

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
in contact with your skin and it being

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:04.440 
in contact with your skin and it being
such<00:05:02.169> a<00:05:02.200> thin<00:05:02.440> material<00:05:02.950> so<00:05:03.910> you<00:05:03.970> kind<00:05:04.210> of<00:05:04.270> have

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450 
such a thin material so you kind of have

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:07.350 
such a thin material so you kind of have
to<00:05:04.480> you<00:05:05.020> know<00:05:05.139> snap<00:05:05.470> it<00:05:05.680> or<00:05:05.800> kind<00:05:06.639> of<00:05:06.730> get<00:05:07.240> it

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
to you know snap it or kind of get it

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.860 
to you know snap it or kind of get it
cool<00:05:08.050> down<00:05:08.110> again<00:05:08.650> so<00:05:08.770> if<00:05:08.860> you<00:05:08.950> stab<00:05:09.280> it<00:05:09.430> again

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
cool down again so if you stab it again

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.930 
cool down again so if you stab it again
it'll<00:05:10.870> start<00:05:11.169> to<00:05:11.200> cool<00:05:11.440> down<00:05:11.500> after<00:05:12.430> its<00:05:12.760> come

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
it'll start to cool down after its come

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.670 
it'll start to cool down after its come
been<00:05:13.240> on<00:05:13.450> your<00:05:13.720> on<00:05:13.900> your<00:05:13.930> skin<00:05:14.350> or<00:05:14.380> on<00:05:14.590> your

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
been on your on your skin or on your

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:19.080 
been on your on your skin or on your
body<00:05:14.919> so<00:05:15.360> um<00:05:16.360> I<00:05:16.450> mean<00:05:17.320> I<00:05:17.470> also<00:05:17.980> found<00:05:18.280> when<00:05:19.060> I

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
body so um I mean I also found when I

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.629 
body so um I mean I also found when I
was<00:05:19.270> ours<00:05:19.480> and<00:05:20.110> it<00:05:20.260> was<00:05:20.350> really<00:05:20.530> humid<00:05:21.010> that<00:05:21.430> it

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:21.639 
was ours and it was really humid that it

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:23.640 
was ours and it was really humid that it
didn't<00:05:21.940> really<00:05:22.060> have<00:05:22.330> as<00:05:22.540> much<00:05:22.960> of<00:05:23.139> a<00:05:23.229> cooling

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:23.650 
didn't really have as much of a cooling

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:25.800 
didn't really have as much of a cooling
effect<00:05:23.740> when<00:05:24.490> I<00:05:24.520> was<00:05:24.729> out<00:05:24.880> just<00:05:25.540> running

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:25.810 
effect when I was out just running

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.710 
effect when I was out just running
around<00:05:26.020> and<00:05:26.500> so<00:05:27.070> it<00:05:27.430> works<00:05:28.030> alright<00:05:28.570> I<00:05:28.600> think

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 
around and so it works alright I think

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.350 
around and so it works alright I think
it<00:05:29.020> would<00:05:29.139> be<00:05:29.290> a<00:05:29.320> much<00:05:29.680> better<00:05:29.740> application

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
it would be a much better application

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.020 
it would be a much better application
for<00:05:31.360> a<00:05:31.919> basketball<00:05:32.919> baseball<00:05:33.430> we're<00:05:33.910> actually

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:34.030 
for a basketball baseball we're actually

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.420 
for a basketball baseball we're actually
just<00:05:34.240> sitting<00:05:34.570> down<00:05:34.889> especially<00:05:35.889> if<00:05:36.280> you're

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:36.430 
just sitting down especially if you're

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.480 
just sitting down especially if you're
gonna<00:05:36.550> endure<00:05:37.540> type<00:05:38.260> of<00:05:38.440> environment<00:05:39.340> where

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
gonna endure type of environment where

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.100 
gonna endure type of environment where
there's<00:05:39.669> not<00:05:39.760> a<00:05:39.820> lot<00:05:39.970> of<00:05:40.000> humidity<00:05:40.300> humidity

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
there's not a lot of humidity humidity

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.129 
there's not a lot of humidity humidity
seems<00:05:41.710> to<00:05:42.030> make<00:05:43.030> the<00:05:43.210> towel<00:05:43.389> the<00:05:43.960> less

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:44.139 
seems to make the towel the less

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:46.379 
seems to make the towel the less
effective<00:05:44.620> from<00:05:44.830> from<00:05:45.340> a<00:05:45.460> cooling<00:05:45.850> standpoint

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:46.389 
effective from from a cooling standpoint

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:49.620 
effective from from a cooling standpoint
but<00:05:47.220> it<00:05:48.220> is<00:05:48.340> a<00:05:48.370> really<00:05:48.580> cool<00:05:48.760> product<00:05:49.060> and<00:05:49.389> I

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:49.630 
but it is a really cool product and I

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.520 
but it is a really cool product and I
think<00:05:49.870> that<00:05:50.350> if<00:05:50.680> you're<00:05:50.979> out<00:05:51.400> on<00:05:51.460> the<00:05:51.639> run<00:05:51.880> and

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530 
think that if you're out on the run and

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.170 
think that if you're out on the run and
need<00:05:53.530> something<00:05:53.830> as<00:05:54.190> far<00:05:54.460> as<00:05:54.490> for<00:05:54.760> cooling<00:05:55.120> I

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
need something as far as for cooling I

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.820 
need something as far as for cooling I
think<00:05:55.360> this<00:05:55.450> is<00:05:55.570> a<00:05:55.600> kind<00:05:56.200> of<00:05:56.289> a<00:05:56.380> cool<00:05:56.530> product

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:56.830 
think this is a kind of a cool product

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.380 
think this is a kind of a cool product
to<00:05:56.979> maybe<00:05:57.130> try<00:05:57.400> out<00:05:57.610> and<00:05:57.850> again<00:05:58.090> it's<00:05:58.240> only

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:58.390 
to maybe try out and again it's only

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:01.170 
to maybe try out and again it's only
fifteen<00:05:58.720> dollars<00:05:59.080> so<00:06:00.000> i'll<00:06:01.000> do<00:06:01.120> another

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.180 
fifteen dollars so i'll do another

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.940 
fifteen dollars so i'll do another
reading<00:06:01.840> your<00:06:02.080> excel<00:06:02.380> it's<00:06:02.500> getting<00:06:02.710> kind<00:06:02.860> of

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:02.950 
reading your excel it's getting kind of

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:05.909 
reading your excel it's getting kind of
cool<00:06:03.390> or<00:06:04.390> fairly<00:06:04.570> cool<00:06:04.930> so<00:06:05.229> as<00:06:05.440> you<00:06:05.590> can<00:06:05.680> see

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:05.919 
cool or fairly cool so as you can see

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:09.480 
cool or fairly cool so as you can see
the<00:06:06.250> temperature<00:06:07.060> on<00:06:07.180> here<00:06:07.390> now<00:06:07.570> is<00:06:07.810> i<00:06:08.490> think

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.490 
the temperature on here now is i think

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:13.400 
the temperature on here now is i think
it's<00:06:09.610> around<00:06:09.700> 80<00:06:10.030> degrees<00:06:10.180> just<00:06:10.750> under<00:06:11.380> 80<00:06:11.650> so

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:13.410 
it's around 80 degrees just under 80 so

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.779 
it's around 80 degrees just under 80 so
i'll<00:06:14.410> try<00:06:14.590> to<00:06:14.650> wrap<00:06:14.830> it<00:06:14.979> up<00:06:15.070> here<00:06:15.100> again<00:06:15.400> so<00:06:15.700> you

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:15.789 
i'll try to wrap it up here again so you

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:19.379 
i'll try to wrap it up here again so you
can<00:06:15.820> move<00:06:16.030> down<00:06:16.300> but<00:06:17.669> the<00:06:18.669> the<00:06:19.090> project

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:19.389 
can move down but the the project

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:20.850 
can move down but the the project
overall<00:06:19.630> is<00:06:19.750> really<00:06:19.960> cool<00:06:20.139> and<00:06:20.320> I<00:06:20.620> think<00:06:20.770> it

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:20.860 
overall is really cool and I think it

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.640 
overall is really cool and I think it
does<00:06:20.979> have<00:06:21.190> some<00:06:21.760> benefits<00:06:22.450> for<00:06:22.960> for<00:06:23.350> running

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:23.650 
does have some benefits for for running

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.529 
does have some benefits for for running
events<00:06:24.010> obviously<00:06:24.610> you're<00:06:24.789> running<00:06:25.419> really

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:25.539 
events obviously you're running really

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:29.040 
events obviously you're running really
fast<00:06:26.070> it's<00:06:27.070> not<00:06:27.280> great<00:06:27.729> to<00:06:27.880> have<00:06:28.030> caring<00:06:28.960> at

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.050 
fast it's not great to have caring at

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.100 
fast it's not great to have caring at
all<00:06:29.200> around<00:06:29.760> but<00:06:30.760> for<00:06:31.000> some<00:06:31.330> alter<00:06:31.600> events<00:06:31.720> or

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.110 
all around but for some alter events or

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:33.950 
all around but for some alter events or
just<00:06:32.320> when<00:06:32.530> you're<00:06:32.650> all<00:06:32.740> training<00:06:33.010> and<00:06:33.280> you

00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:33.960 
just when you're all training and you

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.210 
just when you're all training and you
want<00:06:34.960> to<00:06:35.020> stay<00:06:35.200> cool<00:06:35.440> i<00:06:35.500> think<00:06:35.740> this<00:06:35.830> is<00:06:35.950> a<00:06:35.979> kind

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:36.220 
want to stay cool i think this is a kind

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:39.120 
want to stay cool i think this is a kind
of<00:06:36.310> a<00:06:36.430> good<00:06:36.660> option<00:06:37.660> to<00:06:38.050> maybe<00:06:38.130> experiment

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:39.130 
of a good option to maybe experiment

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:40.290 
of a good option to maybe experiment
with<00:06:39.340> and<00:06:39.370> it<00:06:39.669> see<00:06:39.850> if<00:06:39.910> it's<00:06:40.060> going<00:06:40.150> to<00:06:40.210> work

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:40.300 
with and it see if it's going to work

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.000 
with and it see if it's going to work
for<00:06:40.419> you<00:06:40.690> and<00:06:41.080> it's<00:06:41.500> just<00:06:41.620> kind<00:06:41.740> of<00:06:41.770> a<00:06:41.889> cool

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.010 
for you and it's just kind of a cool

product it in general and again fifteen

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.879 
product it in general and again fifteen
dollars<00:06:45.400> so<00:06:45.639> maybe<00:06:46.330> worth<00:06:46.600> the<00:06:46.900> investment<00:06:47.530> to

00:06:47.879 --> 00:06:47.889 
dollars so maybe worth the investment to

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:50.990
