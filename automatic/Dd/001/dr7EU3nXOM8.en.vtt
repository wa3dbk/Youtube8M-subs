00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:06.180
 hello today I want you times 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.930
 like ton ochs kadett and the cobox bantam 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.210
 imagine 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.530
 both from the alos series that is the 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.660
 handles are made of aluminum 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.519
 Unfortunately, victorinox offers only a small one 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.410
 selection of its diameter with alu attacked 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.930
 if I have the choice I grab 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.400
 actually always to these models 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:23.160
 First, I like the visual better 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.810
 secondly, all the handles are fluted and therewith 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.800
 it is much more handy from plastic 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.390
 and third , they are more robust at two 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.859
 men have victorinox knives themselves 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.579
 After a few years the handles are minimal 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.829
 forbidden 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.239
 that is not bad but at 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.870
 Of course , that can not be attacked 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.059
 happen 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.290
 and last but not least the fair in alu 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.290
 grabbed a bit narrower 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:50.370
 The quartet has a sword one 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.350
 Can opener my little 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:58.230
 screwdriver a bottle opener in 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.190
 a big screwdriver and a 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.629
 nail file both the can opener as 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.470
 I also only need the bottle opener 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.479
 quite rare 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.909
 yet it is practically both to play in 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.970
 on the other hand could have on the nail file 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.229
 I personally do without on the way 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.000
 the big screwdriver it very much 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.450
 handy and can also be used 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.119
 levers use the small ones 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.439
 I do not think so useful consumption 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.909
 I quite occasionally on the way 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.500
 a small screwdriver 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.970
 however, the small screws are in 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.920
 many cases offset something down 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.540
 so I with the screwdriver of 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.540
 cadets get screwed on me 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.229
 pay sticks and tweezers are at the 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.740
 model with attacks basically not 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.740
 available 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.820
 I have the cadet before about two 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.600
 Years have brought it as an idea to them 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.280
 use 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.930
 I have also done that for a while 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.960
 and then at some point 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.380
 the reason for that was the weight is with 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.259
 a length of 82 centimeters 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.030
 then we would have from 25 cm wide of 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.149
 eight millimeters and a weight of 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.950
 46 g20 nice and small and handy 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.360
 However, you must not forget that 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.610
 they do not use a lot of tools 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.280
 offers and then it already gives me 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.490
 again too much at 46 grams stops 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.850
 but still on that one is off 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.770
 heard it is not me 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.660
 dissatisfied with it but am for that 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.520
 weight even if it is not in itself 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.110
 It does not weigh much 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.370
 enough has to be taken every day 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.300
 especially if there are better alternatives 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:30.100
 are as the victorinox band have 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.080
 The nail file fell while the band 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.360
 but not me personally 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.640
 further bothers were opened for cans 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.530
 bottle opener folded what I 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.430
 Personally, it's very convenient 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.200
 I really need both tools 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.670
 Not so often that I'm on the minimal 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.520
 better opener by cadet 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.950
 would be dependent and thus I spoke 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.390
 again clearly place and weight of the 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.280
 Although small screwdriver is also 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.900
 but I had lost it 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.190
 actually always the problem since the 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.710
 often not slightly countersunk screws 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:01.750
 probably also reached 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:03.850
 not further for that has been on the 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.710
 weight and size a lot done so 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:06.870
 the band is flatter and 40 percent flatter 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:08.710
 40 percent lighter 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.160
 and the same for me 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.160
 functionality 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.900
 if I am between the cadet with the 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.439
 band time would have to decide 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.819
 so in any case the band will take 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:30.590
 it's just extremely flat and light 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.689
 so you can do it easily anytime 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.790
 can take it without it 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:38.319
 it's even so shallow that you can do it 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.319
 just take the purse with you 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.280
 I wish you a nice one 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:45.609
 weekend and many thanks for 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.609
 watch
