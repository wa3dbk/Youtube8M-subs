so how does that relate to the ride

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.090 
so how does that relate to the ride
cymbal<00:01:21.450> spending<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.140> lot<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.380> time<00:01:22.530> playing

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
cymbal spending a lot of time playing

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.640 
cymbal spending a lot of time playing
the<00:01:23.310> ride<00:01:23.490> cymbal<00:01:23.940> a<00:01:24.150> lot<00:01:24.690> of<00:01:24.810> temples<00:01:25.230> a<00:01:25.440> lot

the ride cymbal a lot of temples a lot
of<00:01:25.800> different<00:01:26.040> dynamics<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.730> that's<00:01:26.820> also

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
of different dynamics and that's also

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.240 
of different dynamics and that's also
very<00:01:27.390> important<00:01:27.930> because<00:01:28.380> what<00:01:28.680> I<00:01:28.710> find<00:01:29.010> for<00:01:29.220> a

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
comfortable with in two or three

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.070 
comfortable with in two or three
different<00:01:34.590> dynamics<00:01:35.580> but<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.330> have<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.690> kind

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
different dynamics but you have to kind

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.870 
different dynamics but you have to kind
of<00:01:37.140> spread<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:37.440> out<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.860> play<00:01:38.010> work<00:01:38.700> on

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
of spread that out and play work on

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.030 
of spread that out and play work on
