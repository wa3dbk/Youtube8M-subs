00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
what do we get you one friction is it

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.000 
what do we get you one friction is it
had<00:00:35.850> CLG<00:00:36.360> so<00:00:36.690> because<00:00:37.050> CLG<00:00:37.710> it's<00:00:37.860> their

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
had CLG so because CLG it's their

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
to have seconds go okay for CLG I think

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.290 
to have seconds go okay for CLG I think
the<00:00:43.710> most<00:00:43.829> more<00:00:44.070> thing<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.610> secure<00:00:44.940> at<00:00:45.180> the

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
the most more thing is to secure at the

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
still you need to prepare for that they

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:05.969 
still you need to prepare for that they
have<00:01:04.600> to<00:01:04.690> do<00:01:04.780> that<00:01:04.900> in<00:01:05.080> drafting<00:01:05.500> phase<00:01:05.710> they

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
have to do that in drafting phase they

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:07.530 
have to do that in drafting phase they
don't<00:01:06.190> want<00:01:06.340> to<00:01:06.400> give<00:01:06.490> away<00:01:06.520> a<00:01:06.700> 02<00:01:07.150> Bjork's<00:01:07.420> in

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
don't want to give away a 02 Bjork's in

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.600 
don't want to give away a 02 Bjork's in
that<00:01:07.810> would<00:01:07.990> be<00:01:08.110> crucial<00:01:08.500> co<00:01:08.950> ji<00:01:09.160> also<00:01:09.460> can

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
that would be crucial co ji also can

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.090 
that would be crucial co ji also can
rely<00:01:09.910> on<00:01:10.180> their<00:01:10.330> early<00:01:10.750> game<00:01:11.020> power<00:01:11.320> they<00:01:11.890> have

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
rely on their early game power they have

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.400 
rely on their early game power they have
the<00:01:12.369> second<00:01:12.760> highest<00:01:12.790> goal<00:01:13.330> lead<00:01:13.510> from<00:01:14.290> the

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.410 
the second highest goal lead from the

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:16.170 
the second highest goal lead from the
normal<00:01:14.710> season<00:01:15.040> of<00:01:15.160> all<00:01:15.340> the<00:01:15.490> teams<00:01:15.729> and<00:01:15.940> it

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
normal season of all the teams and it

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.520 
normal season of all the teams and it
comes<00:01:16.360> a<00:01:16.450> lot<00:01:16.570> through<00:01:16.780> lane<00:01:16.990> swap<00:01:17.229> so<00:01:17.410> I<00:01:17.440> think

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
comes a lot through lane swap so I think

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:18.840 
comes a lot through lane swap so I think
they<00:01:17.740> should<00:01:17.979> favor<00:01:18.250> the<00:01:18.430> lane<00:01:18.550> swaps

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
they should favor the lane swaps

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.010 
they should favor the lane swaps
although<00:01:19.119> the<00:01:19.240> sand<00:01:19.450> Alliance<00:01:19.690> wouldn't<00:01:19.960> be

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
although the sand Alliance wouldn't be

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.780 
although the sand Alliance wouldn't be
that<00:01:20.200> bad<00:01:20.350> as<00:01:20.590> long<00:01:20.650> as<00:01:20.920> smithy<00:01:21.130> can<00:01:21.640> keep

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
that bad as long as smithy can keep

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.540 
that bad as long as smithy can keep

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550 
centauran out of SS face now the other

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.430 
centauran out of SS face now the other
thing<00:01:24.700> is<00:01:25.090> that<00:01:25.390> since<00:01:25.630> it<00:01:25.810> is<00:01:25.899> a<00:01:25.930> pacified

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
thing is that since it is a pacified

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.820 
thing is that since it is a pacified
they<00:01:26.619> have<00:01:26.800> to<00:01:26.950> prepare<00:01:27.250> the<00:01:27.460> back-up<00:01:27.850> plan

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
they have to prepare the back-up plan

yeah<00:01:29.830> you're<00:01:29.979> done<00:01:30.160> you<00:01:30.369> get<00:01:30.460> no<00:01:30.550> backup<00:01:30.820> plan

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
yeah you're done you get no backup plan

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.219 
yeah you're done you get no backup plan
is<00:01:31.720> no<00:01:31.930> switch<00:01:32.410> to<00:01:33.420> account<00:01:34.420> ok<00:01:34.660> so<00:01:34.720> here<00:01:35.140> we<00:01:35.200> go

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
is no switch to account ok so here we go
