00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.480
 Welcome to Modest Tastes Cuisine 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.480
 get the best of greetings 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.320
 in this section we have a beautiful meatballs recipe specific to Ramadan 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.600
 We will share the description of "Söğür Köftesi" 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.200
 But if you want to have a look at the necessary materials before 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.040
 half pound of ground beef 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.040
 3 slices of stale bread 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.360
 1 piece of dry onion 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.640
 half bunch of parsley 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.480
 1 teaspoon of cumin 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.240
 1 teaspoon black pepper 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.920
 and salt 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.480
 for inside; 3 eggs 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.480
 1 tbsp butter 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.280
 and salt 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.600
 let's go to the construction of the sour meatballs 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.800
 First of all, we take the bread ... 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.240
 cut into several pieces 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.240
 and take it to the kneading pan 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.840
 grate onion on top 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.840
 heal with his water 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.840
 while the bread softens in the onion water ... 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.080
 Let us continue by chopping parsley 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.240
 In the meantime our bread has softened very well 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.840
 continue by adding our other materials 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.200
 salt... 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.800
 Cumin ... 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.800
 chopping 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.160
 I would recommend using a little bit of ground meat 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.240
 after a little knead will add parsley 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.200
 as you see began to integrate 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:29.400
 add the last parsley to prevent it from being harmed 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.000
 and parsley are homogenous enough to be homogenous 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 that's enough 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.440
 Now let's put it in the fridge for half an hour to rest 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.680
 Our meatballs are being rested, so let's prepare the interior stuff. 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.800
 We have stated that we have 3 eggs. 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.000
 we breaks 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.520
 In fact, our inner material is a kind of omelette 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.000
 add very little salt to contribute to its degradation 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 and flutter 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
 we put the pan in the fire 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.480
 if you remember we had butter on the material list 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.480
 let's wait for a little melt 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.440
 Now that the oil is melting, let's pour the egg we whisk 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.200
 let's cook in the shape of an omelet 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.160
 our meatballs are rested, our omelet is frozen 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.200
 time to meet now 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:44.520
 we open our meatballs with oil on our finger tips 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.800
 trim the edges nicely 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.440
 we will not put our omelet as it is 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.840
 will leave pieces for balanced distribution 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.880
 this way after placing 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.640
 With the help of oily paper ... 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:20.000
 but we'll make a roll of greasy paper so you don't stay inside 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.720
 unlike the usual roll meatballs we will cook by slicing 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.880
 will make slices thick with a thumb finger 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.720
 after cutting the last slice 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:49.760
 we will leave our slices in various parts of the greaseproof paper 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.240
 we put it on the same paper this way 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.240
 now we can now transfer to tray 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.880
 In the meantime we warmed our oven at 190 degrees, let's give it to the oven 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.880
 25 minutes later 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.880
 baked patties, baked from the oven 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.080
 190 degrees baked 35-30 minutes in the oven 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.520
 in a short time 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.520
 Now is the service time 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:24.200
 let's transfer it to a serving plate 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.520
 Modest Flavors in this part of the kitchen ... 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:38.160
 rather, we shared a stylish-looking meatball recipe for Ramadan. 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.160
 We learned about the construction of "Söğür Meatball" 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.560
 I would like you to try and remember us as soon as possible, sir 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.120
 goodbye...
