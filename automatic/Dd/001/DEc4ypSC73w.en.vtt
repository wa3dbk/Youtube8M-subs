have<00:01:29.910> chia<00:01:30.180> seeds<00:01:30.479> stuck<00:01:30.750> in<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.020> inside<00:01:31.410> cuz

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
have chia seeds stuck in the inside cuz

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.400 
have chia seeds stuck in the inside cuz
they're<00:01:32.880> not<00:01:33.030> going<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.270> hurt<00:01:33.420> anything<00:01:33.540> plus

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.410

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.350 
I think it'd be funny if they started
growing<00:01:36.170> and<00:01:37.369> then<00:01:38.369> I'm<00:01:38.550> also<00:01:38.700> going<00:01:38.910> to<00:01:38.970> put<00:01:39.330> a
