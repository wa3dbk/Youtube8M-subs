00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
do that and it's pretty important to

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:40.580 
do that and it's pretty important to
have<00:02:39.360> a<00:02:39.420> good<00:02:39.569> internet<00:02:39.900> connection<00:02:40.110> because

when you're fighting battling like that

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.140 
when you're fighting battling like that
having<00:02:44.069> a<00:02:44.160> good<00:02:44.280> internet<00:02:44.519> connection<00:02:44.640> also

having a good internet connection also

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.030 
having a good internet connection also
it<00:02:45.360> gives<00:02:45.510> you<00:02:45.690> a<00:02:45.900> little<00:02:46.290> bit<00:02:46.470> upper<00:02:46.830> hand

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.390 
it gives you a little bit upper hand
because<00:02:47.370> if<00:02:47.730> you're<00:02:47.880> lagging<00:02:48.120> and<00:02:49.400> swinging

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400
