I love these icy watery worlds because
it<00:01:52.509> shows<00:01:52.780> that<00:01:52.810> maybe<00:01:53.259> the<00:01:53.410> first<00:01:53.560> way<00:01:53.770> we'll

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
it shows that maybe the first way we'll

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.199 
it shows that maybe the first way we'll
find<00:01:54.190> out<00:01:54.399> whether<00:01:54.580> there's<00:01:54.819> life<00:01:54.970> out<00:01:55.179> there

and<00:03:55.980> you<00:03:56.069> lick<00:03:56.220> your<00:03:56.340> finger<00:03:56.640> and<00:03:56.760> stick<00:03:56.910> it

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
and you lick your finger and stick it

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.180 
and you lick your finger and stick it
out<00:03:57.150> the<00:03:57.269> porthole<00:03:57.660> you'll<00:03:58.290> feel<00:03:58.620> that<00:03:58.650> wind

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
out the porthole you'll feel that wind

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:04.250 
out the porthole you'll feel that wind
rushing<00:03:59.730> past<00:04:01.700> that<00:04:02.700> wind<00:04:03.030> creates<00:04:03.660> a<00:04:03.810> giant

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
rushing past that wind creates a giant

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.440 
rushing past that wind creates a giant
bubble<00:04:04.470> around<00:04:05.069> our<00:04:05.220> planetary<00:04:05.730> system<00:04:05.760> the

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
bubble around our planetary system the

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:09.140 
bubble around our planetary system the
heliosphere<00:04:07.010> it<00:04:08.010> protects<00:04:08.519> us<00:04:08.670> from<00:04:08.879> the

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
heliosphere it protects us from the

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.319 
heliosphere it protects us from the
harshness<00:04:09.269> of<00:04:09.930> interstellar<00:04:10.650> space<00:04:11.209> so<00:04:12.209> it's

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
harshness of interstellar space so it's

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:13.849 
harshness of interstellar space so it's
a<00:04:12.360> little<00:04:12.540> like<00:04:12.660> the<00:04:12.690> Sun<00:04:13.049> has<00:04:13.230> a<00:04:13.260> nice<00:04:13.440> harbor

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859 
a little like the Sun has a nice harbor

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:15.289 
a little like the Sun has a nice harbor
around<00:04:13.980> it<00:04:14.280> where<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:14.519> waves<00:04:14.730> are<00:04:14.970> nice<00:04:15.090> and

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
around it where the waves are nice and

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.300 
around it where the waves are nice and
low<00:04:15.720> and<00:04:15.930> then<00:04:16.320> there's<00:04:16.500> this<00:04:16.620> barrier<00:04:17.100> the

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
low and then there's this barrier the

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.279 
low and then there's this barrier the
breakwater<00:04:18.120> that<00:04:18.389> prevents<00:04:18.840> those<00:04:18.989> big

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
breakwater that prevents those big

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:21.740 
breakwater that prevents those big
cosmic<00:04:19.979> high-energy<00:04:20.370> waves<00:04:20.880> from<00:04:21.419> coming

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
cosmic high-energy waves from coming

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.439 
cosmic high-energy waves from coming
into<00:04:21.900> our<00:04:21.989> harbor<00:04:22.430> those<00:04:23.430> cosmic<00:04:23.850> high-energy

00:04:24.439 --> 00:04:24.449 
into our harbor those cosmic high-energy

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:27.490 
into our harbor those cosmic high-energy
waves<00:04:24.900> are<00:04:25.289> born<00:04:25.740> in<00:04:26.010> exploding<00:04:26.820> stars

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
waves are born in exploding stars

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.620 
waves are born in exploding stars
supernovae<00:04:28.500> and<00:04:28.650> they<00:04:29.550> are<00:04:29.760> life<00:04:30.150> destroying

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
supernovae and they are life destroying

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.409 
supernovae and they are life destroying
but<00:04:31.320> fortunately<00:04:31.979> the<00:04:32.430> cosmic<00:04:32.910> rays<00:04:33.150> are

00:04:33.409 --> 00:04:33.419 
but fortunately the cosmic rays are

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:36.290 
but fortunately the cosmic rays are
charged<00:04:33.990> particles<00:04:34.620> so<00:04:35.370> they're<00:04:35.850> pushed<00:04:36.150> away

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
charged particles so they're pushed away

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.219 
charged particles so they're pushed away
by<00:04:36.930> magnetic<00:04:37.350> fields<00:04:38.150> our<00:04:39.150> heliosphere<00:04:39.960> is

into the interstellar region they'll

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.420 
into the interstellar region they'll

if<00:05:24.949> this<00:05:25.130> is<00:05:25.250> the<00:05:25.370> actual<00:05:25.789> signal<00:05:26.000> from<00:05:26.449> the

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:26.630 
if this is the actual signal from the

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:28.210 
if this is the actual signal from the
Voyager<00:05:26.780> spacecraft<00:05:27.199> and<00:05:27.740> you<00:05:27.800> can<00:05:27.919> see<00:05:28.070> this

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:28.220 
Voyager spacecraft and you can see this

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:29.080 
Voyager spacecraft and you can see this
tiny<00:05:28.490> little<00:05:28.580> peak

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
tiny little peak

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.390 
tiny little peak
hey<00:05:29.389> sandy<00:05:29.870> here<00:05:30.080> all<00:05:30.289> this<00:05:30.590> other<00:05:30.949> stuff<00:05:31.220> is

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
hey sandy here all this other stuff is

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.010 
hey sandy here all this other stuff is
noise<00:05:31.759> coming<00:05:32.180> through<00:05:32.389> the<00:05:32.539> universe<00:05:32.810> it's

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.020 
noise coming through the universe it's

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.080 
noise coming through the universe it's
fantastic<00:05:33.620> so<00:05:33.770> that<00:05:33.919> I<00:05:34.130> mean<00:05:34.639> we're<00:05:34.789> getting<00:05:34.880> a

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
fantastic so that I mean we're getting a

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:36.850 
fantastic so that I mean we're getting a
signal<00:05:35.539> from<00:05:35.930> the<00:05:36.080> very<00:05:36.289> edge<00:05:36.440> of<00:05:36.560> the<00:05:36.680> solar

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860 
signal from the very edge of the solar

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.499 
signal from the very edge of the solar
system<00:05:36.979> yeah<00:05:37.639> and<00:05:37.850> got<00:05:38.090> to<00:05:38.150> think<00:05:38.270> about<00:05:38.330> this

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:38.509 
system yeah and got to think about this

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:41.650 
system yeah and got to think about this
signal<00:05:38.900> is<00:05:39.110> twenty<00:05:39.889> billion<00:05:40.580> times<00:05:41.180> weaker

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 
signal is twenty billion times weaker

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.900 
signal is twenty billion times weaker
than<00:05:41.690> the<00:05:42.350> power<00:05:42.560> of<00:05:42.710> a<00:05:42.800> watch<00:05:43.070> battery<00:05:43.340> so

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:43.910 
than the power of a watch battery so

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:45.730 
than the power of a watch battery so
it's<00:05:44.300> quite<00:05:44.539> it's<00:05:44.690> no<00:05:44.900> mean<00:05:45.139> feat<00:05:45.169> to<00:05:45.590> better

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
it's quite it's no mean feat to better

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.260 
it's quite it's no mean feat to better
pick<00:05:45.949> this<00:05:46.070> up<00:05:46.220> out<00:05:46.400> of<00:05:46.490> all<00:05:46.580> that<00:05:46.729> noise<00:05:46.880> yeah

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.270 
pick this up out of all that noise yeah

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.469 
pick this up out of all that noise yeah
yeah<00:05:47.780> and<00:05:48.050> Voyager<00:05:48.620> One's<00:05:49.009> news<00:05:49.340> is<00:05:49.580> it<00:05:50.090> is

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:50.479 
yeah and Voyager One's news is it is

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:52.390 
yeah and Voyager One's news is it is
starting<00:05:51.050> to<00:05:51.139> break<00:05:51.350> through<00:05:51.650> the<00:05:51.860> protective

main thing that Voyager is seeing is the

magnetic field and then we really will

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:25.360

have<00:06:23.599> escaped<00:06:24.020> the<00:06:24.169> solar<00:06:24.410> system<00:06:24.889> and

have escaped the solar system and

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:28.420 
have escaped the solar system and
there's<00:06:26.060> more<00:06:26.300> to<00:06:26.449> come<00:06:26.660> after<00:06:26.870> that<00:06:27.310> what<00:06:28.310> is

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:28.430 
there's more to come after that what is

there's more to come after that what is
the<00:06:28.520> future<00:06:28.789> for<00:06:28.940> the<00:06:29.060> voyagers<00:06:29.510> well

that could be done but after that

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:42.310
