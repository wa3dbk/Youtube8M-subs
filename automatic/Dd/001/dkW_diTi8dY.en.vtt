00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 take a squared piece of paper 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.150
 taken from a sheet a4 and as before 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.090
 what I call the sheet for all 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.990
 half therefore both diagonals for in 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.990
 horizontal and vertical 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:36.180
 once you've done it 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:38.520
 we will make a kite phase so take it 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.899
 your sheet folded none of the 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:45.030
 diagonals that we make the base a 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.980
 square then we reverse these folds 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:53.850
 so this folding carry 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:56.160
 inside this fold we do it 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.180
 become a valley fold and this side 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.690
 let's match that 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.559
 below and we repeat with this 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.559
 triangle 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:21.760
 Now let 's do the pylon base therefore 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:27.820
 we take each of these fins ne 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:29.890
 we open here inside and this fold 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:35.260
 central we match it with 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:40.030
 this below we crush everything and 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:42.520
 we mark the folds and repeat with 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:58.390
 and then all four of the other 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:02:00.820
 another three hours 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:05.650
 pressing the model with all these 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:07.630
 parts that can be opened in evidence therefore not in 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.240
 this way but this way 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:14.430
 we take this side we take it to 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.430
 center and we will repeat with this other side 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:30.400
 reopen these folds and now let's open 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.870
 this loaned and with 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.430
 the help of the folds we have just 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:42.870
 done then pressing on these tips 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:44.950
 we will have to create a small roar therefore 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.000
 we do this part of a sheet 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.110
 match with the leaf part 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.709
 below we press and make in 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:57.090
 so that a finite is formed here and then 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.090
 we bring everything down 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.060
 in this way 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:08.810
 we'll have this roar here and we'll have to 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:13.239
 repeat on all these sides on 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.239
 all sides that have this shape 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:37.370
 once arrived here we will take the 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:40.010
 our model and making sure that there is 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:44.150
 are the same amount of fins from 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:46.250
 this side then 4 here and 4 here 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.639
 take a read , move it towards 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:52.909
 right we turn the model and repeat 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:55.310
 so in essence not to have always 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:58.159
 4 flaps on each side 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.919
 but that side must be the one 

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:05.500
 with no folds like this either here or 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:10.549
 from here and we will take this side then 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:12.620
 the side without the triangle then the 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:15.500
 on the upper side we leave it we leave it 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:21.039
 same we will take the side that 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:21.039
 below and we bring it here to the center 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.130
 in this way 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:34.580
 which we will repeat with this one 

00:04:32.629 --> 00:04:37.930
 once done this step it 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.930
 we repeat on all sides 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.139
 now arm yourself with scissors 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:59.919
 and we will have to cut each of these 

00:04:55.089 --> 00:05:04.240
 lines this way this little triangle 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:06.460
 this below as the first thing 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.490
 we click on itself to outline 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:22.389
 where we will end up with the cut e 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:35.499
 we will cut in the center and repeat with 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:37.539
 each of these ends to this 

00:05:35.499 --> 00:05:42.430
 point we will take our model it 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:46.979
 we will turn this triangle upside down 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.979
 we fold it in half backwards like this 

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:53.630
 so you have this little triangle here 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:56.180
 behind and now we will take each of these 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:06:01.790
 end he will bend in this way 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:02.390
 if we take, we quarrel backwards in 

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:08.450
 diagonal 

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:11.450
 so the first the first row 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:12.980
 we make the second row very short 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:14.360
 let's do a little less port etc. 

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.610
 etc. in short, it should 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:21.380
 form a kind of scale 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:23.120
 that way these will be 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:26.620
 obviously our paws 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.620
 if our spider's legs 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:37.660
 keep bending all ends 

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:37.660
 always making a scale 

00:06:55.080 --> 00:07:01.080
 and at this point we will bend back into 

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:03.689
 this way only upwards 

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:06.469
 and on this half that is on half of 

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:12.090
 this triangle then formed 

00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:14.539
 in this way on all legs of 

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:14.539
 new 

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:37.740
 I advise you to start with the paw 

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:41.320
 higher up so you don't have too many 

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:43.440
 too much paper in the middle that will give you 

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.440
 nuisance 

00:07:55.340 --> 00:08:00.870
 first of your web 

00:07:58.830 --> 00:08:06.770
 think over your bathroom and you'll have 

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:06.770
 so your spider finished
