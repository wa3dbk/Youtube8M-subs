that pull on both hands or it's gonna go

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.220 
that pull on both hands or it's gonna go
light<00:02:31.310> on<00:02:31.520> both<00:02:31.910> hands<00:02:32.239> and<00:02:32.870> it's<00:02:33.140> a

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
light on both hands and it's a

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.620 
light on both hands and it's a
combination<00:02:33.980> of<00:02:34.069> those<00:02:34.310> which<00:02:35.239> tells<00:02:35.540> me

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
combination of those which tells me

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.559 
combination of those which tells me
exactly<00:02:35.810> where<00:02:36.410> the<00:02:36.560> glider<00:02:36.860> is<00:02:37.130> if<00:02:38.120> it<00:02:38.360> pulls

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
exactly where the glider is if it pulls

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.490 
exactly where the glider is if it pulls
on<00:02:38.780> one<00:02:39.110> hand<00:02:39.670> pullback<00:02:40.670> if<00:02:41.569> it<00:02:41.750> goes<00:02:41.930> light<00:02:42.260> on

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
on one hand pullback if it goes light on

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.330 
on one hand pullback if it goes light on
one<00:02:42.709> hand<00:02:43.100> let<00:02:44.090> up<00:02:44.300> if<00:02:45.050> it<00:02:45.320> pulls<00:02:45.620> on<00:02:45.860> both

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
one hand let up if it pulls on both

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.850 
one hand let up if it pulls on both
hands<00:02:47.060> then<00:02:47.810> you<00:02:47.840> know<00:02:48.080> what's<00:02:48.230> going<00:02:48.440> behind

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
hands then you know what's going behind

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.310 
hands then you know what's going behind
you<00:02:49.040> so<00:02:49.220> you<00:02:49.280> let<00:02:49.519> up<00:02:49.760> on<00:02:50.000> both<00:02:50.269> hands<00:02:50.570> and<00:02:51.170> if

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
you so you let up on both hands and if

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.050 
you so you let up on both hands and if
it<00:02:51.440> goes<00:02:51.560> light<00:02:51.980> on<00:02:52.250> both<00:02:52.519> hands

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
it goes light on both hands

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.090 
it goes light on both hands
you<00:02:53.269> know<00:02:53.390> it's<00:02:53.570> surging<00:02:53.930> in<00:02:54.050> front<00:02:54.290> of<00:02:54.380> you<00:02:54.530> so

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
you know it's surging in front of you so

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.150 
you know it's surging in front of you so
you<00:02:55.160> pull<00:02:55.940> on<00:02:56.300> both<00:02:56.360> hands<00:02:56.930> and<00:02:57.230> by<00:02:57.950> that

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
you pull on both hands and by that

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.699 
you pull on both hands and by that
combination<00:02:58.550> of<00:02:58.940> things<00:02:59.000> I<00:02:59.569> can<00:03:00.260> sit<00:03:00.470> here<00:03:00.500> and

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
combination of things I can sit here and

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.250 
combination of things I can sit here and
fly<00:03:01.100> with<00:03:02.000> my<00:03:02.209> eyes<00:03:02.450> closed

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
fly with my eyes closed

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.370 
fly with my eyes closed
now<00:03:03.920> we<00:03:04.819> don't<00:03:05.090> suggest<00:03:05.300> that<00:03:05.600> you<00:03:05.810> fly<00:03:06.080> with

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
now we don't suggest that you fly with

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.270 
now we don't suggest that you fly with
your<00:03:06.500> eyes<00:03:06.709> closed<00:03:07.209> but<00:03:08.380> what<00:03:09.380> happens<00:03:09.890> is<00:03:10.100> you

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
your eyes closed but what happens is you

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.120 
your eyes closed but what happens is you
develop<00:03:10.430> a<00:03:10.850> feel<00:03:11.239> that<00:03:11.989> is<00:03:12.110> so<00:03:12.290> precise<00:03:12.739> on<00:03:13.010> the

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
develop a feel that is so precise on the

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.180 
develop a feel that is so precise on the
ground<00:03:13.450> that<00:03:14.450> you<00:03:14.480> will<00:03:14.780> have<00:03:14.989> instincts<00:03:15.950> in

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
ground that you will have instincts in

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.420 
ground that you will have instincts in
the<00:03:16.340> air<00:03:16.720> so<00:03:17.720> if<00:03:17.989> the<00:03:18.140> glider<00:03:18.410> surges<00:03:19.040> in<00:03:19.160> front

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
the air so if the glider surges in front

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.670 
the air so if the glider surges in front
of<00:03:19.549> you<00:03:19.730> you<00:03:20.329> won't<00:03:20.510> even<00:03:20.630> think<00:03:20.780> about<00:03:21.260> it<00:03:21.560> you

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
of you you won't even think about it you

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.100 
of you you won't even think about it you
will<00:03:21.769> instinctively<00:03:22.459> pull<00:03:23.150> the<00:03:23.299> brakes<00:03:23.540> and

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
will instinctively pull the brakes and

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:26.979 
will instinctively pull the brakes and
prevent<00:03:24.620> it<00:03:24.739> from<00:03:24.769> over<00:03:25.310> flying<00:03:25.640> you<00:03:25.910> the<00:03:26.600> same

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
goes if the glider goes behind you

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.600 
goes if the glider goes behind you
instinctively<00:03:30.200> if<00:03:30.769> you<00:03:30.950> get<00:03:31.190> to<00:03:31.340> the<00:03:31.430> point

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
instinctively if you get to the point

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.199 
the difference between having a problem
and<00:03:56.450> not<00:03:57.109> just<00:03:57.680> like<00:03:57.859> in<00:03:58.010> fighting<00:03:58.459> you<00:03:59.180> know

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
and not just like in fighting you know

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.509 
and not just like in fighting you know
if<00:03:59.570> you<00:03:59.690> wait<00:03:59.870> one<00:04:00.200> half<00:04:00.440> second<00:04:00.950> it's<00:04:01.400> the

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
if you wait one half second it's the

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.099 
if you wait one half second it's the
difference<00:04:01.940> between<00:04:02.000> getting<00:04:02.750> hit<00:04:02.959> in<00:04:03.079> the

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:03.109 
difference between getting hit in the

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:06.789 
difference between getting hit in the
face<00:04:03.230> or<00:04:03.950> blocking<00:04:04.700> it<00:04:04.880> so<00:04:05.090> you<00:04:05.600> must<00:04:06.049> practice

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:06.799 
face or blocking it so you must practice

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:10.300 
face or blocking it so you must practice
until<00:04:07.579> you're<00:04:07.760> at<00:04:07.880> a<00:04:07.910> state<00:04:08.239> of<00:04:08.510> motion<00:04:09.310> where

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
until you're at a state of motion where

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.300 
until you're at a state of motion where
you<00:04:10.430> can<00:04:10.640> react<00:04:11.000> instinctively<00:04:11.380> and<00:04:12.380> then<00:04:12.890> you

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
you can react instinctively and then you

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.599 
you can react instinctively and then you
will<00:04:13.459> be<00:04:13.640> as<00:04:13.850> safe<00:04:14.209> as<00:04:14.420> you<00:04:14.450> can<00:04:14.660> be<00:04:14.870> so<00:04:15.609> let's

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
will be as safe as you can be so let's

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.500 
will be as safe as you can be so let's
fly<00:04:16.850> away<00:04:17.180> oh<00:04:17.500> yeah
