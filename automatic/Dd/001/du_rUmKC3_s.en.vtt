00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:24.529
 Crankshaft turn sensor 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.349
 it is a type sensor that negative col effect 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.640
 and as you can see 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.700
 is installed 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.700
 in silver by road 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.950
 as a polar piece 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.360
 n 60 - two teeth 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.070
 this polar piece 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.690
 that has a north pole 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.080
 and a south pole 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.080
 and interacts with the sensor 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.460
 the signal that the sensor produces 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.610
 It is the most important system 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.870
 since with that signal 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.480
 Computer 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.480
 active fuel pump relay 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.290
 activate the injection 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.290
 installed to the ignition system 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.810
 a corp effect 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.590
 l have a ground power 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.630
 a power supply 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.780
 and its signal line 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.740
 let's test the sensor by energizing what 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.800
 to be able to carry out our bank program 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.170
 we are going to put direct earth 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.290
 now we need 100 x ar to the current collector 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.840
 but to avoid problems and possible damages to the agreed 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.930
 let's energize with current 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.910
 but it takes away something 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.910
 through a plan for testing 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.460
 we are going to inject 12 volts 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.680
 but without operating 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.340
 and add 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.870
 what the filament of the lamp I limit myself to the current 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.249
 right away we will connect our diode lamps to currents 

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:13.749
 you already remember that the sensor 

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:17.919
 will send us a signal of pulses of earth 

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:20.919
 if they are in good condition 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.819
 we connect and now we are going to turn 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:27.589
 the polar piece 

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:29.759
 and we can appreciate 

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:33.059
 keeler takeoff 

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:34.569
 this medical 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.569
 because the taster is in good condition 

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:40.189
 logically 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:43.459
 if we turn the polar piece 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.179
 at a higher speed 

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:48.729
 well you can see that the signals much faster 

00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:55.209
 to stop a test with the engine running 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:57.169
 so what 

00:02:57.169 --> 00:03:00.079
 is going to see with a very fast flash 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:01.789
 for that it is recommended 

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:03.499
 better complexion ar 

00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:04.849
 a skopie well
