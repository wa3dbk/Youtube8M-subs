00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
is it's like a it kills all the zombies

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.610 
is it's like a it kills all the zombies
in<00:02:34.120> a<00:02:34.330> radius<00:02:34.660> but<00:02:34.840> you<00:02:34.960> want<00:02:35.140> to<00:02:35.260> be<00:02:35.350> able<00:02:35.440> to

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
in a radius but you want to be able to

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.410 
in a radius but you want to be able to
use<00:02:35.740> that<00:02:35.770> plant<00:02:36.220> pot<00:02:36.430> for<00:02:36.670> a<00:02:36.700> long<00:02:36.940> time<00:02:37.210> and
