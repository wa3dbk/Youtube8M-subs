look<00:04:03.879> like<00:04:04.120> after<00:04:04.629> assembly<00:04:05.250> just<00:04:06.250> think

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
look like after assembly just think

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:09.569 
look like after assembly just think
about<00:04:06.700> attaching<00:04:07.599> the<00:04:08.049> side<00:04:08.739> covers<00:04:09.340> before

that's it so far so let's have a look at

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:20.310 
that's it so far so let's have a look at
the<00:04:15.010> result<00:04:15.430> outside
