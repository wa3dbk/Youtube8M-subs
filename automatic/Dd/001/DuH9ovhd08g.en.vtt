00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.860
 concept five three pillars of 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.480
 very important training where 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.760
 we trained the control 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.400
 we train the functionality in the case of 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.920
 south fee and we train all the chains 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.079
 a new concept that came from the 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.050
 germany which is the concept where 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:09.210
 we will work the pain and we will take away this pain 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.210
 for better wave performance 

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:32.460
 and now we see here in the center of 

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:35.159
 home training in one resort 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.829

 our integrated pilates system is the 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.950
 control training where together with a 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.079
 good breathing we will learn to contract 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:52.069
 muscles to have a good 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:56.310
 movement and good body awareness 

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:58.709
 functional training is where we will 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.390
 fundamental movements such as pushing 

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:05.189
 pull skip move 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:08.129
 we will potentiate this in exercises 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.410
 together with the specific training in 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:13.769
 case of surfing where we will improve 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:17.940
 ripped a drop or even balance 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:20.280
 on the board and finally we have the 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.230
 five a German concept where 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.250
 we will work on stretching the chains 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.849
 muscle 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.069
