00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
little trick to deter them because it's

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.660 
little trick to deter them because it's
very<00:01:15.780> easy<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.140> break<00:01:16.380> them<00:01:16.680> so<00:01:17.040> all<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.490> have

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
very easy to break them so all you have

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.010 
very easy to break them so all you have
to<00:01:17.820> do<00:01:17.970> is<00:01:18.119> just<00:01:18.530> pull<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.710> out<00:01:19.860> I<00:01:20.659> think<00:01:21.659> and

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
to do is just pull it out I think and

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.550 
to do is just pull it out I think and
comes<00:01:22.439> out<00:01:22.680> so<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:24.180> put<00:01:24.360> it<00:01:24.450> back<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:25.229> have<00:01:25.260> to

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
comes out so to put it back you have to

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.620 
comes out so to put it back you have to
just<00:01:25.830> put<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.700> back<00:01:27.229> push<00:01:28.229> it<00:01:28.380> in<00:01:29.000> so<00:01:30.000> that's

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
just put it back push it in so that's

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.960 
just put it back push it in so that's
the<00:01:30.869> trick<00:01:31.110> on<00:01:31.439> this<00:01:32.250> one

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.680 

and<00:01:35.740> on<00:01:36.740> this<00:01:37.040> one<00:01:37.100> actually<00:01:37.520> they<00:01:38.270> design<00:01:38.660> it

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
and on this one actually they design it

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.150 
and on this one actually they design it
like<00:01:38.960> this<00:01:39.140> you'll<00:01:39.350> flip<00:01:39.590> this<00:01:39.830> with<00:01:40.040> your

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:40.160 
like this you'll flip this with your

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:50.020 
like this you'll flip this with your
nail<00:01:41.710> flip<00:01:42.710> it<00:01:42.830> up<00:01:43.060> and<00:01:44.060> it<00:01:44.480> comes<00:01:44.720> out<00:01:45.490> so<00:01:49.030> like

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
nail flip it up and it comes out so like

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.850 
nail flip it up and it comes out so like
this<00:01:51.130> like<00:01:52.130> this<00:01:52.630> this<00:01:53.630> one<00:01:53.930> is<00:01:53.960> just<00:01:54.440> you<00:01:54.650> push

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
this like this this one is just you push

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.050 
this like this this one is just you push
it<00:01:55.010> in<00:01:55.160> and<00:01:55.370> out<00:01:56.260> so<00:01:57.260> just<00:01:57.530> be<00:01:57.710> careful<00:01:58.060> which

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
it in and out so just be careful which

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.710 
it in and out so just be careful which
one

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
one

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.720 
one
just<00:02:00.020> look<00:02:00.170> closely<00:02:00.500> which<00:02:00.830> one<00:02:01.070> does<00:02:01.400> it<00:02:01.520> have

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:01.730 
just look closely which one does it have

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.890 
just look closely which one does it have
because<00:02:02.150> either<00:02:02.360> this<00:02:02.690> one<00:02:02.960> or<00:02:03.220> this<00:02:04.220> one

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
because either this one or this one

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.020 
because either this one or this one
so<00:02:05.900> you<00:02:06.320> don't<00:02:06.440> break<00:02:06.710> this<00:02:06.890> and<00:02:07.550> then<00:02:07.910> you

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
so you don't break this and then you

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.570 
so you don't break this and then you
remove<00:02:08.240> all<00:02:08.450> the<00:02:08.480> screws<00:02:08.950> take<00:02:09.950> it<00:02:10.160> out<00:02:10.340> and

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
remove all the screws take it out and

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.800 
remove all the screws take it out and
put<00:02:11.360> the<00:02:11.660> new<00:02:12.380> piece<00:02:13.360> underneath<00:02:14.360> and

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
put the new piece underneath and

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.950 
put the new piece underneath and
reassemble<00:02:15.740> everything<00:02:15.860> back<00:02:16.430> and<00:02:17.120> that

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
reassemble everything back and that

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.620 
reassemble everything back and that
should<00:02:18.200> be<00:02:18.320> very<00:02:18.440> easy<00:02:18.710> to<00:02:18.860> do<00:02:19.130> it<00:02:19.280> so<00:02:20.240> only<00:02:20.360> few

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
should be very easy to do it so only few

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.600 
should be very easy to do it so only few
screws<00:02:20.900> just<00:02:20.990> make<00:02:21.320> sure<00:02:21.560> the<00:02:21.830> unit<00:02:22.520> is

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
screws just make sure the unit is

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.510 
screws just make sure the unit is
sitting<00:02:22.910> correctly<00:02:23.150> in<00:02:23.510> it<00:02:23.630> and<00:02:24.400> if<00:02:25.400> it

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
sitting correctly in it and if it

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.220 
sitting correctly in it and if it
doesn't<00:02:25.700> sit<00:02:26.090> correctly<00:02:26.660> you're<00:02:26.960> going<00:02:27.140> to

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
doesn't sit correctly you're going to

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.640 
doesn't sit correctly you're going to
see<00:02:27.470> it<00:02:28.180> I'm<00:02:29.180> going<00:02:29.390> to<00:02:29.450> see<00:02:29.600> some<00:02:29.780> spaces<00:02:30.440> over

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
see it I'm going to see some spaces over

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.870 
see it I'm going to see some spaces over
here<00:02:31.120> on<00:02:32.120> the<00:02:32.720> edges<00:02:33.140> so<00:02:33.170> it's<00:02:33.830> not<00:02:34.100> attached

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
here on the edges so it's not attached

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.250 
here on the edges so it's not attached
