00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
don't get me wrong a thousand jobs of

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:23.730 
don't get me wrong a thousand jobs of
1,300<00:01:21.820> jobs<00:01:21.850> we<00:01:22.510> think<00:01:22.720> it's<00:01:22.840> important<00:01:23.350> but

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
1,300 jobs we think it's important but

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.800 
1,300 jobs we think it's important but
for<00:01:23.920> half<00:01:24.070> a<00:01:24.220> billion<00:01:24.430> dollars<00:01:24.970> it<00:01:25.210> clearly

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
for half a billion dollars it clearly

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.570 
for half a billion dollars it clearly
missed<00:01:26.170> the<00:01:26.350> target<00:01:26.619> we<00:01:27.130> could<00:01:27.310> have<00:01:27.430> done

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
missed the target we could have done

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.039 
missed the target we could have done
better<00:01:27.850> by<00:01:28.119> throwing<00:01:28.360> the<00:01:28.540> money<00:01:28.689> out<00:01:28.900> of

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 
better by throwing the money out of

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:30.690 
better by throwing the money out of
window<00:01:29.380> right<00:01:29.740> sir<00:01:29.920> and<00:01:30.070> so<00:01:30.159> let's<00:01:30.340> talk<00:01:30.549> about

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
window right sir and so let's talk about

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.340 
window right sir and so let's talk about
that<00:01:30.939> a<00:01:31.000> little<00:01:31.090> bit<00:01:31.299> though<00:01:31.540> now<00:01:31.750> one<00:01:32.200> of<00:01:32.229> the
