part<00:02:16.370> and<00:02:17.030> this<00:02:17.870> is<00:02:17.959> where<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:18.230> batteries

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
part and this is where the batteries

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.080 
part and this is where the batteries
reside<00:02:18.950> so<00:02:19.549> you've<00:02:19.640> got<00:02:19.760> a<00:02:19.790> couple<00:02:19.940> of

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
reside so you've got a couple of

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.330 
reside so you've got a couple of
batteries<00:02:20.480> in<00:02:20.600> there<00:02:20.840> they're<00:02:21.470> essential<00:02:22.190> to

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
batteries in there they're essential to

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.220 
batteries in there they're essential to
use<00:02:22.760> these<00:02:22.910> headphones<00:02:23.180> so<00:02:23.630> you<00:02:23.690> do<00:02:23.930> need<00:02:24.109> the

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
batteries in there and that is because

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.830 
batteries in there and that is because
of<00:02:26.959> the<00:02:27.940> noise<00:02:28.940> reduction<00:02:29.269> feature<00:02:29.660> and<00:02:30.160> just

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
of the noise reduction feature and just

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.570 
of the noise reduction feature and just
unbelievable<00:02:32.840> quality<00:02:32.989> this<00:02:33.920> side<00:02:34.129> here<00:02:34.459> this

sets of audio headphones I've ever

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.740 
sets of audio headphones I've ever
tested<00:04:18.530> these<00:04:18.980> out<00:04:19.220> the<00:04:19.580> form<00:04:19.850> the<00:04:20.060> sole<00:04:20.239> of<00:04:20.269> HD

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
tested these out the form the sole of HD

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.170 
tested these out the form the sole of HD
is<00:04:20.810> not<00:04:20.900> by<00:04:21.169> a<00:04:21.200> lot<00:04:21.530> but<00:04:21.830> they<00:04:22.280> do<00:04:22.340> outperform

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
is not by a lot but they do outperform

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.180 
is not by a lot but they do outperform
them<00:04:23.390> a<00:04:23.419> little<00:04:23.870> bit<00:04:24.050> and<00:04:24.230> they<00:04:24.830> should<00:04:25.040> do

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
them a little bit and they should do

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.130 
them a little bit and they should do
really<00:04:25.430> because<00:04:25.820> they're<00:04:26.000> higher<00:04:26.240> up<00:04:26.270> in<00:04:26.930> the

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.140 
really because they're higher up in the

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.770 
really because they're higher up in the
range<00:04:27.380> and<00:04:27.710> I<00:04:28.430> just<00:04:28.790> can't<00:04:29.150> I<00:04:29.330> just<00:04:29.390> can't

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:29.780 
range and I just can't I just can't

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.590 
range and I just can't I just can't
emphasize<00:04:30.020> enough<00:04:30.320> that<00:04:30.800> they<00:04:30.919> sound

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
emphasize enough that they sound

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.740 
emphasize enough that they sound
absolutely<00:04:32.830> fantastic<00:04:33.830> now<00:04:34.490> we've<00:04:35.240> also<00:04:35.390> got
