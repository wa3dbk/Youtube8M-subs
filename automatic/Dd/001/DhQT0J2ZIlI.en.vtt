00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
but you can't really see it that well

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:41.980 
but you can't really see it that well
from<00:01:40.789> the<00:01:40.939> camera<00:01:41.270> I'm<00:01:41.359> sure<00:01:41.569> but<00:01:41.810> it's

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:49.969 
of it from a design standpoint is I

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:52.330 
of it from a design standpoint is I
think<00:01:50.029> it's<00:01:50.239> a<00:01:50.299> very<00:01:50.509> nice<00:01:51.200> looking<00:01:51.709> shoe<00:01:52.099> I

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:52.340 
think it's a very nice looking shoe I

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.219 
think it's a very nice looking shoe I
like<00:01:52.700> the<00:01:52.819> design<00:01:53.119> a<00:01:53.179> lot<00:01:53.450> I<00:01:53.749> think<00:01:53.929> it<00:01:54.049> has<00:01:54.200> a

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
like the design a lot I think it has a

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.099 
like the design a lot I think it has a
little<00:01:54.409> more<00:01:54.679> rugged<00:01:55.609> look<00:01:56.209> that<00:01:56.569> say<00:01:56.869> the

00:01:57.099 --> 00:01:57.109 
little more rugged look that say the

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:58.659 
little more rugged look that say the
Nike<00:01:57.649> Free<00:01:57.829> which<00:01:58.039> i<00:01:58.130> think<00:01:58.189> is<00:01:58.399> a<00:01:58.429> little<00:01:58.520> more

00:01:58.659 --> 00:01:58.669 
Nike Free which i think is a little more

00:01:58.669 --> 00:02:01.870 
Nike Free which i think is a little more

very uh surprisingly flat shoe it looks
like<00:02:18.150> a<00:02:18.180> traditional<00:02:18.540> shoe<00:02:18.689> it's<00:02:19.079> raised<00:02:19.319> but

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
like a traditional shoe it's raised but

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.500

the<00:02:19.709> thing<00:02:19.890> that<00:02:19.920> I<00:02:20.280> was<00:02:20.519> amazed<00:02:20.849> by<00:02:21.060> to<00:02:21.120> look

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
the thing that I was amazed by to look

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.149 
the thing that I was amazed by to look
at<00:02:21.689> it<00:02:21.870> when<00:02:22.409> it's<00:02:22.560> flat

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:23.159 
at it when it's flat

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:26.179 
at it when it's flat
that's<00:02:23.430> lease<00:02:23.640> it's<00:02:23.969> flat<00:02:24.900> and<00:02:25.260> where<00:02:26.010> your

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:26.189 
that's lease it's flat and where your

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:28.550 
that's lease it's flat and where your
heel<00:02:26.640> is<00:02:26.909> versus<00:02:27.420> where<00:02:27.569> your<00:02:27.750> forefoot<00:02:28.200> is<00:02:28.349> is

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
heel is versus where your forefoot is is

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.990 
heel is versus where your forefoot is is
actually<00:02:28.739> pretty<00:02:29.189> flat<00:02:29.519> so<00:02:29.549> when<00:02:29.909> you

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
actually pretty flat so when you

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.960 
actually pretty flat so when you
actually<00:02:30.120> run<00:02:30.659> it<00:02:31.260> feels<00:02:31.620> like<00:02:31.829> you<00:02:32.010> are<00:02:32.250> kind

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
actually run it feels like you are kind

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.490 
actually run it feels like you are kind
of<00:02:33.090> lying<00:02:33.239> barefoot<00:02:33.689> that<00:02:33.780> fee<00:02:33.989> it's<00:02:34.200> easier

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
of lying barefoot that fee it's easier

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.349 
of lying barefoot that fee it's easier
to<00:02:34.650> do<00:02:34.799> a<00:02:34.829> mid<00:02:35.129> stride<00:02:35.430> for<00:02:35.819> spread<00:02:36.150> type

in<00:03:11.939> these<00:03:12.120> actually<00:03:12.540> decided<00:03:12.900> to<00:03:12.989> run

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
in these actually decided to run

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.890 
in these actually decided to run
barefoot<00:03:13.980> might<00:03:14.939> be<00:03:15.120> one<00:03:15.329> out<00:03:15.389> there<00:03:15.449> but<00:03:15.659> with

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
barefoot might be one out there but with

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.640 
barefoot might be one out there but with
no<00:03:16.049> socks<00:03:16.379> and<00:03:16.829> I<00:03:17.489> realized<00:03:17.970> that<00:03:18.650> there's

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
no socks and I realized that there's

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.170 
no socks and I realized that there's
probably<00:03:19.859> not<00:03:19.949> a<00:03:20.010> good<00:03:20.190> idea<00:03:20.250> so<00:03:20.549> actually<00:03:21.030> on

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
probably not a good idea so actually on

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.789 
probably not a good idea so actually on
the<00:03:21.299> back<00:03:21.540> of<00:03:21.810> this<00:03:21.900> it's<00:03:22.139> kind<00:03:22.319> of<00:03:22.349> a<00:03:22.500> hard

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
the back of this it's kind of a hard

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.369 
the back of this it's kind of a hard
material<00:03:23.459> but<00:03:23.970> when<00:03:24.120> I<00:03:24.180> ran<00:03:24.449> without<00:03:24.959> any

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:25.379 
material but when I ran without any

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:28.009 
material but when I ran without any
socks<00:03:25.949> I<00:03:26.430> kind<00:03:27.269> of<00:03:27.329> gave<00:03:27.479> myself<00:03:27.599> a<00:03:27.870> little

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
socks I kind of gave myself a little

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.530 
socks I kind of gave myself a little
blister<00:03:28.470> in<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.620> fact<00:03:28.949> but<00:03:29.819> overall<00:03:30.150> it<00:03:30.449> was

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
blister in the fact but overall it was

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.479 
blister in the fact but overall it was
still<00:03:30.720> a<00:03:30.750> very<00:03:30.840> nice<00:03:31.319> comfortable<00:03:32.250> money

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
still a very nice comfortable money

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.399 
still a very nice comfortable money
experience<00:03:32.909> because<00:03:33.060> of<00:03:33.269> the<00:03:33.540> flat<00:03:33.959> nature

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:34.409 
experience because of the flat nature

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:36.020 
experience because of the flat nature
and<00:03:34.979> the<00:03:35.069> other<00:03:35.190> thing<00:03:35.340> I<00:03:35.430> noticed<00:03:35.489> so<00:03:36.000> far

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
and the other thing I noticed so far

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.809 
and the other thing I noticed so far
with<00:03:36.449> these<00:03:36.569> is<00:03:36.930> it's<00:03:37.409> it's<00:03:38.280> a<00:03:38.400> lot<00:03:38.579> more

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
with these is it's it's a lot more

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:40.610 
with these is it's it's a lot more
cushioning<00:03:39.569> so<00:03:39.930> I<00:03:39.989> was<00:03:40.079> able<00:03:40.260> to<00:03:40.290> actually<00:03:40.470> a

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
cushioning so I was able to actually a

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.920 
cushioning so I was able to actually a
little<00:03:41.040> farther<00:03:41.280> than<00:03:41.519> I<00:03:41.669> say<00:03:41.849> I<00:03:42.090> could<00:03:42.659> with

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
little farther than I say I could with

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.369 
little farther than I say I could with
