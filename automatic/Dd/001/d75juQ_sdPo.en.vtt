especially<00:00:27.750> for<00:00:27.900> them<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.470> that's<00:00:28.830> not<00:00:28.980> the

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
especially for them and that's not the

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.189 
especially for them and that's not the

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
case here are my ham and cheese

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:49.240 
case here are my ham and cheese
croissants<00:00:31.619> on<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.460> one<00:00:32.610> pot<00:00:32.820> chef

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.850 

now<00:00:50.250> it's<00:00:50.460> as<00:00:50.610> simple<00:00:50.820> as<00:00:51.059> taking<00:00:51.540> a<00:00:51.989> defrosted

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
now it's as simple as taking a defrosted

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.729 
now it's as simple as taking a defrosted
piece<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.400> the<00:00:53.760> puff<00:00:54.030> pastry<00:00:54.540> and<00:00:54.750> cutting

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
piece of the puff pastry and cutting

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.759 
piece of the puff pastry and cutting
diagonally<00:00:56.370> so<00:00:57.059> you've<00:00:57.210> got<00:00:57.420> two<00:00:57.769> big

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:58.769 
diagonally so you've got two big

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:11.600 
diagonally so you've got two big
triangles<00:00:59.610> just<00:01:01.220> like<00:01:02.220> that<00:01:09.560> now<00:01:10.560> with<00:01:10.920> the

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
triangles just like that now with the

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.020 
triangles just like that now with the
long<00:01:11.850> side<00:01:12.320> facing<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.729> what<00:01:14.729> you're<00:01:14.910> gonna

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
long side facing you what you're gonna

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.389 
long side facing you what you're gonna
do<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:15.570> you're<00:01:15.780> going<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:15.930> take<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.470> small<00:01:17.160> piece

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:17.399 
do is you're going to take a small piece

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:20.540 
do is you're going to take a small piece
of<00:01:17.610> ham<00:01:18.289> you<00:01:19.289> don't<00:01:19.530> need<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.710> lot<00:01:19.979> just<00:01:20.310> a

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
of ham you don't need a lot just a

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.999 
of ham you don't need a lot just a
little<00:01:20.789> bit<00:01:23.570> take<00:01:24.570> a<00:01:24.600> piece<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:25.020> ham<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.920> you

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
little bit take a piece of ham and you

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.680 
little bit take a piece of ham and you

give small piece of cheese and you sort
of<00:01:27.780> wrap<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.649> up<00:01:28.940> and<00:01:29.940> pop<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.270> in<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.570> middle

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
of wrap it up and pop it in the middle

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.300 
of wrap it up and pop it in the middle
like<00:01:30.960> so<00:01:31.220> and<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.940> basically<00:01:33.179> take<00:01:34.310> your

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
like so and you basically take your

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.620 
like so and you basically take your
pastry<00:01:35.550> and<00:01:36.149> you<00:01:36.990> gently<00:01:37.679> roll<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.160> over<00:01:38.630> like

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
pastry and you gently roll it over like

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.180 
pastry and you gently roll it over like
this<00:01:39.800> so<00:01:40.800> you've<00:01:40.950> got<00:01:41.160> a<00:01:41.190> bit<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.700> tube<00:01:42.060> going

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
this so you've got a bit of a tube going

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.930 
this so you've got a bit of a tube going
then<00:01:44.190> all<00:01:44.429> you<00:01:44.580> need<00:01:44.610> do<00:01:45.060> is<00:01:46.520> form<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.670> into<00:01:47.849> the

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
then all you need do is form it into the

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.350 
then all you need do is form it into the
shape<00:01:48.030> of<00:01:48.660> a<00:01:49.410> croissant<00:01:49.800> you<00:01:50.929> just<00:01:51.929> sort<00:01:52.080> of

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
shape of a croissant you just sort of

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.210 
shape of a croissant you just sort of
twist<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.569> ends<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:54.869> little<00:01:54.959> bit<00:01:55.140> like<00:01:55.410> that

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.410 

just<00:01:59.220> make<00:01:59.369> sure<00:01:59.580> if<00:01:59.759> you've<00:01:59.880> got<00:02:00.030> any<00:02:00.239> little

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
just make sure if you've got any little

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.859 
just make sure if you've got any little
gaps<00:02:01.009> that<00:02:02.009> they<00:02:02.250> just<00:02:02.910> pinch<00:02:03.599> together

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
gaps that they just pinch together

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.249 
gaps that they just pinch together
slightly<00:02:04.649> because<00:02:05.220> otherwise<00:02:05.849> all<00:02:06.420> your

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
slightly because otherwise all your

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.130 
slightly because otherwise all your
cheese<00:02:07.560> will<00:02:07.770> come<00:02:07.979> running<00:02:08.310> out<00:02:08.989> so<00:02:09.989> there

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
cheese will come running out so there

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.020 
cheese will come running out so there
you<00:02:10.229> go<00:02:10.470> that's<00:02:11.250> basically<00:02:11.670> what<00:02:11.880> we're

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
you go that's basically what we're

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.180 
you go that's basically what we're
looking<00:02:12.239> for<00:02:12.270> and<00:02:12.690> you<00:02:13.440> just<00:02:13.620> pop<00:02:13.830> it<00:02:13.860> onto

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
looking for and you just pop it onto

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.720 
looking for and you just pop it onto
your<00:02:14.280> tracks<00:02:16.040> and<00:02:17.040> you<00:02:17.069> move<00:02:17.310> on<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.610> next

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
your tracks and you move on to the next

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.300 
your tracks and you move on to the next
one<00:02:18.440> so<00:02:19.440> easy<00:02:19.860> isn't<00:02:20.160> it<00:02:21.050> so<00:02:22.050> just<00:02:22.950> repeat<00:02:23.190> the

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
one so easy isn't it so just repeat the

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.890 
one so easy isn't it so just repeat the
process<00:02:24.980> long<00:02:25.980> side<00:02:26.250> towards<00:02:26.670> you<00:02:26.790> get<00:02:27.690> your

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
process long side towards you get your

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.330 
process long side towards you get your
piece<00:02:28.050> of<00:02:28.230> ham<00:02:29.720> put<00:02:30.770> cheese<00:02:31.770> in<00:02:31.800> the<00:02:32.099> middle

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
piece of ham put cheese in the middle

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.030 
piece of ham put cheese in the middle
and<00:02:32.670> wrap<00:02:33.360> it<00:02:33.510> up<00:02:33.599> a<00:02:33.720> bit

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:42.589 

and<00:02:36.480> we<00:02:37.480> just<00:02:38.099> roll<00:02:39.099> over<00:02:39.480> make<00:02:40.480> YouTube

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599
