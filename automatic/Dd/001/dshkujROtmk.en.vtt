00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:14.629 
spotlight video this one is actually a

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:17.170 
spotlight video this one is actually a
remake<00:00:14.929> of<00:00:15.289> a<00:00:15.650> mod<00:00:15.889> spotlight<00:00:16.129> I<00:00:16.520> made<00:00:16.789> a<00:00:16.820> while

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:17.180 
remake of a mod spotlight I made a while

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.419 
remake of a mod spotlight I made a while
back<00:00:17.210> and<00:00:18.170> the<00:00:18.260> reason<00:00:18.410> why<00:00:18.619> I'm<00:00:18.740> remaking<00:00:19.099> it

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:19.429 
back and the reason why I'm remaking it

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:21.160 
back and the reason why I'm remaking it
is<00:00:19.550> because<00:00:19.849> I<00:00:19.880> don't<00:00:20.359> think<00:00:20.449> that<00:00:20.689> I<00:00:20.810> did<00:00:21.050> it

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:21.170 
is because I don't think that I did it

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.800 
is because I don't think that I did it
justice<00:00:21.619> I<00:00:21.859> didn't<00:00:22.460> really<00:00:22.789> fully<00:00:23.150> explain

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
are done pretty well for Minecraft

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:03.819 
are done pretty well for Minecraft
considering<00:01:03.019> everything's<00:01:03.350> made<00:01:03.500> of<00:01:03.530> blocks

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:03.829 
considering everything's made of blocks

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:06.850 
considering everything's made of blocks
and<00:01:04.190> the<00:01:04.760> animation<00:01:05.239> is<00:01:05.330> really<00:01:05.600> fluid<00:01:06.110> really

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
and the animation is really fluid really

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.190 
and the animation is really fluid really
nice<00:01:07.040> some<00:01:07.580> parts<00:01:07.909> a<00:01:08.090> little<00:01:08.270> bit<00:01:08.720> dirty<00:01:09.170> but

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
nice some parts a little bit dirty but

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.840 
nice some parts a little bit dirty but
you<00:01:09.439> can't<00:01:09.680> really<00:01:09.799> help<00:01:10.070> that<00:01:10.189> considering

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
you can't really help that considering

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.700 
you can't really help that considering
its<00:01:11.270> being<00:01:11.540> made<00:01:11.689> in<00:01:11.840> the<00:01:11.900> Minecraft<00:01:12.320> engine

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
its being made in the Minecraft engine

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.590 
its being made in the Minecraft engine
so<00:01:13.220> it's<00:01:13.369> done<00:01:13.549> really<00:01:13.850> well<00:01:13.970> for<00:01:14.119> itself<00:01:14.270> in

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
so it's done really well for itself in

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.170 
so it's done really well for itself in
my<00:01:14.689> opinion<00:01:14.960> all<00:01:15.369> the<00:01:16.369> animations<00:01:16.700> from

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
my opinion all the animations from

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.780 
my opinion all the animations from
jumping<00:01:17.689> flying<00:01:18.200> running<00:01:19.070> fighting

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790 
jumping flying running fighting

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.270 
jumping flying running fighting
everything<00:01:20.720> like<00:01:20.930> that<00:01:20.960> is<00:01:21.290> all<00:01:21.409> really<00:01:21.680> fluid

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
everything like that is all really fluid

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.810 
everything like that is all really fluid
and<00:01:22.430> seems<00:01:22.700> natural<00:01:24.100> there<00:01:25.100> are<00:01:25.220> a<00:01:25.250> few<00:01:25.520> minor

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
and seems natural there are a few minor

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.780 
and seems natural there are a few minor
things<00:01:26.000> which<00:01:26.509> kind<00:01:26.960> of<00:01:27.020> disappointed<00:01:27.590> me<00:01:27.790> you

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
things which kind of disappointed me you

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:29.740 
things which kind of disappointed me you
would<00:01:28.909> have<00:01:28.970> thought<00:01:29.030> that<00:01:29.180> if<00:01:29.450> you<00:01:29.479> were<00:01:29.600> a

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
would have thought that if you were a

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.200 
would have thought that if you were a
unicorn<00:01:30.350> your<00:01:30.920> character<00:01:31.610> will<00:01:31.640> be<00:01:31.850> able<00:01:31.939> to

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
that so it's a really nice feature in

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.840 
that so it's a really nice feature in
the<00:02:11.810> mod<00:02:12.070> creating<00:02:13.070> your<00:02:13.130> own<00:02:13.190> skins<00:02:13.580> is<00:02:13.820> a

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
the mod creating your own skins is a

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.559 
the mod creating your own skins is a
little<00:02:14.090> bit<00:02:14.210> complex

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
little bit complex

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.390 
little bit complex
but<00:02:15.810> there<00:02:16.260> is<00:02:16.290> programs<00:02:16.920> you<00:02:17.040> can<00:02:17.159> download

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
but there is programs you can download

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.520 
but there is programs you can download
to<00:02:17.819> make<00:02:18.209> it<00:02:18.329> a<00:02:18.359> lot<00:02:18.540> easier<00:02:18.569> like<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.260> skin

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
to make it a lot easier like the skin

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.080 
to make it a lot easier like the skin
decks<00:02:19.769> and<00:02:19.980> things<00:02:20.129> like<00:02:20.280> that<00:02:20.340> but<00:02:20.849> in<00:02:20.969> my

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
decks and things like that but in my

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.629 
decks and things like that but in my
opinion<00:02:21.209> the<00:02:21.810> skin<00:02:22.560> making<00:02:22.859> side<00:02:23.280> of<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.459> mod

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:23.639 
opinion the skin making side of the mod

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:25.599 
opinion the skin making side of the mod
could<00:02:23.849> be<00:02:23.969> a<00:02:23.999> lot<00:02:24.269> more<00:02:24.299> simpler<00:02:24.870> than<00:02:25.049> it<00:02:25.109> is

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:25.609 
could be a lot more simpler than it is

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:27.709 
could be a lot more simpler than it is
another<00:02:26.609> cool<00:02:26.819> thing<00:02:26.849> about<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.359> mod<00:02:27.540> is

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:27.719 
another cool thing about the mod is

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:29.360 
another cool thing about the mod is
there<00:02:27.900> is<00:02:27.989> armor<00:02:28.379> to<00:02:28.469> fit<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.739> pony<00:02:28.980> model

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
there is armor to fit the pony model

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.390 
there is armor to fit the pony model
same<00:02:29.879> as<00:02:30.120> leather<00:02:30.359> diamond<00:02:31.170> gold<00:02:31.709> I<00:02:32.069> and<00:02:32.280> all
