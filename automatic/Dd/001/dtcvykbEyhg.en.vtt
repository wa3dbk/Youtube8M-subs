00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:06.959
 in this video we will get a 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:09.030
 factoring from x to cube minus 5 and 

00:00:06.959 --> 00:00:12.030
 as we have as the first element of 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.240
 this subtraction a cube we are going to 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:19.680
 use the formula for the sum of 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:22.770
 cubes and if I told you sum of cubes 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.990
 because a subtraction can be put as a 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.350
 sum with the opposite can be expressed 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.150
 as a sum 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.800
 we will do it later in the first place 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.110
 we write the formula of the sum of 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.150
 cubes the first element that is the 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:38.260
 cube sanz second element that is the 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:42.040
 cube is by attention the way I have 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.530
 me to remember first factor the sum to 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.699
 rather 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.920
 and now the second factor is the sum of 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:53.550
 the squares to square 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:58.250
 more b square is simply signed 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.250
 less the product less ab 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.810
 practice the one bit you'll see how 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.210
 you write both times that you have to 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.040
 look at it you're going to write it good in 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.560
 our case as I say to apply it 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.830
 we need a sum then x to the cube 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:18.190
 minus 5 cousins â€‹â€‹as a sum x cube 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:21.060
 + less to get at least 5 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:24.730
 and now we need sum of cubes 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.290
 we have x cubed more we no longer need 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:30.970
 express at least 5 as a cube 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.370
 to get in less 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.950
 because less elevated to the cube is the 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.920
 odd exponent gives us less but for 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.049
 get 5 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.600
 what number multiplied three times by 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.460
 himself gives us five then a number 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.670
 integer does not exist that multiplied three 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:52.630
 times by itself of five however 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:55.869
 when raising the cube to get 5 we put 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:59.020
 the cubic root of 5 because because the 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:02.290
 Cubic root and the cube are staying 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:05.710
 only the 5 getting what we have in 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:09.729
 the previous step then this already 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:12.489
 we have written as sum of cubes the 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.230
 first element that is the cube is x the 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:18.069
 second element that is the cube is 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:21.400
 less cubic root of 5 and well let's 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:23.799
 use the formula that we have put there 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.129
 it is formulated says that we would have at first 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:31.299
 place as the first factor plus b our 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:36.730
 case of first plus the second x plus the 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:40.360
 second that is less cube root than 5 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:44.830
 and this multiplied by squared in 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:49.260
 this case x squared minus a by b - 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.260
 the first by the second 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.800
 careful more the square the second 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.620
 this case b squared when the 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:02.040
 second is less cube root than 5 it 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.180
 Write everything after we think high 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.830
 squared 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:08.530
 then this is obtained 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.770
 let's fix a little each one of 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:14.590
 these factors the first factor 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:19.400
 we would have x now more with less is 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:23.520
 minus 5 cubic net 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:28.670
 and now xx squared 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.670
 and now less less is more 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:34.130
 x cube root of 5 normally 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:37.760
 we write the number in front of the root 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:40.150
 cubic of 5 by x as has equal 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.580
 commutative property as we write 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.680
 as usual the number in front and 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.950
 now more 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:52.370
 and now we have this square where this 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.090
 squared the square of the less than 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.940
 we know it's more 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:00.360
 we will get one more as we do not put anything 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.910
 and now cube root of 5 squared the 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.430
 square can enter inside properties 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.940
 and then we can write cubic root 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:12.450
 5 squared but five squares 25 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:16.970
 and with this we obtain the factorization of 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.970
 x cube minus 5 desired
