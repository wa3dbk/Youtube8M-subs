00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
I think supposed to like line this up

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.880 
I think supposed to like line this up
and<00:03:11.250> then<00:03:11.370> I<00:03:12.170> don't<00:03:13.170> know<00:03:13.260> that's<00:03:13.530> pretty<00:03:13.739> cool

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
and then I don't know that's pretty cool

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.020 
and then I don't know that's pretty cool
though<00:03:14.040> so<00:03:14.280> I'm<00:03:14.400> gonna<00:03:14.489> probably<00:03:14.700> deal<00:03:14.970> with

strips<00:03:27.030> I<00:03:27.209> guess<00:03:27.420> and<00:03:27.720> then<00:03:28.620> this<00:03:29.400> is<00:03:29.519> a<00:03:29.579> game

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
strips I guess and then this is a game

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.670 
strips I guess and then this is a game
add-on<00:03:30.209> so<00:03:30.540> these<00:03:30.810> two<00:03:31.109> codes<00:03:31.290> on<00:03:31.410> the<00:03:31.500> back

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
add-on so these two codes on the back

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
add-on so these two codes on the back
this<00:03:32.400> is<00:03:33.230> Eleanor<00:03:34.230> The<00:03:34.470> Naked<00:03:34.620> City<00:03:34.980> then<00:03:35.340> and

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
this is Eleanor The Naked City then and

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.640 
this is Eleanor The Naked City then and
the<00:03:36.239> badge<00:03:36.540> pursuit<00:03:37.049> challenge<00:03:37.440> so<00:03:37.530> I<00:03:37.560> think

so disc one disc two and disc three so

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.900 
so disc one disc two and disc three so
that's<00:04:10.290> pretty<00:04:10.890> nasty<00:04:11.160> how<00:04:11.490> it<00:04:11.610> comes<00:04:11.760> with

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
that's pretty nasty how it comes with

that's pretty nasty how it comes with
three<00:04:12.030> discs<00:04:12.270> I<00:04:12.300> mean<00:04:12.420> that's<00:04:12.540> gonna<00:04:12.630> be

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
three discs I mean that's gonna be

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.740 
three discs I mean that's gonna be
annoying<00:04:12.960> squishing<00:04:13.320> this<00:04:13.410> out<00:04:13.590> but<00:04:14.340> I<00:04:14.370> mean

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
annoying squishing this out but I mean

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.240 
annoying squishing this out but I mean
pretty<00:04:15.750> sick<00:04:16.050> three<00:04:16.410> discs<00:04:16.680> I<00:04:16.739> guess<00:04:16.890> it's<00:04:17.040> big

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
everywhere I don't know hopefully that's

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.400 
everywhere I don't know hopefully that's
like<00:04:22.620> GTA<00:04:22.980> but<00:04:23.540> so<00:04:24.540> that's<00:04:24.630> it<00:04:24.840> guys<00:04:24.870> I<00:04:25.050> guess
