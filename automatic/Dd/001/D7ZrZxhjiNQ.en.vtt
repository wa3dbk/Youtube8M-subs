00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
over yourself oh yeah all right so I

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.740 
over yourself oh yeah all right so I
guess<00:02:11.620> this<00:02:11.769> is<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:11.950> zombie<00:02:12.370> killing<00:02:12.730> uh<00:02:12.760> sc5

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
guess this is the zombie killing uh sc5

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.470 
guess this is the zombie killing uh sc5

version how did the color schemes come

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.789 
version how did the color schemes come
to<00:02:16.569> be<00:02:16.690> but<00:02:16.900> what's<00:02:17.110> the<00:02:17.290> what's<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:17.530> idea

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:17.799 
to be but what's the what's the idea

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:19.979 
to be but what's the what's the idea
behind<00:02:17.860> there<00:02:18.220> the<00:02:18.819> idea<00:02:19.090> Jeff<00:02:19.480> loses<00:02:19.840> knife

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
behind there the idea Jeff loses knife

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:21.630 
behind there the idea Jeff loses knife
in<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:20.200> woods<00:02:20.379> or<00:02:20.560> something<00:02:20.680> I'm<00:02:21.250> gonna<00:02:21.400> see

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
it he might have I'm not sure the idea

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.699 
it he might have I'm not sure the idea
was<00:02:25.269> just<00:02:25.480> to<00:02:25.599> keep<00:02:25.900> it<00:02:26.080> as<00:02:26.230> visible<00:02:26.650> as

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
was just to keep it as visible as

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.759 
was just to keep it as visible as
possible<00:02:27.250> so<00:02:27.370> if<00:02:27.489> you<00:02:27.610> drop<00:02:27.849> it<00:02:27.879> somewhere

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
possible so if you drop it somewhere

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.540 
possible so if you drop it somewhere
even<00:02:29.769> the

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:31.550 
even the

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.670
