00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
white background is very light

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.780 
white background is very light
background<00:03:31.720> and<00:03:31.989> then<00:03:32.950> if<00:03:33.190> something<00:03:33.519> is

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
background and then if something is

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:34.770 
background and then if something is
behind<00:03:34.209> it

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
behind it

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.199

like<00:03:35.109> let's<00:03:35.590> just<00:03:35.680> say<00:03:36.100> a<00:03:36.280> picture<00:03:36.819> is<00:03:36.850> your

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
like let's just say a picture is your

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:40.590 
like let's just say a picture is your
background<00:03:37.450> you<00:03:37.840> will<00:03:37.959> still<00:03:38.530> see<00:03:39.040> it<00:03:39.329> so<00:03:40.329> if

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
background you will still see it so if

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.420 
background you will still see it so if
we<00:03:40.810> now<00:03:41.049> take<00:03:41.109> the<00:03:41.910> light<00:03:42.910> box<00:03:43.209> for<00:03:43.510> it<00:03:44.069> so<00:03:45.069> let

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
we now take the light box for it so let

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.809 
we now take the light box for it so let
us<00:03:45.459> just<00:03:45.609> stay<00:03:46.269> this<00:03:46.510> way<00:03:46.930> and<00:03:47.230> then<00:03:48.069> open<00:03:48.670> our
