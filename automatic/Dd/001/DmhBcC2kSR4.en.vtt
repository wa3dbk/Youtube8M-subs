00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:34.930
 we have 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.310
 although the cav is to determine the shakedown 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:23.439
 tell us a bit how this has been 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.570
 first contact with the adam r2 here in 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:27.970
 the asphalt of córdoba good because very 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.100
 Well, we've been testing things and little to 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.640
 little improving with a little more than 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.810
 Trust and good very comfortable is the 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.060
 first rally that you are going to do here in 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.399
 peninsula with this new car with the 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.229
 Adame r2 how you approach a bit this 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.840
 career after the previous baggage of 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:46.000
 canary good I think this rally is going 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.159
 to be very important to finish for 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.220
 we and our goal 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.530
 principal is going to be that 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.720
 and little by little can continue to improve in 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.100
 things that can be improved 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.740
 esteban catalá have been the sensations 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.890
 in the good shakedown well the truth is 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.620
 what 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:08.069
 happy we are still working in the 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:10.440
 car in adapt in adapting 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:14.180
 adapt the car and I to the new ones 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.470
 tires but good feelings apart 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.140
 times are good compared to 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.980
 those of last year even exhibited and 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.709
 well pleased what is working 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.420
 perfectly and well I think little to 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.280
 little we are taking little steps in this last 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.260
 last I think we were going a bit 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.630
 better and good well very happy the 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.630
 it really changes a lot mushrooms from the stretches 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.640
 from the Canary Islands here to those of Córdoba not 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:39.630
 too much because it 's a similar tour 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:42.209
 of wide roads with enough grip and 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.920
 alternate zones very fast or very slow 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:47.080
 then good what 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.870
 more or less you use in channels here it serves 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.120
 with small adaptations and other 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.940
 instead for the northern kings no longer 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.650
 from the low and such good changes 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.870
 a bit the thing because there is a lot of crossing 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.959
 a lot of gravel and others but good here 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.400
 Here is quite similar to Canary Islands 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.530
 after the misfortune of adeje come from 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.510
 win the rally Canary Islands to add 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.620
 your first victory of the season 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.110
 which is a bit the approach here 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.690
 for Córdoba 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.120
 our intention would be to win 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.880
 attacking from the beginning and see where 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.700
 we are and where are our rivals 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.800
 I think we know well the 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.330
 the race the rutometer is practically 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.560
 last year's with some change 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.569
 we have made a good day of 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.400
 acknowledgments 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.349
 well I have good feelings to 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.850
 respect and I think we can be 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:37.580
 competitive 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:40.220
 from here I wish I could repair it 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.170
 Luis Peláez who had an accident now 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:43.400
 they need and are working in the car 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.120
 I wish we were all 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.120
 tomorrow in career
