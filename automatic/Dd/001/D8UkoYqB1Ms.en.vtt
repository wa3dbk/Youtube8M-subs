know how to French twist and my arms get
tired<00:01:40.619> so<00:01:41.250> this<00:01:41.760> is<00:01:41.880> really<00:01:42.030> quick<00:01:42.330> it's<00:01:43.200> only

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
tired so this is really quick it's only

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.680 
tired so this is really quick it's only
literally<00:01:43.830> like<00:01:44.190> 20<00:01:44.400> seconds<00:01:45.000> so<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.600> might

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
literally like 20 seconds so it might

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:46.789 
literally like 20 seconds so it might
take<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.930> little<00:01:46.020> longer<00:01:46.200> if<00:01:46.440> your<00:01:46.560> hair<00:01:46.710> is

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
take a little longer if your hair is

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.469 
take a little longer if your hair is
longer<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.250> then<00:01:47.670> basically<00:01:47.970> what<00:01:48.150> you<00:01:48.240> do<00:01:48.360> is

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
longer and then basically what you do is

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.630 
longer and then basically what you do is
just<00:01:48.510> squish<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.619> braid<00:01:49.830> down<00:01:50.070> flatten

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
just squish the braid down flatten

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.219 
just squish the braid down flatten
flattening<00:01:51.210> on<00:01:51.360> it<00:01:51.510> and<00:01:51.659> flattening

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
flattening on it and flattening

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.760 
flattening on it and flattening
flattening<00:01:53.189> it<00:01:53.490> on<00:01:53.909> your<00:01:54.180> head<00:01:54.510> so<00:01:54.930> then<00:01:55.680> it

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
flattening it on your head so then it

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.830 
flattening it on your head so then it
comes<00:01:55.979> into<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.400> really<00:01:56.729> flat<00:01:57.030> little<00:01:57.210> bun<00:01:57.479> and

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
comes into a really flat little bun and

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.600 
comes into a really flat little bun and
then<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.500> take<00:01:58.710> some<00:01:58.740> magical<00:01:59.310> little<00:01:59.400> bobby

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
then you take some magical little bobby

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.469 
then you take some magical little bobby
pins<00:02:00.020> probably<00:02:01.020> need<00:02:01.200> only<00:02:01.439> about<00:02:02.330> three<00:02:03.330> on

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479
