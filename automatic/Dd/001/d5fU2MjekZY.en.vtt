 it will have finished updating during 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.640

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.259

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.659
 that's when you loose t she 's not 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.939

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.780
 connect to the net and network for lan 

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:51.640
 update the street so the shot is 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.109
 I will see after when I try to 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.880
 to throw mario kart it still needs a 

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:59.350
 update I had I had taken a 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:01.479
 game with so that's it then there nothing that 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.509
 reflect this is it's captain 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:07.810
 todd choose three hearts in fact step 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.580
 in mende and full of small full courses 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.780
 small internships or actually have to move 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.120
 levels 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.150
 it's really cool there's more than 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.709
 seventy compact stages and everything to 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.079
 to see that looks nice where basically 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.940
 reach the goal finally here is there 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:23.860
 a treasure is however growing and full 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.440
 stuff to do to dig unearthed 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:30.819
 in the brain the pashas I think is 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.290
 Nice to agree so my food should 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.510
 to be ready 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:37.440
 I think it's nice I'll try to 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:41.230
 see I say well I'll try to see 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:44.470
 if i can if i can stream and yes yeah 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.359
 normally I can not because 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.090
 I've seen this for a very long time 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:50.410
 it's a media approach to capture the 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.150
 consoles and as I had no 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.950
 console not bat I had a ps3 but I 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.389
 I'm never room in the end I 'm going 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.310
 try to see if I can capture them 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:58.709
 only thing is that I had three 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.630
 removals with this little thing 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:05.709
 so I have the case but I think 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:07.269
 I have more cables so boring so I 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.859
 will have to but if I can I will try 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.780
 of you stream is then not all of the 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:13.780
 mario kart or so it will be evenings 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.489
 in the evening it's not long enough when 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.290
 I will play there, I say good listen and 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.030
 why not why not play either 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.540
 with you either show it to you but 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.569
 first I want to train a little bit 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:27.010
 or just for captain blood 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:30.569
 to be funny maybe streamed 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:34.349
 schema we will see suddenly here it is 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.400
 20% the update to do I have no 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:37.109
 idea of ​​whether they are learning to 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.760
 others I have not if they have been 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:41.099
 intelligent in quotation marks and they have 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.650
 any package in a single update where 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:47.909
 is my bad kind 3 4 and 7 th well 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:49.730
 boring there so we 're not it I do not 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:53.819
 do not know and besides I wonder 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:57.930
 a little bit of what's the point 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:04:02.099
 that's what it is to put there a 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:06.959
 orders it does not seem to me at all 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:08.699
 in fact no it's not that at all I know 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.659
 not what it's good for it can tell me in 

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:13.849
 the comments in question certainly 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:15.810
 too much of what it is for I do not know 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:17.280
 if it is for this remote 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.220
 for myself I even failed when she is 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.239
 plugged she is charging so I have a little 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:29.009
 but no, but it can not be satan 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:32.130
 times I hold like this and yeah so 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:33.330
 that's the other way around actually it's 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:35.039
 like that I say like that 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.320
 how in fact I long that's how 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:42.120
 we're going to even have the little notch 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:43.320
 there for the hockey home so yes it's 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.620
 well it does not need to write it 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:51.479
 that's it and so besides I have that 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:53.610
 also so that I guess that these are 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:56.430
 little tricks to be able to put the 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.930
 wii 2 so do not lie down as she 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.009
 is the sum I'm going legislative wholesale 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.509
 I put them I can follow the myths 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:05.789
 basically I 'm saying that I have to see 

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:06.930
 So if you see I elect to not take it 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:08.729
 space is perfect and full of small 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.430
 express storage for video recorders 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:12.599
 dvd players video recorders my 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.699
 god i 'll be the only one to say that 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:17.169
 still VCR so for the most 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:19.580
 young people at the time are no dvd 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:21.410
 cdc big hide brushes 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:24.169
 cassette that was called vhs and yes 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:26.990
 and we emitted boom in a VCR 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:27.410
 so that to be able to read our films to 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.540
 the time 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:32.449
 and yes and yes at the time we when we 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:36.229
 watched a drunk movie put pause on 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:38.210

 some do not know you have to know 

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:30.620
 to be very careful and not his 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.780
 is not that this speech that does that the 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:34.310
 pay close attention to the prices barred the 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.840
 new prices only once a year 

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:37.099
 discount 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.050
 typical example because I have this is 

00:06:37.099 --> 00:06:40.729
 where I took my wii and where sometimes 

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:43.280
 can see some very interesting stuff from 

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:46.400
 style I lose less than a washing machine at 

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:48.349
 instead of 850 euros it costs 350 euros and 

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.669
 a stock of sick and all thank you 

00:06:48.349 --> 00:06:52.130
 cdiscount I take it right away 

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:53.599
 quickly visit by bus cdiscount who go 

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:56.630
 is that they put forward I would have 

00:06:53.599 --> 00:06:57.560
 more than 2:30 while you Belgians who 

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:01.310
 want to take their marks 

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:04.300
 when in fact when in fact you have 

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:04.300
 hurt I hurt 

00:07:05.059 --> 00:07:12.990
 when in fact tiger to tangier has 

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:14.430
 done when in fact if you 

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:15.889
 look at the price of the same the same 

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:18.059
 reference on another site 

00:07:15.889 --> 00:07:19.289
 it's the same price so there is not at all 

00:07:18.059 --> 00:07:22.889
 emergency there was not any my chang 

00:07:19.289 --> 00:07:24.719
 quan part where he does not have it's not because 

00:07:22.889 --> 00:07:25.860
 that they make prices of sick no 

00:07:24.719 --> 00:07:27.869
 is that everyone does at this 

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:31.319
 prelate is usually the cry that bar 

00:07:27.869 --> 00:07:33.629
 it's the price of the very first sale 

00:07:31.319 --> 00:07:35.430
 of the object is his the thing that he has five 

00:07:33.629 --> 00:07:37.349
 years so inevitably five years ago he 

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:38.520
 was worth wemmel and almost two or three 

00:07:37.349 --> 00:07:40.289
 times the normal price 

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.639
 at first when they will sell more 

00:07:40.289 --> 00:07:43.259
 expensive after with the years with the 

00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:45.120
 new model that is so it leaves 

00:07:43.259 --> 00:07:46.849
 So the price is just goof 

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:49.680
 that's just what do you mean 

00:07:46.849 --> 00:07:50.999
 this is I do not take myself for the 

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:54.839
 sees the station is paying attention and 

00:07:50.999 --> 00:07:56.520
