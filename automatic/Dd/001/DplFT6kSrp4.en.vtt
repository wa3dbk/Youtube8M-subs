00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
all the way around it makes it easier to

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.140

you do it all the same direction

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.350 
you do it all the same direction
oftentimes<00:02:20.120> your<00:02:20.330> curls<00:02:20.780> end<00:02:21.080> up<00:02:21.830> I<00:02:22.360> don't

oftentimes your curls end up I don't
know<00:02:23.420> the<00:02:23.540> best<00:02:23.750> way<00:02:23.870> to<00:02:24.020> describe<00:02:24.500> it<00:02:24.709> but

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
know the best way to describe it but

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.060 
know the best way to describe it but
they<00:02:24.950> fall<00:02:25.660> into<00:02:26.660> themselves<00:02:27.410> so<00:02:27.830> it's<00:02:27.860> like

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
they fall into themselves so it's like

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.230 
they fall into themselves so it's like
in<00:02:28.190> the<00:02:28.280> front<00:02:28.580> you<00:02:28.700> have<00:02:28.940> this<00:02:29.180> just<00:02:29.959> one<00:02:30.320> big

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
in the front you have this just one big

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.880 
in the front you have this just one big
curl<00:02:32.240> whichever<00:02:32.690> way<00:02:32.870> you<00:02:32.930> curled<00:02:33.410> it<00:02:33.590> all<00:02:33.709> the

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
curl whichever way you curled it all the

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.270 
curl whichever way you curled it all the
same<00:02:34.100> way<00:02:34.250> is<00:02:34.310> just<00:02:34.520> that<00:02:34.700> one<00:02:35.200> big<00:02:36.200> curl<00:02:36.560> where

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
same way is just that one big curl where

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.460 
same way is just that one big curl where
if<00:02:37.370> you<00:02:37.459> do<00:02:37.580> it<00:02:37.700> in<00:02:38.950> alternating<00:02:39.950> directions

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
if you do it in alternating directions

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.660 
if you do it in alternating directions
then<00:02:42.470> you<00:02:42.590> don't<00:02:42.800> get<00:02:42.980> that<00:02:43.010> you<00:02:43.400> get<00:02:43.550> is

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
then you don't get that you get is

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:50.520 
then you don't get that you get is
easier<00:02:44.030> to<00:02:44.060> get<00:02:44.180> a<00:02:44.239> more<00:02:44.840> tahsil<00:02:45.350> look

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.860 

and<00:02:50.680> my<00:02:51.490> hair<00:02:51.700> is<00:02:51.790> pretty<00:02:51.940> moisturized<00:02:52.569> but

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
and my hair is pretty moisturized but

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.380 
and my hair is pretty moisturized but
right<00:02:53.140> now<00:02:53.380> but<00:02:54.130> if<00:02:54.430> I<00:02:54.640> felt<00:02:54.880> like<00:02:55.000> it<00:02:55.120> needed

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
right now but if I felt like it needed

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.850 
right now but if I felt like it needed
it<00:02:55.810> then<00:02:55.959> I<00:02:56.050> would<00:02:56.200> either<00:02:56.350> put<00:02:57.160> some<00:02:58.860> light

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
it then I would either put some light

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:12.850 
it then I would either put some light
oil<00:03:00.040> on<00:03:00.550> it<00:03:00.580> or<00:03:01.590> a<00:03:02.590> leave-in<00:03:03.370> conditioner

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.280 

so<00:03:13.850> I'm<00:03:13.940> just<00:03:14.120> taking<00:03:14.450> a<00:03:14.540> piece<00:03:14.810> in<00:03:15.050> the

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
so I'm just taking a piece in the

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.320 
so I'm just taking a piece in the
background<00:03:15.770> and<00:03:18.400> I'm<00:03:19.400> going<00:03:19.580> to<00:03:19.730> now<00:03:19.850> use<00:03:19.910> the

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
background and I'm going to now use the

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.000 
background and I'm going to now use the
purple<00:03:20.750> rods<00:03:21.700> and<00:03:22.700> with<00:03:22.910> the<00:03:23.060> ends<00:03:23.570> I'm<00:03:24.440> just

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
purple rods and with the ends I'm just

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:31.560 
purple rods and with the ends I'm just
wrapping<00:03:25.250> it<00:03:25.550> around<00:03:27.850> and<00:03:28.850> then<00:03:29.590> rolling<00:03:30.590> it

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
wrapping it around and then rolling it

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:45.640 
wrapping it around and then rolling it
and<00:03:33.610> then<00:03:34.610> bending<00:03:34.970> the<00:03:35.180> ends<00:03:35.450> together

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:04:27.030 

and<00:03:45.890> alternate<00:03:46.849> these<00:03:47.090> as<00:03:47.299> well

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.020 

and<00:04:27.630> with<00:04:28.630> the<00:04:28.840> very<00:04:29.080> front<00:04:29.440> if<00:04:30.010> I<00:04:30.580> wanted<00:04:30.940> it

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
and with the very front if I wanted it

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.970 
and with the very front if I wanted it
to<00:04:31.210> be<00:04:31.330> a<00:04:31.360> tight<00:04:31.660> curl<00:04:32.020> then<00:04:32.350> I<00:04:32.440> will<00:04:32.590> put<00:04:32.770> it<00:04:32.800> on

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
to be a tight curl then I will put it on

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.350 
to be a tight curl then I will put it on
the<00:04:33.100> flexi<00:04:33.430> rod<00:04:33.580> but<00:04:33.730> i<00:04:33.790> don't<00:04:34.090> so<00:04:34.270> i'm

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
the flexi rod but i don't so i'm

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:55.730 
the flexi rod but i don't so i'm
actually<00:04:34.450> going<00:04:34.720> to<00:04:34.840> pin<00:04:35.050> curl<00:04:35.080> it

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.279 

like<00:04:56.370> that

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:58.289 
like that

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:27.230 
like that
and<00:04:59.289> then<00:04:59.469> do<00:04:59.709> the<00:04:59.829> same<00:04:59.860> thing<00:05:00.699> to<00:05:01.119> other<00:05:01.360> side

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.050 

in<00:05:28.080> the<00:05:28.349> beginning<00:05:28.470> it<00:05:29.310> was<00:05:29.759> kind<00:05:30.000> of

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
in the beginning it was kind of

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.140 
in the beginning it was kind of
difficult<00:05:30.240> for<00:05:30.720> me<00:05:30.870> to<00:05:31.190> get<00:05:32.190> the<00:05:32.340> rods<00:05:32.610> to<00:05:32.910> bend

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
difficult for me to get the rods to bend

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.820 
difficult for me to get the rods to bend
when<00:05:33.330> they<00:05:33.449> were<00:05:33.539> like<00:05:33.720> new<00:05:33.990> and<00:05:34.020> fresh<00:05:34.500> but

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
when they were like new and fresh but

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.779 
when they were like new and fresh but
now<00:05:35.039> that<00:05:35.250> I've<00:05:35.370> used<00:05:35.669> them<00:05:35.880> several<00:05:36.300> times<00:05:36.500> it

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:37.789 
now that I've used them several times it

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:44.510 
now that I've used them several times it
helps<00:05:38.789> the<00:05:38.880> process<00:05:39.120> go<00:05:39.750> a<00:05:39.780> lot<00:05:40.259> quicker<00:05:43.520> so

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
helps the process go a lot quicker so

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.999 
helps the process go a lot quicker so
that<00:05:44.699> it<00:05:44.880> doesn't<00:05:45.090> take<00:05:45.419> long<00:05:45.690> for<00:05:46.080> me<00:05:46.349> to<00:05:46.380> roll

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:47.009 
that it doesn't take long for me to roll

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:49.969 
that it doesn't take long for me to roll
my<00:05:47.190> hair<00:05:47.400> at<00:05:47.490> night<00:05:48.740> because<00:05:49.740> I<00:05:49.860> actually

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:49.979 
my hair at night because I actually

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:51.020 
my hair at night because I actually
don't<00:05:50.190> think<00:05:50.310> I'm<00:05:50.460> going<00:05:50.580> to<00:05:50.639> have<00:05:50.759> to<00:05:50.819> edit

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.030 
don't think I'm going to have to edit

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:52.370 
don't think I'm going to have to edit
this<00:05:51.270> video<00:05:51.479> I<00:05:51.660> think<00:05:51.780> it's<00:05:51.960> just<00:05:52.020> going<00:05:52.289> to<00:05:52.319> be

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 
this video I think it's just going to be

00:05:52.380 --> 00:06:13.470 
this video I think it's just going to be
under<00:05:52.680> 10<00:05:52.860> minutes

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:13.480 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.750 

and<00:06:13.600> if<00:06:14.290> you<00:06:14.470> didn't<00:06:14.770> really<00:06:15.220> like<00:06:15.400> my<00:06:15.520> hair

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:15.760 
and if you didn't really like my hair

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.900 
and if you didn't really like my hair
full<00:06:16.860> so<00:06:17.860> that's<00:06:18.010> why<00:06:18.160> I<00:06:18.190> put<00:06:18.370> it<00:06:18.460> on<00:06:18.550> this<00:06:18.730> many

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:18.910 
full so that's why I put it on this many

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:22.460 
full so that's why I put it on this many
rides<00:06:19.180> if<00:06:19.390> you<00:06:19.510> don't<00:06:20.290> want<00:06:20.680> your<00:06:20.950> hair<00:06:21.460> as

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:22.470 
rides if you don't want your hair as

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:28.760 
rides if you don't want your hair as
full<00:06:23.470> you<00:06:23.950> can<00:06:24.160> always<00:06:25.170> get<00:06:26.170> bigger<00:06:26.470> rods<00:06:27.190> and

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:28.770 
full you can always get bigger rods and

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:33.180 
full you can always get bigger rods and
not<00:06:29.770> put<00:06:30.100> as<00:06:30.310> many<00:06:30.640> in<00:06:30.880> your<00:06:31.060> hair<00:06:31.920> so<00:06:32.920> take

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:33.190 
not put as many in your hair so take

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:37.080 
not put as many in your hair so take
larger<00:06:33.790> sections<00:06:34.240> of<00:06:34.420> hair<00:06:35.250> and<00:06:36.250> use<00:06:36.760> fuel

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:37.090 
larger sections of hair and use fuel

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:56.420 
larger sections of hair and use fuel
rods

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:56.430 

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:58.430 

but<00:06:57.030> I<00:06:57.060> do<00:06:57.180> that<00:06:57.450> I<00:06:57.480> did<00:06:57.750> that<00:06:57.780> one<00:06:58.020> back<00:06:58.200> so<00:06:58.380> I'm

00:06:58.430 --> 00:06:58.440 
but I do that I did that one back so I'm

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:13.610 
but I do that I did that one back so I'm
going<00:06:58.620> to<00:06:58.680> do<00:06:58.800> this<00:06:58.950> one<00:06:59.100> forward

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:13.620 

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:17.130 

and<00:07:14.790> the<00:07:15.790> same<00:07:16.060> thing<00:07:16.360> with<00:07:16.480> the<00:07:16.510> pin<00:07:16.720> curl<00:07:16.990> on

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:17.140 
and the same thing with the pin curl on

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:46.390 
and the same thing with the pin curl on
this<00:07:17.320> side

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:46.400 

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.020 

and<00:07:46.490> that<00:07:47.210> is<00:07:47.360> how<00:07:47.540> I<00:07:47.570> roll<00:07:47.840> my<00:07:47.900> hair<00:07:48.199> at<00:07:48.290> night

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:49.030 
and that is how I roll my hair at night

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:52.030 
and that is how I roll my hair at night
