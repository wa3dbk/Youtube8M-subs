a hundred percent clear and to me a
really<00:00:54.870> good<00:00:55.250> organizational<00:00:56.250> structure<00:00:56.579> is

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
really good organizational structure is

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.939 
really good organizational structure is
one<00:00:57.600> where<00:00:57.870> somebody<00:00:58.559> who<00:00:58.620> doesn't<00:00:58.800> know

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
one where somebody who doesn't know

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.529 
one where somebody who doesn't know
anything<00:00:59.250> about<00:00:59.430> what<00:00:59.730> I'm<00:00:59.820> doing<00:01:00.120> here<00:01:00.329> can

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
reorganize this in order to group things

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.500 
reorganize this in order to group things
and<00:01:10.770> what<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:11.159> like<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.580> reorganize<00:01:12.060> things<00:01:12.090> one

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
and what I like to reorganize things one

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.300 
and what I like to reorganize things one
of<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.689> things<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:12.990> like<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.229> do<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.740> set<00:01:14.280> up

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
of the things I like to do is set up

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.609 
of the things I like to do is set up
broader<00:01:15.000> categories<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:15.930> put<00:01:16.170> more<00:01:16.409> things

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
broader categories and put more things

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.440 
broader categories and put more things
in<00:01:16.950> them<00:01:17.189> because<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.520> find<00:01:17.790> that<00:01:17.909> most<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.360> the

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
in them because I find that most of the

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.600 
in them because I find that most of the
time<00:01:18.659> you<00:01:19.229> can<00:01:19.470> search<00:01:19.710> with<00:01:19.950> them<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.369> find

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
time you can search with them to find

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.969 
time you can search with them to find
what<00:01:20.790> you're<00:01:20.939> looking<00:01:21.360> for<00:01:21.720> so<00:01:22.320> that's<00:01:22.830> what

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
what you're looking for so that's what

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.320 
what you're looking for so that's what
we're<00:01:23.070> going<00:01:23.159> to<00:01:23.250> do<00:01:23.340> here<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:24.060> first

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
we're going to do here and the first

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.840 
we're going to do here and the first
step<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.320> create<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:26.159> new<00:01:26.369> folder

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
step is to create the new folder

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.340 
step is to create the new folder
structure<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.450> we're<00:01:27.600> going<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.869> want<00:01:28.140> to

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
structure that we're going to want to

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.530 
structure that we're going to want to
see<00:01:28.619> so<00:01:29.220> right<00:01:29.520> at<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.759> level<00:01:30.119> where<00:01:30.390> I'm

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
see so right at the level where I'm

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.359 
see so right at the level where I'm
going<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.869> be<00:01:31.020> regrouping<00:01:31.680> everything<00:01:32.189> in

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
going to be regrouping everything in

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.460 
going to be regrouping everything in
this<00:01:32.850> case<00:01:33.119> right<00:01:33.420> here<00:01:33.450> on<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.780> free<00:01:34.020> webcast

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
this case right here on the free webcast

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.350

that<00:03:01.659> i<00:03:01.690> just<00:03:01.780> created<00:03:02.049> so<00:03:02.590> you'll<00:03:02.739> see

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
that i just created so you'll see

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.229 
that i just created so you'll see
exactly<00:03:03.010> what<00:03:03.459> this<00:03:03.579> looks<00:03:03.819> like<00:03:03.879> when<00:03:04.150> I'm

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
exactly what this looks like when I'm

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.589 
exactly what this looks like when I'm
finished<00:03:05.370> okay<00:03:06.370> so<00:03:06.430> now<00:03:06.730> you're<00:03:06.940> looking<00:03:07.120> at

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 
finished okay so now you're looking at

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:10.410 
finished okay so now you're looking at
the<00:03:07.900> reorganized<00:03:08.829> free<00:03:09.310> webcast<00:03:09.760> section<00:03:10.209> as

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
the reorganized free webcast section as

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.689 
the reorganized free webcast section as
you<00:03:10.569> can<00:03:10.750> see<00:03:10.930> this<00:03:11.139> is<00:03:11.319> much<00:03:11.530> easier<00:03:11.590> to<00:03:12.370> sort

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:12.699 
you can see this is much easier to sort

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:14.939 
you can see this is much easier to sort
of<00:03:12.849> digest<00:03:13.060> there's<00:03:13.660> a<00:03:13.750> lot<00:03:13.959> fewer<00:03:14.199> categories

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:14.949 
of digest there's a lot fewer categories

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:17.159 
of digest there's a lot fewer categories
and<00:03:15.220> it<00:03:15.400> makes<00:03:15.639> sense<00:03:15.879> now<00:03:16.180> I<00:03:16.209> know<00:03:16.419> this<00:03:16.930> is

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:17.169 
and it makes sense now I know this is

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:18.330 
and it makes sense now I know this is
where<00:03:17.290> i<00:03:17.379> go<00:03:17.530> to<00:03:17.590> look<00:03:17.799> for<00:03:17.980> quickbooks

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
where i go to look for quickbooks

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.520 
where i go to look for quickbooks
tutorials<00:03:18.849> i<00:03:19.030> also<00:03:19.569> created<00:03:19.870> one<00:03:20.260> called

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
tutorials i also created one called

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.170 
tutorials i also created one called
multiple<00:03:20.919> software<00:03:21.250> tutorials<00:03:22.030> because

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
multiple software tutorials because

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.670 
multiple software tutorials because
there<00:03:22.510> were<00:03:22.599> several<00:03:22.870> projects<00:03:23.440> that<00:03:23.560> i've

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
there were several projects that i've

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.559 
there were several projects that i've
done<00:03:23.919> that<00:03:24.099> deal<00:03:24.669> with<00:03:24.819> more<00:03:25.060> than<00:03:25.180> one<00:03:25.359> piece

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
done that deal with more than one piece

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:28.050 
done that deal with more than one piece
of<00:03:25.750> software<00:03:26.109> for<00:03:26.440> example<00:03:27.000> exporting<00:03:28.000> from

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
of software for example exporting from

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.240 
of software for example exporting from
excel<00:03:28.449> to<00:03:28.629> outlook<00:03:29.019> or<00:03:29.199> inserting<00:03:29.859> an<00:03:29.949> excel

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
excel to outlook or inserting an excel

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.670 
excel to outlook or inserting an excel
spreadsheet<00:03:30.280> in<00:03:30.879> the<00:03:31.030> powerpoint<00:03:31.720> so<00:03:32.019> it<00:03:32.410> made

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
spreadsheet in the powerpoint so it made

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.229 
spreadsheet in the powerpoint so it made
sense<00:03:32.709> they<00:03:33.160> have<00:03:33.310> one<00:03:33.549> for<00:03:33.790> multiple

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
sense they have one for multiple
