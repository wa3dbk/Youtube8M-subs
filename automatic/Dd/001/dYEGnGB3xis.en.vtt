00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
except this one doesn't hold your hair

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.680 
except this one doesn't hold your hair
it<00:02:09.619> doesn't<00:02:09.800> turn<00:02:09.950> your<00:02:10.190> way<00:02:10.369> which<00:02:11.239> is<00:02:11.420> good

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
it doesn't turn your way which is good

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.059 
it doesn't turn your way which is good
because<00:02:12.020> I<00:02:12.290> don't<00:02:12.380> think<00:02:12.500> you<00:02:12.830> would<00:02:13.040> want

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
because I don't think you would want

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.220 
because I don't think you would want
your<00:02:13.310> hair<00:02:13.580> white<00:02:13.970> and<00:02:14.660> that's<00:02:14.810> why<00:02:14.959> I<00:02:14.989> stopped

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
your hair white and that's why I stopped

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.780 
your hair white and that's why I stopped
using<00:02:15.410> the<00:02:15.620> gel<00:02:15.860> is<00:02:16.010> because<00:02:16.310> it<00:02:16.430> turned<00:02:16.670> on

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
using the gel is because it turned on

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.520 
using the gel is because it turned on
your<00:02:16.910> way<00:02:17.150> and<00:02:17.209> created<00:02:17.720> flakes<00:02:17.959> this<00:02:18.200> doesn't

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
your way and created flakes this doesn't

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.370 
your way and created flakes this doesn't
really<00:02:18.950> do<00:02:19.190> that<00:02:19.220> as<00:02:19.580> much<00:02:19.910> as<00:02:19.970> a<00:02:20.150> gel<00:02:20.450> and<00:02:20.989> I

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
really do that as much as a gel and I

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.660 
really do that as much as a gel and I
have<00:02:21.560> it<00:02:21.680> on<00:02:21.739> my<00:02:21.890> hair<00:02:22.100> now<00:02:22.310> and<00:02:23.320> it's<00:02:24.580> doing<00:02:25.580> a

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
have it on my hair now and it's doing a

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.370 
have it on my hair now and it's doing a
pretty<00:02:25.940> good<00:02:26.030> job<00:02:26.180> of<00:02:26.510> holding<00:02:26.630> it<00:02:26.900> down<00:02:27.080> I<00:02:27.110> had
