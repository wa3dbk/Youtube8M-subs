00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:08.860
 here it says that 2 times four thirds is 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:11.799
 equal to eight times gap now pauses 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.599
 video and think about what you should 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:16.209
 gap 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:19.390
 I imagine you have tried 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:22.210
 so now let's do it together 2 times 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:27.039
 four-thirds represents this 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:29.740
 like the same as if we rewrite mos 14 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:33.550
 about three is the same thing here 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:36.460
 2 times instead of writing four texts 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:39.670
 so I'll write like four texts 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:42.970
 It seems like repeating the same thing but I'm going 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.730
 write one-third four times one-third 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:49.180
 one third plus one third plus one 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:52.120
 third if we call each of these 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:55.870
 one-third we have four of them then we are 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:59.530
 four texts 2 times 41 texts is the 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:02.860
 same thing as 2 times 41 texts 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:08.860
 study how much this is going to be the same 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:10.750
 I'll just copy and paste this will be 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:15.640
 this twice 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:19.390
 and then this is a group of 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:24.640
 four times a third or a group of one 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:29.170
 of these 41 thirds and we have one more and we will 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.890
 add up to two times four 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.610
 texts 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.620
 Let's add, we got how much we have here. 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:42.190
 a lot of a text so let's count 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:45.159
 we all have 12345678 thirds to stay 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:49.920
 Of course we can ignore the parentheses 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:53.620
 and to add to that everything will become clearer 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:57.670
 I'll do it to make it clear that 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:59.799
 I took 8-thirds and added what is 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.119
 exactly the same here eight 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:09.219
 I'll delete these texts. 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:14.319
 this and this clearly this is hope 

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:17.530
 equal to eight times one third 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:21.730
 I have eight- thirds here. 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:24.879
 coming back to the question 2 times four 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.959
 thirds is the same as eight times one 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:28.989
 third 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:32.590
 we have already seen that eight times a third 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:36.609
 of 8/3 also gives to represent 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:40.180
 with 8 out of 3 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:44.459
 I'll write three with another color the 81 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.459
 over three
