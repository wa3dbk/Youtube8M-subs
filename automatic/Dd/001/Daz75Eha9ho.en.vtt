00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:06.690
 good to all welcome to a new 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.820
 video and this time, well, I have a 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.740
 little to teach the players as well 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.410
 bargain in quotes because you already know 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.269
 are many doubts on twitter all me 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.100
 comment on twitter about the market that 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.789
 I did not just hit that slump and in fact 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.310
 went up then 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:22.989
 I already told you if you do not follow me 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.970
 twitter I will continue because I put everything to 

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:26.410
 instant in the video and other good 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.599
 already indicated a bit then the players 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.509
 you want more but well I tell you 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:33.309
 the market can both go up and down 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:35.379
 this year is in fact being the most 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:39.780
 weird because whenever there is a whole 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:43.000
 any year in the fifa then it does not end 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.589
 does not just hit is that bass in this 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.479
 year and it 's weird because every year he hit 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:48.100
 a significant downturn until the 

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:50.350
 totti and in fact they have come out and has stuck 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.119
 a really high, that is, it went down a bit and 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.939
 then it's me because they are games that has 

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:58.089
 carried are much cheaper than 

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:59.559
 now in xbox you are seeing what xbox is 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:02.470
 do not tell me play prices and so on 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:04.329
 but good what I know is in xbox but 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.950
 well I know that in xbox in play as much as 

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:08.290
 in all the consoles because they have stuck a 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.880
 yours have not gone down yet where it does 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.130
 has begun to notice a bit of slump 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.560
 two but when they pulled out yesterday in the 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.990
 envelopes those of 50 that yesterday 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.270
 Tuesday and today with the team of the week 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.680
 that will come out and with new envelopes 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.140
 specials that you can take out then 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.850
 I think it's going to go down a bit more but 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.159
 When I do recommend that you have them already 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.140
 butt when more envelopes come out 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.090
 specials and leave the entire team that 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.189
 come out some pretty special envelopes 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.720
 that I think that they will take out there will be 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:37.060
 one with two lower properties will be 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.280
 but I do think that it will not be for 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.259
 nothing or at all I think they will be 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.729
 as low as other years other years 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:44.229
 They are very low but this year I do not think 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.630
 that go down as many as other years since 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:50.319
 this year then pages of coins and all 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.209
 these things then well as the people 

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:54.640
 You can have more coins by buying the 

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:56.740
 Well, how are people going to go 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.259
 players type jactar type royce type 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.399
 demaría and all these, of course, the 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.170
 people to have more coins as 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.330
 monopolist in those players if he does not 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.429
 that lower both the price so that 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.220
 that's a little explanation about why 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:11.709
 what the coins or the players do not 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.880
 are going down so much in price because 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.170
 that's how people have many more 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.849
 coins that in other fixed ones because the 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.459
 monopolist no 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:19.989
 and they have and therefore does not fall giving 

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.230
 pressure and they put where they did gas but 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:21.909
 good 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.290
 I take a few I will teach a 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:24.549
 little so do not forget so short 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.720
 because in the video I wanted to do it 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:28.750
 to explain what I get many 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.190
 Video 15 questions as before 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.379
 to explain is that when they buy and 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.090
 other then that video then it was my 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:36.519
 theory around another state you and I know 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.080
 what I said or when I saw that those who 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.370
 are lower as check ago 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.470
 Well, for example, you took me to Griezmann 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.910
 that I loved another one after wild is 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.650
 of griezmann of both the team of ries 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.540
 man as ocote team and that that other 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.090
 me that I have here this or coti and 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.000
 well another week also brings me to 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.560
 spend for 229 thousand are watching me 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.910
 is going great with the 7 games 8 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.099
 goals will also be school of the 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.879
 barclays also royce with six matches 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:59.739
 and it's good, it's also going 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:01.480
 quite well andrés you will have the 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.519
 squad with royce that comes accompanied 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.780
 of Griezmann are both in the same 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:07.790
 team and the truth that is going to me 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.219
 quite well those teams was would estimate 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.109
 Yaya toured the players so 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:13.459
 are quite touches have now influenced 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:16.219
 pretty but that day they were 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.450
 that day, as the coins or 

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:20.299
 be the players when lower 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.859
 They were usually look like 19 k 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:24.079
 players when cheaper were 

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:26.420
 the morning of that day and I'm telling you 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:29.359
 we wait for special envelopes or 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.879
 is the complete equipment so that 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:35.420
 coins the players end up hitting 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:37.849
 a downturn do not rush and when you see 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:38.959
 that things are going down a lot 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:41.180
 because of envelopes or because the equipment is 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.950
 concrete then launched if I bought there not 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.170
 you end up waiting as much as the 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.599
 another day like the one since they left 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.400
 the totti that you end up desperate and 

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:51.349
 done instead of going down as was 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.060
 doing so he caught and hit a rush 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:55.730
 since hit everything began to rise suddenly 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.379
 and Christian tar everything began to rise and 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.629
 went up a lot of Christian fact 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:01.099
 right now it's more expensive than it is that 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:03.290
 the normal thing is now more expensive Christian 

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:05.299
 of the normal of what has never been and 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.739
 that's why I'm telling you to wait 

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:08.450
 those special envelopes and this the 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:11.060
 complete equipment or this the front or 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.799
 there are 100k envelopes of cinca yes 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.240
 that makes it the image but they 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:16.760
 He said do not wait 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.260
 bargains of bargains of those that there are others 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.870
 years because I do not think it goes down so much 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.460
 something will go down and you can get us out 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.380
 your profile when it ends 12 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.300
 go up and get your profit yes 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.940
 will go down but will not go down as much as two 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:32.300
 years we got used to healthy do not expect that 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:34.730
 make a super super special download like this 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.950
 that when you see it goes down a bit 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:39.020
 the same as you can take profit 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.450
 then buy there and you will regret 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.280
 as I have done and that those are my 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.290
 lost experiences any doubt that 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.030
 you have everything you have that yes I do not 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.590
 I robben when you say you want me 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.990
 It was because I'm no soothsayer and indeed 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.460
 this caught me if so unprepared until 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.440
 that the market would not go down so much 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.000
 Well, I think that 's why, because 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.770
 are the pages of the whole world 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.150
 we can buy coins and everything 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.740
 the world then they can have monkeys that 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.540
 want power are monopolizing 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.820
 buying players and so on 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.770
 any doubt except that - I tell you 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.540
 least I have to robben when that is that 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.610
 will go up because I do not know I'm not 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:13.040
 I guess to know you already know any 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.720
 doubt anything else you have me 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.430
 you say the comments as always and 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.900
 nothing I hope you liked me 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:23.360
 I will show wilder 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:25.350
 the team then with to hunt good 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.400
 teams that I 'm going to bring you a lot 

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.680
 in teams because I'm testing 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.590
 equipped also with silver with 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.270
 I love in the always concept id when it costs 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.190
 lots of equipment that I am doing 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.530
 better equipment then quite cheap with 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.300
 this semi-descent the other day and now 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.949
 Well, when happy hours and others leave 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.600
 shopping for more things and I'll open by 

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:45.780
 twitter actually follow me on twitter 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.610
 because that's when I say more if it's going to 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.229
 see me when there's a downer when I go 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.880
 to start buying xavi on the 

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:52.470
 another day then in fact when I started 

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.270
 buy what he said on twitter a couple of 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.160
 writers and others who also 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.990
 will point to buy then also do 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.610
 they got it right because then they started going up 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.310
 the ropes and other 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:05.699
 and I tell you there to follow me I also do 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:07.409
 raffles of all kinds of draws of 100 

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:09.960
 that there we were even trending topic 

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:12.360
 in Spain so good nothing else 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.099

00:06:17.219 --> 00:06:20.969

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:26.090
