00:00:03.479 --> 00:00:06.710
 Panasonic 3D Compact Digital Camera 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.000
 We exhibited "3D1" in CP + 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.889
 3D1 from 12 mega MOS sensor and 25 mm wide angle 

00:00:16.889 --> 00:00:19.700
 Lens which can photograph to optical 4 times zoom 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.009
 It is equipped with two 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:25.409
 The engine has four CPUs 

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:27.609
 Large-capacity full high-definition video 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:29.739
 It can be processed at high speed 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:32.830
 One conventional lens by power saving 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.369
 Equivalent to a machine with a sensor 

00:00:34.369 --> 00:00:37.949
 Achieves battery life 

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:43.480
 Two lenses and a sensor this time 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.109
 In being installed 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:46.360
 Two cameras 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.009
 Like being integrated 

00:00:48.009 --> 00:00:49.600
 Because it is an image 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.110
 Each lens and sensor 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.409
 Do each operation 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:56.150
 It can be said that 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.689
 Please take a picture of one side wide 

00:00:58.689 --> 00:01:00.040
 Zoom in on the other side 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.529
 Such usage is also 

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:03.359
 I can do it 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.600
 Because this one is the active screen 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.300
 Large screen zoom and such operations 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.309
 You can receive it and this one 

00:01:13.309 --> 00:01:16.560
 Touch and zoom 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.229
 Because you can do post-sales 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.130
 You can take pictures at different angles of view. 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.190
 When the shutter release button is pressed in this state 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.389
 I'm taking two pictures at the same time 

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:35.490
 If you see later, 2 sheets at the same time 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.380
 You will be ready to shoot 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.400
 When shooting 2D video, use the other as a photo 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.719
 It is also possible to record 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:47.020
 Also at this time video and photo respectively 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.169
 Change the angle of view and shoot 

00:01:50.169 --> 00:01:52.330
 LCD on the back is 3D content 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.330
 I shot it because it does not correspond 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.729
 3D TV is required to watch 3D 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.779
 Yes you are using 3D TV 

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:06.460
 For those who already enjoy 3D movies 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.230
 As private content 

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:11.400
 Take your own child or something of your hobbies 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.080
 Have fun on the big screen 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.510
 It will be one way to enjoy 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.880
 The rest is not only 3D but also 2D fun 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.600
 It is more by getting it used 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.000
 Let me suggest how to enjoy your photos 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.110
 I think if you can
