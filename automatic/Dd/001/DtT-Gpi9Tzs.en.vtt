00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.740
 and as we are curious or seven days we 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.420
 had avoided or vocal reflection of 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.420
 charles gregory office show 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.890
 as you promise us all a 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.689
 show at the capitol I want to know 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.199

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:37.390
 parties by tdf to which family this is 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:39.460
 sure that the family is the must there 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.180
 have children needs to be the 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.890
 snow 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.210
 we must get out of gold given moment 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.650
 but I like that when concert slip or 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.360
 something happens in the end 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.129
 evening that must end 415 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.600

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:51.400
 table and gordon in the living room aps 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.710
 girls chatter between this time you 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.120
 I take an early bed so they 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.100
 ideal part of me that would be what is 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.629
 to save until 3 am and 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.280
 that the whole family may stay 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:02.079
 calmly grandpa I will accept that 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.820
 you go to bed but otherwise we 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:05.710
 left ideal it really is a go 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.200
 in song party that everyone 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.520
 flaw that this is a dance that must be said 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.229
 that me a drape of the aicf really 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.280
 happy i like to do it all because 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.979
 to find out I find that a storm 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.490
 of snow it creates a rapprochement at 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:17.200
 everybody 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.720
 it's everybody feels a little bit 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.450
 Danger is everyone wants to 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.039
 somehow protect everyone 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.630
 is fucking you are missing and that 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:27.430
 current or in haiti everything is 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.960

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.829
 christmas party in a snowstorm 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.689
 I think this ideal with a family 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:37.479
 my friends gather all this world 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:39.390
 all this would be really the top of the 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.500
 utopia top they were no less 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.079
 as it is done in my family it is 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.659
 really gone where everyone changes 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:47.649
 the world really danced but at home 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.110
 that's how it happens to all 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:52.030

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.799

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:58.869

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.090

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.820

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:13.600

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.050

 to green games have the impression that I 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.600

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.550
 that I would like to ask you that this 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.440

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.110
 evening was leaving I asked to have 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.850

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.980

 asked then to my parents I told them 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.120
 nothing asked either I think and 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:29.300
 mottois the egotism game how to bridge 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.800
 this material but I 'm good at my 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.700

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.410
 which is important is the one at 100 and 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:54.050
