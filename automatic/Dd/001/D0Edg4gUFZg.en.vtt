00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.069
 they exist in this city 

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:28.649
 Sunday the day arrived here to learn about transportation planning 

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:31.659
 public so you have this city to celebrate 

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:32.539

00:00:32.539 --> 00:00:35.870
 despite the 33

 it's hot that here curitiba is known as the coldest capital in 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.030
 Brazil, its transportation system is so deficient that many people arrive 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.190
 here funds to know it the population of curitiba moves to 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.590
 through an integrated transport network that divides the concentration 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.080
 from the public in 23 terminal 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.670

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.570
 a cross between the population to the terminals and this is consistent in that 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.110
 I was zabaleta

 the buses travel from north to south 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.160
 from south to north from east to west they travel between their established schedules and only 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.530
 pick up the passengers at the assigned stops the villagers are also 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.990
 part of this successful system was the traffic regulations respect one 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.700
 reality different from that of our country 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.120
 all this in turn to have data for these visitors 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.760

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.400
 and here but what other decisions does it take? 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.349
 a certain way is what pays a goose 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:15.590
 my career is long 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.590

00:02:31.649 --> 00:02:34.439
 during the administration of the governor jaime lerner 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:37.489
 twenty years after Curitiba began to grow 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.659
 The string of engineering and planning of the roads allowed one of the 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:46.379
 cities with the greatest expansion of Brazil at that time can be extended without 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:47.250

 here they call it the surface meter there are specific avenues for the 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.780
 public transport and others for private transport, for example 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.910
 great roads like Republic of Argentina the vehicles move in 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.390
 one direction here can be observed as in the distribution of the lanes 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.289
 this resembles our express way
