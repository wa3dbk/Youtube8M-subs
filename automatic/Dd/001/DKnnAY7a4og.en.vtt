00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:03.940
 but now we have to invite first to take off with us if I have one last 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.590
 if he says so much Schick 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:10.210
 the jeckens can paragliders and hang gliders around now in the air 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.760
 go and be accompanied by Appen since her last accompanies her 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.760
 last heavenly trip 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.890
 also Gates flat land near Itzehoe 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.259
 At 50 kilometers per hour, the wind pulls on the paraglider and stops 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:32.330
 4 not 9 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.510
 This objection has pilot and passengers will then have the fare at 600 meters 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.179
 drawn 

00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:40.179
 Now the holder has to be loosened 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.840
 In free flight, the two try to arrive against the strong wind 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.080
 The pilot promises a gentle landing 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.700
 v 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.130
 often a special team 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.740
 he was allowed to lie on top 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.030
 a little further over the airfield hungry wolf b too high 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.540
 sends a hang glider 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.310
 These aircraft are becoming rarer in the process, they are not among the topics I find 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.260
 the slide rails 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.380
 he is also Ghani Baradar 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.830
 the clear only a few food is in its original form for training 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.330
 that is flying 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.780
 Trigami 7 7 is unique and one way or the other 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.220
 it is much nicer 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.290
 but now only a sporty of the list of junior preferred 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.270
 paraglider 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.150
 the preparation for kite flying is elaborate equipment like the altimeter 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.320
 need to be mounted 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.930
 the 40-kilo-heavy dragons are set up meticulously Pilot Dieter Deventer 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.930
 has been doing well for almost 20 years 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.510
 I know that we can do it and go 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.160
 Freedom means 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.720
 I 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.100
 4 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.040
 change money 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.730
 but the work he can no longer clearly think one quite comfortable retirees 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.140
 me even if I would be so 2000 meters 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.989
 by the way, what do you do 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.929
 then it's really shaken up 

00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:14.009
 r 

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:15.189
 for all of us 

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:17.939
 begin 

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:21.549
 only a few are at the end of the season the Hamburg kite and 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:23.149
 Paragliders have come 

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:27.139
 Even beginners will Meineke has respect for the strong wind in many as well 

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:29.679
 because I was nervous sounding off 

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:32.099
 Successful but I think we do 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.590
 At least 50 flights need a pilot 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.590
 to fly a kite or paraglider alone 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.640
 "He'll have to say for sure that you know that, and that's the deed 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:50.159
 the much lower 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:52.939
 become the Belgian 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:57.029
 George has already flown alone but the wind has just started 

00:02:57.029 --> 00:02:57.839
 view 

00:02:57.839 --> 00:03:00.839
 the optimally sequel for ne-yo Afrojack 

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:03.489
 till 8 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:04.799
 Tires and axles 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:05.610
 from 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:06.909
 Been a flight instructor 

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:10.349
 Dr Canada was advisable to stand on the side 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:11.590
 everything OK 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.559
 not wet quite feasible 

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:15.690
 Max Otte me up 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.480
 Wegmann commits everything clearly that he has done that right at the start places 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.480
 Well 

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:27.029
 First, the two two and a half miles long ropes to the offshoots 

00:03:27.029 --> 00:03:28.829
 be returned 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:31.979
 here on the plates land the drone winch nothing at all 

00:03:36.369 --> 00:03:39.979
 we have to wait and see what was going on and the supervisor of what 

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:41.199
 on a photo 

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:44.119
 but the winter has moved very little feeling 

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:45.759
 the overflight 

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:48.759
 I was there 

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:52.130
 just a few steps and the flight 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.130
 starting 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:03.069
 Hundreds of meters below him on the ground they were the flight instructor accent 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:06.489
 I realized that I did not have any doubts about the way into the waters 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:08.899
 not quite as strong as on the way up 

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:10.549
 Concrete is already from the beginning 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:12.689
 that took up space 

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:14.569
 really the reverse 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:17.779
 the landing always a delicate moment Â» 

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:19.389
 Ron Howard 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:22.389
 DAPD 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.330
 that included hundreds of feet out the door 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.629
 but a wellness center folk is coming 

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:32.629
 on his flight 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.720
 a last start into the setting sun and then she is over this 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.689
 Seeds of hamburger kite and paragliders 

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:43.520
 he is back in April they are coming back to heaven so exactly
