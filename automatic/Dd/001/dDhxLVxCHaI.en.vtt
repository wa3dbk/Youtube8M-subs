00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.060
 name is cristian luna I am from Mexico 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:31.400
 my question is that food supplement 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.410
 take to decrease cortisol and 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.590
 also to increase the levels of 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:39.470
 testosterone and also how to decrease 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.650
 creatinine levels thank you very much 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.650
 raul 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.470
 good christian 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.020
 to inhibit cortisol levels the 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.970
 most common food has known me are 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.589
 the carbohydrates in this case high 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.240
 glycemic index sar have created a peak 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.000
 of insulin that will not inhibit the 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.540
 cortisol we have supplements rich in 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.790
 zinc and hills and celine that we also 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.100
 will help decrease cortisol a 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.290
 economic way to get these 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.600
 nutrients is taking the discipline of 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.800
 soybeans before sleep or in the morning 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.220
 when we get up 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.690
 you tell me that also what foods do you 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.730
 can help increase external ones 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.590
 good the best food that you can 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.210
 help keep raising the levels of 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.300
 Testosterone is consuming egg yolks 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.760
 a day my recommendation is that at least 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.950
 two buds consume the egg yolks 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.530
 eggs inside breakfasts and two other 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.900
 egg yolks at dinner or before 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.310
 sleep to lower the levels of 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:52.960
 creatinine my advice is to drink 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.170
 plentiful water especially between meals 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.090
 and space is all that the 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.410
 amount of proteins from both 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.340
 supplements like solid food 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.340
 during the day 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.650
 if not 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.650
 to
