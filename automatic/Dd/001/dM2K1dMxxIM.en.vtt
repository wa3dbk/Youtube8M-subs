 natural fenosa brings for you to 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:24.339

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:29.679
 less is to use it well well what are we going to 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.269
 make a super mandarin cake today 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:33.910
 quick to do in two minutes when 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:37.240
 people come suddenly and we have nothing 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:39.880
 good the blender 45 ingredients and the 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.800
 we have list then we have 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.930
 tangerines can be orange lemon 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.410
 of what you want I will cut 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.030
 they are super well washed and they go with 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:53.110
 husks and we will process them with 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:57.310
 shell then let's cut 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:59.250
 well juicy we are going to cut them in 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.890
 rooms 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.690
 we take out the seeds if you have if not 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.300
 has seeds directly to the blender 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.340
 we process a little we are going to open here the 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.450
 tapita and let's add here I have 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:16.120
 oil if a cup of sunflower oil 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:19.200
 Y 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.200
 to go to tempt 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.130
 very good that we are going to add more 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.500
 liquid 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.580
 I have the double eggs here 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.580
 we are also going to add them 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:39.430
 very good now we come with sugar sugar 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.950
 common let's get the good cap off yeah 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:47.760
 because already this is not going to reach 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.760
 we put all the sugar in that way 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.450
 this is there and we press it back 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.400
 we have to achieve an emulsion is already 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.310
 ready now let's integrate the dry 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:07.810
 that only flour 40 is normal and now 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:10.270
 we are going to overturn what this preparation 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.800
 and with a beater we will finish 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.530
 integrate where we are going to cook 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.530
 we can use it as cake or as 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:20.110
 square as solid then I would 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.599
 I have presented in the final product 1 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.489
 round as if it were a cake and if not 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:27.090
 cut into squares that can be a 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:30.640
 Square mold, buttered and floured 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:33.519
 so and then when it's already cold what 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.400
 here I have a short waist paper 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:38.590
 aluminum with butter and flour 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.769
 to go adding the preparation to go 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.769
 something 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:51.030
 couple on the surface 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:53.210
 and there we are going to go to an oven of 180 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.210
 degrees 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.400
 it is super super creamy has the 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.099
 pieces of fruit tangerine that 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:06.130
 you choose and we will go to the oven 180 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:10.530
 degrees for approximately 30 to 35 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.530
 minutes of a big piece if we go 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.049
 there we are well we keep the cake not 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.790
 we open it up plus another tip that gives us 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:21.280
 natural gas fenosa on the use 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.930
 responsible is to open the oven at least 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.879
 possible and the least amount of times 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.879
 possible so that we do not lose the heat 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.010
 we have ready the cake passed the 35 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:37.830
 minutes as I finish it with a class 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.900
 super easy tangerine juice 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.340
 impalpable sugar we mix it and I 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.010
 We overturn and already have it 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.829
 list so I hope they do it is very 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.019
 easy it's very rich and it's very humid like that 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:51.120
 prepare this cake and we 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.709
 we see in the next recipe that gas 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.019
 Natural fenosa has preparations for 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.829
