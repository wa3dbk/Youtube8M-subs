 and not like the mac in brie under the par 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.610
 sometimes even she made my friend billy t 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.440
 he's beaten in it's always after that 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:06.080
 o'connell all that results but 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:09.170
 had soon now been shown a 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.510
 good coach since this five-year 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:16.040
 victim admire these ten years 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:18.590
 all the same and clever atréia but not 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.810
 facilitated the easy task detach me 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.580
 develop it still shows size 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.150
 that we prepare the team is concerned 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:30.530
 did not even have a year after that 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:33.519
 it was the lazy you tube or 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:37.519
 bases and hands so my avatar who 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:41.510
 then turned out well but all and 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:43.519
 really ripped all and niko that 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.430
 helped me out so that we to mason the 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:48.859
 Catalans but it's the organization 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.260
 often to the channel and to all their 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:53.239
 states let's listen 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.560
 the person himself at Florent ibengué 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:56.560
 micro son as big as 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:03.320
 let's say we are discussing 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.500
 still so it's not done yet but 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:11.280
 despite everything the federation asked me to 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:14.640
 to take care of the national team for 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.990
 the matches that will happen so that's 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.700
 still a nice satisfaction I 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:20.310
 believe that it rewards the work that 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:24.180
 I could do within the club ace 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:27.510
 so thanks so to the federation and then 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:29.070
 especially congratulations and would be to be 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.130
 a great pride for all the experiences 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:34.380
 start well by azac papac the 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:37.710
 general himself and a big thank you to 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:40.310
 players who could bring the club where 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.630
 he is actually 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.250
 so now when we are not 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.320
 still happened a year continue to 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.910
 good work but I think it is 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.050
 the reward for that work so 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:53.370
 big thank you to all the family Veryant 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.110
 yes good it's not the first time 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.740
 it happens in the world but it's true 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.990
 that it is 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.900
 it's hard to combine the two 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:03.090
 but it's happened 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:08.490
 it's already happened what happens in 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:10.650
 this short term is that dates do not 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.030
 are not the same so we have the dates 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.639
 which overlap 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.290
 so we can do both for 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:19.390
 the moment so it will not ask a lot of 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:21.650
 problems to do so 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:23.720
 for now there is no problem I 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:26.390
 know that a lot of people talked a lot 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:28.310
 compared to that but me in my 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:32.090
 mind I want to hand over the team 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:33.410
 national over the whole team 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.180
 national must be for a player 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:37.730
 the culmination is to be the ultimate 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:40.990
 it does not have to be something or there 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:43.790
 go with the lead feet but that's 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.750
 it's really the pinnacle of a career 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:46.700
 for a player 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:49.160
 so if you see you look good 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:51.170
 in this list and I could have even 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.390
 to make a bigger one simply 

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:54.980
 is that but I wanted to raise awareness 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:57.770
 a little bit everyone including 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:59.930
 all our expatriate players who know that 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.820
 they have the opportunity to play no 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.160
 only in the country where they live 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.630
 also they have a second country 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.170
 is there who is ready also to 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:07.730
 to welcome 

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:11.300
 if they perform well 

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:14.050
 obviously so it's an open door 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:16.760
 to everyone so we can 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:21.140
 improve our national team well 

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:23.480
 sure i know without this no it jas 

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:26.510
 but I did it on purpose to take everything 

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:28.310
 this especially young people including 

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:29.990
 young people just started to their 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.550
 talk who may be able to come 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:34.160
 easily because we have a great 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:35.750
 competition here at the country level this is 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.570
 the under-23 competition 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:40.370
 so there are many under 23 years old 

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:41.870
 in this list it is for precisely 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:43.040
 take them to come play this 

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:45.710
 competition that's why I 

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.330
 expanded this list to the maximum at all 

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:48.590
 players who play at the biggest 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.150
 championship that is to say that you 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.770
 look in first division in 

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:54.050
 belgium on first division in france 

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:56.630
 in first division england 1st or 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:57.670
 2nd division especially for these young people 

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:00.070
 who can come 

00:06:57.670 --> 00:07:02.680
 give a very important hand 

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:05.530
 for this competition we are going to prepare 

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:09.060
 to win everything at kong score the super 

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:09.060
 fill in all its splendor
