this was a really nice red that will
last<00:00:14.670> forever<00:00:15.210> so<00:00:15.900> I<00:00:16.379> wanted<00:00:16.410> to<00:00:16.770> try<00:00:16.920> it<00:00:16.949> for

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.400 
last forever so I wanted to try it for
myself<00:00:17.250> because<00:00:17.760> I<00:00:18.000> don't<00:00:18.060> have<00:00:18.420> any<00:00:18.690> like

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
myself because I don't have any like

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
to last pretty much the whole day

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.050 
to last pretty much the whole day
because<00:00:25.170> it<00:00:25.289> does<00:00:25.470> contain<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:26.099> lip<00:00:26.490> color<00:00:26.730> as

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060
