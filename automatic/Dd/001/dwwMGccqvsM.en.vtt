what<00:02:23.069> white<00:02:23.280> wings<00:02:23.519> talking<00:02:23.939> about<00:02:24.170> why<00:02:25.170> is

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
what white wings talking about why is

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.770 
what white wings talking about why is
Suzie<00:02:26.370> building<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:26.819> buildings<00:02:27.180> over<00:02:27.420> here

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
Suzie building the buildings over here

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.080 
Suzie building the buildings over here
and<00:02:27.900> that<00:02:28.349> is<00:02:28.560> because<00:02:28.769> of<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.400> cannon<00:02:29.879> rush

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
and that is because of the cannon rush

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.830 
and that is because of the cannon rush
that<00:02:30.359> was<00:02:30.480> made<00:02:30.780> infamous<00:02:31.230> by<00:02:31.560> gauzy<00:02:32.840> the

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
that was made infamous by gauzy the

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.229 
that was made infamous by gauzy the
Protoss<00:02:34.470> player<00:02:34.709> who<00:02:34.950> can<00:02:35.250> in<00:02:35.400> Russia's<00:02:35.670> every

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
Protoss player who can in Russia's every

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.170 
Protoss player who can in Russia's every
single<00:02:36.810> game<00:02:37.140> and<00:02:37.530> I<00:02:37.980> mean<00:02:38.159> like<00:02:38.280> every<00:02:38.849> game

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
single game and I mean like every game

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.780 
single game and I mean like every game
just<00:02:39.510> about<00:02:39.780> he<00:02:40.139> always<00:02:40.560> chooses<00:02:40.799> at<00:02:41.189> the<00:02:41.609> very

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
just about he always chooses at the very

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:42.920 
just about he always chooses at the very
least<00:02:41.879> it's<00:02:42.090> a<00:02:42.180> cannon<00:02:42.480> rush<00:02:42.569> and<00:02:42.719> I<00:02:42.750> think

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
least it's a cannon rush and I think

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.899 
least it's a cannon rush and I think
he's<00:02:43.019> in<00:02:43.109> like<00:02:43.290> masters<00:02:43.889> or<00:02:44.099> grandmasters<00:02:44.790> or

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:44.909 
he's in like masters or grandmasters or

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:47.660 
he's in like masters or grandmasters or
something<00:02:45.209> like<00:02:45.299> that<00:02:45.500> something<00:02:46.500> silly<00:02:46.950> but

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
something like that something silly but

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.039 
something like that something silly but
yeah<00:02:47.790> so<00:02:48.000> he<00:02:48.120> just<00:02:48.269> can't<00:02:48.480> wash<00:02:48.599> and<00:02:48.780> he's<00:02:48.930> like

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
yeah so he just can't wash and he's like

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.500 
yeah so he just can't wash and he's like
perfected<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.650> cannon<00:02:49.980> rush<00:02:50.099> and<00:02:50.370> so<00:02:51.209> what<00:02:51.359> he

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
perfected the cannon rush and so what he

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.179 
perfected the cannon rush and so what he
would<00:02:51.689> do<00:02:51.780> on<00:02:51.930> Antigua<00:02:52.470> of<00:02:52.560> course<00:02:52.769> come<00:02:53.040> down

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:53.189 
would do on Antigua of course come down

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:54.949 
would do on Antigua of course come down
here<00:02:53.370> and<00:02:53.549> they<00:02:53.700> you<00:02:53.970> know<00:02:54.000> get<00:02:54.329> a<00:02:54.359> cannon<00:02:54.780> up<00:02:54.870> a

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.509 
here and they you know get a cannon up a
period<00:02:55.349> like<00:02:55.500> wall<00:02:55.739> himself<00:02:56.069> in<00:02:56.189> like<00:02:56.310> that

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
period like wall himself in like that

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.179 
period like wall himself in like that
get<00:02:56.760> a<00:02:56.790> cannon<00:02:57.239> then<00:02:57.840> he'd<00:02:57.959> go<00:02:58.200> up<00:02:58.530> top<00:02:58.919> and

00:02:59.179 --> 00:02:59.189

they dropped cannons up here and stuff

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.710 
they dropped cannons up here and stuff
so<00:03:00.810> by<00:03:01.049> building<00:03:01.680> this<00:03:01.769> wall<00:03:02.040> right<00:03:02.099> here<00:03:02.720> soon

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
so by building this wall right here soon

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.259 
so by building this wall right here soon
as<00:03:03.780> you<00:03:03.840> can<00:03:03.959> actually<00:03:04.079> stop<00:03:04.709> the<00:03:05.180> cannon<00:03:06.180> from

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
as you can actually stop the cannon from

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:07.819 
as you can actually stop the cannon from
going<00:03:06.540> up<00:03:06.629> so<00:03:07.019> it<00:03:07.079> looks<00:03:07.230> like<00:03:07.290> we're<00:03:07.500> possibly

of<00:03:32.970> immortal<00:03:33.720> all<00:03:34.019> in<00:03:34.669> with<00:03:35.669> these<00:03:35.849> units

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
of immortal all in with these units

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.750 
of immortal all in with these units
which<00:03:36.299> is<00:03:36.449> something<00:03:36.599> else<00:03:36.840> that<00:03:36.900> I've<00:03:37.079> seen

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
which is something else that I've seen

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.890 
which is something else that I've seen
but<00:03:38.760> i<00:03:38.790> believe<00:03:38.879> it<00:03:39.120> was<00:03:39.209> against<00:03:39.479> a<00:03:39.569> Terran

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
but i believe it was against a Terran

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:40.819 
but i believe it was against a Terran
player<00:03:39.989> that<00:03:40.199> I<00:03:40.260> saw<00:03:40.379> that<00:03:40.500> but<00:03:40.650> it<00:03:40.709> was<00:03:40.799> a

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
player that I saw that but it was a

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:43.009 
player that I saw that but it was a
proxied<00:03:41.280> robotics<00:03:41.699> facility<00:03:41.819> they<00:03:42.510> made<00:03:42.720> two

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
proxied robotics facility they made two

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.390 
proxied robotics facility they made two
to<00:03:43.169> three<00:03:43.379> immortals<00:03:43.650> and<00:03:43.859> then<00:03:44.010> they<00:03:44.129> pushed

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
to three immortals and then they pushed

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.339 
to three immortals and then they pushed
out<00:03:44.579> with<00:03:44.729> this<00:03:44.849> like<00:03:45.090> four<00:03:45.540> gate<00:03:45.750> army<00:03:46.169> and

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349 
out with this like four gate army and

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:48.619 
out with this like four gate army and
there's<00:03:46.859> the<00:03:46.919> four<00:03:47.190> gates<00:03:47.430> yep<00:03:47.669> so<00:03:48.239> it's<00:03:48.479> going

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:48.629 
there's the four gates yep so it's going

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:50.990 
there's the four gates yep so it's going
to<00:03:48.690> be<00:03:48.810> a<00:03:48.840> for<00:03:49.650> gate<00:03:49.949> and<00:03:50.190> I<00:03:50.280> guess<00:03:50.609> they<00:03:50.940> were

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
to be a for gate and I guess they were

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.969 
to be a for gate and I guess they were
saying<00:03:51.359> warp<00:03:51.690> prism<00:03:52.079> in<00:03:52.229> the<00:03:52.349> chat<00:03:52.620> so<00:03:52.829> it's

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:52.979 
saying warp prism in the chat so it's

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:54.199 
saying warp prism in the chat so it's
possibly<00:03:53.310> another<00:03:53.519> player<00:03:53.819> a<00:03:53.849> little<00:03:54.120> bit

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
possibly another player a little bit

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.830 
possibly another player a little bit
better<00:03:54.540> so<00:03:55.440> it<00:03:55.530> could<00:03:55.680> be<00:03:55.709> the<00:03:55.889> warp<00:03:56.069> prism<00:03:56.310> and

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
better so it could be the warp prism and

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.330 
better so it could be the warp prism and
what<00:03:57.840> did<00:03:57.900> I<00:03:58.019> say<00:03:58.260> before<00:03:58.650> and<00:03:58.919> we<00:03:59.010> might<00:03:59.189> be

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
what did I say before and we might be

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.610 
what did I say before and we might be
seeing<00:03:59.549> the<00:03:59.699> same<00:03:59.909> thing<00:04:00.239> out<00:04:00.479> of<00:04:00.780> Susie<00:04:01.439> again

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 
seeing the same thing out of Susie again

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:02.990 
seeing the same thing out of Susie again
it<00:04:02.040> looks<00:04:02.099> like<00:04:02.400> we're<00:04:02.519> going<00:04:02.609> to<00:04:02.729> be<00:04:02.790> seeing

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
it looks like we're going to be seeing

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.069 
it looks like we're going to be seeing
three<00:04:03.840> gate<00:04:04.109> blink<00:04:04.829> stalkers<00:04:05.989> but<00:04:06.989> the

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
three gate blink stalkers but the

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:08.599 
three gate blink stalkers but the
problem<00:04:07.319> is<00:04:07.379> he's<00:04:07.500> going<00:04:07.650> to<00:04:07.739> be<00:04:07.799> half<00:04:08.280> to

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:08.609 
problem is he's going to be half to

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:10.819 
problem is he's going to be half to
dealing<00:04:09.299> he's<00:04:09.720> going<00:04:09.870> to<00:04:09.989> have<00:04:10.229> to<00:04:10.259> deal<00:04:10.650> with

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
dealing he's going to have to deal with

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:15.199 
dealing he's going to have to deal with
for<00:04:11.759> gate<00:04:12.060> Robo<00:04:12.989> with<00:04:13.799> the<00:04:13.979> warp<00:04:14.220> prism<00:04:14.579> so

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
for gate Robo with the warp prism so

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.569 
for gate Robo with the warp prism so
that<00:04:15.659> could<00:04:15.840> be<00:04:16.019> very<00:04:16.320> difficult<00:04:17.159> to<00:04:17.370> deal

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
that could be very difficult to deal

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.569 
that could be very difficult to deal
with<00:04:17.609> and<00:04:17.780> actually<00:04:19.039> another<00:04:20.039> gateway<00:04:20.370> in

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
with and actually another gateway in

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:21.830 
with and actually another gateway in
another<00:04:20.789> Robo<00:04:21.060> so<00:04:21.180> it's<00:04:21.299> going<00:04:21.389> to<00:04:21.479> be<00:04:21.539> for

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
another Robo so it's going to be for

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.469 
another Robo so it's going to be for
gate<00:04:22.019> Rover<00:04:22.200> versus<00:04:23.010> for<00:04:23.250> gate<00:04:23.460> Robo<00:04:23.820> one

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
gate Rover versus for gate Robo one

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.550 
gate Rover versus for gate Robo one
player<00:04:24.750> is<00:04:25.050> getting<00:04:25.320> the<00:04:25.409> robotics<00:04:25.889> facility

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
player is getting the robotics facility

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.770 
player is getting the robotics facility
for<00:04:27.430> the<00:04:27.580> warp<00:04:27.760> prism<00:04:28.060> the<00:04:28.090> other<00:04:28.389> players

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
for the warp prism the other players

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.120 
for the warp prism the other players
gain<00:04:29.050> the<00:04:29.139> robotics<00:04:29.470> facility<00:04:29.560> for<00:04:30.040> the

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
gain the robotics facility for the

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.390 
gain the robotics facility for the
observer<00:04:30.520> for<00:04:30.850> the<00:04:30.880> blink<00:04:31.120> stalkers<00:04:31.389> and

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
observer for the blink stalkers and

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.830 
observer for the blink stalkers and
either<00:04:33.400> way<00:04:33.700> there's<00:04:33.940> no<00:04:34.000> centuries<00:04:34.510> going<00:04:34.720> up

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
either way there's no centuries going up

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.629 
either way there's no centuries going up
there<00:04:34.990> we<00:04:35.110> go<00:04:35.200> actually<00:04:35.380> as<00:04:35.800> I<00:04:36.190> say<00:04:36.400> that<00:04:36.430> I

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:36.639 
there we go actually as I say that I

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:38.580 
there we go actually as I say that I
lied<00:04:36.970> there<00:04:37.389> is<00:04:37.630> a<00:04:37.840> century<00:04:38.200> coming<00:04:38.380> up

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
lied there is a century coming up

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.780 
lied there is a century coming up
because<00:04:38.980> I<00:04:39.130> do<00:04:39.250> believe<00:04:39.700> Susie<00:04:41.010> had<00:04:42.010> no<00:04:42.730> she

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
because I do believe Susie had no she

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.090 
because I do believe Susie had no she
Susie<00:04:43.540> doesn't<00:04:43.750> Scout<00:04:44.110> but<00:04:44.650> soon<00:04:44.860> as<00:04:44.919> you<00:04:44.980> got

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
Susie doesn't Scout but soon as you got

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.129 
Susie doesn't Scout but soon as you got
a<00:04:45.160> little<00:04:45.310> worried<00:04:45.639> I<00:04:45.700> suppose<00:04:46.030> so<00:04:46.450> Susie

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 
a little worried I suppose so Susie

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:48.570 
a little worried I suppose so Susie
wanted<00:04:47.410> to<00:04:47.470> have<00:04:47.590> one<00:04:47.919> to<00:04:48.040> be<00:04:48.130> able<00:04:48.220> to<00:04:48.370> deal

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
wanted to have one to be able to deal

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.310 
wanted to have one to be able to deal
with<00:04:48.760> the<00:04:48.910> ramp<00:04:49.150> right<00:04:49.300> here<00:04:49.330> and<00:04:49.660> is<00:04:49.840> there

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
with the ramp right here and is there

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.930 
with the ramp right here and is there
going<00:04:50.470> to<00:04:50.530> be<00:04:50.620> any<00:04:50.860> way<00:04:51.370> to<00:04:51.430> deal<00:04:51.639> with<00:04:51.760> it<00:04:51.880> or

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
going to be any way to deal with it or

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.220 
going to be any way to deal with it or
is<00:04:52.030> this<00:04:52.120> century<00:04:52.389> can<00:04:52.570> go<00:04:52.630> down<00:04:52.780> it<00:04:52.900> will<00:04:53.080> get

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
is this century can go down it will get

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:54.870 
is this century can go down it will get
the<00:04:53.290> force<00:04:53.470> field<00:04:53.650> in<00:04:53.740> time<00:04:53.919> so<00:04:54.310> as<00:04:54.520> the<00:04:54.730> warp

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
the force field in time so as the warp

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.850 
the force field in time so as the warp
prism<00:04:55.090> comes<00:04:55.330> in<00:04:55.540> with<00:04:55.960> these<00:04:56.200> zealots<00:04:56.500> right

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
prism comes in with these zealots right

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.379 
prism comes in with these zealots right
here<00:04:57.130> that's<00:04:57.490> going<00:04:57.669> to<00:04:57.730> be<00:04:57.820> dropping<00:04:58.150> off<00:04:58.240> the

00:04:58.379 --> 00:04:58.389 
here that's going to be dropping off the

00:04:58.389 --> 00:04:59.760 
here that's going to be dropping off the
blink<00:04:58.630> stalkers<00:04:58.750> will<00:04:59.169> be<00:04:59.320> able<00:04:59.470> to<00:04:59.530> get<00:04:59.650> over

00:04:59.760 --> 00:04:59.770 
blink stalkers will be able to get over

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.050 
blink stalkers will be able to get over
there<00:05:00.010> in<00:05:00.100> time<00:05:00.220> to<00:05:00.400> kind<00:05:00.639> of<00:05:00.729> deal<00:05:00.880> with<00:05:00.940> this

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
there in time to kind of deal with this

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.879 
there in time to kind of deal with this
another<00:05:01.419> century's<00:05:01.810> out<00:05:01.930> gets<00:05:02.350> another<00:05:02.620> force

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:02.889 
another century's out gets another force

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:04.740 
another century's out gets another force
shield<00:05:03.100> down<00:05:03.220> so<00:05:03.370> this<00:05:03.460> is<00:05:03.520> done<00:05:03.790> very<00:05:04.210> well<00:05:04.300> by

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
shield down so this is done very well by

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.840 
shield down so this is done very well by
a<00:05:05.110> Suzy<00:05:05.800> from<00:05:05.979> holding<00:05:06.250> that<00:05:06.310> pursues<00:05:06.610> needs

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
a Suzy from holding that pursues needs

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.280 
a Suzy from holding that pursues needs
to<00:05:06.910> be<00:05:06.970> careful<00:05:07.300> not<00:05:07.330> to<00:05:07.600> walk<00:05:07.810> all<00:05:07.990> the

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:08.290 
to be careful not to walk all the

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:11.070 
to be careful not to walk all the
stalkers<00:05:08.770> over<00:05:09.610> into<00:05:10.060> nothing<00:05:10.570> able<00:05:10.840> to<00:05:10.900> pick

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
stalkers over into nothing able to pick

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.379 
stalkers over into nothing able to pick
off<00:05:11.200> the<00:05:11.470> warp<00:05:11.950> prism<00:05:12.310> at<00:05:12.370> the<00:05:12.460> very<00:05:12.610> least<00:05:12.850> but

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:13.389 
off the warp prism at the very least but

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:15.390 
off the warp prism at the very least but
she<00:05:13.570> trapped<00:05:14.080> herself<00:05:14.350> or<00:05:14.800> he<00:05:15.040> trapped

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
she trapped herself or he trapped

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.420 
she trapped herself or he trapped
himself<00:05:15.639> in<00:05:16.090> a<00:05:16.570> tiny<00:05:17.320> little<00:05:17.710> gap<00:05:18.130> right<00:05:18.370> there

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
himself in a tiny little gap right there

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.190 
himself in a tiny little gap right there
and<00:05:18.820> this<00:05:19.150> is<00:05:19.270> not<00:05:19.389> looking<00:05:19.540> good<00:05:19.690> for<00:05:19.840> Susie

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:20.200 
and this is not looking good for Susie

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.570 
and this is not looking good for Susie
at<00:05:20.290> all<00:05:20.380> now<00:05:20.530> is<00:05:20.710> neither<00:05:20.889> just<00:05:21.100> moves<00:05:21.340> right

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 
so Susie losing a lot of units trying to

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.730 
so Susie losing a lot of units trying to
go<00:05:52.330> for<00:05:52.419> that<00:05:52.570> warp<00:05:52.780> prism<00:05:53.080> put<00:05:53.320> her<00:05:53.410> put
