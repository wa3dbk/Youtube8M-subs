00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
so the first thing I noticed was when I

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.840 
so the first thing I noticed was when I
took<00:01:57.420> this<00:01:57.980> apart<00:01:58.980> there's<00:01:59.310> supposed<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.760> be

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
took this apart there's supposed to be

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.140 
took this apart there's supposed to be
two<00:02:00.150> speakers<00:02:00.660> here<00:02:01.160> that<00:02:02.160> connect<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:02.940> you

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
two speakers here that connect and you

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.930 
two speakers here that connect and you
can<00:02:03.300> turn<00:02:03.510> direct<00:02:04.290> your<00:02:04.530> sound<00:02:04.980> I've

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
can turn direct your sound I've

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.290 
can turn direct your sound I've
separated<00:02:06.510> these<00:02:07.050> first<00:02:07.470> and<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:08.550> noticed<00:02:09.030> that

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
separated these first and I noticed that

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.870 
separated these first and I noticed that
both<00:02:09.330> of<00:02:09.630> these<00:02:09.990> speakers<00:02:10.619> are<00:02:10.920> actually

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
both of these speakers are actually

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.090 
both of these speakers are actually
spliced<00:02:12.450> together<00:02:12.870> so<00:02:13.440> they<00:02:13.560> don't<00:02:13.770> even<00:02:13.860> have

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
spliced together so they don't even have

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.470 
spliced together so they don't even have
their<00:02:14.400> own<00:02:14.430> wires<00:02:15.000> to<00:02:15.390> each<00:02:15.570> speaker<00:02:16.490> and<00:02:17.490> on

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
their own wires to each speaker and on

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.640 
their own wires to each speaker and on
the<00:02:18.690> back<00:02:18.930> of<00:02:18.960> these<00:02:20.150> 15-watt<00:02:21.150> in<00:02:22.050> the

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
the back of these 15-watt in the

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.610 
the back of these 15-watt in the

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
research it said that they use speakers

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.390 
research it said that they use speakers
that<00:02:26.010> were<00:02:26.280> not<00:02:26.700> supposed<00:02:27.180> to<00:02:27.600> be<00:02:27.690> for<00:02:28.410> the

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
that were not supposed to be for the

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
sounds they were trying to get out of

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.990 
sounds they were trying to get out of
them<00:02:31.140> they're<00:02:31.590> not<00:02:31.770> set<00:02:32.130> up<00:02:32.160> for<00:02:32.310> tweeters

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
them they're not set up for tweeters

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.090 
them they're not set up for tweeters
they're<00:02:33.570> not<00:02:33.750> set<00:02:34.080> up<00:02:34.110> for<00:02:34.230> bass<00:02:34.590> they<00:02:34.890> just

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
they're not set up for bass they just

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.920 
they're not set up for bass they just
use<00:02:35.280> regular<00:02:35.550> speakers<00:02:36.210> and<00:02:36.480> this<00:02:36.570> is<00:02:36.780> the

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
use regular speakers and this is the

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.350 
use regular speakers and this is the
exact<00:02:37.290> same<00:02:37.620> speaker<00:02:38.010> that<00:02:38.790> you'll<00:02:38.940> find<00:02:39.180> in

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
exact same speaker that you'll find in

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.590 
exact same speaker that you'll find in
your<00:02:39.480> alarm<00:02:39.780> clock<00:02:40.700> now<00:02:41.700> if<00:02:42.030> it<00:02:42.210> got<00:02:42.390> even

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
your alarm clock now if it got even

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.620 
your alarm clock now if it got even
worse<00:02:43.190> because<00:02:44.190> after<00:02:44.580> I<00:02:44.610> took<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.210> speaker

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
worse because after I took the speaker

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.420 
worse because after I took the speaker
out<00:02:45.780> I<00:02:45.810> noticed<00:02:46.200> it<00:02:46.500> was<00:02:46.620> still<00:02:46.860> heavy<00:02:47.130> and

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
out I noticed it was still heavy and

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.070 
out I noticed it was still heavy and
there<00:02:47.610> was<00:02:47.730> no<00:02:47.940> weight<00:02:48.180> in<00:02:48.210> the<00:02:48.540> speaker<00:02:48.900> and<00:02:48.990> I

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
there was no weight in the speaker and I

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.500 
there was no weight in the speaker and I
saw<00:02:49.290> this<00:02:49.500> shit<00:02:49.860> I<00:02:50.190> don't<00:02:50.940> know<00:02:51.000> what<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.270> hell

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
saw this shit I don't know what the hell

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.310 
saw this shit I don't know what the hell
that<00:02:51.540> is

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
that is

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.960 
that is
I've<00:02:52.620> never<00:02:52.950> seen<00:02:53.280> anything<00:02:53.610> like<00:02:53.790> that

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
I've never seen anything like that

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.950 
I've never seen anything like that
before<00:02:54.890> what<00:02:55.890> it<00:02:56.010> turns<00:02:56.250> out<00:02:56.490> to<00:02:56.670> be<00:02:56.700> is<00:02:57.120> a

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:57.960 
before what it turns out to be is a

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.949 
before what it turns out to be is a
rubber<00:02:58.470> weight<00:02:59.030> that<00:03:00.030> they<00:03:00.180> put<00:03:00.420> in<00:03:00.570> it<00:03:00.690> so<00:03:00.900> it

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
rubber weight that they put in it so it

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.120 
rubber weight that they put in it so it
feel<00:03:01.290> heavy<00:03:01.500> and<00:03:01.860> seem<00:03:02.220> more<00:03:02.430> valuable<00:03:04.130> I've

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
feel heavy and seem more valuable I've

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:06.290 
feel heavy and seem more valuable I've
never<00:03:05.490> seen<00:03:05.760> that<00:03:05.910> before

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
never seen that before

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.810 
never seen that before
and<00:03:06.510> that's<00:03:07.470> very<00:03:07.830> obviously<00:03:08.310> them<00:03:08.580> just

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
and that's very obviously them just

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.850 
and that's very obviously them just
saying<00:03:09.060> we<00:03:09.240> know<00:03:09.390> it's<00:03:09.540> a<00:03:09.630> ripoff<00:03:09.989> we're<00:03:10.620> just
