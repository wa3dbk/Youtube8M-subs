00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.220
 yes love female colleagues colleagues warmly 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.570
 Welcome to the press conference 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.119
 our second championship match in 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.579
 this season after the home game against 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.650
 the vfl bochum goes these centers is 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:30.140
 then abroad to the point we are at 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:33.140
 fortuna düsseldorf or tomorrow 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.790
 seen that the fortuna current 17,500 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.100
 So we sold 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.000
 assume that the scenery is summer 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.590
 direction will go 30,000 more so 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.039
 a beautiful backdrop for our first 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.910
 away game 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:48.800
 we come to the researchers from the 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.470
 athletic view he is ours 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:54.370
 chess coach please markus small preview 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:57.230
 on the game yes hello together 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.570
 yes it's just like her matthias 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.880
 said 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.770
 for the first away game I am happy 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.579
 that we are a very attractive opponent 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.969
 to meet 

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:10.880
 the staff well staffed 

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:13.310
 is when I think about it only people 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.600
 like hp or jackets in this team 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.439
 they have a lot of experience 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.450
 feature 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:20.240
 then I believe that we are on one 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.280
 really good opponents meet his 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:25.880
 has ambitions and yes already 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.929
 outwardly clearly showed that 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.929
 Definitely around the 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:32.240
 also want to join in the climb 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:35.090
 and of course that's the attraction for us 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.719
 on sunday against such a team too 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.329
 consist 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:40.320
 We believe that we are good 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:44.430
 prepared for this game 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:47.100
 to the staff one can say that except 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.870
 lucky and thommy bertels still 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.090
 a bit of residue has hopefully 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:55.100
 All on board will be in question marks 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.060
 is still behind the silo man god 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:02.310
 a hardening in the back thigh 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:04.400
 has been injected and yesterday 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.990
 therefore was not allowed to train today 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.850
 I hope he will be here tomorrow 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.740
 final training again full 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.959
 is operational so we too 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.580
 can use it but there as well 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.720
 there is still a question mark 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.739
 We'll have to wait for that tomorrow 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:24.510
 otherwise we all have man on board 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:27.390
 the team is highly motivated yes that 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.850
 result of the bochum game im 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.070
 to correct something and play 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.230
 hopefully not only with 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:37.410
 successful or good football but 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.490
 also successful football points again 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.740
 to take back to Paderborn 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:46.070
 I think it's going to be exciting, like we're at 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:48.350
 choose our tactical alignment 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.460
 against a very offensively adjusted 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.010
 adversary you have it in the first game 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.690
 already seen away from union berlin 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.340
 that it is a team that is brave 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:03:00.890
 Looking forward plays her chances and 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:03.230
 there we will hopefully then 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:09.220
 Choose correct steps and measures 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:11.740
 to be successful against it 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.600
 So first it would be wrong to say 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.800
 to return because basically that 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.430
 I have always in the preparation 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:21.770
 let's say we prefer this 433 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.050
 we have a lot of time and that too 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:28.910
 Intensity used in preparation 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:30.130
 to automate the processes 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.260
 rehearse 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.910
 So that's the system that I am 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.840
 me stretch of the season 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.790
 imagine 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.130
 but we also said that we 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:44.060
 situational to a 4-4-2 can dodge 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:45.020
 and yes we have the last one 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.260
 final decision not yet taken 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.940
 but it is conceivable both because the opponent 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.210
 of course because he works for two 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:55.400
 that plays or probably a lot for two 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:59.510
 we just play now times as these 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.740
 option at least offers no the 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.770
 decision has not fallen that yet 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:06.920
 Of course, it is also systemically clear 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.420
 is when a player in the 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.250
 past such a good performance 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.780
 he has bid that, of course, too 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.160
 mentally strengthened in such a game goes 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.050
 So that's certainly a consideration 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.299
 value 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.320
 to let her start times since 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:20.270
 But the decision is not yet 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.860
 fallen because they just end of the 

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:29.270
 system depends no we have arranged 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:31.130
 that we are the players until today 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.760
 including in rehearsal training us 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.410
 look at 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.060
 We will connect with you now 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.860
 put together with the 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:41.479
 responsible consultant 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:44.860
 to clarify this as it goes on 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:44.860
 there are still questions about the sporting part 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:48.590
 if that is not the case then come on 

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:50.090
 sometimes too few around the game 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.099
 especially of course that too 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.060
 audience interest from our side 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:04:59.689
