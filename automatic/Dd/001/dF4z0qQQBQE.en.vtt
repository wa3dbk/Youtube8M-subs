00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:27.050
 of the latest technology looking for older 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.000
 yields greater efficiencies for 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.370
 that the farmers have greater 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.649
 productive of these lower costs already 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:36.680
 this fair we have brought a sample 

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:40.570
 commercial of the equipment that most apply 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:43.699
 that allow farmers to have 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:47.000
 great big productions 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:49.280
 performance over time then 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.940
 welcome we are waiting for you here

 and give them full advice in their 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.809
 agricultural productions 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.510
 good night my name is walter 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.180
 sanchez commercial machinery consultant 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.860
 agricultural john deer in this opportunity 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.880
 we are participating in the fair 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:14.570
 national livestock we brought in 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.400
 show a varied team of 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.070
 machinery 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:22.190
 concerning the mechanization issue what 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.850
 concerns the agricultural and livestock part 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.930
 in this opportunity we have a mower 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.490
 conditioner 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.439
 john deer 625 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.060
 and gives us the property gives us the 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.729
 qualities of 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.210
 and to make a very good quality 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.850
 since it has some rollers or some 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.039
 pallets that after cutting the 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.039
 material fracture in the stem for 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.470
 accelerate the process of dehydration 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:51.240
 with this we achieve 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:53.369
 unify faster and make a 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.640
 very good quality on the subject of 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.530
 building we are participating with a 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.030
 blinding conditioner to which 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:05.290
 requires a 125 horsepower tractor 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:09.009
 we also have rakes and elevators 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:11.110
 we have the theme of tractors for 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.660
 tractor farming , let's say that from 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.310
 low power the smallest we are 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.460
 bringing in the moment is a segment 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:21.790
 different from that of the mower a segment 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:24.850
 like the tractor 50 45 that is a tractor 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.500
 very versatile in the subject of livestock is 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.840
 the smallest compact tractor that 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.550
 we bring you I mean compact that you 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.730
 It does the same functions as a tractor 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:36.460
 large but on a smaller scale the 50 45 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.990
 especially that they are machines 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.490
 that have the support and 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:43.030
 guarantee where they will go through home 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:44.710
 all the incentive of finagro this friend 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.480
 farmer friend farmer can get 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:49.780
 an incentive subsidy that gives you finagro 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:53.440
 on the theme of gardening and golf 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:57.460
 we bring a reference mini tractor of 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:59.740
 130 which is a very versatile team in 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.510
 the gardening theme to prune 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.730
 meadows to make it maintenance has 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.740
 a very uniform cut has different 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.550
 chopped sizes and especially that with 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.010
 a very low cost 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:13.550
 we already have here a tractor here 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:16.370
 of reference 50 90 that is a tractor 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.680
 much more versatile I mean it is 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.960
 a tractor that can do jobs 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.990
 of livestock but in turn you can 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.180
 do planting preparation work 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:28.190
 of harvest when suddenly we have in 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.700
 the farm the possibility of planting corn 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.250
 or to make silo 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:37.629
 This machine is a 90 tractor 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:39.129
 horses is of Mexican origin and comes 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:41.590
 with a new design a structure 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:45.099
 metal fender motor tract 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:47.500
 of 90 horses already brings this in the part 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:49.239
 back is a device that is very compact 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.770
 and it has positioned itself very well in the 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.200
 market 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.570
 continuing already a bit with the part of 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.430
 handling of food material for the 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:59.140
 won 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:02.110
 we have the mincer is a john mincer 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:04.750
 deer of reference 972 gives us the 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.190
 possibility of feeding 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:10.300
 directly or whatever it is called 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:13.030
 I can cut green feed 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:15.850
 chop and I can feed directly 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.190
 feed in green gives us a property 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.049
 very good an advantage that I can 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.510
 work with three blades and it gives me a 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.310
 Cut size or I can install the 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.680
 another three blades to leave them in a 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.720
 total of six and it gives me a very size 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:32.380
 appropriate to ensilate when I need 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:34.000
 make silo in green feeding in 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.080
 green or nate or do century I can 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
 do with this same machine 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.550
 and here we have the part to 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:44.150
 complement what is gardening and golf 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:48.080
 we have the teams the gators that are 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:50.270
 utility equipment we have 22 teams 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:53.930
 at this moment in demonstration this is 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:56.300
 a rs x 850 and it is a very versatile equipment 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.520
 that gives me the function of having it as 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.590
 for landscaping develops me 90 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.490
 kilometers per hour and I can load 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.610
 also to overturned 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:09.590
 and this team is called a six by 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:13.220
 four is already a more rigid team 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:15.140
 gives me the ability to charge 400 500 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.990
 kilos a volt and pull a ton to 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:20.590
 shot then is a team that is a lot 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:22.670
 more oriented toward work towards 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:24.590
 tour the farm no longer have to 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:26.810
 tour the farm on horseback to get there 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.700
 tired but I just can already 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:31.670
 enjoy with a team that is very 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:34.130
 comfortable that is the sample that 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:35.840
 We brought from John Deer we have 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:38.450
 prices as it says at the beginning very 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:40.280
 competitive beyond the price is the 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:42.260
 I support the representation of Jean deer 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.780
 we have nationwide coverage 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:46.640
 We have nine dealerships each 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.350
 dealer has three or four 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.930
 distributors that is what we are 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:53.560
 speaking poorly counted from 35-40 points to 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.560
 Nacional level
