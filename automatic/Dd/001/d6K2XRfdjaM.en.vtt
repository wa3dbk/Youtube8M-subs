we<00:00:10.300> notice<00:00:10.599> when<00:00:10.870> we<00:00:10.900> start<00:00:11.200> here<00:00:11.349> we<00:00:11.469> are<00:00:11.500> in

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:11.650 
we notice when we start here we are in

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.370 
we notice when we start here we are in
the<00:00:11.770> key<00:00:11.920> of<00:00:11.950> C<00:00:12.190> major<00:00:12.630> okay<00:00:13.630> and<00:00:13.900> that<00:00:14.050> key<00:00:14.260> of

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:14.380 
the key of C major okay and that key of

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.320 
the key of C major okay and that key of
C<00:00:14.560> major<00:00:14.800> lasts<00:00:15.460> until<00:00:15.610> the<00:00:15.760> bottom<00:00:16.150> of<00:00:16.269> the

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:16.330 
C major lasts until the bottom of the

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.480 
C major lasts until the bottom of the
first<00:00:16.570> page<00:00:16.810> at<00:00:17.199> the<00:00:17.500> end<00:00:17.680> of<00:00:17.800> measure<00:00:17.949> 48

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.490 
first page at the end of measure 48

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.689 
first page at the end of measure 48
notice<00:00:18.910> opes<00:00:19.380> switches<00:00:20.380> two<00:00:20.679> sharps<00:00:21.099> back<00:00:21.460> up

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:21.699 
notice opes switches two sharps back up

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:24.390 
notice opes switches two sharps back up
to<00:00:21.880> the<00:00:21.999> key<00:00:22.179> of<00:00:22.300> D<00:00:22.539> major<00:00:22.890> okay<00:00:23.890> so<00:00:23.949> we<00:00:24.189> have<00:00:24.279> to

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:24.400 
to the key of D major okay so we have to

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.359 
to the key of D major okay so we have to
make<00:00:24.519> a<00:00:24.550> switch<00:00:24.880> there<00:00:25.319> also<00:00:26.319> we<00:00:26.980> notice<00:00:27.279> that

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:27.369 
make a switch there also we notice that

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:29.729 
make a switch there also we notice that
we<00:00:27.429> have<00:00:27.699> a<00:00:27.730> the<00:00:28.089> common<00:00:28.509> time<00:00:28.839> sign<00:00:29.409> with<00:00:29.710> a

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:29.739 
we have a the common time sign with a

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:31.470 
we have a the common time sign with a
line<00:00:30.099> through<00:00:30.369> it<00:00:30.489> which<00:00:30.730> means<00:00:30.880> we're<00:00:31.089> in<00:00:31.119> cut

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
line through it which means we're in cut

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.470 
line through it which means we're in cut
time<00:00:32.190> so<00:00:33.190> instead<00:00:33.489> of<00:00:33.550> counting<00:00:33.970> one<00:00:34.239> two

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
time so instead of counting one two

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:40.619 
time so instead of counting one two
three<00:00:35.440> four<00:00:36.010> we're<00:00:36.850> counting<00:00:37.210> 1<00:00:37.719> into<00:00:38.500> 1<00:00:39.629> into

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:40.629 
three four we're counting 1 into 1 into

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:43.529 
three four we're counting 1 into 1 into
1<00:00:40.840> into<00:00:41.820> so<00:00:42.820> this<00:00:42.969> is<00:00:43.059> all<00:00:43.120> it's<00:00:43.210> gonna<00:00:43.300> be<00:00:43.510> a

00:00:43.529 --> 00:00:43.539 
1 into so this is all it's gonna be a

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:47.490 
1 into so this is all it's gonna be a
faster<00:00:44.079> a<00:00:44.109> quicker<00:00:44.410> pace<00:00:45.269> okay<00:00:46.269> we<00:00:47.170> have<00:00:47.320> some

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
faster a quicker pace okay we have some

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.840 
faster a quicker pace okay we have some
boa<00:00:47.710> retakes<00:00:48.160> at<00:00:48.339> measure<00:00:48.519> 22<00:00:49.179> and<00:00:49.390> 26<00:00:50.219> okay<00:00:51.219> we

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
you're gonna switch to the key of D

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.800 
you're gonna switch to the key of D
major<00:01:13.890> now<00:01:14.940> I'm<00:01:15.940> sure<00:01:16.150> you're<00:01:16.360> looking<00:01:16.540> down

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
major now I'm sure you're looking down

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.140 
major now I'm sure you're looking down
there<00:01:16.990> 69<00:01:17.590> going<00:01:18.040> whew

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.150 
there 69 going whew

there 69 going whew
okay<00:01:19.690> now<00:01:20.230> this<00:01:20.830> is<00:01:21.040> a<00:01:21.070> metronome<00:01:21.610> session

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
okay now this is a metronome session

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.730 
okay now this is a metronome session
section<00:01:22.840> here<00:01:23.020> that<00:01:23.050> you<00:01:23.290> need<00:01:23.440> to<00:01:23.560> work

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
section here that you need to work

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.010 
section here that you need to work
slowly<00:01:24.130> with<00:01:24.430> a<00:01:24.460> metronome<00:01:24.790> okay<00:01:25.600> to<00:01:25.660> build

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
slowly with a metronome okay to build

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.440 
slowly with a metronome okay to build
your<00:01:26.380> speed<00:01:26.650> up<00:01:26.950> don't<00:01:27.790> just<00:01:28.000> try<00:01:28.150> to<00:01:28.180> just

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
your speed up don't just try to just

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.900 
your speed up don't just try to just
jump<00:01:28.900> in<00:01:29.080> there<00:01:29.350> okay<00:01:30.160> unless<00:01:30.280> your<00:01:30.520> technique

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
jump in there okay unless your technique

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.850 
jump in there okay unless your technique
will<00:01:31.090> allow<00:01:31.360> it<00:01:31.570> but<00:01:32.080> I<00:01:32.110> would<00:01:32.380> suggest<00:01:32.590> that

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
will allow it but I would suggest that

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.320 
will allow it but I would suggest that
you<00:01:32.950> take<00:01:33.220> that<00:01:33.370> slower<00:01:33.730> and<00:01:33.940> work<00:01:34.150> with<00:01:34.300> a

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
you take that slower and work with a

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.730 
you take that slower and work with a
metronome<00:01:34.690> like<00:01:34.990> we've<00:01:35.170> been<00:01:35.290> working<00:01:35.410> in

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
metronome like we've been working in

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.040 
metronome like we've been working in
class<00:01:36.040> okay<00:01:37.030> now<00:01:37.180> I'll<00:01:37.330> play<00:01:37.570> it<00:01:37.690> this<00:01:37.810> time

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:38.050 
class okay now I'll play it this time

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.420 
class okay now I'll play it this time
with<00:01:38.260> our<00:01:38.410> tempo<00:01:38.710> but<00:01:38.830> the<00:01:38.920> tempo<00:01:39.130> is<00:01:39.190> gonna<00:01:39.340> be

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
with our tempo but the tempo is gonna be

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:40.950 
with our tempo but the tempo is gonna be
a<00:01:39.460> little<00:01:39.610> under<00:01:40.030> tempo<00:01:40.240> just<00:01:40.420> to<00:01:40.630> help<00:01:40.810> get

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
a little under tempo just to help get

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.180 
a little under tempo just to help get
this<00:01:41.080> under<00:01:41.380> our<00:01:41.410> fingers<00:01:41.770> so<00:01:41.800> we're<00:01:42.070> learning

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190
