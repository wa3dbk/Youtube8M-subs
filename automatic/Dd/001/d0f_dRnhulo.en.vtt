00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.160
 tutorial I wanted to make you a make proposal 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.679
 up for the upcoming holidays then that 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.840
 you can use for Christmas or for 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.639
 New Year's Eve as you prefer to me 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.680
 personally really like it too much 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.100
 and so I hope so much that I also like a 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.539
 you 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.230
 and then nothing remains for me 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.699
 leave you to the tutorial and nothing I believe for 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.039
 make my base 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.590
 this time I will use this foundation 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.439
 compact of crippa is a point of life 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.750
 then in cream and therefore very much 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.239
 covering because for the holidays we want 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.579
 just a perfect skin from then 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.070
 all covered but who is it but what lines 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.960
 propose etc. and so this 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.760
 I look and do his duty very well 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.680
 I must say that I like very much therefore for 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.390
 some occasions like the holidays 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.090
 since I have here I have believed before 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.090
 I remind you that you can get a discount 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.820
 10 percent forever without a 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.550
 minimum order on crippa products for 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.920
 this just click on the link found 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.570
 in the information box under the video ve 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.479
 I said it because you're a nice idea 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.580
 especially in view of the holidays 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.990
 for gifts all this, however, apart 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.630
 this then we continue with the 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.909
 tutorial and I'm going to do my base 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.470
 then with the compact foundation e 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.580
 this point therefore becomes as I said 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:26.689
 first you like it a lot because it's a lot 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:26.689
 opaque so it's perfect for parties 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:36.030
 I must say that you don't feel at all 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.859
 heavy on the skin what could 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.530
 happen with a cream foundation 

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:42.630
 like this then I honestly feel it 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.380
 very comfortable so no give me 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.390
 annoyance here is always enough 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.340
 stunned when I use this foundation 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.149
 because I don't know if you can notice but 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.619
 it really covers everything so I have to say 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.649
 that I really like and accuse him 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.049
 especially on occasions like 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:04.319
 the concealer especially for the area 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:06.869
 of the dark circles I will use this here of the 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:09.420
 brand lms beauty which is called a 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.190
 cobra i number 11 this say the 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.049
 true a 3 in 1 product because you are 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.629
 collectors that foundation that cream 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:16.500
 moisturizing and is an excellent product to me 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.690
 really like it 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.160
 I personally the constancy on the site 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.470
 so there is also a video then 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.540
 in case I put the inter part on 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.040
 with the annotation in the video if you want 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.260
 see what bought on this site 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.420
 because of the really cool things 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.090
 however I am going to deprive the product with a 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.859
 cat tongue brush then with 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.250
 the flat effect mainly the 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:40.200
 I do to illuminate this area because 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.269
 I don't like much of dark circles you like 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.829
 however have this area this 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:50.639
 harmless triangle a little more enlightened 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:54.299
 lighter than the rest of the face and therefore 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:56.130
 then the leaf through and then go to 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:59.010
 fix the foundation and concealer with the 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.569
 powder and also here I use this here b 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.980
 crippa because as I said in the 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.079
 video of used their products 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.900
 I really like it because it's a lot 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:08.730
 natural and has no effect at all 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.340
 dusty so it is very light like 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.200
 dust then simply field not 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.160
 can especially so in the area t with 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.260
 the big brush 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.790
 the base makes to put the blush and ho 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.370
 chose to put a cream blush 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.750
 because I prefer them maybe those in 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.820
 dust as they also give one 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.890
 slight brightness that I really like 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.440
 in the area of the cheekbones of the cheeks 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.960
 that's why I chose to wear this 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.930
 blush of the brand of the vice that is called 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:38.840
 noble and then I simply go to 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:38.840
 blending slightly on the cheeks 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:49.630
 as always we are going to spread the primer 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:51.910
 on the whole upper eyelid for the 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:56.940
 light point should be used enjoy eyeshadow 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:59.800
 manila that a bright champagne color 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:03.370
 for this trick I'll use mainly 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:05.620
 this palette in shades of silver and 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.810
 of black then to create your own 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.450
 sophisticated I go to take this 

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:13.300
 eye shadow in the center and this 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:16.660
 very nice bright gray this one here 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:21.340
 very particular and I'm going to roll it up 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:26.020
 all the mobile eyelid coming 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:28.270
 then up to the stone then I take 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.940
 the eyeshadow then them gray that this color 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:34.720
 very light silver almost white 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:38.170
 bright and I'm going to put it in the center 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:42.940
 of the upper eyelid in order to 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:44.710
 create a three-dimensional effect from 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.600
 this state I take an eye shadow 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.390
 dell'icaic beach that this eyeshadow in 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:52.660
 half and I'm going to put it on the fold 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:55.990
 of the eye so don't fade much 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:59.140
 lightly then take a black eye shadow 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:02.340
 out that a Europe escaped putting it 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:06.670
 in the outer part of the eye and therefore 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:09.340
 at the end of the crease and los smoke 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:12.880
 slightly to create a shadow 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:15.340
 los smoke a little even on the fold then 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:18.640
 a little up here and very important 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:21.940
 then blend the edges well so that 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:24.480
 then there are no clear breaks e 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:27.370
 if you notice then doing so 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.200
 there is this somewhat elongated effect no 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.610
 which at the end of the eye does not 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.190
 excessively because in any case not 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:35.020
 I wanted an exaggerated thing then they take 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:38.500
 gray eye shadow we put on 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:41.070
 on the upper eyelid and fade it 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.930
 and along the line of the lower lashes 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:46.510
 if you notice this time I put a little more than 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:49.060
 product below because i want to render 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:51.330
 the look even more captivating 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.819
 languid finish with eye shadows I take 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:56.460
 the light silver that we have faded to 

00:05:53.819 --> 00:06:00.060
 center of the upper eyelid and go to 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:02.789
 put it inside the eye in the 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:06.389
 inside here to create a point 

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:08.250
 light inside the eye I go to 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:10.500
 put that meat this morning 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:12.780
 of the media cosmetics called 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.159
 ivory then you see the contrast of the 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:17.280
 light pencil inside the eye 

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:19.639
 with a dark eye shadow under spa really 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.639
 very well 

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:27.180
 to complete the trick then later 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:29.669
 line heiner we can switch to mascara 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:31.590
 and I wanted to show that the line of 

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:33.240
 eyeliner in the end I made it upside down 

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:35.310
 then to highlight this effect 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:37.889
 that thai and nothing so this is the 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:40.349
 eye makeup finished now we can 

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:43.590
 then move on to the lips I wanted 

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:47.909
 propose two variants, the first is this 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:50.009
 with this peach-colored lipstick that 

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:51.800
 I think it's very well combined with 

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:54.990
 trick that I really like in the whole 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:57.900
 I find that there is harmony in the balance 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:59.550
 trick and for this first variant 

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.919
 I used this but real roof 

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:03.960
 aspect of the brand helps you 

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:06.090
 called dress you up which is a lot 

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.650
 writing very pigmented in fact me 

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:10.020
 love it a lot too 

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:12.029
 soft and comfortable on the lips e 

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:13.800
 then I repeat that the color in my opinion is 

00:07:12.029 --> 00:07:16.620
 perfect for other things with the 

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:19.199
 certainly more sexy variant and does a little 

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:22.080
 the more he gave no because we have lips 

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:24.270
 red and I used this lipstick 

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:27.139
 decree because I love it very much 

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:29.849
 because hyper pigmented it is very soft 

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:31.650
 sliding and is a color as you can 

00:07:29.849 --> 00:07:34.409
 note that you are therefore very sexy 

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:36.930
 and appealing this is called ruby red 

00:07:34.409 --> 00:07:38.520
 and molosso that in my opinion perfect 

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:40.650
 especially for the holidays so when 

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:43.950
 we can dare a little more even with the 

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:45.630
 lips and definitely this choice 

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:47.520
 the zoe obstacle brings makeup to a 

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:49.800
 another level as you can also see 

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:52.680
