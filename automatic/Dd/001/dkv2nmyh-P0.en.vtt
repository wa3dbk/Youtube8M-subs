00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.259
 of the car step by step is in this case 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.679
 video that I believe will serve the goal 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.030
 square the voyage santana to take the 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.179
 old volks cars do not have 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.279
 knowledge of whether these more 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.369
 new case offer replacement 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.820
 only spring today but the process is the 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:26.730
 even for a damper 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.910
 then there is our step by step removing 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.009
 the screws located in the trunk 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.640
 I'll do it is to remove the screws 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.410
 that just behind the trunk is 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.200
 identify the two screws in the 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.300
 two sides of the car and will remove when 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.190
 I thought I'd follow 1 and it worked out better 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.510
 it needs to be locked up with the key 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:51.300
 used a key 16 that will remove 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.930
 they are always observed in sequence that 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.660
 of these parts she is arrested rubber 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.930
 which was last removed here a 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.699
 video door open open remove this 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.040
 here with key 16 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.140
 if you can save this sequence of 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.290
 and said 'if you do not get in 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:14.250
 it is very important to support the car in the 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.570
 easel water in love support the pipe 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.869
 here for many years and goes 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.820
 get up there with concertina jack go 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.979
 put the car to fit it well it goes 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.850
 getting off the monkey will be supported 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.650
 easel 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.530
 on the other side is also to do the same 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:32.369
 Uzbek way a cacophony is very good 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.750
 to example the car in exchange more than 30 a 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.549
 40 centimeters 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.740
 so I want to do the other side 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.090
 same scheme you have two monkeys 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.520
 better yet it will make it much easier 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.340
 service here and this here is the part of 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.259
 where the axle was raised. 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.009
 the wheel stayed there on the ground fixed in the 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.259
 floor 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.240
 here is the vision of hell here a 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.820
 unhappy suggestion 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:02:00.220
 this is the axle that holds the wheels 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:02.440
 and as the fans do not leave now 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.450
 let's go to our next move is mobile 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.430
 and springs and shock absorbers 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.759
 now the next step is to remove the springs 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.280
 here we go under the base 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:15.130
 of the damper joins and xu and will use 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.310
 one key two keys and 17 keys to power 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:21.660
 remove these screw is very 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:26.160
 you a power w to facilitate the removal 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.160
 next to each other and do the same scheme 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.989
 the safety easel did not happen 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:37.420
 an accident that the monkey can not 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:43.390
 trust very level here key 16 17 and 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:48.459
 will remove these screws to power 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:50.680
 will take the spring and antaq bumper frames 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.620
 retired forget to keep joyful 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.709
 was chosen for the inside 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.450
 remove now always as a result of the 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.830
 species that has a buffer take 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:04.500
 Be very careful with that you can not 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:09.070
 and then carefully removing it here 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:14.549
 but now make the spring replacement and 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:18.040
 of our new ball damper 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:21.430
 eighty reais and placing shock absorbers 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:24.220
 and springs do not make me put that ball 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.440
 new and costs 82 is the car fall 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:30.040
 presidency at that point it in MOTELx 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:32.440
 course and we will facilitate at the 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.780
 time to put it back inside you create 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.880
 six goals a wire that tied that 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.769
 points out that the damper can be used 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.410
 put a screw on our planet 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:43.450
 is easier to see is led by 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.430
 inside that went from the trunk goes 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.880
 to facilitate much serves you 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:50.890
 then just pick up and screw on that 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.269
 sequence that had before the attack on 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.570
 motorcycle must be in this position. 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:57.640
 Do not forget that and it will be 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:01.330
 directed over those pulled 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:05.620
 team again here 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:08.110
 here is tighten our our 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.780
 that at the base of the axle 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:14.560
 we put the spring there in that sequence 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:19.630
 in her correct position and let's 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:21.640
 here the lower removed the easels 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:23.830
 get up with monkey remove on 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:25.780
 time is required and two 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.130
 facilitate but can also be used to 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.020
 give a little more work 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.300
 a path that goes down here now 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:34.150
 monkey the macs iphones what what 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:37.030
 I recommend doing your service. 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:40.600
 coming down it 's a person the person has 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:42.940
 network directing there screw points 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:47.170
 bumper on that skipped door 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:49.450
 but then I can do what's left then 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:52.990
 hence they can use this wire here 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:56.050
 I did it here so I could drive on 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:57.870
 Perfect place here the end this way 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:01.510
 I gave it a lot 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:07.950
 You have more help to understand the 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:11.200
 epithelium here was only to remove the screw 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:12.370
 take that door there, everything is alright 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.740
 so here I have an hour I 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:17.200
 I messed up here on the net low channel and got 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:21.880
 in the can and lowered and if this hinders 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:24.370
 shake with the bingo brand but not 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.140
 necessary since I knew that 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:30.240
 I did it here if you did not make the same mistake. 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:33.910
 because there was a spider staying with a 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:36.580
 painted on the door a screw that gives 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:38.980
 account of the damper and will place here 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:39.940
 again in the same sequence was 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:43.980
 before 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.980
 he points out that if the ball direitinha 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:53.500
 Putting it right will change to 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:57.009
 me later you see who is needed 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:58.720
 I thought I could fix this one and found 

00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:02.400
 to be able to hold the head here for the
