00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:15.630 
I've sort of turned it around over the

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.570 
I've sort of turned it around over the
last<00:00:15.809> 17<00:00:16.619> years<00:00:16.650> because<00:00:17.310> this<00:00:17.460> is<00:00:17.550> a

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
last 17 years because this is a

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.029 
last 17 years because this is a
corporate<00:00:18.060> market<00:00:18.480> here<00:00:18.750> you've<00:00:19.350> got<00:00:19.650> the

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
corporate market here you've got the

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.439 
corporate market here you've got the
average<00:00:20.340> person<00:00:20.789> that<00:00:20.880> will<00:00:21.029> have<00:00:21.150> probably

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
average person that will have probably

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.259 
average person that will have probably
three<00:00:21.720> classes<00:00:22.289> per<00:00:22.769> shift<00:00:23.039> so<00:00:23.640> if<00:00:24.090> you

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
three classes per shift so if you

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.390 
three classes per shift so if you
include<00:00:24.420> say<00:00:24.779> beer<00:00:25.019> glass<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.320> wine<00:00:25.710> glass<00:00:25.949> and

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
include say beer glass a wine glass and

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.040 
include say beer glass a wine glass and
that<00:00:26.910> might<00:00:27.090> have<00:00:27.210> up<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.630> two<00:00:27.779> classes

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
that might have up to two classes

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.779 
that might have up to two classes
depending<00:00:28.320> if<00:00:28.710> they<00:00:28.740> have<00:00:28.949> white<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.340> red<00:00:29.519> and

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
depending if they have white and red and

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.370 
depending if they have white and red and
of<00:00:30.210> course<00:00:30.449> I'm<00:00:30.539> in<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.720> water<00:00:30.869> glass<00:00:31.109> which<00:00:31.349> is

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
of course I'm in a water glass which is

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.979 
of course I'm in a water glass which is
big<00:00:31.710> business<00:00:31.859> these<00:00:32.219> days<00:00:32.279> so<00:00:33.239> if<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.690> I

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
big business these days so if you I

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.010 
big business these days so if you I
guess

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
guess

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.690 
guess
multiply<00:00:37.020> three<00:00:37.410> glasses<00:00:37.680> per<00:00:38.160> person<00:00:38.610> if

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
multiply three glasses per person if

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.830 
multiply three glasses per person if
you're<00:00:38.820> doing<00:00:38.910> an<00:00:39.030> average<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.329> say<00:00:39.450> sixty

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
you're doing an average to say sixty

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.740 
you're doing an average to say sixty
people<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.140> day<00:00:40.350> hundred<00:00:41.190> glasses<00:00:41.700> per<00:00:42.210> shift

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
people a day hundred glasses per shift

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:43.940 
people a day hundred glasses per shift

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
obviously if you have ladies with

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.310 
obviously if you have ladies with
lipstick<00:00:44.340> for<00:00:44.520> example<00:00:45.230> you're<00:00:46.230> always

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
lipstick for example you're always

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.510 
lipstick for example you're always
thinking<00:00:46.770> you've<00:00:46.860> got<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:47.070> plunge<00:00:47.309> the

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
thinking you've got to plunge the

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.760 
thinking you've got to plunge the

then make sure that you're drawing the

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.930 
then make sure that you're drawing the

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
edges to you know remove any residue of

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.150 
edges to you know remove any residue of
anything<00:00:54.449> especially<00:00:55.320> with<00:00:55.710> fatty

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
shocked me is the fact that we have

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.940 
shocked me is the fact that we have
using<00:01:14.610> any<00:01:14.939> detergent<00:01:15.770> basically<00:01:16.770> what

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
using any detergent basically what

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.370 
using any detergent basically what
happens<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.400> that<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.970> load<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.140> glasses

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380

into<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.189> machine<00:01:20.960> close<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.140> door<00:01:22.380> press

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
into the machine close the door press

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.070 
into the machine close the door press
the<00:01:22.890> button<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.490> they're<00:01:24.299> basically<00:01:24.750> done

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
the button and they're basically done

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.590 
the button and they're basically done
within<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.920> minute<00:01:26.340> which<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:26.850> just<00:01:27.060> amazing

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
within a minute which is just amazing

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.730 
within a minute which is just amazing
because<00:01:27.689> normally<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.110> would<00:01:28.200> take<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.409> lot<00:01:28.710> a

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
because normally it would take a lot a

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.039 
because normally it would take a lot a
long<00:01:28.979> time<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:30.030> do<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.150> normal<00:01:30.329> cycle<00:01:30.720> and

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
long time to do a normal cycle and

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.620 
long time to do a normal cycle and
basically<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.579> can<00:01:32.610> be<00:01:32.820> anywhere<00:01:33.240> in<00:01:33.479> your
