down on it before that if you're going

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.559 
down on it before that if you're going
to<00:00:05.279> pedal<00:00:05.640> around<00:00:05.730> the<00:00:06.029> circle<00:00:06.450> you're

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
to pedal around the circle you're

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.379 
to pedal around the circle you're
actually<00:00:06.720> pushing<00:00:07.259> forward<00:00:07.910> but<00:00:08.910> if<00:00:09.030> we<00:00:09.059> try

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
actually pushing forward but if we try

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.049 
actually pushing forward but if we try
and<00:00:09.540> push<00:00:09.809> too<00:00:10.110> hard<00:00:10.139> forward<00:00:11.070> too<00:00:11.400> soon<00:00:11.730> on

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
and push too hard forward too soon on

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.060 
and push too hard forward too soon on
this<00:00:12.570> it<00:00:12.780> wants<00:00:13.019> to<00:00:13.139> roll<00:00:14.089> under<00:00:15.089> your<00:00:15.389> foot

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070 
this it wants to roll under your foot

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.920 
this it wants to roll under your foot
and<00:00:17.070> come<00:00:17.430> to<00:00:17.580> find<00:00:17.609> out<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.240> thicker<00:00:18.480> a<00:00:18.600> pedal

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
and come to find out the thicker a pedal

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.099 
and come to find out the thicker a pedal
is<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.320> more<00:00:19.740> it<00:00:19.800> wants<00:00:20.070> to<00:00:20.189> roll<00:00:20.369> so<00:00:21.050> if<00:00:22.050> we

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
is the more it wants to roll so if we

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:29.419 
is the more it wants to roll so if we
take<00:00:22.230> a<00:00:22.410> couple<00:00:22.680> of<00:00:22.830> extra<00:00:23.189> pedals<00:00:23.519> here<00:00:28.429> my

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
yeah you just slop great over top of it

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.500 
yeah you just slop great over top of it
roast<00:01:02.910> every<00:01:03.450> time<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:03.810> like<00:01:04.230> that<00:01:04.470> there<00:01:04.890> we<00:01:05.010> go

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:25.160 

okay<00:01:09.510> now<00:01:11.600> that's<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.750> triple<00:01:13.170> thick<00:01:13.320> cover

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.210 

small<00:01:25.890> amount<00:01:26.189> of<00:01:26.310> duct<00:01:26.520> tape<00:01:26.750> magic<00:01:27.950> we<00:01:28.950> take

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
small amount of duct tape magic we take

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.200 
small amount of duct tape magic we take
these<00:01:29.400> same<00:01:29.700> three<00:01:29.970> petals<00:01:31.070> and<00:01:32.070> now<00:01:32.820> simulate

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
these same three petals and now simulate

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.740 
these same three petals and now simulate
what<00:01:33.990> we<00:01:34.140> would<00:01:34.290> have<00:01:35.000> if<00:01:36.000> your<00:01:36.240> pedal<00:01:36.570> was

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
what we would have if your pedal was

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.350 
what we would have if your pedal was
five<00:01:37.290> times<00:01:38.720> as<00:01:39.720> thick<00:01:40.170> as<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.409> ordinarily<00:01:40.740> is

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
five times as thick as it ordinarily is

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.149 
five times as thick as it ordinarily is
once<00:01:42.360> again<00:01:42.450> my<00:01:42.810> assistant<00:01:43.320> will<00:01:43.440> risk<00:01:43.710> life

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
once again my assistant will risk life

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:52.770 
once again my assistant will risk life
and<00:01:44.310> limb<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:45.200> demonstrate<00:01:46.200> this<00:01:46.440> get<00:01:49.580> high

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:02:01.750 

and<00:01:53.780> you<00:01:53.990> even<00:01:54.020> stand<00:01:54.560> by<00:01:54.950> o<00:02:00.280> blessed<00:02:01.280> is<00:02:01.610> to

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
and you even stand by o blessed is to

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.490 
and you even stand by o blessed is to
hire<00:02:01.970> you're<00:02:02.270> off<00:02:02.390> the<00:02:02.570> pedals<00:02:02.960> less<00:02:03.200> ability

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
hire you're off the pedals less ability

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:09.340 
hire you're off the pedals less ability
up<00:02:03.890> yes

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.290 

liquor<00:02:10.350> this<00:02:10.619> pedal<00:02:11.010> is<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.430> less<00:02:11.670> stable<00:02:12.000> it

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
liquor this pedal is the less stable it

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.710 
liquor this pedal is the less stable it
is<00:02:12.980> therefore<00:02:13.980> if<00:02:14.340> a<00:02:14.430> thicker<00:02:14.670> paddle<00:02:15.120> is<00:02:15.360> less

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
is therefore if a thicker paddle is less

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.520 
is therefore if a thicker paddle is less
stable<00:02:16.170> than<00:02:16.640> the<00:02:17.640> dinner<00:02:17.940> one<00:02:18.180> must

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
stable than the dinner one must

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:26.750 
stable than the dinner one must
reinstate<00:02:21.890> that<00:02:25.070> was<00:02:26.070> the<00:02:26.160> main<00:02:26.340> reason<00:02:26.370> for

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
reinstate that was the main reason for

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.440 
reinstate that was the main reason for
making<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.300> fly<00:02:27.480> paper<00:02:27.690> covers<00:02:28.140> daddy<00:02:28.680> no

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
making the fly paper covers daddy no

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.110 
making the fly paper covers daddy no
magic<00:02:31.430> we<00:02:32.430> were<00:02:32.490> trying<00:02:32.580> to<00:02:32.700> think<00:02:32.790> what

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
magic we were trying to think what

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.610 
magic we were trying to think what
you're<00:02:33.240> going<00:02:33.390> to<00:02:33.450> call<00:02:33.630> them<00:02:33.780> my<00:02:33.870> god<00:02:34.080> you

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
you're going to call them my god you

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.220 
you're going to call them my god you
know<00:02:34.710> maybe<00:02:34.950> you<00:02:35.220> would<00:02:35.400> already<00:02:36.300> was<00:02:36.840> it<00:02:37.020> that

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
know maybe you would already was it that

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.680 
know maybe you would already was it that
the<00:02:37.590> good<00:02:38.310> people<00:02:38.340> calls<00:02:38.850> out<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.150> brand<00:02:39.450> of

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
the good people calls out the brand of

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.780 
the good people calls out the brand of
components<00:02:40.290> they<00:02:40.950> don't<00:02:41.130> homegrown<00:02:41.610> and

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
components they don't homegrown and

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.190 
components they don't homegrown and
those<00:02:41.910> could<00:02:42.060> be<00:02:42.120> except<00:02:42.390> flatty<00:02:45.080> it<00:02:46.080> was

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
those could be except flatty it was

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.630 
those could be except flatty it was
funny<00:02:46.350> the<00:02:46.530> time<00:02:48.980> just<00:02:49.980> back<00:02:50.160> it<00:02:50.340> into<00:02:50.550> the

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
funny the time just back it into the

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:57.850 
funny the time just back it into the
fence<00:02:50.820> over<00:02:51.150> there

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.059 

so<00:02:58.860> your<00:02:59.040> average<00:02:59.459> platform<00:03:00.060> pedal<00:03:00.450> is<00:03:00.630> about

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
so your average platform pedal is about

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:05.660 
so your average platform pedal is about
24<00:03:02.069> or<00:03:02.340> 25<00:03:02.880> millimeters<00:03:03.600> thick<00:03:04.250> there's<00:03:05.250> some

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
24 or 25 millimeters thick there's some

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.449 
24 or 25 millimeters thick there's some
down<00:03:06.150> into<00:03:06.450> the<00:03:06.569> 21<00:03:07.110> millimeter<00:03:07.410> range<00:03:08.010> and

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
down into the 21 millimeter range and

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.290 
down into the 21 millimeter range and
then<00:03:09.420> there's<00:03:09.600> a<00:03:09.660> few<00:03:10.080> that<00:03:10.590> they<00:03:10.800> call

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
then there's a few that they call

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.790 
then there's a few that they call
low-profile<00:03:12.300> pedals<00:03:12.810> so<00:03:13.020> that<00:03:13.140> are<00:03:13.260> 17

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
low-profile pedals so that are 17

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.270 
low-profile pedals so that are 17
millimeters<00:03:14.430> thick<00:03:15.590> well<00:03:16.590> the<00:03:16.650> fly<00:03:16.860> papers

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
millimeters thick well the fly papers

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:24.170 
millimeters thick well the fly papers
are<00:03:17.489> 3.7<00:03:19.430> so<00:03:20.870> your<00:03:21.870> so<00:03:22.170> called<00:03:22.470> low<00:03:22.770> profile<00:03:23.370> 17

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
are 3.7 so your so called low profile 17

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.180 
are 3.7 so your so called low profile 17
millimeter<00:03:24.690> pedals<00:03:25.170> are<00:03:25.380> almost<00:03:25.709> five<00:03:26.160> times

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
millimeter pedals are almost five times

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:32.440 
millimeter pedals are almost five times
as<00:03:26.970> thick<00:03:27.239> as<00:03:28.010> this<00:03:29.300> so<00:03:30.300> we<00:03:30.600> just<00:03:30.810> saw<00:03:31.050> what<00:03:31.890> an

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
as thick as this so we just saw what an

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.790 
as thick as this so we just saw what an
amazing<00:03:33.450> difference<00:03:33.840> making<00:03:34.290> your<00:03:34.500> pedal

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
amazing difference making your pedal

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.750 
amazing difference making your pedal
five<00:03:35.010> times<00:03:35.340> as<00:03:35.610> thick<00:03:35.880> does<00:03:36.830> now<00:03:37.830> try<00:03:38.370> one<00:03:38.580> is

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
five times as thick does now try one is

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.400 
five times as thick does now try one is
five<00:03:38.940> times<00:03:39.180> thinner<00:03:40.550> and<00:03:41.550> so<00:03:41.989> you've<00:03:42.989> thin

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
five times thinner and so you've thin

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.710 
five times thinner and so you've thin
this<00:03:43.620> out<00:03:43.800> set<00:03:44.220> it<00:03:44.340> on<00:03:44.430> there<00:03:44.670> and<00:03:44.850> also<00:03:45.540> you<00:03:45.600> I

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
this out set it on there and also you I

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.090 
this out set it on there and also you I
mean<00:03:45.840> it's<00:03:46.019> so<00:03:46.140> thin<00:03:46.410> here<00:03:46.590> you<00:03:46.769> don't<00:03:46.980> have

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
mean it's so thin here you don't have

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.490 
mean it's so thin here you don't have
your<00:03:47.190> usual<00:03:47.390> outboard<00:03:48.390> and<00:03:48.600> inboard<00:03:48.930> bearings

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
your usual outboard and inboard bearings

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.229 
your usual outboard and inboard bearings
they're<00:03:49.650> all<00:03:49.769> encased<00:03:50.459> in<00:03:50.670> the<00:03:50.730> crank<00:03:51.000> here

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
they're all encased in the crank here

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.790 
they're all encased in the crank here
yes<00:03:51.690> and<00:03:52.080> to<00:03:52.890> make<00:03:53.190> up<00:03:53.430> for<00:03:54.230> how<00:03:55.230> a<00:03:55.260> bearing
