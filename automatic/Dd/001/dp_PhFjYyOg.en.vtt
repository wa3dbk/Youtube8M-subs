hopped into the world of design let's

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.979 
hopped into the world of design let's
keep<00:03:24.430> on<00:03:24.639> board<00:03:25.030> that<00:03:25.180> train<00:03:25.419> what<00:03:25.750> else<00:03:25.900> do

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:25.989

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
the way it feels I love the design yeah

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.890 
the way it feels I love the design yeah
let's<00:03:51.519> talk<00:03:51.729> then<00:03:51.940> about<00:03:51.970> they<00:03:52.569> say<00:03:52.750> it's

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
let's talk then about they say it's

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.839 
let's talk then about they say it's
installable<00:03:53.470> in<00:03:53.769> a<00:03:53.859> router<00:03:54.040> table<00:03:54.579> did<00:03:54.760> you

00:03:54.839 --> 00:03:54.849 
installable in a router table did you

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:56.309 
installable in a router table did you
take<00:03:55.000> a<00:03:55.030> look<00:03:55.180> at<00:03:55.389> it<00:03:55.510> and<00:03:55.629> see<00:03:55.750> how<00:03:55.900> hard<00:03:56.260> that

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
take a look at it and see how hard that

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.589 
take a look at it and see how hard that
would<00:03:56.530> be<00:03:56.590> to<00:03:56.680> do<00:03:56.859> it's<00:03:57.549> very<00:03:57.819> easy<00:03:58.060> to<00:03:58.239> do<00:03:58.359> we

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599 
would be to do it's very easy to do we

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:00.539 
would be to do it's very easy to do we
have<00:03:58.780> a<00:03:58.810> router<00:03:59.109> table<00:03:59.349> at<00:03:59.620> the<00:03:59.739> shop<00:03:59.979> you

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
have a router table at the shop you

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:02.849 
have a router table at the shop you
remove<00:04:00.819> these<00:04:01.000> screws<00:04:01.239> and<00:04:01.510> put<00:04:02.470> it<00:04:02.560> up<00:04:02.650> under

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:02.859 
remove these screws and put it up under

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:04.170 
remove these screws and put it up under
your<00:04:02.979> table<00:04:03.250> and<00:04:03.310> screw<00:04:03.549> it<00:04:03.639> down<00:04:03.760> but<00:04:03.970> I<00:04:04.000> did

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
your table and screw it down but I did

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.059 
your table and screw it down but I did
not<00:04:04.329> try<00:04:04.569> it<00:04:04.599> okay<00:04:05.109> well<00:04:05.439> it<00:04:05.530> looks<00:04:05.799> like<00:04:05.859> it's

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:06.069 
not try it okay well it looks like it's

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:06.749 
not try it okay well it looks like it's
easy<00:04:06.189> enough<00:04:06.370> right

00:04:06.749 --> 00:04:06.759 
easy enough right

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:08.610 
easy enough right
yeah<00:04:06.939> okay<00:04:07.329> let's<00:04:07.540> talk<00:04:07.599> about<00:04:07.659> quality<00:04:08.259> the

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
yeah okay let's talk about quality the

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:09.960 
yeah okay let's talk about quality the
sound<00:04:08.859> of<00:04:09.099> the<00:04:09.159> motor<00:04:09.340> the<00:04:09.459> feel<00:04:09.759> of<00:04:09.790> the

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
sound of the motor the feel of the

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.699 
sound of the motor the feel of the
machine<00:04:10.239> as<00:04:10.419> far<00:04:10.569> as<00:04:10.689> vibration<00:04:11.229> and<00:04:11.379> all<00:04:11.470> that

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
machine as far as vibration and all that

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:13.379 
machine as far as vibration and all that
wondering<00:04:12.189> if<00:04:12.280> it's<00:04:12.400> put<00:04:12.579> together<00:04:12.729> tightly

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:13.389 
wondering if it's put together tightly

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:15.089 
wondering if it's put together tightly
what<00:04:14.109> do<00:04:14.199> you<00:04:14.259> think<00:04:14.379> about<00:04:14.470> the<00:04:14.680> long<00:04:14.829> haul

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:15.099 
what do you think about the long haul

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:17.279 
what do you think about the long haul
with<00:04:15.129> this<00:04:15.430> I<00:04:15.609> think<00:04:16.479> the<00:04:16.570> long<00:04:16.750> haul<00:04:17.019> will

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:17.289 
with this I think the long haul will

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:19.289 
with this I think the long haul will
this<00:04:17.739> will<00:04:17.859> be<00:04:17.950> the<00:04:18.039> last<00:04:18.219> router<00:04:18.549> alone

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
this will be the last router alone

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.240 
this will be the last router alone
it's<00:04:19.569> very<00:04:19.780> smooth<00:04:20.229> it<00:04:20.530> feels<00:04:20.829> like<00:04:21.099> it's

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.960 
it's very smooth it feels like it's
really<00:04:22.229> well-balanced<00:04:23.229> good<00:04:24.069> quality<00:04:24.550> motor

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
really well-balanced good quality motor

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.360 
really well-balanced good quality motor
tight<00:04:25.660> castings<00:04:26.319> it<00:04:26.620> just<00:04:26.830> it's<00:04:27.250> got

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
tight castings it just it's got

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.640 
tight castings it just it's got
rubberized<00:04:27.910> grips<00:04:28.330> here<00:04:28.720> it<00:04:29.380> just<00:04:29.560> feels

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:32.889 
really tough okay bottom line let's talk

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:34.469 
really tough okay bottom line let's talk
about<00:04:33.039> who<00:04:33.370> you<00:04:33.490> would<00:04:33.639> recommend<00:04:34.060> this<00:04:34.210> for

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 
about who you would recommend this for

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:36.870 
about who you would recommend this for
like<00:04:34.780> how<00:04:34.990> much<00:04:35.740> woodworking<00:04:36.430> would<00:04:36.580> you<00:04:36.699> need

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
like how much woodworking would you need

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.140 
like how much woodworking would you need
to<00:04:37.090> do<00:04:37.240> in<00:04:37.389> life<00:04:37.569> to<00:04:37.599> justify<00:04:38.410> this<00:04:38.729> I<00:04:39.729> think

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
to do in life to justify this I think

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.749 
to do in life to justify this I think
this<00:04:40.479> could<00:04:40.720> go<00:04:40.930> from<00:04:41.289> a<00:04:41.740> homeowner's<00:04:42.430> garage

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:42.759 
this could go from a homeowner's garage

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:45.150 
this could go from a homeowner's garage
shop<00:04:43.120> to<00:04:43.509> a<00:04:43.539> production<00:04:44.080> shop<00:04:44.289> I<00:04:44.590> think<00:04:44.889> it

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 
shop to a production shop I think it

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.770 
shop to a production shop I think it
would<00:04:45.250> handle<00:04:45.490> it<00:04:45.610> it's<00:04:45.880> a<00:04:45.970> lot<00:04:46.180> of<00:04:46.360> horsepower

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
would handle it it's a lot of horsepower

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.059 
would handle it it's a lot of horsepower
and<00:04:46.930> a<00:04:47.680> large<00:04:48.599> collet<00:04:49.599> I<00:04:49.870> wouldn't<00:04:50.800> be<00:04:50.860> afraid

00:04:51.059 --> 00:04:51.069 
and a large collet I wouldn't be afraid

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:52.649 
and a large collet I wouldn't be afraid
to<00:04:51.160> put<00:04:51.310> it<00:04:51.430> in<00:04:51.490> any<00:04:51.580> production<00:04:51.759> shop<00:04:52.180> okay

00:04:52.649 --> 00:04:52.659 
to put it in any production shop okay

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:53.760 
to put it in any production shop okay
then<00:04:52.840> let's<00:04:53.020> talk<00:04:53.050> about<00:04:53.199> the<00:04:53.409> dollars<00:04:53.740> and

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
then let's talk about the dollars and

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.499 
then let's talk about the dollars and
cents<00:04:54.130> there's<00:04:54.430> a<00:04:54.490> number<00:04:55.120> of<00:04:55.180> three<00:04:55.360> and<00:04:55.449> a

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:55.509 
cents there's a number of three and a

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:57.540 
cents there's a number of three and a
quarter<00:04:55.659> horse<00:04:55.930> routers<00:04:56.440> out<00:04:56.560> there<00:04:56.620> how

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
quarter horse routers out there how

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.159 
quarter horse routers out there how
would<00:04:57.699> this<00:04:57.819> stack<00:04:58.120> up<00:04:58.360> as<00:04:58.539> far<00:04:58.690> as<00:04:58.720> features

00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.169 
would this stack up as far as features

of the machine if I thought it would

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:11.820 
of the machine if I thought it would
have<00:05:09.819> cost<00:05:10.030> a<00:05:10.150> lot<00:05:10.300> more<00:05:10.360> yeah<00:05:10.990> all<00:05:11.409> right<00:05:11.560> you
