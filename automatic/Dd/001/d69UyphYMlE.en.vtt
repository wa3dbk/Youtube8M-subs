really oily so the the next step is to

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.950 
really oily so the the next step is to
kick<00:01:37.409> off<00:01:37.670> extra<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.729> preparation<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.479> first

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
best way to do this I was using some

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.970 
best way to do this I was using some
gimmicks<00:02:51.450> and<00:02:51.690> they<00:02:52.110> have<00:02:52.260> this<00:02:52.380> one<00:02:52.650> blade

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980

gimmicks and they have this one blade
that<00:02:53.850> actually<00:02:53.910> you<00:02:54.750> can<00:02:54.870> start<00:02:55.170> from<00:02:55.440> that

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
that actually you can start from that

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.870 
that actually you can start from that
instead<00:02:55.920> of<00:02:56.040> pulling<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.430> blade<00:02:56.640> through

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880
