00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:19.340
 one day I had a respiratory problem 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:21.420
 very strong and the situation was that I did not 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:25.710
 I could breathe 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.480
 I spent a terrible night felt that 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.270
 I was drowning that I was not dying 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.430
 There are many diseases related to 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:36.290
 tobacco use lung cancer 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.290
 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.790
 and acute myocardial infarction disease 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:45.020
 cerebrovascular or cerebrovascular event 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:49.080
 even diabetes very clearly is 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:51.510
 already recognized by the report of the 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.550
 general surgeon of the usa who is 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.020
 also linked to smoking pass a 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.270
 week to recover 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:01.730
 and then when I finish 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.730
 it was practically impossible to return 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.370
 to eat 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:09.460
 fear the fright 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:13.390
 and well my lungs no longer 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:16.530
 they resisted then if it is something 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.530
 dramatic smoking 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.460
 we see that they are starting to smoke before 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.280
 of 15 years of age and have some 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.229
 figures that show that a percentage 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.780
 that goes between 5 and 10 percent 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.899
 start smoking before 12 years of age 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.630
 the very high figure what are you 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:44.969
 statistics are telling us that the 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.310
 problem of the beginning of smoking is a 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:50.189
 pediatric disease problem in 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.770
 child age and it's about that age in the 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:56.399
 that we have to influence programs of 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:59.270
 prevention in education programs and 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.270
 health promotion 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.590
 smoking is important because it is the 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.179
 gateway to other addictions the 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.990
 probability that you will experiment with 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:15.210
 marijuana 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:17.560
 if you are a smoker it is like 1,400 times more 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.830
 when someone becomes a 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.480
 smoker has lost that freedom and believes 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.710
 the smoker who has the freedom to 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.450
 decide to smoke or not smoke and when that 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:32.940
 nicotine addict has no options 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.940
 the nicotine addict has to smoke
