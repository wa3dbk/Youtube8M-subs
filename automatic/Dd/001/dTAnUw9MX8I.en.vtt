00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
little bit of olive oil on them and just

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.340 
little bit of olive oil on them and just
a<00:00:47.789> little<00:00:48.000> bit<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.180> try<00:00:48.360> steak<00:00:48.660> rub<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.170> that's

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
it and we're just going to use a little

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.639 
it and we're just going to use a little
steak<00:00:51.239> rub<00:00:51.449> this<00:00:51.690> already<00:00:51.960> has<00:00:52.199> salt<00:00:52.440> and

steak rub this already has salt and

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:53.990 
steak rub this already has salt and
pepper<00:00:52.800> in<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.129> so<00:00:53.250> there's<00:00:53.430> no<00:00:53.550> reason<00:00:53.579> to

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
pepper in it so there's no reason to

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.279 
pepper in it so there's no reason to
over<00:00:54.930> salt<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.410> pepper<00:00:56.510> just<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.660> little<00:00:58.079> dry

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289

the grill all right just a couple of

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.100

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
thoughts about grilling steaks with

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.450 
thoughts about grilling steaks with
grill<00:01:07.409> grates<00:01:07.650> before<00:01:08.040> we<00:01:08.100> get<00:01:08.220> started

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
grill grates before we get started

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.700 
grill grates before we get started
number<00:01:09.180> one<00:01:09.510> if<00:01:09.780> you<00:01:09.930> like<00:01:10.140> your<00:01:10.380> steaks

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
number one if you like your steaks

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.250 
number one if you like your steaks
charred<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.640> blackened<00:01:11.840> Pittsburgh<00:01:12.840> style

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
charred and blackened Pittsburgh style

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.960 
charred and blackened Pittsburgh style
kind<00:01:13.920> of<00:01:13.979> crusty<00:01:14.430> on<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.549> outside

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
kind of crusty on the outside

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.940 
kind of crusty on the outside
don't<00:01:15.570> use<00:01:15.720> grill<00:01:15.990> grates<00:01:16.200> grill<00:01:16.740> grates

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
don't use grill grates grill grates

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.160 
don't use grill grates grill grates
impede<00:01:17.490> charring<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.119> don't<00:01:18.420> allow<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:18.840> to

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
impede charring and don't allow you to

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.560 
impede charring and don't allow you to
get<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.380> crust<00:01:19.860> so<00:01:20.520> that's<00:01:20.790> probably<00:01:21.060> one<00:01:21.540> of

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
get that crust so that's probably one of

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.270 
get that crust so that's probably one of
the<00:01:21.689> few<00:01:21.869> times<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.320> I<00:01:22.439> would<00:01:22.590> say<00:01:22.770> don't<00:01:23.100> use

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
the few times that I would say don't use

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.020 
the few times that I would say don't use
grill<00:01:23.610> grates

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
grill grates

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.539 
grill grates
so<00:01:24.659> if<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.080> like<00:01:25.290> them<00:01:25.500> sear<00:01:25.799> but<00:01:26.040> not<00:01:26.189> charred

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
so if you like them sear but not charred

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.380 
so if you like them sear but not charred
that's<00:01:27.180> what<00:01:27.330> we're<00:01:27.450> going<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.600> show

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390
