00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.350
 hello again girls I'm here today 

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:07.810
 I bring you a video about purchases on 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:10.389
 an order that I made to pure perfumery 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.969
 It's great if I remember correctly the page 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:14.320
 web is first point and I'm not very 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:16.539
 sure but good I'll put it down here 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:20.080
 on the information card and I bought 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:21.640
 three little things of the brand of palm that you 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.279
 I will teach below but good 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.990
 before a small paragraph and is that I do not know 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.150
 If you have noticed, I cut myself 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:30.970
 a little hair a little bit 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.829
 because I do not want to wear so many layers 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.649
 as I had previously because 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:38.110
 curls your hair too much and now 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:41.370
 he himself took him here and what 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:45.190
 try is to unify all the layers 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.860
 So, well, then, grow more 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.129
 even hair and well I'm very 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.360
 I also happy with a shine 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.280
 perfect to the hairdresser but good 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.309
 now I will add the three 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.590
 products that have been these three me 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:02.710
 I met the good brand because of seeing it in 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.510
 other girls on blogs and so on until 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.480
 they had good 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.730
 I believe that all val products 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:12.220
 with discount will not be a 20 a 23 for 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.740
 percent of the prices yes I do not 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.360
 agreement but good if I find it in the 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.670
 mail I'll put it down in the box 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.940
 information so that you know it or as 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.270
 annotation up here and well let's go 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.960
 begin with 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:31.070
 these translucent powders that are sexy 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.500
 mom and design 32 in powder 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.990
 here are the bread and it has 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.080
 delighted that it is true that good at 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.000
 being cardboard will spoil us 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.070
 much easier than if it were from another 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.350
 material but good packaging 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.600
 It's really like you see the girl there 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.780
 then backwards he also puts it on you 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.880
 well it comes as well as in an envelope not a 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.130
 envelope but another cardboard box 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:59.780
 here and then here is what is the 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:02.650
 package itself contains 70 8 grams what 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.650
 you can see here below 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:10.660
 like this is the packaging here takes a 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:13.200
 mirror and here are the powders 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.370
 Translucent are powders that do not give color 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.370
 but they are simply going to help us 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:22.680
 so that we do not shine 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:25.050
 I'm going to do a little bit all whites look 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.670
 they are like that 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:31.370
 but as you can see 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.379
 they do not add anything of color 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:37.860
 I take them right now and 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:40.080
 Well we'll see to see how they turn out 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:44.160
 this on the one hand comes the next 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:46.710
 product is this that is the breast serves 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.380
 blusher and eyeshadow and yes that 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:52.620
 it is true that it is almost a copy to 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.690
 blusher gas orgasms I do not have it 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.080
 here right now to show you the 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:00.360
 difference but good you can find it 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.970
 online or if you have it you will see that 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:06.600
 it's super similar also comes here the 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:09.540
 mirror and then here you have it 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:14.180
 Blusher is that I have already played in case 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.180
 You see it's like that and well the tone is 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.310
 this one here 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.290
 As you can see, it's super similar 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.170
 not to say almost identical to the garmins of 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:27.500
 nash and obviously it's a lot much 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:31.070
 cheaper here you have it and it contains 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:34.580
 70 8 grams the same as powders 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:36.980
 translucent and finally because the 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:40.130
 I did not really want to get excited either 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:43.290
 too much to ask for an illuminator in this 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:45.780
 case is the inhuman environment and being 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.080
 this there is another I do not remember the name 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.210
 Market Stall 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:54.280
 I do not remember exactly the name but 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:57.350
 it's almost the same but in another in another color 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:01.220
 the back is like this and 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:02.750
 contains 85 grams I have served a box 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:05.050
 of cardboard tour that I shut up is a 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.570
 normal cardboard box 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:10.260
 and the packaging comes from this 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:10.260
 plastic 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.950
 there you can see it 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:17.930
 it is a lovely golden illuminator I do not 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.570
 I know if you can appreciate it here it seems that 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:23.900
 It looks a little bit here in this 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:27.630
 part and look also takes here the 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:31.460
 mirror and is this 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.460
 I do not know if you can see the golden tone 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.100
 I do not know if you can appreciate the tone well 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.620
 golden that has but good I'm going to 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:41.650
 make a real swap with very little 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:44.680
 to apply it is very noticeable 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:47.560
 this here there seems to be that you can 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.560
 see better as you see super pigmented and 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:53.940
 I already tell you with very little amount 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:57.580
 can you illuminate the arch of the eyebrow 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:59.920

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.260
 in the 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:05.160
 in the lip area as you want is a 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:08.740
 Precious golden tone and contains 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:10.690
 a lot for the little bit that 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.090
 we are going to use so this can 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:15.220
 last practically all of life 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:18.100
 so I'm delighted I liked it 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:21.850
