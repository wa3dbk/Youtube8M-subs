00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:04.640 
well I've started a test this morning I

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.169 
well I've started a test this morning I
went<00:00:05.640> ahead<00:00:05.790> and<00:00:06.330> poured<00:00:07.140> water<00:00:07.529> into<00:00:08.179> these

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
went ahead and poured water into these

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.290 
went ahead and poured water into these
four<00:00:09.780> containers<00:00:10.410> these<00:00:10.920> are<00:00:11.099> both<00:00:11.340> plastic

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
four containers these are both plastic

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.120 
four containers these are both plastic
just<00:00:12.480> different<00:00:12.809> kinds<00:00:13.200> of<00:00:13.290> plastic<00:00:13.679> I'm<00:00:13.830> just

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
just different kinds of plastic I'm just

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.779 
just different kinds of plastic I'm just
be<00:00:14.490> using<00:00:14.790> containers<00:00:15.599> I<00:00:15.960> had<00:00:16.260> and<00:00:16.619> this<00:00:17.580> is<00:00:17.760> a

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
be using containers I had and this is a

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.700 
be using containers I had and this is a
glass<00:00:18.119> container<00:00:18.449> and<00:00:18.869> this<00:00:18.930> is<00:00:19.109> a<00:00:19.140> plastic

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
glass container and this is a plastic

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.640 
glass container and this is a plastic
cup<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.880> thing<00:00:21.390> with<00:00:21.539> this<00:00:21.660> plastic<00:00:22.170> cup<00:00:22.380> is

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
cup the thing with this plastic cup is

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.009 
cup the thing with this plastic cup is
it<00:00:23.189> does<00:00:23.670> have<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:23.910> little<00:00:24.210> straw<00:00:24.510> hole<00:00:24.720> on<00:00:24.930> the

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
it does have a little straw hole on the

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.320 
it does have a little straw hole on the
top<00:00:25.260> so<00:00:26.010> I'm<00:00:26.220> just<00:00:26.939> testing<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.420> see<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:29.330> poured

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
top so I'm just testing to see I poured

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.160 
top so I'm just testing to see I poured
this<00:00:30.449> water<00:00:30.750> at<00:00:30.960> 8:00<00:00:31.199> this<00:00:31.890> morning<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:33.170> I'm

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
this water at 8:00 this morning and I'm

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.220 
this water at 8:00 this morning and I'm
testing<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.770> see<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.219> there<00:00:35.640> any<00:00:36.230> difference

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
testing to see is there any difference

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.490 
testing to see is there any difference
in<00:00:37.610> the<00:00:39.410> water<00:00:40.410> alkaline<00:00:41.340> level<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:42.030> also<00:00:42.930> in

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
in the water alkaline level and also in

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.160 
in the water alkaline level and also in
the<00:00:43.920> ORP<00:00:44.760> level<00:00:46.010> it's<00:00:47.010> now<00:00:47.309> about<00:00:47.579> 12:30<00:00:48.450> so

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
the ORP level it's now about 12:30 so

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.319 
the ORP level it's now about 12:30 so
that's<00:00:49.469> four<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:50.010> half<00:00:50.070> hours<00:00:50.579> loop<00:00:50.850> that

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
that's four and a half hours loop that

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.200 
that's four and a half hours loop that
it's<00:00:51.989> been<00:00:52.260> sitting<00:00:52.559> in<00:00:52.620> these<00:00:52.800> models<00:00:53.280> now

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
it's been sitting in these models now

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.540 
it's been sitting in these models now
all<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:55.050> this<00:00:55.199> water<00:00:55.469> was<00:00:55.800> poured<00:00:56.129> at<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.309> same

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
all of this water was poured at the same

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.189 
all of this water was poured at the same
time<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.600> was<00:00:57.780> about<00:00:58.399> 11.25<00:00:59.399> pH<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.390> the

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
time and it was about 11.25 pH and the

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:07.690 
time and it was about 11.25 pH and the
RP<00:01:01.770> was<00:01:02.010> about<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.489> 2<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.329> negative<00:01:03.979> 295<00:01:05.540> so<00:01:06.540> let's

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
RP was about a 2 a negative 295 so let's

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.609 
RP was about a 2 a negative 295 so let's
check<00:01:08.700> this<00:01:08.880> plastic<00:01:09.810> bottle<00:01:10.020> here<00:01:10.790> this<00:01:11.790> is<00:01:12.030> I

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
check this plastic bottle here this is I

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:15.649 
check this plastic bottle here this is I
couldn't<00:01:13.619> see<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:13.830> number<00:01:14.159> on<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:15.540> know

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
couldn't see a number on the you know

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.469 
couldn't see a number on the you know
they<00:01:15.990> have<00:01:16.140> no<00:01:16.470> little<00:01:17.070> triangles<00:01:17.580> on<00:01:17.790> usually

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
they have no little triangles on usually

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.749 
they have no little triangles on usually
on<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.689> bottom<00:01:19.049> with<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.409> number<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.100> I

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
on the bottom with a number and I

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.289 
on the bottom with a number and I
couldn't<00:01:21.119> see<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.420> number<00:01:22.400> or<00:01:23.400> maybe<00:01:23.909> there<00:01:24.210> is

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
couldn't see a number or maybe there is

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.429 
couldn't see a number or maybe there is
a<00:01:24.330> number<00:01:24.600> there<00:01:24.869> one<00:01:25.439> okay<00:01:26.310> anyway<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.439> don't

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
a number there one okay anyway I don't

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.600 
a number there one okay anyway I don't
know<00:01:28.619> if<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:28.890> makes<00:01:29.100> any<00:01:29.280> difference<00:01:29.549> but

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
know if that makes any difference but

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:44.580 
know if that makes any difference but
testing<00:01:32.720> pH<00:01:33.720> first

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.960 

okay<00:01:45.590> so<00:01:46.060> that<00:01:47.060> was<00:01:47.150> about<00:01:47.860> 11.25<00:01:48.920> earlier<00:01:49.549> I

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
okay so that was about 11.25 earlier I

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:57.340 
okay so that was about 11.25 earlier I
mean<00:01:50.509> at<00:01:50.690> eight<00:01:51.580> and<00:01:55.090> now<00:01:56.140> four<00:01:57.140> and<00:01:57.170> a<00:01:57.290> half

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
mean at eight and now four and a half

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.780 
mean at eight and now four and a half
hours<00:01:57.770> later<00:01:58.390> it's<00:01:59.390> about<00:02:00.040> eleven<00:02:01.040> point

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
hours later it's about eleven point

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.499 
hours later it's about eleven point
oh<00:02:01.880> one<00:02:02.920> so<00:02:03.920> that's<00:02:04.040> not<00:02:04.310> too<00:02:04.580> bad<00:02:04.759> it's<00:02:05.240> pretty

gonna pour this back in let this sit for

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.780 
gonna pour this back in let this sit for
a<00:02:40.670> little<00:02:40.880> longer

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
a little longer

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:49.270 
a little longer
let<00:02:43.790> it<00:02:43.910> sit<00:02:44.150> for<00:02:44.180> a<00:02:44.780> day<00:02:46.420> or<00:02:47.420> day<00:02:47.660> or<00:02:47.810> two<00:02:48.280> see

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
let it sit for a day or day or two see

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.730 
let it sit for a day or day or two see
what<00:02:49.550> kind<00:02:49.790> of<00:02:49.880> changes<00:02:50.300> are<00:02:50.510> made<00:02:53.290> all<00:02:54.290> right

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
what kind of changes are made all right

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.260 
what kind of changes are made all right
that's<00:02:55.310> a<00:02:55.930> big<00:02:56.930> plastic<00:02:57.260> bottle<00:02:58.040> now<00:02:59.030> let's

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
that's a big plastic bottle now let's

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.970 
that's a big plastic bottle now let's
check<00:02:59.720> and<00:02:59.990> see<00:03:00.350> what<00:03:01.340> the<00:03:02.500> changes<00:03:03.500> are<00:03:03.680> in

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
check and see what the changes are in

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:12.970 
check and see what the changes are in
this<00:03:10.660> favor<00:03:11.660> they<00:03:12.110> seem<00:03:12.410> to<00:03:12.620> be<00:03:12.740> different

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
this favor they seem to be different

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.400 
this favor they seem to be different
kinds<00:03:13.550> of<00:03:13.730> plastic<00:03:14.330> to<00:03:14.510> me<00:03:14.660> so<00:03:14.930> that's<00:03:15.050> why<00:03:15.380> I

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
kinds of plastic to me so that's why I

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.340 
kinds of plastic to me so that's why I
was<00:03:15.830> testing<00:03:16.490> different<00:03:16.700> cuttings<00:03:17.270> this<00:03:18.200> is

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
was testing different cuttings this is

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.490 
was testing different cuttings this is
like<00:03:18.470> a<00:03:18.500> thinner<00:03:18.890> plastic<00:03:19.730> and<00:03:20.110> this<00:03:21.110> is<00:03:21.290> like

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
like a thinner plastic and this is like

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.230 
like a thinner plastic and this is like
a<00:03:21.530> thicker<00:03:22.250> plastic<00:03:24.100> so<00:03:25.100> just<00:03:25.790> for

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:26.240 
a thicker plastic so just for

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.710 
a thicker plastic so just for
consistency<00:03:26.440> I'll<00:03:27.440> start<00:03:27.740> with<00:03:27.860> the<00:03:27.980> pH<00:03:28.720> I'll

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
consistency I'll start with the pH I'll

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.110 
consistency I'll start with the pH I'll
try<00:03:29.960> to<00:03:30.020> remember<00:03:30.290> to<00:03:30.470> do<00:03:30.650> that<00:03:30.890> each<00:03:31.100> time<00:03:31.130> all

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
try to remember to do that each time all

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:41.860 
try to remember to do that each time all
right<00:03:32.360> so<00:03:32.750> we're<00:03:33.170> starting<00:03:33.440> out<00:03:33.830> with<00:03:40.870> looks

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
right so we're starting out with looks

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:55.780 
right so we're starting out with looks
like<00:03:42.170> about<00:03:43.390> 11<00:03:44.390> pH<00:03:45.910> and<00:03:47.230> ORP<00:03:54.459> looks<00:03:55.459> like

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
like about 11 pH and ORP looks like

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:03.760 
like about 11 pH and ORP looks like
about<00:03:56.650> minus<00:03:58.090> 270<00:04:00.130> approximately<00:04:02.050> and<00:04:03.050> that

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:03.770 
about minus 270 approximately and that

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.190 
about minus 270 approximately and that
is<00:04:03.920> the<00:04:04.100> thinner<00:04:04.340> plastic<00:04:04.940> so<00:04:05.239> maybe<00:04:05.780> there<00:04:06.050> is

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
is the thinner plastic so maybe there is

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.370 
is the thinner plastic so maybe there is
some<00:04:06.530> more<00:04:06.800> just<00:04:08.140> evaporation<00:04:09.140> of<00:04:09.230> the

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
some more just evaporation of the

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.860 
some more just evaporation of the
hydrogen<00:04:10.300> happening<00:04:11.300> in<00:04:11.420> that<00:04:11.540> thinner

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
hydrogen happening in that thinner

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.820 
hydrogen happening in that thinner
plastic<00:04:12.440> bottle<00:04:12.830> I<00:04:13.360> guess<00:04:14.360> I'm<00:04:14.870> not<00:04:15.050> sure<00:04:15.350> what

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
plastic bottle I guess I'm not sure what

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.430 
plastic bottle I guess I'm not sure what
the<00:04:15.950> reason<00:04:16.070> is<00:04:16.400> that<00:04:16.850> that<00:04:17.120> thing<00:04:17.419> seems<00:04:18.230> to

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
the reason is that that thing seems to

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:31.810 
the reason is that that thing seems to
be<00:04:18.530> a<00:04:18.560> little<00:04:20.230> worse<00:04:21.230> than<00:04:23.919> for<00:04:24.919> this<00:04:25.070> back<00:04:25.340> in

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:36.080 

kind<00:04:32.820> of<00:04:32.880> locked<00:04:33.180> somewhere<00:04:33.570> out<00:04:33.900> there<00:04:35.090> all

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
kind of locked somewhere out there all

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:44.120 
kind of locked somewhere out there all
right<00:04:36.330> the<00:04:37.290> next<00:04:37.470> one<00:04:37.860> is<00:04:39.440> the<00:04:40.440> last<00:04:43.070> this<00:04:44.070> is

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
right the next one is the last this is

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.050 
right the next one is the last this is
any<00:04:44.490> better<00:04:44.930> lot<00:04:45.930> of<00:04:46.020> times<00:04:46.260> people<00:04:46.680> are<00:04:46.800> like

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
any better lot of times people are like

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.820 
any better lot of times people are like
thinking<00:04:48.060> glass<00:04:48.630> is<00:04:48.960> a<00:04:49.080> lot<00:04:49.260> better<00:04:49.560> than

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
thinking glass is a lot better than

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.540 
thinking glass is a lot better than
plastic<00:04:50.100> so<00:04:50.930> the<00:04:51.930> interesting<00:04:52.350> thing<00:04:52.920> to

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
plastic so the interesting thing to

00:04:53.550 --> 00:05:08.300 
plastic so the interesting thing to
observe<00:04:54.320> and<00:04:55.320> we'll<00:04:55.620> start<00:04:55.920> with<00:04:56.070> pH<00:05:06.620> okay<00:05:07.620> so

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
observe and we'll start with pH okay so

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:17.720 
observe and we'll start with pH okay so
the<00:05:08.460> pH<00:05:09.740> it's<00:05:10.740> about<00:05:12.230> 11<00:05:13.230> on<00:05:14.100> this<00:05:14.310> one<00:05:15.380> and<00:05:16.730> it

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:17.730 
the pH it's about 11 on this one and it

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.330 
the pH it's about 11 on this one and it
doesn't<00:05:17.940> seem<00:05:18.800> significantly<00:05:19.800> different

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
doesn't seem significantly different

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:25.330 
doesn't seem significantly different
than<00:05:20.520> the<00:05:20.670> plastic<00:05:20.880> so<00:05:21.660> far<00:05:22.430> and<00:05:23.900> the<00:05:24.900> ORP

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
than the plastic so far and the ORP

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:31.250 
than the plastic so far and the ORP
looks<00:05:26.340> like<00:05:26.700> it's<00:05:27.680> three<00:05:28.680> negative<00:05:29.520> 330<00:05:30.260> so

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:31.260 
looks like it's three negative 330 so

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:35.659 
looks like it's three negative 330 so
it's<00:05:31.650> really<00:05:32.180> maintained<00:05:33.560> its<00:05:34.669> original

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:35.669 
it's really maintained its original

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.640 
it's really maintained its original
pretty<00:05:36.060> much<00:05:36.270> its<00:05:36.510> original<00:05:37.020> ORP<00:05:37.500> is

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
pretty much its original ORP is

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:43.480 
pretty much its original ORP is
maintained<00:05:38.220> so<00:05:38.520> that's<00:05:39.450> nothing<00:05:40.260> interesting

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.470 

observation<00:05:44.490> I<00:05:44.550> wonder<00:05:44.880> if<00:05:44.970> that's<00:05:45.180> going<00:05:45.419> to

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:45.480 
observation I wonder if that's going to

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:49.310 
observation I wonder if that's going to
continue<00:05:45.840> then<00:05:46.320> if<00:05:46.530> we<00:05:46.710> let<00:05:47.100> it<00:05:48.260> let<00:05:49.260> it

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 
continue then if we let it let it

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.920 
continue then if we let it let it
continue<00:05:49.890> soaking<00:05:50.520> another<00:05:50.970> day<00:05:51.300> and<00:05:51.720> see

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:51.930 
continue soaking another day and see

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:53.980 
continue soaking another day and see
what<00:05:52.080> happens

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990 
what happens

00:05:53.990 --> 00:06:00.670 
what happens
metaphoric<00:05:54.990> stays<00:05:57.530> negative<00:05:58.530> range<00:05:58.770> which<00:05:59.580> is

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680 
metaphoric stays negative range which is

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:07.070 
metaphoric stays negative range which is
really<00:06:01.680> really<00:06:01.890> good<00:06:05.510> all<00:06:06.510> right

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 
really really good all right

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.460 
really really good all right
the<00:06:07.680> last<00:06:08.480> one<00:06:09.480> I<00:06:09.510> don't<00:06:09.810> need<00:06:09.990> this<00:06:10.169> little

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:10.470 
the last one I don't need this little

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:16.100 
the last one I don't need this little
class<00:06:10.950> for<00:06:11.810> because<00:06:12.810> the<00:06:13.610> it's<00:06:14.610> a<00:06:14.760> cup<00:06:15.030> and<00:06:15.690> the

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.110 
class for because the it's a cup and the

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:19.610 
class for because the it's a cup and the
meter<00:06:16.680> will<00:06:17.100> just<00:06:17.370> fit<00:06:17.669> right<00:06:17.940> in<00:06:18.180> it<00:06:18.440> so<00:06:19.440> we'll

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:19.620 
meter will just fit right in it so we'll

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:26.570 
meter will just fit right in it so we'll
start<00:06:19.950> out<00:06:20.130> with<00:06:20.460> the<00:06:20.640> pH

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.570 

this<00:06:27.509> I<00:06:27.689> wasn't<00:06:28.110> expecting<00:06:28.680> to<00:06:28.860> have<00:06:29.099> as<00:06:29.310> good

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:29.580 
this I wasn't expecting to have as good

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.670 
this I wasn't expecting to have as good
results<00:06:30.180> as<00:06:30.330> the<00:06:30.479> others<00:06:30.810> because<00:06:31.259> it<00:06:31.439> had

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 
results as the others because it had

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:37.790 
results as the others because it had
that<00:06:31.949> little<00:06:32.189> straw<00:06:32.580> hole<00:06:32.849> on<00:06:33.060> top<00:06:35.120> and<00:06:36.800> that

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:37.800 
that little straw hole on top and that

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:46.999 
that little straw hole on top and that
is<00:06:39.259> ten<00:06:40.259> point<00:06:40.650> nine<00:06:40.800> four<00:06:42.530> and<00:06:43.580> then<00:06:44.580> a<00:06:45.680> lot<00:06:46.680> P

00:06:46.999 --> 00:06:47.009 
is ten point nine four and then a lot P

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:53.089 
is ten point nine four and then a lot P
oh<00:06:48.979> it's<00:06:49.979> alright<00:06:50.219> it's<00:06:50.610> waterproof<00:06:51.060> and<00:06:52.099> the

00:06:53.089 --> 00:06:53.099 
oh it's alright it's waterproof and the

00:06:53.099 --> 00:07:07.730 
oh it's alright it's waterproof and the
ORP<00:06:53.520> is<00:06:57.500> about<00:06:58.500> a<00:06:58.889> negative<00:07:02.659> 207<00:07:03.680> feet<00:07:06.469> okay

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:07.740 
ORP is about a negative 207 feet okay

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:13.550 
ORP is about a negative 207 feet okay
well<00:07:08.599> that<00:07:10.789> that<00:07:11.789> does<00:07:12.090> that<00:07:12.330> well<00:07:12.599> we'll<00:07:13.349> keep

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:13.560 
well that that does that well we'll keep

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:18.830 
well that that does that well we'll keep
these<00:07:13.979> certain<00:07:14.759> now<00:07:17.000> I'll<00:07:18.000> test<00:07:18.330> them<00:07:18.509> again

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:18.840 
these certain now I'll test them again

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:21.640 
these certain now I'll test them again
tomorrow<00:07:19.379> at<00:07:20.159> about<00:07:20.639> 8:00<00:07:21.210> in<00:07:21.419> the<00:07:21.479> morning
