00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.460
 and of course 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.790
 na 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.010
 thank you for coming here today and for 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.220
 make me sweat a little with you 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.220
 questions 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.620
 let me say that I appreciate that you have 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.340
 come some of you from media 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.340
 international 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.900
 I just would not have believed it if I 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.460
 they say 25 years ago if I had had a 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.920
 crystal ball that will show me what 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.900
 it was going to happen 25 years later that 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.640
 someone was going to remember everything I did 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.080
 in his day and by connecting it with the 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.080
 present I would not have believed it 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.640
 we did not have the means with the 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.289
 that there are now new ways of 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.539
 video the motion captures 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:27.710
 etcetera and is something that I would have 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:27.710
 liked to have counted 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.580
 in fact I have seen the triple h that is 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.770
 there in the corner like a little boy 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.010
 again while they were filming us for the 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.010
 game 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.700
 we did not have any of that but 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.049
 now we have video games and they arise 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.790
 new ways to use those 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.720
 characters and that people can 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.720
 enjoy them yet 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.320
 and all I want to thank 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.510
 developers to journalists to 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.979
 the industry to critics thank you 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.940
 to them the developers can 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.940
 improve and so on 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.110
 Now that I'm with you, you can 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.630
 ask me questions there are no restrictions 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.920
 except some that you already know senses 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.920
 free to ask me what you want 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.850
 i 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.740
 I want to thank everyone in two 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.330
 that he had never played a video game 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.130
 before but I have been told that it is the 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.780
 first time the character of ultimate 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.780
 warrior appears in this franchise 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.820
 it is an exclusive character of the 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.160
 reservation which means that if you do the 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.350
 game reserve will now be awarded a 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.300
 token that you can use to select a 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.660
 ultimate warrior in different modes 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.660
 of game 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.600
 yes 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.600
 I think it's quite exciting not 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.519
 now wait for some feedback 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.879
 your part and that you do justice to me 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.879
 character
