00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
letting it air dry naturally this is the

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.240 
letting it air dry naturally this is the
color<00:05:15.000> it<00:05:15.120> turned<00:05:15.600> out<00:05:15.810> it's<00:05:16.350> kind<00:05:16.680> of<00:05:16.770> like<00:05:16.979> an

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
color it turned out it's kind of like an

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.050 
color it turned out it's kind of like an
orange<00:05:18.030> II<00:05:18.330> reddish<00:05:19.139> brown<00:05:19.830> which<00:05:20.580> I<00:05:20.850> mean

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
orange II reddish brown which I mean

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.480 
orange II reddish brown which I mean
it's<00:05:21.240> a<00:05:21.300> really<00:05:21.479> pretty<00:05:21.720> color<00:05:21.870> but<00:05:22.560> I<00:05:22.830> don't

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
it's a really pretty color but I don't

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.240 
it's a really pretty color but I don't
think<00:05:23.700> it's<00:05:24.150> the<00:05:24.750> description<00:05:25.350> of<00:05:25.560> a<00:05:25.950> light

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
think it's the description of a light

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.580 
think it's the description of a light
golden<00:05:26.760> brown<00:05:27.000> and<00:05:27.570> it<00:05:27.750> certainly<00:05:28.080> isn't<00:05:28.320> the

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
golden brown and it certainly isn't the

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.820 
golden brown and it certainly isn't the
picture<00:05:28.800> that's<00:05:29.419> that's<00:05:30.419> on<00:05:30.630> the<00:05:30.810> box<00:05:31.020> however

kind of tricky and I feel like that was

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.260 
kind of tricky and I feel like that was
a<00:05:55.080> little<00:05:55.349> misleading<00:05:55.530> and<00:05:56.070> if<00:05:56.789> people<00:05:57.150> aren't

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:57.270 
a little misleading and if people aren't

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:59.690 
a little misleading and if people aren't
really<00:05:57.539> paying<00:05:57.690> attention<00:05:58.380> to<00:05:59.070> their<00:05:59.460> current

really paying attention to their current
hair<00:05:59.970> color<00:06:00.180> and<00:06:00.419> how<00:06:00.570> it<00:06:00.720> might<00:06:00.960> turn<00:06:01.289> out<00:06:01.349> I

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
hair color and how it might turn out I

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.340 
hair color and how it might turn out I
think<00:06:02.280> they<00:06:02.430> would<00:06:02.580> really<00:06:02.610> end

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:03.350 
think they would really end

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:05.350 
think they would really end
what<00:06:03.470> my<00:06:03.560> hair<00:06:03.710> color<00:06:03.920> they<00:06:04.130> didn't<00:06:04.430> want<00:06:04.640> but

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360 
what my hair color they didn't want but

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.950 
what my hair color they didn't want but
I<00:06:05.630> think<00:06:05.990> that<00:06:06.230> you<00:06:06.980> know<00:06:07.130> you<00:06:07.190> stay<00:06:07.670> with<00:06:08.360> the

think that was right that was like
really<00:06:15.140> really<00:06:15.410> spot-on
