lid that you find on most small cars
this<00:03:15.350> is<00:03:15.560> completely<00:03:15.980> made<00:03:16.130> of<00:03:16.280> glass<00:03:16.459> so

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:16.700 
this is completely made of glass so

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.250 
this is completely made of glass so
basically<00:03:17.180> the<00:03:17.330> windshield<00:03:17.750> and<00:03:17.870> the

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
basically the windshield and the

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.759 
basically the windshield and the
it<00:03:18.530> is<00:03:18.680> one<00:03:19.189> unit<00:03:19.430> one<00:03:20.060> big<00:03:20.569> glass<00:03:20.900> and<00:03:21.260> then

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
it is one unit one big glass and then

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.500 
it is one unit one big glass and then
you<00:03:21.860> come<00:03:22.040> to<00:03:22.159> the<00:03:22.250> tail<00:03:22.430> light<00:03:22.610> it's<00:03:23.269> a

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
you come to the tail light it's a

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.119 
you come to the tail light it's a
trapezoidal<00:03:24.170> shape<00:03:24.290> so<00:03:24.650> basically<00:03:24.980> it

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:25.129 
trapezoidal shape so basically it

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:27.250 
trapezoidal shape so basically it
doesn't<00:03:25.280> go<00:03:25.610> well<00:03:26.000> with<00:03:26.209> the<00:03:26.689> rest<00:03:26.870> of<00:03:27.019> the<00:03:27.110> car

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
doesn't go well with the rest of the car

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.899 
doesn't go well with the rest of the car
because<00:03:27.530> it<00:03:27.620> just<00:03:27.829> looks<00:03:27.980> out<00:03:28.099> of<00:03:28.189> place<00:03:28.400> and

00:03:28.899 --> 00:03:28.909 
because it just looks out of place and

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:31.330 
because it just looks out of place and
so<00:03:29.689> if<00:03:29.780> you<00:03:29.870> look<00:03:30.019> at<00:03:30.140> the<00:03:30.230> tailgate<00:03:30.620> you

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
so if you look at the tailgate you

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.030 
so if you look at the tailgate you
either<00:03:31.489> love<00:03:31.790> it<00:03:31.819> or<00:03:31.939> you<00:03:32.269> hate<00:03:32.569> it<00:03:32.739> if<00:03:33.739> you<00:03:33.799> ask

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
either love it or you hate it if you ask

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.890 
either love it or you hate it if you ask
me<00:03:34.280> I<00:03:34.489> think<00:03:34.849> it<00:03:35.150> looks<00:03:35.329> stunning<00:03:36.489> at<00:03:37.599> the<00:03:38.599> back

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900
