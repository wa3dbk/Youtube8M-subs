00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.480
 Food Tube, everyone, everyone. 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.200
 I am Jamie Oliver. 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.200
 Today we are going to open a stove in Australia. 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.060
 Look at the Sydney Opera House behind me. 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.160
 Nothing is better than this! 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.240
 We want to make simple, delicious BBQ crispy prawns today. 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.533
 Add some delicious garlic bread and smoked bacon 

00:00:15.533 --> 00:00:17.733
 And the people who want to do with us are not yours. 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:18.840
 Tobie Puttock 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.440
 Tell us about this to be done later. 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.654
 I feel that if you are not doing this dish in front of the opera house today, 

00:00:29.654 --> 00:00:31.355
 It seems that I can’t say it, isn’t it? 

00:00:31.355 --> 00:00:32.054
 We are in Australia... 

00:00:32.054 --> 00:00:32.994
 Yes, I can’t say a bit. 

00:00:32.994 --> 00:00:35.935
 First, let's take some rosemary branches. 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.340
 We want to use them to make forks 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.500
 Use the rosemary stem to make a fork to increase the aroma 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.480
 We love it very much. 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.074
 Remember when we made this dish 

00:00:43.237 --> 00:00:44.957
 It seems that the scallops and the prawn are on the rosemary. 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.740
 Once I didn't have scallops, so I switched to crispy Italian bread. 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.615
 Then push it to the end like this. 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.240
 Now we are using prawns, 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.940
 But in fact you can use other things like 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.720
 Scallops, squid, and white fish grilled with your shellfish 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.535
 When we start to bake this, the oil will melt and be absorbed by the bread. 

00:01:00.535 --> 00:01:03.315
 Add flavor to your dishes 

00:01:03.315 --> 00:01:05.835
 It’s a bit like a super garlic bread enhanced version, right 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.160
 Come again, I have some cold pressed olive oil here. 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.520
 Or virgin olive oil, you can put a chopped garlic inside. 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:13.600
 Salt and pepper 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.440
 Then there are some rosemary that I just folded in half. 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.995
 Take them as brushes 

00:01:17.995 --> 00:01:19.640
 Before I started recording, 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.560
 I heated these up a little, um... about 2~3 minutes. 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.480
 Just let the olive oil not be cold. 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.514
 Of course, let the taste of garlic into the oil to taste 

00:01:26.514 --> 00:01:28.994
 And the aroma of rosemary will be 

00:01:28.994 --> 00:01:31.453
 We went into our food when we started baking. 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.400
 I want to put this in the middle of the shrimp now. 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.460
 Hey... can I steal a little of your oil? Can you use it? 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.280
 I don't think we need to do too much seasoning, need it, Toby? 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.280
 Um... our oil is already seasoned. 

00:01:42.334 --> 00:01:42.834
 OK 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.580
 of course, 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.200
 Can we add some materials later and put them in directly? Correct 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.300
 Simultaneously, 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.020
 I have a lemon that has just been roasted slightly here. 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.640
 Everyone knows the taste of lemon 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.748
 But many people don't know or ignore 

00:01:53.748 --> 00:01:55.234
 Sugar in the lemon 

00:01:55.234 --> 00:01:57.960
 Is the part that will be caramelized when you roast the lemon 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.574
 This will change its taste composition 

00:02:00.574 --> 00:02:03.069
 Will become softer and of course sweeter 

00:02:03.276 --> 00:02:05.856
 You make it a bit focus 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.400
 awesome! 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.394
 Let it slowly mature 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.920
 I think we can turn over, I guess. 

00:02:11.835 --> 00:02:15.995
 I usually pick it up from the side and let the head of the shrimp head to the other side. 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.420
 Then... look at it 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.380
 beautiful! It looks great, isn't it? 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.508
 When I am here, I am going to the table. 

00:02:22.508 --> 00:02:23.502
 I will use some fresh lemons. 

00:02:23.502 --> 00:02:24.840
 Be careful when you do this. 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.340
 Because lemon juice will become very hot when grilled 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.534
 I will squeeze some up. 

00:02:28.534 --> 00:02:31.120
 Squeeze some on the skewer before going to the table 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.553
 A bit like jam, right? 

00:02:32.553 --> 00:02:33.489
 Cool, right? 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:34.714
 This will be delicious, brother 

00:02:34.714 --> 00:02:35.494
 It will be delicious 

00:02:35.494 --> 00:02:36.740
 I think it is great now. 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.620
 And its color is also very beautiful 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.153
 What awesome, Toby. 

00:02:41.153 --> 00:02:42.455
 You can also look at this rosemary, 

00:02:42.455 --> 00:02:43.709
 In fact, we can already eat. 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.500
 Can you sprinkle a little more on it? 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:46.494
 It’s delicious, oh, ok. 

00:02:46.494 --> 00:02:47.434
 Add it to cover it 

00:02:47.434 --> 00:02:48.174
 Some delicious lemons at home 

00:02:48.174 --> 00:02:51.068
 If you want, you can add a little bit of this olive oil. 

00:02:52.414 --> 00:02:54.254
 Also added to the top 

00:02:54.374 --> 00:02:55.094
 Pretty 

00:02:55.094 --> 00:02:55.675
 Cool? 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.740
 Finished, everyone. Super simple 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.274
 You just put it on the barbecue 

00:02:59.274 --> 00:03:01.214
 Then it’s done 

00:03:01.214 --> 00:03:02.934

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.217
 You can ask him questions, he will return you 

00:03:08.294 --> 00:03:10.234
 Use him like me, abuse him 

00:03:10.295 --> 00:03:10.935
 come on 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.480
 Eat a little? 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.280
 Okay 

00:03:14.274 --> 00:03:15.394
 I want to eat the above 

00:03:15.394 --> 00:03:16.163
 I want to take this big one. 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:19.540
 Oh my God 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.280
 Rosemary with seafood 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.130
 Was completely underestimated before 

00:03:25.475 --> 00:03:26.515
 They are a natural pair. 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.600
 awesome 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:29.760
 very delicious 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.300
 We are at the Sydney Opera House 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.934
 Take care 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.440
 If you like this recipe, give me a "like" 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.208
 Try to do it. 

00:03:35.208 --> 00:03:37.575
 Have fun, we will see you next time, take care
