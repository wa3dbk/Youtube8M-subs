00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:02.890
 Nwanze 

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:05.890
 I have a lot of respect for trout 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.880
 because I lived my only story of friendship with a woman through a 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.999
 trout 

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:15.999
 we can smoke 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:21.789
 I do not know who said between love and friendship that welcomes carabins 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:25.919
 what's more, the month when marseille-provence 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.519
 I think it's March the l1 

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:34.019
 what I always thought she and her men women 

00:00:34.019 --> 00:00:38.449
 was immediately criticized the Franco-German friendship between early 40 and 5 44 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.770
 course the mitis and albi not sarkozy between early May and 11 4 billion euros 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.730
 this year 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.580
 yes to a seizure of magazines between july and rossi cg06 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.480
 I have never crossed dairy there 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.310
 until the day I met a middle-aged woman at the fishmonger department 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:02.540
 from the cheap 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.870
 she asks for a large paschal smoke trout organized in those concerning 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.870
 whose chief agent would be schubert trout 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.090
 we had asked for a huge trout per hundred people 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.820
 each for epiphytes 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.080
 for the near-east answered percent people to go the project a 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.080
 whale 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.470
 she retorted firmly that by sfr for chipperfield the dead passed 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.280
 at 30 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.540
 I was waiting for croquettes ans 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.540
 because the avocados ripens the maturity 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.490
 but good as I am good enough for the words of garmin 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.750
 I started taking out balloons 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.750
 you know that when you do not work in the water 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.560
 it's a debate 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.030
 as she was at 1,800 meters in the cold at 800 square meters in the 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.189
 16th summer not usual kind of humor 

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:17.539
 some items published on the floor 

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:21.059
 so she tells me to listen came to my house I'm organizing a private concert of 

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:24.059
 chamberlain and after I do a little snack 

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:29.869
 abily and I did not understand coagulation 

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:42.729
 so a month 

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:44.979
 so I said to m 

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:47.349
 but the man that 

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:50.349
 the device will have the world around 

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:56.089
 they even 300 people 

00:02:57.249 --> 00:03:00.249
 not chamber by year there is an inconsistency with trout 

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:04.039
 so I said but why especially after trout 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.959
 it's not singer me if so if I insist 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.699
 Empress 

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:15.069
 now I'm maintaining in the village directly dependent on the 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.279
 search are addicted to gold prices but we 

00:03:18.279 --> 00:03:19.990
 but continues his speech 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.990
 you know me I've been doing this for ten years they're all coming 

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:27.599
 there the fishmonger a knee out of this unlikely duel 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:30.599
 a big job for your snack 

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:34.159
 and in fact that's where I understood why today we say it's 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:37.449
 rather aperitif dinner 

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:40.449
 whereas for them it's still really more complicated to say 

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:44.619
 so all the chili went well laurent 

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:47.529
 in themselves too I loved the baroque I tell him I'm going to play 

00:03:47.529 --> 00:03:50.529
 in casablanca for the french community 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:54.459
 for me marrakech is a historic city 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:58.629
 pastry chef had to make it clear that one will play frozen and not ripe 

00:03:59.499 --> 00:04:02.499
 nomura did not say anything a future he said 

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:07.339
 they finally gave me a deep friendship 

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:11.219
 because that affected a lot 

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:14.329
 that I could be so moved at the idea that it fascinates me snack 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:21.039
 she told me the others are there to offer them a collection must 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:24.039
 month course 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:28.229
 you also had the idea with immense gratitude 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.680
 yes surely still among you who wonder if a sincere friendship 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.279
 men-women is authentically possible 

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:39.279
 in this story is well proof that it is possible 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.960
 step by step with me, he says 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:45.710
 but if possible
