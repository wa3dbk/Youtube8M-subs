visor connecting points because they

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.449 
visor connecting points because they
stick<00:02:50.360> out<00:02:50.480> so<00:02:50.540> far<00:02:51.110> from<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.099> rest<00:02:52.250> of<00:02:52.370> the

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459

stick out so far from the rest of the
helmet<00:02:52.819> they<00:02:52.909> don't<00:02:53.120> follow<00:02:53.360> the<00:02:53.629> lines<00:02:54.159> any

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:55.159 
helmet they don't follow the lines any

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:56.890 
helmet they don't follow the lines any
air<00:02:55.519> that<00:02:55.549> rushes<00:02:56.060> past<00:02:56.329> the<00:02:56.450> helmet<00:02:56.780> is

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
air that rushes past the helmet is

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.190

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
hitting that making noise and obviously

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.869
