back into the review so like I said this

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.090 
back into the review so like I said this
is<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.189> avi<00:01:11.729> IQ<00:01:12.540> smart<00:01:12.930> case<00:01:13.170> for<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.530> ipad<00:01:13.860> 2

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
is the avi IQ smart case for the ipad 2

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.800 
is the avi IQ smart case for the ipad 2
and<00:01:14.340> looking<00:01:15.090> at<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.270> front<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.540> it<00:01:15.630> it's

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
and looking at the front of it it's

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.810 
and looking at the front of it it's
pretty<00:01:16.080> hard<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.380> actually<00:01:16.590> see<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.040> case<00:01:17.430> but

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
pretty hard to actually see a case but

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.160 
pretty hard to actually see a case but
that's<00:01:18.000> because<00:01:18.210> it's<00:01:18.390> basically<00:01:18.840> a

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
that's because it's basically a

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.160 
that's because it's basically a
minimalistic<00:01:19.920> case<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.150> if<00:01:21.600> we<00:01:21.750> turn<00:01:21.930> it<00:01:22.049> over

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
minimalistic case and if we turn it over

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.859 
minimalistic case and if we turn it over
to<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.470> back<00:01:22.619> we<00:01:23.250> do<00:01:23.490> see<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.880> case<00:01:24.119> now<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:24.600> did

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
to the back we do see the case now I did

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.039 
to the back we do see the case now I did
get<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.200> black<00:01:25.409> color<00:01:26.299> however<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:27.479> does<00:01:27.750> also

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
get the black color however it does also

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.149

come<00:01:28.500> in<00:01:28.770> silver<00:01:29.159> black<00:01:30.000> red<00:01:30.299> pink<00:01:31.159> orange

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.969 
come in silver black red pink orange
green<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.700> blue<00:01:33.210> however<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.200> mean<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.590> just<00:01:34.650> got

green and blue however I mean I just got

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.740 
green and blue however I mean I just got
it<00:01:35.220> so<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.460> can<00:01:35.670> match<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:36.000> smart<00:01:36.299> cover<00:01:36.509> but

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
it so you can match the smart cover but

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.960 
it so you can match the smart cover but
you<00:01:36.869> can<00:01:37.079> do<00:01:37.259> whatever<00:01:37.470> you<00:01:37.770> like<00:01:37.909> now<00:01:38.909> the

you can do whatever you like now the

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.420 
you can do whatever you like now the
case<00:01:39.240> is<00:01:39.420> very<00:01:39.869> thin<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.259> only<00:01:40.439> adds<00:01:40.710> one<00:01:41.100> point

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
case is very thin it only adds one point

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.639 
case is very thin it only adds one point
five<00:01:41.640> millimeters<00:01:42.329> of<00:01:42.360> thickness<00:01:42.930> so<00:01:43.560> it

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
five millimeters of thickness so it

this<00:03:51.600> is<00:03:51.780> a<00:03:51.840> little<00:03:52.230> expensive<00:03:52.590> however<00:03:53.340> if

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
this is a little expensive however if

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.490 
this is a little expensive however if
you<00:03:53.459> put<00:03:53.820> it<00:03:53.940> in<00:03:54.030> perspective<00:03:54.239> with<00:03:54.870> any<00:03:55.230> of

you put it in perspective with any of

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.140 
you put it in perspective with any of
you<00:03:55.590> who<00:03:55.769> i<00:03:55.799> bought<00:03:56.070> a<00:03:56.100> leather<00:03:56.519> smart<00:03:56.970> cover

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
you who i bought a leather smart cover

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.849 
you who i bought a leather smart cover
it<00:03:57.359> is<00:03:57.480> actually<00:03:57.660> about<00:03:58.200> twenty<00:03:58.709> bucks

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859 
it is actually about twenty bucks

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:01.039 
it is actually about twenty bucks
cheaper<00:03:59.250> than<00:03:59.940> your<00:04:00.239> leather<00:04:00.450> smart<00:04:00.840> cover

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
cheaper than your leather smart cover

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:02.449 
cheaper than your leather smart cover
and<00:04:01.230> it<00:04:01.319> definitely<00:04:01.500> does<00:04:01.799> a<00:04:01.829> lot<00:04:02.100> more<00:04:02.310> to

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
and it definitely does a lot more to

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.240 
and it definitely does a lot more to
protect<00:04:02.640> the<00:04:03.180> iPads<00:04:03.630> backing<00:04:04.079> so<00:04:04.620> it's<00:04:04.950> you

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
protect the iPads backing so it's you

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.800 
protect the iPads backing so it's you
know<00:04:05.579> it's<00:04:05.609> a<00:04:05.760> little<00:04:06.000> expensive<00:04:06.180> but<00:04:06.480> it's

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
know it's a little expensive but it's

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.050 
know it's a little expensive but it's
not<00:04:07.049> the<00:04:07.079> worst<00:04:07.530> thing<00:04:07.709> in<00:04:07.890> the<00:04:07.980> world

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
not the worst thing in the world

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.370 
not the worst thing in the world
secondly<00:04:09.060> it<00:04:09.239> does<00:04:09.510> add<00:04:09.750> a<00:04:09.780> little<00:04:10.170> bit<00:04:10.319> of

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
secondly it does add a little bit of

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.319 
secondly it does add a little bit of
weight<00:04:10.590> to<00:04:10.769> your<00:04:10.799> iPad<00:04:11.280> and<00:04:11.549> a<00:04:11.700> little<00:04:12.150> bit<00:04:12.269> of

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
weight to your iPad and a little bit of

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:14.509 
weight to your iPad and a little bit of
bulkiness<00:04:12.989> it<00:04:13.620> takes<00:04:13.889> a<00:04:13.980> little<00:04:14.100> while<00:04:14.250> to<00:04:14.430> get

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
bulkiness it takes a little while to get

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.490 
bulkiness it takes a little while to get
used<00:04:14.819> to<00:04:15.000> because<00:04:15.209> you're<00:04:15.720> so<00:04:15.930> used<00:04:16.169> to<00:04:16.380> that

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
used to because you're so used to that

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.060 
used to because you're so used to that
thinness<00:04:16.950> of<00:04:17.340> the<00:04:17.400> iPad<00:04:18.120> just<00:04:18.539> by<00:04:19.109> itself<00:04:19.500> but

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
thinness of the iPad just by itself but

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.590 
thinness of the iPad just by itself but
it<00:04:20.220> really<00:04:20.549> doesn't<00:04:20.820> matter<00:04:21.060> because<00:04:21.269> it's

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
it really doesn't matter because it's

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.810 
it really doesn't matter because it's
still<00:04:21.870> insanely<00:04:22.380> thin<00:04:22.740> and<00:04:22.919> insanely<00:04:23.370> light

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
still insanely thin and insanely light

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.050 
still insanely thin and insanely light
so<00:04:24.599> that's<00:04:24.810> pretty<00:04:25.050> much<00:04:25.140> it<00:04:25.440> for<00:04:25.530> the<00:04:25.800> down

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
so that's pretty much it for the down

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.420 
so that's pretty much it for the down
sides<00:04:26.330> of<00:04:26.570> the<00:04:26.750> avi<00:04:27.169> IQ<00:04:27.770> smart<00:04:28.040> case<00:04:28.220> so

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
sides of the avi IQ smart case so

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.790 
sides of the avi IQ smart case so
overall<00:04:28.910> the<00:04:29.090> avi<00:04:29.510> IQ<00:04:30.020> smart<00:04:30.350> case<00:04:30.560> is

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
overall the avi IQ smart case is

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.770 
overall the avi IQ smart case is
definitely<00:04:31.400> a<00:04:31.430> must<00:04:31.850> buy<00:04:32.090> in<00:04:32.360> my<00:04:32.510> opinion

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
definitely a must buy in my opinion

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.480 
definitely a must buy in my opinion
because<00:04:33.050> it<00:04:33.290> does<00:04:33.500> work<00:04:33.770> with<00:04:33.950> Smart<00:04:34.310> Cover

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490
