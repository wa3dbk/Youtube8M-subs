00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
head over to articulation he has a ball

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.740 
head over to articulation he has a ball
jointed<00:02:57.810> head<00:02:58.050> that<00:02:58.410> can<00:02:58.890> rotate<00:02:59.450> 360<00:03:00.450> degrees

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
jointed head that can rotate 360 degrees

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.660 
jointed head that can rotate 360 degrees
and<00:03:01.730> his<00:03:02.730> arm<00:03:03.060> rotates<00:03:03.570> 360<00:03:04.140> degrees<00:03:04.410> goes<00:03:05.340> in

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
and his arm rotates 360 degrees goes in

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.310 
and his arm rotates 360 degrees goes in
and<00:03:05.850> out<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.840> shoulder<00:03:07.350> and<00:03:07.820> he<00:03:08.820> only<00:03:09.030> has

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
articulation the upper legs now it kind

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.150 
articulation the upper legs now it kind
of<00:03:14.370> sucks<00:03:14.700> because<00:03:15.180> this<00:03:16.110> guy<00:03:16.380> can't<00:03:16.800> really

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
stays on for a good duration of time and

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.460 
stays on for a good duration of time and
let's<00:04:53.550> see<00:04:53.669> it's<00:04:53.820> full<00:04:54.000> effect<00:04:54.389> with<00:04:54.810> this

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
let's see it's full effect with this

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.670 
let's see it's full effect with this
light<00:04:55.740> off<00:04:55.949> here<00:04:56.780> so<00:04:57.780> that's<00:04:57.960> it<00:04:58.139> off<00:04:58.380> right

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
light off here so that's it off right

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.529 
light off here so that's it off right
here<00:04:58.919> and<00:04:59.190> this<00:04:59.970> is<00:05:00.030> it<00:05:02.030> now<00:05:03.030> another<00:05:03.389> thing

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:03.539 
here and this is it now another thing

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:06.439 
here and this is it now another thing
that<00:05:04.250> about<00:05:05.250> this<00:05:05.430> figure<00:05:05.699> that's<00:05:05.910> really

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:06.449 
that about this figure that's really

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:10.689 
that about this figure that's really
cool<00:05:06.750> is<00:05:07.110> that<00:05:07.580> it<00:05:08.580> has<00:05:08.820> a<00:05:08.849> little<00:05:09.300> projection

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:10.699 
cool is that it has a little projection

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:17.290 
cool is that it has a little projection
so<00:05:11.900> I'll<00:05:12.900> show<00:05:13.169> you<00:05:13.229> real<00:05:13.470> fast<00:05:15.860> here<00:05:16.860> it<00:05:16.949> goes

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:17.300 
so I'll show you real fast here it goes

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:20.510 
so I'll show you real fast here it goes
as<00:05:18.300> you<00:05:18.449> see<00:05:18.630> if<00:05:18.690> there<00:05:18.930> is<00:05:19.169> a<00:05:19.500> projection<00:05:20.340> on

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
as you see if there is a projection on

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.500 
as you see if there is a projection on
the<00:05:20.669> wall<00:05:20.909> of<00:05:21.360> the<00:05:22.169> green<00:05:22.409> lantern<00:05:22.729> logo<00:05:23.729> so<00:05:24.479> I

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
the wall of the green lantern logo so I

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:33.609 
the wall of the green lantern logo so I
thought<00:05:24.750> that<00:05:24.900> was<00:05:24.990> really<00:05:25.860> cool

00:05:33.609 --> 00:05:33.619 

00:05:33.619 --> 00:05:38.269 

so<00:05:34.619> as<00:05:35.219> you<00:05:35.429> see<00:05:35.580> this<00:05:35.699> figure<00:05:36.229> has<00:05:37.229> its<00:05:37.619> pros

00:05:38.269 --> 00:05:38.279 
so as you see this figure has its pros

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:43.730 
so as you see this figure has its pros
and<00:05:38.339> cons<00:05:38.580> but<00:05:40.520> overall<00:05:41.520> I<00:05:42.059> wouldn't<00:05:42.719> give<00:05:43.589> it

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
and cons but overall I wouldn't give it

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.969 
and cons but overall I wouldn't give it
up<00:05:43.830> because<00:05:44.990> it<00:05:45.990> just<00:05:46.289> looks<00:05:46.469> great<00:05:46.740> when<00:05:46.919> I

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:46.979 
up because it just looks great when I

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:49.279 
up because it just looks great when I
display<00:05:47.399> my<00:05:47.429> I'm<00:05:47.909> not<00:05:48.179> going<00:05:48.330> to<00:05:48.419> lean<00:05:48.539> use<00:05:49.080> him

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:49.289
