00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.490
 the eagle fly is an artificial type 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.129
 emerging that wants to imitate small 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.439
 brown ephemerals that are committed to 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:21.320
 turn into an adult individual 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:23.449
 in practice he can work at the same 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.119
 level of those insects about to 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:28.369
 swarming revealing deceptive too 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.410
 for the most cunning fish they lend 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.680
 much attention to the choice of 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.870
 own prey we insert in the jaw 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.769
 of the clamp a straight shank hook of 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:41.360
 measure between 20 and 14 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:43.100
 we hold the coil loaded with 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.830
 a mounting silk spool 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.199
 brown and fix the end of the yarn on 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:51.070
 shank of the hook winding it up 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:53.449
 at the beginning of the curve with the scissors 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.150
 we eliminate the ends of the silk of 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:58.489
 assembly then we choose from a neck 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.100
 rooster of natural red color one 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:04.280
 long col and tear to one side of 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:07.070
 this a bunch of fibers we look for 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.140
 to keep well aligned fibers so 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.509
 that their tips are all in the 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.579
 same level 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:16.119
 we place on the bunch of fibers on the hook e 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:18.469
 let's stop it with some silky rounds 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:20.659
 we verify that its length is 

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:22.969
 slightly less than that of the stem 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:25.039
 and we tie it by passing the thread from 

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:27.890
 construction around the upper section 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:31.249
 of the curve forcing the fibers a 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.530
 continue slightly downwards with 

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:37.130
 the scissors decide the portion 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:39.829
 basal of the queues we take a pen 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:43.929
 of the peacock wheel and we take off one 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:43.929
 long beards next to the eye 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:52.069
 we hold the beard tightly for his 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:54.229
 apex and we pass to repeatedly in 

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:57.139
 counter-hair between a blade of the scissors and 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:00.710
 removing the fingertip of the thumb 

00:01:57.139 --> 00:02:02.749
 all the hair that covers it 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:06.469
 the beard hostel is so clean 

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:08.149
 commonly called here of peacock and is 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:10.459
 one of the best ingredients for 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.069
 make artificial bodies very much 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:17.150
 imitative characterized by a marked 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:18.950
 ring structure closer together 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.830
 the lower end of that of 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.930
 peacock 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.530
 fixing point of the pigtails e 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.000
 we tie it with the assembly line 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.460
 we continue to wrap the silk along 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.190
 little more than the back half of the stem 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:35.700
 of the hook to form a sub-body with 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.830
 conical profile we avoid to cross i 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.110
 silk passages so as not to create 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.360
 depressions or gibbosities that 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:46.590
 would prejudice the realization of 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.990
 a beautiful abdomen grab the beard of 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.620
 peacock and we wrap in the passages a lot 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:54.480
 tight around the under body the one 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.120
 peacock has a darker margin 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.420
 of the other and this allows to form 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.120
 spire with a characteristic coloring 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:06.950
 nuanced in practice very similar to that 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.950
 of abdominal rings of an ephemeral 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.490
 with a few rounds of assembly silk 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.860
 we block the peacock e 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.860
 we decide its excess portion 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:25.200
 we grease with wax da da bing a 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.390
 short section of the brown thread 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.709
 let's take a hare facial mask 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:33.090
 and we tear a few tufts of hair 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.280
 we distribute the hair on the silk 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.440
 fattened and rotate it between the 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:41.989
 fingertips of a hand for 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:44.700
 form a thin and compact cord 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:46.920
 we wrap the cord around a little 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:51.019
 more than the third quarter of the hook axis 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.019
 to create a swollen chest 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.800
 we choose three or four small feathers of 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.920
 that of gray canard 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:08.580
 natural and place one on top of another with 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:11.040
 the tips aligned smooth but towards 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:14.190
 up the fibers of the feathers to get 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.890
 a compact tuft we place at 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:20.840
 bunch of feathers on the hook and tie it up 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.840
 with silk just behind the buttonhole 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:26.930
 with the scissors we decide the part 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.930
 basal of the feathers 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:34.140
 we turn to the silk several times back 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.560
 to the hook and we realize the head of the 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.560
 Moscow 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.710
 let 's take the giver year they hook on to 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:47.360
 assembly wire and we form a series 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:50.220
 of knots on the head of the artificial 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:53.030
 serious molin and we cut the silk from 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.030
 construction 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.070
 we mean the tip of the lake of 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.170
 assembly in fly varnish e 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:06.420
 we distribute a drop of the adhesive 

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:08.180
 on the head we grab the tuft the king 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:11.130
 with the fingers of the left hand 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:13.260
 let's keep it tight and perform a 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.450
 clean cut to reduce it to one 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:18.420
 similar length or slightly longer than 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.640
 that of the stem of the hook assembly 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:23.430
 of the queen of flight has come to 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.590
 term and our little pitfall is 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.570
 ready to trick some nice trout 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:30.140
 during an ephemeral hatching 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.140
 bruni ce
