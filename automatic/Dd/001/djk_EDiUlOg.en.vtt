when<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:53.100> wing<00:01:53.310> on<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.850> side<00:01:54.090> is<00:01:54.450> hidden<00:01:54.930> in<00:01:55.110> a

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
when the wing on the side is hidden in a

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.940 
when the wing on the side is hidden in a
fold<00:01:55.409> or<00:01:55.710> is<00:01:56.070> not<00:01:56.399> complete<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:58.110> lot<00:01:58.590> of<00:01:58.710> times

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
fold or is not complete a lot of times

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.280 
fold or is not complete a lot of times
when<00:01:59.399> you<00:01:59.610> pull<00:02:00.060> your<00:02:00.240> eye<00:02:00.299> like<00:02:00.659> this<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.229> you

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
when you pull your eye like this and you

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.959 
when you pull your eye like this and you
apply<00:02:01.590> your<00:02:01.770> winged<00:02:01.979> liner<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.340> lot<00:02:02.610> of<00:02:02.729> times

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
apply your winged liner a lot of times

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.219 
apply your winged liner a lot of times
it<00:02:03.600> will<00:02:04.009> look<00:02:05.009> perfect<00:02:05.960> initially<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.170> then

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
it will look perfect initially and then

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.169 
it will look perfect initially and then
when<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:07.920> look<00:02:08.129> straight<00:02:08.160> or<00:02:08.729> when<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.030> look

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
when you look straight or when you look

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.370 
when you look straight or when you look
to<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.390> side<00:02:09.569> you'll<00:02:09.869> see<00:02:09.929> that<00:02:10.229> it's<00:02:10.410> kind<00:02:10.979> of

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
to the side you'll see that it's kind of

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.860 
to the side you'll see that it's kind of
friend<00:02:11.680> it<00:02:11.830> disappears<00:02:12.430> or<00:02:12.700> it<00:02:13.300> starts<00:02:13.540> to<00:02:13.750> get

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
friend it disappears or it starts to get

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.480 
friend it disappears or it starts to get
a<00:02:13.930> little<00:02:13.990> wonky<00:02:14.320> or<00:02:14.680> whatever<00:02:15.010> this<00:02:15.250> is<00:02:15.310> a

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
a little wonky or whatever this is a

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.460 
a little wonky or whatever this is a
winged<00:02:15.730> liner<00:02:15.910> that<00:02:16.090> I<00:02:16.270> feel<00:02:16.540> like<00:02:16.660> works<00:02:16.930> the

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
winged liner that I feel like works the

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.560 
winged liner that I feel like works the
same<00:02:17.500> every<00:02:18.100> day<00:02:18.130> and<00:02:18.550> when<00:02:19.060> I<00:02:19.090> look<00:02:19.330> at<00:02:19.450> it

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
same every day and when I look at it

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.080 
same every day and when I look at it
from<00:02:19.660> the<00:02:19.840> side<00:02:20.050> I<00:02:20.440> see<00:02:21.250> in<00:02:21.520> spite<00:02:21.850> of<00:02:21.880> the<00:02:22.060> fact

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
from the side I see in spite of the fact

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.730 
from the side I see in spite of the fact
that<00:02:22.390> I'm<00:02:22.540> older<00:02:22.780> and<00:02:22.990> that<00:02:23.230> I'm<00:02:23.380> starting<00:02:23.710> to

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
that I'm older and that I'm starting to

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.470 
that I'm older and that I'm starting to
get<00:02:23.890> a<00:02:23.950> few<00:02:24.100> little<00:02:24.220> lines<00:02:24.520> here<00:02:24.670> I<00:02:24.910> find<00:02:25.300> that

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
get a few little lines here I find that

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.540 
get a few little lines here I find that
when<00:02:25.690> I<00:02:26.110> go<00:02:26.530> to<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.770> side<00:02:26.980> i<00:02:27.010> have<00:02:27.310> a<00:02:27.340> complete

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
when I go to the side i have a complete

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.420 
when I go to the side i have a complete
wing<00:02:27.970> on<00:02:28.300> both<00:02:29.230> sides<00:02:29.530> when<00:02:29.890> your<00:02:30.070> see<00:02:30.280> me

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
wing on both sides when your see me

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.680 
wing on both sides when your see me
front<00:02:30.730> in<00:02:30.850> the<00:02:30.910> peripheral<00:02:31.300> so<00:02:31.510> I<00:02:31.540> think

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
front in the peripheral so I think

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.660 
front in the peripheral so I think
that's<00:02:31.930> important<00:02:32.410> and<00:02:32.530> hopefully<00:02:33.520> this

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
that's important and hopefully this

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.080 
that's important and hopefully this
helps<00:02:34.060> um<00:02:34.500> but<00:02:35.500> yeah<00:02:35.740> next<00:02:36.040> time<00:02:36.310> next<00:02:36.970> video

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
helps um but yeah next time next video

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.090 
helps um but yeah next time next video
will<00:02:37.450> be<00:02:37.570> eyelashes<00:02:38.200> and<00:02:38.770> then<00:02:38.860> we'll<00:02:38.980> do<00:02:39.070> a

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
will be eyelashes and then we'll do a

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.890 
will be eyelashes and then we'll do a
basic<00:02:39.370> eye<00:02:39.640> shadow<00:02:39.970> so<00:02:40.360> it's<00:02:40.510> just<00:02:40.660> going<00:02:40.840> to

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
basic eye shadow so it's just going to

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.930 
basic eye shadow so it's just going to
be<00:02:40.960> very<00:02:41.140> very<00:02:41.290> basic<00:02:41.860> very<00:02:41.890> short<00:02:42.310> videos<00:02:42.670> and

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
be very very basic very short videos and

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:51.240 
be very very basic very short videos and
hopefully<00:02:43.000> these<00:02:43.300> help<00:02:49.980> okay<00:02:50.980> so<00:02:51.040> the<00:02:51.220> first

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
hopefully these help okay so the first

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.640 
hopefully these help okay so the first
step<00:02:51.550> is<00:02:51.880> to<00:02:51.940> map<00:02:52.360> out<00:02:52.600> your<00:02:52.630> wing<00:02:53.020> and<00:02:53.260> the<00:02:53.560> way

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
step is to map out your wing and the way

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.130 
step is to map out your wing and the way
that<00:02:53.800> you<00:02:53.920> do<00:02:54.070> this<00:02:54.250> is<00:02:54.520> you<00:02:54.580> basically<00:02:55.000> draw<00:02:55.930> a

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
that you do this is you basically draw a

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.690 
that you do this is you basically draw a
line<00:02:56.350> from<00:02:56.710> the<00:02:57.430> outer<00:02:57.610> corner<00:02:57.760> of<00:02:58.120> your<00:02:58.210> eye

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
line from the outer corner of your eye

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.830 
line from the outer corner of your eye
to<00:03:00.700> where<00:03:00.850> you're<00:03:01.030> wanting<00:03:01.300> to<00:03:01.480> stop

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
to where you're wanting to stop

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.420 
to where you're wanting to stop
sometimes<00:03:02.410> you<00:03:02.530> might<00:03:02.680> want<00:03:02.890> that<00:03:02.950> wing<00:03:03.190> to<00:03:03.340> go

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
sometimes you might want that wing to go

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.160 
sometimes you might want that wing to go
out<00:03:03.580> straight<00:03:03.940> in<00:03:04.210> this<00:03:04.450> case<00:03:04.690> because<00:03:04.930> it's

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
out straight in this case because it's

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.810 
out straight in this case because it's
my<00:03:05.320> daily<00:03:05.620> winged<00:03:05.770> liner<00:03:05.950> I'm<00:03:06.220> going<00:03:06.490> straight

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
my daily winged liner I'm going straight

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.250 
my daily winged liner I'm going straight
up<00:03:06.850> I<00:03:07.150> feel<00:03:07.360> like<00:03:07.420> this<00:03:07.570> gives<00:03:07.780> my<00:03:07.900> eyes<00:03:08.050> more

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
up I feel like this gives my eyes more

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.650 
up I feel like this gives my eyes more
lift<00:03:08.470> and<00:03:08.800> then<00:03:09.490> I<00:03:09.550> go<00:03:09.760> from<00:03:09.850> the<00:03:10.000> outside<00:03:10.420> of

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
lift and then I go from the outside of

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.560 
lift and then I go from the outside of
that<00:03:10.870> line<00:03:11.140> and<00:03:11.440> I<00:03:12.130> make<00:03:12.580> a<00:03:12.610> triangle<00:03:12.970> going

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
that line and I make a triangle going

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.830 
that line and I make a triangle going
back<00:03:13.750> towards<00:03:14.320> my<00:03:14.650> eyelid<00:03:15.040> so<00:03:15.790> I<00:03:16.150> will<00:03:16.420> make

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
back towards my eyelid so I will make

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.050 
back towards my eyelid so I will make
that<00:03:17.080> triangle<00:03:17.830> however<00:03:18.250> fig<00:03:18.580> I<00:03:18.730> would<00:03:18.910> like

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
that triangle however fig I would like

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.460 
that triangle however fig I would like
it<00:03:19.210> to<00:03:19.330> be<00:03:19.450> based<00:03:19.810> on<00:03:19.990> the<00:03:20.110> ring<00:03:20.230> that<00:03:20.350> I'm

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
it to be based on the ring that I'm

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.170 
it to be based on the ring that I'm
going<00:03:20.710> for<00:03:20.920> so<00:03:21.160> in<00:03:21.280> this<00:03:21.370> case<00:03:21.580> I'm<00:03:21.820> wanting<00:03:22.060> it

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
going for so in this case I'm wanting it

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.120 
going for so in this case I'm wanting it
to<00:03:22.210> be<00:03:22.330> sort<00:03:22.570> of<00:03:22.660> settled<00:03:23.020> so<00:03:23.620> I'm<00:03:23.710> just<00:03:23.890> making

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
to be sort of settled so I'm just making

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.220 
to be sort of settled so I'm just making
a<00:03:24.190> very<00:03:24.370> small<00:03:24.640> triangle<00:03:25.210> and<00:03:25.390> keep<00:03:25.630> keeping

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
a very small triangle and keep keeping

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.640 
a very small triangle and keep keeping
that<00:03:26.350> point<00:03:26.770> of<00:03:26.980> the<00:03:27.100> wing<00:03:27.280> as<00:03:28.110> tight<00:03:29.110> and<00:03:29.410> as

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
that point of the wing as tight and as

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.800 
that point of the wing as tight and as
sharp<00:03:30.250> as<00:03:30.460> possible<00:03:30.970> so<00:03:31.120> i<00:03:31.150> usually<00:03:31.360> start

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
sharp as possible so i usually start

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.630 
sharp as possible so i usually start
filling<00:03:32.200> the<00:03:32.290> triangle<00:03:32.770> quite<00:03:33.130> a<00:03:33.160> ways<00:03:33.370> in

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
filling the triangle quite a ways in

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.090 
filling the triangle quite a ways in
from<00:03:34.030> inside<00:03:34.600> outside<00:03:35.020> of<00:03:35.170> the<00:03:35.230> one

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
from inside outside of the one

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.860 
from inside outside of the one
and<00:03:36.850> then<00:03:37.510> I'm<00:03:37.630> going<00:03:37.900> to<00:03:37.960> connect<00:03:38.410> it<00:03:39.870> by

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
and then I'm going to connect it by

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.810 
and then I'm going to connect it by
drawing<00:03:41.230> short<00:03:41.620> thin<00:03:41.980> strokes<00:03:42.310> from<00:03:42.640> the

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
drawing short thin strokes from the

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.570 
drawing short thin strokes from the
inner<00:03:43.000> corner<00:03:43.090> my<00:03:43.600> back<00:03:44.170> to<00:03:44.440> that<00:03:44.620> wing<00:03:44.830> the

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580 
inner corner my back to that wing the

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:47.580 
inner corner my back to that wing the
inner<00:03:45.820> corner<00:03:46.270> is<00:03:46.360> going<00:03:46.570> to<00:03:46.690> be<00:03:46.780> here<00:03:47.320> Finn

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
inner corner is going to be here Finn

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.160 
inner corner is going to be here Finn
and<00:03:47.920> then<00:03:48.400> it<00:03:49.180> gets<00:03:49.300> thicker<00:03:49.570> as<00:03:49.810> it<00:03:50.020> goes

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
and then it gets thicker as it goes

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:52.620 
and then it gets thicker as it goes
towards<00:03:50.530> the<00:03:50.680> way<00:03:50.800> and<00:03:51.460> then<00:03:52.210> I<00:03:52.240> just<00:03:52.420> kind<00:03:52.540> of

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
towards the way and then I just kind of

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.330 
towards the way and then I just kind of
fill<00:03:52.870> in<00:03:52.900> any<00:03:53.260> spots<00:03:53.590> that<00:03:53.710> I<00:03:53.830> feel<00:03:54.040> like<00:03:54.130> need

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
to be filled in and then the last step

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.350 
to be filled in and then the last step

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
little bit thicker you can go back from

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.720 
little bit thicker you can go back from
the<00:04:10.660> top<00:04:10.960> point<00:04:11.410> of<00:04:11.650> going<00:04:11.800> and<00:04:12.190> just<00:04:12.250> kind<00:04:12.670> of

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
the top point of going and just kind of

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.330 
the top point of going and just kind of
thick<00:04:13.720> in<00:04:13.840> that<00:04:13.960> line<00:04:14.140> a<00:04:14.170> little<00:04:14.380> bit<00:04:14.500> and<00:04:14.800> I'm

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
thick in that line a little bit and I'm

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.590 
thick in that line a little bit and I'm
just<00:04:15.610> doing<00:04:15.820> that<00:04:15.940> to<00:04:16.000> kind<00:04:16.239> of<00:04:16.300> keep<00:04:16.450> it

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
just doing that to kind of keep it

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.450 
just doing that to kind of keep it
cohesive<00:04:17.200> with<00:04:17.440> the<00:04:17.530> other<00:04:17.650> side<00:04:17.920> so<00:04:18.250> as<00:04:18.280> you

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:18.460 
cohesive with the other side so as you

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:20.250 
cohesive with the other side so as you
can<00:04:18.580> see<00:04:18.760> it's<00:04:18.970> pretty<00:04:19.300> even<00:04:19.690> on<00:04:19.780> both<00:04:19.930> sides

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
can see it's pretty even on both sides

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.560 
can see it's pretty even on both sides
and<00:04:20.560> then<00:04:20.680> makes<00:04:20.830> it<00:04:20.980> a<00:04:21.040> lot<00:04:21.220> easier<00:04:21.280> and<00:04:22.180> then

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
and then makes it a lot easier and then

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.000 
and then makes it a lot easier and then
a<00:04:22.600> very<00:04:22.900> important<00:04:23.380> step<00:04:23.440> to<00:04:23.740> your<00:04:23.770> winged
