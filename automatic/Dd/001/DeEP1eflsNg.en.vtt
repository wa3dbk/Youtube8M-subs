00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:12.420
 hi to all dear friends welcome back 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:15.420
 in includes the web 76 a video focus on 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.150
 this one plus 2 regarding the 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.619
 reception or better management of the dual 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.500
 sim on this device 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.359
 you know that my one plus two is not 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.730
 is the international version or better the 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.330
 version that is sold inside 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.700
 of the one plus circuit through invitations 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.980
 in short, through the classic procedure 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.510
 but this is a sample product that 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.260
 arrives directly from big shop 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.539
 Puntonet yesterday 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.359
 in short these days on the various sites 

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:47.609
 very important was also told that 

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:51.149
 as this device has a code 

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:54.329
 univocal imei can not be used 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.780
 the dual sim was also said that 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.789
 the 800 megahertz band is missing 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.219
 indeed it is true because on all 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.619
 devices made in china except or better 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.190
 China import except some cases 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.130
 isolated this blessed 800 band is missing 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.110
 megahertz what it means it means that 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.470
 with the wind operator and in particular in 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.080
 some cases the lte in connection is missing 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.659
 some areas of italy but in short this 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.100
 only for those who wind while me 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.520
 against Italy or the possibility 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.289
 clearly on band 1900's friends of 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.350
 go quietly in the t and t 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:34.289
 switch wings safely between 3g and 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.780
 2g clearly roaming with tim 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:40.170
 in short, we need to focus 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.700
 particular why read that this 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.170
 device does not work at all 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.080
 like dual sim 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.530
 because it has a unique imei code, it seems to me 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.119
 a little to say the untrue to you 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.819
 I show more closely 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.340
 if I can focus here is here 

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:58.739
 this is my one plus 2 with two sims 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.530
 of 3 italia in the primary that goes into 

00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:03.899
 3g connection because in my area not 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.519
 I am happy and the second clearly goes 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:09.119
 roaming because you know that 

00:02:05.519 --> 00:02:11.190
 you have to choose between which sim to navigate 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.590
 that is, or rather with which one but go in 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.480
 data connection in the menu 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.040
 of the settings clearly we can 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.739
 manage all the dual sim 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.660
 inside sim cards and you see that 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.599
 below we can choose the network 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.879
 given the default dinner the call 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.879
 that is, I always choose to ask every 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:33.239
 time so every time one plus asks me 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:35.550
 on which sim to go to make one 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.700
 test call now we go to 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.610
 call a person so let's go 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.370
 immediately inside our telephone 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.400
 and I immediately show you as one plus 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.260
 he asks me whether to call with the sim 1 or 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.750
 call us with sim 2 clearly 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.690
 we will call both our sims 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:03:00.880
 call 1 let's do the first one 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:03:03.230
 call we put in speakerphone 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:30.049
 clearly it is obscured for privacy 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:32.349
 the phone number dani pronto ok ti 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:34.910
 I'm calling for the video of the two sims 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:36.950
 blast 2 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.489
 then this is the first yes but now you 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:47.299
 I call with the second go 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:49.579
 ok already the first sim is gone now 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:53.049
 let's go call with the second one 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:53.049
 by pressing on call 2 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.140
 to 

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:14.580
 here is this is the second sim is ok right 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:14.580
 well thank you damage 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:24.580
 ok how did you hear it all works a 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.910
 wonder but clearly you see it 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:31.150
 also from dall antenne same that 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:33.550
 objectively it is clearly used yes 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.380
 they use the two sims simultaneously 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.580
 calls arriving on the first or 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.039
 on the second sim 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.470
 obviously one plus will tell you which one 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:43.840
 siemens abusing or if the primary or 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.430
 the secondary is a video focus which 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.440
 since you asked so many 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:49.900
 since I read that there were so many 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.000
 worried if buying the version of 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.250
 one plus two within channels 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.020
 alternative but were afraid of not 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.960
 be able to use the dual sim for the 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:01.840
 lack of dual sim pil 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.910
 because it has a unique imei code vi 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.340
 was absolutely to say that also for 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:08.530
 example me notes of schumi has a code 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.800
 imei unique however absolutely the dual 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.450
 sim works so guys don't 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.240
 a worry maybe better before 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:18.280
 Inquire better without alarming you one 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.020
 plus 2 works beautifully 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:23.410
 maybe if you don't want to buy it for a 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:25.000
 another reason ok but come to say that not 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:27.280
 the two work together because it has a 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.770
 unique e-mail code seems to me a bit 

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.900
 it's all out today for the pot 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:34.060
 dear to the boys we feel like we always are 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.650
 within the next videos I hope that 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.750
 this focus is also to do 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.760
 clarity in your ideas and there 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:43.260
 we feel as always inside the 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.260
 upcoming video reviews
