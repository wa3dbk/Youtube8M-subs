00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:13.270
 hello well-found girls today is Thursday 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:16.030
 I'm 651 in the morning but he liked it 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:18.970
 very much the trick I did though 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:21.670
 you will have flashed another flash e 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:26.560
 so I decided to make you a free soft 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:29.440
 i would therefore tighten the trick to this 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.160
 very bright perhaps a bit risky 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:35.829
 that very beloved day basically 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.089
 I will explain briefly what I put 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:39.249
 what he did 

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:40.870
 we are using this as a basis for 

00:00:39.249 --> 00:00:43.179
 the disheveled then I will make myself a beautiful one 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.460
 plastic ponytail I am using 

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:47.409
 this is the bb climate of meats and for 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.159
 the nista balls I will tell you about it in 

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:50.159
 specific 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:54.609
 I would also like to return for a moment 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.319
 opinion however this is for skins 

00:00:54.609 --> 00:01:00.129
 mixed as a result does not kill him 

00:00:56.319 --> 00:01:02.979
 too much as a concealer i am using this 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:06.130
 that I have already illustrated in another 

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:08.530
 video is always reolon meat and me 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:13.840
 love it so much so much so much 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:15.280
 so much massacre to fix and then 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.369
 clearly because these are products 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:21.490
 in cream I use this which is of 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:23.710
 marks the mineral ice cream finish in the 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.479
 medium glass color 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.360
 as you can see quite clearly actually 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:35.200
 do not be misled by the name and color 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:37.210
 this with regard to the cheeks has 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.299
 used a blush that if I find you there 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:45.490
 I'll show you this is it here 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:49.480
 it's called desert rose by max bello molto 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:52.690
 very hot a lot you see 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:56.290
 is present is a color that is seen that 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:02:00.580
 warm in the complexion in my opinion healthy 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:05.920
 then on the lips then my eyes leave 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:08.080
 the more the latter has used this than 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.560
 I bought it for a couple of days 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:15.790
 fa is from the china dolls collection the 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:23.020
 number 303 and this color slightly 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:26.350
 has launched from afar perhaps better 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:31.240
 slightly cast a non color 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:32.080
 properly young rewards a sport a 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.360
 color that can be used 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.520
 quietly from day that I have it 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.860
 combined with their own mantic that was 0 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.210
 2 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.100
 all pupa products you see have them 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.720
 buy with half themes and enter everyone 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.760
 products you see in this video there 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.390
 I bought with money but me this one 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.680
 my husband 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:52.660
 no kidding with our pennies 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.580
 eyes the eyes that are the part then 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.940
 in my opinion more interesting than this 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:00.850
 make up I used as a base 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:06.220
 this time the shadow insurance day to 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:08.320
 face and I put it all eyelid then 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:11.290
 on the eyelid I put this 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.600
 beautiful color 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.330
 then I have already expressed myself on these su 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.030
 these products are good products 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:21.520
 that are not worth the price they cost 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:26.620
 by now there goes then I use this 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:30.070
 is chanel's eva kant is part of 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:35.710
 illusion line with shadows and this color 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:41.530
 so is a gray gun 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:45.010
 with the green of the photo 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:47.170
 make you see better and the other much 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.510
 pleasant as color and very much 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.030
 bright definitely been a little light 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.780
 farther you see so much knit 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:58.720
 very bright that opens the eye well 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:01.300
 on the eyelid or on the joint of the 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:06.460
 allowed eyelid a very dark color 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:08.170
 I'm making a killing of mark and I have to 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.510
 just find the right stick from the 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:13.330
 what price 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:16.090
 here it is, this is the color here 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.340
 we are at a good is crazy actually is 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:22.570
 a gray with blue reflections and yes 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:25.000
 calls contrast in reality then how 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:29.140
 see once all this is applied 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.050
 grand bleu goes faded stage a 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:35.880
 highlighter so I applied the 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:39.070
 letters under the south than on the bar 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:43.570
 on the browbone and I put 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:45.850
 that's what nylon always max and then 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:49.240
 I went well to blend it with 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:52.990
 the contrast in while I applied in the 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:55.300
 while no later I applied the pencil or 

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:58.420
 used this which is of pupo was 09 la 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.580
 multi play and apply a point pencil 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:03.610
 below in the lower line 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:06.430
 very often without blending it too much and then 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:11.110
 also well attached to tourism in 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:14.110

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:16.120
 really so much so much so 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:19.200
 on the eyebrows has nothing because 

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:23.050
 by day it would have been an exaggeration 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:25.780
 also put a pencil avalanche 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.760
 already a pretty important trick for 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.460
 so what about the eyes so I am 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.669
