00:04:57.959 --> 00:04:57.969 
burner and I'm going to turn this burner

00:04:57.969 --> 00:05:01.760 
burner and I'm going to turn this burner
on<00:04:58.300> high<00:04:58.330> to<00:04:59.050> begin<00:04:59.199> with<00:04:59.729> to<00:05:00.729> get<00:05:01.479> them

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
on high to begin with to get them

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.700 
on high to begin with to get them
started<00:05:02.770> boiling<00:05:03.129> faster<00:05:04.090> once<00:05:04.960> they<00:05:05.349> start

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
started boiling faster once they start

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.499 
started boiling faster once they start
boiling<00:05:05.949> I'm<00:05:06.279> going<00:05:06.430> to<00:05:06.490> cut<00:05:06.729> it<00:05:06.849> down<00:05:06.999> to<00:05:07.270> low

00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:07.509 
boiling I'm going to cut it down to low

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:10.140 
boiling I'm going to cut it down to low
so<00:05:07.900> they're<00:05:08.050> just<00:05:08.199> barely<00:05:08.590> boiling<00:05:09.310> now

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
so they're just barely boiling now

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.290 
so they're just barely boiling now
here's<00:05:10.449> one<00:05:10.689> of<00:05:10.719> the<00:05:10.900> secrets<00:05:11.560> to<00:05:12.000> help<00:05:13.000> your

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
here's one of the secrets to help your

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:18.480 
here's one of the secrets to help your
beans<00:05:13.659> have<00:05:14.169> a<00:05:14.199> more<00:05:14.650> tender<00:05:17.340> peeling<00:05:18.340> or

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
beans have a more tender peeling or

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.119 
beans have a more tender peeling or
shell<00:05:18.819> on<00:05:19.240> them<00:05:19.539> because<00:05:20.110> these<00:05:20.710> kind<00:05:21.009> of

00:05:21.119 --> 00:05:21.129 
shell on them because these kind of

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:24.719 
shell on them because these kind of
large<00:05:21.969> lima<00:05:22.360> beans<00:05:23.129> tend<00:05:24.129> to<00:05:24.219> have<00:05:24.340> a<00:05:24.370> really

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:24.729 
large lima beans tend to have a really

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:28.760 
large lima beans tend to have a really
tough<00:05:25.029> shell<00:05:25.419> on<00:05:25.719> them<00:05:25.949> so<00:05:26.949> I'm<00:05:27.069> going<00:05:27.250> to<00:05:27.339> take

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:28.770 
tough shell on them so I'm going to take

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:33.529 
tough shell on them so I'm going to take
about<00:05:29.770> a<00:05:29.830> half<00:05:30.279> a<00:05:30.490> teaspoon<00:05:31.259> of<00:05:32.259> baking<00:05:32.740> soda

00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:33.539 
about a half a teaspoon of baking soda

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:37.559 
about a half a teaspoon of baking soda
now<00:05:34.539> you<00:05:35.199> don't<00:05:35.560> want<00:05:36.009> to<00:05:36.189> salt<00:05:36.999> your<00:05:37.300> beans

00:05:37.559 --> 00:05:37.569 
now you don't want to salt your beans

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:42.240 
now you don't want to salt your beans
until<00:05:38.169> they're<00:05:38.319> completely<00:05:38.909> done<00:05:39.909> and<00:05:41.250> what

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250 
until they're completely done and what

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:45.499 
until they're completely done and what
what<00:05:42.550> the<00:05:42.699> baking<00:05:43.120> soda<00:05:43.389> is<00:05:43.599> going<00:05:43.659> to<00:05:43.810> do<00:05:44.020> is

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:45.509 
what the baking soda is going to do is

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:48.540 
what the baking soda is going to do is
cause<00:05:46.509> a<00:05:46.539> change<00:05:47.169> in<00:05:47.439> the<00:05:47.500> water<00:05:47.919> it's<00:05:48.400> going

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
cause a change in the water it's going

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.850

call biscuit bread with this meal we've
got<00:06:27.870> the<00:06:28.870> beans<00:06:29.399> some<00:06:30.399> of<00:06:30.520> the<00:06:30.610> kale<00:06:30.909> that<00:06:31.449> I

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:31.990 
got the beans some of the kale that I

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.709 
got the beans some of the kale that I
fixed<00:06:32.740> a<00:06:33.039> couple<00:06:33.189> of<00:06:33.370> weeks<00:06:33.580> ago<00:06:33.789> and<00:06:34.300> some<00:06:34.599> of

00:06:34.709 --> 00:06:34.719 
fixed a couple of weeks ago and some of

00:06:34.719 --> 00:06:37.800 
fixed a couple of weeks ago and some of
the<00:06:34.779> beets<00:06:35.080> I<00:06:35.469> got<00:06:35.680> those<00:06:35.860> in<00:06:36.099> January<00:06:36.819> and<00:06:37.089> of

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:37.810 
the beets I got those in January and of

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:40.679 
the beets I got those in January and of
course<00:06:38.110> iced<00:06:38.379> tea<00:06:38.889> so<00:06:39.849> there's<00:06:40.149> a<00:06:40.240> good<00:06:40.509> look

00:06:40.679 --> 00:06:40.689 
course iced tea so there's a good look

00:06:40.689 --> 00:06:41.129 
course iced tea so there's a good look
at<00:06:40.839> the

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:41.139 
at the

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:44.950 
at the
now<00:06:42.139> the<00:06:42.710> beans<00:06:42.980> have<00:06:43.460> I<00:06:43.820> believe<00:06:44.060> about<00:06:44.660> eight

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:44.960 
now the beans have I believe about eight

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:49.120 
now the beans have I believe about eight
grams<00:06:45.350> of<00:06:45.620> protein<00:06:46.160> in<00:06:46.660> 1/4<00:06:47.660> of<00:06:47.900> a<00:06:47.990> cup<00:06:48.130> dried

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:49.130 
grams of protein in 1/4 of a cup dried

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:55.360 
grams of protein in 1/4 of a cup dried
so<00:06:50.320> this<00:06:51.320> is<00:06:51.500> for<00:06:51.770> sure<00:06:52.780> these<00:06:53.780> little<00:06:54.740> Bulls<00:06:55.130> I

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:55.370 
so this is for sure these little Bulls I

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:57.700 
so this is for sure these little Bulls I
think<00:06:55.580> hold<00:06:55.790> 2<00:06:56.000> cups<00:06:56.330> so<00:06:56.780> this<00:06:56.990> is<00:06:57.169> plenty<00:06:57.590> of

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:57.710 
think hold 2 cups so this is plenty of

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.190 
think hold 2 cups so this is plenty of
protein<00:06:58.190> you<00:06:58.310> don't<00:06:58.490> need<00:06:58.669> any<00:06:58.940> meat<00:06:59.270> and<00:06:59.510> the

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:00.200 
protein you don't need any meat and the

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.440 
protein you don't need any meat and the
only<00:07:00.350> thing<00:07:00.590> I<00:07:00.680> use<00:07:00.710> to<00:07:01.130> season<00:07:01.610> them<00:07:01.730> was<00:07:02.000> salt

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:02.450 
only thing I use to season them was salt

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:06.280 
only thing I use to season them was salt
and<00:07:02.780> a<00:07:02.900> little<00:07:03.139> bit<00:07:03.290> of<00:07:03.430> canola<00:07:04.430> oil<00:07:05.020> same<00:07:06.020> with

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:06.290 
and a little bit of canola oil same with

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:08.530 
and a little bit of canola oil same with
the<00:07:06.440> kale<00:07:06.680> a<00:07:06.710> little<00:07:07.280> bit<00:07:07.430> of<00:07:07.550> salt<00:07:07.850> and<00:07:08.180> a

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:08.540 
the kale a little bit of salt and a

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:11.260 
the kale a little bit of salt and a
little<00:07:08.600> bit<00:07:09.050> of<00:07:09.169> canola<00:07:09.470> and<00:07:09.919> they<00:07:10.700> go<00:07:10.880> really

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:11.270 
little bit of canola and they go really

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:13.990 
little bit of canola and they go really
well<00:07:11.600> with<00:07:11.960> this<00:07:12.560> biscuit<00:07:12.889> toast<00:07:13.430> and<00:07:13.729> that<00:07:13.850> in

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:15.710 
the thing in the world that just made up

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:19.060
