00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:07.410
 out of the oven and then went 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.780
 but rather to honor here just for you game 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.460
 Look how beautiful it is now, I'm going 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:16.230
 cut and let's see how it 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:19.080
 What is the taste of the mince pie? 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.000
 I cut two of the smaller ones that are 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.050
 made stuffed 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:30.810
 here I have seen Emilio and Olive and here 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:34.230
 has a chopped carrot has a spoon 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.200
 oil and a whole onion 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.760
 You'll like it in my case too. 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.190
 to be part of the filling 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:52.289
 I put a generous of seasoning 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:59.489
 complete I do here in well 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:01:02.010
 the very water that you 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.910
 I wish it were you put 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.420
 tomato 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.900
 I advise not to put it in the fire 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:13.020
 automatically from parents very quickly 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:15.720
 for mass I put 200 ml of water 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:22.830
 two tablespoons of milk powder 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:25.770
 skimmed but may be up to medium water 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.920
 cup of brown rice bran and a 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.100
 full cup oat bran one 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:36.270
 tablespoon of corn starch filled 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:39.810
 50 ml of good quality oil and one 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:46.729
 tablespoon of yeast and the mass it 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:50.820
 O is so I here are the stews 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:56.659
 and here's what I put in the fire 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.659
 now I just mix and lift pass 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.369
 a hole shape with two tablespoons of 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.939
 normal wheat flour 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:08.789
 two tablespoons of oat bran and two 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:12.319
 spoonfuls of grated cheese and brushed the 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:14.540
 egg with the same brush on the background 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:17.379
 I think you can see that the 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.629
 cheese that you have not stored in the 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:23.269
 drawer but I left it is 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:26.540
 So, why does the time come? 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:28.489
 which bakes it looks more like that 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.450
 Donor the line that gets hotter 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.450
 more beautiful 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:37.120
 it contains more stuffing than dough but 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.019
 she gets very little just for 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.090
 even develop 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:44.060
 now I'll take in the preheated oven 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:48.439
 heated for ten minutes and 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:51.620
 Oven I'll show you in my oven. 

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:53.510
 It took 45 minutes 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.540
 Look at you guys, see inside. 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:00.349
 alone and on the outside also then that 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:03.199
 and flour mixed with the 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:06.019
 cheese and vein is what gives a quality 

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:11.599
 for white writing on top but not 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:18.560
 not browned then you meet the oven 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:20.840
 of you there the amount of salt remained 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.229
 You saw that I did not put the 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.229
 hands-on
