00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
battery up a little bit more for me I'm

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.999 
battery up a little bit more for me I'm
not<00:01:51.030> going<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.329> use<00:01:51.509> them<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:52.350> you<00:01:52.560> have<00:01:52.740> a

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
not going to use them and you have a

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.370 
not going to use them and you have a
manual<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:53.820> foresight<00:01:54.270> manual<00:01:54.720> that<00:01:55.290> it

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
manual the foresight manual that it

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.020 
manual the foresight manual that it
comes<00:01:55.590> with<00:01:55.850> okay

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
comes with okay

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
so let's take a look at the plane here

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.410 
so let's take a look at the plane here
and<00:02:00.810> I've<00:02:00.930> got<00:02:01.079> it<00:02:01.110> packaged<00:02:01.590> very<00:02:01.890> well<00:02:02.420> let's

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
and I've got it packaged very well let's

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.240 
and I've got it packaged very well let's
pull<00:02:03.659> it<00:02:03.750> out<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:03.960> box<00:02:05.299> alright

capable<00:02:24.260> and<00:02:25.390> the<00:02:26.390> thing<00:02:26.600> I<00:02:26.720> like<00:02:26.900> about<00:02:26.930> these

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
capable and the thing I like about these

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.400 
capable and the thing I like about these
planes<00:02:27.820> from<00:02:28.820> a<00:02:29.090> flight<00:02:29.330> and<00:02:29.540> park<00:02:29.750> zone<00:02:29.990> this

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
planes from a flight and park zone this

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.370 
planes from a flight and park zone this
is<00:02:30.650> a<00:02:30.680> binding<00:02:31.160> fly<00:02:31.430> model<00:02:31.880> you<00:02:32.840> can<00:02:33.020> bind<00:02:33.260> it

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
is a binding fly model you can bind it

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:37.660 
is a binding fly model you can bind it
to<00:02:33.560> any<00:02:33.800> dsm2<00:02:34.790> transmitter<00:02:35.680> now<00:02:36.680> with<00:02:37.340> that<00:02:37.550> in

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
to any dsm2 transmitter now with that in

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
to any dsm2 transmitter now with that in
mind<00:02:37.880> you<00:02:38.630> can<00:02:38.840> use<00:02:39.080> the<00:02:39.230> the<00:02:39.260> dx6i<00:02:40.070> or<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.180> dx7

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
mind you can use the the dx6i or the dx7

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.300 
mind you can use the the dx6i or the dx7
with<00:02:41.959> this<00:02:42.170> and<00:02:42.410> there's<00:02:42.530> a<00:02:42.620> couple<00:02:42.890> of<00:02:42.980> junior

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
with this and there's a couple of junior

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.190 
with this and there's a couple of junior
radios<00:02:43.730> that<00:02:43.760> you<00:02:44.060> can<00:02:44.180> use<00:02:44.330> with<00:02:44.510> this<00:02:44.690> as

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
radios that you can use with this as

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.560 
radios that you can use with this as
long<00:02:45.500> as<00:02:45.650> this<00:02:45.770> dsm2<00:02:46.370> compliant<00:02:47.150> you<00:02:47.209> can<00:02:47.420> use

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
long as this dsm2 compliant you can use

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.170 
long as this dsm2 compliant you can use
it<00:02:47.720> with<00:02:47.810> this<00:02:47.930> plane<00:02:48.400> and<00:02:49.400> that's<00:02:49.580> the<00:02:49.850> that's

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
it with this plane and that's the that's

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.970 
it with this plane and that's the that's
one<00:02:50.360> of<00:02:50.450> the<00:02:50.510> key<00:02:50.870> features<00:02:51.290> i<00:02:51.410> like<00:02:51.650> with<00:02:51.830> this

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
one of the key features i like with this

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.670 
one of the key features i like with this
plane<00:02:52.280> all<00:02:52.820> i<00:02:52.880> have<00:02:53.270> to<00:02:53.300> do<00:02:53.570> now<00:02:53.600> is<00:02:54.080> get<00:02:54.470> my

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
plane all i have to do now is get my

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.130 
plane all i have to do now is get my
transmitter<00:02:55.490> plug<00:02:56.420> a<00:02:56.450> battery<00:02:56.840> into<00:02:56.990> this

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
transmitter plug a battery into this

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.610

thing<00:02:57.380> bind<00:02:58.100> it<00:02:58.630> to<00:02:59.630> the<00:02:59.750> transmitter<00:03:00.290> and

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
thing bind it to the transmitter and

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.770 
thing bind it to the transmitter and
with<00:03:01.520> a<00:03:01.550> little<00:03:01.850> bit<00:03:01.970> of<00:03:02.090> programming<00:03:02.300> we're

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
with a little bit of programming we're

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.760 
with a little bit of programming we're
ready<00:03:03.020> to<00:03:03.200> go<00:03:03.350> so<00:03:04.209> with<00:03:05.209> that<00:03:05.390> in<00:03:05.630> mind<00:03:05.900> let's

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
ready to go so with that in mind let's

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.650 
ready to go so with that in mind let's
take<00:03:06.980> this<00:03:07.160> bad<00:03:07.430> boy<00:03:07.459> out<00:03:08.060> to<00:03:08.240> the<00:03:08.360> flying

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
take this bad boy out to the flying

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:34.430 
take this bad boy out to the flying
field<00:03:09.010> and<00:03:10.010> see<00:03:10.220> what<00:03:10.370> we<00:03:10.459> can<00:03:10.640> do<00:03:10.730> with
