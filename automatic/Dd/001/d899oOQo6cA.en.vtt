00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:07.069
 hello guys and girls today I bring you 5 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:11.420
 simple steps by twix to convert 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:12.740
 our air 6 the 17th hole 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:17.150
 the first thing all you need is 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:22.270
 have them since given to have syria and 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.270
 Once this is done, let's start 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:34.680
 The first thing we see is the issue 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.970
 I have since called 275 no 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.610
 you will find everything also in the 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.590
 description in case you have any questions and 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.400
 as you see 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:47.610
 the icons are similar if not equal to 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:50.650
 those of the air and 7 we can see that up 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.910
 the interface is the same of it 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.910
 the colors and everything 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.350
 it resembles a lot and the truth 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:04.300
 We can see through all folders 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:07.750
 same and it's pretty cool 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:11.790
 in second place we find ourselves with 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:14.160
 camps switcher and what it lets us do 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.550
 multitasking does not let them see this 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:20.340
 so cool way and like 17 and 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:23.520
 as you can see by sliding up 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:27.330
 we're not going to take away, it 's very cool 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:31.430
 true and it's the same as there's 7's and its 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.430
 name I repeat is car switcher 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:38.290
 in third place we have display candy 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:40.590
 that lets us make this tweet as 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.590
 you see 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:47.120
 that's how I can write what's 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.060
 a movement that makes the application 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.460
 to open again as you zoom to the 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.900
 close and when opening that is also one 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.140
 which is included and now the experience 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:59.920
 therefore we have tried again here 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.939
 character you see another reason 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:06.340
 and again, the truth is very cool 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:09.160
 and in fourth place we have 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.980
 swain bank that does not let you apply 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.830
 of this tweet because if we are not going to generate 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.230
 for example to information as there is 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:18.970
 or seven if we slide from the screen 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.450
 from there from the center more or less 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:27.000
 we will go back 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.000
 there you see it without having to 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:33.030
 press the settings button up there 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:36.920
 then another let's try it there 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.920
 beige with what pimp 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:43.260
 and well the last place is 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.760
 love parade pro that I am going to 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.799
 Redirect to a video that I already made 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.769
 about this tweet so you can see it more 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:53.310
 background and that is simply center of 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:55.650
 style notifications there are 17 in your 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.689

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.060
