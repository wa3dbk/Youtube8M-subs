100 so can't do that much damage unless

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.059 
100 so can't do that much damage unless
they're<00:03:07.720> going<00:03:07.840> to<00:03:07.900> be<00:03:07.989> tributing<00:03:08.830> it<00:03:08.920> for

they're going to be tributing it for
something<00:03:09.310> else<00:03:09.580> but<00:03:10.140> then<00:03:11.140> that<00:03:11.470> card<00:03:11.890> will

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:12.069
