00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.059
 hello news news news have gone to 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:13.019
 this morning at kiko to see the new one 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:14.610
 dark heroine collection 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.180
 so these are pretty colors 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.640
 dark for what concerns the pallets 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:26.939
 and they go from the neutral colors of brown 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:30.210
 of hazelnut with dark blue plum and yes 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.399
 can use both wet and that 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.530
 dry I would recommend the wet 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:40.860
 because it gets more intense color 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:43.559
 honestly and are the colors that I am a 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.940
 mixed in the pallets and in 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.710
 bright version is in the matt version 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:54.030
 they are beautiful pallets I must say 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:57.149
 enough writers certainly cost 16 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:01.020
 euros are not cheap and then they are gods 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.420
 but beautiful colors we are in 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.430
 summer still so I find some 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.130
 premature to buy a palette like this 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.000
 now you see, in short, I don't have them 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.460
 I am taken 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.260
 I took some products, though 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.049
 me are those somewhat peculiar of 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.759
 this line is all taken 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:25.110
 this is called dublin highlighter 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:26.670
 and we have on so seen and is a 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.060
 illuminating 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:33.270
 ok it's an illuminant for the face below 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:39.150
 stick shape with the tip that you make 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:43.590
 come out this way and I took that 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.990
 let's say a little bit warmer this is the 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.259
 peach color pitch 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.689
 there is also the gold type but don't do it 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.130
 deceive by the word gold because white 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.600
 I don't know why we have ice 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:03.689
 called so they think of white anyway 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:07.849
 this then comes 696 euros the hand then 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:11.310
 I took two pencils for the eyes 

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:14.880
 then made so 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:18.720
 they are eye shadow pencils then 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:26.630
 let's start from this they are called smokey 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:33.239
 look eyeshadow this is the number 06 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:35.599
 ok automatic tip is a very dark blue 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:38.099
 this is very dark below 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:43.100
 on the other side of the pencil there is also 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:45.569
 a gradient fade the color obviously 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.750
 they are very soft so be careful 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:51.420
 put a primer before they start 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:03:00.420
 wander around the other eyelid 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:03:03.140
 pencil and 0 7 is a lighter blue and is 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.760
 this I liked very much they saw 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.650
 this the first one I noticed then I have 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:12.180
 also seen this obscure said well yes 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:15.140
 can also use this there is 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:20.400
 Smudge and I seem to be two products I 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:24.440
 these are also interesting fast 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:28.350
 come the smoky eye shadow pencil 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:31.560
 we see a moment therefore the smoky 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:35.970
 the eye shadow is 690 instead of the illuminant 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.109
 serious are 790 with then as the last thing 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.350
 of this line 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:45.590
 I took lipstick there is a line of 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.590
 lipsticks have told me that it is very creamy 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:56.880
 here it is, let's find a point 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:04:08.030
 where to put it is a natural rose 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:08.030
 ok let's see here that I do n't know here is here 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:16.790
 pretty pink natural pink rose but 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:19.820
 not too great as you can see great 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:22.670
 really good creamy soft m'han 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:25.370
 having said that after a while the part goes away 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:29.690
 let's say a little more lucid and stay instead 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:32.840
 the color that the one that persists the most 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:34.730
 during the hours, however, it does not dry 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:38.320
 lips very useful thing 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:45.130
 this is the number 06 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:51.080
 this therefore the lipstick comes 750 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:53.540
 a certain red brick also exists 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.910
 number of colors then the line is 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:05:00.290
 completed also by two more lands 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:03.110
 clear dark and stick like 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:07.310
 this one practically in the form of 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:09.740
 blush this is how much for the new line 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:12.080
 then bought again because there is not 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:15.170
 he still had a line polish 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:19.910
 sugar because they come then among other things a 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:20.710
 euro and fifty is quite a nice kind of 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:25.250
 heavenly 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:29.330
 I really liked this thing it knows that 

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:31.160
 they put it here on the nail 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:35.900
 even if underneath there is purple but so much so 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:38.300
 I have to change we see ok nice kind of 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:41.300
 light blue and then to that sanded effect 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:43.370
 that I wanted to try to see all the 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.530
 kiko enamels are excellent I have to say the 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:48.920
 truth last a very long time then they cost 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:52.370
 very little and the girls told you 

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:56.030
 everything seems to have been 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:59.410
 exhaustive and has a basin and I'll see you 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:59.410
 the next bye bye
