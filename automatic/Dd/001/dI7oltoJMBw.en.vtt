the<00:01:40.189> passive<00:01:40.700> tank<00:01:41.439> now<00:01:42.439> here's<00:01:42.649> a<00:01:42.710> top<00:01:42.979> tip

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
the passive tank now here's a top tip

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:44.950 
the passive tank now here's a top tip
what<00:01:43.820> we're<00:01:43.939> going<00:01:44.090> to<00:01:44.180> do<00:01:44.299> we're<00:01:44.719> going<00:01:44.750> to

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
what we're going to do we're going to

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.819 
what we're going to do we're going to
cut<00:01:45.229> the<00:01:45.469> bottom<00:01:45.649> off<00:01:46.040> of<00:01:46.850> this<00:01:47.060> and<00:01:47.530> use<00:01:48.530> it<00:01:48.680> as

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
cut the bottom off of this and use it as

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:51.789 
cut the bottom off of this and use it as
a<00:01:48.860> funnel<00:01:49.630> because<00:01:50.630> the<00:01:50.869> other<00:01:51.020> tank<00:01:51.350> requires

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
a funnel because the other tank requires

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:54.910 
a funnel because the other tank requires
the<00:01:52.070> same<00:01:52.460> sort<00:01:52.789> of<00:01:52.880> fancy<00:01:53.299> screw<00:01:53.689> on<00:01:53.899> lid<00:01:54.200> and

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
the same sort of fancy screw on lid and

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.539 
the same sort of fancy screw on lid and
it<00:01:55.759> makes<00:01:56.030> this<00:01:56.600> a<00:01:56.659> much<00:01:56.990> cleaner<00:01:57.380> process<00:01:58.009> so

00:01:58.539 --> 00:01:58.549 
it makes this a much cleaner process so

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:00.160 
it makes this a much cleaner process so
we'll<00:01:58.789> just<00:01:58.969> make<00:01:59.180> this<00:01:59.360> into<00:01:59.659> a<00:01:59.689> big<00:01:59.930> funnel

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
we'll just make this into a big funnel

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.010 
we'll just make this into a big funnel
we'll<00:02:00.890> screw<00:02:01.189> it<00:02:01.310> into<00:02:01.460> place<00:02:01.759> and<00:02:02.030> we'll<00:02:02.780> fill

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
we'll screw it into place and we'll fill

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.260 
we'll screw it into place and we'll fill
it<00:02:03.140> up<00:02:03.259> and<00:02:03.500> push<00:02:04.009> down<00:02:04.219> just<00:02:04.549> like<00:02:04.700> normal<00:02:05.030> and

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
it up and push down just like normal and

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.849 
it up and push down just like normal and
we'll<00:02:05.930> fill<00:02:06.170> that<00:02:06.259> other<00:02:06.409> tank<00:02:06.710> without

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:06.859 
we'll fill that other tank without

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:09.520 
we'll fill that other tank without
making<00:02:07.310> a<00:02:07.369> big<00:02:07.399> mess<00:02:08.079> alright<00:02:09.079> so<00:02:09.229> we've<00:02:09.350> cut

making a big mess alright so we've cut

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.319 
making a big mess alright so we've cut
the<00:02:09.619> end<00:02:09.769> off<00:02:09.920> and<00:02:10.280> you'll<00:02:10.820> see<00:02:10.970> inside

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:11.329

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:16.579 
vent tube and it goes down to the bottom

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:18.280 
vent tube and it goes down to the bottom
so<00:02:16.940> what<00:02:17.060> we've<00:02:17.150> done<00:02:17.359> we've<00:02:17.780> added<00:02:18.049> a<00:02:18.200> little

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
hose to it and we drill a hole on the

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.199 
hose to it and we drill a hole on the
side<00:02:20.690> to<00:02:21.109> loop<00:02:21.260> it<00:02:21.410> back<00:02:21.440> in<00:02:21.859> because<00:02:22.820> as<00:02:23.000> you

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:37.870 
my face so we just put this little tube
on<00:02:37.010> there<00:02:37.280> we

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
on there we

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.000 
on there we
background<00:02:38.450> and<00:02:38.690> anything<00:02:39.200> that<00:02:39.230> burps<00:02:39.560> just

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
background and anything that burps just

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.040 
background and anything that burps just
goes<00:02:40.190> right<00:02:40.700> back<00:02:40.910> in<00:02:41.180> so<00:02:41.720> what<00:02:41.870> we're<00:02:41.960> going

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
goes right back in so what we're going

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.680 
goes right back in so what we're going
to<00:02:42.170> we're<00:02:42.290> going<00:02:42.320> to<00:02:42.470> top<00:02:42.680> off<00:02:42.920> the<00:02:43.790> active

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
to we're going to top off the active

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.330 
to we're going to top off the active
tank<00:02:44.960> up<00:02:45.110> here<00:02:45.140> and<00:02:45.470> then<00:02:46.010> we're<00:02:46.160> going<00:02:46.250> to

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
tank up here and then we're going to

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:48.520 
tank up here and then we're going to
move<00:02:46.550> over<00:02:46.760> to<00:02:46.910> the<00:02:47.090> passive<00:02:47.480> tank<00:02:47.720> we've<00:02:48.320> now

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
move over to the passive tank we've now

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.040 
move over to the passive tank we've now
taken<00:02:48.590> off<00:02:49.130> that<00:02:49.370> little<00:02:49.790> intake<00:02:50.210> tube<00:02:50.450> so<00:02:50.960> you

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
taken off that little intake tube so you

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.630 
taken off that little intake tube so you
can<00:02:51.230> see<00:02:51.560> the<00:02:52.040> fill<00:02:52.760> position<00:02:53.690> is<00:02:53.930> right<00:02:54.260> there

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
can see the fill position is right there

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.290 
can see the fill position is right there
so<00:02:55.640> as<00:02:55.760> you<00:02:55.880> can<00:02:56.000> see<00:02:56.060> this<00:02:56.690> kit<00:02:56.900> has<00:02:56.990> a<00:02:57.050> nice

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
so as you can see this kit has a nice

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.970 
so as you can see this kit has a nice
flexible<00:02:59.300> hose<00:03:00.190> to<00:03:01.190> make<00:03:01.400> it<00:03:01.550> much<00:03:01.760> easier<00:03:02.090> to

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
flexible hose to make it much easier to

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.330 
flexible hose to make it much easier to
fill<00:03:03.980> this<00:03:04.400> little<00:03:04.580> funnel<00:03:05.500> so<00:03:06.500> when<00:03:07.250> you

fill this little funnel so when you

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.550 
fill this little funnel so when you
order<00:03:07.490> this<00:03:07.730> from<00:03:07.970> us<00:03:08.090> you'll<00:03:08.720> get<00:03:08.900> this<00:03:09.020> nice

little hose that'll make your life a lot

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.690 
little hose that'll make your life a lot
easier<00:03:11.840> as<00:03:12.020> well<00:03:12.410> here<00:03:13.280> you<00:03:13.340> can<00:03:13.460> see<00:03:13.610> what

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
easier as well here you can see what

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.300 
easier as well here you can see what
happens<00:03:13.970> when<00:03:14.030> I<00:03:14.150> push<00:03:14.360> down<00:03:17.530> it<00:03:18.530> goes<00:03:18.740> ACS

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
happens when I push down it goes ACS

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.520 
happens when I push down it goes ACS
works<00:03:19.670> like<00:03:19.970> that<00:03:20.180> so<00:03:20.870> if<00:03:20.930> you<00:03:20.990> don't<00:03:21.170> put<00:03:21.230> that

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
works like that so if you don't put that

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.800 
works like that so if you don't put that
little<00:03:21.740> piece<00:03:22.370> on<00:03:22.610> there<00:03:22.910> you<00:03:23.480> could<00:03:23.630> end<00:03:23.750> up

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
little piece on there you could end up

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.020 
little piece on there you could end up
with<00:03:23.870> that<00:03:24.110> near<00:03:24.440> face<00:03:24.800> and<00:03:25.930> not<00:03:26.930> recommended

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
with that near face and not recommended

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.400 
with that near face and not recommended
okay<00:03:29.030> so<00:03:29.090> the<00:03:29.540> active<00:03:30.290> tank<00:03:30.530> is<00:03:30.740> now<00:03:30.950> filled

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
okay so the active tank is now filled

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.050 
okay so the active tank is now filled
you'll<00:03:33.410> know<00:03:33.590> this<00:03:33.800> it'll<00:03:34.100> it'll<00:03:34.430> stop<00:03:34.700> itself

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
you'll know this it'll it'll stop itself

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.350 
you'll know this it'll it'll stop itself
once<00:03:35.870> you<00:03:35.990> fill<00:03:36.260> it<00:03:36.380> and<00:03:36.530> won't<00:03:36.710> go<00:03:36.860> the<00:03:37.580> volume

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360 
once you fill it and won't go the volume

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.600 
once you fill it and won't go the volume
in<00:03:38.570> here<00:03:38.990> won't<00:03:39.140> decrease<00:03:39.890> anymore<00:03:40.400> so<00:03:40.520> you

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
in here won't decrease anymore so you

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.150 
in here won't decrease anymore so you
know<00:03:40.760> this<00:03:40.910> is<00:03:41.120> completely<00:03:41.840> topped<00:03:42.320> off<00:03:42.530> so

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
know this is completely topped off so

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.980 
know this is completely topped off so
now<00:03:43.310> we'll<00:03:43.520> just<00:03:43.550> unscrew<00:03:44.150> this<00:03:44.300> move<00:03:44.600> over<00:03:44.840> to

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:44.990 
now we'll just unscrew this move over to

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.260 
now we'll just unscrew this move over to
the<00:03:45.050> tank<00:03:45.410> fill<00:03:45.980> that<00:03:46.160> one<00:03:46.340> up<00:03:46.460> and<00:03:46.610> job<00:03:47.030> done

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:47.270 
the tank fill that one up and job done

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.260 
the tank fill that one up and job done
okay<00:03:47.480> so<00:03:48.320> we<00:03:48.560> have<00:03:48.680> this<00:03:48.830> one<00:03:49.040> in<00:03:49.160> place<00:03:49.340> just

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270 
okay so we have this one in place just

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.320 
okay so we have this one in place just
filled<00:03:50.570> it<00:03:50.720> just<00:03:51.530> like<00:03:51.710> the<00:03:51.860> other<00:03:51.980> tank

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
filled it just like the other tank

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:56.440 
filled it just like the other tank
simply<00:03:53.330> push<00:03:53.540> down<00:03:54.670> the<00:03:55.670> one-way<00:03:56.030> valve<00:03:56.060> does

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
simply push down the one-way valve does

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.970 
simply push down the one-way valve does
its<00:03:56.630> thing<00:03:56.690> and<00:03:58.270> fill<00:03:59.270> er<00:03:59.300> up

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
its thing and fill er up

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.260 
its thing and fill er up
and<00:04:01.480> as<00:04:02.480> I<00:04:02.630> do<00:04:02.690> this<00:04:03.020> I'm<00:04:03.260> able<00:04:03.560> to<00:04:03.890> keep<00:04:04.270> this

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:05.270 
and as I do this I'm able to keep this

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.690 
and as I do this I'm able to keep this
hose<00:04:06.110> in<00:04:06.530> here<00:04:06.709> the<00:04:06.830> whole<00:04:06.860> time<00:04:07.310> and<00:04:07.640> just

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
hose in here the whole time and just

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.850 
hose in here the whole time and just
push<00:04:08.630> down<00:04:08.930> so<00:04:09.650> it<00:04:09.770> really<00:04:11.709> minimizes<00:04:12.709> the

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
push down so it really minimizes the

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.060 
push down so it really minimizes the
risk<00:04:13.130> of<00:04:13.370> a<00:04:13.580> big<00:04:14.360> spill<00:04:14.780> and<00:04:14.990> this<00:04:15.800> makes<00:04:15.980> it

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
risk of a big spill and this makes it

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.190 
risk of a big spill and this makes it
very<00:04:16.100> easy<00:04:16.400> for<00:04:16.520> one<00:04:16.850> person<00:04:16.880> to<00:04:17.270> do<00:04:17.420> it's<00:04:17.959> just

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
very easy for one person to do it's just

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.400 
very easy for one person to do it's just
a<00:04:18.530> simple<00:04:19.130> matter<00:04:19.370> of<00:04:19.609> filling<00:04:20.230> pushing<00:04:21.230> down

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
a simple matter of filling pushing down

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.550 
a simple matter of filling pushing down
filling<00:04:21.980> pushing<00:04:22.280> down<00:04:22.460> over<00:04:23.030> and<00:04:23.150> over<00:04:23.210> until

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
filling pushing down over and over until

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.470 
filling pushing down over and over until
the<00:04:24.560> tank<00:04:24.770> is<00:04:24.920> filled<00:04:25.250> all<00:04:26.000> right<00:04:26.180> so<00:04:26.330> there

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
the tank is filled all right so there

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.440 
the tank is filled all right so there
you<00:04:26.570> have<00:04:26.600> it<00:04:26.990> all<00:04:27.530> filled<00:04:28.310> up<00:04:28.640> minimal

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
you have it all filled up minimal

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.420 
you have it all filled up minimal
spilling<00:04:29.870> just<00:04:30.050> wipe<00:04:30.200> up<00:04:30.410> whatever<00:04:31.280> little

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
spilling just wipe up whatever little

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.130 
spilling just wipe up whatever little
drops<00:04:31.730> are<00:04:31.910> maybe<00:04:32.060> but<00:04:32.480> there<00:04:32.690> really<00:04:32.840> wasn't

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
drops are maybe but there really wasn't

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.640 
drops are maybe but there really wasn't
much<00:04:33.290> I<00:04:33.680> got<00:04:34.460> the<00:04:34.580> caps<00:04:34.820> back<00:04:34.970> on<00:04:35.410> just<00:04:36.410> got<00:04:36.530> to

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
much I got the caps back on just got to

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.180 
much I got the caps back on just got to
put<00:04:36.830> the<00:04:37.360> intake<00:04:38.360> pipe<00:04:38.600> back<00:04:39.290> on<00:04:39.530> and<00:04:39.800> you're

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
put the intake pipe back on and you're

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:43.120 
put the intake pipe back on and you're
all<00:04:40.400> set<00:04:40.820> so<00:04:41.360> expect<00:04:41.750> to<00:04:41.870> do<00:04:42.050> this<00:04:42.290> every<00:04:43.100> time

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
all set so expect to do this every time
