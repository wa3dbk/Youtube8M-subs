00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
easy to put together it was five pieces

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.970 
easy to put together it was five pieces
the<00:01:01.550> four<00:01:01.850> sides<00:01:02.210> and<00:01:02.450> the<00:01:02.900> top<00:01:03.110> a<00:01:03.410> bunch<00:01:03.830> of

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
screws you tap them in and you were good

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.290 
screws you tap them in and you were good
to<00:01:06.080> go<00:01:06.110> and<00:01:06.530> you<00:01:06.800> can<00:01:06.979> see<00:01:07.160> how<00:01:07.190> much<00:01:07.880> we<00:01:08.270> can

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300 
to go and you can see how much we can

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.330 
to go and you can see how much we can
fit<00:01:08.630> in<00:01:08.750> here<00:01:08.930> in<00:01:09.050> terms<00:01:09.229> of<00:01:09.410> containers<00:01:09.920> you

fit in here in terms of containers you

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.340 
fit in here in terms of containers you
could<00:01:10.670> also<00:01:10.910> place<00:01:11.330> us<00:01:11.540> directly<00:01:12.080> in<00:01:12.290> your

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
could also place us directly in your

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.950 
could also place us directly in your
garden<00:01:12.860> and<00:01:13.100> use<00:01:13.640> the<00:01:13.850> ground<00:01:14.240> instead<00:01:14.840> of

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
garden and use the ground instead of

this time of the year things do not dry

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:23.950 
this time of the year things do not dry
out<00:01:21.290> nearly<00:01:21.920> as<00:01:22.160> quickly<00:01:22.520> I'll<00:01:23.360> continue<00:01:23.810> to

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
out nearly as quickly I'll continue to

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.830 
out nearly as quickly I'll continue to
grow<00:01:24.229> in<00:01:24.259> here<00:01:24.590> as<00:01:24.710> late<00:01:24.830> as<00:01:24.890> possible<00:01:25.040> if<00:01:25.840> it

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
grow in here as late as possible if it

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.870 
grow in here as late as possible if it
gets<00:01:26.930> real<00:01:27.259> cold<00:01:27.530> you<00:01:27.830> could<00:01:28.130> even<00:01:28.280> cover<00:01:28.670> this

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
gets real cold you could even cover this

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.540 
gets real cold you could even cover this
at<00:01:29.060> night<00:01:29.210> with<00:01:29.420> a<00:01:29.450> heavy<00:01:29.690> blanket<00:01:30.050> or<00:01:30.530> a<00:01:31.280> heavy

at night with a heavy blanket or a heavy
tarp<00:01:32.030> that<00:01:32.420> would<00:01:32.600> help<00:01:32.720> you<00:01:32.960> to<00:01:33.140> protect<00:01:33.500> your

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
tarp that would help you to protect your

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.160 
tarp that would help you to protect your
plants<00:01:33.920> even<00:01:34.220> longer<00:01:34.580> and<00:01:34.940> in<00:01:35.390> the<00:01:35.509> spring<00:01:35.840> I

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
plants even longer and in the spring I

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.770 
plants even longer and in the spring I
can<00:01:36.410> start<00:01:36.800> seeds<00:01:37.190> inside<00:01:37.610> here<00:01:37.940> many<00:01:38.450> weeks

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
can start seeds inside here many weeks

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.450 
can start seeds inside here many weeks
before<00:01:39.290> I<00:01:39.320> would<00:01:39.530> otherwise<00:01:39.979> be<00:01:40.040> able<00:01:40.310> to

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
before I would otherwise be able to

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:41.770 
before I would otherwise be able to
start<00:01:40.729> them<00:01:40.910> and<00:01:41.060> that<00:01:41.330> has<00:01:41.450> the<00:01:41.630> natural

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
start them and that has the natural

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.779 
start them and that has the natural
sunlight<00:01:42.350> as<00:01:42.710> opposed<00:01:43.220> to<00:01:43.310> having<00:01:43.460> to<00:01:43.640> use

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:43.789 
sunlight as opposed to having to use

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:45.520 
sunlight as opposed to having to use
artificial<00:01:44.300> light<00:01:44.630> as<00:01:44.810> I<00:01:45.050> would<00:01:45.170> have<00:01:45.289> to<00:01:45.440> do

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
artificial light as I would have to do

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.100 
artificial light as I would have to do
inside<00:01:46.039> a<00:01:46.310> cold<00:01:47.030> frame<00:01:47.240> is<00:01:47.420> a<00:01:47.450> great<00:01:47.840> way<00:01:48.050> to

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
inside a cold frame is a great way to

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.320 
inside a cold frame is a great way to
extend<00:01:48.470> the<00:01:48.710> season<00:01:48.920> especially<00:01:49.340> with<00:01:50.060> greens

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
extend the season especially with greens

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.210 
extend the season especially with greens
like<00:01:50.569> arugula<00:01:50.750> you'll<00:01:51.530> be<00:01:51.619> eating<00:01:51.770> these<00:01:51.979> for

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220
