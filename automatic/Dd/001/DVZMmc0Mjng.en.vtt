00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
that they will fix a connection with the

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.620 
that they will fix a connection with the
wii<00:02:34.350> u<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:34.880> I've<00:02:35.880> heard<00:02:36.180> how<00:02:36.390> they're<00:02:36.570> gonna

think in Brawl i forgiven was yeah it

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:15.949 
think in Brawl i forgiven was yeah it
was<00:04:14.700> a<00:04:14.730> stage<00:04:15.000> at<00:04:15.239> they<00:04:15.330> went<00:04:15.540> there<00:04:15.780> in<00:04:15.900> the

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
was a stage at they went there in the

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.360 
was a stage at they went there in the
background<00:04:16.109> the<00:04:16.380> stage<00:04:16.560> and<00:04:16.799> they<00:04:16.950> controlled

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
background the stage and they controlled

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:19.130 
background the stage and they controlled
random<00:04:18.120> elements<00:04:18.479> that<00:04:18.540> happen<00:04:18.810> in<00:04:18.900> this<00:04:18.959> age

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
random elements that happen in this age

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.810 
random elements that happen in this age
but<00:04:19.919> they<00:04:20.010> could<00:04:20.130> probably<00:04:20.310> like<00:04:20.580> have<00:04:20.850> a

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820

but they could probably like have a
restaurant<00:04:23.820> or<00:04:24.090> whatever<00:04:24.330> that<00:04:24.419> other<00:04:24.539> 18

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
whatever that other name is because i

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.440 
whatever that other name is because i

I<00:04:27.660> in<00:04:28.200> the<00:04:28.380> into<00:04:28.770> other<00:04:28.950> stages<00:04:29.250> into<00:04:29.580> the<00:04:29.940> next

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
I in the into other stages into the next

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.900 
I in the into other stages into the next
game<00:04:30.360> so<00:04:30.990> things<00:04:31.620> probably<00:04:31.890> have<00:04:32.250> their<00:04:32.400> art<00:04:32.610> I

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910

think like yeah you mentioned like okami
I<00:04:35.070> think<00:04:35.400> I<00:04:35.720> mathura<00:04:36.720> zoo<00:04:36.990> or<00:04:37.170> whatever<00:04:37.470> would

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
I think I mathura zoo or whatever would

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.590 
I think I mathura zoo or whatever would
be<00:04:37.830> like<00:04:37.980> really<00:04:38.010> cool<00:04:38.550> especially<00:04:39.180> since

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
be like really cool especially since

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.150 
be like really cool especially since
that<00:04:39.750> franchise<00:04:40.230> seems<00:04:40.470> to<00:04:40.560> be<00:04:40.650> like<00:04:40.770> growing

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
that franchise seems to be like growing

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.150 
that franchise seems to be like growing
like<00:04:41.370> Okamiden<00:04:41.970> and<00:04:42.120> stuff<00:04:42.650> yeah<00:04:43.650> another

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
like Okamiden and stuff yeah another

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.410 
like Okamiden and stuff yeah another
thing<00:04:44.490> that<00:04:44.520> a<00:04:44.730> lot<00:04:44.850> of<00:04:45.000> people<00:04:45.090> have<00:04:45.390> been

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:45.420 
thing that a lot of people have been

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.750 
thing that a lot of people have been
bringing<00:04:45.780> up<00:04:45.870> is<00:04:46.020> megaman<00:04:46.560> which<00:04:46.950> obviously<00:04:47.520> I

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:47.760 
bringing up is megaman which obviously I

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.820 
bringing up is megaman which obviously I
think<00:04:47.910> that'd<00:04:48.270> be<00:04:48.390> a<00:04:48.420> cool<00:04:48.690> cool<00:04:49.170> addition<00:04:49.620> for

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
think that'd be a cool cool addition for

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.100 
think that'd be a cool cool addition for
sure<00:04:50.010> um<00:04:50.340> it<00:04:51.270> seems<00:04:51.390> like<00:04:51.600> people<00:04:51.630> have<00:04:51.930> been
