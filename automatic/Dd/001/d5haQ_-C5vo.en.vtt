perfect color accuracy and this feature

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.010 
perfect color accuracy and this feature
we<00:01:21.360> call<00:01:21.740> dynamic<00:01:23.150> image<00:01:24.150> contrast<00:01:24.600> which

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
we call dynamic image contrast which

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.679 
we call dynamic image contrast which
basically<00:01:25.320> adjust<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:26.090> pixel<00:01:27.090> contrast<00:01:27.540> when

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
basically adjust the pixel contrast when

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.370 
basically adjust the pixel contrast when
you<00:01:27.780> go<00:01:27.900> from<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.110> dark<00:01:28.290> room<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.070> light<00:01:29.430> room
