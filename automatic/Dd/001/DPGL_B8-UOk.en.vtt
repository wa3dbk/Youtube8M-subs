one<00:00:00.900> of<00:00:00.989> the<00:00:01.050> problems<00:00:01.680> that<00:00:01.770> I<00:00:01.800> have<00:00:02.100> is<00:00:02.250> when

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
one of the problems that I have is when

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:04.430 
one of the problems that I have is when
I<00:00:02.429> charge<00:00:02.730> a<00:00:02.909> big<00:00:03.120> for<00:00:03.750> any<00:00:03.929> battery<00:00:04.319> really

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
I charge a big for any battery really

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.900 
I charge a big for any battery really
but<00:00:04.650> the<00:00:04.740> big<00:00:04.859> batteries<00:00:05.220> especially<00:00:05.759> the

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
but the big batteries especially the

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.210 
but the big batteries especially the
success<00:00:06.270> five<00:00:06.509> thousands<00:00:06.990> if<00:00:07.649> I<00:00:07.799> can't<00:00:08.040> fly

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
success five thousands if I can't fly

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.009 
success five thousands if I can't fly
for<00:00:08.309> any<00:00:08.610> reason<00:00:08.940> like<00:00:09.210> if<00:00:09.389> I<00:00:09.480> crashed<00:00:09.719> my<00:00:09.780> big

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
for any reason like if I crashed my big

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.009 
for any reason like if I crashed my big
plane<00:00:10.230> as<00:00:10.679> I<00:00:10.860> did<00:00:11.010> on<00:00:11.250> Wednesday<00:00:11.670> night<00:00:12.090> I<00:00:12.360> have

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
plane as I did on Wednesday night I have

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.259 
plane as I did on Wednesday night I have
to<00:00:13.679> run<00:00:14.190> I<00:00:14.400> had<00:00:14.639> no<00:00:14.759> way<00:00:14.880> of<00:00:14.910> finding<00:00:15.059> the

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
to run I had no way of finding the

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.640 
to run I had no way of finding the
batteries<00:00:15.540> down<00:00:15.660> a<00:00:15.719> storage<00:00:16.080> charge<00:00:16.350> in<00:00:16.560> any

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
batteries down a storage charge in any

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.700 
batteries down a storage charge in any
sensible<00:00:17.160> time<00:00:17.390> so<00:00:18.390> I<00:00:18.810> thought<00:00:19.350> it'd<00:00:19.500> be<00:00:19.560> good

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
sensible time so I thought it'd be good

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.980 
sensible time so I thought it'd be good
to<00:00:19.770> have<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:19.980> light<00:00:20.550> bulb<00:00:20.730> rig<00:00:21.060> to<00:00:21.270> do<00:00:21.420> this<00:00:21.630> and

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
to have a light bulb rig to do this and

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.890 
to have a light bulb rig to do this and

the capacity from for 15 bulbs but

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.560 
the capacity from for 15 bulbs but
initially<00:00:41.190> I've<00:00:41.489> only<00:00:41.640> got<00:00:41.879> eight<00:00:42.090> so<00:00:42.390> I've

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
initially I've only got eight so I've

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.610 
initially I've only got eight so I've
put<00:00:42.809> a<00:00:42.840> tin<00:00:43.230> they're<00:00:44.160> in<00:00:44.510> they're<00:00:45.510> in<00:00:45.620> series

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
put a tin they're in they're in series

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.889 
put a tin they're in they're in series
pairs<00:00:46.920> so<00:00:47.399> these<00:00:48.149> are<00:00:48.270> in<00:00:48.329> series<00:00:48.690> these<00:00:48.840> are

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
pairs so these are in series these are

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.290 
pairs so these are in series these are
in<00:00:49.020> series<00:00:49.320> has<00:00:49.469> four<00:00:49.680> pairs<00:00:50.070> because<00:00:51.030> they're

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
in series has four pairs because they're

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.639 
in series has four pairs because they're
12<00:00:51.510> volt<00:00:51.690> bulbs<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.170> I'm<00:00:52.289> going<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.469> run<00:00:52.620> a

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
12 volt bulbs and I'm going to run a

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.209 
12 volt bulbs and I'm going to run a
success<00:00:53.100> pack<00:00:53.370> which<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:53.960> 24<00:00:54.960> volts<00:00:55.320> give<00:00:56.100> or

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
success pack which is 24 volts give or

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.959 
success pack which is 24 volts give or
take<00:00:56.399> so<00:00:57.090> yeah<00:00:57.480> I've<00:00:57.750> got<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.579> turnaround<00:00:59.579> cuz<00:00:59.940> I

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
take so yeah I've got a turnaround cuz I

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.000 
take so yeah I've got a turnaround cuz I
think<00:01:00.120> it's<00:01:00.210> gonna<00:01:00.300> be<00:01:00.420> quite<00:01:00.510> blinding<00:01:01.109> I've

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
think it's gonna be quite blinding I've

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.990 
think it's gonna be quite blinding I've
got<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:03.470> can<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:04.559> see<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:04.860> yeah<00:01:05.640> I've<00:01:05.850> got<00:01:05.970> a

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
got a can you see that yeah I've got a

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.300 
got a can you see that yeah I've got a
current<00:01:06.330> meter<00:01:06.479> there<00:01:06.810> so<00:01:07.470> that<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.710> can<00:01:07.979> see

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
current meter there so that I can see

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.060 
current meter there so that I can see
the<00:01:09.320> current<00:01:10.320> or<00:01:10.590> if<00:01:10.680> I<00:01:10.830> move<00:01:10.979> this<00:01:11.189> over<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.549> bit

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
the current or if I move this over a bit

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:27.890 
the current or if I move this over a bit
and<00:01:14.070> I've<00:01:14.400> got<00:01:25.040> a<00:01:26.040> check<00:01:26.400> which<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.299> can<00:01:27.540> plug<00:01:27.750> in

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
and I've got a check which I can plug in

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.300 
and I've got a check which I can plug in
to<00:01:27.930> monitor<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.590> battery<00:01:28.950> while<00:01:29.130> I'm

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
to monitor the battery while I'm

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.370 
to monitor the battery while I'm
discharging<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:29.990> and<00:01:30.990> we're<00:01:31.200> gonna<00:01:31.320> see

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
discharging it and we're gonna see

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.090 
discharging it and we're gonna see
weapons<00:01:31.860> so<00:01:32.430> I<00:01:32.820> can<00:01:33.119> own<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.390> right<00:01:34.140> so<00:01:34.860> this

is the an amp meter watt meter sorry
this<00:01:39.450> is<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:41.420> my<00:01:42.420> lipo<00:01:42.899> checker<00:01:43.140> which<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.530> to

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
this is the my lipo checker which is to

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.730 
this is the my lipo checker which is to
keep<00:01:43.770> an<00:01:43.860> eye<00:01:43.950> on<00:01:43.979> them<00:01:44.220> and<00:01:45.170> I'm<00:01:46.170> gonna<00:01:46.500> plug

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
keep an eye on them and I'm gonna plug

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.859 
keep an eye on them and I'm gonna plug
in<00:01:46.860> now<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.189> see<00:01:47.310> what<00:01:47.369> happens<00:01:50.630> alright<00:01:51.630> so

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
in now and see what happens alright so

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.300 
in now and see what happens alright so
sharing<00:01:52.200> 24<00:01:52.590> volts<00:01:53.149> it's<00:01:54.149> quite<00:01:54.299> bright

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.310 
sharing 24 volts it's quite bright

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.880 
sharing 24 volts it's quite bright
twelve<00:01:56.310> point<00:01:56.850> two<00:01:57.000> amps<00:01:57.329> so<00:01:57.680> that's<00:01:58.680> pretty

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
twelve point two amps so that's pretty

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.850 
twelve point two amps so that's pretty
good<00:01:59.540> 300<00:02:00.540> watts<00:02:00.719> which<00:02:01.140> is<00:02:01.170> exactly<00:02:01.649> what<00:02:01.829> I

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
good 300 watts which is exactly what I

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.520 
good 300 watts which is exactly what I
hoped<00:02:02.040> for<00:02:02.869> so<00:02:03.869> that's<00:02:03.990> quite<00:02:04.259> good

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
hoped for so that's quite good

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:15.479 
hoped for so that's quite good
um<00:02:04.820> we've<00:02:05.820> got<00:02:05.850> volts<00:02:06.390> 12<00:02:06.570> amps

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.890 

okay<00:02:16.489> 12<00:02:16.790> and<00:02:16.879> 1/2<00:02:16.970> amps<00:02:17.209> with<00:02:17.330> peak<00:02:17.540> so<00:02:17.810> it's

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
okay 12 and 1/2 amps with peak so it's

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.699 
okay 12 and 1/2 amps with peak so it's
now<00:02:18.050> it's<00:02:18.800> hovering<00:02:19.069> around<00:02:19.250> 12<00:02:19.670> amps<00:02:20.480> so

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
now it's hovering around 12 amps so

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:28.050 
now it's hovering around 12 amps so
that's<00:02:21.709> still<00:02:21.950> pretty<00:02:22.069> good<00:02:23.170> so<00:02:24.340> 12<00:02:25.340> amps

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.490 

County<00:02:29.060> that's<00:02:29.209> still<00:02:29.450> running<00:02:29.720> 12<00:02:30.080> amps<00:02:32.500> and

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
County that's still running 12 amps and

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:40.420 
County that's still running 12 amps and
that's<00:02:33.709> four<00:02:33.920> volts<00:02:34.220> of<00:02:34.340> cell<00:02:34.690> 3.9<00:02:39.190> well<00:02:40.190> so

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
that's four volts of cell 3.9 well so

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.190 
that's four volts of cell 3.9 well so
that's<00:02:40.549> pretty<00:02:40.760> pretty<00:02:41.360> successful<00:02:41.989> you<00:02:42.080> can

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
that's pretty pretty successful you can

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.110 
that's pretty pretty successful you can
see<00:02:42.500> it's<00:02:43.160> quite<00:02:43.280> a<00:02:43.400> lot<00:02:43.519> of<00:02:43.870> light<00:02:45.970> coming<00:02:46.970> off

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
see it's quite a lot of light coming off

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.390 
see it's quite a lot of light coming off
that<00:02:47.360> it's<00:02:47.660> fairly<00:02:48.110> warm<00:02:48.560> not<00:02:49.040> actually

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
that it's fairly warm not actually

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.839 
that it's fairly warm not actually
ridiculous<00:02:50.680> and<00:02:51.680> this<00:02:51.799> is<00:02:51.920> a<00:02:51.980> welded<00:02:52.310> steel<00:02:52.549> so

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
ridiculous and this is a welded steel so

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:54.940 
ridiculous and this is a welded steel so
it<00:02:52.910> should<00:02:53.150> cope<00:02:53.360> with<00:02:53.510> the<00:02:53.569> temperature<00:02:54.049> so

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
it should cope with the temperature so

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.589 
it should cope with the temperature so
that<00:02:55.160> was<00:02:55.310> pretty<00:02:55.519> perfect<00:02:55.730> so<00:02:56.239> I<00:02:56.299> just<00:02:56.480> need

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 
that was pretty perfect so I just need

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:59.170 
that was pretty perfect so I just need
to<00:02:56.660> get<00:02:56.780> small<00:02:56.989> bulbs<00:02:57.410> and<00:02:57.620> then<00:02:57.890> I<00:02:58.190> can<00:02:59.060> back

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
to get small bulbs and then I can back

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.680 
to get small bulbs and then I can back
that<00:02:59.209> up<00:02:59.420> a<00:02:59.450> bit<00:02:59.540> with<00:02:59.870> a<00:03:00.040> with<00:03:01.040> a<00:03:01.069> full<00:03:01.310> set<00:03:01.610> of

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
that up a bit with a with a full set of

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.289 
that up a bit with a with a full set of
but<00:03:02.690> with<00:03:03.400> twelve<00:03:04.400> bulbs<00:03:04.760> I<00:03:04.849> should<00:03:05.000> get<00:03:05.120> about

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
but with twelve bulbs I should get about

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:07.690 
but with twelve bulbs I should get about
15<00:03:05.630> amps<00:03:05.959> which<00:03:06.440> is<00:03:06.620> it<00:03:07.099> is<00:03:07.310> enough<00:03:07.489> I<00:03:07.640> think

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
15 amps which is it is enough I think

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.759 
15 amps which is it is enough I think
that<00:03:08.690> that's<00:03:08.959> enough<00:03:09.200> thought<00:03:09.319> I<00:03:09.349> can<00:03:09.530> run<00:03:09.650> him

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
that that's enough thought I can run him

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.500 
that that's enough thought I can run him
down<00:03:09.829> him<00:03:10.099> in<00:03:10.730> a<00:03:10.790> reasonable<00:03:11.180> amount<00:03:11.329> of<00:03:11.420> time

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
down him in a reasonable amount of time

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
down him in a reasonable amount of time
tie<00:03:12.410> some<00:03:12.680> heat<00:03:12.829> coming<00:03:13.069> off<00:03:13.099> that<00:03:14.380> just<00:03:15.380> put

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
tie some heat coming off that just put

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:16.809 
tie some heat coming off that just put
my<00:03:15.620> hand<00:03:15.799> over<00:03:15.889> there<00:03:16.130> and<00:03:16.280> I<00:03:16.310> can<00:03:16.459> feel<00:03:16.639> quite

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
my hand over there and I can feel quite

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:28.420 
my hand over there and I can feel quite
a<00:03:17.000> lot<00:03:17.150> of<00:03:17.269> warmth<00:03:17.709> anyway<00:03:18.709> um<00:03:18.950> that<00:03:19.430> is<00:03:19.670> my

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.489
