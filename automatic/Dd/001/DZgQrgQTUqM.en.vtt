using<00:00:13.230> dotting<00:00:13.889> tools<00:00:14.330> you<00:00:15.330> can<00:00:15.480> use<00:00:15.509> them

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
using dotting tools you can use them

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.390 
using dotting tools you can use them
either<00:00:15.900> do<00:00:16.170> dots<00:00:16.440> or<00:00:16.710> you<00:00:16.740> can<00:00:16.920> use<00:00:17.039> them<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:17.310> do

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
either do dots or you can use them to do

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.599 
either do dots or you can use them to do
marbling<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.140> it's<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.320> really<00:00:19.680> cool<00:00:19.859> end

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
marbling and it's a really cool end

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.640

result<00:00:21.210> for<00:00:21.539> very<00:00:21.840> little<00:00:22.050> time<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.560> effort

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
result for very little time and effort

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.439

a few drops on a piece of tinfoil so
it's<00:00:43.770> easier<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.579> work<00:00:45.000> with<00:00:45.180> so<00:00:45.690> I'm<00:00:46.230> I've<00:00:46.590> got

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
it's easier to work with so I'm I've got

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.500 
it's easier to work with so I'm I've got
several<00:00:47.100> different<00:00:47.250> size<00:00:47.850> tools<00:00:48.360> I'm<00:00:48.480> going

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
several different size tools I'm going

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.770 
several different size tools I'm going
to<00:00:48.629> use<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.780> big<00:00:48.989> one<00:00:49.170> first<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:50.360> do<00:00:51.360> my<00:00:51.570> first

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
to use a big one first and do my first

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.549 
to use a big one first and do my first
dot<00:00:52.219> maybe<00:00:53.219> add<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.550> few<00:00:53.670> around<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.539> there's<00:00:55.260> no

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
dot maybe add a few around it there's no

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.970 
dot maybe add a few around it there's no
wrong<00:00:56.280> way<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.750> do<00:00:57.750> this<00:00:57.930> because<00:00:58.230> they<00:00:58.530> really

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
wrong way to do this because they really

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.290 
wrong way to do this because they really
make<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.190> so<00:00:59.640> simple<00:01:01.609> once<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.730> get<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:02.940> few

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
make it so simple once you get a few

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.810 
make it so simple once you get a few
dots<00:01:03.539> going<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:04.080> can<00:01:04.260> switch<00:01:04.470> tools<00:01:04.920> you<00:01:05.700> can

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
dots going you can switch tools you can

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.760 
dots going you can switch tools you can
go<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.090> different<00:01:06.330> size<00:01:06.840> I'm<00:01:07.470> going<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.650> go

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
go to a different size I'm going to go

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.510 
go to a different size I'm going to go
to<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.890> smaller<00:01:08.280> tool<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:10.280> embellish<00:01:11.280> what

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
to a smaller tool and embellish what

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.030 
to a smaller tool and embellish what
you've<00:01:11.700> done<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:15.110> like<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.229> dip<00:01:16.409> in<00:01:16.560> each<00:01:16.710> time

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
you've done I like to dip in each time

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.219 
you've done I like to dip in each time
sometimes<00:01:17.640> if<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:17.880> try<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.119> get<00:01:18.299> ahead<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.840> do

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
sometimes if you try to get ahead and do

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.580 
sometimes if you try to get ahead and do
multiple<00:01:19.439> dots<00:01:19.920> with<00:01:20.460> one<00:01:20.759> tool<00:01:21.060> one<00:01:21.659> dip<00:01:21.930> the

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
multiple dots with one tool one dip the

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
multiple dots with one tool one dip the
Polish<00:01:23.460> result<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.119> you<00:01:24.270> get<00:01:24.420> a<00:01:24.600> lighter<00:01:24.930> color

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
Polish result is you get a lighter color

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.840 
Polish result is you get a lighter color
so<00:01:26.630> if<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:28.380> want<00:01:28.770> a<00:01:28.890> lighter<00:01:29.100> color<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:29.640> can

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
so if you want a lighter color you can

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.649 
so if you want a lighter color you can
multiple<00:01:30.450> dot<00:01:31.229> with<00:01:31.619> one<00:01:31.860> dip<00:01:32.100> but<00:01:32.759> if<00:01:33.090> you

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
multiple dot with one dip but if you

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.200 
multiple dot with one dip but if you
want<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.439> have<00:01:34.590> really<00:01:34.950> good<00:01:35.340> solid<00:01:35.640> colors

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
want to have really good solid colors

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.749 
want to have really good solid colors
you<00:01:36.360> don't<00:01:36.540> want<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.869> dip<00:01:37.530> once<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.189> do<00:01:38.430> many

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
you don't want to dip once and do many

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.870 
you don't want to dip once and do many
dots<00:01:39.060> I'll<00:01:39.570> do<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.380> this<00:01:40.590> time<00:01:40.650> actually<00:01:41.159> I'm

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
dots I'll do it this time actually I'm

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.340 
dots I'll do it this time actually I'm
going<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.060> do<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.210> little<00:01:42.390> fade-out<00:01:42.930> so<00:01:43.259> I'm

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
going to do a little fade-out so I'm

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.260 
going to do a little fade-out so I'm
going<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.560> dip<00:01:44.070> once<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.850> I'm<00:01:44.970> going<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.180> do

going to dip once and I'm going to do

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.179 
going to dip once and I'm going to do
several<00:01:45.570> dots<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:46.380> can<00:01:46.560> see<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:47.009> they

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
several dots and you can see that they

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:53.149 
several dots and you can see that they
get<00:01:47.369> lighter<00:01:47.700> as<00:01:48.000> I<00:01:48.149> go<00:01:48.390> away<00:01:51.740> each<00:01:52.740> one<00:01:53.009> is

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
get lighter as I go away each one is

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.620 
get lighter as I go away each one is
just<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.549> little<00:01:53.970> lighter<00:01:54.180> than<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.540> one

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
just a little lighter than the one

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.950 
just a little lighter than the one
before<00:01:57.200> so<00:01:58.200> really<00:01:59.159> cool<00:01:59.399> look<00:01:59.759> very<00:02:00.600> quick

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
before so really cool look very quick

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.020 
before so really cool look very quick
very<00:02:01.320> easy<00:02:01.409> didn't<00:02:02.070> take<00:02:02.280> extra<00:02:02.610> time<00:02:02.820> in<00:02:02.939> your

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
very easy didn't take extra time in your

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.639 
very easy didn't take extra time in your
book<00:02:03.180> you<00:02:03.299> probably<00:02:03.329> kind<00:02:03.750> of<00:02:03.930> charged<00:02:04.200> per

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
book you probably kind of charged per

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
to keep stripes separated in different

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.509 
to keep stripes separated in different
colors<00:02:49.010> so<00:02:50.010> that<00:02:50.040> you<00:02:50.730> get<00:02:51.060> more<00:02:51.659> of<00:02:51.900> an<00:02:52.650> effect

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519
