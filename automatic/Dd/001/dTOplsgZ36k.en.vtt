00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.990
 mixed except that you speak welcome in 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.330
 this new video in which we will analyze 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.580
 the latest trailers released on 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.130
 new dlc devastation and the new 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.900
 extension media mode here at mister 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.910
 except that he speaks and I am in the company of 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.680
 mister frank hello guys so much desire 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.210
 for all I am a coach of 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.650
 man editor points and are already 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.910
 appeared on the channel together black in the 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.260
 series on al tas 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.670
 I also have a personal channel of which 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.710
 you will find linking description you can 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.749
 interest you I will have to analyze the 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.190
 multiplayer compartment 

00:00:34.749 --> 00:00:39.510
 let's start immediately with the first news 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.649
 re for a year a new weapon 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.269
 consists of two weapons in a bit like 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:46.329
 they saw with the maverick 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:49.539
 only this time the two weapons 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:50.949
 will be the choice between machine gun and 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:52.089
 Assault rifle 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:54.999
 however they will not be in two classes 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:57.010
 distinct because this this weapon is 

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:58.989
 in short, it can change class 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:03.339
 within the same lot as the 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:05.110
 match is played precisely and therefore it can 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:09.570
 go directly from machine gun e 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:13.210
 assault rifle while playing precisely 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.950
 it has a high radio of fire 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.160
 but this does not prove unstable 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.900
 and in fact the good capacity of the 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.670
 loader then also makes a valid one 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.760
 alternative to the meta real vector that 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:28.060
 let's say they are the most machine guns 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:30.250
 use this class to talk 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.220
 of maps the first map that comes to us 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.630
 also shown by a trailer ruiz 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.510
 small to medium sized map 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.620
 set in an archaeological site is 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.020
 structured according to a provision 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.930
 triangular of the flags on domain 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.310
 and also on several vertical levels is a 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.600
 as we have already seen on targeted 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.250
 black ops 2 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.190
 the peculiarity of the map is that 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.110
 contains two mission directives and the 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.240
 first consists of volcanic eruption 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.770
 while the second will allow players 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.680
 achieve the required objective at 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.140
 game of becoming a predator the race 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.970
 famous of the film series will have 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.310
 the same peculiarities seen in the movies 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.810
 that is, it will be invisible is the only way 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.039
 will have to eliminate enemies will be between 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.709
 put the blades placed on the forearm 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.900
 the beak shows second map is a 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.000
 excavation platform placed in 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.500
 South America is a map that is said to be the most 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.939
 various styles of playing allowing both 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.310
 use of weapons or sniper than of 

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:23.480
 machine guns for enclosed spaces 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.189
 completing the resignation directives on 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.900
 player can shoot from a minigun 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:28.400
 placed on a reconnaissance helicopter 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.659
 similar complex decision in the 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.430
 present on black ops 1 collison map 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:36.470
 formed by the clash of an oil tanker 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.639
 with bridge thus creating a cluster of 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.260
 wreckage 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:40.579
 here too the map is small 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.439
 dimensions favoring clashes 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:44.209
 close together that will certainly reward you 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:46.099
 the use of machine gun guns a 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.720
 pump by completing the management of 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:49.609
 mission you can carry out a raid 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.069
 plane similar to the warthog of black ops 2 

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:55.040
 but controlled by the player himself 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.720
 the last hearted map is a remake of 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.280
 zombi moder warfare 3 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.769
 this map will bring the player into a 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.150
 excavation site of an alien artifact 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.530
 for this reason there will be 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.689
 of the elements attributable to the 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.280
 extension mode with a presence of 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:08.900
 real mix that can be used 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.329
 through an easter egg not yet everything 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.980
 defined as directives resignation and then 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:14.870
 the searchers will be called in the field 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:18.169
 that will throw on the enemies a little 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.970
 like unit k9 the last reference is 

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:21.620
 that on the cases you can see the logo 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.760
 of the nightfall project and therefore it can 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.530
 affirm that the setting is 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.479
 certainly that of an excavation at the 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.729
 search for cryptids well 

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:32.180
 having said that we leave the word to coach 

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:33.739
 except that he will talk about extensions 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.870
 Here we are finally guys talking about 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.430
 new mayday in extension chapter 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.409
 one of the ship's corridors we can from 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.790
 immediately notice the bulldog returning 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:42.290
 as an affordable weapon in this 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.310
 modality as we had already seen in 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.139
 previous chapters 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.030
 immediately after we see the damage caused 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:48.680
 from the e.on aliens and they studied them 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.840
 just like in the nightfall su project 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.060
 a small table we can then notice the 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.650
 turret above a btr is one on a plane 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.209
 raised so it will surely be 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.400
 possible to buy the turret for 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.750
 use it from a fixed location 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.639
 it is also possible to note the 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.280
 reinsertion of the lockers already seen 

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:07.120
 in chapter 1 nightfall then also the 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.459
 return of the related keys to find 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.019
 on the ground when you also dig this 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.730
 chapter introduces the new weapon 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:14.739
 characteristic of the dlc as it was already 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.060
 done in the previous chapter 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:20.739
 only this time we have the rapper 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:23.050
 you also see the cb jms in the m27 jump 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.520
 which of the two is not clear 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.650
 weapons already known as some rifles 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:28.540
 assault regarding the good 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.100
 we can see three enhancements 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:32.110
 the blue one of lightning the red one of 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.460
 fire and the green one of acid though 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.560
 still it is not entirely clear how 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.570
 we can get the individual by talking about the 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.070
 crac instead we can say that it 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:40.720
 we will certainly find revolt during 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.310
 gameplay just like brit air in 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.449
 nightfall is definitely going to be 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:45.370
 tear down his tentacles in 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:47.500
 replacement to the already known wall hives 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:50.199
 which we found in the previous ones 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.479
 chapters to one of the two- thirds maps 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:54.669
 on the map the last clash instead 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:56.380
 almost certainly will happen far from the 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:57.789
 submarine because you can see the 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.740
 presence of two boats from 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:01.360
 use for escape and it also shows 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.860
 one of the soldiers running away from the 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.750
 cryptids to throw at one of them 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.729
 the clashes will take place both on 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.710
 surface of the submarine itself both 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:10.630
 in the corridors and more interior spaces 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.700
 among the novelties we see the new ones but 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:14.349
 the new excuse the first one is 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:16.210
 very similar to the electric trap already 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:17.650
 view in transit on black ops 2 while 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.599
 the other is a platform that has it 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.220
 same effect as the ipno knife e 

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:22.539
 so if you do jump over to 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:24.550
 range of action one of the cryptids 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:27.130
 three enemies will become your ally 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:29.380
 we find the money already found in others 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:31.120
 chapters with the addition of the sider a 

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.520
 new TV clip halfway between the seekers of 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.229
 scorpions capable of generating fate 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.419
 of mini hives with the function of 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:39.639
 turrets is a revisited version of the 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:40.660
 from the aesthetic point of view well 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:42.490
 guys that's all that 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.900
 we had given the crossroads regarding the recent ones 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.130
 released trailers 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.660
 if you have noticed anything else there 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:47.949
 we invite you to report us not in the comments 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.300
 I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:51.130
 I remind you to leave a live 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.660
 subscribe to the magna channel and watch 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:55.539
 the other videos featured are August 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:58.229
 from mister salvo and mister frank and so much 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:05:58.229
 one is for everyone
