that was bad timing anyway so basically
the<00:00:36.540> idea<00:00:36.570> behind<00:00:36.899> this<00:00:37.140> is<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:37.320> tell<00:00:37.559> five

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800

the idea behind this is you tell five
facts<00:00:38.129> about<00:00:38.399> yourself<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.879> I<00:00:38.940> figure<00:00:39.180> all<00:00:39.210> as

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
facts about yourself and I figure all as

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:40.819 
facts about yourself and I figure all as
long<00:00:39.600> as<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:39.780> don't<00:00:39.930> have<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.079> computer<00:00:40.590> to<00:00:40.710> do

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
designed the whole RPG and the concept

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:43.629 
designed the whole RPG and the concept
behind<00:03:42.530> it<00:03:42.859> was<00:03:43.010> that<00:03:43.129> there<00:03:43.220> were<00:03:43.310> like<00:03:43.459> two

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:43.639 
behind it was that there were like two

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:44.920 
behind it was that there were like two
versions<00:03:44.090> of<00:03:44.180> the<00:03:44.299> world<00:03:44.419> and<00:03:44.659> one<00:03:44.780> of<00:03:44.810> them

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
versions of the world and one of them

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.140 
versions of the world and one of them
was<00:03:45.049> backwards<00:03:45.620> from<00:03:45.859> the<00:03:45.979> other<00:03:46.129> one<00:03:46.400> like

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
was backwards from the other one like

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.939 
was backwards from the other one like
literally<00:03:47.449> backwards<00:03:48.139> that<00:03:48.440> the<00:03:48.590> monsters

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:48.949 
literally backwards that the monsters

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:51.550 
literally backwards that the monsters
were<00:03:49.129> a<00:03:49.159> lot<00:03:49.340> harder<00:03:49.609> and<00:03:50.319> then<00:03:51.319> like<00:03:51.440> the

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
were a lot harder and then like the

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.250 
were a lot harder and then like the
final<00:03:51.889> boss<00:03:52.069> was<00:03:52.370> our<00:03:52.639> goal<00:03:53.000> which<00:03:53.510> is<00:03:53.540> libros

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
final boss was our goal which is libros

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.869 
final boss was our goal which is libros

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
actually just won't do it because it

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.040 
actually just won't do it because it
makes<00:05:30.270> you<00:05:30.390> look<00:05:30.480> like<00:05:31.290> a<00:05:31.350> kid<00:05:31.680> a<00:05:31.710> tear<00:05:31.920> like
