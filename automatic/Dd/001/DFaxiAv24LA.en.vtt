00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
and I I picked it up mostly because I

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.730 
and I I picked it up mostly because I
like<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:08.849> two<00:00:09.090> female<00:00:09.570> planeswalkers<00:00:10.500> that

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
like the two female planeswalkers that

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.910 
like the two female planeswalkers that
are<00:00:10.860> out<00:00:10.980> right<00:00:11.010> now<00:00:11.400> which<00:00:11.610> are<00:00:11.730> Chandra<00:00:12.389> and

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:12.920 
are out right now which are Chandra and

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.580 
are out right now which are Chandra and
Liliana<00:00:13.920> but<00:00:14.580> it's<00:00:15.360> a<00:00:15.570> burn<00:00:15.870> deck<00:00:16.170> which<00:00:16.410> I'm

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
Liliana but it's a burn deck which I'm

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.680 
Liliana but it's a burn deck which I'm
thinking<00:00:17.010> of<00:00:17.130> making<00:00:17.369> something<00:00:17.880> similar<00:00:18.480> to

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
thinking of making something similar to

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.210 
thinking of making something similar to
and<00:00:18.930> I<00:00:18.960> was<00:00:19.080> hoping<00:00:19.380> there<00:00:19.529> would<00:00:19.590> be<00:00:19.650> parts<00:00:20.070> in

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
and I was hoping there would be parts in

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.800 
and I was hoping there would be parts in
here<00:00:20.490> even<00:00:21.119> though<00:00:21.210> I<00:00:21.240> know<00:00:21.359> that<00:00:21.630> these<00:00:21.750> are

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
here even though I know that these are

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.590 
here even though I know that these are
intend<00:00:22.519> cards<00:00:23.519> that<00:00:23.730> would<00:00:23.820> be<00:00:23.970> usable<00:00:24.359> so

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
intend cards that would be usable so

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.960 
intend cards that would be usable so
this<00:00:24.779> is<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.130> Chandra<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.310> large<00:00:26.550> deck

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970

player that makes him very effective the

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.130 
player that makes him very effective the
only<00:01:30.900> downside<00:01:31.380> is<00:01:31.409> he's<00:01:31.829> only<00:01:32.100> got<00:01:32.430> one<00:01:33.299> for

only downside is he's only got one for
his<00:01:34.409> his<00:01:35.280> toughness<00:01:35.970> so<00:01:36.180> that's<00:01:36.360> kind<00:01:36.659> of<00:01:36.780> bad

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
his his toughness so that's kind of bad

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.260 
his his toughness so that's kind of bad
now<00:01:37.890> these<00:01:38.700> are<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.259> lands<00:01:40.759> I'm<00:01:41.759> trying<00:01:42.150> to

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
now these are the lands I'm trying to

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.730 
now these are the lands I'm trying to
see<00:01:42.390> if<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.600> art<00:01:42.810> is<00:01:42.960> interesting<00:01:43.500> but<00:01:43.619> it

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
see if the art is interesting but it

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.190 
see if the art is interesting but it
looks<00:01:43.920> like<00:01:44.100> pretty<00:01:44.340> standard<00:01:44.909> m10<00:01:45.509> art<00:01:45.869> I

looks like pretty standard m10 art I

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.690 
looks like pretty standard m10 art I
wonder<00:01:46.710> how<00:01:46.860> many<00:01:46.920> mountains<00:01:47.399> there<00:01:47.549> I'll

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
wonder how many mountains there I'll

drops in this deck yet so I'm hoping to
run<00:04:04.709> into<00:04:04.769> those<00:04:05.130> soon<00:04:06.170> Pyromancer<00:04:07.170> he<00:04:07.560> taps

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:07.859 
run into those soon Pyromancer he taps

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:09.770 
run into those soon Pyromancer he taps
to<00:04:08.070> deal<00:04:08.250> one<00:04:08.459> damage<00:04:08.670> but<00:04:09.120> he<00:04:09.209> is<00:04:09.329> a<00:04:09.480> three

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
to deal one damage but he is a three

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.420 
to deal one damage but he is a three
drop<00:04:10.079> he<00:04:10.890> is<00:04:12.470> not<00:04:13.470> much<00:04:13.680> better<00:04:13.920> than<00:04:14.130> a<00:04:14.160> fire

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
drop he is not much better than a fire

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.340 
drop he is not much better than a fire
slinger<00:04:14.910> I<00:04:14.940> guess<00:04:15.209> he<00:04:15.359> can<00:04:15.510> target<00:04:15.780> creatures

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
slinger I guess he can target creatures

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.580 
slinger I guess he can target creatures
with<00:04:16.560> his<00:04:16.709> ability<00:04:17.130> but<00:04:17.280> that's<00:04:17.430> about<00:04:17.760> it

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
with his ability but that's about it

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.330 
with his ability but that's about it
goblin<00:04:19.590> sky<00:04:19.950> riders<00:04:20.840> they<00:04:21.840> have<00:04:22.169> flying<00:04:22.770> so<00:04:23.310> I

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
goblin sky riders they have flying so I

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.950 
goblin sky riders they have flying so I
guess<00:04:23.580> that<00:04:23.789> they're<00:04:24.030> better<00:04:24.990> at<00:04:25.560> deal

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
guess that they're better at deal

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.870 
guess that they're better at deal
damaged<00:04:26.440> because<00:04:26.680> they<00:04:26.979> can<00:04:27.130> bypass<00:04:27.340> things

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
damaged because they can bypass things

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.850

Phoenix<00:06:05.889> is<00:06:06.039> worthless<00:06:06.550> so<00:06:06.759> I<00:06:06.789> guess<00:06:07.030> I<00:06:07.180> did

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:07.389 
Phoenix is worthless so I guess I did

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:09.810 
Phoenix is worthless so I guess I did
not<00:06:07.570> get<00:06:07.750> anything<00:06:08.110> cool<00:06:08.380> from<00:06:08.650> my<00:06:08.800> pack<00:06:09.070> but

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:09.820
