00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.260
 Y 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.950
 ah 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.080
 the gear pumps should be 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.789
 installed and put into operation 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.489
 correctly and carefully to ensure 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.949
 a good operation to examine a 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:36.050
 gear pump we are going to assemble the 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:38.629
 to a test bench and make it work 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.330
 as if it were installed in a machine 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:43.220
 real operating at the right pressure to the 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.410
 replace a gear pump 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.019
 we must always make sure that the 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.120
 equipment has been disconnected and that 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:52.280
 hydraulic oil and the components of the 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.769
 system have been trained 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.229
 completely check the levels of 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:01:00.140
 deposit oil and if necessary 

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:02.479
 I added oil to ensure the rotation 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.580
 adequate shaft and adjust the machine 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:06.610
 so that the unit will not suffer 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.790
 no harm 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.980
 Once the new pump is installed, check 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.320
 the assembly and coupling to ensure 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.909
 that the assembly and the alignment are 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.340
 correct 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.350
 they have the pump and the suction hose 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.610
 with oil and make sure there is no 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.220
 obstructions in the entry line 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.440
 Tighten all connections and make sure 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.400
 that the cylinders of the system are in 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.400
 retraction mode 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.310
 At this point we are ready to put 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:40.219
 to operate the pump at a speed 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.560
 vague and without any pressure reading in 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:44.450
 the system make sure that all the 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.700
 control valves are in a 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.250
 neutral position and that the valve 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.340
 main relief is completely 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.349
 open this first phase or stage should 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.780
 be done for at least three minutes 

00:01:54.349 --> 00:01:59.539
 to ensure that the system is 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.729
 Purged or air-free can sometimes 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:03.950
 it is necessary to open a connector in the 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.920
 highest point of the machine for 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.410
 release any trapped air before 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.440
 go to the second stage check if there 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.799
 some leak and the level of deposit if it is 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.930
 necessary I added oil now with the 

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:20.480
 motor at half speed turn the 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:23.940
 relief valve to 500 pounds of 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.610
 pressure and repeat the function cycle 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.800
 this must be done for another three minutes 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.530
 while it is inspecting that no 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.360
 there are leaks now with the engine at all 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.790
 speed in this third stage 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.460
 we increase the pressure to more than 1000 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.400
 pounds and we review the cycle once again 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:44.340
 of the functions after three minutes 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:47.010
 at this pressure and speed we examine 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.800
 for the last time if there is a leak in the 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.870
 deposit level now depending on the 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.570
 operating conditions we can 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.330
 adjust the main relief valve and 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:59.700
 so the unit is ready to work 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.860
 maximum capacity we recommend them 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.690
 always make sure that the adjustments and 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.550
 pressure levels do not exceed 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.270
 pump capacity with this 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.270
 process
