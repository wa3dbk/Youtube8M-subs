so<00:00:00.719> in<00:00:00.840> theory<00:00:01.079> you<00:00:01.410> might<00:00:01.589> have<00:00:02.129> an<00:00:02.220> idea<00:00:02.310> of

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
so in theory you might have an idea of

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.280 
so in theory you might have an idea of
what<00:00:02.939> a<00:00:02.970> literature<00:00:03.300> review<00:00:03.750> is<00:00:03.870> but<00:00:04.110> it<00:00:04.170> might

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
what a literature review is but it might

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
it's supposed to at least look like so

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
together and I'll put breaking news

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.410 
together and I'll put breaking news
without<00:01:01.829> quotes<00:01:02.460> even<00:01:02.879> though<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.059> seems<00:01:03.300> to

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
without quotes even though it seems to

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.469

be<00:01:03.510> an<00:01:03.600> accepted<00:01:04.019> term<00:01:04.229> I'm<00:01:04.799> okay<00:01:05.129> if<00:01:05.400> they<00:01:06.299> use

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
be an accepted term I'm okay if they use

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.109 
be an accepted term I'm okay if they use
social<00:01:06.780> media<00:01:06.960> and<00:01:07.320> just<00:01:07.590> news<00:01:07.799> by<00:01:07.979> itself<00:01:08.280> so

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
social media and just news by itself so

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.520 
social media and just news by itself so
sometimes<00:01:09.450> using<00:01:09.780> quotes<00:01:09.960> can<00:01:10.140> be<00:01:10.229> very

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
sometimes using quotes can be very

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.200 
sometimes using quotes can be very
limiting<00:01:10.890> so<00:01:11.100> just<00:01:11.280> be<00:01:11.369> careful<00:01:11.549> with<00:01:11.790> that<00:01:11.850> or

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
limiting so just be careful with that or

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.539 
limiting so just be careful with that or
it<00:01:12.360> can<00:01:12.479> be<00:01:12.540> really<00:01:12.780> helpful<00:01:13.189> so<00:01:14.189> go<00:01:14.340> ahead<00:01:14.430> and

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
it can be really helpful so go ahead and

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
about whether or not this is something

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.090 
about whether or not this is something
that<00:04:05.459> you<00:04:05.550> have<00:04:05.670> to<00:04:05.730> do<00:04:05.910> in<00:04:06.000> your<00:04:06.150> paper<00:04:06.390> okay

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
that you have to do in your paper okay

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.470 
that you have to do in your paper okay
they're<00:04:08.100> not<00:04:08.280> all<00:04:08.459> the<00:04:08.580> same<00:04:08.760> but<00:04:09.060> they're

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
they're not all the same but they're

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.570 
they're not all the same but they're
providing<00:04:09.870> the<00:04:09.930> same<00:04:10.140> idea<00:04:10.530> and<00:04:10.800> basically

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
providing the same idea and basically

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.790 
providing the same idea and basically
it's<00:04:11.880> just<00:04:11.970> where<00:04:12.480> does<00:04:12.989> this<00:04:13.110> research<00:04:13.350> fit

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
it's just where does this research fit

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.969 
it's just where does this research fit
in<00:04:13.980> context<00:04:14.670> of<00:04:15.570> what<00:04:16.140> you're<00:04:16.289> doing<00:04:16.620> okay

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
in context of what you're doing okay

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:18.500 
in context of what you're doing okay
it's<00:04:17.280> just<00:04:17.430> to<00:04:17.520> set<00:04:17.729> it<00:04:17.760> up<00:04:17.910> because<00:04:18.000> no<00:04:18.239> idea

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
it's just to set it up because no idea

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.510 
it's just to set it up because no idea
is<00:04:18.660> really<00:04:18.930> original<00:04:19.200> it<00:04:19.710> has<00:04:20.130> to<00:04:20.310> come<00:04:20.489> from

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:20.520 
is really original it has to come from

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:21.500 
is really original it has to come from
somewhere<00:04:21.060> and<00:04:21.120> that

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
somewhere and that

which you're identifying in your

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.700 
which you're identifying in your
literature<00:04:23.130> review<00:04:23.220> it's<00:04:24.030> setting<00:04:24.480> you<00:04:24.600> up

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
literature review it's setting you up

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.730 
literature review it's setting you up
for<00:04:25.710> where<00:04:26.060> your<00:04:27.060> researches<00:04:27.420> in<00:04:27.870> context<00:04:28.530> of

and 61% of them did so the previous day
that's<00:04:45.810> not<00:04:46.020> common<00:04:46.380> knowledge<00:04:46.410> where<00:04:46.920> did

some<00:04:54.540> scholars<00:04:54.870> defined<00:04:55.380> SNS<00:04:55.980> as<00:04:56.600> websites

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
some scholars defined SNS as websites

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.270 
some scholars defined SNS as websites
where<00:04:57.810> users<00:04:58.350> keep<00:04:58.560> their<00:04:58.740> profiles<00:04:59.070> and

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
where users keep their profiles and

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.890 
where users keep their profiles and
connector<00:04:59.580> get<00:04:59.730> connected<00:04:59.940> with<00:05:00.120> others<00:05:00.420> good

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
connector get connected with others good

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.430 
connector get connected with others good
to<00:05:01.080> know<00:05:01.110> okay<00:05:01.980> so<00:05:02.190> you<00:05:02.460> really<00:05:02.790> want<00:05:02.940> to<00:05:03.030> start

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
to know okay so you really want to start

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.490 
to know okay so you really want to start
from<00:05:04.440> the<00:05:04.500> basics<00:05:04.710> and<00:05:05.220> then<00:05:06.140> find<00:05:07.140> gaps<00:05:07.320> in

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
from the basics and then find gaps in

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.890 
from the basics and then find gaps in
the<00:05:07.560> research<00:05:07.680> so<00:05:08.100> set<00:05:08.550> it<00:05:08.670> up<00:05:08.790> like<00:05:09.000> what<00:05:09.840> are

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
the research so set it up like what are

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.900 
the research so set it up like what are
you<00:05:09.960> talking<00:05:10.110> about<00:05:10.440> like<00:05:10.710> what<00:05:10.920> is<00:05:11.040> your<00:05:11.220> idea

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
you talking about like what is your idea

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:12.860 
you talking about like what is your idea
where<00:05:12.180> did<00:05:12.300> it<00:05:12.330> come<00:05:12.540> from

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
where did it come from

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:18.980 
where did it come from
who<00:05:13.110> started<00:05:13.470> it<00:05:13.620> if<00:05:13.830> you<00:05:14.400> can<00:05:14.550> and<00:05:15.380> then<00:05:17.990> you

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
who started it if you can and then you

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:21.010 
who started it if you can and then you
kind<00:05:19.170> of<00:05:19.230> find<00:05:19.350> the<00:05:19.500> gaps<00:05:19.740> it's<00:05:20.130> very<00:05:20.670> specific

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
kind of find the gaps it's very specific

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.720 
kind of find the gaps it's very specific
to<00:05:22.020> your<00:05:22.440> topic<00:05:22.890> so<00:05:23.040> that's<00:05:23.220> why<00:05:23.310> it's<00:05:23.460> hard<00:05:23.550> to

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:23.730 
to your topic so that's why it's hard to

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:25.880 
to your topic so that's why it's hard to
talk<00:05:23.880> about<00:05:23.990> but<00:05:24.990> by<00:05:25.140> looking<00:05:25.500> at<00:05:25.620> a<00:05:25.650> few

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:25.890 
talk about but by looking at a few

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.950 
talk about but by looking at a few
examples<00:05:25.980> you'll<00:05:26.460> have<00:05:26.580> a<00:05:26.610> better<00:05:26.790> idea<00:05:26.960> and

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
examples you'll have a better idea and

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.720 
examples you'll have a better idea and
another<00:05:28.260> thing<00:05:28.530> is<00:05:28.680> to<00:05:28.980> look<00:05:29.220> at<00:05:29.370> all<00:05:29.460> of<00:05:29.490> these

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:29.730 
another thing is to look at all of these

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:33.610 
another thing is to look at all of these
great<00:05:29.910> citations<00:05:30.980> okay

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
great citations okay

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.740 
great citations okay
scholarly<00:05:34.620> articles<00:05:34.890> have<00:05:35.580> probably<00:05:36.540> taken

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:36.750 
scholarly articles have probably taken

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.280 
scholarly articles have probably taken
the<00:05:36.960> author<00:05:37.110> a<00:05:37.380> year<00:05:37.740> or<00:05:37.920> two<00:05:38.130> or<00:05:38.310> maybe<00:05:38.520> more

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
to complete prior to publication they

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.870 
to complete prior to publication they
spent<00:05:43.230> a<00:05:43.320> lot<00:05:43.350> of<00:05:43.650> time<00:05:44.220> putting<00:05:44.700> this

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 
spent a lot of time putting this

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.660 
spent a lot of time putting this
together<00:05:45.060> there's<00:05:46.020> been<00:05:46.200> editors<00:05:46.590> going<00:05:47.370> over

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:47.670 
together there's been editors going over

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:49.880 
together there's been editors going over
their<00:05:48.210> references<00:05:48.720> and<00:05:48.960> their<00:05:49.500> original
