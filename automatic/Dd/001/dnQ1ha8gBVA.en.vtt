00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
fantastic idea because it means you can

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.150 
fantastic idea because it means you can
mix<00:02:37.270> and<00:02:37.480> match<00:02:37.690> the<00:02:37.959> torsos<00:02:38.530> and<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:38.920> legs

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:42.850 
and the heads all together and it's just

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:44.820 
and the heads all together and it's just
brilliant<00:02:43.030> idea<00:02:43.600> it<00:02:43.720> really<00:02:43.870> is<00:02:44.200> this<00:02:44.530> is<00:02:44.590> a

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
brilliant idea it really is this is a

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.910 
brilliant idea it really is this is a

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
really awesome when built that is just

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.930 
really awesome when built that is just
like<00:04:11.860> amedeo<00:04:12.130> moment

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
like amedeo moment

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.210 
like amedeo moment
and<00:04:13.660> then<00:04:13.930> of<00:04:14.079> course<00:04:14.109> we've<00:04:14.620> got<00:04:14.650> another

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
and then of course we've got another

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.930 
and then of course we've got another
type<00:04:15.579> of<00:04:15.790> stroke<00:04:16.060> a<00:04:16.329> rt2<00:04:16.780> is<00:04:17.380> the<00:04:17.680> code<00:04:17.940> once

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
type of stroke a rt2 is the code once

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.750 
type of stroke a rt2 is the code once
again<00:04:19.239> all<00:04:19.419> different<00:04:20.039> different<00:04:21.039> poses<00:04:21.310> and

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
again all different different poses and

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.150 
again all different different poses and
so<00:04:21.910> forth<00:04:22.270> so<00:04:22.600> when<00:04:23.169> you<00:04:23.260> mix<00:04:23.500> and<00:04:23.770> match<00:04:23.919> the

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
so forth so when you mix and match the

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.670 
so forth so when you mix and match the
different<00:04:24.190> parts<00:04:25.090> you<00:04:25.330> can<00:04:25.990> get<00:04:26.140> a<00:04:26.169> really

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
different parts you can get a really

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.950 
different parts you can get a really
unique<00:04:27.270> combination<00:04:28.270> of

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
unique combination of
