my last update I've now managed to move
my<00:00:11.840> system<00:00:12.260> down<00:00:12.440> into<00:00:12.680> my<00:00:12.830> polytunnel

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:13.640 
my system down into my polytunnel

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.670 
my system down into my polytunnel
on<00:00:14.480> the<00:00:14.600> end<00:00:14.690> of<00:00:14.780> my<00:00:14.840> garden<00:00:15.230> which<00:00:15.350> was<00:00:15.380> down

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:15.680 
on the end of my garden which was down

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.640 
on the end of my garden which was down
there<00:00:15.950> so<00:00:16.580> now<00:00:16.759> I've<00:00:16.820> got<00:00:16.970> it<00:00:17.060> all<00:00:17.380> wired<00:00:18.380> in

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
there so now I've got it all wired in

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.169 
there so now I've got it all wired in
it's<00:00:19.070> a<00:00:19.160> little<00:00:19.249> bit<00:00:19.429> messy<00:00:19.640> at<00:00:19.820> the<00:00:19.880> moment

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:20.179 
it's a little bit messy at the moment

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:23.079 
it's a little bit messy at the moment
but<00:00:20.359> I<00:00:20.509> need<00:00:20.660> to<00:00:20.779> do<00:00:20.900> some<00:00:21.050> tighten<00:00:21.380> up<00:00:21.849> so<00:00:22.849> now

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:23.089 
but I need to do some tighten up so now

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:25.749 
but I need to do some tighten up so now
have<00:00:23.300> my<00:00:23.480> clay<00:00:24.109> pebble<00:00:24.499> grow<00:00:24.949> media<00:00:25.279> in<00:00:25.429> and

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:25.759 
have my clay pebble grow media in and

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:29.849 
have my clay pebble grow media in and
I'm<00:00:26.720> now<00:00:26.929> just<00:00:27.230> doing<00:00:27.409> my<00:00:27.619> first<00:00:28.480> test

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:29.859 
I'm now just doing my first test

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:31.870 
I'm now just doing my first test
obviously<00:00:30.859> because<00:00:31.249> now<00:00:31.460> that<00:00:31.519> I've<00:00:31.669> got<00:00:31.789> the

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
obviously because now that I've got the

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.340 
obviously because now that I've got the
media<00:00:32.149> and<00:00:32.270> this<00:00:32.359> is<00:00:32.480> going<00:00:32.629> to<00:00:32.689> change<00:00:32.960> the

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
media and this is going to change the

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.279 
media and this is going to change the
rate<00:00:34.129> in<00:00:34.280> which<00:00:34.629> the<00:00:35.629> pumps<00:00:35.930> going<00:00:36.079> to<00:00:36.140> flow

00:00:36.279 --> 00:00:36.289 
rate in which the pumps going to flow

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:38.139 
rate in which the pumps going to flow
the<00:00:36.410> water<00:00:36.590> in<00:00:36.859> versus<00:00:37.399> what's<00:00:37.820> going<00:00:37.940> to<00:00:37.969> come

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149 
the water in versus what's going to come

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:40.209 
the water in versus what's going to come
out<00:00:38.300> from<00:00:38.480> my<00:00:38.510> bell<00:00:38.840> siphon<00:00:39.079> so<00:00:39.500> I'm<00:00:40.070> gonna

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:40.219 
out from my bell siphon so I'm gonna

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:41.259 
out from my bell siphon so I'm gonna
needs<00:00:40.399> to<00:00:40.519> do<00:00:40.640> a<00:00:40.670> little<00:00:40.820> bit<00:00:40.969> of<00:00:41.059> tinkering

00:00:41.259 --> 00:00:41.269 
needs to do a little bit of tinkering

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:42.849 
needs to do a little bit of tinkering
now<00:00:41.600> to<00:00:41.660> get<00:00:42.050> the<00:00:42.140> balance<00:00:42.289> quite<00:00:42.649> right

00:00:42.849 --> 00:00:42.859 
now to get the balance quite right

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:44.770 
now to get the balance quite right
between<00:00:43.039> the<00:00:43.609> water<00:00:43.789> coming<00:00:44.390> in<00:00:44.570> and<00:00:44.719> the

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
between the water coming in and the

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.919 
between the water coming in and the
water<00:00:44.929> going<00:00:45.109> out<00:00:45.340> but<00:00:46.340> yeah<00:00:47.059> we<00:00:47.539> see<00:00:47.750> that

00:00:47.919 --> 00:00:47.929 
water going out but yeah we see that

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:50.439 
water going out but yeah we see that
over<00:00:48.399> have<00:00:49.399> licked<00:00:49.609> this<00:00:49.730> from<00:00:49.940> the<00:00:50.030> kitchen

00:00:50.439 --> 00:00:50.449 
over have licked this from the kitchen

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:52.090 
over have licked this from the kitchen
which<00:00:50.690> is<00:00:50.840> now<00:00:50.989> gonna<00:00:51.140> be<00:00:51.230> my<00:00:51.500> little<00:00:51.679> filter

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
which is now gonna be my little filter

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.520 
which is now gonna be my little filter
to<00:00:52.250> catch<00:00:52.399> all<00:00:52.609> the<00:00:52.780> large<00:00:53.780> bits<00:00:54.019> of<00:00:54.170> fish<00:00:54.260> pre

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
to catch all the large bits of fish pre

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:55.779 
to catch all the large bits of fish pre
off<00:00:54.649> it<00:00:54.800> was<00:00:54.920> a<00:00:54.949> good<00:00:55.070> idea<00:00:55.190> because<00:00:55.460> I<00:00:55.579> can

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
off it was a good idea because I can

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.389 
off it was a good idea because I can
literally<00:00:56.000> just<00:00:56.059> pick<00:00:56.390> it<00:00:56.449> up<00:00:56.570> and<00:00:57.280> give<00:00:58.280> it<00:00:58.339> a

00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 
literally just pick it up and give it a

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.739 
literally just pick it up and give it a
clean<00:00:58.839> whack<00:00:59.839> you're<00:00:59.989> back<00:01:00.140> in<00:01:00.289> again<00:01:01.570> so<00:01:02.570> yeah

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:02.749 
clean whack you're back in again so yeah

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:08.130 
clean whack you're back in again so yeah
it's<00:01:05.140> levels<00:01:06.140> here<00:01:06.860> so<00:01:07.130> by<00:01:07.340> the<00:01:07.400> time<00:01:07.579> it<00:01:07.700> gets

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
it's levels here so by the time it gets

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.660 
it's levels here so by the time it gets
roughly<00:01:09.140> two<00:01:09.560> inches<00:01:09.590> underneath<00:01:10.220> that's

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
roughly two inches underneath that's

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.620 
roughly two inches underneath that's
where<00:01:10.970> my<00:01:11.090> bell<00:01:11.270> siphon<00:01:11.479> should<00:01:11.840> activate

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
where my bell siphon should activate

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.960 
where my bell siphon should activate
they<00:01:14.630> look<00:01:14.810> around<00:01:14.930> at<00:01:15.170> my<00:01:15.259> nursery<00:01:15.619> here<00:01:15.970> got

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
they look around at my nursery here got

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.380 
they look around at my nursery here got
some<00:01:17.560> iceberg<00:01:18.560> lettuce<00:01:18.770> is<00:01:19.100> a<00:01:19.369> plant<00:01:20.060> in<00:01:20.149> a<00:01:20.210> few

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:20.390 
some iceberg lettuce is a plant in a few

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.300 
some iceberg lettuce is a plant in a few
weeks<00:01:20.570> ago<00:01:20.720> so<00:01:20.920> I'm<00:01:21.920> going<00:01:22.100> to<00:01:22.159> probably

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
weeks ago so I'm going to probably

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.060 
weeks ago so I'm going to probably
transfer<00:01:22.790> one<00:01:22.970> of<00:01:23.060> these<00:01:23.180> into<00:01:23.659> my<00:01:24.560> grow<00:01:24.770> bed

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
transfer one of these into my grow bed

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.069 
transfer one of these into my grow bed
and<00:01:25.399> I<00:01:25.460> like<00:01:25.610> to<00:01:25.790> see<00:01:26.479> the<00:01:26.600> growth<00:01:26.750> rate

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:27.079 
and I like to see the growth rate

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:29.980 
and I like to see the growth rate
difference<00:01:27.500> between<00:01:27.890> one<00:01:28.579> in<00:01:28.700> saw<00:01:28.939> versus<00:01:29.570> one

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
difference between one in saw versus one

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.789 
difference between one in saw versus one
that's<00:01:30.020> actually<00:01:30.350> in<00:01:30.590> the<00:01:30.969> aquaponic<00:01:31.969> system

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 
that's actually in the aquaponic system

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:35.950 
that's actually in the aquaponic system
I've<00:01:33.799> got<00:01:33.920> some<00:01:34.070> peppers<00:01:34.490> down<00:01:35.119> here<00:01:35.450> actually

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
I've got some peppers down here actually

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.249 
I've got some peppers down here actually
going<00:01:36.110> to<00:01:36.200> be<00:01:36.259> going<00:01:36.439> in<00:01:36.619> as<00:01:36.770> well<00:01:37.119> these<00:01:38.259> 100

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
going to be going in as well these 100

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:40.990 
going to be going in as well these 100
sure<00:01:39.590> what<00:01:39.799> they<00:01:39.890> offer<00:01:40.250> to<00:01:40.310> be<00:01:40.430> perfect<00:01:40.790> I<00:01:40.850> so

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
sure what they offer to be perfect I so

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.279 
sure what they offer to be perfect I so
think<00:01:41.240> they<00:01:41.329> might<00:01:41.509> be<00:01:41.770> chives<00:01:42.770> or<00:01:43.130> some<00:01:43.310> kind

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:44.289 
think they might be chives or some kind

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:47.289 
think they might be chives or some kind
then<00:01:45.289> my<00:01:45.439> little<00:01:45.590> pots<00:01:45.860> here<00:01:46.130> got<00:01:46.340> my<00:01:46.490> cabbages

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
then my little pots here got my cabbages

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:50.319 
then my little pots here got my cabbages
the<00:01:48.170> started<00:01:49.100> germinate<00:01:49.549> in<00:01:49.700> and<00:01:50.030> I've<00:01:50.119> got<00:01:50.149> a

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
ones that aren't doing as fantastic so

00:02:52.790 --> 00:03:07.870 
ones that aren't doing as fantastic so
yeah<00:02:54.040> it's<00:02:55.040> just<00:02:55.130> still<00:02:55.459> taken<00:02:55.819> to<00:02:56.360> fit<00:02:56.540> up<00:03:06.880> the

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
yeah it's just still taken to fit up the

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.100 
yeah it's just still taken to fit up the
overflow<00:03:08.120> pipe<00:03:08.660> which<00:03:09.380> now<00:03:10.780> works<00:03:11.780> a<00:03:11.989> lot

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
overflow pipe which now works a lot

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.020 
overflow pipe which now works a lot
better<00:03:12.380> since<00:03:12.890> increasing<00:03:13.430> it<00:03:13.519> from<00:03:13.549> the

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
better since increasing it from the

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.630 
better since increasing it from the
previous<00:03:14.690> version<00:03:15.380> I<00:03:15.470> had<00:03:15.680> I<00:03:15.709> had<00:03:15.980> an<00:03:16.370> overflow

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640

in about a week's time so much start off
of<00:04:15.290> just<00:04:15.560> a<00:04:15.859> hand<00:04:16.370> for<00:04:16.549> the<00:04:16.609> plants<00:04:17.060> I<00:04:17.900> do<00:04:18.260> have

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
of just a hand for the plants I do have

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.630 
of just a hand for the plants I do have
a<00:04:18.560> cold<00:04:19.220> water<00:04:19.430> fish<00:04:19.729> tank<00:04:20.350> in<00:04:21.350> my<00:04:22.010> indoors<00:04:22.490> at

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.640 
a cold water fish tank in my indoors at

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.399 
a cold water fish tank in my indoors at
the<00:04:22.700> moment<00:04:23.060> so<00:04:23.720> I'm<00:04:23.810> going<00:04:23.930> to<00:04:23.990> clean<00:04:24.169> it<00:04:24.320> out

00:04:24.399 --> 00:04:24.409 
the moment so I'm going to clean it out

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:26.140 
the moment so I'm going to clean it out
later<00:04:24.680> on<00:04:24.770> I<00:04:24.919> think<00:04:25.070> I'll<00:04:25.400> just<00:04:25.550> take<00:04:25.669> out<00:04:25.970> all

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
later on I think I'll just take out all

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.590 
later on I think I'll just take out all
the

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
the

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.230 
the
the<00:04:26.960> fish<00:04:27.140> poo<00:04:27.410> and<00:04:27.590> that<00:04:27.710> lot<00:04:27.890> and<00:04:27.920> the<00:04:28.240> water

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
the fish poo and that lot and the water

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.210 
the fish poo and that lot and the water
from<00:04:29.540> that<00:04:29.660> tank<00:04:29.990> when<00:04:30.140> I<00:04:30.170> clean<00:04:30.440> it<00:04:30.620> and<00:04:30.830> put

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 
from that tank when I clean it and put

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:32.950 
from that tank when I clean it and put
it<00:04:31.280> into<00:04:31.460> this<00:04:31.580> system<00:04:31.820> so<00:04:32.270> at<00:04:32.390> least<00:04:32.570> I've<00:04:32.900> got

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
it into this system so at least I've got

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.110 
it into this system so at least I've got
a<00:04:33.110> little<00:04:33.230> bit<00:04:33.470> of<00:04:33.530> a<00:04:33.760> ammonia<00:04:34.760> and<00:04:34.880> some<00:04:35.030> of

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
a little bit of a ammonia and some of

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.730 
a little bit of a ammonia and some of
the<00:04:35.210> natural<00:04:35.540> bacteria<00:04:35.720> for<00:04:36.230> my<00:04:36.350> fish<00:04:36.530> tank

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
the natural bacteria for my fish tank

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.160 
the natural bacteria for my fish tank
that's<00:04:36.950> already<00:04:37.100> established<00:04:37.960> I'm<00:04:38.960> going<00:04:39.110> to

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.170 
that's already established I'm going to

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:43.540 
that's already established I'm going to
put<00:04:39.290> some<00:04:39.470> of<00:04:39.500> the<00:04:41.950> comments<00:04:42.950> that's<00:04:43.070> cool<00:04:43.370> but

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
put some of the comments that's cool but

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.160 
put some of the comments that's cool but
they're<00:04:43.790> the<00:04:44.150> treatment<00:04:44.630> to<00:04:44.780> put<00:04:44.900> into<00:04:45.020> the

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.170 
they're the treatment to put into the

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:46.660 
they're the treatment to put into the
water<00:04:45.290> to<00:04:45.500> get<00:04:45.620> rid<00:04:45.680> of<00:04:45.860> the<00:04:45.920> chlorine<00:04:46.130> as<00:04:46.460> well

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:46.670 
water to get rid of the chlorine as well

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:48.280 
water to get rid of the chlorine as well
so<00:04:46.850> I'm<00:04:46.970> gonna<00:04:47.060> do<00:04:47.270> that<00:04:47.300> after<00:04:47.810> than<00:04:48.170> this

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
so I'm gonna do that after than this

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.610 
so I'm gonna do that after than this
video<00:04:48.560> and<00:04:49.660> yeah<00:04:50.660> probably<00:04:50.870> that<00:04:51.020> that<00:04:51.110> cycle

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
video and yeah probably that that cycle

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.550 
video and yeah probably that that cycle
maybe<00:04:51.770> for<00:04:52.160> a<00:04:52.460> couple<00:04:53.060> of<00:04:53.120> days<00:04:53.330> before<00:04:54.320> I

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
maybe for a couple of days before I

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.550 
maybe for a couple of days before I
stick<00:04:54.800> any<00:04:54.980> plants<00:04:55.340> in<00:04:55.520> and<00:04:55.760> then<00:04:56.450> I<00:04:56.810> think

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:57.560 
stick any plants in and then I think

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.160 
stick any plants in and then I think
caustics<00:04:57.920> and<00:04:58.010> plants<00:04:58.400> in<00:04:58.550> so<00:04:59.270> our<00:04:59.780> sticks<00:05:00.050> of

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:00.170 
caustics and plants in so our sticks of

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.440 
caustics and plants in so our sticks of
the<00:05:00.230> fish<00:05:00.410> in<00:05:00.590> maybe<00:05:01.100> within<00:05:01.790> about<00:05:01.940> a<00:05:02.090> week<00:05:02.240> or

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
the fish in maybe within about a week or

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.190 
the fish in maybe within about a week or
so<00:05:02.630> so<00:05:03.820> yeah<00:05:04.820> I'm<00:05:05.180> not<00:05:05.240> still<00:05:05.720> a<00:05:05.750> bit<00:05:05.960> undecided

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
so so yeah I'm not still a bit undecided

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.500 
so so yeah I'm not still a bit undecided
really<00:05:06.830> on<00:05:06.920> what<00:05:07.040> sort<00:05:07.280> of<00:05:07.310> fish<00:05:08.030> to<00:05:08.210> put<00:05:08.360> and<00:05:08.480> I

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:08.510 
really on what sort of fish to put and I

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.360 
really on what sort of fish to put and I
think<00:05:08.690> we're<00:05:08.870> going<00:05:08.960> to<00:05:09.020> go<00:05:09.140> for<00:05:09.440> standard

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
think we're going to go for standard

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.450 
think we're going to go for standard
golf<00:05:10.760> fish<00:05:11.090> for<00:05:11.600> the<00:05:11.690> minute<00:05:12.070> but<00:05:13.070> I'd<00:05:13.220> say

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
golf fish for the minute but I'd say

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.160 
golf fish for the minute but I'd say
I've<00:05:13.580> got<00:05:13.700> the<00:05:13.790> clear<00:05:14.000> tub<00:05:14.330> so<00:05:14.540> I<00:05:14.570> should<00:05:14.870> start

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.170 
I've got the clear tub so I should start

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.050 
I've got the clear tub so I should start
getting<00:05:15.290> a<00:05:15.410> bit<00:05:15.560> of<00:05:15.590> a<00:05:15.800> buildup<00:05:16.190> of<00:05:16.310> algae<00:05:16.700> so

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
getting a bit of a buildup of algae so

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.230 
getting a bit of a buildup of algae so
maybe<00:05:17.630> I'll<00:05:17.840> get<00:05:17.960> a<00:05:18.020> few<00:05:18.080> algae<00:05:18.590> is<00:05:18.800> as<00:05:18.980> well

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
maybe I'll get a few algae is as well

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.490 
maybe I'll get a few algae is as well
maybe<00:05:20.240> change<00:05:20.540> it<00:05:20.660> over<00:05:20.870> completely<00:05:21.200> to<00:05:21.290> our

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 
maybe change it over completely to our

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.390 
maybe change it over completely to our
bees<00:05:21.860> eventually<00:05:22.370> so<00:05:23.120> let's<00:05:23.750> see<00:05:23.960> now

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 
bees eventually so let's see now

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:47.710 
bees eventually so let's see now
is<00:05:25.400> there<00:05:25.610> enough<00:05:25.850> flow<00:05:26.150> coming<00:05:26.570> in<00:05:43.840> like<00:05:46.720> low

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720 
is there enough flow coming in like low

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.170 
is there enough flow coming in like low
coming<00:05:48.140> in<00:05:48.490> what's<00:05:49.490> going<00:05:49.820> down<00:05:49.880> the

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
coming in what's going down the

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.300 
coming in what's going down the
standpipe<00:05:50.690> at<00:05:50.900> the<00:05:50.960> moment<00:05:51.290> so<00:05:51.950> this<00:05:52.070> might

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.310 
standpipe at the moment so this might

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:57.790 
standpipe at the moment so this might
need<00:05:52.490> a<00:05:52.520> little<00:05:52.700> bit<00:05:52.880> a<00:05:55.600> few<00:05:56.600> more<00:05:56.750> seconds<00:05:57.230> the

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
need a little bit a few more seconds the

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:14.580 
need a little bit a few more seconds the
suitcases

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:14.590 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:17.950 

we<00:06:15.590> kicked<00:06:15.800> in<00:06:16.010> by<00:06:16.160> now<00:06:16.190> so<00:06:16.640> just<00:06:17.540> take<00:06:17.840> the

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:17.960 
we kicked in by now so just take the

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:25.200 
we kicked in by now so just take the
flow<00:06:18.200> rate<00:06:18.380> up<00:06:18.530> slightly<00:06:18.890> on<00:06:19.070> pump

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:25.210 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.700 

thanks<00:06:26.210> to<00:06:26.300> the<00:06:26.420> are<00:06:26.510> fine<00:06:26.810> tuning<00:06:27.110> part<00:06:27.500> now

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:27.710 
thanks to the are fine tuning part now

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.640 
thanks to the are fine tuning part now
just<00:06:28.660> adjusting<00:06:29.660> the<00:06:29.690> side<00:06:29.990> for<00:06:30.200> them<00:06:30.320> to<00:06:30.440> flow

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:30.650 
just adjusting the side for them to flow

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:32.830 
just adjusting the side for them to flow
rate<00:06:30.920> to<00:06:31.070> make<00:06:31.220> sure<00:06:31.460> that<00:06:31.760> the<00:06:32.450> girls<00:06:32.660> side

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:32.840 
rate to make sure that the girls side

00:06:32.840 --> 00:07:11.440 
rate to make sure that the girls side
for<00:06:33.080> nectar<00:06:33.350> weights<00:06:33.500> every<00:06:33.740> time

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:11.450 

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:13.550 

the<00:07:12.450> morale<00:07:12.750> they<00:07:12.840> still<00:07:13.140> seem<00:07:13.380> to<00:07:13.500> be

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:13.560 
the morale they still seem to be

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:29.840 
the morale they still seem to be
matching<00:07:13.800> each<00:07:14.010> other<00:07:14.280> so<00:07:28.220> okay<00:07:29.220> clearly<00:07:29.670> it

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:29.850 
matching each other so okay clearly it

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:31.220 
matching each other so okay clearly it
looks<00:07:30.030> like<00:07:30.180> I've<00:07:30.360> got<00:07:30.390> some<00:07:30.510> tinkering<00:07:31.110> that

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:31.230 
looks like I've got some tinkering that

00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:33.250 
looks like I've got some tinkering that
I<00:07:31.260> need<00:07:31.440> to<00:07:31.560> do<00:07:31.710> on<00:07:31.830> this<00:07:31.980> because<00:07:32.190> they're<00:07:32.610> not

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:33.260 
I need to do on this because they're not

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:35.420 
I need to do on this because they're not
quite<00:07:34.260> a<00:07:34.290> lot<00:07:34.410> flow<00:07:34.680> rate<00:07:34.920> in<00:07:35.010> there<00:07:35.160> which<00:07:35.310> I

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:35.430 
quite a lot flow rate in there which I

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:37.940 
quite a lot flow rate in there which I
don't<00:07:35.670> think<00:07:36.000> would<00:07:36.930> be<00:07:37.110> enough<00:07:37.350> also<00:07:37.650> I<00:07:37.860> think

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:37.950 
don't think would be enough also I think

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:39.740 
don't think would be enough also I think
there's<00:07:38.250> too<00:07:38.400> much<00:07:38.550> going<00:07:38.910> in<00:07:39.060> so<00:07:39.390> thus<00:07:39.540> life

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:39.750 
there's too much going in so thus life

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:41.210 
there's too much going in so thus life
and<00:07:39.990> won't<00:07:40.170> break<00:07:40.470> when<00:07:40.800> it<00:07:40.890> gets<00:07:41.040> to<00:07:41.130> the

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:41.220 
and won't break when it gets to the

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:44.900 
and won't break when it gets to the
bottom<00:07:41.540> and<00:07:42.540> this<00:07:43.260> doesn't<00:07:43.530> seem<00:07:43.800> out<00:07:44.520> as<00:07:44.640> much

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:44.910 
bottom and this doesn't seem out as much

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:50.150 
bottom and this doesn't seem out as much
as<00:07:45.090> I'd<00:07:45.210> like<00:07:45.420> so<00:07:46.670> after<00:07:47.670> do<00:07:47.760> some<00:07:47.970> tinkering
