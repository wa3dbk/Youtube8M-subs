turning<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.629> lot<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:54.899> heads<00:00:55.050> is<00:00:55.260> our<00:00:55.559> USB<00:00:55.829> dock

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
turning a lot of heads is our USB dock

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.130 
turning a lot of heads is our USB dock
this<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:57.059> again<00:00:57.300> something<00:00:57.480> that<00:00:57.690> nobody<00:00:58.109> else

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
this is again something that nobody else

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.229 
this is again something that nobody else
has<00:00:58.379> done<00:00:58.500> in<00:00:58.739> this<00:00:58.859> industry<00:00:59.100> what<00:00:59.969> you<00:01:00.090> can

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
has done in this industry what you can

has done in this industry what you can
do<00:01:00.359> with<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.570> USB<00:01:00.780> dock<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.530> change<00:01:02.539> you<00:01:03.539> can

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
do with the USB dock is change you can

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.240 
do with the USB dock is change you can
update<00:01:03.809> your<00:01:03.989> firmware<00:01:04.170> in<00:01:04.470> your<00:01:04.589> lens<00:01:04.799> you

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
update your firmware in your lens you

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.490 
update your firmware in your lens you
can<00:01:05.280> do<00:01:05.489> micro<00:01:05.820> autofocus<00:01:06.390> adjustments<00:01:06.990> which

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
can do micro autofocus adjustments which

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.289 
can do micro autofocus adjustments which
unlike<00:01:07.979> what<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.460> can<00:01:08.580> do<00:01:08.670> in<00:01:08.790> your<00:01:08.820> camera

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
unlike what you can do in your camera

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.690 
unlike what you can do in your camera
this<00:01:10.080> allows<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.590> actually<00:01:10.740> might<00:01:11.430> grow

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
this allows you to actually might grow

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.670 
this allows you to actually might grow
autofocus<00:01:12.659> adjusted<00:01:13.110> different<00:01:13.380> focus

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
autofocus adjusted different focus

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.770
