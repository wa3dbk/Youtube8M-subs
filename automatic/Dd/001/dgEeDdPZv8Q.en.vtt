make sure you allow your curl to cool

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.020 
make sure you allow your curl to cool
completely<00:01:28.320> before<00:01:28.770> you<00:01:29.280> manipulate<00:01:29.880> your

completely before you manipulate your
hair<00:01:30.329> let's<00:01:31.229> try<00:01:31.500> this<00:01:31.560> one<00:01:31.860> more<00:01:31.920> time<00:01:32.360> take<00:01:33.360> a

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
hair let's try this one more time take a

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.690 
hair let's try this one more time take a
small<00:01:33.780> section<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.320> hair<00:01:34.380> not<00:01:35.070> wider<00:01:35.340> than<00:01:35.549> the

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
small section of hair not wider than the

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.730 
small section of hair not wider than the
plates<00:01:35.939> of<00:01:36.119> your<00:01:36.270> flat<00:01:36.479> iron<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.900> then<00:01:37.500> comb

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.600 
through it gently to remove any tangles
now<00:01:41.520> we'll<00:01:41.790> apply<00:01:42.030> a<00:01:42.119> little<00:01:42.390> bit<00:01:42.600> of<00:01:42.630> syrup

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
now we'll apply a little bit of syrup

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.830 
now we'll apply a little bit of syrup
applying<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:44.820> from<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.210> roots<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.630> ends

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
applying it from the roots to the ends
