tell you why right now at the bottom

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.889 
tell you why right now at the bottom
part<00:00:44.550> of<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.879> movement<00:00:45.090> right<00:00:45.420> here<00:00:45.660> there's

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
part of the movement right here there's

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.229 
part of the movement right here there's
tension<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.950> tension<00:00:47.399> is<00:00:47.520> there<00:00:47.730> right

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
tension the tension is there right

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.180 
tension the tension is there right
through<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.840> movement<00:00:49.260> with<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.739> dumbbell

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
through the movement with the dumbbell

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.979 
through the movement with the dumbbell
you<00:00:50.579> get<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.789> lot<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.090> tension<00:00:51.300> at<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.809> top

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
you get a lot of tension at the top

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.020 
you get a lot of tension at the top
right<00:00:52.379> there<00:00:52.590> but<00:00:53.399> at<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.610> bottom<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:53.969> the

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
right there but at the bottom of the

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.459 
right there but at the bottom of the
movement<00:00:54.360> there's<00:00:54.570> not<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.960> lot<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.260> tension

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
movement there's not a lot of tension

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.959 
movement there's not a lot of tension
with<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.770> dumbbell<00:00:56.129> however<00:00:56.520> with<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.730> cable

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
with the dumbbell however with a cable

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.970 
with the dumbbell however with a cable
there<00:00:57.300> is<00:00:57.480> because<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.440> resistance<00:00:58.710> is

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
there is because the resistance is

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.010 
there is because the resistance is
pulling<00:00:59.309> straight<00:00:59.609> across<00:00:59.879> you're<00:01:00.600> not<00:01:00.780> just

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
pulling straight across you're not just

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.779 
pulling straight across you're not just
working<00:01:01.199> against<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.800> gravity<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.399> a

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
working against the gravity of a

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.910 
working against the gravity of a
dumbbell<00:01:03.210> so<00:01:03.719> we<00:01:03.809> have<00:01:03.960> constant<00:01:04.199> tension<00:01:04.650> on

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
dumbbell so we have constant tension on

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.640 
dumbbell so we have constant tension on
the<00:01:05.070> rear<00:01:05.250> delt<00:01:05.519> by<00:01:06.060> using<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.659> cable<00:01:07.110> so

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
the rear delt by using the cable so

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.830 
the rear delt by using the cable so
those<00:01:07.860> folks<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.369> have<00:01:08.670> trouble<00:01:08.970> activating
