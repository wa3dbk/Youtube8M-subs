possible and I'm gonna move and do this

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.160 
possible and I'm gonna move and do this
over<00:01:49.979> my<00:01:50.369> pot<00:01:50.640> here<00:01:53.000> and<00:01:54.000> this<00:01:54.330> orange<00:01:54.599> zest

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
over my pot here and this orange zest

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.990 
over my pot here and this orange zest
it's<00:01:55.349> where<00:01:55.530> all<00:01:55.739> the<00:01:55.860> flavor<00:01:56.069> is<00:01:56.280> the

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
it's where all the flavor is the

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.020 
it's where all the flavor is the
essential<00:01:57.509> oils<00:01:57.979> from<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.160> orange<00:01:59.610> are<00:01:59.819> in

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
essential oils from the orange are in

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.359 
essential oils from the orange are in
the<00:02:00.209> zest<00:02:00.509> of<00:02:01.289> course<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.619> juice<00:02:01.890> has<00:02:02.099> flavor

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
the zest of course the juice has flavor

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.150 
the zest of course the juice has flavor
too<00:02:02.670> but<00:02:02.849> not<00:02:03.090> as<00:02:03.330> much<00:02:03.539> as<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.560> zest<00:02:04.860> so<00:02:05.069> we

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
too but not as much as the zest so we

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.249 
too but not as much as the zest so we
don't<00:02:05.369> want<00:02:05.550> to<00:02:05.640> waste<00:02:05.819> it

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.580 

so<00:02:10.259> we'll<00:02:10.440> get<00:02:10.590> most<00:02:10.830> of<00:02:11.870> this<00:02:12.870> is<00:02:13.080> s<00:02:13.260> and<00:02:13.500> it

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
so we'll get most of this is s and it

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.900 
so we'll get most of this is s and it
kind<00:02:13.770> of<00:02:13.830> hides<00:02:14.070> in<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.430> back<00:02:14.610> of<00:02:14.790> the

kind of hides in the back of the

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:26.060 
kind of hides in the back of the
microplane<00:02:20.030> then<00:02:21.030> I'll<00:02:21.150> do<00:02:21.300> the<00:02:21.420> other<00:02:21.540> one

they're<00:03:35.470> loaded<00:03:35.739> with<00:03:35.769> pectin<00:03:36.340> so<00:03:36.549> when<00:03:36.700> you

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
they're loaded with pectin so when you

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.000 
they're loaded with pectin so when you
cook<00:03:37.060> this<00:03:37.269> it'll<00:03:37.930> cook<00:03:38.110> about<00:03:38.320> an<00:03:38.440> hour<00:03:38.680> it

all<00:03:39.160> break<00:03:39.489> down<00:03:39.760> and<00:03:40.060> then<00:03:40.420> when<00:03:40.540> you<00:03:40.660> cool<00:03:40.900> it

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
all break down and then when you cool it

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.110 
all break down and then when you cool it
off<00:03:41.200> the<00:03:41.410> pectin<00:03:41.890> is<00:03:42.010> what<00:03:42.160> will<00:03:42.310> make<00:03:42.459> it<00:03:42.640> gel

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
off the pectin is what will make it gel

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.539 
off the pectin is what will make it gel
a<00:03:43.150> little<00:03:43.480> bit<00:03:43.630> so<00:03:44.380> cover<00:03:44.709> goes<00:03:44.950> on<00:03:45.190> on<00:03:45.489> the

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
a little bit so cover goes on on the

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:47.340 
a little bit so cover goes on on the
stove<00:03:46.120> I'll<00:03:46.570> show<00:03:46.780> you<00:03:46.870> what<00:03:46.989> it<00:03:47.049> looks<00:03:47.230> like

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
sheet pan and I laid it out like this so

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:13.300 
sheet pan and I laid it out like this so
it<00:04:11.359> would<00:04:11.510> cool<00:04:11.720> quicker<00:04:12.230> I<00:04:12.500> also<00:04:12.859> put<00:04:13.189> it<00:04:13.280> in

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
it would cool quicker I also put it in

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.399 
it would cool quicker I also put it in
the<00:04:13.430> refrigerator<00:04:13.970> and<00:04:14.209> you<00:04:14.689> can<00:04:14.870> see<00:04:15.140> the

the refrigerator and you can see the

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:17.560 
the refrigerator and you can see the
effect<00:04:15.799> that<00:04:15.890> the<00:04:16.100> pectin<00:04:16.519> has<00:04:16.759> it's<00:04:17.419> very

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
effect that the pectin has it's very

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.379 
effect that the pectin has it's very
almost<00:04:18.410> jelly<00:04:18.949> like<00:04:19.190> like<00:04:19.459> that<00:04:19.639> nasty<00:04:20.090> canned
