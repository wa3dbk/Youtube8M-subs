00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
your battery life and I found this to be

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.460 
your battery life and I found this to be
pretty<00:00:17.369> accurate<00:00:17.550> I<00:00:17.940> actually<00:00:18.600> got<00:00:18.900> about<00:00:19.140> one

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
pretty accurate I actually got about one

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.920 
pretty accurate I actually got about one
and<00:00:19.650> a<00:00:19.740> half<00:00:19.770> charges<00:00:20.609> out<00:00:20.760> of<00:00:20.880> it<00:00:21.029> but<00:00:21.660> still

and a half charges out of it but still

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.370 
and a half charges out of it but still
that's<00:00:22.199> pretty<00:00:22.410> good<00:00:26.960> so<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.109> way<00:00:28.230> it<00:00:28.260> works

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:01.070 
slide the top over the case you charge

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.660 
slide the top over the case you charge
it<00:01:01.160> using<00:01:01.489> a<00:01:01.550> micro<00:01:01.910> USB<00:01:02.120> port<00:01:03.250> it<00:01:04.250> also<00:01:04.400> comes

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
it using a micro USB port it also comes

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:12.490 
it using a micro USB port it also comes
in<00:01:04.850> yellow<00:01:05.210> pink<00:01:05.570> blue<00:01:06.050> red<00:01:06.500> purple<00:01:06.890> and<00:01:07.190> white

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.630 

obviously<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.619> does<00:01:13.740> add<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:13.920> lot<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.189> bulk<00:01:14.429> and

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
obviously it does add a lot of bulk and

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.609 
obviously it does add a lot of bulk and
I<00:01:14.820> found<00:01:15.000> it<00:01:15.149> to<00:01:15.329> be<00:01:15.359> a<00:01:15.659> reasonable<00:01:16.200> sacrifice

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
I found it to be a reasonable sacrifice

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.440 
I found it to be a reasonable sacrifice

easily<00:02:08.489> removable<00:02:09.000> this<00:02:09.269> is<00:02:09.450> not<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.690> biggest

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
easily removable this is not the biggest

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:16.160

problem<00:02:13.730> it<00:02:14.730> also<00:02:14.879> has<00:02:15.060> a<00:02:15.090> lay<00:02:15.269> flat<00:02:15.510> design<00:02:15.840> so

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
problem it also has a lay flat design so

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.420 
problem it also has a lay flat design so
you<00:02:16.260> can<00:02:16.380> put<00:02:16.500> it<00:02:16.590> on<00:02:16.680> a<00:02:16.709> surface<00:02:16.920> and<00:02:17.310> not

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
you can put it on a surface and not

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.900 
you can put it on a surface and not
worry<00:02:17.609> about<00:02:17.639> your<00:02:17.790> screen<00:02:18.090> giving<00:02:18.239> scratch

feedback<00:02:24.380> so<00:02:25.380> now<00:02:25.500> that<00:02:25.650> I<00:02:25.709> talked<00:02:25.889> about<00:02:25.980> all

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
feedback so now that I talked about all

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.500

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
first is the bulb like I said before

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.580 
first is the bulb like I said before
it's<00:02:30.060> a<00:02:30.209> sacrifice<00:02:30.540> that<00:02:30.690> seems<00:02:31.049> worth<00:02:31.260> it<00:02:31.410> but

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
it's a sacrifice that seems worth it but

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.849 
it's a sacrifice that seems worth it but
is<00:02:31.709> really<00:02:31.859> big<00:02:32.630> second<00:02:33.630> is<00:02:33.720> a<00:02:33.750> micro<00:02:34.139> USB<00:02:34.170> port

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:34.859 
is really big second is a micro USB port

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:36.830 
is really big second is a micro USB port
I<00:02:35.040> have<00:02:35.609> a<00:02:35.670> plethora<00:02:35.880> 30<00:02:36.269> pin<00:02:36.450> connectors

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840
