blade to do that with I'm going to angle

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.290 
blade to do that with I'm going to angle
my<00:01:15.890> knife<00:01:16.220> down<00:01:16.460> instead<00:01:16.820> of<00:01:16.880> going<00:01:16.970> straight

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:17.300 
my knife down instead of going straight

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.330 
my knife down instead of going straight
down<00:01:17.420> and<00:01:18.200> we'll<00:01:18.350> kind<00:01:18.560> of<00:01:18.649> angle<00:01:19.130> it<00:01:19.160> like

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
down and we'll kind of angle it like

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.109 
down and we'll kind of angle it like
that<00:01:19.750> just<00:01:20.750> make<00:01:20.930> a<00:01:20.960> few<00:01:21.200> extra<00:01:21.350> to<00:01:21.939> go<00:01:22.939> with<00:01:23.090> a

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
that just make a few extra to go with a

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.109 
that just make a few extra to go with a
stop<00:01:23.420> cut<00:01:23.720> in<00:01:23.900> here<00:01:24.140> up<00:01:24.590> to<00:01:24.860> here<00:01:25.130> and<00:01:25.159> here<00:01:25.610> and

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
stop cut in here up to here and here and

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:27.310 
stop cut in here up to here and here and
on<00:01:26.270> around<00:01:26.630> it<00:01:26.840> and<00:01:26.900> then<00:01:27.049> we're<00:01:27.140> going<00:01:27.229> to

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
on around it and then we're going to

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:40.020 
on around it and then we're going to
start<00:01:27.500> removing<00:01:27.770> that<00:01:28.040> extra<00:01:28.100> wood<00:01:28.700> there

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.390 

a<00:01:40.290> couple<00:01:41.290> of<00:01:41.380> swaps<00:01:41.650> I'll<00:01:41.890> just<00:01:42.010> go<00:01:42.130> ahead<00:01:42.220> and

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
a couple of swaps I'll just go ahead and

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:54.950 
a couple of swaps I'll just go ahead and
do<00:01:42.460> the<00:01:42.580> other<00:01:42.610> side<00:01:42.820> here<00:01:43.299> Willimantic

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.750 

now<00:01:55.530> we<00:01:55.590> can<00:01:55.770> go<00:01:55.860> ahead<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.010> start<00:01:56.250> taking<00:01:56.640> off

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
now we can go ahead and start taking off

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.370 
now we can go ahead and start taking off
it<00:01:56.940> I<00:01:57.000> usually<00:01:57.180> take<00:01:57.450> off<00:01:57.660> the<00:01:57.810> corner<00:01:58.170> first

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
it I usually take off the corner first

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.650 
it I usually take off the corner first
and<00:01:58.740> this<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.190> then<00:02:01.550> go<00:02:02.550> in<00:02:02.760> around<00:02:02.880> closer<00:02:03.420> to

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
and this and then go in around closer to

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.860 
and this and then go in around closer to
the<00:02:03.750> arm<00:02:05.120> you<00:02:06.120> can<00:02:06.240> just<00:02:06.450> roll<00:02:06.630> that<00:02:06.810> right

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
the arm you can just roll that right

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:13.010 
the arm you can just roll that right
into<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.590> underneath<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.429> connect<00:02:09.000> there<00:02:12.020> we

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
into the underneath to connect there we

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.690 
into the underneath to connect there we
got<00:02:13.200> that<00:02:13.380> one<00:02:13.560> arm<00:02:13.770> laid<00:02:14.010> out<00:02:14.250> with<00:02:14.430> a<00:02:14.459> knot

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
got that one arm laid out with a knot

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.850 
got that one arm laid out with a knot
but<00:02:15.000> I<00:02:15.300> want<00:02:15.630> to<00:02:15.690> show<00:02:15.840> you<00:02:15.900> another<00:02:16.110> method<00:02:16.590> of

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
but I want to show you another method of

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.730 
but I want to show you another method of
doing<00:02:17.010> this<00:02:17.270> if<00:02:18.270> you<00:02:18.450> add<00:02:18.660> one<00:02:18.930> more<00:02:19.140> tool<00:02:19.470> to

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
doing this if you add one more tool to

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.260 
doing this if you add one more tool to
your<00:02:19.860> collection<00:02:20.520> a<00:02:21.150> large<00:02:21.810> v2<00:02:22.440> you<00:02:23.160> could<00:02:23.370> do

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
your collection a large v2 you could do

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.150 
your collection a large v2 you could do
this<00:02:24.480> type<00:02:25.020> stuff<00:02:25.350> here<00:02:25.530> on<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.800> orange<00:02:26.100> a

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
this type stuff here on the orange a

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.260 
this type stuff here on the orange a
whole<00:02:26.310> lot<00:02:26.490> faster<00:02:28.040> this<00:02:29.040> v2<00:02:29.310> is<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:29.760> pretty

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
whole lot faster this v2 is a pretty

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.650 
whole lot faster this v2 is a pretty
large<00:02:30.510> v2<00:02:31.140> and<00:02:31.489> I<00:02:32.489> think<00:02:32.970> it's<00:02:33.090> like<00:02:33.209> a<00:02:33.239> 90

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
large v2 and I think it's like a 90

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.470 
large v2 and I think it's like a 90
degree<00:02:34.020> I<00:02:34.739> will<00:02:35.310> be<00:02:35.459> laying<00:02:35.640> it<00:02:35.880> on<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.209> side

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
degree I will be laying it on the side

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.690 
degree I will be laying it on the side
what<00:02:37.410> we're<00:02:37.530> going<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.709> do<00:02:37.860> basically<00:02:38.280> just<00:02:38.580> go

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
what we're going to do basically just go

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.370 
what we're going to do basically just go
down<00:02:38.880> through<00:02:39.150> here<00:02:39.300> and<00:02:39.450> outline<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:39.930> arm

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
down through here and outline the arm

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.380 
down through here and outline the arm
and<00:02:40.680> then<00:02:40.770> I'll<00:02:40.890> lay<00:02:41.070> the<00:02:41.280> v2<00:02:41.610> on<00:02:41.820> its<00:02:42.000> side<00:02:42.209> to

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
and then I'll lay the v2 on its side to

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.000 
and then I'll lay the v2 on its side to
remove<00:02:42.630> the<00:02:42.690> heavy<00:02:43.020> stock<00:02:43.440> it's<00:02:43.800> just<00:02:43.950> a

remove the heavy stock it's just a
little<00:02:44.220> bit<00:02:44.340> faster<00:02:44.790> way<00:02:44.910> of<00:02:44.940> doing<00:02:45.090> that

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.069 

now<00:03:00.549> we<00:03:00.610> got<00:03:00.819> to<00:03:00.939> try<00:03:01.090> to<00:03:01.120> come<00:03:01.390> straight<00:03:01.870> in

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
now we got to try to come straight in

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:06.960 
now we got to try to come straight in
here<00:03:04.530> and<00:03:05.530> just<00:03:06.069> give<00:03:06.250> that<00:03:06.430> blade<00:03:06.640> just<00:03:06.849> a

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
here and just give that blade just a

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.339 
here and just give that blade just a
little<00:03:07.209> bit<00:03:07.329> of<00:03:07.420> a<00:03:07.510> curl<00:03:08.319> to<00:03:09.629> to<00:03:10.629> chip<00:03:10.930> to<00:03:11.109> fly

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
little bit of a curl to to chip to fly

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:31.550 
little bit of a curl to to chip to fly
out<00:03:11.530> there

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:34.020 

kind<00:03:32.560> of<00:03:32.620> get<00:03:32.770> those<00:03:32.920> little<00:03:33.250> chips<00:03:33.520> and<00:03:33.820> stuff

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
kind of get those little chips and stuff

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.000 
kind of get those little chips and stuff
cleaned<00:03:34.390> up<00:03:34.600> so<00:03:34.840> when<00:03:35.020> we<00:03:35.140> draw<00:03:35.320> on<00:03:35.620> air<00:03:35.830> that

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
cleaned up so when we draw on air that

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.570 
cleaned up so when we draw on air that
we<00:03:36.130> can<00:03:36.280> get<00:03:36.430> a<00:03:36.460> good<00:03:36.700> smooth<00:03:37.120> pencil<00:03:37.600> I<00:03:38.580> think

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
we can get a good smooth pencil I think

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.310 
we can get a good smooth pencil I think
