keyhole method goes like this
firstly<00:00:35.850> softy<00:00:36.329> cross<00:00:37.520> then<00:00:38.520> you<00:00:38.820> solve<00:00:39.059> three

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
firstly softy cross then you solve three

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.930 
firstly softy cross then you solve three
corners<00:00:39.840> in<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.110> bottom<00:00:40.379> layer<00:00:43.489> then<00:00:44.489> using

corners in the bottom layer then using

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.760 
corners in the bottom layer then using
this<00:00:45.059> remaining<00:00:45.450> empty<00:00:45.750> slot<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.590> move

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
this remaining empty slot you move

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.540 
this remaining empty slot you move
around<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.340> insert<00:00:47.640> these<00:00:47.820> three<00:00:48.180> edges<00:00:49.550> see

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
around to insert these three edges see

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:58.490 
around to insert these three edges see
there<00:00:56.360> you<00:00:57.360> are<00:00:57.449> then<00:00:57.629> left<00:00:57.870> with<00:00:58.020> one<00:00:58.230> empty

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
there you are then left with one empty

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.020 
there you are then left with one empty
slot<00:00:58.739> which<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:59.070> solved<00:00:59.399> with<00:00:59.520> normal<00:00:59.879> fur

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030

trick<00:01:00.210> apt<00:01:00.390> well<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:01.100> variation<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.160> this<00:01:02.309> is<00:01:02.370> to

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
trick apt well a variation of this is to

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.170 
trick apt well a variation of this is to
solve<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.000> cross<00:01:03.239> then<00:01:03.719> three<00:01:04.140> edges<00:01:05.180> like

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
solve the cross then three edges like

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.320 
solve the cross then three edges like
this<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:07.100> then<00:01:08.100> using<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:08.610> remaining<00:01:08.939> empty

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
this and then using this remaining empty

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.530 
this and then using this remaining empty
slot<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:09.960> insert<00:01:10.320> these<00:01:10.470> three<00:01:10.890> corners<00:01:11.540> like

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
slot you insert these three corners like

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:22.070 
slot you insert these three corners like
this<00:01:20.030> but<00:01:21.030> how<00:01:21.240> can<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:21.479> use<00:01:21.630> this<00:01:21.780> during

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
this but how can you use this during

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.109 
this but how can you use this during
your<00:01:22.170> solves<00:01:22.710> while<00:01:23.369> solving<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.759> first<00:01:23.909> few

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
layers as you normally would you may run

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.740 
layers as you normally would you may run
into<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.310> case<00:01:26.490> in<00:01:26.700> which<00:01:26.759> there's<00:01:27.180> an<00:01:27.330> unsolved

empty slot to solve the pair's you would

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.160

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
with the keyhole method for example here

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.170 
with the keyhole method for example here
I<00:01:40.200> move<00:01:40.560> this<00:01:40.710> bottom<00:01:41.040> layer<00:01:41.130> over<00:01:41.610> then

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
I move this bottom layer over then

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.660 
I move this bottom layer over then
insert<00:01:42.570> this<00:01:42.750> here<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.920> move<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.189> back<00:01:44.250> over

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
insert this here and move it back over

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.550 
insert this here and move it back over
and<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:45.149> have<00:01:45.270> this<00:01:45.420> pair<00:01:45.630> solved<00:01:46.140> in<00:01:46.439> this

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
and I have this pair solved in this

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.380 
and I have this pair solved in this
situation<00:01:47.220> we'd<00:01:47.369> have<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.700> move<00:01:47.850> this<00:01:48.149> over

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
situation we'd have to move this over

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.740 
situation we'd have to move this over
here<00:01:48.810> so<00:01:48.869> we<00:01:49.140> have<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.590> do<00:01:49.740> ad<00:01:50.250> 2<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.790> then<00:01:51.600> we

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
here so we have to do ad 2 and then we

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.170 
here so we have to do ad 2 and then we
can<00:01:51.899> insert<00:01:52.200> this<00:01:52.409> just<00:01:53.009> like<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.970> move

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
can insert this just like that and move

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.120 
can insert this just like that and move
this<00:01:54.329> back<00:01:54.540> over<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.200> we<00:01:55.380> have<00:01:55.470> this<00:01:55.619> solved

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
this back over and we have this solved

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.100 
this back over and we have this solved
as<00:01:56.340> another<00:01:56.850> example<00:01:57.420> here<00:01:57.719> we<00:01:57.840> have<00:01:57.869> this

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
as another example here we have this

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.600 
as another example here we have this
edge<00:01:58.350> in<00:01:58.619> its<00:01:58.770> correct<00:01:58.979> position<00:01:59.130> and

edge in its correct position and

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.950 
edge in its correct position and
orientation<00:02:00.119> but<00:02:00.509> it's<00:02:00.689> corresponding

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
orientation but it's corresponding

corner<00:02:01.710> is<00:02:01.890> not<00:02:02.219> it's<00:02:03.030> right<00:02:03.180> here<00:02:03.450> so<00:02:03.689> we<00:02:03.810> can

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
corner is not it's right here so we can

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.870 
corner is not it's right here so we can
move<00:02:04.049> this<00:02:04.259> bottom<00:02:04.560> layer<00:02:04.680> over<00:02:05.189> just<00:02:05.759> like

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
move this bottom layer over just like

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.150 
move this bottom layer over just like
this<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.270> this<00:02:06.360> empty<00:02:06.780> slot<00:02:07.049> then<00:02:07.530> insert<00:02:07.950> this

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
this to this empty slot then insert this

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.150 
this to this empty slot then insert this
piece<00:02:08.479> then<00:02:09.479> we<00:02:09.599> bring<00:02:10.080> this<00:02:10.229> over<00:02:10.440> this<00:02:10.890> pair

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
piece then we bring this over this pair

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.550 
piece then we bring this over this pair
is<00:02:11.190> solved<00:02:11.849> a<00:02:12.060> relatively<00:02:12.660> uncommon<00:02:13.110> case<00:02:13.379> in

which this technique is very useful is

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.760 
which this technique is very useful is
when<00:02:15.510> one<00:02:15.750> corner<00:02:16.080> is<00:02:16.260> in<00:02:16.349> its<00:02:16.500> correct

a<00:02:27.120> situation<00:02:27.420> we<00:02:27.959> can<00:02:28.110> solve<00:02:28.290> both<00:02:28.500> pairs

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
a situation we can solve both pairs

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.740 
a situation we can solve both pairs
simultaneously<00:02:29.610> by<00:02:29.879> pairing<00:02:30.180> up<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.420> on<00:02:30.540> top

corner and edge pieces while inserting
for<00:02:33.090> example<00:02:33.510> here<00:02:33.840> we<00:02:33.930> can<00:02:34.050> move<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.379> bottom

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
for example here we can move the bottom

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.710 
for example here we can move the bottom
layer<00:02:34.769> over<00:02:35.220> compare<00:02:35.910> up<00:02:35.970> and<00:02:36.120> insert<00:02:36.420> these

two<00:02:37.019> pieces<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:38.430> then<00:02:38.610> move<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:38.910> bottom

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
two pieces and then move the bottom

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.690 
two pieces and then move the bottom
layer<00:02:39.360> back<00:02:39.830> keep<00:02:40.830> in<00:02:40.950> mind<00:02:41.129> that<00:02:41.250> it<00:02:41.370> can<00:02:41.519> be

layer back keep in mind that it can be

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.280 
layer back keep in mind that it can be
pretty<00:02:41.940> difficult<00:02:42.209> to<00:02:42.450> recognize<00:02:42.930> how<00:02:43.230> the

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
pretty difficult to recognize how the

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.990 
pretty difficult to recognize how the
pieces<00:02:43.620> should<00:02:43.860> be<00:02:43.920> paired<00:02:44.220> up<00:02:44.340> since<00:02:44.849> the

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
pieces should be paired up since the

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.790 
pieces should be paired up since the
colors<00:02:45.269> don't<00:02:45.480> match<00:02:45.750> up<00:02:45.780> as<00:02:46.230> they<00:02:46.410> would<00:02:46.620> with

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
colors don't match up as they would with

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.680 
colors don't match up as they would with
a<00:02:46.830> normal<00:02:47.250> pair<00:02:47.519> these<00:02:47.940> ideas<00:02:48.360> are<00:02:48.510> also

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
a normal pair these ideas are also

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.839 
a normal pair these ideas are also
commonly<00:02:49.110> used<00:02:49.170> for<00:02:49.500> X<00:02:49.769> crosses<00:02:50.370> in<00:02:50.670> this

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
commonly used for X crosses in this

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:52.790 
commonly used for X crosses in this
situation<00:02:51.360> we<00:02:51.480> have<00:02:51.599> these<00:02:51.810> two<00:02:51.989> pieces<00:02:52.200> this

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
situation we have these two pieces this

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.949 
situation we have these two pieces this
and<00:02:53.040> this<00:02:53.310> so<00:02:53.940> we<00:02:54.060> can<00:02:54.180> move<00:02:54.300> this<00:02:54.540> down<00:02:54.690> move

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
and this so we can move this down move

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.990 
and this so we can move this down move
this<00:02:55.170> down<00:02:55.379> the<00:02:55.769> mythis<00:02:56.129> over<00:02:56.430> and<00:02:56.550> then<00:02:56.670> bring

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
this down the mythis over and then bring

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.149 
this down the mythis over and then bring
this<00:02:57.239> back<00:02:57.450> down<00:02:57.659> so<00:02:58.319> it's<00:02:58.440> pretty<00:02:58.620> easy<00:02:58.769> cross

00:02:59.149 --> 00:02:59.159 
this back down so it's pretty easy cross

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:01.580 
this back down so it's pretty easy cross
however<00:02:59.790> we<00:03:00.150> can<00:03:00.629> also<00:03:00.840> notice<00:03:01.140> that<00:03:01.290> this

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
however we can also notice that this

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.949 
however we can also notice that this
piece<00:03:01.920> when<00:03:02.610> we<00:03:02.670> move<00:03:02.849> this<00:03:03.090> down<00:03:03.269> will<00:03:03.599> also

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
piece when we move this down will also

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.320 
piece when we move this down will also
be<00:03:04.170> in<00:03:04.379> its<00:03:04.500> correct<00:03:04.800> place<00:03:05.040> so<00:03:05.879> something<00:03:06.209> we

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
be in its correct place so something we

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.050 
be in its correct place so something we
can<00:03:06.450> do<00:03:06.599> is<00:03:06.810> before<00:03:07.550> bringing<00:03:08.550> this<00:03:08.670> down<00:03:08.730> and

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
can do is before bringing this down and

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.270 
can do is before bringing this down and
moving<00:03:09.180> it<00:03:09.360> over<00:03:09.510> something<00:03:10.379> we<00:03:10.650> can<00:03:10.800> do<00:03:11.010> is

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
moving it over something we can do is

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.430 
moving it over something we can do is
first<00:03:11.849> insert<00:03:12.300> this<00:03:12.510> edge<00:03:12.810> in<00:03:13.080> its<00:03:13.230> correct

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
first insert this edge in its correct

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.250 
first insert this edge in its correct
position<00:03:13.670> just<00:03:14.670> like<00:03:14.819> this<00:03:15.060> so<00:03:15.780> when<00:03:15.930> we<00:03:16.080> move

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
position just like this so when we move

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.619 
position just like this so when we move
it<00:03:16.409> over<00:03:16.530> we<00:03:17.370> have<00:03:17.489> this<00:03:17.640> pair<00:03:17.879> already<00:03:18.150> made

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:18.629 
it over we have this pair already made

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:20.630 
it over we have this pair already made
it's<00:03:19.200> worth<00:03:19.379> noting<00:03:19.739> that<00:03:19.769> sometimes<00:03:20.280> using

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
it's worth noting that sometimes using

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.280 
it's worth noting that sometimes using
this<00:03:20.760> technique<00:03:21.150> isn't<00:03:21.420> very<00:03:21.720> efficient<00:03:22.170> and

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
this technique isn't very efficient and

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.589 
this technique isn't very efficient and
thus<00:03:22.590> isn't<00:03:22.980> worth<00:03:23.129> the<00:03:23.280> trouble<00:03:23.519> for<00:03:24.209> example

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 
thus isn't worth the trouble for example

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:25.970 
thus isn't worth the trouble for example
I<00:03:24.750> usually<00:03:24.870> don't<00:03:25.230> use<00:03:25.290> this<00:03:25.470> when<00:03:25.709> there's<00:03:25.860> an

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
I usually don't use this when there's an

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.680 
I usually don't use this when there's an
edge<00:03:26.159> that's<00:03:26.489> in<00:03:26.640> its<00:03:26.790> correct<00:03:27.030> position<00:03:27.209> and

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
edge that's in its correct position and

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.899 
edge that's in its correct position and
orientation<00:03:28.170> simply<00:03:28.860> because<00:03:29.250> the<00:03:29.400> solution

00:03:29.899 --> 00:03:29.909 
orientation simply because the solution

00:03:29.909 --> 00:03:31.640 
orientation simply because the solution
to<00:03:30.060> such<00:03:30.239> case<00:03:30.540> isn't<00:03:30.930> that<00:03:31.019> bad<00:03:31.200> in<00:03:31.379> the<00:03:31.440> first

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
to such case isn't that bad in the first

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.710 
to such case isn't that bad in the first
place<00:03:31.980> other<00:03:32.640> situations<00:03:33.209> in<00:03:33.420> which<00:03:33.540> I

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
place other situations in which I

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.330 
place other situations in which I
probably<00:03:33.989> wouldn't<00:03:34.349> use<00:03:34.530> this<00:03:34.650> technique<00:03:35.040> our
