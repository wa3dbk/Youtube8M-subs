00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.099
 what a gift of people what delicacy what 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.170
 personality we can not hide it 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.240
 juliet starling the protagonist of the 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.279
 new lollipop chainsaw has something that 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.290
 has bewitched us there may be a good 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.000
 couple of reasons in between but without 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.400
 doubt we believe that most of the 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.500
 blame has its creator 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.420
 suda51 and is that the Japanese following his 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.550
 extravagant style and so personal has 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.739
 decided to give us another one of those videogames 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.390
 that maybe he will not sell much but yes 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.589
 will get out of the routine to the 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.589
 lovers of this industry 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.920
 [Music] 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.539
 what strategy has been used in this 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.879
 occasion here grasshopper manufacture what 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:04.670
 I was pretty clear 18 year old girl 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.500
 recently completed more chainsaw and a 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.210
 horde of gruesome zombies to whom 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.670
 annihilate any player's dream 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.440
 come true you can see curves of a 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.270
 stunning blonde while 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.720
 blood on your screen 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.720
 TV 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.000
 all with a noble mission to end the 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.890
 suffering of your classmates and 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.260
 infected teachers in the institute 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.150
 sandro mere turned into undead 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.670
 now we will no longer have any impediment 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.860
 moral to slice their heads amputate 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.990
 its members and even separate it and 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.119
 they get silly Juliette is pure 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.920
 show in this sense combining 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.470
 his status as a zombie hunter with 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.580
 her style as cheerleader the result what 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.580
 you have before your eyes 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.600
 lollipop chainsaw is an authentic orgy 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:51.189
 of blows to right and left with a 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.560
 good repertoire of techniques and 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.869
 combinations that includes the state 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.520
 special rainbow one that will turn 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.950
 to our innocent cheerleader in a 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.960
 ruthless killing machine however 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.060
 the macabre spectacle is not so varied 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.670
 as to counteract them simple and 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.140
 something repetitive mechanics of the title and 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.850
 what the video game tries 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.620
 giving us the opportunity to expand 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.570
 our skills through the 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.850
 chop shop to show 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:17.890
 [Music] 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.930
 and the abundance of quicktime events 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.000
 go to the action to try to break 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.130
 with the monotony however open 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.750
 doors is not too attractive though 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.760
 there are some sections that do deserve 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.710
 I do not know how to understand is true for 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.040
 the clueless we put it on camera 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.040
 slow 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.830
 you have already lost your head as one who 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.690
 yes he has done it has been the boyfriend of 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.050
 juliette which serves as a pretext for 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.950
 that we experience some mini-games 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.660
 unfortunately not everyone enjoys the 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.370
 same luck but they do present 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.620
 good dose of humor almost as 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.270
 abundant as those of blood if still 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.500
 you have not noticed lollipop 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.570
 chainsaw is a show 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.700
 humorously visceral but also 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.890
 very sensual here you have another good 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.160
 example 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.980
 [Music] 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.440
 deliberately delusional Suda 51 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.270
 get what a videogame proposes 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.130
 nonsensical something that would not have been 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.470
 possible without the explosion of colorful and 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.930
 effects proposed by the title that yes 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.790
 with some ups and downs that hang us 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.440
 if we complain about the design of juliette and 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.690
 its curves but grasshopper manufacture 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.520
 I should have also dedicated something else 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.710
 of time to the scenarios quite 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.210
 simpletons and the camera is also not 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.790
 better but at least you can manage 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.770
 freely and we believe and we tell you that 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.899
 It will be very useful 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.899
 [Music] 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.270
 a video game in conclusion very 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.800
 carefree that nevertheless will remain 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:42.050
 in a crazy night with this blonde 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.970
 destroys zombies we would have liked that 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:46.100
 its so insinuating as bloodthirsty 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.320
 interactive parade had more spark and 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.880
 will last longer but the 6 hours that 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.710
 we will be with juliette we believe that 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.870
 will be a good alternative for 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.580
 that they like this type of creations to 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:56.750
 nobody feels bad a caramelito once 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:01.680
 in when truth 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.680
