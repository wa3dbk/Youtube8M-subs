00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.680 
so in that sense I'm not worried because
I<00:05:34.380> know<00:05:34.530> that<00:05:34.800> she<00:05:34.980> knows<00:05:35.190> who<00:05:35.430> she<00:05:35.640> is<00:05:35.669> but<00:05:36.540> in

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
I know that she knows who she is but in

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.810 
I know that she knows who she is but in
terms<00:05:36.960> of<00:05:37.200> this<00:05:37.500> project<00:05:37.980> it<00:05:38.220> was<00:05:38.250> slightly

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 
terms of this project it was slightly

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.030 
terms of this project it was slightly
underwhelming<00:05:39.419> to<00:05:39.960> me<00:05:40.080> slightly

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:41.040 
underwhelming to me slightly

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.100 
underwhelming to me slightly
underwhelming<00:05:41.580> I<00:05:41.910> didn't<00:05:42.240> get<00:05:42.600> from<00:05:42.810> her<00:05:42.960> what

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
underwhelming I didn't get from her what

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.170 
underwhelming I didn't get from her what
I<00:05:43.140> wanted<00:05:43.380> to<00:05:43.710> and<00:05:43.950> I<00:05:44.190> wanted<00:05:44.669> to<00:05:44.820> like<00:05:44.970> this

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
I wanted to and I wanted to like this

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.490 
I wanted to and I wanted to like this
project<00:05:45.570> a<00:05:45.720> lot<00:05:46.260> more<00:05:47.070> than<00:05:47.430> I<00:05:47.460> did<00:05:47.910> my<00:05:48.500> issue

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
project a lot more than I did my issue

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.760 
project a lot more than I did my issue
is<00:05:49.919> that<00:05:50.030> it<00:05:51.030> was<00:05:51.300> very<00:05:51.600> hard<00:05:51.930> for<00:05:52.020> me<00:05:52.229> to<00:05:52.440> pick

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
is that it was very hard for me to pick

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.860 
is that it was very hard for me to pick
out<00:05:52.950> tracks<00:05:53.490> or<00:05:53.729> to<00:05:53.910> kind<00:05:54.090> of<00:05:54.210> distinguish

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870 
out tracks or to kind of distinguish

00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:00.140 
out tracks or to kind of distinguish
tracks<00:05:55.370> one<00:05:56.370> track<00:05:56.669> from<00:05:56.970> the<00:05:57.150> next<00:05:57.720> um<00:05:57.950> I<00:05:59.150> feel

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
tracks one track from the next um I feel

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.950 
tracks one track from the next um I feel
that<00:06:00.210> the<00:06:01.100> feature<00:06:02.100> she<00:06:02.490> had<00:06:02.729> almost<00:06:03.510> kind<00:06:03.870> of

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 
that the feature she had almost kind of

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:07.760 
that the feature she had almost kind of
saved<00:06:04.350> her<00:06:05.150> features<00:06:06.150> on<00:06:06.300> childsplay<00:06:06.780> Babylon

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:07.770 
saved her features on childsplay Babylon

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.460 
saved her features on childsplay Babylon
and<00:06:08.010> warm<00:06:08.400> winds<00:06:08.790> she<00:06:09.510> kind<00:06:09.720> of<00:06:09.810> held<00:06:10.050> her<00:06:10.260> own

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:10.470 
and warm winds she kind of held her own

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.070 
and warm winds she kind of held her own
on<00:06:10.830> tracks<00:06:11.130> like<00:06:11.250> Julia<00:06:11.910> and<00:06:12.150> your<00:06:12.600> which<00:06:12.930> she

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 
on tracks like Julia and your which she

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.100 
on tracks like Julia and your which she
kind<00:06:13.290> of<00:06:13.350> took<00:06:14.240> hold<00:06:15.240> of<00:06:15.360> and<00:06:15.570> took<00:06:15.690> charge<00:06:15.750> of

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.110 
kind of took hold of and took charge of

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.860 
kind of took hold of and took charge of
herself<00:06:16.560> she<00:06:16.710> delivered<00:06:17.250> those<00:06:17.400> well<00:06:17.669> but<00:06:18.419> she

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870 
herself she delivered those well but she

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:20.600 
herself she delivered those well but she
needed<00:06:19.110> those<00:06:19.380> features<00:06:19.830> on<00:06:20.010> the<00:06:20.160> project

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:20.610 
needed those features on the project

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:22.219 
needed those features on the project
otherwise<00:06:21.000> it<00:06:21.180> would<00:06:21.330> have<00:06:21.419> sounded<00:06:21.570> like<00:06:21.870> one

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:22.229 
otherwise it would have sounded like one

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:26.750 
otherwise it would have sounded like one
whole<00:06:22.590> track<00:06:23.070> almost<00:06:23.780> morphed<00:06:24.780> into<00:06:25.310> just<00:06:26.310> one

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:26.760 
whole track almost morphed into just one

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.990 
whole track almost morphed into just one
except<00:06:27.300> for<00:06:27.330> the<00:06:27.510> track<00:06:27.780> Julia<00:06:28.370> in<00:06:29.370> terms<00:06:29.760> of

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000 
except for the track Julia in terms of

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.060 
except for the track Julia in terms of
scissor<00:06:30.330> I<00:06:30.660> would<00:06:31.080> like<00:06:31.290> to<00:06:31.440> see<00:06:31.620> what<00:06:31.770> she<00:06:31.919> has

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:32.070 
scissor I would like to see what she has

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:35.120 
scissor I would like to see what she has
to<00:06:32.360> give<00:06:33.360> next<00:06:33.750> because<00:06:34.050> I<00:06:34.349> want<00:06:34.650> more<00:06:34.860> upbeat

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.130 
to give next because I want more upbeat

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:39.470 
to give next because I want more upbeat
tempo<00:06:35.900> more<00:06:36.900> I<00:06:37.010> distinct<00:06:38.010> hooks

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:39.480 
tempo more I distinct hooks

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.260 
tempo more I distinct hooks
more<00:06:39.750> distinct<00:06:40.700> content<00:06:41.700> I<00:06:41.880> hate<00:06:42.120> having

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:42.270 
more distinct content I hate having

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:45.290 
more distinct content I hate having
scraped<00:06:43.050> through<00:06:43.350> the<00:06:43.410> content<00:06:44.130> and<00:06:44.520> you<00:06:45.180> know

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:45.300 
scraped through the content and you know

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.630 
scraped through the content and you know
some<00:06:45.630> may<00:06:45.780> say<00:06:46.020> maybe<00:06:46.320> my<00:06:46.530> eyes<00:06:46.740> just<00:06:47.100> haven't

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:47.640 
some may say maybe my eyes just haven't

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.090 
some may say maybe my eyes just haven't
opened<00:06:48.090> wide<00:06:48.960> enough<00:06:49.230> to<00:06:49.560> kind<00:06:49.740> of<00:06:49.770> get<00:06:49.950> what

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:50.100 
opened wide enough to kind of get what

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.250 
opened wide enough to kind of get what
she's<00:06:50.280> saying<00:06:50.310> but<00:06:50.880> I<00:06:50.910> feel<00:06:51.240> for<00:06:51.900> a<00:06:51.930> lot<00:06:52.080> of<00:06:52.110> the

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:52.260 
she's saying but I feel for a lot of the

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.770 
she's saying but I feel for a lot of the
tracks<00:06:52.500> I'm<00:06:52.650> having<00:06:52.920> to<00:06:53.040> dig<00:06:53.340> out<00:06:53.580> what<00:06:54.510> she's

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:54.780 
tracks I'm having to dig out what she's

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:55.280 
tracks I'm having to dig out what she's
saying

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:55.290 
saying

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:57.710 
saying
and<00:06:55.790> you<00:06:56.790> know<00:06:56.910> I<00:06:56.940> don't<00:06:57.090> want<00:06:57.270> to<00:06:57.330> have<00:06:57.420> to<00:06:57.570> do

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:57.720 
and you know I don't want to have to do

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:58.820 
and you know I don't want to have to do
that<00:06:57.870> when<00:06:57.990> I'm<00:06:58.110> listening<00:06:58.260> to<00:06:58.440> someone<00:06:58.770> I

00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:58.830 
that when I'm listening to someone I

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:00.290 
that when I'm listening to someone I
don't<00:06:59.100> want<00:06:59.220> to<00:06:59.280> have<00:06:59.370> to<00:06:59.520> force<00:06:59.820> to<00:07:00.060> like

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:00.300 
don't want to have to force to like

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.810 
don't want to have to force to like
something<00:07:01.080> when<00:07:01.980> I<00:07:02.010> just<00:07:02.400> don't

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:02.820 
something when I just don't

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:07.580 
something when I just don't
so<00:07:03.390> this<00:07:03.690> project<00:07:04.110> for<00:07:04.500> me<00:07:04.650> I<00:07:04.950> feel<00:07:06.290> if<00:07:07.290> I<00:07:07.440> would

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:07.590 
so this project for me I feel if I would

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:11.690 
so this project for me I feel if I would
say<00:07:07.710> was<00:07:08.520> it<00:07:08.610> a<00:07:08.700> hit<00:07:08.970> or<00:07:09.240> a<00:07:09.300> miss<00:07:10.460> it<00:07:11.460> would<00:07:11.610> be

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:11.700 
say was it a hit or a miss it would be

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:15.890 
say was it a hit or a miss it would be
very<00:07:11.940> hard<00:07:12.150> for<00:07:12.210> me<00:07:12.390> to<00:07:12.420> say<00:07:12.750> because<00:07:13.260> um<00:07:14.900> would

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:15.900 
very hard for me to say because um would

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.200 
very hard for me to say because um would
I<00:07:16.400> recommend<00:07:17.400> it<00:07:17.610> for<00:07:17.670> someone<00:07:17.910> else<00:07:18.060> to

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:18.210 
I recommend it for someone else to

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:19.760 
I recommend it for someone else to
listen<00:07:18.420> to<00:07:18.540> yes<00:07:19.020> because<00:07:19.260> she's<00:07:19.560> different

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:19.770 
listen to yes because she's different

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:21.230 
listen to yes because she's different
and<00:07:20.160> she<00:07:20.310> has<00:07:20.460> something<00:07:20.640> different<00:07:21.120> to<00:07:21.210> say

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:21.240 
and she has something different to say

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:24.110 
and she has something different to say
and<00:07:21.720> she's<00:07:22.050> very<00:07:22.410> pure<00:07:22.890> very<00:07:23.400> vulnerable<00:07:23.700> and

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:24.120 
and she's very pure very vulnerable and

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:27.080 
and she's very pure very vulnerable and
very<00:07:24.180> very<00:07:24.810> very<00:07:25.140> authentic<00:07:25.920> will<00:07:26.640> I<00:07:26.670> suggest

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:27.090 
very very very authentic will I suggest

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:27.920 
very very very authentic will I suggest
that<00:07:27.180> it<00:07:27.300> will<00:07:27.420> hold<00:07:27.600> your<00:07:27.810> attention

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:27.930 
that it will hold your attention

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:29.720 
that it will hold your attention
throughout<00:07:28.530> the<00:07:28.650> whole<00:07:28.830> thing<00:07:29.100> no<00:07:29.460> you're

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:29.730 
throughout the whole thing no you're

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:31.760 
throughout the whole thing no you're
probably<00:07:29.850> gonna<00:07:30.090> do<00:07:30.300> a<00:07:30.330> lot<00:07:30.540> of<00:07:30.570> skipping<00:07:31.020> so

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:31.770 
probably gonna do a lot of skipping so

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:35.630 
probably gonna do a lot of skipping so
