even though we're in the same gang

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.590 
even though we're in the same gang
because<00:01:40.890> there's<00:01:41.070> deceit<00:01:41.520> involved<00:01:42.180> we<00:01:42.450> have

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
because there's deceit involved we have

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.300 
because there's deceit involved we have
premium<00:01:43.020> mines<00:01:43.380> in<00:01:43.590> there<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:43.920> only<00:01:44.040> premium

ranks can get you out of it but there's

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.050 
ranks can get you out of it but there's
PvP<00:01:46.500> in<00:01:46.590> there<00:01:46.710> so<00:01:46.860> it's<00:01:47.009> not<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.159> pure<00:01:47.460> win<00:01:47.700> if

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060
