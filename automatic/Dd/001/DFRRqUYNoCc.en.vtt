00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.560 

I<00:00:05.150> recently<00:00:06.150> removed<00:00:06.390> the<00:00:06.629> sunroof<00:00:07.140> pal<00:00:07.500> from

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:08.570 
I recently removed the sunroof pal from

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.970 
I recently removed the sunroof pal from
w123<00:00:09.620> 300d<00:00:10.620> and<00:00:11.870> if<00:00:12.870> this<00:00:13.200> doesn't<00:00:13.710> show<00:00:13.920> you

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
w123 300d and if this doesn't show you

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.250 
w123 300d and if this doesn't show you
the<00:00:14.309> importance<00:00:14.849> of<00:00:15.059> lubrication<00:00:15.599> I<00:00:15.960> don't

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
the importance of lubrication I don't

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.410 
the importance of lubrication I don't
know<00:00:16.470> what<00:00:16.740> will<00:00:17.039> a<00:00:17.310> lot<00:00:17.760> of<00:00:17.789> times<00:00:17.910> people

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
know what will a lot of times people

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.179 
know what will a lot of times people
think<00:00:18.449> they<00:00:18.810> can<00:00:18.990> just<00:00:19.020> lubricate<00:00:20.010> the

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
think they can just lubricate the

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.939 
think they can just lubricate the
sunroof<00:00:20.609> tracks<00:00:20.939> and<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:22.140> little<00:00:22.410> grease<00:00:22.680> and

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
sunroof tracks and the little grease and

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.160 
sunroof tracks and the little grease and
everything<00:00:23.279> will<00:00:23.400> be<00:00:23.519> fine<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:24.449> problem<00:00:24.689> is

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
everything will be fine the problem is

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.900 
everything will be fine the problem is
that<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.650> lot<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:25.949> these<00:00:26.130> roughs<00:00:26.430> haven't<00:00:26.789> been

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
that a lot of these roughs haven't been

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.700 
that a lot of these roughs haven't been
properly<00:00:27.210> serviced<00:00:27.900> or<00:00:28.019> lubricated<00:00:28.529> for

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
properly serviced or lubricated for

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.740 
properly serviced or lubricated for
years<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:29.310> just<00:00:29.460> adding<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:29.939> little<00:00:30.150> grease<00:00:30.449> in

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
years and just adding a little grease in

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.620 
years and just adding a little grease in
the<00:00:30.960> track<00:00:31.700> isn't<00:00:32.700> going<00:00:32.880> to<00:00:33.000> cut<00:00:33.239> it<00:00:33.390> so

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
slides there's no other way to do this

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.830 
slides there's no other way to do this
so<00:01:00.649> let's<00:01:01.649> take<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.890> look<00:01:02.190> over<00:01:02.340> here<00:01:02.489> at<00:01:03.000> this

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
so let's take a look over here at this

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.990 
so let's take a look over here at this
slide<00:01:04.170> notice<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.920> slide<00:01:05.280> is<00:01:05.670> in<00:01:05.820> good

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
slide notice the slide is in good

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.640 
slide notice the slide is in good
condition<00:01:06.060> sometimes<00:01:06.720> you'll<00:01:07.200> see<00:01:07.439> these

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
condition sometimes you'll see these

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.130 
condition sometimes you'll see these
broken<00:01:08.040> but<00:01:09.000> these<00:01:09.210> are<00:01:09.360> okay<00:01:09.600> but<00:01:09.780> look<00:01:09.960> at

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
broken but these are okay but look at

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.969 
broken but these are okay but look at
what's<00:01:10.320> built<00:01:10.680> up<00:01:10.890> on<00:01:11.070> here<00:01:11.479> when<00:01:12.479> you<00:01:12.979> when

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
what's built up on here when you when

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.039 
what's built up on here when you when
you<00:01:14.070> try<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.310> scrape<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.909> stuff<00:01:15.180> off<00:01:15.420> it's

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
you try to scrape the stuff off it's

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.399 
you try to scrape the stuff off it's
like<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.350> hardened<00:01:17.040> on<00:01:17.220> cake<00:01:17.729> grease<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.479> then

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
like a hardened on cake grease and then

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.789 
like a hardened on cake grease and then
looking<00:01:19.710> over<00:01:19.950> here<00:01:20.070> at<00:01:20.189> these<00:01:20.310> felt<00:01:20.610> pads

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
looking over here at these felt pads

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:26.450 
looking over here at these felt pads
this<00:01:22.799> is<00:01:23.070> just<00:01:23.369> like<00:01:23.610> hardened<00:01:24.830> junk<00:01:25.830> that<00:01:26.400> you

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
this is just like hardened junk that you

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.910 
this is just like hardened junk that you
have<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.850> kind<00:01:27.090> of<00:01:27.180> scrape<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:28.500> can<00:01:28.680> see

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
know whether it is a mechanical problem

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.080 
know whether it is a mechanical problem
or<00:03:26.079> a<00:03:26.139> grease<00:03:26.919> problem<00:03:27.310> let's<00:03:27.819> say<00:03:27.909> your

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
or a grease problem let's say your

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.869 
or a grease problem let's say your
sunroof<00:03:28.540> either<00:03:29.349> a<00:03:29.470> manual<00:03:29.859> non-tilting<00:03:30.549> or

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:30.879 
sunroof either a manual non-tilting or

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:33.030 
sunroof either a manual non-tilting or
non-tilting<00:03:31.359> rough<00:03:31.720> tilting<00:03:32.680> ruffs<00:03:32.889> are<00:03:33.010> a

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
non-tilting rough tilting ruffs are a

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.110 
non-tilting rough tilting ruffs are a
little<00:03:33.129> bit<00:03:33.310> different<00:03:33.519> because<00:03:33.729> they<00:03:34.000> had

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
little bit different because they had

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.780 
little bit different because they had
that<00:03:34.329> weird<00:03:34.569> mechanism<00:03:35.260> inside<00:03:35.590> but<00:03:36.579> let's

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
that weird mechanism inside but let's

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.860 
that weird mechanism inside but let's
say<00:03:37.090> on<00:03:37.389> a<00:03:37.449> hot<00:03:38.319> afternoon<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:40.150> roof<00:03:40.419> works

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
say on a hot afternoon the roof works

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.219 
say on a hot afternoon the roof works
fine<00:03:41.169> but<00:03:41.979> on<00:03:42.099> a<00:03:42.129> cold<00:03:42.549> morning<00:03:42.879> the<00:03:43.720> roof<00:03:43.989> will

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:44.229 
fine but on a cold morning the roof will

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:47.460 
fine but on a cold morning the roof will
hardly<00:03:44.560> move<00:03:44.919> in<00:03:45.250> almost<00:03:46.030> every<00:03:46.540> case<00:03:46.780> I<00:03:47.109> have

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
hardly move in almost every case I have

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.099 
hardly move in almost every case I have
determined<00:03:47.859> that<00:03:48.189> that's<00:03:48.939> a<00:03:49.209> grease<00:03:49.599> related

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:50.109 
determined that that's a grease related

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:51.629 
determined that that's a grease related
problem<00:03:50.379> because<00:03:50.560> that<00:03:50.709> grease<00:03:51.009> is<00:03:51.250> hardened

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:51.639 
problem because that grease is hardened

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:54.059 
problem because that grease is hardened
up<00:03:51.759> with<00:03:51.939> age<00:03:52.150> and<00:03:52.689> as<00:03:53.139> it<00:03:53.259> warms<00:03:53.470> up<00:03:53.769> it'll

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:54.069 
up with age and as it warms up it'll

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:55.379
