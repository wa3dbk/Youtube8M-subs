00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.160 
sponge if you'd like but I tend to
prefer<00:01:56.100> brushes<00:01:57.060> because<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.450> think<00:01:57.719> it<00:01:58.020> gives

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
prefer brushes because I think it gives

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.350 
prefer brushes because I think it gives
me<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.560> most<00:01:58.740> control<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.460> I<00:01:59.759> have<00:01:59.939> a<00:01:59.969> couple

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
me the most control and I have a couple

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.990 
me the most control and I have a couple
of<00:02:00.540> different<00:02:01.049> brushes<00:02:01.500> right<00:02:01.890> here<00:02:02.000> and

different shapes and different

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.820 
different shapes and different
is<00:02:05.180> the<00:02:06.180> thumb<00:02:06.570> rule<00:02:06.780> is<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.409> dense<00:02:07.650> of

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
is the thumb rule is that the dense of

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.490 
is the thumb rule is that the dense of
the<00:02:07.920> brush<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.610> more<00:02:08.759> pigment<00:02:09.330> it'll<00:02:09.959> it'll

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
the brush the more pigment it'll it'll

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.170 
the brush the more pigment it'll it'll
pick<00:02:10.770> up<00:02:10.920> from<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.430> blush<00:02:11.640> pan

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.510 
I actually prefer using really small
brushes<00:02:14.970> such<00:02:15.720> as<00:02:15.959> this<00:02:16.230> one<00:02:16.590> which<00:02:16.890> which<00:02:17.310> is

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
I had for a long time ago because it

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.640 
I had for a long time ago because it
gives<00:02:24.060> me<00:02:24.180> a<00:02:24.300> lot<00:02:24.480> of<00:02:24.569> control<00:02:25.020> and<00:02:25.050> I<00:02:25.380> really

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
gives me a lot of control and I really

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.160 
gives me a lot of control and I really
like<00:02:25.800> how<00:02:26.430> soft<00:02:26.790> and<00:02:27.000> flexible<00:02:27.209> it<00:02:27.569> is<00:02:27.720> the

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
like how soft and flexible it is the

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.900 
like how soft and flexible it is the
stippling<00:02:28.560> brush<00:02:28.709> is<00:02:29.010> a<00:02:29.040> great<00:02:29.280> choice<00:02:29.550> if

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
stippling brush is a great choice if

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.030 
stippling brush is a great choice if
you're<00:02:30.150> a<00:02:30.209> beginner<00:02:30.510> because<00:02:30.680> it's<00:02:31.680> not<00:02:31.860> very

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
you're a beginner because it's not very

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.500 
you're a beginner because it's not very
dense<00:02:32.250> so<00:02:32.520> it<00:02:32.580> won't<00:02:32.819> pick<00:02:33.000> up<00:02:33.090> too<00:02:33.330> much

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
dense so it won't pick up too much

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.199 
dense so it won't pick up too much
pigment<00:02:33.989> and<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.770> size<00:02:34.980> is<00:02:35.310> just<00:02:35.670> absolutely

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
pigment and the size is just absolutely

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.820 
pigment and the size is just absolutely
perfect<00:02:36.450> for<00:02:36.840> one<00:02:36.989> cheek<00:02:37.260> so<00:02:37.530> you<00:02:37.590> actually

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
perfect for one cheek so you actually

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.280 
perfect for one cheek so you actually
just<00:02:38.190> have<00:02:38.280> to<00:02:38.519> dab<00:02:38.760> it<00:02:38.790> on<00:02:39.060> and<00:02:39.090> and<00:02:39.540> a<00:02:40.050> blend

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
just have to dab it on and and a blend

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.280 
just have to dab it on and and a blend
back<00:02:40.680> a<00:02:40.709> little<00:02:40.980> bit<00:02:41.250> another<00:02:42.239> blush<00:02:42.930> brush

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
back a little bit another blush brush

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.229 
back a little bit another blush brush
which<00:02:43.620> is<00:02:43.830> quite<00:02:44.100> versatile<00:02:44.550> is<00:02:44.760> this<00:02:45.030> one

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
which is quite versatile is this one

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.720 
which is quite versatile is this one
from<00:02:45.450> Real<00:02:45.660> Techniques<00:02:45.870> I<00:02:46.440> like<00:02:47.070> the<00:02:47.250> point<00:02:47.519> of

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
from Real Techniques I like the point of

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.800 
from Real Techniques I like the point of
the<00:02:48.300> the<00:02:48.720> brush<00:02:49.230> to<00:02:50.220> really<00:02:50.580> buff<00:02:51.090> out<00:02:51.330> the

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
the the brush to really buff out the

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.380 
the the brush to really buff out the
blush<00:02:52.080> but<00:02:52.819> personally<00:02:53.819> I<00:02:53.880> think<00:02:54.239> it's<00:02:54.330> a

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
blush but personally I think it's a

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.809 
blush but personally I think it's a
little<00:02:54.510> too<00:02:54.810> big<00:02:55.050> for<00:02:55.260> my<00:02:55.410> liking<00:02:55.680> and<00:02:56.610> the

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
going to start to apply my my blush just

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.560 
going to start to apply my my blush just
right<00:03:43.200> here<00:03:43.440> and<00:03:43.560> then<00:03:44.070> I<00:03:44.190> like<00:03:44.400> to<00:03:44.430> blend<00:03:45.180> back

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
right here and then I like to blend back

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.289 
right here and then I like to blend back
and<00:03:45.930> use<00:03:46.680> circular<00:03:46.950> motions<00:03:47.190> to<00:03:47.640> really<00:03:48.060> give

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
and use circular motions to really give

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.229 
and use circular motions to really give
a<00:03:48.540> seamless<00:03:49.489> appearance<00:03:50.489> on<00:03:50.700> the<00:03:50.880> skin<00:03:51.120> you

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
a seamless appearance on the skin you

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:52.789 
a seamless appearance on the skin you
can<00:03:51.390> of<00:03:51.480> course<00:03:51.510> blend<00:03:52.019> down<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.380> middle<00:03:52.560> if

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
can of course blend down the middle if

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.819 
can of course blend down the middle if
you<00:03:52.950> like<00:03:53.190> to<00:03:53.400> and<00:03:53.900> I'd<00:03:54.900> say<00:03:55.200> just<00:03:55.470> go<00:03:55.709> ahead

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
you like to and I'd say just go ahead

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.490 
you like to and I'd say just go ahead
and<00:03:56.220> look<00:03:56.400> at<00:03:56.489> your<00:03:56.730> face<00:03:57.000> and<00:03:57.329> find<00:03:58.079> out<00:03:58.260> what

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
and look at your face and find out what

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.500 
and look at your face and find out what
suits<00:03:58.799> you<00:03:59.010> the<00:03:59.160> best<00:03:59.370> but<00:03:59.579> be<00:03:59.790> careful<00:04:00.299> not<00:04:00.450> to

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
suits you the best but be careful not to

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.690 
suits you the best but be careful not to
bring<00:04:00.989> in<00:04:01.170> the<00:04:01.290> blush<00:04:01.500> too<00:04:01.799> far<00:04:02.070> to<00:04:02.280> watch<00:04:02.459> your

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
bring in the blush too far to watch your

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.560 
bring in the blush too far to watch your
nose<00:04:03.410> so<00:04:04.410> just<00:04:04.709> keep<00:04:05.459> blending<00:04:05.670> and<00:04:06.150> add<00:04:06.540> a

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
nose so just keep blending and add a

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.170 
nose so just keep blending and add a
little<00:04:06.870> more<00:04:07.109> as<00:04:07.200> you<00:04:07.350> go<00:04:07.560> it's<00:04:07.920> better<00:04:08.190> to<00:04:08.549> to

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
little more as you go it's better to to

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.580 
little more as you go it's better to to
build<00:04:09.420> the<00:04:09.840> color<00:04:10.079> slowly<00:04:10.410> go<00:04:10.680> to

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
build the color slowly go to

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:13.770 
build the color slowly go to
put<00:04:12.010> a<00:04:12.040> lot<00:04:12.250> of<00:04:12.370> color<00:04:12.580> on<00:04:12.760> your<00:04:13.090> face<00:04:13.300> at<00:04:13.570> once

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
put a lot of color on your face at once

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.170 
put a lot of color on your face at once
because<00:04:14.140> it'll<00:04:14.440> be<00:04:14.590> harder<00:04:15.040> to<00:04:15.070> blend<00:04:15.310> and<00:04:15.790> it

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
because it'll be harder to blend and it

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.479 
because it'll be harder to blend and it
will<00:04:16.360> look<00:04:16.959> way<00:04:17.200> more<00:04:17.500> natural<00:04:17.680> if<00:04:18.130> you<00:04:18.250> just

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
will look way more natural if you just

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.110 
will look way more natural if you just
work<00:04:19.060> in<00:04:19.329> in<00:04:19.870> layers<00:04:20.200> and<00:04:20.609> you<00:04:21.609> don't<00:04:21.820> you

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
work in in layers and you don't you

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.660 
work in in layers and you don't you
don't<00:04:22.330> get<00:04:22.510> too<00:04:23.110> heavy-handed<00:04:23.530> well<00:04:24.490> I<00:04:24.520> think

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:24.670 
don't get too heavy-handed well I think

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:26.580 
don't get too heavy-handed well I think
this<00:04:25.000> is<00:04:25.150> enough<00:04:25.450> blush<00:04:25.780> for<00:04:26.110> me<00:04:26.290> today
