00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
this cuz glad bees aren't that good but

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.460 
this cuz glad bees aren't that good but
don't<00:02:48.180> flame<00:02:48.510> us<00:02:49.310> crevice<00:02:50.310> it<00:02:51.000> works<00:02:51.470> like

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
don't flame us crevice it works like

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.060 
don't flame us crevice it works like
faster<00:02:53.040> in<00:02:53.250> this<00:02:53.370> format<00:02:53.670> then<00:02:53.910> soul<00:02:54.570> release

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
faster in this format then soul release

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.160 
faster in this format then soul release
so<00:02:56.070> yeah<00:02:56.400> it's<00:02:56.580> better<00:02:56.760> to<00:02:57.000> have<00:02:57.300> these<00:02:57.930> in

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
so yeah it's better to have these in

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.050 
so yeah it's better to have these in
your<00:02:58.260> side<00:02:58.530> then<00:02:58.770> to<00:02:58.890> have<00:02:58.980> soul<00:02:59.220> release<00:02:59.340> but

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
your side then to have soul release but

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.190 
your side then to have soul release but
even<00:03:00.300> though<00:03:00.390> slow<00:03:00.570> release<00:03:00.780> gets<00:03:00.990> more<00:03:01.170> I

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
even though slow release gets more I

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.290 
even though slow release gets more I
mean<00:03:01.440> these<00:03:01.770> are<00:03:01.920> faster<00:03:02.280> so<00:03:03.590> oppression<00:03:04.590> and

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
mean these are faster so oppression and

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.000 
mean these are faster so oppression and
it<00:03:06.300> might<00:03:06.510> sound<00:03:06.660> kinda<00:03:06.930> stupid<00:03:07.080> but<00:03:07.290> like<00:03:07.500> if

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
it might sound kinda stupid but like if

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.220 
it might sound kinda stupid but like if
you<00:03:08.220> can<00:03:08.520> get<00:03:08.730> your<00:03:08.850> deck<00:03:09.120> to<00:03:09.390> work<00:03:10.110> around

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
you can get your deck to work around

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.020 
you can get your deck to work around
depression<00:03:10.590> and<00:03:11.040> that's<00:03:11.190> that's<00:03:11.610> pretty<00:03:11.760> good
