this<00:00:22.150> racetrack<00:00:22.390> where<00:00:23.230> there's<00:00:23.380> not<00:00:23.500> a<00:00:23.560> lot

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:23.800 
this racetrack where there's not a lot

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.470 
this racetrack where there's not a lot
of<00:00:23.830> concrete<00:00:24.130> and<00:00:24.790> you<00:00:24.940> know<00:00:25.029> what<00:00:25.180> you<00:00:25.300> hold

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:25.480 
of concrete and you know what you hold

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.960 
of concrete and you know what you hold
concrete<00:00:25.960> together<00:00:26.230> with<00:00:26.439> don't<00:00:26.770> you<00:00:26.970> rebar

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:27.970

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.030 
concrete together with don't you rebar
rebar<00:00:28.480> and<00:00:28.750> so<00:00:28.960> I<00:00:28.990> think<00:00:29.350> there's<00:00:29.950> a

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:30.040 
rebar and so I think there's a

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.170 
rebar and so I think there's a
possibility<00:00:30.760> I<00:00:31.300> don't<00:00:31.600> know<00:00:31.720> this<00:00:31.930> for<00:00:32.140> a<00:00:32.169> fact

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
possibility I don't know this for a fact
