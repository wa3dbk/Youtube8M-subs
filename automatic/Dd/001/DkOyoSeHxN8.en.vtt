what it sounds like the idea is that you

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.950 
what it sounds like the idea is that you

coming up with better ways to do it

coming up with better ways to do it
first<00:01:36.270> they<00:01:36.570> tried<00:01:36.810> delivering<00:01:37.350> the

your nose and into your stomach which

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.330 
your nose and into your stomach which
worked<00:01:41.880> but<00:01:42.180> again<00:01:42.869> not<00:01:43.200> really<00:01:43.470> ideal<00:01:44.009> if<00:01:44.250> a

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
worked but again not really ideal if a

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.920 
worked but again not really ideal if a
patient<00:01:44.700> gags<00:01:44.970> or<00:01:45.299> vomits<00:01:45.659> during<00:01:45.869> the

procedure they could potentially inhale
fecal<00:01:48.210> matter<00:01:48.360> which<00:01:48.600> sounds<00:01:48.960> like

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
fecal matter which sounds like

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.319 
fecal matter which sounds like
absolutely<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.310> worst<00:01:50.430> thing<00:01:50.670> ever<00:01:50.820> so<00:01:51.210> they

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
absolutely the worst thing ever so they

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.910 
absolutely the worst thing ever so they
came<00:01:51.479> up<00:01:51.540> with<00:01:51.689> another<00:01:51.990> idea<00:01:52.079> that's<00:01:52.619> so

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
came up with another idea that's so

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.499 
came up with another idea that's so
simple<00:01:53.189> it's<00:01:53.520> kind<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:53.909> amazing<00:01:54.119> nobody

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
simple it's kind of amazing nobody

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.240 
simple it's kind of amazing nobody
thought<00:01:54.810> of<00:01:54.960> this<00:01:55.049> before<00:01:55.439> they<00:01:55.680> just<00:01:55.920> put<00:01:56.130> it

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
thought of this before they just put it

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.920 
thought of this before they just put it
in<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.460> pill<00:01:56.670> they<00:01:57.000> figured<00:01:57.299> patients<00:01:57.689> would<00:01:57.810> be

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
in a pill they figured patients would be

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.780 
in a pill they figured patients would be
way<00:01:58.200> less<00:01:58.380> likely<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.799> vomit<00:01:59.219> from<00:01:59.399> that<00:01:59.549> and

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
way less likely to vomit from that and

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.760 
way less likely to vomit from that and
by<00:02:00.119> freezing<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.750> pills<00:02:00.960> they<00:02:01.229> wouldn't<00:02:01.500> need

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
by freezing the pills they wouldn't need

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.039 
by freezing the pills they wouldn't need
anybody<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.280> make<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.430> fresh<00:02:03.090> donation<00:02:03.899> they

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
anybody to make a fresh donation they

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.120 
anybody to make a fresh donation they
could<00:02:04.200> just<00:02:04.350> keep<00:02:04.530> them<00:02:04.710> in<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:04.890> freezer

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
could just keep them in the freezer

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.740 
could just keep them in the freezer
what's<00:02:05.549> hilarious<00:02:05.640> though<00:02:06.180> is<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:06.479> the

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
what's hilarious though is that the

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.900 
what's hilarious though is that the
capsules<00:02:07.259> themselves<00:02:07.890> have<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.369> be<00:02:08.489> acid

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
capsules themselves have to be acid

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.669 
capsules themselves have to be acid
resistant<00:02:09.390> in<00:02:09.539> order<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.869> make<00:02:10.050> it<00:02:10.170> past<00:02:10.470> the

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
resistant in order to make it past the

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.670 
resistant in order to make it past the
stomach<00:02:10.890> and<00:02:11.190> into<00:02:11.400> your

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
stomach and into your

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.190 
stomach and into your
test<00:02:11.920> ins<00:02:12.280> and<00:02:12.370> unfortunately<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.480> only<00:02:13.659> acid

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
test ins and unfortunately the only acid

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.099 
test ins and unfortunately the only acid
resistant<00:02:14.680> capsules<00:02:15.159> on<00:02:15.370> the<00:02:15.459> market<00:02:15.849> are

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:16.109 
resistant capsules on the market are

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:19.349 
resistant capsules on the market are
translucent<00:02:17.109> which<00:02:17.829> is<00:02:18.040> not<00:02:18.640> great<00:02:18.790> of<00:02:19.120> course

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:19.359 
translucent which is not great of course

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:20.640 
translucent which is not great of course
if<00:02:19.450> you<00:02:19.540> have<00:02:19.659> a<00:02:19.689> c-diff<00:02:20.019> infection<00:02:20.469> I'm

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
if you have a c-diff infection I'm

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.259 
if you have a c-diff infection I'm
guessing<00:02:21.069> that's<00:02:21.189> a<00:02:21.340> small<00:02:21.640> price<00:02:21.819> to<00:02:21.939> pay<00:02:22.239> for

00:02:22.259 --> 00:02:22.269 
guessing that's a small price to pay for

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:24.360 
guessing that's a small price to pay for
immediate<00:02:23.079> relief<00:02:23.379> so<00:02:23.650> they<00:02:23.769> put<00:02:23.980> these<00:02:24.099> pills

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
immediate relief so they put these pills

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.309 
immediate relief so they put these pills
into<00:02:24.670> production<00:02:25.120> and<00:02:25.510> tested<00:02:25.930> them<00:02:26.049> on<00:02:26.079> a
