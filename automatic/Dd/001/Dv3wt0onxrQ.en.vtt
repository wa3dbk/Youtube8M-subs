I said before there are loads of
different<00:01:31.619> sizes<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.810> get<00:01:33.990> one<00:01:34.200> two

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
different sizes and you get one two

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.950 
different sizes and you get one two
three<00:01:34.770> four<00:01:35.040> five<00:01:35.310> six<00:01:35.549> seven<00:01:35.939> eight<00:01:36.030> nine<00:01:36.479> so

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
three four five six seven eight nine so

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.590 
three four five six seven eight nine so
you<00:01:37.049> get<00:01:37.200> nine<00:01:37.439> on<00:01:37.770> each<00:01:38.009> row<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:39.180> what<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.450> can

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
you get nine on each row so what you can

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.300 
you get nine on each row so what you can
do<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:39.900> just<00:01:40.049> kind<00:01:40.350> of<00:01:40.409> hold<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.829> above<00:01:41.130> your

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.720 
what we're going to do is we're going to
use<00:02:23.990> the<00:02:24.990> nail<00:02:25.230> buffer<00:02:25.530> again<00:02:26.810> just<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:28.140> like

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
use the nail buffer again just to like

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.180 
use the nail buffer again just to like
buff<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.970> end<00:02:30.180> and<00:02:30.660> that<00:02:30.959> will<00:02:31.230> just<00:02:31.890> sort<00:02:32.160> of

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
buff the end and that will just sort of

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.130 
buff the end and that will just sort of
like<00:02:32.400> cut<00:02:33.000> it<00:02:33.030> a<00:02:33.330> little<00:02:33.390> bit<00:02:33.780> and<00:02:33.930> it<00:02:34.050> will

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
like cut it a little bit and it will

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.970 
like cut it a little bit and it will
make<00:02:35.100> it<00:02:35.250> easier<00:02:35.550> for<00:02:35.610> you<00:02:35.819> to<00:02:35.970> pull<00:02:36.120> it<00:02:36.209> off<00:02:36.980> so

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
make it easier for you to pull it off so

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.120 
make it easier for you to pull it off so
when<00:02:38.160> there's<00:02:38.370> a<00:02:38.459> little<00:02:39.530> break<00:02:40.530> there<00:02:40.890> you

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
when there's a little break there you

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.970 
when there's a little break there you
can<00:02:41.280> then<00:02:41.310> just<00:02:41.640> pull<00:02:41.880> it<00:02:42.590> and<00:02:43.590> then<00:02:43.709> that's

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
can then just pull it and then that's

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.860 
can then just pull it and then that's
pretty<00:02:44.160> much<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:44.520> first<00:02:44.700> one<00:02:44.970> done<00:02:45.239> and<00:02:45.480> if

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
pretty much the first one done and if

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.740 
pretty much the first one done and if
there's<00:02:46.140> anything<00:02:46.500> where<00:02:46.950> any<00:02:47.510> sort<00:02:48.510> of<00:02:48.570> bits

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
there's anything where any sort of bits

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.270 
there's anything where any sort of bits
overhanging<00:02:49.320> then<00:02:49.560> this<00:02:49.709> is<00:02:49.860> where<00:02:50.040> you<00:02:50.130> can

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
overhanging then this is where you can

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.520 
overhanging then this is where you can
take<00:02:50.550> your<00:02:51.150> little<00:02:51.300> cuticle<00:02:51.930> cutter<00:02:52.080> and<00:02:52.440> just
