two<00:00:04.330> things<00:00:04.540> that<00:00:04.750> really<00:00:04.930> jumped<00:00:05.350> off<00:00:05.500> the

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:05.710 
two things that really jumped off the

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.549 
two things that really jumped off the
page<00:00:05.920> for<00:00:05.950> for<00:00:06.760> us<00:00:06.880> from<00:00:07.320> attributes<00:00:08.320> that<00:00:08.440> the

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:08.559 
page for for us from attributes that the

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:10.140 
page for for us from attributes that the
power<00:00:08.769> hitter<00:00:09.040> was<00:00:09.219> looking<00:00:09.549> for<00:00:09.730> the<00:00:09.879> number

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:10.150 
power hitter was looking for the number

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.509 
power hitter was looking for the number
one<00:00:10.299> thing<00:00:10.509> by<00:00:10.660> far<00:00:10.690> was<00:00:11.110> distance<00:00:11.530> and<00:00:11.740> just

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:12.519 
one thing by far was distance and just

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:15.150 
one thing by far was distance and just
overall<00:00:12.849> performance<00:00:13.299> so<00:00:14.039> distance<00:00:15.039> an

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.160 
overall performance so distance an

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.160 
overall performance so distance an
overall<00:00:15.730> popper<00:00:16.150> performances<00:00:16.750> with<00:00:16.900> the<00:00:16.929> two

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.170 
overall popper performances with the two

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.990 
overall popper performances with the two
attributes<00:00:18.070> the<00:00:18.189> power<00:00:18.369> guy<00:00:18.580> was<00:00:18.730> looking<00:00:18.849> for

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.000 
attributes the power guy was looking for

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.540 
attributes the power guy was looking for
I<00:00:19.390> look<00:00:19.689> for<00:00:19.900> about<00:00:20.140> that<00:00:21.009> I<00:00:21.070> feel<00:00:21.160> good

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:21.550 
I look for about that I feel good

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.669 
I look for about that I feel good
balance<00:00:21.970> you<00:00:22.210> know<00:00:23.019> I<00:00:23.050> feel<00:00:23.380> and<00:00:23.589> I<00:00:23.650> feel

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:23.679 
balance you know I feel and I feel

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:25.919 
balance you know I feel and I feel
comfortable<00:00:24.339> when<00:00:24.519> I<00:00:24.550> grab<00:00:24.820> the<00:00:24.970> back<00:00:25.179> and<00:00:25.779> I

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:25.929 
comfortable when I grab the back and I

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:27.779 
comfortable when I grab the back and I
know<00:00:25.990> that<00:00:26.320> us<00:00:26.500> that's<00:00:27.160> a<00:00:27.279> bar<00:00:27.460> they're<00:00:27.640> gonna

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:27.789 
know that us that's a bar they're gonna

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:30.359 
know that us that's a bar they're gonna
do<00:00:28.029> damage<00:00:28.300> yeah<00:00:28.900> this<00:00:29.560> technology<00:00:30.189> does

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.369 
do damage yeah this technology does

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:32.280 
do damage yeah this technology does
things<00:00:30.669> that<00:00:30.820> aluminum<00:00:31.240> can't<00:00:31.539> do<00:00:31.779> those

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
things that aluminum can't do those

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.709 
things that aluminum can't do those
things<00:00:32.619> that<00:00:32.860> composite<00:00:33.579> can't<00:00:34.059> do<00:00:34.270> those

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
things that titanium can't do in terms

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.479 
things that titanium can't do in terms
of<00:00:37.360> generating<00:00:38.050> ball<00:00:38.410> speed<00:00:38.710> especially<00:00:38.949> for

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
of generating ball speed especially for

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:41.760 
of generating ball speed especially for
that<00:00:39.579> power<00:00:39.850> hitter<00:00:40.239> at<00:00:41.020> the<00:00:41.199> core<00:00:41.440> here

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:41.770 
that power hitter at the core here

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.500 
that power hitter at the core here
there's<00:00:42.160> an<00:00:42.340> aluminum<00:00:42.760> bat<00:00:42.910> but<00:00:43.210> then<00:00:43.329> there's

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
there's an aluminum bat but then there's

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.979 
there's an aluminum bat but then there's
a<00:00:43.570> very<00:00:43.750> special<00:00:45.030> polymer<00:00:46.030> sleeve<00:00:46.329> that<00:00:46.840> is

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
a very special polymer sleeve that is

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:49.889 
a very special polymer sleeve that is
injected<00:00:47.350> and<00:00:47.829> embedded<00:00:48.670> onto<00:00:48.969> the<00:00:49.420> aluminum

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:49.899 
injected and embedded onto the aluminum

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:52.770 
injected and embedded onto the aluminum
and<00:00:50.640> this<00:00:51.640> does<00:00:51.879> some<00:00:52.090> very<00:00:52.300> special<00:00:52.750> things

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
and this does some very special things

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.740 
and this does some very special things
for<00:00:53.050> this<00:00:53.260> bag<00:00:53.469> it's<00:00:53.890> able<00:00:54.219> to<00:00:54.519> reduce<00:00:55.420> the

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
for this bag it's able to reduce the

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.500 
for this bag it's able to reduce the
amount<00:00:55.780> that<00:00:56.379> the<00:00:56.859> ball<00:00:57.070> actually<00:00:57.340> deforms<00:00:58.329> at

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
amount that the ball actually deforms at

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:00.630 
amount that the ball actually deforms at
impact<00:00:59.050> so<00:00:59.260> you're<00:00:59.440> not<00:00:59.620> losing<00:01:00.010> that<00:01:00.370> energy

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
impact so you're not losing that energy

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.170 
impact so you're not losing that energy
that<00:01:01.120> energy<00:01:01.329> is<00:01:01.629> going<00:01:02.309> directly<00:01:03.309> into<00:01:03.429> the

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
that energy is going directly into the

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.359 
that energy is going directly into the
energy<00:01:04.510> of<00:01:04.869> the<00:01:05.019> ball<00:01:05.199> the<00:01:05.740> more<00:01:05.770> spin<00:01:06.250> you

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
energy of the ball the more spin you

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:08.190 
energy of the ball the more spin you
have<00:01:06.610> the<00:01:07.060> more<00:01:07.240> lift<00:01:07.479> you<00:01:07.659> get<00:01:07.840> and<00:01:08.080> the<00:01:08.170> more

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
have the more lift you get and the more

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.990 
have the more lift you get and the more
carry<00:01:08.650> so<00:01:09.189> not<00:01:09.369> only<00:01:09.490> are<00:01:09.670> you<00:01:09.729> getting<00:01:09.820> the

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
carry so not only are you getting the

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.270 
carry so not only are you getting the
greater<00:01:10.360> exit<00:01:10.840> speed<00:01:11.049> from<00:01:11.290> max<00:01:11.530> core<00:01:11.830> you're

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
greater exit speed from max core you're

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.700 
greater exit speed from max core you're
also<00:01:12.400> getting<00:01:12.700> a<00:01:12.970> greater<00:01:13.570> spin<00:01:13.930> rate<00:01:14.110> and

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 
also getting a greater spin rate and

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.289 
also getting a greater spin rate and
here<00:01:14.860> you<00:01:14.950> can<00:01:15.100> see<00:01:15.250> the<00:01:15.369> inner<00:01:15.520> structure<00:01:15.909> of

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:16.299 
here you can see the inner structure of

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:18.600 
here you can see the inner structure of
the<00:01:16.420> max<00:01:16.630> score<00:01:16.780> first<00:01:17.560> you<00:01:17.680> have<00:01:17.860> the<00:01:17.890> the

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
the max score first you have the the

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.690 
the max score first you have the the
