00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
ground war that's definitely a great

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.230 
ground war that's definitely a great
idea<00:01:41.280> because<00:01:41.640> there<00:01:41.790> are<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:41.880> ton<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.060> enemies

but what I really enjoy about the

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.550 
but what I really enjoy about the
warthog<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.360> swoops<00:02:06.689> over<00:02:07.079> 4<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.409> 5

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560

times<00:02:07.590> I'm<00:02:08.129> not<00:02:08.160> exactly<00:02:08.640> sure<00:02:08.970> if<00:02:09.000> it<00:02:09.149> does<00:02:09.300> to

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
times I'm not exactly sure if it does to

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.449 
times I'm not exactly sure if it does to
over<00:02:09.720> 4<00:02:09.899> to<00:02:09.959> 5<00:02:10.110> times<00:02:10.140> I'd<00:02:10.500> say<00:02:10.709> at<00:02:10.830> least<00:02:10.860> 3

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.369 
over 4 to 5 times I'd say at least 3
times<00:02:11.640> but<00:02:12.150> it<00:02:12.270> just<00:02:12.420> goes<00:02:12.569> absolutely<00:02:12.780> ham<00:02:13.349> I

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379

a<00:02:33.750> little<00:02:34.020> bit<00:02:34.170> so<00:02:34.650> again<00:02:35.100> guys<00:02:35.280> what<00:02:35.460> I'm

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
a little bit so again guys what I'm

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:36.800 
a little bit so again guys what I'm
going<00:02:35.670> to<00:02:35.700> be<00:02:35.790> talking<00:02:35.940> about<00:02:36.270> also<00:02:36.420> is<00:02:36.660> the

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
going to be talking about also is the

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.510 
going to be talking about also is the
orbital<00:02:37.170> visa<00:02:37.500> and<00:02:37.680> team<00:02:37.830> deathmatch<00:02:38.070> now

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
orbital visa and team deathmatch now

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.490 
orbital visa and team deathmatch now
well<00:02:39.000> I<00:02:39.060> think<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.450> orbital<00:02:39.750> visa<00:02:39.900> is<00:02:40.080> so<00:02:40.290> good

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
well I think the orbital visa is so good

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.810 
well I think the orbital visa is so good
in<00:02:40.590> team<00:02:40.740> deathmatch<00:02:40.950> is<00:02:41.310> because<00:02:41.550> in<00:02:41.670> team

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
in team deathmatch is because in team

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.760 
in team deathmatch is because in team
deathmatch<00:02:42.000> there<00:02:42.660> is<00:02:42.810> no<00:02:43.020> spawning<00:02:43.410> point<00:02:43.650> I

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
deathmatch there is no spawning point I

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:44.990 
deathmatch there is no spawning point I
mean<00:02:43.860> there's<00:02:44.040> a<00:02:44.100> spawning<00:02:44.550> plane<00:02:44.730> but<00:02:44.880> it's

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
mean there's a spawning plane but it's

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.490 
mean there's a spawning plane but it's
not<00:02:45.150> directed<00:02:45.570> anywhere<00:02:45.990> I<00:02:46.020> mean<00:02:46.200> you<00:02:46.320> can

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
not directed anywhere I mean you can

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.110 
not directed anywhere I mean you can
predict<00:02:46.860> it<00:02:47.040> the<00:02:47.310> way<00:02:47.460> to<00:02:47.520> predict<00:02:47.880> team

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
predict it the way to predict team

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.120 
predict it the way to predict team
deathmatch<00:02:48.360> spawns<00:02:48.840> is<00:02:49.050> to<00:02:49.170> go<00:02:49.260> exactly<00:02:49.890> where

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
deathmatch spawns is to go exactly where

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.710 
deathmatch spawns is to go exactly where
your<00:02:50.340> friendlies<00:02:50.910> are<00:02:51.090> where<00:02:51.300> the<00:02:51.360> people<00:02:51.630> on

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
your friendlies are where the people on

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.570 
your friendlies are where the people on
your<00:02:51.840> team<00:02:51.900> are<00:02:52.200> that's<00:02:52.680> exactly<00:02:53.340> where<00:02:53.460> the

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
your team are that's exactly where the

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:54.650 
your team are that's exactly where the
enemies<00:02:53.880> are<00:02:54.000> going<00:02:54.150> to<00:02:54.210> spawn<00:02:54.390> I<00:02:54.450> mean

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
enemies are going to spawn I mean

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:55.910 
enemies are going to spawn I mean
occasionally<00:02:55.140> you<00:02:55.200> get<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.410> little<00:02:55.590> bit<00:02:55.710> of<00:02:55.830> a

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
occasionally you get the little bit of a

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.260 
occasionally you get the little bit of a
messed<00:02:56.160> up<00:02:56.310> spawn<00:02:56.670> or<00:02:56.820> something<00:02:57.090> like<00:02:57.210> that

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
messed up spawn or something like that

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.180 
messed up spawn or something like that
but<00:02:57.930> I'm<00:02:58.110> telling<00:02:58.290> you<00:02:58.440> Rock<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.860> orbital

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
but I'm telling you Rock the orbital

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.250 
but I'm telling you Rock the orbital
view<00:02:59.310> side<00:02:59.520> if<00:02:59.820> you're<00:02:59.970> only<00:03:00.270> only<00:03:00.630> rocket<00:03:01.020> if

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
view side if you're only only rocket if

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.540 
view side if you're only only rocket if
you're<00:03:01.380> able<00:03:01.530> to<00:03:01.710> pull<00:03:01.860> it<00:03:01.980> off<00:03:02.070> I<00:03:02.250> mean<00:03:02.400> I

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
you're able to pull it off I mean I

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.040 
you're able to pull it off I mean I
don't<00:03:02.760> mean<00:03:02.940> to<00:03:03.060> brag<00:03:03.240> or<00:03:03.420> be<00:03:03.540> cocky<00:03:03.810> or

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
don't mean to brag or be cocky or

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.420 
don't mean to brag or be cocky or
anything<00:03:04.110> but<00:03:04.410> I<00:03:04.470> can<00:03:04.680> basically<00:03:04.800> pull<00:03:05.220> it<00:03:05.340> off

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
anything but I can basically pull it off

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.040 
anything but I can basically pull it off
usually<00:03:05.910> every<00:03:06.120> single<00:03:06.390> game<00:03:06.540> multiple<00:03:06.990> times

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
usually every single game multiple times

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.900 
usually every single game multiple times
in<00:03:07.410> a<00:03:07.470> game<00:03:07.590> occasionally<00:03:08.250> but<00:03:08.580> you<00:03:08.640> can<00:03:08.760> see

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
in a game occasionally but you can see

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.490 
in a game occasionally but you can see
right<00:03:09.030> there<00:03:09.210> I<00:03:09.240> pick<00:03:09.420> up<00:03:09.540> a<00:03:09.630> quad<00:03:10.050> feed<00:03:10.320> with

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
right there I pick up a quad feed with

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.750 
right there I pick up a quad feed with
my<00:03:10.620> lightning<00:03:10.980> strike<00:03:11.220> now<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.460> lightning

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
my lightning strike now the lightning

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.760 
my lightning strike now the lightning
strike<00:03:12.060> it's<00:03:12.390> a<00:03:12.540> pretty<00:03:12.780> lower<00:03:13.080> tier<00:03:13.350> streak

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
strike it's a pretty lower tier streak

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.470 
strike it's a pretty lower tier streak
so<00:03:13.980> I<00:03:14.010> definitely<00:03:14.580> suggest<00:03:14.700> you<00:03:15.000> guys<00:03:15.120> to<00:03:15.360> use

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
so I definitely suggest you guys to use

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.940 
so I definitely suggest you guys to use
it<00:03:15.690> because<00:03:15.810> it's<00:03:16.110> quite<00:03:16.320> easy<00:03:16.620> to<00:03:16.770> get

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
it because it's quite easy to get

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.950 
it because it's quite easy to get
actually<00:03:17.430> and<00:03:17.790> it<00:03:17.910> can<00:03:18.030> do<00:03:18.120> some<00:03:18.270> crazy<00:03:18.570> damage

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:18.960 
actually and it can do some crazy damage

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.600 
actually and it can do some crazy damage
it<00:03:19.170> also<00:03:19.290> works<00:03:19.620> really<00:03:19.860> well<00:03:20.070> an<00:03:20.160> objective

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
it also works really well an objective

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.280 
it also works really well an objective
based<00:03:20.820> game<00:03:21.030> modes<00:03:21.270> because<00:03:21.570> when<00:03:21.960> you<00:03:22.080> call

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
based game modes because when you call

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.390 
based game modes because when you call
it<00:03:22.380> in<00:03:22.470> when<00:03:22.620> you<00:03:22.680> see<00:03:22.830> somebody<00:03:23.160> else<00:03:23.190> is

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
it in when you see somebody else is

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.950 
it in when you see somebody else is
capturing<00:03:23.820> the<00:03:23.910> be<00:03:24.090> flag<00:03:24.360> or<00:03:24.570> something<00:03:24.600> like

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:24.960 
capturing the be flag or something like

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.360 
capturing the be flag or something like
that<00:03:25.200> that's<00:03:25.620> when<00:03:25.830> you<00:03:25.920> want<00:03:26.070> to<00:03:26.160> use<00:03:26.250> your

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
that that's when you want to use your

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
that that's when you want to use your
lightning<00:03:26.550> strike<00:03:26.910> I<00:03:26.940> mean<00:03:27.150> don't<00:03:27.330> just

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
lightning strike I mean don't just

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.810 
lightning strike I mean don't just
blatantly<00:03:27.900> play<00:03:28.140> put<00:03:29.040> it<00:03:29.190> out<00:03:29.310> there<00:03:29.490> anything

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
blatantly play put it out there anything

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.340 
blatantly play put it out there anything
like<00:03:29.940> that<00:03:29.970> because<00:03:30.630> when<00:03:30.780> you<00:03:30.810> blatantly<00:03:30.990> put

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
like that because when you blatantly put

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:32.870 
like that because when you blatantly put
it<00:03:31.440> out<00:03:31.530> there<00:03:31.740> just<00:03:31.920> really<00:03:32.190> it<00:03:32.310> just<00:03:32.340> it<00:03:32.700> does

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
it out there just really it just it does

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.310 
it out there just really it just it does
it<00:03:33.060> doesn't<00:03:33.390> do<00:03:33.510> too<00:03:33.750> well<00:03:33.930> at<00:03:33.960> all<00:03:34.200> I<00:03:34.230> mean

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
it doesn't do too well at all I mean

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.990 
it doesn't do too well at all I mean
nearly<00:03:34.980> not<00:03:35.190> at<00:03:35.340> all<00:03:35.460> because<00:03:35.610> I<00:03:35.730> mean<00:03:35.910> you

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
nearly not at all because I mean you

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.400 
nearly not at all because I mean you
maybe<00:03:36.150> you<00:03:36.330> want<00:03:36.600> and<00:03:36.720> kill<00:03:36.810> and<00:03:36.930> occasionally

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
maybe you want and kill and occasionally

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.660 
maybe you want and kill and occasionally
you<00:03:37.500> can<00:03:37.590> even<00:03:37.740> get<00:03:37.860> zero<00:03:38.190> kills<00:03:38.460> with<00:03:38.610> a

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
you can even get zero kills with a

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.250 
you can even get zero kills with a
lightning<00:03:38.970> strike<00:03:39.240> if<00:03:39.420> you<00:03:39.750> guys<00:03:39.840> don't<00:03:40.050> place

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
lightning strike if you guys don't place

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.630 
lightning strike if you guys don't place
it<00:03:40.440> correctly<00:03:40.560> but<00:03:40.950> when<00:03:41.100> playing<00:03:41.310> in<00:03:41.490> team

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
it correctly but when playing in team

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.860 
it correctly but when playing in team
deathmatch<00:03:41.670> you<00:03:42.210> want<00:03:42.390> to<00:03:42.450> make<00:03:42.600> sure<00:03:42.630> you

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
deathmatch you want to make sure you

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.810 
deathmatch you want to make sure you
have<00:03:43.020> a<00:03:43.050> UAV<00:03:43.320> up<00:03:43.680> before<00:03:44.310> you<00:03:44.460> use<00:03:44.490> your

have a UAV up before you use your

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.370 
have a UAV up before you use your
lightning<00:03:45.000> strike<00:03:45.390> because<00:03:45.720> that<00:03:46.140> way<00:03:46.320> you

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
lightning strike because that way you

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:47.660 
lightning strike because that way you
can<00:03:46.590> tell<00:03:46.710> where<00:03:46.860> the<00:03:46.920> enemies<00:03:47.220> are<00:03:47.250> at<00:03:47.430> if<00:03:47.580> you

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
can tell where the enemies are at if you

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.700 
can tell where the enemies are at if you
can<00:03:47.790> see<00:03:47.970> where<00:03:48.180> an<00:03:48.510> enemy<00:03:48.720> just<00:03:48.930> came<00:03:49.380> from<00:03:49.530> a

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:49.710 
can see where an enemy just came from a

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:51.320 
can see where an enemy just came from a
few<00:03:50.130> enemies<00:03:50.430> will<00:03:50.580> probably<00:03:50.910> be<00:03:51.030> spawning

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
few enemies will probably be spawning

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:52.370 
few enemies will probably be spawning
near<00:03:51.570> there<00:03:51.750> because<00:03:52.020> you<00:03:52.140> want<00:03:52.320> to

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
near there because you want to

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.020 
near there because you want to
definitely<00:03:52.770> hit<00:03:52.860> the<00:03:52.890> spawn<00:03:53.190> point<00:03:53.490> because<00:03:53.970> I

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
definitely hit the spawn point because I

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.520 
definitely hit the spawn point because I
believe<00:03:54.270> it<00:03:54.360> takes<00:03:54.540> 4<00:03:54.780> to<00:03:54.870> 5<00:03:54.990> seconds<00:03:55.350> for<00:03:55.470> the

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
believe it takes 4 to 5 seconds for the

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:56.840 
believe it takes 4 to 5 seconds for the
lightning<00:03:55.830> strike<00:03:56.040> actually<00:03:56.280> to<00:03:56.550> hit<00:03:56.700> and

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
lightning strike actually to hit and

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.280 
lightning strike actually to hit and
take<00:03:56.970> impact<00:03:57.390> and<00:03:57.570> kill<00:03:57.750> the<00:03:57.870> enemies<00:03:58.140> or

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
take impact and kill the enemies or

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.780 
take impact and kill the enemies or
something<00:03:58.560> like<00:03:58.650> that<00:03:58.710> just<00:03:59.100> over<00:03:59.550> I'll<00:03:59.640> make

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
something like that just over I'll make

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.370 
something like that just over I'll make
them<00:03:59.940> it<00:04:00.240> make<00:04:00.390> them<00:04:00.510> get<00:04:00.690> hurt<00:04:00.840> a<00:04:00.960> lot<00:04:01.140> and<00:04:01.260> I

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
them it make them get hurt a lot and I

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.560 
them it make them get hurt a lot and I
probably<00:04:01.620> probably<00:04:02.550> even<00:04:02.700> died<00:04:02.940> I<00:04:02.970> mean<00:04:03.210> you

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
probably probably even died I mean you

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.510 
probably probably even died I mean you
occasionally<00:04:04.020> you<00:04:04.410> occasionally<00:04:05.130> only<00:04:05.280> get<00:04:05.490> a

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
occasionally you occasionally only get a

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.010 
occasionally you occasionally only get a
few<00:04:05.760> hit<00:04:05.970> markers<00:04:06.270> as<00:04:06.390> well<00:04:06.540> with<00:04:06.930> the

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
few hit markers as well with the

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.720 
few hit markers as well with the
lightning<00:04:07.320> strike<00:04:07.560> but<00:04:07.950> most<00:04:08.400> of<00:04:08.490> the<00:04:08.580> time

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
lightning strike but most of the time

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:09.710 
lightning strike but most of the time
you'll<00:04:08.850> get<00:04:08.970> a<00:04:09.000> ton<00:04:09.180> of<00:04:09.210> kills<00:04:09.420> and<00:04:09.540> you<00:04:09.600> can

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
you'll get a ton of kills and you can

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.120 
you'll get a ton of kills and you can
see<00:04:09.840> right<00:04:09.960> there<00:04:10.020> my<00:04:10.230> warthog<00:04:10.650> gets<00:04:10.860> another

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
see right there my warthog gets another

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.160 
see right there my warthog gets another
quad<00:04:11.580> feed<00:04:11.820> you<00:04:11.970> can<00:04:12.120> guys<00:04:12.270> you<00:04:12.690> guys<00:04:12.810> can<00:04:12.990> tell

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
quad feed you can guys you guys can tell

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.420 
quad feed you can guys you guys can tell
that<00:04:13.290> these<00:04:13.410> score<00:04:13.680> streaks<00:04:13.950> is<00:04:14.040> definitely<00:04:14.370> a

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
that these score streaks is definitely a

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.890 
that these score streaks is definitely a
great<00:04:14.580> setup<00:04:14.910> I<00:04:15.090> would<00:04:15.210> definitely<00:04:15.570> say<00:04:15.720> these

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
great setup I would definitely say these

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.599 
great setup I would definitely say these
are<00:04:16.049> the<00:04:16.080> best<00:04:16.410> score<00:04:16.650> streaks<00:04:16.950> set<00:04:17.100> up<00:04:17.190> in<00:04:17.280> TDM

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
are the best score streaks set up in TDM

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.190 
are the best score streaks set up in TDM
I<00:04:17.820> mean<00:04:18.120> of<00:04:18.239> course<00:04:18.390> you<00:04:18.540> guys<00:04:18.690> can<00:04:18.870> rock<00:04:19.049> the

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
I mean of course you guys can rock the

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:20.960 
I mean of course you guys can rock the
regular<00:04:19.590> non-lethal<00:04:19.980> is<00:04:20.220> the<00:04:20.310> UAV<00:04:20.760> the

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
regular non-lethal is the UAV the

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.909 
regular non-lethal is the UAV the
counter<00:04:21.330> UAV<00:04:21.450> in<00:04:21.720> the<00:04:21.780> orbital<00:04:22.169> you<00:04:22.260> set<00:04:22.530> now

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
counter UAV in the orbital you set now

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:24.260 
counter UAV in the orbital you set now
I'm<00:04:23.010> going<00:04:23.130> to<00:04:23.190> go<00:04:23.280> into<00:04:23.430> a<00:04:23.550> little<00:04:23.850> bit<00:04:23.970> on<00:04:24.060> why

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
I'm going to go into a little bit on why

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.670 
I'm going to go into a little bit on why
that<00:04:24.510> is<00:04:24.630> such<00:04:24.810> a<00:04:24.840> great<00:04:25.020> set<00:04:25.290> of<00:04:25.320> routine

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
that is such a great set of routine

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.530 
that is such a great set of routine
deathmatch<00:04:26.070> so<00:04:26.310> why<00:04:26.490> is<00:04:26.550> such<00:04:26.790> a<00:04:26.820> great<00:04:27.060> scene

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
deathmatch so why is such a great scene

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.270 
deathmatch so why is such a great scene
a team<00:04:27.840> deathmatch<00:04:27.990> set<00:04:28.410> of<00:04:28.500> scorestreaks<00:04:29.190> is

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
a team deathmatch set of scorestreaks is

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.770 
a team deathmatch set of scorestreaks is
definitely<00:04:30.000> because<00:04:30.240> the<00:04:30.360> fact<00:04:30.570> team

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
definitely because the fact team

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.210 
definitely because the fact team
deathmatch<00:04:30.990> has<00:04:31.320> a<00:04:31.350> lot<00:04:31.590> to<00:04:31.620> do<00:04:31.830> with<00:04:31.920> knowing

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
deathmatch has a lot to do with knowing

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.500 
deathmatch has a lot to do with knowing
where<00:04:32.340> the<00:04:32.460> enemies<00:04:32.760> are<00:04:32.910> at<00:04:33.030> I<00:04:33.060> mean<00:04:33.270> if<00:04:33.420> you
