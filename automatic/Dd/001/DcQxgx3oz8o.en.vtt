00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
hard drive point the hard drive was set

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:29.469 
hard drive point the hard drive was set
up<00:05:23.360> in<00:05:23.569> there<00:05:25.330> but<00:05:26.919> I'll<00:05:27.919> be<00:05:28.039> taking<00:05:28.339> out<00:05:28.490> these

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:29.479 
up in there but I'll be taking out these

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:32.320 
up in there but I'll be taking out these
heat<00:05:29.689> sinks<00:05:30.020> later<00:05:30.259> and<00:05:30.939> that<00:05:31.939> does<00:05:32.149> look<00:05:32.270> like

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:32.330 
heat sinks later and that does look like
