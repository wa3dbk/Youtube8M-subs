00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
gonna place this in a tray that's a bit

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.510 
gonna place this in a tray that's a bit
bigger<00:02:37.960> pour<00:02:38.410> some<00:02:38.650> boiling<00:02:38.800> water<00:02:39.040> around

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
bigger pour some boiling water around

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.280 
bigger pour some boiling water around
the<00:02:39.730> edge<00:02:39.910> and<00:02:40.330> then<00:02:40.510> that<00:02:40.720> way<00:02:40.900> it'll<00:02:41.080> just

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
the edge and then that way it'll just

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.170 
the edge and then that way it'll just
melt<00:02:41.500> a<00:02:41.740> little<00:02:41.980> bit<00:02:42.100> around<00:02:42.340> the<00:02:42.490> edges<00:02:42.580> so

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
melt a little bit around the edges so

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.640 
melt a little bit around the edges so
that<00:02:43.330> it's<00:02:43.450> easier<00:02:43.810> for<00:02:43.870> it<00:02:44.170> to<00:02:44.260> come<00:02:44.500> out

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
that it's easier for it to come out

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.920 
that it's easier for it to come out
don't<00:02:45.460> want<00:02:45.640> to<00:02:45.790> leave<00:02:45.970> it<00:02:46.150> too<00:02:46.390> long<00:02:46.600> in<00:02:46.810> the

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
don't want to leave it too long in the

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.150 
don't want to leave it too long in the
hot<00:02:47.080> water<00:02:47.260> because<00:02:47.620> you<00:02:47.710> obviously<00:02:48.040> don't

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
hot water because you obviously don't

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.280 
hot water because you obviously don't
want<00:02:48.340> to<00:02:48.400> melt<00:02:48.580> the<00:02:48.820> dessert<00:02:49.150> so<00:02:49.960> just<00:02:50.170> a

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
minute or two and I'm just gonna use a

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.160 
minute or two and I'm just gonna use a
palette<00:02:57.820> knife<00:02:57.850> to<00:02:58.000> go<00:02:58.330> gently<00:02:58.720> around<00:02:58.810> the

00:02:59.160 --> 00:02:59.170 
palette knife to go gently around the

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.900 
palette knife to go gently around the
edge<00:02:59.290> hopefully<00:02:59.950> that<00:03:00.100> will<00:03:00.190> come<00:03:00.400> out<00:03:00.580> in<00:03:00.730> one

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
edge hopefully that will come out in one
