wrong<00:00:24.000> let<00:00:24.990> us<00:00:25.109> hope<00:00:25.289> do<00:00:26.250> I<00:00:26.279> think<00:00:26.369> there's

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
wrong let us hope do I think there's

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.050 
wrong let us hope do I think there's
value<00:00:26.880> in<00:00:27.599> Brock<00:00:28.019> for<00:00:28.260> WWE<00:00:28.800> absolutely<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:29.939> I

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
value in Brock for WWE absolutely and I

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.330 
value in Brock for WWE absolutely and I
think<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.359> real<00:00:30.539> value<00:00:30.779> is<00:00:31.230> in<00:00:31.410> him<00:00:31.619> as<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.859> baby

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
think the real value is in him as a baby

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.549 
think the real value is in him as a baby
face<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:33.020> don't<00:00:34.020> know<00:00:34.079> when<00:00:34.230> you<00:00:34.350> pull<00:00:34.530> the

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
face I don't know when you pull the

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.200 
face I don't know when you pull the
trigger<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:35.100> time<00:00:35.280> has<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.640> be<00:00:35.760> right<00:00:35.969> but<00:00:36.149> I

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
trigger the time has to be right but I

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.569 
trigger the time has to be right but I
think<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:37.559> get<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.770> most<00:00:38.010> out<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:38.250> him<00:00:38.399> as<00:00:38.550> a

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
think you get the most out of him as a

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.139 
think you get the most out of him as a
heel<00:00:38.879> so<00:00:39.780> maybe<00:00:40.530> not<00:00:40.770> right<00:00:41.070> after<00:00:41.370> mania<00:00:41.879> but

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
heel so maybe not right after mania but

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.900 
heel so maybe not right after mania but
I<00:00:42.360> think<00:00:42.660> as<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.809> baby<00:00:43.170> face<00:00:43.469> I<00:00:43.829> mean<00:00:44.610> he<00:00:44.789> would

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
I think as a baby face I mean he would

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.910 
I think as a baby face I mean he would
be<00:00:45.030> huge<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:46.050> key<00:00:46.289> there<00:00:46.469> would<00:00:46.680> be<00:00:46.710> to

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
be huge and the key there would be to

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.069 
be huge and the key there would be to
get<00:00:47.100> him<00:00:47.280> for<00:00:47.489> more<00:00:47.610> than<00:00:47.670> just<00:00:47.850> three<00:00:48.780> or<00:00:48.899> four

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
get him for more than just three or four

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.510 
get him for more than just three or four
shows<00:00:49.320> a<00:00:49.350> year<00:00:49.680> I<00:00:49.890> don't<00:00:50.100> know<00:00:50.160> how<00:00:50.309> much<00:00:50.460> more

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
shows a year I don't know how much more

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.979 
shows a year I don't know how much more
you<00:00:50.700> could<00:00:50.969> get<00:00:51.149> him<00:00:51.239> for<00:00:51.420> I<00:00:51.480> guess<00:00:51.690> the

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
you could get him for I guess the

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.660 
you could get him for I guess the
reality<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.590> economics<00:00:53.160> right<00:00:53.340> now<00:00:53.489> which

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
reality of the economics right now which

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.000 
reality of the economics right now which
is<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:53.910> it's<00:00:54.090> just<00:00:54.180> not<00:00:54.390> going<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.570> happen

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
is that it's just not going to happen

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.040 
is that it's just not going to happen
who<00:00:56.010> even<00:00:56.190> knows<00:00:56.370> if<00:00:56.520> he'll<00:00:56.789> resign<00:00:57.239> with<00:00:57.480> WWE

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
who even knows if he'll resign with WWE

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.810 
who even knows if he'll resign with WWE
mean<00:00:58.320> there's<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.530> very<00:00:58.770> distinct<00:00:59.219> possibility

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
mean there's a very distinct possibility

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.400 
mean there's a very distinct possibility
that<00:00:59.940> when<00:01:00.090> his<00:01:00.239> deal<00:01:00.420> is<00:01:00.480> up<00:01:00.719> at<00:01:00.870> WrestleMania

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
that when his deal is up at WrestleMania

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.860 
that when his deal is up at WrestleMania
that's<00:01:01.649> it<00:01:01.890> i<00:01:02.070> hope<00:01:02.609> not<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.359> really<00:01:03.719> do<00:01:03.840> I

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
that's it i hope not I really do I

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.359 
that's it i hope not I really do I
really<00:01:03.960> do<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.379> really<00:01:04.500> hope<00:01:04.890> they<00:01:05.010> keep<00:01:05.189> him

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
really do I really hope they keep him

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.730 
really do I really hope they keep him
around<00:01:05.489> I<00:01:06.000> think<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:07.049> gotta<00:01:07.260> work<00:01:07.530> out<00:01:07.710> a

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
around I think you gotta work out a

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.859 
around I think you gotta work out a
situation<00:01:08.430> with<00:01:08.610> him<00:01:08.850> where<00:01:09.090> he<00:01:09.330> can<00:01:09.360> show<00:01:09.720> up

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
situation with him where he can show up

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.140 
situation with him where he can show up
a<00:01:09.990> little<00:01:10.290> more<00:01:10.560> often<00:01:10.979> there's<00:01:11.700> just<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:12.030> many

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
a little more often there's just so many

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.300 
a little more often there's just so many
things<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.570> could<00:01:12.780> do<00:01:12.990> with<00:01:13.020> him<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.619> he's

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
things you could do with him and he's

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.890

this<00:01:35.880> guy<00:01:36.060> so<00:01:36.299> much<00:01:36.329> that<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.900> just<00:01:37.079> let<00:01:37.259> him

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
this guy so much that to just let him

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.620 
this guy so much that to just let him
walk<00:01:37.619> I<00:01:38.009> think<00:01:38.579> would<00:01:38.700> be<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.850> big<00:01:39.060> mistake<00:01:39.090> now

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
walk I think would be a big mistake now

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.300 
walk I think would be a big mistake now
you<00:01:39.689> could<00:01:39.930> argue<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.259> for<00:01:40.619> his<00:01:40.740> price<00:01:41.009> tag

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
you could argue that for his price tag

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.499 
you could argue that for his price tag
if<00:01:41.520> they're<00:01:41.640> paying<00:01:41.909> them<00:01:42.060> five<00:01:42.240> million

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
if they're paying them five million

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.830 
if they're paying them five million
dollars<00:01:42.960> which<00:01:43.170> I've<00:01:44.130> read<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.659> was

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
dollars which I've read that that was

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.609 
dollars which I've read that that was
what<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.110> deal<00:01:46.259> was<00:01:46.290> for<00:01:46.649> is<00:01:47.030> it<00:01:48.030> worth<00:01:48.240> it

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
what the deal was for is it worth it

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:51.230 
what the deal was for is it worth it
maybe<00:01:49.619> with<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.070> economics<00:01:50.670> of<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.939> current

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
maybe with the economics of the current

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.819 
maybe with the economics of the current
network<00:01:51.600> model<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.170> them<00:01:52.259> phasing<00:01:52.680> out<00:01:52.770> paper

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
network model and them phasing out paper

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.520 
network model and them phasing out paper
views<00:01:53.430> maybe<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.759> isn't<00:01:53.990> maybe<00:01:54.990> they<00:01:55.200> come<00:01:55.409> to

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
views maybe it isn't maybe they come to

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.990 
views maybe it isn't maybe they come to
that<00:01:55.680> realization<00:01:56.009> that<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.610> know<00:01:56.729> what<00:01:56.909> as

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
that realization that you know what as

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.459 
that realization that you know what as
much<00:01:57.149> as<00:01:57.270> we<00:01:57.390> want<00:01:57.659> to<00:01:57.750> keep<00:01:57.840> this<00:01:58.049> guy<00:01:58.259> it

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
much as we want to keep this guy it

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.749 
much as we want to keep this guy it
doesn't<00:01:58.740> make<00:01:58.799> any<00:01:58.979> sense<00:01:59.189> for<00:01:59.430> us<00:01:59.490> to<00:01:59.549> keep

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
doesn't make any sense for us to keep

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.319 
doesn't make any sense for us to keep
this<00:01:59.939> guy<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.360> I<00:02:01.200> would<00:02:01.680> keep<00:02:01.860> this<00:02:02.009> guy<00:02:02.219> I<00:02:02.490> think

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
this guy I I would keep this guy I think

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.670 
this guy I I would keep this guy I think
there's<00:02:03.479> a<00:02:03.540> lot<00:02:03.719> left<00:02:03.960> you<00:02:04.110> could<00:02:04.290> do<00:02:04.409> with<00:02:04.530> him

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
there's a lot left you could do with him

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.080 
there's a lot left you could do with him
and<00:02:04.799> I<00:02:04.860> think<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.219> real<00:02:05.430> money<00:02:05.700> is<00:02:05.790> in<00:02:05.909> the

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
and I think the real money is in the

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.840 
and I think the real money is in the
babyface<00:02:06.600> turn
