the<00:00:03.480> test<00:00:03.600> here<00:00:04.290> in<00:00:05.009> Oxfordshire<00:00:05.609> they're

the test here in Oxfordshire they're

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
so it wouldn't enable something that

so it wouldn't enable something that
looks<00:00:58.230> exactly<00:00:58.559> like<00:00:58.770> an<00:00:59.070> airplane<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.699> take

it again it's not quite Buck Rogers but
it<00:01:11.729> is<00:01:11.790> it's<00:01:12.119> not<00:01:12.299> far<00:01:12.570> off<00:01:12.600> there<00:01:12.960> it's<00:01:13.830> really

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
it is it's not far off there it's really

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.670 
it is it's not far off there it's really
it's<00:01:14.159> really<00:01:14.270> but<00:01:15.270> closest<00:01:15.720> still<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.409> the

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
it's really but closest still is the

Galactic's maiden flight is now just
weeks<00:01:21.780> away<00:01:22.110> it<00:01:22.979> will<00:01:23.189> be<00:01:23.250> a<00:01:23.640> game<00:01:24.150> changer

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
weeks away it will be a game changer

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.170 
weeks away it will be a game changer
well<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:25.799> don't<00:01:25.979> think<00:01:26.040> anybody<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.640> hundred

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
well I don't think anybody a hundred

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.390 
well I don't think anybody a hundred
years<00:01:27.360> ago<00:01:27.470> would<00:01:28.470> ever<00:01:28.710> have<00:01:28.890> guessed<00:01:29.070> that

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
years ago would ever have guessed that

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.590 
years ago would ever have guessed that
just<00:01:29.610> about<00:01:29.759> anybody<00:01:30.030> could<00:01:30.360> fly

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
just about anybody could fly

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.030 
just about anybody could fly
transatlantic<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.590> know<00:01:31.710> in<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:31.829> hundred

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
transatlantic you know in a hundred

transatlantic you know in a hundred
years<00:01:32.130> time<00:01:32.340> so<00:01:33.000> it's<00:01:33.119> difficult<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.540> say

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
years time so it's difficult to say

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.690 
years time so it's difficult to say
exactly<00:01:34.049> where<00:01:34.470> space<00:01:34.680> war<00:01:34.920> will<00:01:35.159> get<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.520> but

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
exactly where space war will get to but

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.580 
exactly where space war will get to but
I<00:01:35.729> do<00:01:35.850> think<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:36.299> will<00:01:36.390> become<00:01:36.750> perhaps<00:01:37.380> within

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
I do think it will become perhaps within

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.140 
I do think it will become perhaps within
most<00:01:37.920> peoples<00:01:38.280> reach<00:01:38.520> as<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.759> trip<00:01:38.970> of<00:01:39.090> a

most peoples reach as a trip of a

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
a fundamental shift in the way we think

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.070 
a fundamental shift in the way we think
