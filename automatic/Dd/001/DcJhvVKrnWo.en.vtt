00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
alright guys so I thought today

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.240 
alright guys so I thought today
the<00:00:10.200> day<00:00:10.410> they<00:00:11.129> were<00:00:11.190> released<00:00:11.639> try<00:00:11.820> to<00:00:11.879> fire

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:12.250 
the day they were released try to fire

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:14.680 
the day they were released try to fire
it<00:00:12.310> up<00:00:12.720> see

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690 
it up see

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.630 
it up see
motor<00:00:14.870> has<00:00:15.080> but<00:00:15.440> it's<00:00:15.740> not<00:00:16.039> and<00:00:16.279> I'll<00:00:16.369> show<00:00:16.580> you

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:16.640 
motor has but it's not and I'll show you

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.839 
motor has but it's not and I'll show you
why<00:00:17.210> so<00:00:17.480> you<00:00:18.349> my<00:00:18.650> last<00:00:18.860> video<00:00:19.220> filled<00:00:19.610> it<00:00:19.730> up

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:19.849 
why so you my last video filled it up

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:24.609 
why so you my last video filled it up
with<00:00:19.910> water<00:00:21.490> if<00:00:22.490> you<00:00:22.700> look<00:00:22.880> right<00:00:23.090> here<00:00:23.390> it<00:00:23.689> is

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:24.619 
with water if you look right here it is

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.040 
with water if you look right here it is
actively<00:00:25.099> drooping<00:00:25.669> and<00:00:25.820> that's<00:00:26.570> the<00:00:26.750> reason

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
actively drooping and that's the reason

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.929 
actively drooping and that's the reason
why<00:00:27.230> the<00:00:27.289> radiator<00:00:28.070> was<00:00:28.220> only<00:00:28.489> like<00:00:28.640> a<00:00:28.669> quarter

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
why the radiator was only like a quarter

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:31.209 
why the radiator was only like a quarter
full<00:00:29.270> the<00:00:29.480> reason<00:00:29.810> being<00:00:30.050> if<00:00:30.860> you<00:00:30.919> look<00:00:31.099> down

00:00:31.209 --> 00:00:31.219 
full the reason being if you look down

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:33.970 
full the reason being if you look down
here<00:00:31.489> with<00:00:31.579> this<00:00:31.700> water<00:00:31.939> pump<00:00:32.649> you<00:00:33.649> put<00:00:33.860> your

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
here with this water pump you put your

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.780 
here with this water pump you put your
hand<00:00:34.160> underneath<00:00:34.460> it<00:00:35.170> it's<00:00:36.170> wet<00:00:36.790> that's

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
hand underneath it it's wet that's

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.389 
hand underneath it it's wet that's
leaking<00:00:38.000> right<00:00:38.329> out<00:00:38.480> of<00:00:38.510> the<00:00:39.129> and<00:00:40.129> out<00:00:40.250> at<00:00:40.340> the

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399 
leaking right out of the and out at the

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:43.750 
leaking right out of the and out at the
bottom<00:00:40.610> of<00:00:40.850> that<00:00:41.030> so<00:00:42.010> that<00:00:43.010> is<00:00:43.280> gonna<00:00:43.489> have<00:00:43.730> to

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
bottom of that so that is gonna have to

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.540 
bottom of that so that is gonna have to
be<00:00:44.680> changed<00:00:45.680> so<00:00:45.770> I<00:00:45.800> just<00:00:46.010> went<00:00:46.160> ahead<00:00:46.219> and<00:00:46.489> I

original<00:01:03.620> I<00:01:03.710> was<00:01:03.800> thinking<00:01:04.129> it<00:01:04.250> was<00:01:04.339> just<00:01:04.550> real

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:04.760 
original I was thinking it was just real

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.100 
original I was thinking it was just real
eking<00:01:05.059> from<00:01:05.239> the<00:01:05.330> service<00:01:05.690> here<00:01:05.840> and<00:01:05.900> I<00:01:05.990> could

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
eking from the service here and I could

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.899 
eking from the service here and I could
oh<00:01:06.170> I<00:01:06.200> just<00:01:06.320> throw<00:01:06.560> a<00:01:06.590> gasket<00:01:06.979> on<00:01:07.070> it<00:01:07.220> and<00:01:07.520> use

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
oh I just throw a gasket on it and use

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:09.040 
oh I just throw a gasket on it and use
the<00:01:08.030> same<00:01:08.210> one<00:01:08.390> but<00:01:08.540> I<00:01:08.630> don't<00:01:08.690> think<00:01:08.870> it<00:01:09.020> is

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
the same one but I don't think it is

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.590 
the same one but I don't think it is
because<00:01:09.880> you<00:01:10.880> looking<00:01:11.150> there<00:01:11.300> exactly

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
because you looking there exactly

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.690 
because you looking there exactly
weeping<00:01:11.960> out<00:01:12.020> of<00:01:12.140> this<00:01:12.229> hole<00:01:12.500> which<00:01:13.460> what<00:01:13.670> I

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
weeping out of this hole which what I

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.870 
weeping out of this hole which what I
believe<00:01:14.090> that<00:01:14.330> means<00:01:14.510> that<00:01:14.810> the<00:01:14.930> seal<00:01:15.200> inside

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
believe that means that the seal inside

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.770 
believe that means that the seal inside
is<00:01:16.880> gone<00:01:17.210> so<00:01:17.630> new<00:01:18.290> water<00:01:18.560> pump<00:01:18.860> this<00:01:19.280> is<00:01:19.460> I

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:43.940 
gonna use this as fuel since I don't
know<00:02:15.200> about<00:02:15.319> the<00:02:15.530> fuel<00:02:15.739> tank<00:02:15.980> yet

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.200 

all<00:02:44.950> right<00:02:45.130> well<00:02:45.340> I'm<00:02:45.400> gonna<00:02:45.490> truth<00:02:45.820> to<00:02:46.000> see<00:02:46.150> if

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
all right well I'm gonna truth to see if

00:02:46.210 --> 00:03:22.970 
all right well I'm gonna truth to see if
we<00:02:46.330> have<00:02:46.420> spark

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:58.080 

all<00:03:23.980> right<00:03:24.160> I<00:03:24.190> sandpaper<00:03:24.790> the<00:03:25.000> point<00:03:25.239> so

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.480 

nope<00:03:59.090> not<00:03:59.420> today<00:04:00.069> so<00:04:01.069> we're<00:04:01.280> not<00:04:01.340> getting

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:01.490 
nope not today so we're not getting

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:03.970 
nope not today so we're not getting
spark<00:04:02.030> and<00:04:02.209> I<00:04:02.270> don't<00:04:02.390> know<00:04:02.480> ye<00:04:02.840> so<00:04:03.560> it<00:04:03.709> could<00:04:03.860> be

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
spark and I don't know ye so it could be

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.970 
spark and I don't know ye so it could be
a<00:04:04.010> coil<00:04:04.340> it<00:04:04.700> could<00:04:04.880> be<00:04:05.110> the<00:04:06.110> points<00:04:06.680> could<00:04:06.830> be<00:04:06.890> a

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
a coil it could be the points could be a

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.680 
a coil it could be the points could be a
condenser<00:04:07.580> it<00:04:07.760> could<00:04:07.910> be<00:04:08.000> a<00:04:08.030> spark<00:04:08.300> plug<00:04:08.480> wires

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:08.690 
condenser it could be a spark plug wires

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.949 
condenser it could be a spark plug wires
could<00:04:08.930> spark<00:04:09.260> plug<00:04:09.470> so<00:04:10.090> yeah<00:04:11.090> it's<00:04:11.480> not<00:04:11.570> doing

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
could spark plug so yeah it's not doing

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:15.910 
could spark plug so yeah it's not doing
anything<00:04:12.170> at<00:04:12.380> all<00:04:12.470> so<00:04:12.800> I<00:04:13.250> think<00:04:14.350> not<00:04:15.350> today<00:04:15.620> but

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
anything at all so I think not today but

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.449 
anything at all so I think not today but
the<00:04:15.980> next<00:04:16.220> day<00:04:16.250> we're<00:04:16.519> gonna<00:04:16.579> have<00:04:16.700> to<00:04:18.250> work<00:04:19.250> on

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
the next day we're gonna have to work on

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.959 
the next day we're gonna have to work on
the<00:04:19.640> ignition<00:04:20.540> system
