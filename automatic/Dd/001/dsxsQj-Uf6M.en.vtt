00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
yeah just a touch and intial make a lot

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.160 
yeah just a touch and intial make a lot
of<00:01:29.560> difference<00:01:29.980> a<00:01:30.480> millimeter<00:01:31.480> put<00:01:31.990> in<00:01:32.080> the

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
of difference a millimeter put in the

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.020 
of difference a millimeter put in the
homologous<00:01:32.620> up<00:01:33.040> top

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.520 

level<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:39.670> distance<00:01:40.120> of<00:01:40.270> it<00:01:40.420> wall<00:01:41.080> on<00:01:41.410> the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
level that distance of it wall on the

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.190 
level that distance of it wall on the
inside<00:01:42.060> well<00:01:43.060> I<00:01:43.120> think<00:01:43.210> a<00:01:43.450> lot<00:01:43.630> of<00:01:43.690> that<00:01:43.960> it's

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
inside well I think a lot of that it's

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.610 
inside well I think a lot of that it's
actually<00:01:44.610> this<00:01:45.610> way<00:01:45.850> it's<00:01:46.270> it's<00:01:47.170> very<00:01:47.230> like

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:47.620 
actually this way it's it's very like
