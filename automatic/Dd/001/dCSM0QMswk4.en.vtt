00:05:23.739 --> 00:05:23.749 

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:36.350 

my<00:05:24.749> turn<00:05:24.990> on<00:05:25.110> the<00:05:25.169> light

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.369 

alright<00:05:37.020> so<00:05:37.379> here's<00:05:37.889> a<00:05:37.979> lot<00:05:38.129> of<00:05:38.250> little<00:05:39.379> thing

00:05:40.369 --> 00:05:40.379 
alright so here's a lot of little thing

00:05:40.379 --> 00:06:00.239 
alright so here's a lot of little thing
that<00:05:40.650> I<00:05:41.219> had<00:05:41.520> to<00:05:41.669> learn

00:06:00.239 --> 00:06:00.249 

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:03.959 

if<00:06:00.759> the<00:06:00.999> game<00:06:01.239> sometimes<00:06:01.989> the<00:06:02.499> games<00:06:02.969> that

00:06:03.959 --> 00:06:03.969 
if the game sometimes the games that

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:08.219 
if the game sometimes the games that
were<00:06:04.229> previously<00:06:05.729> modded<00:06:06.729> with<00:06:07.119> the<00:06:07.299> e<00:06:07.779> boots

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:08.229 
were previously modded with the e boots

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:11.059 
were previously modded with the e boots
so<00:06:08.799> they<00:06:08.919> can<00:06:09.099> work<00:06:09.249> on<00:06:09.429> the<00:06:09.549> older<00:06:09.849> firmware

00:06:11.059 --> 00:06:11.069 
so they can work on the older firmware

00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:15.359 
so they can work on the older firmware
work<00:06:12.209> what<00:06:13.209> you<00:06:13.389> have<00:06:13.569> to<00:06:13.749> do<00:06:13.899> is<00:06:14.169> like<00:06:14.949> this

00:06:15.359 --> 00:06:15.369 
work what you have to do is like this

00:06:15.369 --> 00:06:18.329 
work what you have to do is like this
tech<00:06:15.669> in<00:06:15.819> here<00:06:16.089> this<00:06:16.629> second<00:06:17.079> I<00:06:17.259> had<00:06:17.559> a<00:06:17.589> booth

00:06:18.329 --> 00:06:18.339 
tech in here this second I had a booth

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:21.449 
tech in here this second I had a booth
mod<00:06:18.609> so<00:06:18.879> it<00:06:18.969> would<00:06:19.149> work<00:06:19.299> on<00:06:19.559> 3.55<00:06:20.559> custom

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:21.459 
mod so it would work on 3.55 custom

00:06:21.459 --> 00:06:24.779 
mod so it would work on 3.55 custom
firmware<00:06:22.259> so<00:06:23.259> if<00:06:23.559> you've<00:06:23.739> got<00:06:24.039> that<00:06:24.309> and<00:06:24.639> it

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:24.789 
firmware so if you've got that and it

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:26.429 
firmware so if you've got that and it
doesn't<00:06:25.059> load<00:06:25.299> with<00:06:25.509> a<00:06:25.539> new<00:06:25.719> firmware<00:06:26.229> what

00:06:26.429 --> 00:06:26.439 
doesn't load with a new firmware what

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:29.009 
doesn't load with a new firmware what
you've<00:06:26.589> got<00:06:26.769> to<00:06:26.889> do<00:06:27.039> is<00:06:27.249> select<00:06:27.759> the<00:06:28.029> game<00:06:28.239> so

firmware<00:06:47.019> I<00:06:47.610> believe<00:06:48.610> that's<00:06:48.729> what<00:06:48.969> it<00:06:49.059> does

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:49.239 
firmware I believe that's what it does

00:06:49.239 --> 00:06:51.989 
firmware I believe that's what it does
and<00:06:49.479> that's<00:06:49.719> what<00:06:49.929> I<00:06:50.110> was<00:06:50.319> told<00:06:50.499> it<00:06:50.709> does<00:06:51.639> and

00:06:51.989 --> 00:06:51.999 
and that's what I was told it does and

00:06:51.999 --> 00:06:56.509 
and that's what I was told it does and
it<00:06:52.469> works<00:06:53.469> fine<00:06:53.589> for<00:06:53.769> me<00:06:54.009> so<00:06:54.479> another<00:06:55.479> one<00:06:55.719> I
