on yet on the outside do the same on the
other<00:01:13.150> side

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.030 

-<00:01:25.550> this<00:01:25.700> kid<00:01:25.940> and<00:01:26.180> then<00:01:26.660> you<00:01:27.200> do<00:01:27.380> all<00:01:27.620> four

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
- this kid and then you do all four

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:35.620 
- this kid and then you do all four
quarters<00:01:28.670> the<00:01:28.850> same<00:01:29.090> way<00:01:32.230> and<00:01:34.090> the<00:01:35.090> next<00:01:35.420> thing

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
quarters the same way and the next thing

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.540 
quarters the same way and the next thing
you<00:01:35.810> do<00:01:36.020> once<00:01:36.470> you<00:01:36.590> have<00:01:36.650> typed<00:01:36.980> all<00:01:37.250> four

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
you do once you have typed all four

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.520 
you do once you have typed all four
quarters<00:01:37.880> together<00:01:38.180> and<00:01:38.840> you<00:01:38.930> have<00:01:39.080> a<00:01:39.110> square

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
quarters together and you have a square

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.520 
quarters together and you have a square
it<00:01:40.310> may<00:01:40.550> not<00:01:40.760> be<00:01:40.970> sitting<00:01:41.180> exactly<00:01:41.510> squares<00:01:42.320> or

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
it may not be sitting exactly squares or

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.800 
it may not be sitting exactly squares or
perpendicular<00:01:43.190> in<00:01:43.310> every<00:01:43.550> port<00:01:43.820> well<00:01:44.600> the

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
perpendicular in every port well the

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.470 
perpendicular in every port well the
easiest<00:01:45.230> ways<00:01:45.590> to<00:01:45.620> do<00:01:46.160> that<00:01:46.370> is<00:01:46.670> to<00:01:47.270> take<00:01:47.420> a

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:47.480 
easiest ways to do that is to take a

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.110 
easiest ways to do that is to take a
tape<00:01:47.810> measure<00:01:47.840> I<00:01:48.680> have<00:01:49.430> somebody<00:01:49.670> help<00:01:50.060> you

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.120 
tape measure I have somebody help you

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.980 
tape measure I have somebody help you
and<00:01:50.600> go<00:01:51.590> for<00:01:51.830> one<00:01:52.070> corner<00:01:52.580> to<00:01:52.810> the<00:01:53.810> other

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
and go for one corner to the other

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.520 
and go for one corner to the other
corner<00:01:54.170> diagonal<00:01:55.100> and<00:01:55.310> make<00:01:56.180> sure<00:01:56.540> that<00:01:57.320> your

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
corner diagonal and make sure that your

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.680 
corner diagonal and make sure that your
distances<00:01:58.130> are<00:01:58.280> exactly<00:01:58.700> the<00:01:58.880> same<00:01:59.000> in<00:01:59.570> my

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
distances are exactly the same in my

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.469 
distances are exactly the same in my
case<00:02:00.260> this<00:02:00.500> is<00:02:00.560> now<00:02:00.860> like<00:02:01.430> nine<00:02:01.729> feet<00:02:02.119> now

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
case this is now like nine feet now

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.330 
case this is now like nine feet now
treat<00:02:02.869> you<00:02:03.020> I'm<00:02:03.350> telling<00:02:03.800> you<00:02:03.830> be<00:02:03.979> are<00:02:04.070> they<00:02:04.190> up

treat you I'm telling you be are they up
outside<00:02:04.820> nine<00:02:05.360> feet<00:02:05.660> a<00:02:05.810> little<00:02:05.990> bit<00:02:06.229> over<00:02:06.410> nine

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
outside nine feet a little bit over nine

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.190 
outside nine feet a little bit over nine
feet<00:02:06.590> and<00:02:06.979> we<00:02:07.790> go<00:02:07.940> to<00:02:08.000> the<00:02:08.179> other<00:02:08.300> corner<00:02:08.420> and

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
feet and we go to the other corner and

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.790 
feet and we go to the other corner and
tighten<00:02:09.679> see<00:02:10.250> you<00:02:10.340> with<00:02:10.490> the<00:02:10.610> same<00:02:11.030> distance

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
tighten see you with the same distance

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.930 
tighten see you with the same distance
no<00:02:12.800> I<00:02:13.180> am<00:02:14.180> 106<00:02:14.930> hundred<00:02:15.290> and<00:02:15.440> six<00:02:15.590> inches<00:02:15.830> so<00:02:16.280> we

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
no I am 106 hundred and six inches so we

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.030 
no I am 106 hundred and six inches so we
need<00:02:17.090> to<00:02:17.180> adjust<00:02:17.410> so<00:02:18.410> I'm<00:02:18.500> making<00:02:18.680> this<00:02:18.980> a

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
need to adjust so I'm making this a

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.120 
need to adjust so I'm making this a
little<00:02:19.340> bit<00:02:19.610> now<00:02:20.060> that<00:02:20.090> this<00:02:20.330> is<00:02:20.510> 107<00:02:21.320> go<00:02:21.920> back

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
little bit now that this is 107 go back

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.250 
little bit now that this is 107 go back
to<00:02:22.310> the<00:02:22.459> outside<00:02:24.910> and<00:02:25.910> I'm<00:02:26.120> 102<00:02:26.630> seven<00:02:26.989> again

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
to the outside and I'm 102 seven again

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.330 
to the outside and I'm 102 seven again
so<00:02:27.830> we<00:02:27.950> were<00:02:28.070> lucky<00:02:28.250> -<00:02:28.790> 107<00:02:29.600> 106<00:02:30.470> by<00:02:30.709> six<00:02:30.980> from

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
so we were lucky - 107 106 by six from

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.509 
so we were lucky - 107 106 by six from
each<00:02:31.519> corner<00:02:31.760> to<00:02:32.000> each<00:02:32.150> corner<00:02:32.480> and<00:02:33.340> next<00:02:34.340> step

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
each corner to each corner and next step

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.090 
each corner to each corner and next step
is<00:02:34.700> to<00:02:35.180> lift<00:02:35.480> up<00:02:35.690> your<00:02:35.959> greenhouse<00:02:36.260> frame<00:02:36.769> and

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
is to lift up your greenhouse frame and

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.830 
is to lift up your greenhouse frame and
put<00:02:37.370> it<00:02:37.459> on<00:02:37.580> top<00:02:37.790> of<00:02:37.940> it<00:02:38.060> which<00:02:38.330> we<00:02:38.510> don't<00:02:38.750> like

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
put it on top of it which we don't like

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.530 
put it on top of it which we don't like
we<00:02:39.290> take<00:02:39.560> up<00:02:39.739> two<00:02:40.130> of<00:02:40.220> us<00:02:40.400> taking<00:02:41.269> up<00:02:41.390> the

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
we take up two of us taking up the

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.860 
we take up two of us taking up the
greenhouse<00:02:41.900> frame<00:02:42.260> and<00:02:43.030> we<00:02:44.030> carefully<00:02:44.450> set<00:02:44.720> it

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
greenhouse frame and we carefully set it

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.290 
greenhouse frame and we carefully set it
on<00:02:44.989> top<00:02:45.019> of<00:02:45.530> the<00:02:47.650> base<00:02:48.650> and<00:02:49.370> you<00:02:49.730> will<00:02:49.850> see<00:02:50.060> that

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
on top of the base and you will see that

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.930 
on top of the base and you will see that
there<00:02:50.600> is<00:02:50.630> a<00:02:50.720> lid<00:02:51.140> on<00:02:51.410> the<00:02:51.980> outside<00:02:52.550> of<00:02:52.730> each

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
there is a lid on the outside of each

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.900 
there is a lid on the outside of each
profile<00:02:53.660> which<00:02:54.290> can<00:02:54.500> sit<00:02:54.739> nicely<00:02:55.070> just<00:02:55.640> on<00:02:55.790> the

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
profile which can sit nicely just on the

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.110 
profile which can sit nicely just on the
outside<00:02:56.330> of<00:02:56.630> the<00:02:57.170> frame<00:02:57.410> the<00:02:58.370> next<00:02:58.670> thing<00:02:58.940> is

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
outside of the frame the next thing is

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.020 
outside of the frame the next thing is
unfortunately<00:03:00.050> what<00:03:00.769> you<00:03:00.800> have<00:03:01.220> to<00:03:01.459> do<00:03:01.640> is

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
unfortunately what you have to do is

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.360 
unfortunately what you have to do is
you're<00:03:02.870> going<00:03:03.019> to<00:03:03.110> have<00:03:03.290> to<00:03:03.500> use<00:03:03.709> these<00:03:03.980> clips

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
you're going to have to use these clips

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.640 
you're going to have to use these clips
that<00:03:04.610> you<00:03:04.760> have<00:03:04.970> these<00:03:05.150> little<00:03:05.209> L<00:03:05.600> shapes<00:03:05.989> to

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
that you have these little L shapes to

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.000 
that you have these little L shapes to
tighten<00:03:07.220> the<00:03:07.970> frame<00:03:08.299> to<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:08.870> base<00:03:09.049> the<00:03:09.799> way<00:03:09.950> to

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
tighten the frame to the base the way to

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.060 
tighten the frame to the base the way to
do<00:03:10.340> that<00:03:10.519> is<00:03:10.880> if<00:03:11.239> you<00:03:11.330> have<00:03:11.570> to<00:03:11.780> loosen<00:03:12.080> up<00:03:12.410> all

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
do that is if you have to loosen up all

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.380 
do that is if you have to loosen up all
these<00:03:14.350> bolts<00:03:15.350> so<00:03:16.070> if<00:03:16.340> you<00:03:16.760> have<00:03:16.970> tightened

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
these bolts so if you have tightened

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.080 
these bolts so if you have tightened
them<00:03:17.560> going<00:03:18.560> to<00:03:18.620> have<00:03:18.769> to<00:03:18.890> take<00:03:19.040> a<00:03:19.100> loose

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
them going to have to take a loose

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.030 
them going to have to take a loose
so<00:03:21.709> just<00:03:22.709> take<00:03:23.250> all<00:03:23.520> of<00:03:23.550> these<00:03:24.380> that<00:03:25.380> is<00:03:25.560> over

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
so just take all of these that is over

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.979 
so just take all of these that is over
actually<00:03:26.670> you<00:03:26.760> have<00:03:26.910> to<00:03:27.030> go<00:03:27.150> underneath<00:03:27.540> first

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
actually you have to go underneath first

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.150 
actually you have to go underneath first
hook<00:03:28.290> it<00:03:28.530> to<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.599> foundation<00:03:30.599> frame<00:03:31.260> like

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
hook it to the foundation frame like

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.790 
hook it to the foundation frame like
this<00:03:32.430> and<00:03:32.730> the<00:03:33.150> tension<00:03:33.599> so<00:03:34.230> we'll<00:03:34.410> do<00:03:34.590> all

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
this and the tension so we'll do all

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
this and the tension so we'll do all
these<00:03:35.040> and<00:03:36.030> then<00:03:36.120> we'll<00:03:36.239> get<00:03:36.420> back<00:03:36.569> to<00:03:36.750> you
