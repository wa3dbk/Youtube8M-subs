00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.609 
ever tried it so it works out pretty
good<00:02:09.119> I<00:02:09.149> used<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.509> do<00:02:09.629> it<00:02:09.780> with<00:02:09.959> two<00:02:10.020> and<00:02:10.410> a<00:02:10.440> half

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
good I used to do it with two and a half

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.140 
good I used to do it with two and a half
to<00:02:10.860> three<00:02:10.890> cups<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:11.520> it<00:02:11.640> just<00:02:11.819> didn't<00:02:12.030> have

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
to three cups and it just didn't have

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.430 
to three cups and it just didn't have
enough<00:02:12.180> punch

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
enough punch

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.320 
enough punch

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
so now that I use four cups it seems

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.720
