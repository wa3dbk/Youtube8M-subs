you'll<00:02:30.440> add<00:02:30.620> a<00:02:30.650> little<00:02:30.920> bit<00:02:31.040> of<00:02:31.129> white<00:02:31.370> to<00:02:31.640> it

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
you'll add a little bit of white to it

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.150 
you'll add a little bit of white to it
okay<00:02:34.400> if<00:02:34.580> I<00:02:34.640> get<00:02:34.819> too<00:02:35.120> much<00:02:35.269> paint<00:02:36.040> what<00:02:37.040> I<00:02:37.069> do

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
okay if I get too much paint what I do

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.949 
okay if I get too much paint what I do
is<00:02:37.340> I<00:02:37.459> wipe<00:02:37.700> my<00:02:37.910> brush<00:02:38.120> off<00:02:38.360> you<00:02:38.629> don't<00:02:38.750> want<00:02:38.810> it

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
is I wipe my brush off you don't want it

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.300 
is I wipe my brush off you don't want it
to<00:02:39.019> be<00:02:39.140> really<00:02:39.290> strong<00:02:39.709> and<00:02:40.670> then<00:02:41.980> you<00:02:42.980> kind<00:02:43.220> of

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
to be really strong and then you kind of

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:49.430 
to be really strong and then you kind of
spread<00:02:43.700> it<00:02:43.790> out

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.890 

and<00:02:49.890> blend<00:02:50.250> it<00:02:50.370> in<00:02:50.550> together<00:02:50.760> okay<00:02:53.630> so<00:02:54.630> we<00:02:54.780> have

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
and blend it in together okay so we have

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.600 
and blend it in together okay so we have
a<00:02:54.930> little<00:02:55.140> bit<00:02:55.290> of<00:02:55.410> purple<00:02:55.800> showing<00:02:56.370> there

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
a little bit of purple showing there

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.550 
a little bit of purple showing there
then<00:02:57.480> what<00:02:57.690> I'm<00:02:57.750> going<00:02:57.870> to<00:02:57.930> do<00:02:58.110> is<00:02:58.290> take<00:02:58.530> a

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
then what I'm going to do is take a

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:11.130 
then what I'm going to do is take a
little<00:02:58.860> bit<00:02:58.950> of<00:02:59.010> white<00:03:01.760> yellow<00:03:02.760> ochre

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.330 

kind<00:03:11.680> of<00:03:11.830> complement<00:03:12.460> the<00:03:12.700> purple<00:03:13.090> over<00:03:13.870> here

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
kind of complement the purple over here

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:20.880 
kind of complement the purple over here
next<00:03:15.340> to<00:03:15.430> that<00:03:18.870> okay<00:03:19.870> the<00:03:20.020> more<00:03:20.230> water<00:03:20.500> you<00:03:20.650> use

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
next to that okay the more water you use

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.040 
next to that okay the more water you use
the<00:03:21.700> thinner<00:03:21.940> the<00:03:22.150> paint<00:03:22.390> will<00:03:22.510> be<00:03:22.660> and<00:03:22.930> the

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
the thinner the paint will be and the

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.020 
the thinner the paint will be and the
more<00:03:23.260> subtle<00:03:23.560> will<00:03:23.860> be<00:03:24.010> just<00:03:24.310> kind<00:03:24.490> of<00:03:24.580> kind<00:03:24.940> of

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
more subtle will be just kind of kind of

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.150 
more subtle will be just kind of kind of
like<00:03:25.150> the<00:03:25.390> subtle<00:03:26.200> shadows<00:03:26.740> we<00:03:26.980> made

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
like the subtle shadows we made

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.020 
like the subtle shadows we made
yesterday<00:03:27.780> so<00:03:28.780> here's<00:03:29.560> another<00:03:29.770> example<00:03:30.400> I'll

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
yesterday so here's another example I'll

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.290 
yesterday so here's another example I'll
take<00:03:31.210> some<00:03:31.450> burnt<00:03:31.690> sienna<00:03:32.670> we'll<00:03:33.670> yell<00:03:33.820> ochre

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
take some burnt sienna we'll yell ochre

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.000 
take some burnt sienna we'll yell ochre
which<00:03:34.480> will<00:03:34.600> kind<00:03:34.720> of<00:03:34.840> make<00:03:34.990> an<00:03:35.470> orangish

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
which will kind of make an orangish

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.420 
which will kind of make an orangish
color<00:03:37.320> I'll<00:03:38.320> put<00:03:38.560> a<00:03:38.590> little<00:03:38.740> spot<00:03:39.010> on<00:03:39.070> there

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
color I'll put a little spot on there

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:46.470 
color I'll put a little spot on there
wipe<00:03:39.670> my<00:03:39.820> brush<00:03:40.030> off<00:03:44.730> and<00:03:45.730> kind<00:03:45.970> of<00:03:46.060> blend<00:03:46.330> it

in

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.830 

I'll<00:03:58.520> tell<00:03:58.700> you<00:03:58.760> a<00:03:58.819> little<00:03:58.910> bit<00:03:59.120> of<00:03:59.180> white<00:03:59.450> to

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
I'll tell you a little bit of white to

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:07.839 
I'll tell you a little bit of white to
lighten<00:04:00.080> it<00:04:00.200> up

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:07.849 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:15.280 

another<00:04:08.420> thing<00:04:08.689> about<00:04:08.720> using<00:04:09.379> the<00:04:09.760> subtle<00:04:14.290> by

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
another thing about using the subtle by

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.939 
another thing about using the subtle by
creating<00:04:16.280> a<00:04:16.340> lot<00:04:16.489> of<00:04:16.780> moisture<00:04:17.780> on<00:04:18.199> the<00:04:18.350> canvas

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:18.949 
creating a lot of moisture on the canvas

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:22.900 
creating a lot of moisture on the canvas
and<00:04:19.160> then<00:04:19.250> on<00:04:19.400> your<00:04:19.549> pallet<00:04:19.970> you<00:04:21.550> get<00:04:22.550> a<00:04:22.580> lot<00:04:22.820> of

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
and then on your pallet you get a lot of

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.480 
and then on your pallet you get a lot of
transparencies<00:04:23.810> so<00:04:24.500> the<00:04:24.680> more<00:04:24.830> you<00:04:24.949> layer<00:04:25.220> the

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
transparencies so the more you layer the

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.960 
transparencies so the more you layer the
paint<00:04:25.760> the<00:04:26.510> more<00:04:26.830> you<00:04:27.830> get<00:04:28.039> all<00:04:28.520> of<00:04:28.880> these

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
paint the more you get all of these

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.520 
paint the more you get all of these
colors<00:04:29.300> showing<00:04:29.810> through<00:04:30.139> and<00:04:30.169> you<00:04:30.380> get<00:04:30.470> a

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
colors showing through and you get a

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.330 
colors showing through and you get a
really<00:04:31.010> nice<00:04:31.900> luminous<00:04:32.900> atmospheric<00:04:33.800> type<00:04:34.130> of

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
really nice luminous atmospheric type of

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.510 
really nice luminous atmospheric type of
sky<00:04:34.639> a<00:04:35.600> lot<00:04:36.260> of<00:04:36.350> times<00:04:36.560> when<00:04:37.340> you're<00:04:37.460> working

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
sky a lot of times when you're working

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.779 
sky a lot of times when you're working
on<00:04:37.760> the<00:04:37.880> skies<00:04:38.090> a<00:04:38.120> lot<00:04:38.449> of<00:04:38.510> people<00:04:38.690> just<00:04:38.810> paint

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:39.789 
on the skies a lot of people just paint

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:42.850 
on the skies a lot of people just paint
one<00:04:40.789> color<00:04:41.060> in<00:04:41.330> and<00:04:41.600> then<00:04:41.720> don't<00:04:42.289> work<00:04:42.470> layers

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
one color in and then don't work layers

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.700 
one color in and then don't work layers
on<00:04:43.190> top<00:04:43.220> of<00:04:43.460> it<00:04:43.729> all<00:04:44.360> right<00:04:44.449> which<00:04:44.750> is<00:04:44.900> okay<00:04:45.229> you

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
on top of it all right which is okay you

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.180 
on top of it all right which is okay you
can<00:04:45.740> do<00:04:46.070> that<00:04:46.600> but<00:04:47.620> if<00:04:48.620> you<00:04:48.770> want<00:04:48.889> to<00:04:49.039> get

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
can do that but if you want to get

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.370 
can do that but if you want to get
something<00:04:49.580> that<00:04:49.669> has<00:04:49.850> a<00:04:50.210> lot<00:04:50.810> of<00:04:50.840> depth<00:04:51.760> to<00:04:52.760> it

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
something that has a lot of depth to it

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.980 
something that has a lot of depth to it
you<00:04:54.380> want<00:04:54.530> to<00:04:54.680> layer<00:04:54.919> a<00:04:55.449> lot<00:04:56.449> of<00:04:56.630> thin

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
you want to layer a lot of thin

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.150 
you want to layer a lot of thin
transparent<00:04:57.590> colors<00:04:58.400> so<00:04:59.150> you<00:04:59.210> get<00:04:59.449> that<00:04:59.660> more

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
transparent colors so you get that more

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.370 
transparent colors so you get that more
luminous<00:05:01.160> look<00:05:01.400> to<00:05:01.580> it<00:05:01.729> okay<00:05:02.720> so<00:05:02.780> I<00:05:02.930> put<00:05:03.020> in<00:05:03.289> a

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
luminous look to it okay so I put in a

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.460 
luminous look to it okay so I put in a
little<00:05:03.500> bit<00:05:03.740> of<00:05:03.770> my<00:05:04.990> orangish<00:05:05.990> color<00:05:06.020> over

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
little bit of my orangish color over

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.230 
little bit of my orangish color over
here<00:05:06.550> then<00:05:07.550> I'll<00:05:07.639> take<00:05:07.850> a<00:05:07.880> little<00:05:08.000> bit<00:05:08.150> of

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
here then I'll take a little bit of

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:14.620 
here then I'll take a little bit of
cobalt<00:05:09.020> teal<00:05:12.639> and<00:05:13.639> since<00:05:13.910> that<00:05:14.030> has<00:05:14.240> a<00:05:14.270> bluish

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
cobalt teal and since that has a bluish

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.589 
cobalt teal and since that has a bluish
tone<00:05:15.050> to<00:05:15.380> it<00:05:15.430> it<00:05:16.430> kind<00:05:16.729> of<00:05:16.820> complements<00:05:17.449> this

00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:17.599 
tone to it it kind of complements this

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:20.710 
tone to it it kind of complements this
orange<00:05:18.370> and<00:05:19.370> as<00:05:19.729> you<00:05:19.849> can<00:05:19.970> see<00:05:20.150> I<00:05:20.180> just<00:05:20.330> do

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
orange and as you can see I just do

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:26.680 
orange and as you can see I just do
really<00:05:20.990> thin<00:05:21.910> layers<00:05:25.270> okay<00:05:26.270> and<00:05:26.449> then<00:05:26.570> we<00:05:26.660> can

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.690 
really thin layers okay and then we can
