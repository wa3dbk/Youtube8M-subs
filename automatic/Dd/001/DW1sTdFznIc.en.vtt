00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.860
 that it has fallen 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.560

 point you're not just flipping around muscles and 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:19.650
 to strengthen all that and who says we would 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.940
 sport also says we eat so much 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.760

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:54.539

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:25.360
 much better than eating I know 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:30.370

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.190
 because I too abundant 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.500
 we are open national develops early 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.780
 March has since posted a 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:52.120

 experience about once a year I 

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:20.560
 buy this thing there that what 

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.480
 is that you are a little scared actually 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.970
 it drops riscle where the 

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:27.760

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:39.639
 it calms me and it allows me to better 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:44.259
