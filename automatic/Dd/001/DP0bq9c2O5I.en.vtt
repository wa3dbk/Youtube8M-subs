was<00:01:33.950> tough<00:01:34.130> to<00:01:34.460> begin<00:01:34.700> with<00:01:34.880> but<00:01:35.149> actually<00:01:35.600> in

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
was tough to begin with but actually in

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.320 
was tough to begin with but actually in
terms<00:01:35.990> of<00:01:36.080> when<00:01:36.229> you<00:01:36.289> start<00:01:36.530> thinking<00:01:36.679> of<00:01:37.330> how

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
terms of when you start thinking of how

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.950 
terms of when you start thinking of how
the<00:01:39.310> high-fat<00:01:40.310> the<00:01:40.819> low-carb<00:01:41.299> it<00:01:41.659> actually

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
makes sense and it's something that i

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.350 
makes sense and it's something that i
enjoyed<00:01:45.350> we're<00:01:45.649> not<00:01:45.830> first<00:01:46.039> bit<00:01:46.280> but<00:01:46.759> as<00:01:47.149> it's
