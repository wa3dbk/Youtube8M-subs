00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
come up off the bottom of the pan hit it

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:17.680 
come up off the bottom of the pan hit it
with<00:05:11.640> my<00:05:11.669> maple<00:05:12.300> syrup

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:22.040 

and<00:05:18.690> again<00:05:19.080> mix<00:05:19.680> all<00:05:19.919> that<00:05:20.360> together<00:05:21.360> and<00:05:21.840> let

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
and again mix all that together and let

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.100 
and again mix all that together and let
it<00:05:22.229> let<00:05:22.740> it<00:05:22.860> reduce<00:05:23.160> down<00:05:23.220> again<00:05:23.880> by<00:05:24.840> about<00:05:25.050> a

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
it let it reduce down again by about a

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:28.879 
it let it reduce down again by about a
quarter<00:05:25.590> to<00:05:26.070> a<00:05:26.100> third<00:05:26.220> and<00:05:27.560> you<00:05:28.560> know<00:05:28.650> is<00:05:28.740> that

00:05:28.879 --> 00:05:28.889 
quarter to a third and you know is that

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:31.550 
quarter to a third and you know is that
sugar<00:05:29.300> cooks<00:05:30.300> down<00:05:30.479> and<00:05:30.720> caramelize<00:05:31.169> it'll

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
sugar cooks down and caramelize it'll

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.960 
sugar cooks down and caramelize it'll
get<00:05:31.740> increasingly<00:05:32.400> thicker<00:05:32.759> a<00:05:34.550> little<00:05:35.550> too

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:35.970 
get increasingly thicker a little too

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.620 
get increasingly thicker a little too
thick<00:05:36.240> for<00:05:36.270> a<00:05:36.539> first<00:05:37.500> sauce<00:05:37.710> all<00:05:38.070> on<00:05:38.250> its<00:05:38.370> own

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
thick for a first sauce all on its own

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:44.080 
thick for a first sauce all on its own
so<00:05:39.630> I've<00:05:39.720> also<00:05:39.930> got<00:05:40.289> a<00:05:41.419> little<00:05:42.419> bit<00:05:42.660> of<00:05:42.750> stock

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090 
so I've also got a little bit of stock

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.240 
so I've also got a little bit of stock
chicken<00:05:45.090> stock<00:05:45.270> which<00:05:45.660> I'm<00:05:45.780> going<00:05:45.930> to<00:05:45.990> add<00:05:46.250> to

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
chicken stock which I'm going to add to

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:57.030 
chicken stock which I'm going to add to
finish<00:05:47.610> off<00:05:47.789> our<00:05:48.229> sauce

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:57.040 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.610 

and<00:05:58.510> then<00:05:59.510> again<00:05:59.780> this<00:05:59.960> is<00:06:00.110> going<00:06:00.200> to<00:06:00.260> reduce

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:00.620 
and then again this is going to reduce

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.050 
and then again this is going to reduce
down<00:06:00.860> to<00:06:02.620> probably<00:06:03.620> half<00:06:03.830> the<00:06:04.060> consistency

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:05.060 
down to probably half the consistency

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.280 
down to probably half the consistency
here<00:06:05.300> you<00:06:05.420> on<00:06:05.540> a<00:06:05.570> nice<00:06:06.520> you<00:06:07.520> know<00:06:07.550> a<00:06:07.640> nice<00:06:07.820> sauce

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:08.290 
here you on a nice you know a nice sauce

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:11.920 
here you on a nice you know a nice sauce
consistency<00:06:09.820> and<00:06:10.820> once<00:06:11.000> it<00:06:11.180> once<00:06:11.540> it's<00:06:11.720> down
