00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.080
 I have there behind 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:31.840
 let's make some stuffed meatballs 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.590
 with quail egg a little sauce 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.059
 onion and we 're going to put on our boots 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.050
 because simpler thing imagines that 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:43.190
 there is no 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:46.760
 look at the meat I have put 70% of 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:49.699
 minced pork and 30% meat 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.559
 chopped veal I added an egg and 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:53.059
 of put a few spices a 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.670
 little garlic powder little parsley 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:01:00.470
 and a little bit of white pepper with that 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:02.420
 I'm going to stir it well and travel it 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.400
 resting approximately one hour to 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.159
 that takes flavor and from there it starts 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.580
 to make the rest of the dish until 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:12.650
 so 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.650
 I say goodbye to you guys 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.540
 well as you can see we have here 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.270
 all prepared I'm making the sauce 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.340
 with half c / v and three cloves of garlic 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.590
 put a little oil in the pan and 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.270
 Now when it's fried, the onion and 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.890
 I'm going to add a little flour 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.520
 I'm going to pass it through the blender to 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:37.360
 make a thick sauce like 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:39.070
 You see my wife is already putting the 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.530
 quail eggs surrounding them with the 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.110
 minced meat that has already spent one hour 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.750
 since I made the deal and has already taken 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.670
 the corresponding flavor now when 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.910
 let's have all the facts done 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:55.390
 balls what I will do is pass them by 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:57.850
 flour and fry them and when you have the 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.979
 sauce made since the join the two 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.259
 things and I'll leave them salsa concert 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.539
 for a little while to take the flavor 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:07.090
 all those steps are the ones that you are going to go 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:09.970
 seeing and now simply 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.470
 As you can see I 'm going to focus a little more 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.220
 see if I can do it without it moving 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:16.090
 a lot of the camera 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.890
 so you can see how 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:22.110
 it does 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.110
 what to put the egg inside the face 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.500
 As you can see, it is not very complicated either 

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:30.700
 take a ball of meat the egg is put 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:33.790
 in the center, Qatar is well surrounded 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.829
 close the ball and then you know already in 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.689
 our steps good then when 

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:42.000
 let's start when we're seeing the 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:45.630
 school and aimed to make the sauce we go back 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:49.340
 Well, I already have the 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.340
 meatball is suffering 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:59.099
 and now it is written until leaving them to a 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:03:01.170
 70 80 percent because then on the tour 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:03.540
 sauce to which I have already contributed the flour 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.970
 and you see it's from fried egypt the one 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.020
 I'm going to start 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:10.190
 to be treated 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:13.690
 written the flour and has bathed the water 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.690
 and a pinch of salt 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:21.060
 Well now with this and that puts a 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.799
 little more water in it the 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.920
 steps through the blender and left a sauce 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:28.680
 but where will I go putting the meatballs 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:31.799
 I'll be right back 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:35.640
 Well, these ones I have and Africa and 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:37.549
 how directly it was sauce in the 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.709
 court that had not been said I put 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:42.420
 a broth light living pill 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.430
 starlux meat that will give me a 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.829
 organic flavor and now 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.360
 I just have to take these that I 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:54.330
 remain 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:56.430
 passed by marine flour 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:59.210
 shake them a little so that they fall 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.210
 the remaining flour 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:05.000
 and put them to fry and this is all 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:07.730
 process in which they are made I put them 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.099
 along with the others and the ways in the 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:16.039
 sauce about 15 minutes 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:18.289
 doing with the sauce so that it 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:20.930
 more juicy and limping the taste of 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:23.900
 the sauce and contribute will also bring 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.780
 some flavor to it when you have 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.410
 all this all this good as 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.590
 we 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:35.220
 Well, how can you see this and what 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:37.650
 I have done waiting to leave it 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:41.220
 rest a little while the sauce then I will 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:45.630
 some chips and this is going to be a 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:48.150
 splendid dinner with four meatballs 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:51.150

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.910

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.690
 end of the plate 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:59.780
 good and as you can see it turns out that 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:03.350
 meatballs these who had the little egg 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:05.480
 of quail inside they have left the 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.550
 nest and they have opened and they have not left 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:10.010
 quail it turns out that the 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.800

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:18.770

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:23.110
