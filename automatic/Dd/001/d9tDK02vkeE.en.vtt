00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.220

 mauri shoes dylan but with 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.740
 however, it already boasts collaborations 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.330
 look with artists from the pop scene 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.010

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.750

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.960

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.540

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.400
 games 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.400
 it makes me feel good to cry 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.049
 this time the song 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.470
 it's all OK 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.960
 there are things that will be perfect 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.160
 a fact like that 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:28.400
 lugano that does not end as barbie 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:31.180
 bare and the helmet requirement mini cooper 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.180
 of the cane 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.510

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:25.299

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:29.830
 step come here come here you were 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:32.340
 very young wild and free joy wild and 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.340
 free 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.250
 x compliments soon will be the time 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.709
 of the verdict a true verdict 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.110
 complicated because it will have to do without 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.760
 one of these two guys ask 

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.920
 raffaella I saw very amused 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.650
 from this performance what do you think 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:55.000
 of these two boys but why not 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:57.549
 they really do freestyle this more 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.769
 style on television is not understood 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:01.769
 fantastic we are working for this 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:10.900
 you really are the show the sense 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:14.590
 of rhythm minus your horse gods 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:18.549
 pants that really the problem is of 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:20.340
 fashion from but I don't like but apart 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:23.710
 this is a detail and playful 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:27.940
 really terrific good ceac why 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:29.530
 it takes degree designers 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.870
 I play a lot because I am also the fact 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.400
 that the investee was written by 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.340
 they were Italian because in reality 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:39.070
 a rapper without his words does not exist 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.800
 in short, I don't remember both of them 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.870
 ivan i remember your freestyle at e 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.970
 blind that was not really a 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:49.720
 memorable freestyle 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:51.880
 but this evening you have shown that you have 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.700
 the two words in my opinion this 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:57.850
 this is something that makes you touch us 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:00.280
 Case single later that the verdict 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:03.400
 I imagine it to be really difficult 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:05.770
 actually a certain type of communication 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:11.380
 of language in Italy rap rock satire 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:12.040
 and journalism and has been suffering for years 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.370
 censorship 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.570
 ok at this point people are leaving 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.460
 to look for alone thankfully thanks 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:21.130
 to the network in the last 10 15 years the rap 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.930
 had a popular boom because of the media 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:26.740
 they couldn't stop it anymore this is 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:28.360
 practically successful this success in 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.300
 Italy 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.880
 now we have had two approaches to rap 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.790
 completely different we had a 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:40.360
 approach to rap more classic than that 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:44.580
 of dylan and a more melodic approach e 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.580
 that of ivan 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:52.860
 you are already ahead 

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:53.580
 you have a career already started more than that 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.500
 of others 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.500
 but the voice will carry on dylan 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:08.920
 goes on with bones j ax compliments of 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:11.910
 Count see you at the lockout 

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.910
