00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:07.740
 road safety is a very broad theme 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.110
 and depends on many factors between 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.950
 them the technology available in our 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.780
 cars 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.599
 but the good news is that Brazil comes 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.130
 gaining investment in this sector 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.410
 the result of a more 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.140
 conscious with greater purchasing power 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.600
 so much so that we now have some resources in 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.910
 cars here in Brazil that previously only 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.910
 were available on models out there 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.969
 security systems normally 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.160
 into three categories those 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.010
 take action to avoid a collision 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.559
 those that guarantee more comfort for the 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.350
 driver and those who work for 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:58.590
 reduce damage to passengers in the event 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:01:00.989
 an accident in the group of those who avoid 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.300
 collision detection system 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.210
 pedestrians may be what most calls 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.850
 thanks to the inventiveness of the 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.030
 engineers in brazil he is already 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.890
 present in volvo ver 40 for example 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:16.439
 works like this with a series of sensors 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.369
 that detect the presence of objects or 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.619
 people 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.409
 the vehicle is able to stop completely 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.310
 even if the driver does not start the pedal 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.409
 of the brake 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.780
 remembering that this happens when 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.979
 Car speed is up to 40 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.979
 kilometers per hour 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:40.730
 Another increasingly common feature is 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.490
 which alerts the driver to the blind area 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:46.430
 of the side mirrors with a small 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.260
 led flashing on external mirrors 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.760
 it warns of the presence of something that comes 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.250
 right behind 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.590
 very simple but that receives variations 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.680
 with the same purpose in the case of honda 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.720
 cuts a camera in the right 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.970
 connected to the center panel of the car 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:06.550
 as soon as the arrow is pressed 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.550
 you can see on the big screen a much larger area 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.950
 if the trip is tiring the driver 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.390
 you start to feel sleepy and you may lose 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.660
 car control 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.510
 for this there is the fatigue sensor that 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.520
 perceives a more unstable direction and 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.190
 sound warning advises the driver 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:30.860
 that stop for a coffee 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.709
 but if the driver is stubborn and the driver 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.200
 car out of the way there is already another 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:39.370
 system that makes the correction 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.370
 steering wheel in the right direction 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.900
 it is worth remembering that there are still those 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:50.690
 technologies that make life easier for those who 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.100
 because they offer more comfort in 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.220
 some situations 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:58.250
 one of them is the park assist that is able to 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.709
 identify an available position and make the 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.110
 beacon for the driver there is also the 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.450
 starting assistant ramp here already 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.310
 available until the new party and that 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.200
 Hold the brake for a few seconds. 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.530
 When are we going to go out with the car? 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.530
 slope 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.599
 but still in depth on the issue of 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.550
 security system has an ac system that 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:25.580
 people in that situation where the car 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.650
 almost does everything alone is the city 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.870
 it is mainly used for traffic 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.580
 heavy slow of a big city 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.110
 I can by means of buttons here 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.970
 determine the speed I want 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.140
 walking and the distance I want to keep 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.850
 a front-end vehicle 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.739
 Our team car is here at 

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:42.650
 front I determined a speed 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:45.080
 maximum of 60 km per hour and at a distance 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.180
 the front of the car then see that 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:47.930
 it maintains the speed according to the 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.700
 Traffic 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:52.850
 accelerating and braking if the car 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:55.549
 front for him to too and even if 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.380
 all this is not enough enters into 

00:03:55.549 --> 00:04:00.140
 one of the last categories of 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.600
 safety devices to those who 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.150
 reduces the damage to those inside the 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:08.569
 car in a most popular collision of them 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.010
 is the air bag now in greater quantity and 

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:11.989
 in different points 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.069
 the latest is the air bag for 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.920
 pedestrians 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:19.039
 already available on volvo ver 40 sold on 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:22.220
 brazil in case of collision the cover of the 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:24.500
 hood and slightly open and the airbag 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.470
 open to reduce the impact of 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.060
 pedestrian against the car is unfortunately 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.979
 can not fail to comment that the 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.200
 majority of these items are still 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:35.630
 exclusivity of much more expensive cars 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:37.700
 but we've already taken a step 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:39.020
 ahead mainly with the new law 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:41.660
 which forces all cars 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.039
 produced in Brazil have the airbag 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.050
 brakes with abs 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:47.870
 but it really is an exercise to 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.400
 values ​​are quite these items and the 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:53.440
 put on your priority list 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.440
 when to change a car
