if you want to download it and build on

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.660 
if you want to download it and build on

it for yourself check out my last video
or<00:00:24.140> one<00:00:25.140> of<00:00:25.260> them<00:00:25.410> not<00:00:26.250> sure<00:00:26.430> but<00:00:26.640> so<00:00:27.570> basically

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
or one of them not sure but so basically

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.779 
or one of them not sure but so basically
this<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.560> outside<00:00:28.949> I'll<00:00:29.400> show<00:00:29.609> you<00:00:29.699> guys

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
this is the outside I'll show you guys

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.080 
this is the outside I'll show you guys
the<00:00:29.849> inside<00:00:30.119> in<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.810> second<00:00:31.759> you<00:00:32.759> know<00:00:32.880> just

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
the inside in a second you know just

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.910 
the inside in a second you know just
basically<00:00:33.780> what<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.230> was<00:00:34.290> going<00:00:34.500> for<00:00:34.559> was<00:00:34.739> a

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
basically what I was going for was a

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.040 
basically what I was going for was a
little<00:00:35.309> bit<00:00:35.399> of<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.610> segmented<00:00:36.420> structural

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
little bit of a segmented structural

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.490 
little bit of a segmented structural
design<00:00:38.660> repetitive<00:00:39.660> enough<00:00:39.899> so<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.110> it

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
design repetitive enough so that it

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.690 
design repetitive enough so that it
would<00:00:40.620> be<00:00:40.770> easy<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:41.190> recreate<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:43.700> hopefully

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
would be easy to recreate and hopefully

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.549 
would be easy to recreate and hopefully
I'll<00:00:44.850> have<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.030> tutorial<00:00:45.450> coming<00:00:45.899> up<00:00:45.989> in<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.530> bit

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
I'll have a tutorial coming up in a bit

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.910 
I'll have a tutorial coming up in a bit
I<00:00:46.829> just<00:00:46.860> really<00:00:47.760> want<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.030> show<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.180> guys<00:00:48.329> it

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
I just really want to show you guys it

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.220 
I just really want to show you guys it
so<00:00:49.920> if<00:00:50.730> we<00:00:50.969> head<00:00:51.059> inside<00:00:51.239> we<00:00:51.600> got<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.960> bit<00:00:52.140> of

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
so if we head inside we got a bit of

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.540 
so if we head inside we got a bit of
chest<00:00:52.500> space<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:54.530> the<00:00:55.530> top<00:00:55.710> ones<00:00:55.920> they<00:00:56.280> open

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
chest space and the top ones they open

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.029 
chest space and the top ones they open
because<00:00:56.850> these<00:00:57.090> are<00:00:57.239> slabs<00:00:58.140> hopefully

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
because these are slabs hopefully

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.060 
because these are slabs hopefully
they'll<00:00:59.190> keep<00:00:59.309> that<00:00:59.520> and<00:01:00.680> lock<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.859> show<00:01:02.010> you

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
they'll keep that and lock to show you

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.290 
they'll keep that and lock to show you
guys<00:01:02.370> this<00:01:02.820> now

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
but your figure over here we also have

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.480 
but your figure over here we also have
some<00:01:06.060> more<00:01:06.210> chests<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.170> we<00:01:07.710> have<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:08.189> couple

really carrying about you know
architecture<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:18.000> you're<00:01:18.119> more<00:01:18.650> hoping<00:01:19.650> to

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
architecture and you're more hoping to

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.890 
architecture and you're more hoping to
save<00:01:19.979> some<00:01:20.159> space<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:20.909> could<00:01:21.060> just<00:01:21.240> you

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
save some space and you could just you

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:22.850 
save some space and you could just you
know<00:01:21.990> get<00:01:22.170> rid<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.350> these<00:01:22.439> little<00:01:22.619> pillar

things and you know but I'm gonna put
those<00:01:26.580> back<00:01:26.790> after<00:01:27.540> roots<00:01:27.720> but<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:28.619> prefer<00:01:28.920> to

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
those back after roots but I prefer to

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.719 
those back after roots but I prefer to
have<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.220> large<00:01:30.409> so<00:01:31.409> head<00:01:31.590> up<00:01:31.680> here<00:01:31.920> we<00:01:32.579> got<00:01:32.700> a

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
have the large so head up here we got a

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.100 
have the large so head up here we got a
bed<00:01:33.020> some<00:01:34.020> more<00:01:34.200> storage<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.869> we're<00:01:36.869> on<00:01:36.990> that

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
bed some more storage and we're on that

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.649 
bed some more storage and we're on that
balcony<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:37.680> should<00:01:37.860> do<00:01:37.950> as<00:01:38.070> about<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:39.270> you

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
balcony that I should do as about so you

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.210 
balcony that I should do as about so you
know<00:01:39.780> interior<00:01:40.470> design<00:01:40.710> it's<00:01:40.950> all<00:01:40.979> about

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
know interior design it's all about

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.149 
know interior design it's all about
maintaining<00:01:41.990> the<00:01:42.990> structure<00:01:43.259> I<00:01:43.470> guess<00:01:43.740> and

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
maintaining the structure I guess and

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.859 
maintaining the structure I guess and
well<00:01:44.960> hopefully<00:01:45.960> preserving<00:01:46.560> some<00:01:46.740> space<00:01:47.869> now

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
well hopefully preserving some space now

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.050 
well hopefully preserving some space now
if<00:01:49.710> we<00:01:49.799> go<00:01:49.920> down<00:01:51.259> now<00:01:52.259> we're<00:01:52.530> gonna<00:01:52.619> head<00:01:53.060> this

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
if we go down now we're gonna head this

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.240 
if we go down now we're gonna head this
little<00:01:54.240> tower<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:55.320> guys<00:01:55.500> saw<00:01:55.770> on<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.920> outside

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
little tower you guys saw on the outside

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.459 
little tower you guys saw on the outside
so<00:01:57.180> on<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.450> first<00:01:57.689> floor<00:01:57.990> we<00:01:58.140> have<00:01:58.290> this

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469

third<00:02:12.760> floor<00:02:13.050> which<00:02:14.050> would<00:02:14.200> be<00:02:14.910> another

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
third floor which would be another

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.060 
third floor which would be another
little<00:02:16.090> balcony<00:02:16.510> it's<00:02:17.500> kind<00:02:17.710> of<00:02:17.770> a<00:02:17.860> little<00:02:17.980> bit

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:18.070 
little balcony it's kind of a little bit

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.340 
little balcony it's kind of a little bit
Maisie<00:02:18.280> this<00:02:18.580> place<00:02:19.120> until<00:02:19.840> we<00:02:19.900> have<00:02:20.110> a<00:02:20.140> ladder

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
Maisie this place until we have a ladder

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.000 
Maisie this place until we have a ladder
that<00:02:20.500> goes<00:02:20.770> up<00:02:20.950> here<00:02:21.570> to<00:02:22.680> another<00:02:23.680> back<00:02:23.830> knee

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
that goes up here to another back knee

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.940 
that goes up here to another back knee
if<00:02:24.460> you<00:02:24.520> see<00:02:24.820> the<00:02:24.940> top<00:02:25.120> view<00:02:25.680> it's<00:02:26.680> four

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
if you see the top view it's four

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.450 
if you see the top view it's four
balconies<00:02:27.160> including<00:02:28.090> that<00:02:28.390> little<00:02:28.600> Tower<00:02:29.460> so

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:30.460 
balconies including that little Tower so

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:36.000 
balconies including that little Tower so
we<00:02:30.580> just<00:02:30.700> pop<00:02:30.880> down<00:02:30.910> here<00:02:31.390> and<00:02:33.450> top<00:02:34.450> and<00:02:35.010> we're

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
we just pop down here and top and we're

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.130 
we just pop down here and top and we're
at<00:02:36.070> this<00:02:36.220> little<00:02:36.370> Tower<00:02:36.580> it's<00:02:37.570> pretty<00:02:37.750> cool<00:02:37.930> I

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
at this little Tower it's pretty cool I

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.800 
at this little Tower it's pretty cool I
think<00:02:40.140> now<00:02:41.140> we're<00:02:41.320> just<00:02:41.380> going<00:02:41.530> to<00:02:41.590> go<00:02:42.810> head

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
think now we're just going to go head

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.840 
think now we're just going to go head
back<00:02:43.990> out<00:02:44.520> we<00:02:45.520> went<00:02:45.700> here<00:02:45.880> already<00:02:46.120> I<00:02:46.270> think<00:02:46.600> um

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
back out we went here already I think um

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.140 
back out we went here already I think um
yeah<00:02:48.850> so<00:02:49.300> let's<00:02:49.540> if<00:02:49.990> we<00:02:50.140> head<00:02:50.290> out<00:02:50.410> real<00:02:50.680> quick

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
yeah so let's if we head out real quick

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.510 
yeah so let's if we head out real quick
so<00:02:52.380> I'm<00:02:53.380> going<00:02:53.620> to<00:02:53.650> talk<00:02:53.770> about<00:02:53.830> this<00:02:54.100> boat<00:02:54.280> for

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
so I'm going to talk about this boat for

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.550 
so I'm going to talk about this boat for
a<00:02:54.580> little<00:02:54.760> bit<00:02:54.880> um<00:02:55.630> what<00:02:56.050> I<00:02:56.080> was<00:02:56.230> hoping<00:02:56.500> for

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
a little bit um what I was hoping for

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.130 
a little bit um what I was hoping for
really<00:02:56.980> was<00:02:57.220> to<00:02:58.150> mainly<00:02:58.570> use<00:02:58.840> stone<00:02:59.830> as<00:03:00.160> a

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
really was to mainly use stone as a

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.740 
really was to mainly use stone as a
primary<00:03:02.340> building<00:03:03.340> material<00:03:03.880> you<00:03:04.000> know<00:03:04.120> stone

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
primary building material you know stone

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.280 
primary building material you know stone
bricks<00:03:05.050> stone<00:03:05.470> slabs<00:03:05.830> stone<00:03:06.520> cobblestone<00:03:07.360> all

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290 
bricks stone slabs stone cobblestone all

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.820 
bricks stone slabs stone cobblestone all
those<00:03:08.860> sorts<00:03:09.340> and<00:03:09.610> still<00:03:10.510> hopefully<00:03:10.900> maintain

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:11.830 
those sorts and still hopefully maintain

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.120 
those sorts and still hopefully maintain
our<00:03:12.790> layers<00:03:13.510> of<00:03:13.750> depth<00:03:14.020> as<00:03:14.290> you<00:03:14.530> can<00:03:14.740> see<00:03:14.860> here

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
our layers of depth as you can see here

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.360 
our layers of depth as you can see here
we<00:03:15.250> have<00:03:15.400> basically<00:03:16.769> stone<00:03:17.769> bricks<00:03:18.040> we<00:03:18.220> have<00:03:18.340> a

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
we have basically stone bricks we have a

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.820 
we have basically stone bricks we have a
wall<00:03:18.670> and<00:03:19.030> then<00:03:19.269> we<00:03:19.390> have<00:03:19.540> stone<00:03:19.840> and<00:03:20.200> then<00:03:20.650> we

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
wall and then we have stone and then we

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.570 
wall and then we have stone and then we
have<00:03:21.040> an<00:03:21.910> upside<00:03:22.330> down<00:03:22.360> stone<00:03:22.780> stair<00:03:23.340> just<00:03:24.340> to

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
have an upside down stone stair just to

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.820 
have an upside down stone stair just to
add<00:03:24.940> that<00:03:25.360> depth<00:03:25.780> then<00:03:26.019> it<00:03:26.110> really<00:03:26.320> just<00:03:26.530> kind

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
add that depth then it really just kind

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.699 
add that depth then it really just kind
of<00:03:26.890> makes<00:03:27.880> it<00:03:27.970> look<00:03:28.090> much<00:03:28.239> nicer<00:03:28.480> now<00:03:28.900> on<00:03:29.590> this

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
of makes it look much nicer now on this

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.680 
of makes it look much nicer now on this
one<00:03:29.860> we<00:03:29.980> have<00:03:30.010> a<00:03:30.370> half<00:03:30.670> slab<00:03:30.940> so<00:03:31.209> what<00:03:31.390> people

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
one we have a half slab so what people

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.380 
one we have a half slab so what people
could<00:03:31.870> look<00:03:32.019> out<00:03:32.200> hopefully<00:03:33.060> because<00:03:34.060> this

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
could look out hopefully because this

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:35.330 
could look out hopefully because this
thing<00:03:34.570> isn't<00:03:34.720> meant<00:03:34.959> to<00:03:35.019> be

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
thing isn't meant to be

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:42.270 
thing isn't meant to be
what's<00:03:36.340> it<00:03:38.070> barricaded<00:03:39.070> or<00:03:39.220> broken<00:03:40.120> into<00:03:41.280> if

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
what's it barricaded or broken into if

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.949 
what's it barricaded or broken into if
you're<00:03:42.880> hoping<00:03:43.120> to<00:03:43.180> rebuild<00:03:43.660> this<00:03:43.780> on<00:03:43.930> a

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
you're hoping to rebuild this on a

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:46.680 
you're hoping to rebuild this on a
server<00:03:44.290> I<00:03:45.280> will<00:03:45.700> have<00:03:45.820> a<00:03:45.880> tutorial<00:03:46.150> coming<00:03:46.600> up

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
server I will have a tutorial coming up

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.280 
server I will have a tutorial coming up
and<00:03:47.160> basically<00:03:48.160> the<00:03:48.489> dimensions<00:03:48.940> are<00:03:49.290> about

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
and basically the dimensions are about

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.430 
and basically the dimensions are about
sixteen<00:03:51.040> by<00:03:51.370> sixteen<00:03:51.430> on<00:03:52.209> the<00:03:52.750> ground<00:03:53.019> level

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
sixteen by sixteen on the ground level

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.940 
sixteen by sixteen on the ground level
now<00:03:54.280> if<00:03:54.640> you're<00:03:55.019> actually<00:03:56.019> restricted<00:03:56.530> to<00:03:56.680> a

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
now if you're actually restricted to a

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.070 
now if you're actually restricted to a
sixteen<00:03:57.519> by<00:03:57.550> sixteen<00:03:57.700> plot<00:03:58.390> where<00:03:58.660> you<00:03:58.750> cannot

sixteen by sixteen plot where you cannot
build<00:03:59.470> outside<00:03:59.920> which<00:04:00.250> I<00:04:00.459> know<00:04:00.519> there<00:04:00.760> are

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
build outside which I know there are

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:03.420 
build outside which I know there are
some<00:04:01.239> plugins<00:04:01.630> that<00:04:01.870> do<00:04:01.989> that<00:04:02.430> then

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
some plugins that do that then

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.890 
some plugins that do that then
unfortunately<00:04:03.760> you<00:04:04.150> will<00:04:04.390> not<00:04:04.510> be<00:04:04.690> able<00:04:04.750> to

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
unfortunately you will not be able to

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.759 
unfortunately you will not be able to
rebuild<00:04:05.800> these<00:04:06.190> little<00:04:06.959> overhang<00:04:07.959> buttress

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
rebuild these little overhang buttress

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:12.600 
rebuild these little overhang buttress
not<00:04:09.280> watch<00:04:09.430> it<00:04:09.610> from<00:04:09.790> battle<00:04:10.630> men<00:04:10.750> parts<00:04:11.610> and

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
not watch it from battle men parts and

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.539 
not watch it from battle men parts and
on<00:04:13.299> this<00:04:13.930> side<00:04:14.110> as<00:04:14.230> well<00:04:14.410> so<00:04:15.280> that's<00:04:15.370> a<00:04:15.459> little

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:15.549 
on this side as well so that's a little

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:17.439 
on this side as well so that's a little
bit<00:04:15.700> unfortunate<00:04:16.269> but

00:04:17.439 --> 00:04:17.449 
bit unfortunate but

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:20.360 
bit unfortunate but
hopefully<00:04:18.449> you<00:04:19.199> guys<00:04:19.320> will<00:04:19.530> still<00:04:19.739> be<00:04:20.160> able<00:04:20.220> to

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
hopefully you guys will still be able to

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.009 
hopefully you guys will still be able to
find<00:04:20.519> some<00:04:20.730> use<00:04:20.880> for<00:04:20.970> it<00:04:21.209> it's<00:04:21.359> just<00:04:21.630> for<00:04:21.810> a

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
find some use for it it's just for a

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.960 
find some use for it it's just for a
little<00:04:22.440> bit<00:04:22.800> of<00:04:22.889> added<00:04:23.070> detail<00:04:23.520> so<00:04:23.699> it's<00:04:23.850> not

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
little bit of added detail so it's not

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.020 
little bit of added detail so it's not
really<00:04:24.120> necessary<00:04:24.600> but<00:04:25.610> you<00:04:26.610> know<00:04:26.729> it<00:04:26.910> just

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
really necessary but you know it just

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.230 
really necessary but you know it just
looks<00:04:27.270> nice<00:04:27.590> and<00:04:28.590> complete<00:04:28.970> well<00:04:29.970> I<00:04:30.000> guess

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
looks nice and complete well I guess

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.550 
improvements
I<00:04:56.400> think<00:04:57.210> the<00:04:57.479> coloring<00:04:57.930> and<00:04:58.080> default<00:04:58.380> is<00:04:58.530> just

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
I think the coloring and default is just

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.350 
I think the coloring and default is just
a<00:04:58.740> little<00:04:58.950> bit<00:04:59.040> boring<00:04:59.280> but<00:04:59.550> all<00:04:59.790> the<00:04:59.970> textures

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:00.360 
a little bit boring but all the textures

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.520 
a little bit boring but all the textures
so<00:05:00.600> they<00:05:00.990> see<00:05:01.050> each<00:05:01.229> other<00:05:01.440> nicely<00:05:01.740> so<00:05:02.419> yep

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
so they see each other nicely so yep

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.400 
so they see each other nicely so yep
