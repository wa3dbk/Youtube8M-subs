00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.839
 ah 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.620
 hello very good everyone I am the central 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.060
 of battlefield 3 this time with a 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.470
 submachine gun with a self defense weapon 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.030
 which is the one I like the most in 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.279
 the game more may be one of my 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.470
 favorite weapons and without a doubt the best 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.110
 the category in my opinion we go with the 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.270
 pe 90 the fnp 90 is a submachine gun 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.480
 Belgian automatic manufactured by efe n 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.220
 gesta since 1993 is characterized for being 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.100
 quite compact with only half a meter 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.510
 of length and a weight of 3 kilograms 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.970
 uses a special ammunition the caliber 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.059
 5.7 by 28 millimeters or also called 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.040
 ss 190 have many remarkable things 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.930
 but one of the most remarkable is its 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.970
 50 bullet charger and in addition 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.339
 transparent facilitating the verification 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.930
 of the remaining ammunition its shortcomings of 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:06.150
 900 shots per minute 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.729
 combined with this charger the pe 90 is 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.670
 come back bestial let's see the pe 90 in 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.680
 butterfield we will have to sweat to 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.130
 get the 90 pe as it is unlocked 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.020
 level 40 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.780
 is one of your possible favorites of the 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.759
 people and because it will be too many 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.860
 things in favor as to not use it as 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:25.960
 its cadence of 900 shots per minute 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.479
 combined with the perfect 50 charger 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.009
 bullets 51 with the one in the bedroom that's 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.020
 the most attractive points of this weapon 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.479
 the recharge may not be your point 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.090
 strong of 250 seconds with the charger 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.069
 full of 2.90 with the empty carnival but 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.990
 It's not a very negative thing either. Remember 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:43.360
 that we have 50 bullets to use for what 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.829
 that we want the damage of this weapon is 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.689
 something that does not influence too much being 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:48.670
 pretty mediocre at 20 percent 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:51.130
 12 meters and down to 11.2 per 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.080
 hundred of the 46 meters if you really what 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.149
 we use as we should in environments 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.310
 closed this should not be a problem 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:58.630
 in terms of scope it is something that is not 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.039
 too important in this kind of 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.110
 weapons because of their focus on spaces 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:04.450
 reduced but good your speed of 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.970
 projectiles of 420 meters per second and 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.590
 its maximum reach is 630 meters this 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.209
 they are not bad numbers but the damage to 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.220
 long distances as I said 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.470
 1.2 percent makes it not too much 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.000
 recommended open combat can 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.130
 that one of the drawbacks of the weapon besides 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.390
 your reach be the precision you have what 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.250
 usual self defense weapon 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.780
 being too scattered 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.760
 especially sideways but 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.290
 controllable but I think it's not a 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.900
 important factor in close distances 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.370
 and less in this weapon because with her in 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.350
 most times it will not make us 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.400
 lack or point accuracy from the 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.220
 hip of this gun is really 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.870
 perfect almost better than pointing good 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.870
 we go with the gun accessories 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.860
 as peephole the most recommended in these 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.599
 Occasion is a reflex or cobra sight 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.730
 this is because they are the most appropriate 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.750
 for close distances something that 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.490
 benefits from full sale 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.260
 the second accessory we have the most 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.180
 essential for this weapon looks 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.010
 laser with it we will not only have 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.510
 good precision from the hip but that 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.520
 we can shoot from afar with this 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.780
 method the gaze gives it to the magician 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.480
 brutal in situations that do not have to 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.640
 point recommended 100% and finally 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.770
 better leave it as my muffler is 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.780
 neither suppression of the flash or anything these 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.300
 accessories in my opinion deteriorates the 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.400
 weapon effectiveness not recommended 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.770
 as a specialization they seem like a joke 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.820
 due to its large magazine but ammo 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.590
 due to the great expense of balears 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.880
 involuntary by the great cadence and 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.940
 carelessness that facilitates a great 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.450
 charger like pe 90 and well we are 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.270
 ending up 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.950
 we go with the conclusion in effectiveness 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:31.780
 90 is one of the best possible 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.090
 magnificent unfolds well as 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.680
 no other one deserved 10 in 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.600
 versatility happens to all 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.340
 personal defense weapons 3 the charger 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.020
 of 50 cartridges can get us out of trouble 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:45.430
 of other weapons of the same category no 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:47.890
 can 18 in the adaptation is something 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.750
 ridiculous 50 ballads cadence high and it's 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.720
 that you do not even need to point out 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.670
 simplest weapons to use a 10 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.710
 the design has to say that this weapon is 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.210
 quite peculiar is a rare thing is not 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:01.720
 the style of your additional visit but 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:03.700
 turns 16 and finally in popularity 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.560
 This weapon is one of the most used in the game 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.480
 but a game without full sale is something 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.200
 very difficult people who have it 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.120
 he finishes very happy 19 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.230
 and well the note of the weapon may not 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.180
 agree with me but in my 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.470
 opinion is the best possible game and 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.560
 which best meets in closed environments 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.060
 together with the shotguns or one day not 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.740
 miss the next guide before in the 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.930
 channel from erc to gÃ³mez we go on my channel 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.430
 you know, I hope I have helped you as 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:30.680
 always but above all have done 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.680
 have a good time a greeting and goodbye
