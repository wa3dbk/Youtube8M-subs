00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:09.019
 into some very interesting one one 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.550
 I now know a sport a sport 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.620
 a sport in which you do not 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.850
 but you have to move 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:20.730
 can move and that of 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:23.189
 subwoofers the sound of the music 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.840
 is called db drag racing and the man 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.000
 which has imported to Germany 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.699
 now at our guest please welcome 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.699
 detlef pagel welcome 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.969
 O 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:47.150
 Now explain this to us 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.980
 please tell us what that is with us 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.450
 Car racing has nothing to do 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.610
 no , this is about the 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.420
 volume of the stereo systems in the 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.230
 vehicles 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:59.450
 we have the before and butter so it goes 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.710
 I have not operated for 17 years 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.020
 we have that now in germany 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.880
 brought from America over and we have 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.430
 also different classes there is something for 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:10.220
 beginner it mean professionals 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.530
 full professionals people with their cars in 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.240
 have installed these systems and then 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.130
 is measured which were louder 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.750
 or what the discipline gives us exactly it 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.119
 is purely about the volume so what 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.770
 plant is the loudest that means we 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:22.729
 have two examples here too 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.580
 brought 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.110
 directly to one that is not possible 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.430
 That's why the car drives the car 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.930
 probably not anymore or 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.900
 the car is only ready to drive every 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.979
 it must be on its own in 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:40.640
 can drive the length 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:42.920
 So that's in the rules and here 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.780
 For example, we have team vehicle from 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.530
 team clearly clear in the back 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.960
 look where do we start times back there 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.390
 you can see there are power amplifiers in it 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.400
 quite a lot of batteries like that and now 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.200
 Of course , everyone can with the information 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:03.470
 start something but here are to 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:06.520
 example 60,000 watts installed 60060 1000 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.690
 watt for comparison an iphone has 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.459
 compare what you can with normal car 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.519
 stereo may have as standard 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:16.730
 four times 25 so 100 watts sound system 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:18.170
 maybe 200 watts I do not know 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.940
 how much water studio here sonicated 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:24.590
 but is not quite a lot watt 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:28.160
 maybe two 3400 watts 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:31.010
 and the boxers can now be seen in it 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.599
 exactly and this 60,000 bath go in 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.410
 principles on three speakers of 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:38.930
 special spl loudspeaker says 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.670
 press officer and this vehicle what 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.040
 to put here are is acting 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.739
 german champion european champion and in 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.849
 his class world record holder aha look 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:51.080
 Let's see the car for now 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:52.790
 So do not demonstrate like this 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.920
 in there booms in the change over television 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.180
 of course difficult to transfer it 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.709
 But it is very much a spectator for everyone 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.560
 volume sensitive summer times like this 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.989
 should protect these spaces on the seats 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:11.930
 yes but you would survive that though 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:16.549
 Anytime she can pull then I can 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:21.500
 yes, I also think so very often 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:23.060
 pleasant as we bad the volume 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.440
 we can present ourselves 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.900
 little idea what you can 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.970
 still can do okay with sound pressure 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.170
 and what else can you do with switches and 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.720
 we want to show times when we 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.850
 here a daily paper is put in the yes 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.799
 we float through the sound pressure 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.389
 let and then through the 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.790
 sound pressure wiener typewriter 

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:43.099
 but only tear the disc and only 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.540
 the sound pressure ok and so it comes 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:46.519
 not really music from it now but 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:51.950
 they produce an oscillator a 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:54.530
 certain frequency we have we have 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.030
 Tests come with 20 to 80 each 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.669
 Frequency of individual adrion 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.630
 because left foot is the most spectacular 

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:01.010
 pay attention to what with the 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.900
 newspaper I happened'll go one 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.250
 a bit away in time for the first time 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.609
 a bit of headphones on just one 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.609
 side free 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.050
 my dear 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:25.890
 but seen this has that deep 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:30.350
 not as pure as the middle I think 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:33.180
 that was more harmful now 65 65 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.730
 relatively low normal octave lower 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.350
 it goes even deeper even deeper quasi 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.460
 more fun that one can human 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.620
 still represent 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:44.330
 one can not only important then 20 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:47.400
 Everything is over here and below 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.830
 and up there are fun 30,000 hearts on 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.860
 the way of his 12,000 heart when you're young 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:59.670
 is 20,000 16,000 that's actually 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:05:01.920
 no longer see what what what so 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:03.990
 looks like a hero is hurt it does not 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.730
 hurt new hessian wien in the 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.530
 principle one can imagine again 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.240
 through sound pressure only here 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.890
 petit We combine playing us 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.170
 we leave just as many helpers 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:16.460
 times the silke perform nicely 

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:16.460
 ok, please 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:31.469
 so 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:43.430
 She radiates her proudly as anti-social 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:46.220
 Really there when I'm at the traffic light 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.900
 we do not make it 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:50.990
 Do something else with us especially on the 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:52.310
 Of course events did not like 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.680
 I with your private car one 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:06:00.080
 others do not open windows 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:06.740
 we need a bit of water outside 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:07.310
 because water water I'll come immediately 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.470
 again 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:11.480
 I'm getting some water right now 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:19.430
 This time I'll protect you on the roof 

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:22.700
 let's see what that does for me 

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:24.230
 I think only so first so first 

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:27.350
 let's do the bus I have yet to 

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:32.290
 just pull off my earphones 

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:32.290
 so ok it can start 

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:54.419
 orderly 

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:02.280
 So very, very healthy, it is not believable 

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:06.210
 or if you do not listen to the ears 

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:08.880
 the ears are plugged we have no damage 

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:10.170
 really not so very interesting 

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.670
 because you can then participate because 

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:14.490
 Something like that can be said 

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:15.990
 here I have the stereo system in mine 

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:17.430
 I installed car would now look around 

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:19.620
 but you should make the bet 

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:21.630
 bring at least 65,000 

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:23.970
 yes we have this entry-level class yes 

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:25.680
 they are limited to 1000 watts ok and 

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:27.540
 for the normal budget for normal 

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.980
 purse and then there is always as 

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.960
 eleven different classes on the 1st 

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:32.340
 it's great fun we travel through 

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:34.590
 throughout Germany we have everywhere 

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:35.910
 different measures and character 

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:38.160
 we are open with such open doors 

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:39.840
 events are very impressive 

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:44.580
 Thanks a lot for showing me 

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:46.050
 he office of the fhs'm from berlin 

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:47.400
 Finally summer to Cologne is not only 

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:49.560
 nice to be a total mistake but 

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:51.510
 even shopping moderately makes the mood where 

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:53.610
 They say that Berlin is service 

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:55.020
 container mo that's really difficult 

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:56.850
 You have to say here you can relax 

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:58.620
 Shopping Berlin It is really service 

00:07:56.850 --> 00:08:00.570
 could I myself I have lived 

00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:02.220
 an expensive hosek to 150 euro 

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:04.200
 which is on the seam after three days 

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:06.240
 broke down so I go back to the 

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:08.250
 loading and said seller but it 

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.450
 is not he broke three days trousers 

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:13.760
 He looks at me from top to bottom and 

00:08:09.450 --> 00:08:13.760
 say that's the way you have big legs
