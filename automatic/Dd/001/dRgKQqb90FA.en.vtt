00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:10.909
 cla 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.099
 fourth video of this dedicated series 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:17.699
 arias setting up rhythmic 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.980
 and it's time now to learn how to detach from the snare drum 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.590
 it's something we did and until now only for 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.169
 give some sort of den to avoid too much promises 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:30.139
 but in fact in real life with real musicians there is nothing that you 

00:00:30.139 --> 00:00:33.210
 requires to play only on the snare shots you have right to 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.300
 play the same for all you want 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.300
 from the moment these checks decided Thursday sales 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.180
 so for this fourth exercise 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.050
 we are going alternately placed either on big shots they are 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.210
 are snare costs but cannon you know a little bit of how all that 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.570
 works you should to find yourself without problem 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.100
 so the playback he is all happy 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.400
 the euro breaking first tech brand 3rd time 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.030
 the snare mark 2nd and 4th beat 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.430
 the spoofer hold all the time 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.430
 and we have a little trash that marks the beginning of each measure 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.400
 so I could obviously play only on the cash 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.010
 clear 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.010
 but it sounds reggae and savor something like that 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.090
 g 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.500
 according to all nights 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.560
 and then you've passed the age of playing that kind of music so let's try 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.560
 to do something else more interesting 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.340
 gold to art 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.940
 there it is much better than that together to do something 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.850
 would almost say black sabbath 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.039
 So, what happened 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.949
 so we have a cyclop of four measures 

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:14.779
 first measure we play first time 

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:16.869
 and 4th time which gives us so 

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:18.509
 a hit on the bass drum 

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:20.179
 a blow on a snare 

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:21.749
 second measure 

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:24.749
 we play first time third time and 4th time 

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:28.829
 what gives me bass drum years of bass drums in addition what does that 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:29.589
 art 

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:33.039
 for the third measurement we repeat the first identical measure 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:38.769
 elyette fourth measure where we played all the time so 1st 2nd 3rd 4th which 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.859
 we do bass drum what meets up what it is 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:42.439
 that the air 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:46.230
 then we repeat the whole cycle of four measures a second time and we finish 

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:47.799
 on the first beat 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.339
 on a little bass drum and crash 

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:52.409
 so now you're going to have the playback 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:55.409
 to exercise on you and I tell you anne next time 

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:31.509
 20 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:35.639

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.159
