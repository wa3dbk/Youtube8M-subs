pretty much ps2 gt3 on the go
this<00:00:12.630> track<00:00:12.960> is<00:00:13.139> actually<00:00:13.259> a<00:00:13.469> carbon<00:00:13.860> copy<00:00:14.040> of

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
this track is actually a carbon copy of

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.730 
this track is actually a carbon copy of
a<00:00:14.280> track<00:00:14.490> that<00:00:14.639> was<00:00:14.730> in<00:00:14.880> gt3<00:00:15.480> and<00:00:16.350> looks<00:00:16.619> pretty

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
a track that was in gt3 and looks pretty

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.740 
a track that was in gt3 and looks pretty
much<00:00:17.160> the<00:00:17.400> same<00:00:17.609> graphically<00:00:18.240> just<00:00:18.600> at

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
much the same graphically just at

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.349 
much the same graphically just at
obviously<00:00:19.109> lower<00:00:19.470> resolution<00:00:20.130> but<00:00:20.279> um<00:00:20.550> the

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
obviously lower resolution but um the

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:22.700 
obviously lower resolution but um the
lighting<00:00:21.630> is<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.750> same<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.289> track<00:00:22.529> layout

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
lighting is the same the track layout

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.279 
lighting is the same the track layout
maximum<00:00:23.189> it<00:00:23.279> actually<00:00:23.609> handles<00:00:24.119> pretty<00:00:25.050> much

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
maximum it actually handles pretty much

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.269 
maximum it actually handles pretty much
the<00:00:25.439> same

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
the same

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.310 
the same
the<00:00:26.580> PSP<00:00:26.880> nub<00:00:27.269> is<00:00:27.510> doing<00:00:27.720> a<00:00:27.779> pretty<00:00:27.960> decent<00:00:28.289> job

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
the PSP nub is doing a pretty decent job

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.290 
the PSP nub is doing a pretty decent job
of<00:00:28.769> trying<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.130> be<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.279> wannabe<00:00:29.670> analog<00:00:30.090> stick

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
of trying to be a wannabe analog stick

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.380 
of trying to be a wannabe analog stick
and<00:00:31.219> the<00:00:32.219> way<00:00:32.340> the<00:00:32.489> break<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.790> or<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.090> braking

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
and the way the break is or the braking

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.389 
and the way the break is or the braking
line<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.809> all<00:00:33.870> that<00:00:34.050> stuff<00:00:34.290> it<00:00:35.100> pretty<00:00:35.309> much

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
line and all that stuff it pretty much

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.000 
line and all that stuff it pretty much
goes<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:35.700> same<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:37.170> don't<00:00:37.620> know<00:00:37.739> if<00:00:37.860> that's

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
goes the same so I don't know if that's

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.170 
goes the same so I don't know if that's
a<00:00:38.070> good<00:00:38.190> thing<00:00:38.340> or<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.489> bad<00:00:38.520> thing<00:00:38.670> it<00:00:38.940> kind<00:00:39.120> of

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
a good thing or a bad thing it kind of

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.400 
a good thing or a bad thing it kind of
feels<00:00:39.329> like<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.480> game<00:00:39.690> I<00:00:39.750> already<00:00:40.079> played<00:00:40.290> the

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
feels like a game I already played the

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.190 
feels like a game I already played the
 out<00:00:40.739> of<00:00:40.770> five<00:00:41.760> years<00:00:41.969> ago<00:00:42.149> but<00:00:42.989> same<00:00:43.170> time

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
 out of five years ago but same time

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.959 
 out of five years ago but same time
that<00:00:43.710> game<00:00:43.890> is<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.040> good<00:00:44.160> game<00:00:44.340> I<00:00:44.579> want<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:44.820> see

that game is a good game I want to see
what<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.239> rest<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.510> its<00:00:45.660> like<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:45.809> mean<00:00:46.020> this

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
what the rest of its like I mean this

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.990 
what the rest of its like I mean this
demo<00:00:46.320> is<00:00:46.469> only<00:00:46.590> one<00:00:46.829> track<00:00:47.070> one<00:00:47.309> car<00:00:47.550> it's<00:00:47.700> very

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
demo is only one track one car it's very

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.279 
demo is only one track one car it's very
very<00:00:48.300> limited<00:00:48.450> it's<00:00:48.719> kind<00:00:48.870> just<00:00:48.989> point<00:00:49.170> out

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
very limited it's kind just point out

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.569 
very limited it's kind just point out
once<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.530> something<00:00:49.770> these<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.129> stuff<00:00:50.309> but

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
once you something these and stuff but

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.220 
once you something these and stuff but
they<00:00:50.640> don't<00:00:50.850> offer<00:00:50.969> that<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.300> you<00:00:51.420> but<00:00:52.140> at

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
they don't offer that to you but at

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.510 
they don't offer that to you but at
least<00:00:52.260> for<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.620> film<00:00:52.829> wise<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.190> would<00:00:53.370> say

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
least for the film wise I would say

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.799 
least for the film wise I would say
they've<00:00:53.760> nailed<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.210> fill<00:00:54.390> because<00:00:54.539> it's

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
they've nailed the fill because it's

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.709 
they've nailed the fill because it's
pretty<00:00:55.020> easy<00:00:55.199> to<00:00:55.379> control<00:00:55.649> on<00:00:56.180> the<00:00:57.180> PSP<00:00:57.420> and

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
pretty easy to control on the PSP and

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.950 
pretty easy to control on the PSP and
the<00:00:57.989> graphics<00:00:58.320> look<00:00:58.469> good<00:00:59.629> playing<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.750> same

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
the graphics look good playing the same

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.450 
the graphics look good playing the same

the regular PSP this little nub is kind

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.469 
the regular PSP this little nub is kind
of<00:01:12.180> funky<00:01:13.010> it<00:01:14.010> does<00:01:14.250> an<00:01:14.400> okay<00:01:14.850> job<00:01:14.880> but

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
of funky it does an okay job but

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.969 
of funky it does an okay job but
actually<00:01:16.049> been<00:01:16.170> up<00:01:16.320> on<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.560> other<00:01:16.650> one<00:01:16.799> feels

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.160 
actually been up on the other one feels
better<00:01:17.270> the<00:01:18.270> button<00:01:18.659> placement

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
better the button placement

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.330 
better the button placement
it<00:01:19.290> just<00:01:19.530> feels<00:01:19.710> crappy<00:01:19.920> feels<00:01:20.189> like<00:01:20.280> a

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
it just feels crappy feels like a

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.710 
it just feels crappy feels like a
playing<00:01:20.549> on<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.729> cell<00:01:20.939> phone<00:01:20.970> basically<00:01:21.600> it's

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
playing on a cell phone basically it's

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.999

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.010 
necessarily in a good way I'm sure I
could<00:01:28.350> get<00:01:28.439> used<00:01:28.680> to

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
could get used to

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.349
