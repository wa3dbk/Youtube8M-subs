00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:10.790 
squash bugs were on the spaghetti squash

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.070 
squash bugs were on the spaghetti squash
and<00:00:11.790> on<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.389> butternut<00:00:12.950> and<00:00:13.950> on<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.340> 8th<00:00:14.490> corn

i've yet to finish i still have to go
through<00:00:28.820> the<00:00:29.820> spaghetti<00:00:30.300> squash<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:31.250> the

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
through the spaghetti squash and the

through the spaghetti squash and the
rest<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.610> my<00:00:32.730> butternut<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.600> rest<00:00:33.809> of<00:00:33.989> my

rest of my butternut and the rest of my

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.740 
rest of my butternut and the rest of my
acorn<00:00:34.590> and<00:00:35.250> I'm<00:00:35.760> just<00:00:36.030> cutting<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.510> leaves

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
acorn and I'm just cutting the leaves

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.290 
acorn and I'm just cutting the leaves
off<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.260> have<00:00:37.440> those<00:00:37.680> eggs<00:00:37.950> on<00:00:38.280> them<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.579> I'm

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
off to have those eggs on them and I'm

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.660 
off to have those eggs on them and I'm
removing<00:00:39.480> any<00:00:39.989> mulch<00:00:40.350> from<00:00:40.980> underneath<00:00:41.370> the

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
removing any mulch from underneath the

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.380 
removing any mulch from underneath the
plant<00:00:42.320> and<00:00:43.320> when<00:00:43.800> I<00:00:43.829> cut<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.309> egg<00:00:44.430> off<00:00:44.730> when<00:00:45.360> I

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
plant and when I cut the egg off when I

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.319 
plant and when I cut the egg off when I
cut<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.780> leaf<00:00:45.989> off<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:46.590> check<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.879> see<00:00:47.910> if<00:00:48.120> it

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
cut the leaf off I check it to see if it

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.720 
cut the leaf off I check it to see if it
has<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.750> white<00:00:48.989> SAP<00:00:49.320> in<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:49.950> if<00:00:50.129> so<00:00:50.430> i'm

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
has that white SAP in it and if so i'm

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.060 
has that white SAP in it and if so i'm
just<00:00:50.789> going<00:00:51.180> to<00:00:51.239> yank<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.600> plant<00:00:51.989> i<00:00:52.289> haven't

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
just going to yank the plant i haven't

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.029 
just going to yank the plant i haven't
found<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.430> yet<00:00:53.610> but<00:00:54.350> i<00:00:55.350> got<00:00:55.500> a<00:00:55.530> whole<00:00:55.739> lot<00:00:56.010> of

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
found it yet but i got a whole lot of

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.270 
found it yet but i got a whole lot of
squash<00:00:56.430> plants<00:00:57.559> and<00:00:58.559> i<00:00:58.649> hate<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:58.890> see<00:00:59.219> them

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
squash plants and i hate to see them

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.230 
squash plants and i hate to see them
i'll<00:00:59.489> go<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.730> waste

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:05.240 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.999 

so<00:01:06.240> in<00:01:06.390> hindsight<00:01:06.570> I<00:01:07.200> think<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.649> was<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.770> bad

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:08.009 
so in hindsight I think it was a bad

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.380 
so in hindsight I think it was a bad
idea<00:01:08.299> mulching<00:01:09.530> natural<00:01:10.530> or<00:01:10.680> otherwise

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
idea mulching natural or otherwise

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.260 
idea mulching natural or otherwise
around<00:01:12.390> any<00:01:12.630> of<00:01:12.840> these<00:01:12.960> squash<00:01:13.409> plants

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
around any of these squash plants

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.270 
around any of these squash plants
because<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.420> gives<00:01:15.630> those<00:01:15.990> squash<00:01:16.649> bugs<00:01:17.040> a

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
because it gives those squash bugs a

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.410 
because it gives those squash bugs a
place<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.700> hide<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.740> also<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:20.070> prevents<00:01:21.060> you

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
place to hide and also it prevents you

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.830 
place to hide and also it prevents you
from<00:01:21.450> being<00:01:21.990> able<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.680> see<00:01:23.039> if<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:24.479> got<00:01:24.659> the

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
from being able to see if you got the

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:32.749 
from being able to see if you got the
vine<00:01:25.080> borers<00:01:25.590> down<00:01:25.830> in<00:01:26.070> there<00:01:26.340> I<00:01:31.490> didn't<00:01:32.490> mulch

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
vine borers down in there I didn't mulch

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.749 
vine borers down in there I didn't mulch
around<00:01:33.259> these<00:01:34.259> acorn<00:01:34.740> squash<00:01:34.950> and<00:01:35.520> they<00:01:35.610> don't

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
around these acorn squash and they don't

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.830 
around these acorn squash and they don't
have<00:01:36.030> any<00:01:36.210> vine<00:01:36.509> borers<00:01:39.799> but<00:01:40.799> it<00:01:40.920> looks<00:01:41.159> like

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
have any vine borers but it looks like

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.779 
have any vine borers but it looks like
the<00:01:42.840> butternut<00:01:43.610> and<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.880> spaghetti<00:01:45.299> squash

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 
the butternut and the spaghetti squash

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:51.800 
the butternut and the spaghetti squash
and<00:01:47.959> my<00:01:48.959> crookneck<00:01:49.319> squash<00:01:50.030> I'll<00:01:51.030> possibly

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
and my crookneck squash I'll possibly

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.380 
and my crookneck squash I'll possibly
have<00:01:52.020> vine<00:01:52.530> borers<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.970> that's<00:01:54.179> because

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
have vine borers and that's because

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.350 
have vine borers and that's because
there<00:01:54.720> was<00:01:54.840> mulch<00:01:55.110> around<00:01:55.289> there<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.360> I

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
there was mulch around there and I

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.719 
there was mulch around there and I
couldn't<00:01:57.840> see<00:01:58.140> down<00:01:58.350> in<00:01:58.560> there<00:01:58.770> plus<00:01:59.280> I<00:01:59.459> didn't

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
couldn't see down in there plus I didn't

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.070 
couldn't see down in there plus I didn't
really<00:01:59.850> know<00:02:00.090> what<00:02:00.119> I<00:02:00.270> was<00:02:00.450> looking<00:02:00.659> for<00:02:00.840> I've

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
really know what I was looking for I've

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.499 
really know what I was looking for I've
never<00:02:01.319> had<00:02:01.560> this<00:02:01.740> problem<00:02:01.799> before<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:03.000> I

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
never had this problem before and I

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.449 
never had this problem before and I
think<00:02:03.599> what<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.110> is<00:02:04.140> is<00:02:04.289> we<00:02:04.679> had<00:02:04.830> a<00:02:04.860> really<00:02:05.130> mild

00:02:05.449 --> 00:02:05.459 
think what it is is we had a really mild

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:08.990 
think what it is is we had a really mild
winter<00:02:05.939> so<00:02:06.780> all<00:02:06.990> these<00:02:07.200> bugs<00:02:07.610> were<00:02:08.610> able<00:02:08.910> to

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
winter so all these bugs were able to

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.759 
winter so all these bugs were able to
overwinter<00:02:09.479> and<00:02:09.899> we're<00:02:10.049> just<00:02:10.200> overrun<00:02:10.709> with

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:10.769 
overwinter and we're just overrun with

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.580 
overwinter and we're just overrun with
them<00:02:11.450> that's<00:02:12.450> all<00:02:12.660> I<00:02:12.690> can<00:02:12.989> figure<00:02:13.170> because

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
them that's all I can figure because

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.849 
them that's all I can figure because
I've<00:02:13.739> never<00:02:14.010> had<00:02:14.310> issues<00:02:14.549> with<00:02:15.120> squash<00:02:15.859> other

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:16.859 
I've never had issues with squash other

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:20.180 
I've never had issues with squash other
than<00:02:17.900> the<00:02:18.900> bacteria<00:02:19.590> or<00:02:19.739> whatever<00:02:20.100> that

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
than the bacteria or whatever that

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.330 
than the bacteria or whatever that
causes<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.030> fruit<00:02:21.510> themselves<00:02:22.230> to<00:02:22.500> wilt<00:02:22.769> and

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
causes the fruit themselves to wilt and

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.770 
causes the fruit themselves to wilt and
the<00:02:24.209> mouthwash<00:02:24.690> always<00:02:25.170> takes<00:02:25.440> care<00:02:25.769> of<00:02:25.799> that

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
the mouthwash always takes care of that

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.080 
the mouthwash always takes care of that
all<00:02:27.780> these<00:02:27.989> bugs<00:02:28.410> are<00:02:28.739> new<00:02:29.010> to<00:02:29.190> me<00:02:29.400> I've<00:02:29.730> never

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
all these bugs are new to me I've never

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.930 
all these bugs are new to me I've never
had<00:02:30.390> issue<00:02:30.630> with<00:02:30.840> them<00:02:31.200> but<00:02:32.160> i<00:02:32.190> always<00:02:32.549> have

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
had issue with them but i always have

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.630 
had issue with them but i always have
pretreated<00:02:33.720> my<00:02:33.900> soil<00:02:34.260> before<00:02:34.530> I<00:02:34.769> plant<00:02:35.160> and<00:02:35.549> I

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
pretreated my soil before I plant and I

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.090 
pretreated my soil before I plant and I
always<00:02:35.850> till<00:02:36.359> it<00:02:36.510> up<00:02:36.630> in<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:36.870> fall<00:02:37.170> and<00:02:37.890> those

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
always till it up in the fall and those

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.690 
always till it up in the fall and those
are<00:02:38.130> two<00:02:38.489> things<00:02:38.519> that<00:02:39.380> you<00:02:40.380> should<00:02:40.680> do<00:02:41.040> if<00:02:41.370> you

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
are two things that you should do if you

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.300 
are two things that you should do if you
want<00:02:41.850> to<00:02:42.000> prevent<00:02:42.180> these<00:02:43.170> kind<00:02:43.500> of<00:02:43.620> bugs<00:02:43.859> from

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
want to prevent these kind of bugs from

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.849 
want to prevent these kind of bugs from
being<00:02:44.970> a<00:02:45.120> problem<00:02:45.510> in<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:45.690> first<00:02:45.870> place<00:02:46.049> if

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:46.859 
being a problem in the first place if

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:50.629 
being a problem in the first place if
you<00:02:47.100> till<00:02:47.340> it<00:02:47.489> up<00:02:47.609> in<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:47.850> fall<00:02:48.440> it<00:02:49.639> takes

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:50.639 
you till it up in the fall it takes

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:52.129 
you till it up in the fall it takes
those<00:02:50.880> bugs<00:02:51.269> up<00:02:51.569> that<00:02:51.840> we're<00:02:51.959> going<00:02:52.079> to

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:52.139 
those bugs up that we're going to

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:56.150 
those bugs up that we're going to
overwinter<00:02:52.620> and<00:02:53.160> it<00:02:53.250> disturbs<00:02:53.670> them<00:02:54.230> and<00:02:55.230> if

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
overwinter and it disturbs them and if

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.539 
overwinter and it disturbs them and if
you<00:02:56.280> pretreat<00:02:56.880> in<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:57.060> spring<00:02:57.420> with<00:02:58.079> the

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
you pretreat in the spring with the

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:01.039 
you pretreat in the spring with the
mouthwash<00:02:59.549> and<00:02:59.609> dish<00:03:00.090> soap<00:03:00.120> and<00:03:00.630> stuff<00:03:00.720> like

mouthwash and dish soap and stuff like

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:02.900 
mouthwash and dish soap and stuff like
that<00:03:01.109> before<00:03:01.530> you<00:03:01.889> plant<00:03:02.220> a<00:03:02.430> couple<00:03:02.790> weeks

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
that before you plant a couple weeks

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.180 
that before you plant a couple weeks
before<00:03:03.269> you<00:03:03.359> plant<00:03:03.630> it<00:03:04.200> kills<00:03:04.560> a<00:03:04.739> lot<00:03:04.889> of<00:03:05.040> those

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
before you plant it kills a lot of those

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.180 
before you plant it kills a lot of those
bugs<00:03:05.579> and<00:03:05.910> their<00:03:06.000> eggs<00:03:06.209> and<00:03:06.510> stuff<00:03:06.720> off<00:03:07.190> so

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
bugs and their eggs and stuff off so

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.150 
bugs and their eggs and stuff off so
that<00:03:08.420> you<00:03:09.420> just<00:03:09.630> don't<00:03:09.810> have<00:03:10.139> them<00:03:10.440> so<00:03:11.100> you

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
that you just don't have them so you

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.000 
that you just don't have them so you
don't<00:03:11.459> have<00:03:11.670> to<00:03:11.880> deal<00:03:12.120> with<00:03:12.269> them

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
don't have to deal with them

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.670 
don't have to deal with them
once<00:03:13.310> the<00:03:13.489> plants<00:03:13.819> start<00:03:14.090> growing<00:03:14.510> I<00:03:14.780> went

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
once the plants start growing I went

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.110 
once the plants start growing I went
through<00:03:15.860> and<00:03:16.010> I've<00:03:16.129> removed<00:03:16.430> all<00:03:16.670> the<00:03:16.730> mulch

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
through and I've removed all the mulch

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.350 
through and I've removed all the mulch
from<00:03:17.450> around<00:03:17.780> all<00:03:17.959> squash<00:03:18.409> plants<00:03:18.980> I<00:03:19.360> squished

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.360 
from around all squash plants I squished

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.539 
from around all squash plants I squished
every<00:03:20.720> squash<00:03:21.079> bug<00:03:21.409> and<00:03:21.620> cucumber<00:03:22.129> beetle<00:03:22.459> I

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
every squash bug and cucumber beetle I

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:25.960 
every squash bug and cucumber beetle I
found<00:03:22.909> and<00:03:24.159> even<00:03:25.159> killed<00:03:25.459> one<00:03:25.730> of<00:03:25.760> those

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
found and even killed one of those

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.740 
found and even killed one of those
buying<00:03:26.540> bore<00:03:26.840> moss<00:03:28.180> and<00:03:29.799> went<00:03:30.799> through<00:03:31.099> and

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
buying bore moss and went through and

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.390 
buying bore moss and went through and
pretty<00:03:32.750> much<00:03:32.930> just<00:03:33.170> cut<00:03:33.470> the<00:03:33.620> Leafs<00:03:33.829> right<00:03:34.190> off

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
pretty much just cut the Leafs right off

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.729 
pretty much just cut the Leafs right off
anywhere<00:03:35.329> there<00:03:35.569> was<00:03:35.720> egg<00:03:35.989> because<00:03:36.530> those

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
anywhere there was egg because those

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.640 
anywhere there was egg because those
eggs<00:03:37.010> are<00:03:37.159> so<00:03:37.370> small<00:03:37.700> I<00:03:38.030> read<00:03:38.720> online<00:03:38.959> that<00:03:39.260> you

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
eggs are so small I read online that you

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.830 
eggs are so small I read online that you
just<00:03:39.829> rub<00:03:40.069> them<00:03:40.280> off<00:03:40.519> with<00:03:40.730> your<00:03:40.760> finger<00:03:41.239> well

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
just rub them off with your finger well

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.479 
just rub them off with your finger well
they<00:03:42.019> lay<00:03:42.200> their<00:03:42.230> eggs<00:03:42.590> right<00:03:42.920> between<00:03:43.220> the

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
they lay their eggs right between the

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.670 
they lay their eggs right between the
veins<00:03:44.209> so<00:03:44.569> you<00:03:44.629> can't<00:03:44.959> get<00:03:45.109> your<00:03:45.260> finger<00:03:45.590> in

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
veins so you can't get your finger in

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.250 
veins so you can't get your finger in
there<00:03:45.799> to<00:03:45.920> rub<00:03:46.069> mop<00:03:46.370> and<00:03:46.730> you<00:03:47.659> end<00:03:47.959> up<00:03:48.019> damaging

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
there to rub mop and you end up damaging

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.229 
there to rub mop and you end up damaging
the<00:03:48.680> leaf<00:03:48.859> so<00:03:49.159> I<00:03:49.190> just<00:03:49.430> cut<00:03:49.640> the<00:03:49.790> whole<00:03:49.970> leaf

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
the leaf so I just cut the whole leaf

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:52.180 
the leaf so I just cut the whole leaf
off<00:03:50.510> or<00:03:50.840> tear<00:03:51.139> that<00:03:51.319> whole<00:03:51.530> section<00:03:51.829> of<00:03:52.129> the

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
off or tear that whole section of the

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.449 
off or tear that whole section of the
leaf<00:03:52.340> right<00:03:52.579> off<00:03:52.849> and<00:03:53.810> when<00:03:54.290> I<00:03:54.319> do<00:03:54.440> that<00:03:54.799> I<00:03:55.010> also

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
leaf right off and when I do that I also

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.940 
leaf right off and when I do that I also
check<00:03:55.790> them<00:03:56.000> to<00:03:56.930> make<00:03:56.959> sure<00:03:57.170> there<00:03:57.500> wasn't<00:03:57.680> any

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
check them to make sure there wasn't any

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.309 
check them to make sure there wasn't any
bacterial<00:03:58.700> wilt<00:03:58.879> which<00:03:59.389> you<00:03:59.720> should<00:03:59.930> see<00:04:00.139> that

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
bacterial wilt which you should see that

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:02.619 
bacterial wilt which you should see that
white<00:04:00.560> sap<00:04:01.060> according<00:04:02.060> to<00:04:02.090> what<00:04:02.359> i<00:04:02.389> read

00:04:02.619 --> 00:04:02.629 
white sap according to what i read

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:05.110 
white sap according to what i read
online<00:04:02.920> but<00:04:03.920> what<00:04:04.280> I<00:04:04.310> read<00:04:04.609> was<00:04:04.639> from<00:04:05.000> an

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 
online but what I read was from an

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.729 
online but what I read was from an
agricultural<00:04:06.579> website<00:04:07.930> so<00:04:08.930> hopefully<00:04:09.409> the

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
agricultural website so hopefully the

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:13.000 
agricultural website so hopefully the
information<00:04:09.799> is<00:04:10.370> good<00:04:10.639> and<00:04:11.420> I<00:04:12.109> checked

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
information is good and I checked

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.920 
information is good and I checked
probably<00:04:13.849> three<00:04:14.030> or<00:04:14.060> four<00:04:14.180> different<00:04:14.450> sources

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
probably three or four different sources

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.090 
probably three or four different sources
on<00:04:15.170> it<00:04:15.500> and<00:04:15.650> they<00:04:15.709> all<00:04:15.829> said<00:04:16.100> the<00:04:16.250> same<00:04:16.280> thing

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.980 

hopefully<00:04:19.490> this<00:04:19.670> will<00:04:19.790> take<00:04:19.970> care<00:04:20.300> of<00:04:20.360> it<00:04:20.570> I'm

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:20.990 
hopefully this will take care of it I'm

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:22.980 
hopefully this will take care of it I'm
just<00:04:21.230> have<00:04:21.350> to<00:04:21.500> get<00:04:21.650> out<00:04:21.800> of<00:04:21.830> here

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
infested with bugs simply because the

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:07.430 
infested with bugs simply because the
