game in order to make the video I must

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.480 
game in order to make the video I must
say<00:00:15.389> oh<00:00:15.859> yes<00:00:16.859> it<00:00:17.430> is<00:00:17.699> but<00:00:18.630> have<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:19.020> look<00:00:19.490> now

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
say oh yes it is but have a look now

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.689 
say oh yes it is but have a look now
here's<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.300> intro<00:00:21.510> stage<00:00:22.580> explicitly<00:00:23.580> the

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
here's the intro stage explicitly the

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.259 
here's the intro stage explicitly the
bridge<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.500> dragging<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.590> just<00:00:25.859> update<00:00:26.400> now

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
bridge and dragging the just update now

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.859 
bridge and dragging the just update now
you<00:00:27.330> tack<00:00:27.660> down<00:00:27.900> go<00:00:28.439> back<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:29.510> kill<00:00:30.510> them<00:00:30.630> it's

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
you tack down go back and kill them it's

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.410 
you tack down go back and kill them it's
actually<00:00:31.260> it's<00:00:31.800> not<00:00:31.949> that<00:00:32.030> big<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.239> problem

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
actually it's not that big of a problem

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.900 
actually it's not that big of a problem
but<00:00:33.890> the<00:00:34.890> main<00:00:35.100> problem<00:00:35.280> I<00:00:35.550> have<00:00:35.700> with<00:00:35.730> this

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
but the main problem I have with this

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.650 
but the main problem I have with this
game<00:00:36.210> is<00:00:36.660> that<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.079> controls<00:00:37.469> are<00:00:37.649> so

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
game is that the controls are so

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.860 
game is that the controls are so
unresponsive<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:41.239> you're<00:00:42.239> correct<00:00:42.510> it's<00:00:42.719> way

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
unresponsive and you're correct it's way

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.410 
unresponsive and you're correct it's way
too<00:00:42.930> slow<00:00:43.399> compared<00:00:44.399> to<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.610> enemies<00:00:47.420> now

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
too slow compared to the enemies now

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.790 
too slow compared to the enemies now
here's<00:00:48.780> another<00:00:49.020> thing<00:00:49.289> that<00:00:49.350> really<00:00:49.649> pisses

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
here's another thing that really pisses

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.709 
here's another thing that really pisses
me<00:00:50.190> off<00:00:50.600> look<00:00:51.600> at<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.780> energy<00:00:52.110> bar<00:00:53.360> it's<00:00:54.360> going

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
me off look at the energy bar it's going

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.389 
me off look at the energy bar it's going
down<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.230> why<00:00:56.100> I'm<00:00:56.610> just<00:00:57.000> brung<00:00:57.480> my<00:00:57.629> knife<00:00:58.399> the

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
down and why I'm just brung my knife the

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.279 
down and why I'm just brung my knife the
energy<00:00:59.760> bar<00:00:59.940> girls<00:01:00.210> done<00:01:00.449> simply<00:01:00.899> by<00:01:00.930> using

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
energy bar girls done simply by using

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.429 
energy bar girls done simply by using
your<00:01:01.620> fucking<00:01:02.039> weapons<00:01:02.780> how<00:01:03.780> ridiculous<00:01:03.960> is

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
your fucking weapons how ridiculous is

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.289 
your fucking weapons how ridiculous is
dead<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:04.970> can't<00:01:05.970> believe<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:07.670> okay<00:01:08.670> let's<00:01:09.180> move

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
you have an energy bar but nearly

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.070 
you have an energy bar but nearly
everything<00:01:54.760> kills<00:01:54.940> you<00:01:55.060> learn<00:01:55.270> it<00:01:55.390> just<00:01:55.750> like

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080

actually<00:02:20.170> still<00:02:20.620> the<00:02:20.680> first<00:02:21.040> level<00:02:21.370> of<00:02:21.640> the

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
actually still the first level of the

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.490 
actually still the first level of the
game<00:02:22.060> it's<00:02:22.450> not<00:02:22.660> very<00:02:22.720> far<00:02:23.140> into<00:02:23.290> the<00:02:23.470> game

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
game it's not very far into the game

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.490 
game it's not very far into the game
it's<00:02:24.010> the<00:02:24.220> first<00:02:24.490> level<00:02:24.910> and<00:02:25.180> you<00:02:25.930> barely<00:02:26.230> have

which<00:04:21.359> this<00:04:21.750> game<00:04:22.019> has<00:04:22.199> been<00:04:22.380> made<00:04:25.100> this<00:04:26.100> game

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
which this game has been made this game

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.159 
which this game has been made this game
could<00:04:26.520> actually<00:04:26.760> be<00:04:27.030> quite<00:04:27.240> decent<00:04:27.720> if<00:04:27.870> your

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
could actually be quite decent if your

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:30.170 
could actually be quite decent if your
character<00:04:28.860> wasn't<00:04:29.250> so<00:04:29.490> slow<00:04:29.760> and<00:04:29.970> the

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
character wasn't so slow and the

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.920 
character wasn't so slow and the
controls<00:04:30.630> burn<00:04:30.870> so<00:04:31.110> awfully<00:04:31.979> unresponsive<00:04:32.930> so

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
controls burn so awfully unresponsive so

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.320 
controls burn so awfully unresponsive so
it's<00:04:34.320> just<00:04:34.590> got<00:04:34.800> great<00:04:35.070> graphics<00:04:35.340> but<00:04:36.180> the

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
it's just got great graphics but the

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:42.610 
it's just got great graphics but the
rest<00:04:36.540> is<00:04:37.430> for<00:04:38.430> the<00:04:38.520> trash<00:04:38.789> can<00:04:39.030> i<00:04:39.240> would<00:04:39.630> say

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.500 

again<00:04:43.620> graphics<00:04:44.220> don't<00:04:44.580> make<00:04:44.850> the<00:04:45.000> gameplay

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
again graphics don't make the gameplay

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.390
