00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
but it looks real under the water it's

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.799 
but it looks real under the water it's
the<00:00:44.309> first<00:00:44.610> bait<00:00:44.850> in<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.059> history<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.420> fishing

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
the first bait in the history of fishing

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.040 
the first bait in the history of fishing
to<00:00:46.320> move<00:00:46.590> without<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.340> angler<00:00:48.050> implementing

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
to move without the angler implementing

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.410 
to move without the angler implementing
action<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.070> it's<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.520> soft<00:00:50.760> plastic<00:00:51.000> bait

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
action to it it's a soft plastic bait

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.389 
action to it it's a soft plastic bait
this<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.989> hand<00:00:52.199> floor<00:00:52.469> version<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.070> this

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
this is the hand floor version and this

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.069 
this is the hand floor version and this
is<00:00:53.550> gonna<00:00:53.670> be<00:00:53.850> awesome<00:00:54.059> for<00:00:54.420> drop<00:00:54.780> shot<00:00:55.050> and

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
is gonna be awesome for drop shot and

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.209 
is gonna be awesome for drop shot and
what<00:00:55.289> they've<00:00:55.440> done<00:00:55.620> is<00:00:55.860> they've<00:00:56.190> put

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
what they've done is they've put

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.939 
what they've done is they've put
molecules<00:00:57.000> in<00:00:57.300> here<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:58.140> heat<00:00:58.410> molecules

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
molecules in here and the heat molecules

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.220 
molecules in here and the heat molecules
so<00:00:59.160> they've<00:00:59.309> react<00:00:59.670> to<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.120> underwater<00:01:00.570> heat

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
so they've react to the underwater heat

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.049 
so they've react to the underwater heat
currents<00:01:01.710> if<00:01:01.890> any<00:01:02.190> body<00:01:02.460> water<00:01:02.699> doesn't

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059

currents with different temperatures

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.219 
currents with different temperatures
running<00:01:06.000> in<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.210> water<00:01:06.330> when<00:01:06.810> they<00:01:06.930> hit<00:01:07.080> this

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
running in the water when they hit this

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.560 
running in the water when they hit this
bait<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.770> actually<00:01:08.430> ripples<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.090> as<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.360> guy

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
bait it actually ripples and as a guy

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.120 
bait it actually ripples and as a guy
who<00:01:09.630> does<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.869> lot<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.200> drop<00:01:10.409> shot<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:10.860> on<00:01:10.920> Lake

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
who does a lot of drop shot and on Lake

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.010
