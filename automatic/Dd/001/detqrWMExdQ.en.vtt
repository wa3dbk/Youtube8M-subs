00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:06.660
 Hello everyone 

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:10.360
 It is the end of the world rubber market 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:14.530
 Today's table tennis wisdom bag 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:17.530
 I 'm going to do something that I've cut and turned . 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:22.130
 I than soft thought 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:27.880
 To Tteyuu Chiquita in Table software I think let's challenge 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:29.300
 In fact, when I say that the rotation that has disappeared firmly in the super slow image is Chikyta 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.829
 In table software 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:36.340
 And How Do Once you can look up to, or rather would fly to the rotation went and Chiquita 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:36.340
 think 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:46.180
 I'd a be said to Chiquita a rotation plus clean 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:48.110
 Downward rotation is assumed to be a straight car rotation 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:53.720
 We around these rotation 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:55.650
 Since there next to the the say at this time of the cram school in the rotation is weak part is because this next part 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.340
 Become 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:01.940
 vice versa 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:07.549
 Seeing from myself, the front side is the strongest part of rotation when you hit a ball 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:08.360
 It captures the front at the time of society and Chikito of front home game when the Chiquita because it is 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:14.509
 If it happens 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:19.580
 Because that would fall in Boto' and strong rotation heard Tteyuu firmly burnt-out car rotation 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:22.070
 The time is closer to the axis of the conclusion that you can be aware of the location of the shaft 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:27.400
 Please try to catch Yokogawa 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:31.740
 It is possible to capture the weak portion of the rotation than by doing so 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:37.330
 You can hear the stone firmly without being influenced by the rotation 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:40.670
 Another point to turn the car rotation of Buchigire is 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:43.280
 Because it is easy to fall after all 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:47.450
 Than to say skip 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:53.060
 Isn't it a kind of scoopy scoopy image? 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:57.000
 The image is a bit higher than the speedy sense of speed. 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:01.110
 Enter Te ask if Ah stop doing 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:08.420
 Because it is a chart software, I'm going to give it some speed 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:09.920
 Have hooked Gutte the grain is hooked to the second only To a jerk because it may put away all surface 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:15.260
 Issue a height 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:21.319
 If you try to rub it on the surface here, it slips, so it is an image that you can hook it 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:25.300
 If it is done with the image which makes the key a little higher after capturing the side , the downturn of the buchigiri 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:29.520
 You will be able to receive 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.520
 So we will actually do it, so please take a look 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:37.099
 What 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.099
