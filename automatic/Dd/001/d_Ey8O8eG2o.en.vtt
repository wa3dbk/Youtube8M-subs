00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
for many people and in many

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.769 
for many people and in many
circumstances<00:00:04.670> we<00:00:05.670> have<00:00:05.700> a<00:00:05.910> lot<00:00:06.150> of<00:00:06.180> problems

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
circumstances we have a lot of problems

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.560 
circumstances we have a lot of problems
one<00:00:07.620> of<00:00:07.770> those<00:00:07.980> problems<00:00:08.460> is<00:00:08.639> that<00:00:08.880> children

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
one of those problems is that children

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.110 
one of those problems is that children
have<00:00:09.809> very<00:00:09.840> different<00:00:10.320> aptitudes<00:00:11.120> about

of<00:01:14.070> all<00:01:14.189> writing<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:14.670> very<00:01:14.729> very<00:01:15.030> complicated

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
of all writing is very very complicated

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.490 
of all writing is very very complicated
first<00:01:16.470> you've<00:01:16.890> got<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.159> stay<00:01:17.610> in<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:18.030> chair

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
first you've got to stay in the chair

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.440 
first you've got to stay in the chair
then<00:01:19.500> you've<00:01:20.250> got<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.729> hold<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.090> pencil

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
then you've got to hold the pencil

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.030 
then you've got to hold the pencil
correctly<00:01:21.600> so<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.140> do<00:01:22.380> not<00:01:22.500> get<00:01:22.680> yelled<00:01:22.830> at

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
correctly so you do not get yelled at

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.060 
correctly so you do not get yelled at
then<00:01:23.970> you've<00:01:24.330> got<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.960> remember<00:01:25.380> which<00:01:25.830> way

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
then you've got to remember which way

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.590 
then you've got to remember which way
the<00:01:26.280> B's<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.299> DS<00:01:27.630> go<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.909> on<00:01:29.909> top<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.360> all

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
the B's and the DS go and on top of all

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.999 
the B's and the DS go and on top of all
that<00:01:30.840> you've<00:01:30.990> got<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.350> think<00:01:31.500> it's<00:01:31.650> words<00:01:31.860> you

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
that you've got to think it's words you

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.620 
that you've got to think it's words you
actually<00:01:32.520> might<00:01:32.729> be<00:01:32.759> able<00:01:33.030> to<00:01:33.329> spell

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
actually might be able to spell

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.930 
actually might be able to spell
correctly

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
correctly

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.480 
correctly
and<00:01:35.940> if<00:01:36.300> used<00:01:36.720> on<00:01:36.900> top<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.800> all<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:37.980> say<00:01:38.430> to

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
and if used on top of all that say to

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.700 
and if used on top of all that say to
the<00:01:38.610> child<00:01:38.940> think<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:40.140> an<00:01:40.710> original<00:01:41.430> idea

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
the child think of an original idea

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.710 
the child think of an original idea
that's<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:44.010> final<00:01:44.340> straw<00:01:44.580> and<00:01:44.820> it<00:01:45.030> blows<00:01:45.450> his

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
that's the final straw and it blows his

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.420 
that's the final straw and it blows his
little<00:01:46.020> circuits<00:01:46.410> and<00:01:46.560> it's<00:01:46.860> not<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.280> he

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
little circuits and it's not that he

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.020 
little circuits and it's not that he
doesn't<00:01:47.820> want<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.150> he<00:01:48.600> simply<00:01:49.140> cannot<00:01:49.950> do<00:01:50.790> all

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
doesn't want to he simply cannot do all

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.640 
doesn't want to he simply cannot do all
of<00:01:51.060> that<00:01:51.390> all<00:01:51.750> at<00:01:52.230> once

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:52.650 
of that all at once

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.580 
of that all at once
yet<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.760> so<00:01:54.540> then<00:01:54.780> we<00:01:54.990> become<00:01:55.320> very

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
yet and so then we become very

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.950 
yet and so then we become very
frustrated<00:01:56.400> knowing<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.240> we<00:01:57.360> should<00:01:57.750> be

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
frustrated knowing that we should be

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.590 
frustrated knowing that we should be
able<00:01:58.080> to<00:01:58.260> teach<00:01:58.530> this<00:01:58.740> child<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.520> write<00:01:59.760> but<00:02:00.330> we

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
able to teach this child to write but we

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.140 
able to teach this child to write but we
just<00:02:00.900> are<00:02:01.200> up<00:02:01.860> against<00:02:02.400> a<00:02:02.520> wall<00:02:02.640> with<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:03.030> now

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
just are up against a wall with it now

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.390 
just are up against a wall with it now
that<00:02:03.330> is<00:02:03.510> an<00:02:03.630> extreme<00:02:04.050> case<00:02:04.080> but<00:02:04.740> I<00:02:04.770> think<00:02:04.890> from

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
that is an extreme case but I think from

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.970 
that is an extreme case but I think from
the<00:02:05.970> the<00:02:06.330> laughs<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:06.720> chuckles<00:02:07.110> that<00:02:07.560> if<00:02:07.770> we

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:07.980 
the the laughs and chuckles that if we

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.770 
the the laughs and chuckles that if we
have<00:02:08.430> more<00:02:08.790> than<00:02:08.970> one<00:02:09.149> child<00:02:09.330> at<00:02:09.570> home<00:02:09.720> and

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
have more than one child at home and

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.990 
have more than one child at home and
certainly<00:02:10.290> if<00:02:10.410> we<00:02:10.530> have<00:02:10.680> a<00:02:10.710> classroom<00:02:11.400> we<00:02:11.970> have

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
certainly if we have a classroom we have

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.870 
certainly if we have a classroom we have
got<00:02:12.330> children<00:02:12.690> on<00:02:13.530> both<00:02:13.830> ends<00:02:14.190> and<00:02:14.310> all<00:02:14.550> up<00:02:14.760> and

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
got children on both ends and all up and

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.460 
got children on both ends and all up and
down<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.180> extreme<00:02:15.540> and<00:02:15.660> our<00:02:15.840> challenge<00:02:16.350> as

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
down the extreme and our challenge as

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.360 
down the extreme and our challenge as
teachers<00:02:16.890> is<00:02:17.040> how<00:02:17.250> to<00:02:17.760> address<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:19.500> these

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
teachers is how to address the these

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.490 
teachers is how to address the these
children<00:02:20.910> and<00:02:21.120> teach<00:02:21.600> them<00:02:21.630> effectively<00:02:22.260> all

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
children and teach them effectively all

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.330 
children and teach them effectively all
at<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.160> same<00:02:23.370> time<00:02:24.050> also<00:02:25.050> teaching<00:02:25.950> writing

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
at the same time also teaching writing

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.610 
at the same time also teaching writing
is<00:02:26.610> difficult<00:02:27.330> because<00:02:27.480> some<00:02:28.380> of<00:02:28.410> the

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
is difficult because some of the

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.100 
is difficult because some of the
materials<00:02:29.340> that<00:02:29.730> are<00:02:29.790> available<00:02:29.910> are<00:02:30.570> perhaps

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
materials that are available are perhaps

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.710 
materials that are available are perhaps
not<00:02:31.410> as<00:02:31.830> useful<00:02:32.340> as<00:02:32.730> you<00:02:33.000> might<00:02:33.150> have<00:02:33.240> hoped<00:02:33.450> in

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
not as useful as you might have hoped in

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.420 
not as useful as you might have hoped in
in<00:02:34.470> one<00:02:34.770> extreme<00:02:35.280> of<00:02:35.490> what's<00:02:36.060> available<00:02:36.210> there

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
in one extreme of what's available there

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.470 
in one extreme of what's available there
is<00:02:38.430> what<00:02:38.580> I<00:02:38.610> would<00:02:38.730> call<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.150> grammar

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:54.390 
exactly when he'll be done so there will

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:57.620
