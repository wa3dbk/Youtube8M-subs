00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:10.980
 And, folks, beauty, we're back with 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.900
 another minecraft video for pc and 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.990
 today I will present here a template of the 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.840
 bombs the name of the mold is more bombs 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.270
 if I'm not mistaken, this is the name, right? 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.779
 There are several types of bombs right there. 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:28.019
 since dynamites advance five times 20 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.449
 times in and times 500 nÃ© 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.460
 he has a few other sub bombs here that 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.980
 are really cool pumps even more the 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.750
 main are these we will focus on her 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.670
 take out then, huh? 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.510
 we will power first time in five years 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.510
 Let's see what's going to happen. 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:51.449
 she takes a little look at this 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:55.110
 matter had 5 is looks is very little thing 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.780
 as if it were 5 having three joints there myself 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.550
 I think it should be practically 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.829
 now we have here sometimes 20 is one 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.010
 I mess up a little bigger, huh? 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:08.479
 Let's see what I see. 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.479
 It takes a little while to explode. 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:17.189
 Look, he already gave us a little ditch. 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.939
 it's going to be okay, right? 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:23.490
 requires a lot of your pc and is to do 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.950
 that the streets are cool right there 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.860
 now we go to times where it already makes a 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.890
 pretty damage here right? 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.770
 Let's put her here, let's go. 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.689
 put the torch 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:44.610
 This is going to do a gigantic havoc. 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:49.110
 here is going to give a basic brake 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:51.869
 andradinha ready is the one that went to 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:56.850
 Sometimes you can not imagine that 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:02:00.780
 500 times makes old man just looks until today 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:04.290
 that comes times without looking is very big 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.829
 and avc 57 square 20 times until 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.739
 moderate now times in gigantic aura 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:13.000
 Let's go here and do a steal with the 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.940
 instead of the 500 you still have 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.010
 Let's destroy the forest here so I 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.660
 I can put it half as far from it because 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.410
 I already know the damage of this bomb and so 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.290
 you will realize that it will give a 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:29.380
 Locked but my computer is 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:34.990
 even then let's catch the 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:35.590
 Minecraft, my god, give this shit. 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.430

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.920
 But he will release the bomb. 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.080
 My God does not want to release the bomb. 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:03.160
 fucking hell, look what the bomb made me 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.660
 I said that ending the forest is 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.680
 where I put it I put it there more or 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:10.390
 less here and she got this area 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.480
 whole old man looks at the 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.790
 it does and last and we will test the 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.730
 rest of the pumps that way is pretty cool 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.850
 There you are a professional miner. 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.220

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.330
 one she escapes down from the earth 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.959
 There is one that she makes a month that hell 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:45.160
 There is another one that multiplies itself. 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.329
 still missing once playing several 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.510

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:53.530

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:56.590

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:09.400
 Beauty, you're going to do it here in the house, do not do it. 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:15.040
 a basic basic here pretty basic 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:17.200
 The same little house has nothing to do with a 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.579
 very basic house with windows and everything 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.799

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.979
 I just think I hear that lookout 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.979

 furnace a daycare had a bed bugged 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.340
 Not for a change. 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.160
 I think that who was in the creative but 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.670

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:55.180
 Beauty, we do not have the house anymore, and let's go 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.980

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:04.990

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.440

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:26.020
