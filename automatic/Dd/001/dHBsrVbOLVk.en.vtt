00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:08.130
 hello and welcome on how 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.780
 photograph points like today 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.670
 many asked me what is that 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.490
 it was that what was under my 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.690
 camera it's a grip so I 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.049
 will explain to you what it is that the 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.140
 grip 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:24.570
 the grip is a tool that we will come 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:27.029
 fix under the camera on 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.619
 the camera he's going to have a virtue 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.210
 first it'll be a double the 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.059
 battery capacity because at 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.280
 interior 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:36.360
 I have two batteries that go to 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.690
 inside and what gives me a 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.430
 dual autonomy to the device 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.620
 if I had a battery inside 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.690
 housing 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.210
 so that's the main interest of the grip 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.969
 it is to have a double capacity in 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.730
 terms of file then the second 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:57.719
 grip advantage 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.739
 it's having double orders it's 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.020
 to say that I have orders to do 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.370
 horizontal format photos and I have some 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.769
 remote commands to make 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.939
 photos in vertical format 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:07.260
 it's still very interesting 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.820
 I loved knurling I have all my 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.740
 orders I even have orders here 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.420
 who are deported who allows me 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.549
 to use the camera too 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.220
 comfortably be able to adjust in 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.960
 vertical as in horizontal exactly 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.310
 this is very important for the 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.560
 grip 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.310
 then the grip will have some 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.380
 cons 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.509
 there is in terms of weight that comes 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.110
 seriously weigh down the device 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.110
 two batteries 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.340
 we have everything a handful 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.320
 extra that weighs down 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.740
 the camera so that's to take 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.180
 into account 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.140
 after that it depends on what you 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.520
 want it depends on your choices manage me 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.229
 I made the choice to learn a gray 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.280
 because I read from drums and that's 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.079
 still more convenient to have the 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.979
 remote commands 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:48.360
 then you have flus that go 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.860
 exist but that will not necessarily 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.390
 a capacity in terms of batteries 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.340
 will not be there to have a battery 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.740
 extra and are here to have a 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.350
 wifi connection for example we serve as 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.719
 wi-fi radio connectors for 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.409
 communicate between a computer and your 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.210
 camera 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.220
 I was here 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.320
 in outline what will serve 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.710
 a grip by cons there are a lot of 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.420
 brands 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.730
 I prefer to buy the grip of the 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.390
 brand of the camera after that is 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.730
 not an obligation 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.020
 you have a whole lot of brand 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.580
 generic that makes flus 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.110
 so it will be up to you to make your choice 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.050
 and see that according to your 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.860
 wishes for your budget this was it 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.989
 everything for the grip 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.860
 do not hesitate to go if you look 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.900
