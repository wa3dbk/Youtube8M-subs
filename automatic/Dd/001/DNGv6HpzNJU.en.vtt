00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
one by one it's easy the second thing I

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.990 
one by one it's easy the second thing I
wanted<00:00:31.140> to<00:00:31.260> mention<00:00:31.380> is<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:32.040> read<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.850> read

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
wanted to mention is the read the read

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.110 
wanted to mention is the read the read
is<00:00:33.329> basically<00:00:34.280> cilona<00:00:35.280> or<00:00:35.430> let's<00:00:35.610> say<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.730> Korea

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
is basically cilona or let's say a Korea
