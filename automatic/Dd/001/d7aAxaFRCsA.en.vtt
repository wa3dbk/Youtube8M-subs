00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
accurate to their original film and I

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.940 
accurate to their original film and I
know<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.740> I<00:01:08.010> tried<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:09.240> like<00:01:09.420> make<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:10.650> fins

know that I tried to like make the fins

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.240

on<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.310> side<00:01:11.490> of<00:01:11.520> his<00:01:11.700> face<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.750> then<00:01:13.250> that

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
on the side of his face and then that

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.880 
on the side of his face and then that
one<00:01:14.490> spike<00:01:14.939> up<00:01:15.119> here<00:01:15.479> but<00:01:16.380> it<00:01:16.470> looks<00:01:16.500> more<00:01:16.770> like

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
one spike up here but it looks more like

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.170 
one spike up here but it looks more like
a<00:01:16.920> dragon

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.580 

it's<00:01:20.780> more<00:01:20.930> like<00:01:20.990> a<00:01:21.140> dragon<00:01:21.500> so<00:01:21.710> yeah<00:01:23.560> but<00:01:24.560> I

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
it's more like a dragon so yeah but I

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.260 
it's more like a dragon so yeah but I
think<00:01:24.950> it<00:01:25.070> I<00:01:25.250> think<00:01:25.280> it<00:01:25.640> kind<00:01:26.030> of<00:01:26.150> represents

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
think it I think it kind of represents

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.670 
think it I think it kind of represents
varun<00:01:27.140> just<00:01:27.830> anyway<00:01:28.250> if<00:01:28.580> you<00:01:28.730> look<00:01:28.910> at<00:01:29.060> of<00:01:29.210> it

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
varun just anyway if you look at of it

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.770 
varun just anyway if you look at of it
if<00:01:30.680> you<00:01:30.830> just<00:01:30.950> look<00:01:31.250> at<00:01:31.460> them<00:01:31.580> this<00:01:32.060> kind<00:01:32.600> of

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
if you just look at them this kind of

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.780 
if you just look at them this kind of
represents<00:01:33.410> bearing<00:01:35.650> but<00:01:36.650> it's<00:01:37.400> just<00:01:37.640> like<00:01:37.760> a

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
represents bearing but it's just like a

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.980 
represents bearing but it's just like a
representation<00:01:38.540> it's<00:01:39.020> not<00:01:39.170> I'm<00:01:39.440> sure<00:01:39.680> I<00:01:39.710> tried

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
representation it's not I'm sure I tried

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.770 
representation it's not I'm sure I tried
but<00:01:41.990> I<00:01:42.400> know<00:01:43.400> it's<00:01:43.940> not<00:01:44.210> that<00:01:44.570> accurate

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
but I know it's not that accurate

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.120 
but I know it's not that accurate
looking<00:01:45.410> I<00:01:46.420> try<00:01:47.420> to<00:01:47.450> do<00:01:48.020> that<00:01:48.170> I<00:01:48.229> i<00:01:48.380> started

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
over on that I a few times but I finally

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.400 
over on that I a few times but I finally
got<00:01:51.770> it<00:01:52.270> so<00:01:53.270> yeah<00:01:55.479> and<00:01:56.479> if<00:01:56.660> you<00:01:56.750> don't<00:01:56.930> like<00:01:57.020> it

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
that's fine i mean i like it I think I

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.100 
that's fine i mean i like it I think I
did<00:02:00.500> a<00:02:00.530> pretty<00:02:00.590> good<00:02:00.979> job<00:02:01.040> on<00:02:01.280> it<00:02:01.580> and<00:02:02.110> you

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
did a pretty good job on it and you

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.240 
did a pretty good job on it and you
don't<00:02:03.229> even<00:02:03.410> have<00:02:03.590> to<00:02:03.649> think<00:02:03.770> of<00:02:04.040> it<00:02:04.130> as

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
don't even have to think of it as

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.710 
don't even have to think of it as
variant<00:02:04.640> you<00:02:04.759> can<00:02:04.880> use<00:02:05.000> think<00:02:05.210> of<00:02:05.300> it<00:02:05.450> as<00:02:05.540> some

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
variant you can use think of it as some

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.729 
variant you can use think of it as some
kind<00:02:05.750> of<00:02:05.930> clay<00:02:06.170> monster<00:02:08.200> but<00:02:09.200> I<00:02:09.229> think<00:02:09.619> it

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
kind of clay monster but I think it

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:11.820 
kind of clay monster but I think it
represents<00:02:09.890> varying<00:02:10.610> a<00:02:10.670> little<00:02:10.940> bit<00:02:11.090> just

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
represents varying a little bit just

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.570 
represents varying a little bit just
with<00:02:12.830> like<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:13.370> spikes<00:02:14.239> right<00:02:14.720> here<00:02:15.170> and<00:02:15.680> the

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
with like the spikes right here and the

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.640 
with like the spikes right here and the
fins<00:02:16.820> on<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.120> side<00:02:17.300> of<00:02:17.330> his<00:02:17.510> face<00:02:17.720> it<00:02:18.080> they<00:02:18.620> I

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
fins on the side of his face it they I

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.620 
fins on the side of his face it they I
realized<00:02:19.370> that<00:02:19.489> they<00:02:19.640> were<00:02:19.700> more<00:02:19.940> down<00:02:20.300> bored

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
realized that they were more down bored

that<00:05:14.370> I<00:05:14.400> would<00:05:14.939> make<00:05:15.120> but<00:05:15.569> I<00:05:15.780> don't<00:05:15.960> know<00:05:16.050> how

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199 
that I would make but I don't know how

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:17.570 
that I would make but I don't know how
he<00:05:16.259> would<00:05:16.530> go<00:05:16.710> in<00:05:16.860> it<00:05:17.009> because<00:05:17.159> he<00:05:17.280> has<00:05:17.400> no

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
he would go in it because he has no

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.469 
he would go in it because he has no
articulation<00:05:18.150> whatsoever<00:05:20.120> he's<00:05:21.120> Baron<00:05:21.419> he

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 
articulation whatsoever he's Baron he

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:25.730 
articulation whatsoever he's Baron he
doesn't<00:05:21.780> need<00:05:21.900> any<00:05:22.110> articulation<00:05:24.590> so<00:05:25.590> the

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
doesn't need any articulation so the

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.149 
doesn't need any articulation so the
next<00:05:25.919> Monster<00:05:26.370> I<00:05:26.400> might<00:05:26.610> make<00:05:27.919> I'm<00:05:28.919> probably

00:05:29.149 --> 00:05:29.159 
next Monster I might make I'm probably

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:31.459 
next Monster I might make I'm probably
going<00:05:29.370> to<00:05:29.460> make<00:05:29.580> gorusuruz<00:05:30.150> but<00:05:31.020> that's<00:05:31.379> very

00:05:31.459 --> 00:05:31.469 
going to make gorusuruz but that's very

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:34.189 
going to make gorusuruz but that's very
unlikely<00:05:32.039> because<00:05:32.629> I've<00:05:33.629> tried<00:05:33.780> making<00:05:34.139> a

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:34.199 
unlikely because I've tried making a

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:36.709 
unlikely because I've tried making a
two-legged<00:05:34.800> monster<00:05:35.550> before<00:05:35.819> and<00:05:36.389> it<00:05:36.569> just

00:05:36.709 --> 00:05:36.719 
two-legged monster before and it just

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:43.189 
two-legged monster before and it just
did<00:05:36.870> not<00:05:36.900> turn<00:05:37.259> out<00:05:37.440> good<00:05:39.949> so<00:05:40.949> yeah<00:05:41.400> and<00:05:42.199> the

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 
did not turn out good so yeah and the

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:46.520 
did not turn out good so yeah and the
color<00:05:43.440> is<00:05:43.560> not<00:05:43.949> accurate<00:05:44.159> either<00:05:45.319> Barons<00:05:46.319> I

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.530
