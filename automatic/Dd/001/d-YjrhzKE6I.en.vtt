00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
the line too much it's best to go a

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:05.610 
the line too much it's best to go a
little<00:01:00.519> outside<00:01:00.789> and<00:01:01.210> not<00:01:01.299> too<00:01:01.510> far<00:01:04.440> okay

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:05.620

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:14.259 
it's cut well enough move on to the

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:17.249 
it's cut well enough move on to the
2-liter<00:01:15.039> bottle<00:01:15.780> right<00:01:16.780> here<00:01:16.840> where<00:01:17.170> the

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:17.259 
2-liter bottle right here where the

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.679 
2-liter bottle right here where the
label<00:01:17.590> is<00:01:18.570> where<00:01:19.570> we<00:01:19.659> made<00:01:19.840> a<00:01:19.869> mark<00:01:20.140> wanting<00:01:20.859> to

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
label is where we made a mark wanting to

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.020 
label is where we made a mark wanting to
make<00:01:22.689> a<00:01:22.719> slice<00:01:23.109> into<00:01:23.590> the<00:01:23.680> bottle<00:01:23.979> gonna<00:01:24.820> leave

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
make a slice into the bottle gonna leave

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.029 
make a slice into the bottle gonna leave
the<00:01:25.240> lid<00:01:25.750> on<00:01:26.079> while<00:01:26.350> you<00:01:26.439> make<00:01:26.619> the<00:01:26.770> slice

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:27.039 
the lid on while you make the slice

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:28.679 
the lid on while you make the slice
because<00:01:27.759> that<00:01:28.090> gives<00:01:28.210> you<00:01:28.299> enough<00:01:28.450> pressure

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:28.689 
because that gives you enough pressure

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:30.330 
because that gives you enough pressure
that<00:01:28.990> the<00:01:29.140> knife<00:01:29.289> can<00:01:29.469> poke<00:01:29.680> through<00:01:29.920> so<00:01:30.219> the

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
that the knife can poke through so the

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.349 
that the knife can poke through so the
bottle<00:01:30.609> doesn't<00:01:30.789> cave<00:01:31.060> in<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:32.770> just<00:01:33.359> cut

00:01:34.349 --> 00:01:34.359 
bottle doesn't cave in you just cut

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:39.929 
bottle doesn't cave in you just cut
along<00:01:34.450> the<00:01:35.020> label<00:01:35.380> a<00:01:36.299> pair<00:01:37.299> of<00:01:37.329> scissors<00:01:38.939> okay

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:39.939 
along the label a pair of scissors okay

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:42.709 
along the label a pair of scissors okay
we<00:01:40.329> can<00:01:40.479> discard<00:01:40.810> this<00:01:41.079> use<00:01:41.560> it<00:01:41.770> as<00:01:41.890> final

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:42.719
