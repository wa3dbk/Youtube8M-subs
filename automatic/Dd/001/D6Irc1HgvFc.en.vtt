00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.519
 hi all hello with you crazy ted and welcome 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.170
 mine craft mechanisms and 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:17.430
 today I will show you this 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:21.340
 wonderful mechanism namely the bridge 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.080
 two blocks wide and 4 blocks long 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.019
 In general, finally, yes, yes I have 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.390
 time to record a video for you 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.159
 without music part of the fungus on the exam as 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.890
 to me, that is, zack was in general 

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:35.260
 today and from now on we will be with you 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.640
 seen much more often in general in honor 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.600
 this one is so big and 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:42.039
 presentable mechanism I will show you and 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.559
 build my whole naturally will not 

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:46.420
 I'll leave a link to the card with this 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:48.210
 mechanism in the description of this video you 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.640
 you can download it and see 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.769
 feel so to speak here but before 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.019
 how are we going to build from one of his 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:58.000
 parts so that I could at least a little 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:00.730
 explain how it does work 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.489
 how is he still built here before this 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:06.880
 all the same, I'll show you first in general 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:09.740
 by clicking on the button we 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.840
 advances accordingly our bridge by 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.509
 which we can quietly walk 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.310
 up here naturally should essentially be 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:20.259
 good but since I have wool she 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:25.329
 just burn so here we have water 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:25.329
 means on the reverse side also with us 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:32.210
 the bridge moves in completely 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.479
 also moved from the same side 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.520
 cause in general as you understood 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.110
 it works completely from both 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.649
 parties that is a very good bridge 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.539
 he takes here so much space yes it 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:46.459
 looks really very much but he 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:49.880
 essentially very compact because 

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:50.830
 See here one three three 4 5 4 blocks 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.090
 tall 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.939
 there is a mechanism itself that is it 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.939
 really well, just pennies can 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:01.250
 say for the mechanism of such a planned 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:04.130
 Well, in principle, it is not so big 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.229
 just here so here with two 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.890
 sides of the buttons advanced and 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.280
 moved in 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.709
 I decided to add this bridge 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.200
 the red part here is that 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:18.410
 red wool is already an extension to 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.870
 here is on both sides of the rock while working in 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.880
 In general, in principle, I have already told a lot 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.370
 so let's move on to one of his 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.440
 four parts will build one of 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.630
 four parts 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.090
 I'll explain it to you soon 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.459
 why exactly four out means 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:37.660
 we put here such a pillar three blocks high 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:41.000
 we select these blocks here we put the block and 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:44.750
 here is such a half block now like this 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.200
 here is a couple of blocks we also put a block 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.090
 not here yet from taverns here and here 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.490
 here in general, then you should have 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.650
 such is the construction here in the video 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.790
 do not confuse nick here block clean 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.530
 now here is a piece based here 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.640
 Repeater Repeater Repeater 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.730
 a delay of 1 click 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.570
 here here is a piece of redstone here 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.460
 red torch 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:10.640
 so here you should get 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:15.110
 here we have a sticky plunger 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:17.330
 here is another sticky plunger here and 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.630
 there are still 2 sticky pistons 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:25.220
 and here we must have a stove immediately 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:26.990
 put here still can lay a piece 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:31.480
 relaxed and here we will have 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:35.810
 the lever is like this here 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.410
 places like this low blocks here red 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.760
 torch 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:43.840
 block still here is another block should 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.910
 put here a red torch 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:49.540
 repeater without delay and here still 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:54.620
 one repeater delay of 1 click 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:57.920
 so now from here to here we 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.750
 we put a block here repeater on 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.550
 maximum delay here is sticky 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:03.740
 the piston which will take just 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:07.250
 yet this block so we and not 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:09.520
 broke now two blocks here two pieces 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:13.430
 Rostov on red torch 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.060
 now here so here are three blocks block 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.239
 still here 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:20.060
 block here here is a piece of red necessary 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:22.760
 Naturally 2 repeaters one of 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:26.270
 which delay maximum one without 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.620
 delays here the pieces of the table she's here so 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:31.669
 that's worth you 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:36.470
 two blocks on them red torch and here 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:39.770
 block also two more blocks here so well 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:42.620
 all in theory, that is, except for this miracle 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.840
 here we have such a block one more block 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.540
 here and a bit happy again now everything is exactly 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:50.350
 it is possible to close everything that is so 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:54.310
 you will have a wall also deal here 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:57.590
 here you can do something like this 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.870
 elevator published and that's it 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:03.740
 it closes and the floor is set here 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:05.810
 so that the signal does not break that's all 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.650
 closes then in short like this 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.770
 now already 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:12.289
 close since I started you all do here 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:15.949
 that is, I think you guessed it 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:18.710
 it will be here, this part here it is and 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:22.240
 pushing the lever we push this 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:24.979
 bridge and also moves in here 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:28.729
 correspondingly symmetrical to this part 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:31.010
 is being built and 2 that is, to be ours already 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:33.139
 the brain is not in one block exactly at 2 we also 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:36.260
 before the fear here there that is set 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:39.260
 a piece of red but there is such a block here 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:41.330
 one more block will be so repeater well then 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:43.880
 have you understood also finish building 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.960
 symmetrical and the second part 3 sticky 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.539
 pistons are put 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:51.410
 also put a sticky plunger bill here 

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:53.300
 here the site these blocks on in general leaves and 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:56.060
 that is, the second one is also being completed. 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:58.400
 part and accordingly already when you 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:01.669
 have you got so there 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:03.289
 put forward two blocks of thick bridge and 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:05.630
 accordingly on the other hand you do 

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:08.090
 so that even these 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:10.250
 four blocks but on the other hand 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:13.220
 there is why i showed you everything 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.970
 only one quarter of this 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:18.009
 mechanism that is 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:20.050
 1 quarter of this mechanism and all 

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:21.970
 the rest that is these improvements with 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.990
 With a button, I already said this 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:25.569
 the red part 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:27.699
 wool you and me you can her 

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:30.039
 see how it works from what it is 

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:35.560
 it works maybe even try 

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:38.530
 sort it out so we won't 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:41.710
 so much time you will not take a 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:45.190
 then we will have a mechanism for half an hour so 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:48.280
 that here in general, the link in the description is not 

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:50.259
 forgetting and thank you all for 

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:52.240
 view put your thumbs up 

00:06:50.259 --> 00:06:55.000
 up comment subscribe on 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:57.310
 my channel also don't forget about the band 

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.669
 VKontakte in which all the news goes 

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:02.770
 by video releases that is from and once 

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:05.139
 the video will not come out then be sure to 

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:07.659
 the news will be right there and you can 

00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:09.969
 find out about it so that 's it with 

00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:14.159
 you have been a loan to all good to all bye 

00:07:09.969 --> 00:07:14.159
 see you in the next part
