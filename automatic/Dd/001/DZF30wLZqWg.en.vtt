now<00:00:05.970> I'm<00:00:06.089> guessing<00:00:06.480> you<00:00:06.569> were<00:00:06.600> taught<00:00:06.930> to

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
now I'm guessing you were taught to

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.720 
now I'm guessing you were taught to
drive<00:00:07.290> with<00:00:07.560> your<00:00:07.680> hands<00:00:07.950> at<00:00:08.220> ten<00:00:08.490> and<00:00:08.519> two

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
drive with your hands at ten and two

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.450 
drive with your hands at ten and two
it's<00:00:09.480> been<00:00:09.719> driving<00:00:10.260> schools<00:00:10.590> dictum<00:00:11.190> for

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
it's been driving schools dictum for

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.520 
it's been driving schools dictum for
decades<00:00:11.969> kind<00:00:12.300> of<00:00:12.389> what<00:00:12.480> I'm<00:00:12.570> doing<00:00:12.870> here<00:00:13.139> you

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
decades kind of what I'm doing here you

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.470 
decades kind of what I'm doing here you
got<00:00:13.679> this<00:00:13.799> big<00:00:14.099> leverage<00:00:14.790> at<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.059> top<00:00:15.269> of<00:00:15.420> the

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
got this big leverage at the top of the

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.410 
got this big leverage at the top of the
wheel<00:00:16.279> and<00:00:17.279> one<00:00:17.789> of<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:17.970> things<00:00:18.180> that<00:00:18.300> was

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
wheel and one of the things that was

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.120 
wheel and one of the things that was
good<00:00:18.570> about<00:00:18.810> 10<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.230> 2<00:00:19.380> is<00:00:19.529> it<00:00:19.650> gave<00:00:19.830> you<00:00:19.949> this

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
good about 10 and 2 is it gave you this

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.310 
good about 10 and 2 is it gave you this
big<00:00:20.369> kind<00:00:20.580> of<00:00:20.699> cranking<00:00:21.330> force<00:00:21.630> up<00:00:21.900> here<00:00:22.140> like

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
big kind of cranking force up here like

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.140 
big kind of cranking force up here like
you're<00:00:22.500> sawing<00:00:22.890> away<00:00:23.130> at<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.460> wheel<00:00:23.609> of<00:00:24.029> a

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
you're sawing away at the wheel of a

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.050 
you're sawing away at the wheel of a
ship<00:00:26.180> but<00:00:27.180> that<00:00:27.210> was<00:00:27.599> then<00:00:28.880> starting<00:00:29.880> in<00:00:29.939> the

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
ship but that was then starting in the

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.880 
ship but that was then starting in the
80s<00:00:30.390> cars<00:00:30.900> began<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.410> come<00:00:31.590> with<00:00:31.740> power

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
80s cars began to come with power

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.310 
80s cars began to come with power
steering<00:00:32.309> almost<00:00:32.940> universally<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:34.110> that

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
steering almost universally and that

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.690 
steering almost universally and that
changes<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.770> lot<00:00:34.980> of<00:00:35.130> things<00:00:35.309> about<00:00:35.399> how<00:00:35.640> you

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
changes a lot of things about how you

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.819 
changes a lot of things about how you
address<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.300> wheel<00:00:36.480> if<00:00:36.960> anything<00:00:37.500> steering

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
address the wheel if anything steering

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.110 
address the wheel if anything steering
in<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.010> 80s<00:00:38.309> didn't<00:00:38.520> really<00:00:38.670> matter<00:00:38.850> where

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
in the 80s didn't really matter where

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.790 
in the 80s didn't really matter where
you<00:00:39.239> put<00:00:39.420> your<00:00:39.600> hands<00:00:40.020> starting<00:00:40.440> then<00:00:40.620> you

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
you put your hands starting then you

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.770 
you put your hands starting then you
could<00:00:40.980> operate<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.760> car<00:00:42.000> steering<00:00:42.390> with<00:00:42.600> the

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
could operate the car steering with the

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.810 
could operate the car steering with the
least<00:00:43.020> effort<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.860> could<00:00:43.980> drape<00:00:44.340> your<00:00:44.550> wrist

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
least effort you could drape your wrist

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.940 
least effort you could drape your wrist
over<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.239> top<00:00:45.510> you<00:00:45.750> can<00:00:45.899> steer<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.410> down<00:00:46.620> here

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
over the top you can steer it down here

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.860 
over the top you can steer it down here
with<00:00:47.100> one<00:00:47.309> finger<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.969> classic<00:00:48.420> kind<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.690> big

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
with one finger the classic kind of big

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.260 
with one finger the classic kind of big
American<00:00:49.350> car<00:00:49.590> thing<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.489> people<00:00:50.760> really<00:00:51.120> got

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
American car thing and people really got

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.850 
American car thing and people really got
sloppy<00:00:51.600> about<00:00:51.960> where<00:00:52.140> they<00:00:52.260> put<00:00:52.469> their<00:00:52.649> hands

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
sloppy about where they put their hands

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.990 
sloppy about where they put their hands
too<00:00:53.129> many<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.430> them<00:00:53.550> just<00:00:54.000> do<00:00:54.120> this<00:00:56.000> starting

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
too many of them just do this starting

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.970 
too many of them just do this starting
in<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.210> 90s<00:00:57.719> its<00:00:57.899> power<00:00:58.109> steering<00:00:58.649> evolves

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
in the 90s its power steering evolves

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.590 
in the 90s its power steering evolves
it's<00:00:59.280> not<00:00:59.460> so<00:00:59.699> numb<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.329> dumbs

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
it's not so numb and dumbs

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.170 
it's not so numb and dumbs
variable-ratio<00:01:01.559> that<00:01:02.309> means<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.789> requires<00:01:03.090> a

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
variable-ratio that means it requires a

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.090 
variable-ratio that means it requires a
different<00:01:03.270> number<00:01:03.750> of<00:01:03.780> turns<00:01:04.170> to<00:01:04.409> navigate

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
different number of turns to navigate

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.859 
different number of turns to navigate
the<00:01:05.250> lanes<00:01:05.460> at<00:01:05.729> speed<00:01:06.000> than<00:01:06.450> when<00:01:06.659> you're

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
the lanes at speed than when you're

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.020 
the lanes at speed than when you're
parking<00:01:07.470> for<00:01:07.680> example<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.760> steering

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
parking for example the steering

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.300 
parking for example the steering
movement<00:01:09.659> from<00:01:09.900> lock<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.140> lock<00:01:10.380> is<00:01:10.920> much

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
movement from lock to lock is much

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.420 
movement from lock to lock is much
smaller<00:01:11.750> this<00:01:12.750> reduces<00:01:13.320> accordingly<00:01:13.890> the

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
smaller this reduces accordingly the

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.490 
smaller this reduces accordingly the
steering<00:01:14.820> effort<00:01:15.119> required<00:01:15.570> during<00:01:16.380> the

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
steering effort required during the

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.830 
steering effort required during the
entire<00:01:16.860> parking<00:01:17.430> maneuvers<00:01:17.939> but<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.630> big

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
entire parking maneuvers but the big

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.350 
entire parking maneuvers but the big
change<00:01:19.140> is<00:01:19.470> in<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:20.130> 90s<00:01:20.490> we<00:01:20.610> start<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:20.970> get<00:01:21.060> air

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
change is in the 90s we start to get air

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.899 
change is in the 90s we start to get air
bags

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:26.789 

and<00:01:25.420> they<00:01:25.540> show<00:01:25.780> up<00:01:25.899> everywhere<00:01:26.259> in<00:01:26.500> the<00:01:26.619> car

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 
and they show up everywhere in the car

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:28.080 
and they show up everywhere in the car
eventually<00:01:27.130> but<00:01:27.399> the<00:01:27.549> one<00:01:27.789> that<00:01:27.909> we're

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
eventually but the one that we're

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.760 
eventually but the one that we're
concerned<00:01:28.390> about<00:01:28.570> is<00:01:28.840> this<00:01:29.079> guy<00:01:29.289> this<00:01:29.560> high

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
concerned about is this guy this high

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.590 
concerned about is this guy this high
explosive<00:01:30.460> staring<00:01:30.789> you<00:01:30.880> square<00:01:31.210> in<00:01:31.329> the<00:01:31.420> face

explosive staring you square in the face

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.289 
explosive staring you square in the face
all<00:01:32.049> the<00:01:32.409> time<00:01:32.439> this<00:01:33.130> demands<00:01:33.610> a<00:01:33.970> new

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299 
all the time this demands a new

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:39.390 
all the time this demands a new
discipline<00:01:34.780> of<00:01:34.960> how<00:01:35.049> you<00:01:35.110> hold<00:01:35.409> the<00:01:35.560> wheel
