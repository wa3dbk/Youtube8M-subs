00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.900
 hello undoubtedly the systems 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.660
 important of the previous topic are the 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.760
 shutter speed and aperture 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.949
 but the complexity of those lies in 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.869
 that can not be separated since both are 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:25.699
 compensate has a value for 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.320
 understand them completely must 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:30.810
 perform the following exercise 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.850
 always keep in mind the following table 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.910
 and pay attention to all 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.250
 steps using your camera 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.410
 It can be a semi professional camera 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.200
 professional or compact that has 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.330
 manual mode locate it on a triple or 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.000
 a flat and stable surface in the 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:51.269
 which you can not move during the whole 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.920
 exercise for this exercise is 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:56.730
 requires you to configure your camera 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.800
 photographic in manual mode the exercise 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.070
 you must make it a day to take advantage of 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.230
 sunlight 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.390
 in box a motif of your choice can 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.070
 be a landscape a tree a statue 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.470
 anything and the animated one that wants 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.350
 photographing in this exercise avoids 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.390
 photographing animals or people remember 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.420
 do not die the camera during all the 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.580
 exercise 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.560
 to start, set the speed of 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:24.890
 your camera in a second and the diaphragm 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.990
 in four and take the first picture 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.170
 then without moving the speed of a 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:33.740
 second change the diaphragm to 6.3 and take 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:36.170
 the second photo then to 7.1 and take the 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.540
 third and so on as what 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:45.080
 indicates the table seen in the step of the 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:48.159
 fragma days that will be 46.3 7.1 of 10 14 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.960
 and 22 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.210
 keep in mind that the values â€‹â€‹of 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.130
 diaphragm and speed may vary from 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.140
 one camera to another if this happens to you 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.780
 use the number most similar to your 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.359
 camera allow for example if it is to take 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.619
 the photo with a diaphragm 4 and your camera 

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:06.009
 does not allow it to the nearest 3.5 or 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.470
 5.6 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.539
 also with the shutter speed 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.340
 at the time of applying step 9 you must 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.319
 modify the excell file 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.500
 replacing the diaphragm number that 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:19.840
 there was the one that you finally used 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.030
 after taking all the pictures with 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.090
 one second speed change this to 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.500
 0.5 seconds and start again with 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:32.860
 10.4 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:36.150
 then 6.3 7.1 10 14 and 22 as 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.650
 indicates the table seen in the hard step 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.850
 undo this until you have crossed all 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.410
 the fragments with all the 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.410
 speeds shown in the table 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.450
 then download the pictures in a 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.069
 computer and proceed to insert each one 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.459
 of them in the corresponding box 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:57.290
 in the excel file attached 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.290
 speed table by its diaphragm
