00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
make a quick video before I went to

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.690 
make a quick video before I went to
sleep<00:00:06.589> since<00:00:07.589> I<00:00:07.680> haven't<00:00:07.950> made<00:00:08.040> a<00:00:08.099> video<00:00:08.250> in<00:00:08.429> so

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.850 
long about and this video will be about
the<00:00:11.429> neurology<00:00:12.090> of<00:00:12.300> language<00:00:13.110> learning<00:00:13.139> so

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
the neurology of language learning so

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.470 
the neurology of language learning so
since<00:00:14.280> I'm<00:00:14.400> a<00:00:14.490> medical<00:00:14.880> student<00:00:14.940> and

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
since I'm a medical student and

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.359 
since I'm a medical student and
medicines<00:00:16.379> also<00:00:16.529> an<00:00:16.710> interest<00:00:17.010> reminded

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
medicines also an interest reminded

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.099 
medicines also an interest reminded
meses<00:00:17.640> language<00:00:18.000> learning<00:00:18.210> I<00:00:18.449> wanted<00:00:19.020> to

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
meses language learning I wanted to

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.790 
meses language learning I wanted to
share<00:00:19.439> a<00:00:19.500> little<00:00:19.710> bit<00:00:20.010> about<00:00:20.490> how

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:21.800 
share a little bit about how

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.230 
share a little bit about how
neurologically<00:00:22.800> we<00:00:23.340> think<00:00:23.609> about<00:00:23.820> language

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
neurologically we think about language

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.929 
neurologically we think about language
and<00:00:24.390> how<00:00:24.660> our<00:00:25.170> brain<00:00:25.680> processes<00:00:26.400> language<00:00:26.550> and

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
and how our brain processes language and

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.730 
and how our brain processes language and
how<00:00:27.060> that<00:00:27.119> applies<00:00:27.689> and<00:00:27.990> I'm<00:00:28.199> only<00:00:28.410> speaking

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
how that applies and I'm only speaking

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.500 
how that applies and I'm only speaking
about<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.130> part<00:00:29.460> that<00:00:29.609> applies<00:00:29.910> to<00:00:29.939> us<00:00:30.150> as

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
about the part that applies to us as

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.389 
about the part that applies to us as
language<00:00:30.900> learners<00:00:31.260> this<00:00:32.040> might<00:00:32.279> be

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
language learners this might be

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.330 
language learners this might be
interesting<00:00:32.550> for<00:00:33.120> a<00:00:33.960> way<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.350> think<00:00:34.649> about<00:00:34.829> how

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
interesting for a way to think about how

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.970 
interesting for a way to think about how
you're<00:00:35.579> learning<00:00:35.910> languages<00:00:36.450> and<00:00:36.960> when<00:00:37.890> you

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
you're learning languages and when you

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.860 
you're learning languages and when you
think<00:00:38.129> about<00:00:38.219> how<00:00:38.610> your<00:00:38.790> brain<00:00:39.000> functions<00:00:39.600> I

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
think about how your brain functions I

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.690 
think about how your brain functions I
think<00:00:40.649> it's<00:00:40.770> two<00:00:41.100> things<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.489> go<00:00:41.640> together

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
think it's two things that go together

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.150 
think it's two things that go together
so<00:00:43.250> so<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.280> drew<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:45.120> picture<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.629> a<00:00:45.890> brain<00:00:46.890> it's

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
so so I drew a picture of a brain it's

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.510 
so so I drew a picture of a brain it's
not<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.489> best<00:00:47.760> picture<00:00:48.180> but<00:00:48.950> I'm<00:00:49.950> not<00:00:50.160> at<00:00:50.399> all

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
not the best picture but I'm not at all

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.279 
not the best picture but I'm not at all
an<00:00:50.670> artist<00:00:50.789> and<00:00:51.210> so<00:00:51.719> right<00:00:52.020> in<00:00:53.960> this<00:00:54.960> section

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
an artist and so right in this section

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.590 
an artist and so right in this section
there's<00:00:56.129> two<00:00:56.460> main<00:00:56.699> sections<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:57.329> will<00:00:57.449> be

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
there's two main sections that will be

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.020 
there's two main sections that will be
talking<00:00:58.020> about<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.530> a<00:00:59.399> connection<00:00:59.879> between

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
talking about and a connection between

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.670 
talking about and a connection between
them<00:01:01.609> so<00:01:02.609> in<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.850> temporal<00:01:03.539> lobe<00:01:03.780> right<00:01:04.110> here

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
them so in the temporal lobe right here

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.190 
them so in the temporal lobe right here
what<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.790> have<00:01:06.030> is<00:01:06.360> what's<00:01:07.020> called

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
what you have is what's called

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.160 
what you have is what's called
Wernicke's<00:01:07.830> area<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.460> was<00:01:08.580> discovered

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
Wernicke's area so it was discovered

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.460 
Wernicke's area so it was discovered
leave<00:01:10.170> by<00:01:10.320> German<00:01:10.860> scientist<00:01:11.490> wernicke<00:01:12.470> that

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
leave by German scientist wernicke that

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.100 
leave by German scientist wernicke that
this<00:01:13.680> area<00:01:14.010> was<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:15.060> receptive<00:01:15.659> area<00:01:15.990> of

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
this area was is the receptive area of

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.600 
this area was is the receptive area of
language<00:01:16.560> so<00:01:17.100> when<00:01:17.670> we're<00:01:17.909> speaking<00:01:18.680> and<00:01:19.680> when

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
language so when we're speaking and when

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.789 
language so when we're speaking and when
we're<00:01:20.820> listening<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.390> conversations<00:01:21.650> this<00:01:22.650> is

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
we're listening to conversations this is

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.429 
we're listening to conversations this is
the<00:01:22.920> area<00:01:23.130> that<00:01:23.450> understands<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:25.200> also

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
the area that understands and is also

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.420 
the area that understands and is also
spoken<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.250> sign<00:01:27.150> language<00:01:27.600> or<00:01:28.430> written

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
spoken and sign language or written

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.060 
spoken and sign language or written
speech<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:30.000> it's<00:01:30.509> proven<00:01:31.049> that<00:01:31.079> this<00:01:31.320> is<00:01:31.530> true

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
speech and it's proven that this is true

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.859 
speech and it's proven that this is true
with<00:01:32.549> people<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:32.939> strokes<00:01:33.479> and<00:01:33.720> when<00:01:33.810> you

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
with people that strokes and when you

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.840 
with people that strokes and when you
see<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.049> stroke<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.619> takes<00:01:34.950> out<00:01:35.159> this<00:01:35.340> area

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
see a stroke that takes out this area

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.969 
see a stroke that takes out this area
the<00:01:36.450> person<00:01:36.900> will<00:01:37.229> be<00:01:37.350> able<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.619> speak

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
the person will be able to speak

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.620 
the person will be able to speak
perfectly<00:01:38.490> fine<00:01:38.729> but<00:01:38.909> they<00:01:39.030> won't<00:01:39.240> make<00:01:39.390> too

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
perfectly fine but they won't make too

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.859 
perfectly fine but they won't make too
much<00:01:39.780> sense<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:40.380> be<00:01:40.829> able<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:41.040> produce<00:01:41.220> beach

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
much sense to be able to produce beach

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.330 
much sense to be able to produce beach
but<00:01:42.869> when<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.259> speak<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.710> them<00:01:43.860> or<00:01:44.009> ask<00:01:44.159> them

the<00:01:58.200> frontal<00:01:58.619> lobe<00:01:58.829> then<00:01:59.070> is<00:01:59.310> Broca's<00:02:00.000> area<00:02:00.600> so

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
the frontal lobe then is Broca's area so

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.920 
the frontal lobe then is Broca's area so
Broca's<00:02:01.950> area<00:02:02.430> is<00:02:02.729> where<00:02:03.210> you<00:02:03.420> produce<00:02:03.630> all

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
Broca's area is where you produce all

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.800 
Broca's area is where you produce all
the<00:02:03.960> speech<00:02:04.320> therefore<00:02:04.799> so<00:02:05.399> if<00:02:05.850> you<00:02:06.060> have<00:02:06.299> an

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
the speech therefore so if you have an

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.440 
the speech therefore so if you have an
area<00:02:07.290> that's<00:02:07.680> wrong<00:02:07.979> with<00:02:08.340> Broca's<00:02:09.090> area<00:02:09.360> and

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
area that's wrong with Broca's area and

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.330 
area that's wrong with Broca's area and
or<00:02:09.539> stroke<00:02:09.840> that<00:02:09.989> just<00:02:10.289> affects<00:02:10.679> primarily

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340

what<00:02:14.500> you<00:02:14.650> will<00:02:14.800> find<00:02:14.980> is<00:02:15.250> that<00:02:16.470> you<00:02:17.470> won't<00:02:17.620> be

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
what you will find is that you won't be

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.990 
what you will find is that you won't be
able<00:02:17.890> to<00:02:18.069> speak<00:02:18.310> at<00:02:18.520> all<00:02:18.610> the<00:02:18.819> person

able to speak at all the person

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.500 
able to speak at all the person
unfortunately<00:02:19.630> will<00:02:20.260> be<00:02:20.790> very<00:02:21.790> frustrated

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
unfortunately will be very frustrated

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.180 
unfortunately will be very frustrated
they<00:02:22.630> will<00:02:22.780> say<00:02:22.930> only<00:02:23.080> certain<00:02:23.590> words<00:02:23.890> and

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
they will say only certain words and

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:26.570 
they will say only certain words and
they'll<00:02:24.430> just<00:02:24.610> have<00:02:24.670> complete<00:02:25.530> trouble

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
they'll just have complete trouble

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.010 
they'll just have complete trouble
expressing<00:02:27.580> themselves<00:02:27.970> but<00:02:28.720> they'll<00:02:28.900> be

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
expressing themselves but they'll be

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.809 
expressing themselves but they'll be
able<00:02:29.110> to<00:02:29.260> understand<00:02:29.709> perfectly<00:02:30.010> so<00:02:30.610> if<00:02:30.730> you

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
able to understand perfectly so if you

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:32.160 
able to understand perfectly so if you
tell<00:02:31.030> them<00:02:31.239> give<00:02:31.540> them<00:02:31.660> commands<00:02:32.019> they'll

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
tell them give them commands they'll

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.229 
tell them give them commands they'll
understand<00:02:32.680> they<00:02:32.860> can<00:02:33.040> read<00:02:33.310> they<00:02:33.880> won't<00:02:34.120> be

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
understand they can read they won't be

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.710 
understand they can read they won't be
able<00:02:34.390> to<00:02:34.599> write<00:02:34.840> and<00:02:35.200> it's<00:02:35.860> really<00:02:36.130> weird<00:02:36.310> but

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
able to write and it's really weird but

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.780 
able to write and it's really weird but
that's<00:02:37.720> just<00:02:38.170> how<00:02:38.380> the<00:02:38.440> brain<00:02:38.680> works<00:02:38.739> and<00:02:39.160> then

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
that's just how the brain works and then

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.880 
that's just how the brain works and then
there's<00:02:39.970> an<00:02:40.330> arcuate<00:02:40.630> fasciculus<00:02:40.890> that

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
there's an arcuate fasciculus that

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.740 
there's an arcuate fasciculus that
connects<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:42.459> two<00:02:42.640> so<00:02:43.030> those<00:02:43.269> are<00:02:43.300> a<00:02:43.450> bunch<00:02:43.630> of

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
connects the two so those are a bunch of

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.350 
connects the two so those are a bunch of
white<00:02:43.989> matter<00:02:44.200> tracts<00:02:44.620> or<00:02:45.030> axons<00:02:46.030> that

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
white matter tracts or axons that

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.140 
white matter tracts or axons that
connect<00:02:47.350> one<00:02:47.650> area<00:02:48.010> to<00:02:48.220> the<00:02:48.340> others<00:02:48.760> that's

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
connect one area to the others that's

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.759 
connect one area to the others that's
the<00:02:49.360> communication<00:02:50.019> how<00:02:50.140> they<00:02:50.260> communicate

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
the communication how they communicate

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.470 
the communication how they communicate
and<00:02:51.569> so<00:02:52.860> but<00:02:53.860> you<00:02:54.190> might<00:02:54.370> ask<00:02:54.549> well<00:02:55.090> and<00:02:55.299> then

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
and so but you might ask well and then

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.839 
and so but you might ask well and then
this<00:02:55.840> is<00:02:55.900> on<00:02:56.260> actually<00:02:57.220> from<00:02:57.430> even<00:02:57.760> this

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
this is on actually from even this

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:59.490 
this is on actually from even this
perspective<00:02:58.150> it's<00:02:58.540> this<00:02:58.750> is<00:02:58.900> the<00:02:59.019> left<00:02:59.260> side

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
perspective it's this is the left side

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.530 
perspective it's this is the left side
of<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.799> brain<00:02:59.920> and<00:03:00.250> everyone<00:03:01.060> only<00:03:01.180> speaks

Broca's doesn't exist from me on the

Broca's doesn't exist from me on the

right to neither its Wernicke's but in
that<00:03:22.329> those<00:03:22.570> same<00:03:22.810> areas<00:03:23.079> I'll<00:03:23.590> have<00:03:23.799> a

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
that those same areas I'll have a

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:26.580 
that those same areas I'll have a
certain<00:03:24.250> areas<00:03:24.700> to<00:03:25.000> understand<00:03:25.390> more<00:03:25.600> prosody

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
certain areas to understand more prosody

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:30.150 
certain areas to understand more prosody
and<00:03:26.980> tone<00:03:27.609> pitch<00:03:28.030> musicality<00:03:28.810> and<00:03:29.200> so<00:03:29.980> for

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
and tone pitch musicality and so for

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.340 
and tone pitch musicality and so for
languages<00:03:30.640> or<00:03:31.000> and<00:03:31.630> that<00:03:31.810> which<00:03:31.930> is<00:03:31.959> a<00:03:32.140> very

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 
languages or and that which is a very

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.080 
languages or and that which is a very
important<00:03:32.859> part<00:03:33.040> of<00:03:33.160> language<00:03:33.549> and<00:03:33.730> which<00:03:33.940> is

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
important part of language and which is

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.259 
important part of language and which is
another<00:03:34.600> so<00:03:34.959> both<00:03:35.590> sides<00:03:35.620> are<00:03:36.160> important<00:03:37.090> too

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:37.269 
another so both sides are important too

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.319 
another so both sides are important too
so<00:03:37.660> if<00:03:37.930> I<00:03:38.079> want<00:03:38.410> to<00:03:38.709> be<00:03:39.010> able<00:03:39.130> to<00:03:39.430> speak<00:03:40.120> a

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
so if I want to be able to speak a

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:42.270 
so if I want to be able to speak a
language<00:03:40.480> well<00:03:40.870> and<00:03:41.019> develop<00:03:41.440> an<00:03:41.530> accent<00:03:42.010> I<00:03:42.220> do

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
language well and develop an accent I do

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.430 
language well and develop an accent I do
believe<00:03:42.730> you<00:03:42.970> both<00:03:43.389> hemispheres<00:03:43.660> have<00:03:44.200> to<00:03:44.350> be

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
believe you both hemispheres have to be

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.229 
believe you both hemispheres have to be
working<00:03:44.829> at<00:03:44.950> it<00:03:45.040> but<00:03:45.220> their<00:03:45.459> specialized<00:03:46.030> for

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
working at it but their specialized for

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:49.379 
working at it but their specialized for
different<00:03:46.269> things<00:03:46.569> and<00:03:47.049> that's<00:03:47.950> why<00:03:48.190> in<00:03:48.579> order

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:49.389 
different things and that's why in order

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:51.629 
different things and that's why in order
each<00:03:50.109> one<00:03:50.470> of<00:03:50.500> these<00:03:50.650> areas<00:03:51.040> the<00:03:51.400> brain

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:51.639 
each one of these areas the brain

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:54.140 
each one of these areas the brain
develops<00:03:51.850> in<00:03:52.359> different<00:03:52.840> differently<00:03:53.410> and

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
develops in different differently and

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.629 
develops in different differently and
you<00:03:55.150> have<00:03:55.299> to<00:03:55.420> practice<00:03:55.600> each<00:03:55.959> one<00:03:56.350> of<00:03:56.380> these

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:56.639 
you have to practice each one of these

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:00.569 
you have to practice each one of these
so<00:03:57.639> people<00:03:57.850> that<00:03:58.090> say<00:03:58.269> you<00:03:58.329> can<00:03:58.680> just<00:03:59.680> read

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:00.579 
so people that say you can just read

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:04.080 
so people that say you can just read
read<00:04:01.269> and<00:04:01.690> and<00:04:02.620> listen<00:04:03.130> or<00:04:03.250> just<00:04:03.519> speaking<00:04:03.970> or

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
read and and listen or just speaking or

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.449 
read and and listen or just speaking or
just<00:04:04.359> one<00:04:04.569> area<00:04:04.959> of<00:04:05.430> language<00:04:06.430> learning

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
just one area of language learning

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:08.550 
just one area of language learning
that's<00:04:07.030> enough<00:04:07.389> may<00:04:07.660> say<00:04:07.810> that's<00:04:08.019> them<00:04:08.230> up<00:04:08.350> you

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
that's enough may say that's them up you

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.900 
that's enough may say that's them up you
know<00:04:08.650> if<00:04:08.739> you<00:04:08.859> do<00:04:08.980> that<00:04:09.160> the<00:04:09.340> other<00:04:09.370> thing<00:04:09.760> will

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
know if you do that the other thing will

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.789 
know if you do that the other thing will
come<00:04:10.120> well<00:04:10.600> yes<00:04:10.750> you'll<00:04:10.900> get<00:04:11.049> better<00:04:11.319> at<00:04:11.650> the

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
come well yes you'll get better at the

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:13.229 
come well yes you'll get better at the
other<00:04:11.920> because<00:04:12.220> there<00:04:12.340> are<00:04:12.459> connections<00:04:12.850> it's

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:13.239 
other because there are connections it's

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:14.490 
other because there are connections it's
not<00:04:13.389> like<00:04:13.540> they're<00:04:13.690> not<00:04:13.780> connected<00:04:14.079> at<00:04:14.410> all

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
not like they're not connected at all

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.620 
not like they're not connected at all
but<00:04:14.980> if<00:04:15.069> you<00:04:15.160> truly<00:04:15.430> want<00:04:15.639> to<00:04:15.760> develop<00:04:16.090> in<00:04:16.419> all

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:16.630 
but if you truly want to develop in all

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.270 
but if you truly want to develop in all
aspects<00:04:17.229> of<00:04:17.229> progress<00:04:17.709> and<00:04:17.919> language

aspects of progress and language

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.390 
aspects of progress and language
learning<00:04:18.489> you<00:04:19.090> have<00:04:19.269> to<00:04:19.560> work<00:04:20.560> all<00:04:20.709> parts<00:04:21.340> of

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
learning you have to work all parts of

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.820 
learning you have to work all parts of
your<00:04:21.580> brain<00:04:21.760> which<00:04:22.210> means<00:04:23.110> you<00:04:23.229> have<00:04:23.349> to<00:04:23.380> speak

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
your brain which means you have to speak

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
cuz in order to speak you have to speak

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.840 
cuz in order to speak you have to speak

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
a lot you have to have lots of practice

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.400 
a lot you have to have lots of practice
in<00:04:31.000> order<00:04:31.180> to<00:04:31.300> be<00:04:31.420> able<00:04:31.510> to<00:04:31.630> understand<00:04:32.290> you

in order to be able to understand you

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:34.440 
in order to be able to understand you
have<00:04:32.530> to<00:04:32.620> listen<00:04:32.830> up<00:04:33.100> in<00:04:33.400> order<00:04:33.610> to<00:04:33.730> read

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
have to listen up in order to read

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.110 
have to listen up in order to read
rights<00:04:34.720> the<00:04:34.990> same<00:04:35.230> and<00:04:35.890> you<00:04:36.640> need<00:04:36.820> to<00:04:36.910> develop

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
rights the same and you need to develop

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.060 
rights the same and you need to develop
those<00:04:37.360> parts<00:04:37.810> of<00:04:38.080> the<00:04:38.350> brain<00:04:38.500> and<00:04:38.770> really

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
those parts of the brain and really

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.620 
those parts of the brain and really
develop<00:04:39.610> that<00:04:40.060> in<00:04:40.330> order<00:04:40.540> to<00:04:42.510> to<00:04:43.510> be

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
develop that in order to to be

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.110 
develop that in order to to be
proficient<00:04:43.990> in<00:04:44.530> your<00:04:44.800> target<00:04:45.160> languages<00:04:46.590> so

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
proficient in your target languages so

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.460 
proficient in your target languages so
really<00:04:49.120> there's<00:04:49.390> another<00:04:49.630> part<00:04:50.080> that's<00:04:50.350> in

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
really there's another part that's in

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:51.990 
really there's another part that's in
the<00:04:50.560> parietal<00:04:50.770> lobe<00:04:51.220> it's<00:04:51.610> the<00:04:51.700> super

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
the parietal lobe it's the super

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.430 
the parietal lobe it's the super
marginal<00:04:52.450> and<00:04:52.660> that<00:04:52.810> actually<00:04:53.290> has<00:04:53.410> been

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
marginal and that actually has been

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.800 
marginal and that actually has been
shown<00:04:53.950> just<00:04:54.580> as<00:04:54.700> this<00:04:55.090> is<00:04:55.270> just<00:04:55.450> a<00:04:55.510> side<00:04:55.690> that

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
shown just as this is just a side that

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:00.210 
shown just as this is just a side that
shows<00:04:57.870> that<00:04:58.870> shows<00:04:59.290> that<00:04:59.320> people<00:04:59.740> who<00:04:59.890> are

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:00.220 
shows that shows that people who are

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.400 
shows that shows that people who are
bilingual<00:05:00.490> I<00:05:01.240> think<00:05:01.720> there<00:05:01.870> was<00:05:01.960> a<00:05:01.990> study<00:05:02.260> that

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:02.410 
bilingual I think there was a study that

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:04.410 
bilingual I think there was a study that
showed<00:05:02.710> that<00:05:02.740> people<00:05:03.490> who<00:05:03.670> have<00:05:03.880> learned<00:05:04.210> no

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:04.420 
showed that people who have learned no

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:05.730 
showed that people who have learned no
more<00:05:04.660> than<00:05:04.780> language<00:05:05.110> more<00:05:05.440> than<00:05:05.620> one

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
more than language more than one

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.400 
more than language more than one
language<00:05:05.920> have<00:05:06.250> a<00:05:06.280> much<00:05:06.520> more<00:05:07.510> active<00:05:07.780> and<00:05:08.290> a

that but it's another interesting factor

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:27.180 
that but it's another interesting factor

this<00:05:27.400> is<00:05:27.550> a<00:05:27.580> this<00:05:28.060> was<00:05:28.300> a<00:05:28.330> basic<00:05:28.750> video<00:05:28.900> just

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.200 
this is a this was a basic video just

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:30.870 
this is a this was a basic video just
talking<00:05:29.500> about<00:05:29.560> a<00:05:29.680> little<00:05:29.950> bit<00:05:30.100> about<00:05:30.550> why<00:05:30.850> I

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
talking about a little bit about why I

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.600 
talking about a little bit about why I
believe<00:05:31.330> instead<00:05:32.080> of<00:05:32.110> focusing<00:05:32.380> on<00:05:32.800> just<00:05:33.280> one

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
believe instead of focusing on just one

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:35.460 
believe instead of focusing on just one
thing<00:05:33.850> just<00:05:34.240> you<00:05:34.480> know<00:05:34.660> you<00:05:34.720> need<00:05:34.930> to<00:05:35.050> speak<00:05:35.320> a

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:35.470 
thing just you know you need to speak a

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:37.560 
thing just you know you need to speak a
lot<00:05:35.590> or<00:05:35.950> if<00:05:36.220> you<00:05:36.310> need<00:05:36.460> a<00:05:36.490> lot<00:05:36.670> of<00:05:36.760> input<00:05:37.000> versus

lot or if you need a lot of input versus

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.900 
lot or if you need a lot of input versus
output<00:05:38.050> on<00:05:38.170> this<00:05:38.320> debate<00:05:38.650> I<00:05:38.890> think<00:05:39.340> you<00:05:39.430> need<00:05:39.550> I

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:39.910 
output on this debate I think you need I

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:42.450
