 in the always commented description 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.000
 let's grow up, they 're a little crazy and that's it 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:30.100
 there is nothing but in reality they are all 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.990

 his things is why I bring you as 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.730
 the slag or really was 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.510
 and if the videos on the internet never 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.820
 they lie and it seems that Koreans have 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.450

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.690
 that that really is a and nine or another 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.690

 they also have shaped android 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.340

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.930
 where are they reading this baby 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.670
 another fundamental key of 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.020
 Asian conversions and in this case 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.840
 the Korean commercials is that you have 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.840
 have to dance music and sexy women 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.980
 a very sticky song so that each 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.900

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.170
 fair 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.220
 in order if you want to see these commercials 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.280
 Koreans you know where to do it here 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.380
 down in the description and if we talk about 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.850
 crazy people come from stupid people is 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.470
 those people who follow the stories of 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.970
 interest you already know the cinnamon challenge 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.040
 shelter then the salt and all that shit 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.229
 just in order to make you suffer 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.060
 same and show that suffering with the 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.800
 others how they felt great at 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.659
 perform this type of challenge I do the 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.759
 broken cinnamon overcome that 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.130
 or something like that we regret the last 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.050
 challenges is really soft and always has 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.540
 to people but there are people who create 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.430
 stupidly stupid challenges and there are 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.620
 stupid people who perform them like him 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.390
 fire responds to this challenge 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.160
 get inflamed book on the body 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.930
 to catch fire and you know something like that 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.930
 nothing can come out but a girlfriend 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.570
 reaching 22 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.570
 but 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.269
 and what is the purpose of this challenge that is 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.269
 a human torch 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.520
 because those two leagues are tired of 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.190
 eat fried chicken that they fried 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.570
 themselves and the personal has never done 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.370
 these kinds of challenges you know the 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.590
 popular at all because so that 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.690
 can you end up suffering yourself and 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.350
 upload this to the internet so everything is 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.350
 see suffering 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.970
 yes true because these videos are a 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.770
 easy way to protect this month 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.590
 because these types of videos that were not 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.210
 visits and subscribers 50 months ago 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.150
 made some kind of challenge and if 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:30.470
 you could create one because it would be good 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.630
 lot in their lives so far 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.020
 we go with something much better the tenderness of 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.020
 the cats 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.160
 I am energetic we give ourselves why not 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.840
 I can approach them but we can not 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.840
 avoid washing your tenderness 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:51.260
 and on the other hand the animals very but 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.260
 very 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.870
 Pressure 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.270
 upside down this can bring the means 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:08.420
 just use them as a weapon of 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:10.580
 destruction is that the good ones of the 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:13.190
 cats is that they are very, very affectionate 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:16.690
 but when trying to look sweet do not have 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:16.690
 the worst moment of life 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.290
 sometimes the fight between 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.730
 which is better a cat a dog and also 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.430
 it is said that they are the worst 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.410
 enemies of the world but rather they are the 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:34.200
 best friends if you do not see this cat 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:34.200
