00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.180
 hello to all guys and well back on 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.710
 android mod 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.599
 today I present to you the Roma rutter 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.910
 considered by many to be the ideal heir 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:25.279
 of the blue mars 2000 and indeed 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.470
 set in a very similar manner 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:29.060
 last year I reviewed the 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.340
 blue but I leave the video in 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.170
 description and overlay so 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.120
 if you want you can go and see i 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.989
 meeting points and differences between 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.210
 these two roms 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.130
 one of the advantages of this is the fact 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.560
 which is updated to the latest firmware 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:45.560
 released by samsung lsv for the 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.720
 1 ms version 3 for version 2 while 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.000
 the blue but 2000 has now stopped the 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.320
 support for our device 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.620
 being based on official firmware 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.230
 samsung mounts version 4.1.2 of 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.330
 android and how you can see lists reg 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.520
 and customized we start from 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:04.220
 settings are the classic ones of 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.110
 galaxy s ii with the rutter section in addition 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.700
 rom version 2 and some additions for 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.259
 regarding the screen and the 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.450
 lock screen 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:13.189
 let's start from the latter in 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.749
 lock screen options in addition to those 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:16.490
 provided by samsung we find the 

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:19.270
 possibility to set the lockscreen 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.270
 AOSP 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.390
 the ripple effect and we could also 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.190
 set the ink color with 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.860
 an application that is provided to us e 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.680
 which I will later show you and three other effects 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.870
 the stop of the s2 is the stock of the 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:37.810
 s4 you saw at the beginning of the video 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.810
 or the light effect and the flame effect 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.930
 as for the screen they are 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.430
 tools have been added for 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.680
 change color to the status bar 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.890
 enable shutdown animation 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.730
 of the display crt the multiple window e 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.980
 read zoom 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:54.350
 but let's get to the fundamental additions 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.750
 in the Roma rat section the download item 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.760
 mods c will link to the application 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.680
 update me through which we can 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.320
 check if there are any 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.440
 updates for the rom and download 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.619
 really many applications mgr 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.810
 the mature kernel etc. 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.879
 as you see for example in removed apps and 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.010
 app stores are all those 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:18.200
 applications that were inside the 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.420
 stock firmware and that the developer has 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.810
 decided not to implement and if there 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.370
 will serve we could unload them 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.770
 now applies to the status bar that how 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.540
 see we will be able to customize 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:32.400
 adding or removing functions 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.870
 and for the same icons as their own 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.189
 in the status bar 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.409
 also as you see we will have a 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:39.719
 very many available the 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:42.209
 both for Roma and for example tea 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:44.849
 mature htc the mature stock samsung that 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.709
 ripe samsung galaxy s 5 both for the 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.750
 single applications then the multi 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.400
 window the calculator the calendar la 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.230
 keyboard etc. 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.030
 we will be able to customize the style and the 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.609
 number of goal tools in the menu a 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.250
 drop the text color of the 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:01.739
 notify the curtain itself by adding 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.840
 for example of the images we could 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.459
 implement tungle del galaxy s 4 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.510
 then those in a drop-down menu a 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:12.480
 part is still fix boot animation 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:14.370
 porting and other applications funds between 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.189
 which you will also find those of android 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.290
 various kernel modes including the movie z the 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:22.500
 food and the pole that will be provided with 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.150
 default some modems and scripts to 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.579
 configuration item you can set 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.620
 the app like kind of rebuilt I will 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:30.970
 I advise you to enter clockworkmod 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.519
 the other items in the section 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.489
 roms are custom gold inc 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:38.500
 effect and android backup through the 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.299
 first we will be sent back to the application 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.640
 advanced s that will allow us to 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:45.400
 choose and reorder the tungas present 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.870
 in the pull-down menu in effect as it already is 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.340
 mentioned before will allow us to 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.470
 choose the ink color 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.690
 in the lock screen in the case in 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:55.819
 which we activated the ripple effect e 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.760
 as you see in this case it is red 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:59.959
 and on android backups you will be sent back 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.030
 to the orange application that I already have also 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.430
 reviewed through which you can 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.960
 just make an android or a 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.640
 complete system backup 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.340
 ok with regards to applications 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.200
 there are so many systems and more than 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.690
 the classic ones we find at the way for 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.340
 block advanced advertising that we 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.250
 will allow as already seen before 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.380
 rearrange the tungle apex as beyond 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.660
 the touch wiz will be just that 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.120
 launcher provided by default a browser 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.130
 pop up the apollo configurator in 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.260
 how much as already said before is the kernel 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.820
 by default and this app will allow us to 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:35.370
 control it 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:38.100
 dropbox and file explorer which is great 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.200
 file manager in color changer that there 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.700
 will allow you to change color 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:45.290
 ink on the screen of 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:47.490
 block is not and orange backup superuser 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.830
 boys that of the galaxy s iii 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.020
 fully functional titanium 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.580
 backup and a flashlight update via 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.190
 through which we can precisely 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:59.130
 download all the fashions and packages e 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:01.560
 finally youtube well then we go to 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.960
 look at the classic camera camera 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.150
 del galaxy s ii with settings i 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.950
 effects and shooting modes that well 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:11.000
 we know and therefore we try to 

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:11.000
 take a picture 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:14.699
 we also try 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:21.310
 and how you see the shutter speed e 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.620
 really good 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.449
 speaking 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:27.090
 try the results you can see how i 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:29.600
 details are therefore used as a camera 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:29.600
 that does not give problems 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:52.380
 regarding management 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.480
 I have energy 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.430
 well as with the 2000 battery 

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:58.500
 milian for I have always come to an end 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.300
 day even with two or three hours the 

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:03.750
 screen on and use rather 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:05.970
 intense with that from 1.650 I made a 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:07.710
 a bit more effort in any case the rom if 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:10.110
 also does good with regards to 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:12.270
 the fluidity is definitely good 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:13.800
 and as stability I have only noticed 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:15.870
 a couple of spontaneous restarts during 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.280
 the whole week then all in all 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:18.840
 not bad 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.240
 counting that offers a customization 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.300
 really vast in my opinion is a great one 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:25.230
 Roma and I advise you to try it 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.420
 perfect nothing else to add 

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:29.400
 so this is all for today 

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:30.950
 if you liked the video, please 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.450
 remember to put a nice like 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:34.980
 share it and make the channel known 

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:36.330

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:46.910
 Hi everyone
