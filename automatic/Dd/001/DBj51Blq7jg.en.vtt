can't<00:02:55.940> think<00:02:56.180> nord<00:02:56.450> enough<00:02:56.750> with<00:02:56.959> that<00:02:57.220> now

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
can't think nord enough with that now

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.290 
can't think nord enough with that now
let's<00:02:59.360> talk<00:02:59.660> about<00:02:59.920> what<00:03:00.920> as<00:03:01.250> a<00:03:01.340> pianist<00:03:02.090> and

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
let's talk about what as a pianist and

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.960 
let's talk about what as a pianist and
probably<00:03:03.140> as<00:03:03.440> other<00:03:03.830> musicians<00:03:04.520> who<00:03:04.700> have<00:03:04.850> the

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
probably as other musicians who have the

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.090 
probably as other musicians who have the
stage<00:03:05.240> two<00:03:05.570> let's<00:03:06.260> talk<00:03:06.470> about<00:03:06.709> some<00:03:06.950> of<00:03:06.980> the

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
stage two let's talk about some of the

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.390 
stage two let's talk about some of the
gripes<00:03:07.430> they<00:03:07.670> have<00:03:08.170> now<00:03:09.170> the<00:03:09.230> major<00:03:09.709> number

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
gripes they have now the major number

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.030 
gripes they have now the major number
one<00:03:10.640> gripe<00:03:11.000> I<00:03:11.209> have<00:03:11.510> is<00:03:11.840> the<00:03:12.320> amount<00:03:12.620> of<00:03:12.770> memory

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
one gripe I have is the amount of memory

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.430 
one gripe I have is the amount of memory
that<00:03:13.400> this<00:03:13.730> comes<00:03:14.030> with<00:03:14.300> so<00:03:14.870> if<00:03:14.989> they<00:03:15.110> come<00:03:15.320> up

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
that this comes with so if they come up

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.530 
that this comes with so if they come up
with<00:03:15.590> a<00:03:15.620> new<00:03:15.830> stage<00:03:16.160> I<00:03:16.489> hope<00:03:16.820> they<00:03:17.060> increase

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
with a new stage I hope they increase

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.520 
with a new stage I hope they increase
the<00:03:17.750> memory<00:03:17.930> size<00:03:18.440> because<00:03:19.100> as<00:03:19.340> it<00:03:19.760> is<00:03:19.970> I<00:03:20.530> have

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
the memory size because as it is I have

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.850 
the memory size because as it is I have
the<00:03:22.040> bozon<00:03:22.640> door<00:03:22.790> for<00:03:23.060> Imperial<00:03:23.810> grand<00:03:24.080> to<00:03:24.410> 90

them by getting rid of one and putting
another<00:03:39.020> end<00:03:39.530> and<00:03:39.830> you<00:03:40.010> need<00:03:40.190> a<00:03:40.220> computer<00:03:40.580> to

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850

another end and you need a computer to
do<00:03:41.000> that<00:03:41.410> but<00:03:42.940> it's<00:03:43.940> not<00:03:44.239> actually<00:03:44.900> a

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
do that but it's not actually a

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.110 
do that but it's not actually a
deal-breaker<00:03:45.230> because<00:03:46.130> I<00:03:46.160> still<00:03:46.670> have<00:03:46.940> the

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
deal-breaker because I still have the

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.150 
deal-breaker because I still have the
best<00:03:47.390> pianos<00:03:47.900> in<00:03:48.049> the<00:03:48.170> world<00:03:48.410> it's<00:03:48.739> just<00:03:49.070> a

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
best pianos in the world it's just a

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.310 
best pianos in the world it's just a
matter<00:03:49.400> of<00:03:49.600> deleting<00:03:50.600> one<00:03:50.810> and<00:03:51.049> adding

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
matter of deleting one and adding

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.390 
matter of deleting one and adding
another<00:03:51.620> as<00:03:52.010> needed<00:03:53.000> but<00:03:53.780> so<00:03:54.140> far<00:03:54.410> since<00:03:55.190> they

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
another as needed but so far since they

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.039 
another as needed but so far since they
added<00:03:55.640> the<00:03:55.730> passio<00:03:56.420> Lee<00:03:56.480> I've<00:03:56.690> been<00:03:56.840> using

00:03:57.039 --> 00:03:57.049 
added the passio Lee I've been using

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:59.530 
added the passio Lee I've been using
that<00:03:57.380> a<00:03:57.410> lot<00:03:57.500> almost<00:03:58.250> exclusively<00:03:59.030> so<00:03:59.360> it's

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
that a lot almost exclusively so it's

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.830 
that a lot almost exclusively so it's
not<00:03:59.780> really<00:04:00.470> a<00:04:00.500> deal-breaker<00:04:01.630> second<00:04:02.630> thing

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
not really a deal-breaker second thing

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.539 
not really a deal-breaker second thing
in<00:04:03.080> a<00:04:03.680> keyboard<00:04:04.310> that's<00:04:04.519> this<00:04:05.360> expensive<00:04:06.549> that

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:07.549 
in a keyboard that's this expensive that

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:10.740 
in a keyboard that's this expensive that
LED<00:04:08.239> screen<00:04:08.690> I<00:04:08.720> mean<00:04:08.900> you<00:04:09.230> take<00:04:09.470> my<00:04:09.680> pinky<00:04:10.190> and

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
LED screen I mean you take my pinky and

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.680 
LED screen I mean you take my pinky and
that's<00:04:11.750> the<00:04:11.989> size<00:04:12.290> of<00:04:12.500> the<00:04:12.620> screen<00:04:13.600> you<00:04:14.600> know

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
that's the size of the screen you know

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:16.870 
that's the size of the screen you know
that<00:04:14.900> I've<00:04:15.290> always<00:04:15.560> had<00:04:16.040> a<00:04:16.100> pet<00:04:16.340> peeve<00:04:16.609> with

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
that I've always had a pet peeve with

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.960 
that I've always had a pet peeve with
that<00:04:17.120> and<00:04:17.419> even<00:04:18.260> worse<00:04:18.500> than<00:04:18.799> that<00:04:18.859> is<00:04:19.250> the<00:04:19.519> way

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
that and even worse than that is the way

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:22.920 
that and even worse than that is the way
you<00:04:20.030> change<00:04:20.720> and<00:04:21.079> choose<00:04:21.380> your<00:04:21.709> samples

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
you change and choose your samples

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.450 
you change and choose your samples
really<00:04:23.930> had<00:04:24.290> a<00:04:24.320> problem<00:04:24.620> with<00:04:24.800> that<00:04:24.950> so<00:04:25.190> unless

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
really had a problem with that so unless

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.310 
really had a problem with that so unless
you<00:04:25.640> have<00:04:25.669> a<00:04:25.850> tablet<00:04:26.450> or<00:04:26.570> a<00:04:26.600> computer<00:04:27.020> hooked

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
you have a tablet or a computer hooked

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.370 
you have a tablet or a computer hooked
up<00:04:27.590> to<00:04:27.740> this<00:04:27.890> it's<00:04:28.310> really<00:04:28.760> not<00:04:29.419> very<00:04:29.479> easy<00:04:30.110> to

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
up to this it's really not very easy to

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.860 
up to this it's really not very easy to
change<00:04:30.650> the<00:04:30.919> samples<00:04:31.370> with<00:04:31.610> this<00:04:31.880> those<00:04:32.600> are

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
change the samples with this those are

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.390 
change the samples with this those are
my<00:04:33.050> three<00:04:33.380> main<00:04:33.800> gripes

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
my three main gripes

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.659 
my three main gripes
is<00:04:34.700> it<00:04:35.450> enough<00:04:35.780> to<00:04:36.140> if<00:04:36.440> they<00:04:37.040> come<00:04:37.280> out<00:04:37.310> with<00:04:37.610> a

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669 
is it enough to if they come out with a

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:41.170 
is it enough to if they come out with a
new<00:04:38.120> stage<00:04:38.690> to<00:04:39.590> go<00:04:40.220> through<00:04:40.460> the<00:04:40.550> hassle<00:04:40.820> of

new stage to go through the hassle of
