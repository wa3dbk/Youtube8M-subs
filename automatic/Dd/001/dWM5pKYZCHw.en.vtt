okay in this video I'm going to teach

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:11.590 
okay in this video I'm going to teach
you<00:00:08.570> how<00:00:08.840> to<00:00:08.870> solve<00:00:09.559> the<00:00:10.459> advanced<00:00:11.150> Knights

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:11.600 
you how to solve the advanced Knights

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:17.260 
you how to solve the advanced Knights
tour<00:00:12.200> challenge<00:00:13.330> in<00:00:14.330> the<00:00:14.660> basic<00:00:15.199> tour<00:00:16.270> you

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:17.270 
tour challenge in the basic tour you

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.720 
tour challenge in the basic tour you
were<00:00:17.420> asked<00:00:17.930> to<00:00:18.289> visit<00:00:18.590> each<00:00:18.980> square<00:00:19.310> of<00:00:19.520> the

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:19.730 
were asked to visit each square of the

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.019 
were asked to visit each square of the
board<00:00:20.029> exactly<00:00:20.990> once<00:00:21.349> and<00:00:21.679> you<00:00:22.580> could<00:00:22.789> start

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029 
board exactly once and you could start

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:24.880 
board exactly once and you could start
on<00:00:23.210> a<00:00:23.240> particular<00:00:23.539> square<00:00:23.929> but<00:00:24.679> you<00:00:24.800> are

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
on a particular square but you are

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.359 
on a particular square but you are
allowed<00:00:25.070> to<00:00:25.130> end<00:00:25.669> anywhere<00:00:26.589> in<00:00:27.589> the<00:00:27.859> advanced

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
allowed to end anywhere in the advanced

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.089 
allowed to end anywhere in the advanced
tour<00:00:28.789> that<00:00:29.329> I'm<00:00:29.449> about<00:00:29.689> to<00:00:29.900> show<00:00:30.169> you<00:00:30.230> your

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
tour that I'm about to show you your

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:32.979 
tour that I'm about to show you your
challenge<00:00:31.550> to<00:00:31.970> start<00:00:32.450> on<00:00:32.599> a<00:00:32.630> particular

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
challenge to start on a particular

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.849 
challenge to start on a particular
square<00:00:33.500> and<00:00:33.770> also<00:00:34.730> end<00:00:35.060> on<00:00:35.390> a<00:00:35.450> specific<00:00:35.960> square

00:00:36.849 --> 00:00:36.859 
square and also end on a specific square

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:40.090 
square and also end on a specific square
so<00:00:37.609> it's<00:00:37.760> rather<00:00:37.940> more<00:00:38.120> difficult<00:00:39.020> but<00:00:39.829> if<00:00:39.980> you

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
so it's rather more difficult but if you

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.650 
so it's rather more difficult but if you
follow<00:00:40.309> the<00:00:40.520> procedure<00:00:40.730> that<00:00:41.210> I'll<00:00:41.390> explain

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
follow the procedure that I'll explain

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.020 
follow the procedure that I'll explain
you'll<00:00:42.440> see<00:00:42.680> that<00:00:42.800> it<00:00:42.949> can<00:00:43.039> be<00:00:43.100> done<00:00:43.340> fairly

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
you'll see that it can be done fairly

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.040 
you'll see that it can be done fairly
easily<00:00:45.519> I'm<00:00:46.519> going<00:00:46.789> to<00:00:46.940> assume<00:00:47.300> that<00:00:47.840> you're

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050

quadrants that I'll show you here of the

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.810 
quadrants that I'll show you here of the
board<00:00:57.949> and<00:00:58.219> that<00:00:58.780> you're<00:00:59.780> also<00:00:59.929> familiar<00:01:00.379> with

the left square system and the right
square<00:01:15.979> system<00:01:16.460> and<00:01:16.869> if<00:01:17.869> you're<00:01:18.020> not<00:01:18.140> familiar

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
square system and if you're not familiar

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.620 
square system and if you're not familiar
with<00:01:18.680> those<00:01:19.159> ideas<00:01:19.400> and<00:01:19.880> you're<00:01:20.329> not<00:01:20.450> familiar

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
with those ideas and you're not familiar

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.440 
with those ideas and you're not familiar
with<00:01:20.899> the<00:01:21.020> basic<00:01:21.350> tour<00:01:21.680> then<00:01:22.579> you<00:01:23.030> should<00:01:23.299> look

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
with the basic tour then you should look

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.480 
with the basic tour then you should look
at<00:01:23.600> my<00:01:23.750> video<00:01:24.079> which<00:01:24.770> explains<00:01:24.920> how<00:01:25.430> to

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
at my video which explains how to

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.469 
at my video which explains how to
complete<00:01:25.759> the<00:01:26.329> basic<00:01:26.540> Knight<00:01:27.079> store<00:01:28.299> now<00:01:29.299> in

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
complete the basic Knight store now in

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.710 
complete the basic Knight store now in
the<00:01:29.689> advanced<00:01:30.470> Knights<00:01:30.920> tour<00:01:31.310> as<00:01:31.549> I<00:01:31.759> say<00:01:32.060> you

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
the advanced Knights tour as I say you

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.679 
the advanced Knights tour as I say you
are<00:01:33.290> challenged<00:01:34.280> to<00:01:34.369> start<00:01:34.790> and<00:01:35.060> end<00:01:35.420> on

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
are challenged to start and end on

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:40.270 
are challenged to start and end on
particular<00:01:36.310> squares<00:01:37.659> so<00:01:38.659> I'll<00:01:38.990> show<00:01:39.200> you<00:01:39.280> how

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
particular squares so I'll show you how

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.600 
particular squares so I'll show you how
that<00:01:40.759> works<00:01:41.299> so<00:01:42.290> I'll<00:01:42.500> choose<00:01:42.710> a<00:01:42.770> random<00:01:43.040> start

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
that works so I'll choose a random start

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.929 
that works so I'll choose a random start
and<00:01:43.820> n<00:01:44.180> square<00:01:45.640> there<00:01:46.640> we<00:01:46.790> are

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
and n square there we are

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:49.690 
and n square there we are
the<00:01:47.299> knight<00:01:47.740> represents<00:01:48.740> the<00:01:49.039> stats<00:01:49.399> where

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
the knight represents the stats where

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.529 
the knight represents the stats where
and<00:01:49.939> the<00:01:50.570> target<00:01:50.990> here<00:01:51.229> represents<00:01:51.920> the<00:01:52.189> end

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:52.539 
and the target here represents the end

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:56.080 
and the target here represents the end
square<00:01:53.539> and<00:01:53.810> we<00:01:54.649> have<00:01:54.829> to<00:01:54.920> find<00:01:55.130> a<00:01:55.250> path<00:01:55.490> from

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
square and we have to find a path from

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.330 
square and we have to find a path from
the<00:01:56.270> start<00:01:56.539> to<00:01:56.689> the<00:01:56.719> finish<00:01:57.130> visiting<00:01:58.130> every

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
the start to the finish visiting every

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.120 
the start to the finish visiting every
square<00:01:58.880> on<00:01:59.090> the<00:01:59.689> board<00:01:59.840> and<00:02:00.710> it<00:02:00.859> sounds

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
square on the board and it sounds

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.200 
square on the board and it sounds
impossible<00:02:01.369> but<00:02:01.670> it's<00:02:02.180> not<00:02:02.299> too<00:02:02.840> tricky<00:02:04.210> now

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
impossible but it's not too tricky now

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.200 
impossible but it's not too tricky now
to<00:02:05.270> solve<00:02:05.570> this<00:02:05.719> advanced<00:02:06.320> Knights<00:02:06.680> tour<00:02:07.219> we

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:08.210 
to solve this advanced Knights tour we

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.350 
to solve this advanced Knights tour we
need<00:02:08.600> to<00:02:08.930> notice<00:02:09.740> which<00:02:10.190> of<00:02:10.399> the<00:02:10.610> systems<00:02:11.210> of

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
need to notice which of the systems of

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.800 
need to notice which of the systems of
moves<00:02:11.630> the<00:02:12.110> start<00:02:12.410> and<00:02:12.680> n<00:02:13.010> squares<00:02:13.489> are<00:02:14.180> in<00:02:14.540> and

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
moves the start and n squares are in and

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.280 
moves the start and n squares are in and
in<00:02:15.560> this<00:02:15.680> particular<00:02:16.040> example<00:02:16.840> the

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
in this particular example the

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.309 
in this particular example the
start<00:02:19.159> and<00:02:19.370> end<00:02:19.489> squares<00:02:19.909> are<00:02:20.209> in<00:02:20.269> fact<00:02:21.019> both

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
start and end squares are in fact both

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.530 
start and end squares are in fact both
in<00:02:21.560> the<00:02:21.709> same<00:02:21.980> system<00:02:22.610> they're<00:02:22.790> both<00:02:22.970> in<00:02:23.239> the

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
in the same system they're both in the

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.369 
in the same system they're both in the
left<00:02:24.260> square<00:02:25.180> system<00:02:26.180> as<00:02:26.360> you<00:02:27.349> can<00:02:27.379> see<00:02:28.280> here

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:29.379 
left square system as you can see here

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:32.500 
left square system as you can see here
which<00:02:30.379> creates<00:02:30.769> a<00:02:31.099> minor<00:02:31.580> problem<00:02:31.879> because

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
which creates a minor problem because

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.630 
which creates a minor problem because
normally<00:02:32.930> we<00:02:33.080> would<00:02:33.260> move<00:02:33.470> through<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:34.129> four

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
normally we would move through the four

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.360 
normally we would move through the four
systems<00:02:35.120> going<00:02:35.420> from<00:02:35.810> a<00:02:36.049> diamond<00:02:36.769> system<00:02:37.010> to<00:02:37.340> a

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
systems going from a diamond system to a

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.309 
systems going from a diamond system to a
square<00:02:37.670> system<00:02:38.150> and<00:02:38.750> then<00:02:38.900> to<00:02:38.930> another

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
square system and then to another

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:40.750 
square system and then to another
diamond<00:02:39.769> system<00:02:39.950> for<00:02:40.280> example

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
diamond system for example

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.000 
diamond system for example
and<00:02:40.930> because<00:02:41.930> we're<00:02:42.080> challenged<00:02:42.530> to<00:02:42.709> start

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
and because we're challenged to start

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.100 
and because we're challenged to start
and<00:02:43.220> end<00:02:43.370> in<00:02:43.580> the<00:02:43.610> same<00:02:43.819> system<00:02:44.329> then<00:02:44.690> we<00:02:44.930> need

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
and end in the same system then we need

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.880 
and end in the same system then we need
to<00:02:45.290> get<00:02:45.440> out<00:02:45.739> of<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:47.690> system<00:02:47.930> that<00:02:48.590> we're<00:02:48.769> in

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
to get out of the system that we're in

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.979 
to get out of the system that we're in
as<00:02:49.250> soon<00:02:49.430> as<00:02:49.549> we<00:02:49.670> can<00:02:49.909> so<00:02:50.239> that<00:02:50.269> we<00:02:50.450> can<00:02:50.720> return

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
as soon as we can so that we can return

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.800 
as soon as we can so that we can return
to<00:02:51.230> it<00:02:51.349> at<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.160> end<00:02:52.310> and<00:02:53.120> I'll<00:02:53.239> show<00:02:53.480> you<00:02:53.510> how

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
to it at the end and I'll show you how

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.430 
to it at the end and I'll show you how
that<00:02:53.870> is<00:02:54.260> done<00:02:55.750> essentially<00:02:56.750> what<00:02:56.989> we<00:02:57.140> need<00:02:57.290> to

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
that is done essentially what we need to

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.650 
that is done essentially what we need to
do<00:02:57.620> is<00:02:57.950> to<00:02:58.940> get<00:02:59.299> the<00:02:59.540> knight<00:02:59.750> out<00:03:00.049> of<00:03:00.670> this<00:03:01.670> left

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
do is to get the knight out of this left

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.319 
do is to get the knight out of this left
square<00:03:03.019> system<00:03:03.260> as<00:03:03.980> soon<00:03:04.340> as<00:03:04.579> we<00:03:04.730> safely<00:03:05.209> can

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:05.329 
square system as soon as we safely can

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:08.920 
square system as soon as we safely can
and<00:03:06.099> what<00:03:07.099> I<00:03:07.129> mean<00:03:07.340> by<00:03:07.519> safely<00:03:08.120> is<00:03:08.329> that<00:03:08.720> the

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
and what I mean by safely is that the

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.979 
and what I mean by safely is that the
remaining<00:03:09.620> squares<00:03:10.190> in<00:03:11.000> the<00:03:11.780> quadrant<00:03:12.370> are

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
remaining squares in the quadrant are

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.650 
remaining squares in the quadrant are
capable<00:03:14.989> of<00:03:15.109> being<00:03:15.290> entered<00:03:15.859> and<00:03:16.299> exited<00:03:17.299> at<00:03:17.629> a

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
capable of being entered and exited at a

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.259 
capable of being entered and exited at a
later<00:03:18.140> time<00:03:18.290> so<00:03:18.769> we<00:03:19.370> need<00:03:19.519> to<00:03:19.640> leave<00:03:19.819> squares

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
later time so we need to leave squares

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.539 
later time so we need to leave squares
in<00:03:20.540> this<00:03:20.750> quadrant<00:03:20.989> so<00:03:21.890> that<00:03:22.099> we<00:03:22.190> can<00:03:22.370> enter

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
in this quadrant so that we can enter

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:25.180 
in this quadrant so that we can enter
the<00:03:22.760> quadrant<00:03:23.180> and<00:03:23.299> exit<00:03:24.079> the<00:03:24.200> quadrant<00:03:24.590> at

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.190 
the quadrant and exit the quadrant at

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.240 
the quadrant and exit the quadrant at
the<00:03:25.400> end<00:03:25.579> and<00:03:25.970> in<00:03:26.959> fact<00:03:27.230> we<00:03:27.410> could<00:03:27.650> do<00:03:28.099> that

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
the end and in fact we could do that

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.009 
the end and in fact we could do that
right<00:03:28.310> now<00:03:28.730> if<00:03:29.060> we<00:03:29.239> were<00:03:29.359> to<00:03:29.389> exit<00:03:29.780> straight

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
right now if we were to exit straight

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:31.809 
right now if we were to exit straight
away<00:03:30.290> because<00:03:30.530> we<00:03:30.829> could<00:03:31.010> enter<00:03:31.250> the<00:03:31.400> quadrant

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
away because we could enter the quadrant

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:35.710 
away because we could enter the quadrant
for<00:03:32.000> example<00:03:32.510> on<00:03:33.519> b4<00:03:34.519> we<00:03:34.940> could<00:03:35.120> go<00:03:35.239> around<00:03:35.510> it

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
for example on b4 we could go around it

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:41.020 
for example on b4 we could go around it
and<00:03:35.840> then<00:03:36.290> we<00:03:36.440> could<00:03:36.590> exit<00:03:36.950> it<00:03:37.099> on<00:03:39.040> e2<00:03:40.040> so<00:03:40.880> it

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
and then we could exit it on e2 so it

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.780 
and then we could exit it on e2 so it
would<00:03:41.150> be<00:03:41.269> safe<00:03:41.540> to<00:03:41.919> get<00:03:42.919> the<00:03:43.099> knight<00:03:43.280> out<00:03:43.519> of

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
would be safe to get the knight out of

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.900 
would be safe to get the knight out of
this<00:03:43.940> particular<00:03:44.120> quadrant<00:03:44.810> right<00:03:45.109> now<00:03:45.380> and

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
this particular quadrant right now and

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.770 
this particular quadrant right now and
into<00:03:47.200> another<00:03:48.200> system<00:03:48.829> which<00:03:49.819> we<00:03:50.000> can<00:03:50.180> do<00:03:50.329> here

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
into another system which we can do here

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:56.650 
into another system which we can do here
we<00:03:51.109> can<00:03:51.319> enter<00:03:51.440> the<00:03:51.859> left<00:03:52.669> diamond<00:03:53.470> system<00:03:55.660> so

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
we can enter the left diamond system so

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.509 
we can enter the left diamond system so
let<00:03:57.109> me<00:03:57.230> show<00:03:57.410> you<00:03:57.500> the<00:03:57.620> left<00:03:57.829> of<00:03:58.010> diamonds

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
let me show you the left of diamonds

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:01.629 
let me show you the left of diamonds
system<00:03:58.910> and<00:03:59.200> then<00:04:00.200> all<00:04:00.470> we<00:04:00.620> need<00:04:00.799> to<00:04:00.980> do<00:04:01.220> now<00:04:01.400> is

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:01.639 
system and then all we need to do now is

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:04.479 
system and then all we need to do now is
to<00:04:01.819> go<00:04:01.940> round<00:04:02.239> the<00:04:02.629> board<00:04:02.840> completing<00:04:03.739> that

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
to go round the board completing that

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:08.789 
to go round the board completing that
particular<00:04:04.930> system<00:04:05.930> in<00:04:06.680> the<00:04:07.069> usual<00:04:08.000> way

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:08.799 
particular system in the usual way

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:12.879 
particular system in the usual way
making<00:04:09.799> sure<00:04:10.099> that<00:04:10.730> we<00:04:11.530> go<00:04:12.530> around<00:04:12.620> the

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:12.889 
making sure that we go around the

00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:14.890 
making sure that we go around the
quadrant<00:04:13.280> so<00:04:13.609> that<00:04:13.819> we<00:04:13.940> can<00:04:14.120> enter<00:04:14.389> each

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
quadrant so that we can enter each

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.720 
quadrant so that we can enter each
quadrant<00:04:15.430> in<00:04:16.430> turn<00:04:16.910> and

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:20.730 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.700 

there<00:04:21.330> we<00:04:21.540> have<00:04:21.870> the<00:04:22.350> left<00:04:22.940> diamond<00:04:23.940> system

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
there we have the left diamond system

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.450 
there we have the left diamond system
completed<00:04:25.710> which<00:04:26.670> now<00:04:26.880> allows<00:04:27.030> us<00:04:27.390> to<00:04:27.600> enter

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
completed which now allows us to enter

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.300 
completed which now allows us to enter
the<00:04:29.460> square<00:04:29.880> system<00:04:30.380> now<00:04:31.380> obviously<00:04:31.980> we<00:04:32.130> need

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
the square system now obviously we need

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.070 
the square system now obviously we need
to<00:04:32.430> enter<00:04:32.670> the<00:04:32.790> right<00:04:32.940> square<00:04:33.540> system<00:04:33.780> which

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
to enter the right square system which

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.360 
to enter the right square system which
we<00:04:34.260> can<00:04:34.440> do<00:04:35.240> here<00:04:36.240> you<00:04:36.780> show<00:04:37.020> you<00:04:37.080> the<00:04:37.440> right

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
we can do here you show you the right

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:39.440 
we can do here you show you the right
square<00:04:38.790> system

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
square system

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.980 
square system
and<00:04:39.740> now<00:04:40.740> we<00:04:41.160> can<00:04:41.400> complete<00:04:41.760> that<00:04:42.450> system

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
and now we can complete that system

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.210 
and now we can complete that system
going<00:04:43.860> round<00:04:44.040> the<00:04:44.280> quadrants<00:04:44.840> in<00:04:45.840> turn<00:04:46.230> in<00:04:46.980> the

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
going round the quadrants in turn in the

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:55.790 
going round the quadrants in turn in the
usual<00:04:47.990> way<00:04:51.440> like<00:04:52.440> this<00:04:52.740> and<00:04:54.050> as<00:04:55.050> I<00:04:55.200> say<00:04:55.440> we<00:04:55.590> need

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
usual way like this and as I say we need

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.400 
usual way like this and as I say we need
to<00:04:55.830> just<00:04:56.160> check<00:04:56.520> that<00:04:56.880> when<00:04:57.060> we<00:04:57.150> do<00:04:57.330> this<00:04:57.600> we

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.410 
to just check that when we do this we

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:04.160 
to just check that when we do this we
don't<00:04:58.560> get<00:04:58.860> ourselves<00:05:00.080> trapped<00:05:02.750> okay<00:05:03.750> so<00:05:03.810> that

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:04.170 
don't get ourselves trapped okay so that

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:09.140 
don't get ourselves trapped okay so that
now<00:05:04.410> leaves<00:05:04.770> us<00:05:05.070> the<00:05:06.950> next<00:05:07.950> diamond<00:05:08.370> system<00:05:08.760> to

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
now leaves us the next diamond system to

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.960 
now leaves us the next diamond system to
enter<00:05:09.300> the<00:05:09.840> right<00:05:10.050> diamond<00:05:10.620> system<00:05:10.860> which<00:05:11.730> we

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
enter the right diamond system which we

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.250 
enter the right diamond system which we
can<00:05:12.180> do<00:05:12.390> here<00:05:13.230> let<00:05:13.800> me<00:05:13.830> show<00:05:13.950> you<00:05:14.190> the<00:05:14.460> white

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
can do here let me show you the white

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.530 
can do here let me show you the white
diamond<00:05:16.260> system<00:05:16.500> and<00:05:16.890> now<00:05:17.790> we<00:05:17.850> just<00:05:18.150> complete

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.540 
diamond system and now we just complete

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:23.150 
diamond system and now we just complete
that<00:05:18.570> as<00:05:18.900> usual<00:05:21.170> like<00:05:22.170> this<00:05:22.530> going<00:05:22.950> from

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 
that as usual like this going from

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.160 
that as usual like this going from
quadrant<00:05:23.670> two<00:05:24.540> quadrant<00:05:25.760> completing<00:05:27.170> that

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:28.170 
quadrant two quadrant completing that

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:32.420 
quadrant two quadrant completing that
system<00:05:29.180> and<00:05:30.180> when<00:05:30.810> we<00:05:30.900> enter<00:05:31.200> this<00:05:31.430> final

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
system and when we enter this final

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.730 
system and when we enter this final
quadrant<00:05:32.910> we<00:05:33.600> need<00:05:33.780> to<00:05:33.930> make<00:05:34.080> sure<00:05:34.110> that<00:05:34.470> we<00:05:34.590> go

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
quadrant we need to make sure that we go

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.310 
quadrant we need to make sure that we go
around<00:05:34.800> it<00:05:35.130> in<00:05:35.250> such<00:05:35.550> a<00:05:35.580> way<00:05:35.730> that<00:05:36.300> we<00:05:37.110> can

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
around it in such a way that we can

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.900 
around it in such a way that we can
enter<00:05:37.680> the<00:05:38.420> final<00:05:39.420> system<00:05:40.070> so<00:05:41.070> if<00:05:41.520> we<00:05:41.730> just

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:41.910 
enter the final system so if we just

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:46.850 
enter the final system so if we just
have<00:05:42.120> a<00:05:42.150> quick<00:05:42.590> look<00:05:43.590> then<00:05:44.460> and<00:05:45.440> we<00:05:46.440> should<00:05:46.710> go

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
have a quick look then and we should go

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:53.390 
have a quick look then and we should go
around<00:05:48.320> anti-clockwise<00:05:49.320> like<00:05:50.010> this<00:05:52.400> which

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:53.400 
around anti-clockwise like this which

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.360 
around anti-clockwise like this which
completes<00:05:54.360> that<00:05:54.600> system<00:05:55.080> and<00:05:55.200> now<00:05:55.680> allows<00:05:56.070> us

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
completes that system and now allows us

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:00.620 
completes that system and now allows us
to<00:05:56.790> enter<00:05:57.480> the<00:05:58.100> final<00:05:59.100> left<00:05:59.940> square<00:06:00.330> system

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.630 
to enter the final left square system

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:02.780 
to enter the final left square system
which<00:06:01.200> is<00:06:01.410> the<00:06:01.620> system<00:06:02.040> that<00:06:02.070> contains<00:06:02.580> the

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:02.790 
which is the system that contains the

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.960 
which is the system that contains the
target<00:06:03.210> square<00:06:04.190> now<00:06:05.190> when<00:06:05.370> we<00:06:05.460> go<00:06:05.580> around<00:06:05.640> this

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:05.970 
target square now when we go around this

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:08.450 
target square now when we go around this
final<00:06:06.660> system<00:06:07.080> we<00:06:07.380> need<00:06:07.560> to<00:06:07.710> plan<00:06:08.070> a<00:06:08.100> route

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
final system we need to plan a route

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.870 
final system we need to plan a route
that<00:06:09.090> will<00:06:09.270> allow<00:06:09.540> us<00:06:09.570> to<00:06:09.960> end<00:06:10.140> on<00:06:10.410> the<00:06:10.880> target

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:11.880 
that will allow us to end on the target

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.990 
that will allow us to end on the target
square<00:06:12.840> so<00:06:13.680> if<00:06:13.950> we<00:06:14.100> see<00:06:14.280> where<00:06:14.460> the<00:06:14.490> target

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 
square so if we see where the target

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.850 
square so if we see where the target
square<00:06:15.300> is<00:06:15.510> there's<00:06:15.900> various<00:06:16.260> ways<00:06:16.320> that<00:06:16.710> we

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 
square is there's various ways that we

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:22.850 
square is there's various ways that we
could<00:06:17.070> get<00:06:17.640> to<00:06:18.480> that<00:06:18.510> and<00:06:20.840> the<00:06:21.840> simplest<00:06:22.350> way<00:06:22.590> I

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:22.860 
could get to that and the simplest way I

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.210 
could get to that and the simplest way I
suggest<00:06:23.520> is<00:06:23.820> to<00:06:24.570> complete<00:06:25.230> the<00:06:25.680> upper<00:06:26.010> left

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:26.220 
suggest is to complete the upper left

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.810 
suggest is to complete the upper left
quadrant<00:06:26.970> to<00:06:27.660> come<00:06:27.870> round<00:06:28.110> here<00:06:28.460> to<00:06:29.460> enter

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:29.820 
quadrant to come round here to enter

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:32.780 
quadrant to come round here to enter
into<00:06:30.110> the<00:06:31.110> lower<00:06:31.650> right<00:06:31.920> quadrant<00:06:32.160> and<00:06:32.700> then

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:32.790 
into the lower right quadrant and then

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:33.680 
into the lower right quadrant and then
to<00:06:32.970> end

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:33.690 
to end

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:36.240 
to end
so<00:06:34.690> that's<00:06:34.930> what<00:06:35.080> I'm<00:06:35.170> going<00:06:35.380> to<00:06:35.440> do<00:06:35.680> so<00:06:36.010> we're

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:36.250 
so that's what I'm going to do so we're

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.030 
so that's what I'm going to do so we're
going<00:06:36.430> to<00:06:36.610> complete<00:06:37.260> the<00:06:38.260> upper<00:06:38.770> left

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:39.040 
going to complete the upper left

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.800 
going to complete the upper left
quadrant<00:06:39.820> and<00:06:40.620> then<00:06:41.620> complete<00:06:42.250> the<00:06:42.810> lower

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:43.810 
quadrant and then complete the lower

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:46.530 
quadrant and then complete the lower
left<00:06:44.410> quadrant<00:06:44.920> and<00:06:45.340> you'll<00:06:45.940> notice<00:06:46.330> what<00:06:46.510> I

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:46.540 
left quadrant and you'll notice what I

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:48.090 
left quadrant and you'll notice what I
said<00:06:46.810> earlier<00:06:47.110> that<00:06:47.170> we<00:06:47.380> need<00:06:47.530> to<00:06:47.680> be<00:06:47.800> able<00:06:47.890> to

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:48.100 
said earlier that we need to be able to

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.010 
said earlier that we need to be able to
make<00:06:48.250> sure<00:06:48.280> that<00:06:48.670> we<00:06:48.760> can<00:06:48.970> enter<00:06:49.270> that

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:50.020 
make sure that we can enter that

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.930 
make sure that we can enter that
quadrant<00:06:50.500> that<00:06:50.710> we<00:06:50.830> originally<00:06:51.010> left<00:06:51.640> and

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:51.940 
quadrant that we originally left and

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.020 
quadrant that we originally left and
that<00:06:52.570> we<00:06:52.690> can<00:06:52.810> also<00:06:52.930> exit<00:06:53.380> it<00:06:53.530> which<00:06:54.100> we<00:06:54.310> can<00:06:54.520> so

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:55.030 
that we can also exit it which we can so

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:59.070 
that we can also exit it which we can so
we<00:06:55.210> enter<00:06:55.510> it<00:06:55.570> here<00:06:55.690> and<00:06:56.400> we<00:06:57.400> exit<00:06:57.820> there<00:06:58.750> and

00:06:59.070 --> 00:06:59.080 
we enter it here and we exit there and

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:03.180 
we enter it here and we exit there and
we<00:07:00.040> complete<00:07:00.520> the<00:07:01.420> lower<00:07:01.720> right<00:07:02.050> quadrant<00:07:02.680> and

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:03.190 
we complete the lower right quadrant and

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:08.520 
we complete the lower right quadrant and
then<00:07:03.970> finally<00:07:04.920> we<00:07:05.920> complete<00:07:06.370> the<00:07:06.910> upper<00:07:07.530> right

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:08.530 
then finally we complete the upper right

00:07:08.530 --> 00:07:11.450 
then finally we complete the upper right
quadrant<00:07:08.800> and<00:07:09.240> hey<00:07:10.240> presto<00:07:10.720> we've<00:07:10.930> completed

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:11.460 
quadrant and hey presto we've completed

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:15.540 
quadrant and hey presto we've completed
the<00:07:12.460> night's<00:07:12.670> tour<00:07:13.770> so<00:07:14.770> that's<00:07:15.010> the<00:07:15.160> basic

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:15.550 
the night's tour so that's the basic

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.120 
the night's tour so that's the basic
idea<00:07:15.670> for<00:07:16.090> how<00:07:16.450> to<00:07:16.510> complete<00:07:16.870> the<00:07:17.440> night<00:07:17.710> tour

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:18.130 
idea for how to complete the night tour

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:20.160 
idea for how to complete the night tour
that<00:07:18.820> if<00:07:18.940> you're<00:07:19.120> in<00:07:19.210> a<00:07:19.300> system<00:07:19.690> that<00:07:19.900> you<00:07:19.990> need

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:20.170 
that if you're in a system that you need

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:22.710 
that if you're in a system that you need
to<00:07:20.350> get<00:07:20.530> out<00:07:20.710> of<00:07:20.740> you<00:07:21.730> need<00:07:21.970> to<00:07:22.150> move<00:07:22.300> safely

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:22.720 
to get out of you need to move safely

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.650 
to get out of you need to move safely
out<00:07:23.200> of<00:07:23.230> it<00:07:23.530> as<00:07:23.680> soon<00:07:23.920> as<00:07:24.010> you<00:07:24.070> can<00:07:24.660> ideally

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:25.660 
out of it as soon as you can ideally

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:29.510 
out of it as soon as you can ideally
when<00:07:26.020> you're<00:07:26.169> in<00:07:26.350> the<00:07:26.560> first<00:07:27.250> quadrant<00:07:27.970> so

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:29.520 
when you're in the first quadrant so

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:34.020 
when you're in the first quadrant so
have<00:07:30.520> fun<00:07:30.820> playing<00:07:31.090> with<00:07:31.419> that
