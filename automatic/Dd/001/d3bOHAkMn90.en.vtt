okay<00:00:07.560> I'm<00:00:07.650> finished<00:00:07.830> with<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.220> photon<00:00:08.840> glider

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:10.220 
okay I'm finished with the photon glider

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.119 
okay I'm finished with the photon glider
that<00:00:11.629> edy<00:00:12.629> at<00:00:13.049> experimental<00:00:13.590> Airlines

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:14.129 
that edy at experimental Airlines

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:16.880 
that edy at experimental Airlines
designed<00:00:14.870> came<00:00:15.870> out<00:00:15.990> really<00:00:16.230> nice<00:00:16.440> I<00:00:16.680> already

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
designed came out really nice I already

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.470 
designed came out really nice I already
had<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.160> wing<00:00:17.340> made<00:00:17.670> from<00:00:18.000> another<00:00:18.240> project

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
had the wing made from another project

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.420 
had the wing made from another project
so<00:00:18.960> it<00:00:19.050> didn't<00:00:19.320> take<00:00:19.350> very<00:00:19.500> long<00:00:20.030> I<00:00:22.430> haven't

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
so it didn't take very long I haven't

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.830 
so it didn't take very long I haven't
seen<00:00:23.580> a<00:00:23.610> build<00:00:23.880> video<00:00:24.210> yet<00:00:24.570> I<00:00:24.600> don't<00:00:24.720> think

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
seen a build video yet I don't think

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.320 
seen a build video yet I don't think
he's<00:00:25.080> posted<00:00:25.500> that<00:00:25.680> but<00:00:25.980> it's<00:00:26.790> fairly

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
he's posted that but it's fairly

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.200 
he's posted that but it's fairly
self-explanatory<00:00:28.490> and<00:00:29.490> I'll<00:00:29.730> just<00:00:29.970> kind<00:00:30.120> of

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
self-explanatory and I'll just kind of

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.460 
self-explanatory and I'll just kind of
go<00:00:30.330> ahead<00:00:30.420> I<00:00:30.600> made<00:00:30.870> some<00:00:31.050> different<00:00:31.350> a<00:00:31.380> little

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
go ahead I made some different a little

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.600 
go ahead I made some different a little
bit<00:00:31.680> of<00:00:32.009> changes<00:00:32.669> from<00:00:33.140> what<00:00:34.140> he<00:00:34.260> did<00:00:34.610> mainly

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
bit of changes from what he did mainly

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.560 
bit of changes from what he did mainly
to<00:00:35.700> make<00:00:35.820> it<00:00:35.940> easier<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.300> put<00:00:36.450> together

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
to make it easier to put together

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.009 
to make it easier to put together
although<00:00:37.530> not<00:00:37.739> quite<00:00:37.859> as<00:00:38.070> cool<00:00:38.280> namely<00:00:39.019> the

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:40.019 
although not quite as cool namely the

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:43.520 
although not quite as cool namely the
servos<00:00:40.820> for<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.940> rear<00:00:42.120> control<00:00:42.539> surfaces<00:00:43.170> he

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
servos for the rear control surfaces he

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.430 
servos for the rear control surfaces he
had<00:00:43.710> his<00:00:43.949> embedded<00:00:44.609> and<00:00:44.909> just<00:00:45.839> the<00:00:45.989> control

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
had his embedded and just the control

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.799 
had his embedded and just the control
arm<00:00:46.649> was<00:00:46.829> sticking<00:00:47.070> out<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.339> didn't<00:00:47.730> do<00:00:47.850> that

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
arm was sticking out I didn't do that

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.200 
arm was sticking out I didn't do that
I<00:00:48.839> think<00:00:49.319> this<00:00:49.440> will<00:00:49.559> work<00:00:49.649> fine<00:00:49.920> not<00:00:50.789> quite<00:00:51.059> as

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
I think this will work fine not quite as

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.180 
I think this will work fine not quite as
aerodynamic<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:52.230> know<00:00:52.440> not<00:00:52.620> quite<00:00:52.829> as<00:00:52.980> cool

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
aerodynamic you know not quite as cool

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:00.229 
aerodynamic you know not quite as cool
looking<00:00:53.699> but<00:00:54.539> I<00:00:57.559> think<00:00:58.559> it'll<00:00:58.679> work<00:00:59.239> the

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
looking but I think it'll work the

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.770 
looking but I think it'll work the
fuselage<00:01:00.780> I've<00:01:01.109> got<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.289> rear<00:01:01.530> hatch<00:01:01.800> here<00:01:02.780> to

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
fuselage I've got a rear hatch here to

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.959 
fuselage I've got a rear hatch here to
get<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.379> wiring<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:05.210> I<00:01:07.220> thought<00:01:08.220> my<00:01:08.430> receiver

00:01:08.959 --> 00:01:08.969 
get to wiring and I thought my receiver

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:11.030 
get to wiring and I thought my receiver
was<00:01:09.210> gonna<00:01:09.299> be<00:01:09.509> this<00:01:09.840> far<00:01:10.110> back<00:01:10.439> but<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.829> ended

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
was gonna be this far back but it ended

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.679 
was gonna be this far back but it ended
up<00:01:11.159> being<00:01:11.219> underneath<00:01:11.969> the<00:01:12.119> wings<00:01:12.329> so<00:01:12.659> I

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
up being underneath the wings so I

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.090 
up being underneath the wings so I
didn't<00:01:12.899> really<00:01:13.049> need<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.229> hatch<00:01:13.530> after<00:01:13.829> all

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
didn't really need that hatch after all

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.789 
didn't really need that hatch after all
but<00:01:14.250> it's<00:01:14.399> there<00:01:14.549> in<00:01:14.640> case<00:01:14.670> I<00:01:14.969> need<00:01:15.149> it<00:01:15.799> I've

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
but it's there in case I need it I've

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.709 
but it's there in case I need it I've
got<00:01:16.979> my<00:01:17.100> allure<00:01:17.340> on<00:01:17.490> servo<00:01:17.909> connections<00:01:18.450> here

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:18.719 
got my allure on servo connections here

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:19.999 
got my allure on servo connections here
they<00:01:18.869> go<00:01:19.020> straight<00:01:19.320> down<00:01:19.469> and<00:01:19.530> come<00:01:19.799> out<00:01:19.890> of

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
they go straight down and come out of

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.679 
they go straight down and come out of
the<00:01:20.070> back<00:01:20.219> of<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.430> wing<00:01:20.610> go<00:01:21.329> down<00:01:21.509> into

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
the back of the wing go down into

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.149 
the back of the wing go down into
fuselage<00:01:23.149> the<00:01:24.149> wing<00:01:24.299> is<00:01:24.420> 60<00:01:24.780> inches<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.890> cord

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
fuselage the wing is 60 inches the cord

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.039 
fuselage the wing is 60 inches the cord
is<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.310> little<00:01:26.729> bit<00:01:26.850> bigger<00:01:27.210> than<00:01:27.659> here's<00:01:27.960> I

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
is a little bit bigger than here's I

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.770 
is a little bit bigger than here's I
think<00:01:28.229> it's<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.409> six<00:01:28.740> inch<00:01:28.979> cord<00:01:29.570> instead<00:01:30.570> of<00:01:30.719> a

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
think it's a six inch cord instead of a

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.859 
think it's a six inch cord instead of a
five<00:01:31.020> inch<00:01:31.350> with<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.189> one<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.359> half<00:01:33.390> inch

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
five inch with a one and a half inch

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.980 
five inch with a one and a half inch
control<00:01:34.590> surface<00:01:35.329> so<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.479> cord<00:01:36.689> is<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.780> little

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
control surface so the cord is a little

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.300 
control surface so the cord is a little
bit<00:01:37.079> bigger<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.590> don't<00:01:37.799> think<00:01:37.979> that'll<00:01:38.189> make

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
bit bigger I don't think that'll make

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.950 
bit bigger I don't think that'll make
much<00:01:38.490> of<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.909> difference<00:01:39.030> still<00:01:39.689> think<00:01:39.840> it'll

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
much of a difference still think it'll

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.209 
much of a difference still think it'll
fly<00:01:40.469> fine

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:41.219 
fly fine

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:48.230 
fly fine
