a lot more to do to get this model out
than<00:01:17.540> just<00:01:17.750> cutting<00:01:18.050> a<00:01:18.140> few<00:01:18.290> tapes<00:01:18.590> and<00:01:18.979> that's

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
than just cutting a few tapes and that's

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:21.190 
than just cutting a few tapes and that's
because<00:01:20.090> it's<00:01:20.240> secured<00:01:20.540> to<00:01:20.660> the<00:01:20.750> base<00:01:20.930> with

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.060 
large and heavy model so it does well
when<00:04:26.340> it<00:04:26.460> appears<00:04:26.790> in<00:04:26.850> the<00:04:27.030> cranes<00:04:27.270> etc<00:04:27.390> mine

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
when it appears in the cranes etc mine

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.500 
when it appears in the cranes etc mine
it<00:04:29.070> rolls<00:04:29.340> along<00:04:29.490> really<00:04:29.880> smoothly<00:04:30.180> with<00:04:30.480> a

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
it rolls along really smoothly with a

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.860 
it rolls along really smoothly with a
nice<00:04:30.690> feel<00:04:30.990> of<00:04:31.140> momentum<00:04:31.650> behind<00:04:31.800> it<00:04:32.690> it<00:04:33.690> also

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
nice feel of momentum behind it it also

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.570 
nice feel of momentum behind it it also
works<00:04:34.260> equally<00:04:34.650> well<00:04:34.680> if<00:04:34.950> the<00:04:35.040> steering<00:04:35.430> is

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
works equally well if the steering is

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.010 
works equally well if the steering is
set<00:04:35.790> and<00:04:36.000> it<00:04:36.090> will<00:04:36.210> trace<00:04:36.420> around<00:04:36.690> a<00:04:36.810> shallow

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
set and it will trace around a shallow

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.950 
set and it will trace around a shallow
curve<00:04:38.030> while<00:04:39.030> we're<00:04:39.180> waiting<00:04:39.510> to<00:04:39.630> look<00:04:39.750> at<00:04:39.870> the

tipping function there are a couple of
smaller<00:04:41.580> things<00:04:41.880> to<00:04:42.030> look<00:04:42.120> at<00:04:42.330> and<00:04:42.570> these

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
smaller things to look at and these

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.840 
smaller things to look at and these
include<00:04:43.830> the<00:04:43.950> mirrors<00:04:44.220> which<00:04:44.400> can<00:04:44.580> be<00:04:44.670> folded

the front can be folded up when the

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.810 
the front can be folded up when the

operator on and off let's have a look
now<00:04:53.340> and<00:04:53.610> see<00:04:53.760> how<00:04:53.910> the<00:04:53.970> tipping<00:04:54.420> action<00:04:54.750> works

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
now and see how the tipping action works

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.530 
now and see how the tipping action works
the<00:04:56.400> first<00:04:56.640> thing<00:04:56.760> to<00:04:56.880> know<00:04:57.000> is<00:04:57.030> that<00:04:57.240> the

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
the first thing to know is that the

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.330 
the first thing to know is that the
hydraulic<00:04:57.840> rams<00:04:58.170> that<00:04:58.410> control<00:04:58.770> it<00:04:58.920> are<00:04:59.070> very

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
hydraulic rams that control it are very

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.220 
hydraulic rams that control it are very
stiff<00:04:59.730> which<00:05:00.240> is<00:05:00.390> a<00:05:00.420> good<00:05:00.660> thing<00:05:00.870> and<00:05:01.050> the

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.230 
stiff which is a good thing and the

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.490 
stiff which is a good thing and the
tipping<00:05:01.530> height<00:05:01.710> is<00:05:01.860> very<00:05:02.100> satisfactory<00:05:02.850> an

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
tipping height is very satisfactory an

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.330 
tipping height is very satisfactory an
interesting<00:05:04.500> thing<00:05:04.620> to<00:05:04.770> know<00:05:04.920> is<00:05:05.100> that<00:05:05.130> the

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
interesting thing to know is that the

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.400 
interesting thing to know is that the
hydraulic<00:05:05.670> rams<00:05:05.970> are<00:05:06.180> in<00:05:06.270> fact<00:05:06.450> two-stage<00:05:07.020> and

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
hydraulic rams are in fact two-stage and

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.490 
hydraulic rams are in fact two-stage and
that<00:05:08.010> partly<00:05:08.340> accounts<00:05:08.730> for<00:05:08.850> their<00:05:09.000> stiffness

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
that partly accounts for their stiffness

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.690 
that partly accounts for their stiffness
there's<00:05:10.500> another<00:05:10.740> interesting<00:05:11.040> feature<00:05:11.430> up

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700 
there's another interesting feature up

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.520 
there's another interesting feature up
on<00:05:11.850> the<00:05:11.940> cab<00:05:12.150> deck<00:05:12.390> and<00:05:12.630> that<00:05:12.840> is<00:05:13.110> that<00:05:13.350> the

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
on the cab deck and that is that the

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.500 
on the cab deck and that is that the
cover<00:05:13.860> opens<00:05:14.430> so<00:05:14.640> that<00:05:14.760> you<00:05:14.820> can<00:05:14.940> see<00:05:15.120> into<00:05:15.390> the

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
cover opens so that you can see into the

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.750 
cover opens so that you can see into the
engine<00:05:15.950> the<00:05:16.950> amount<00:05:17.190> it<00:05:17.310> opens<00:05:17.640> is

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
engine the amount it opens is

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:19.370 
engine the amount it opens is
constrained<00:05:18.240> by<00:05:18.330> one<00:05:18.540> of<00:05:18.630> the<00:05:18.720> handrails<00:05:19.140> but

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
constrained by one of the handrails but

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.140 
constrained by one of the handrails but
it's<00:05:19.500> a<00:05:19.560> nice<00:05:19.740> and<00:05:19.950> stiff<00:05:20.190> mechanism<00:05:20.820> so<00:05:21.030> it

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
it's a nice and stiff mechanism so it

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.030 
it's a nice and stiff mechanism so it
will<00:05:21.240> stay<00:05:21.420> posed<00:05:21.810> in<00:05:22.140> an<00:05:22.260> open<00:05:22.590> position

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.040 
will stay posed in an open position

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.280 
will stay posed in an open position
there's<00:05:24.000> also<00:05:24.150> another<00:05:24.360> small<00:05:24.750> feature<00:05:24.990> which

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:25.290 
there's also another small feature which

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:26.870 
there's also another small feature which
is<00:05:25.440> that<00:05:25.620> the<00:05:25.740> access<00:05:25.860> gate<00:05:26.280> at<00:05:26.460> the<00:05:26.490> top<00:05:26.760> of

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 
is that the access gate at the top of

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.170 
is that the access gate at the top of
the<00:05:26.970> stairs<00:05:27.210> can<00:05:27.480> be<00:05:27.630> opened<00:05:27.930> and<00:05:28.110> closed<00:05:29.180> okay

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
the stairs can be opened and closed okay

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.310 
the stairs can be opened and closed okay
it's<00:05:30.390> time<00:05:30.540> for<00:05:30.600> a<00:05:30.810> genuine<00:05:31.140> imitation

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
it's time for a genuine imitation
