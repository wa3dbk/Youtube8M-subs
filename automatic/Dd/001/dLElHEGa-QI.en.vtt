00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
create another video on how to do this

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.110 
create another video on how to do this
leash<00:00:35.020> and<00:00:35.410> put<00:00:36.160> it<00:00:36.250> together<00:00:36.460> in<00:00:36.910> two

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
leash and put it together in two

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.200 
leash and put it together in two
sections<00:00:37.450> so<00:00:37.990> that<00:00:38.890> there<00:00:39.130> aren't<00:00:39.310> any<00:00:39.579> singe

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
sections so that there aren't any singe

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.240 
sections so that there aren't any singe
marks<00:00:40.449> and<00:00:41.850> it's<00:00:42.850> a<00:00:42.910> little<00:00:43.090> bit<00:00:43.180> cleaner<00:00:44.250> this

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
marks and it's a little bit cleaner this

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.510 
marks and it's a little bit cleaner this
way<00:00:45.309> is<00:00:45.820> very<00:00:46.570> strong<00:00:47.020> there's<00:00:47.500> nothing<00:00:48.370> wrong

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:48.520 
way is very strong there's nothing wrong

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.889 
way is very strong there's nothing wrong
with<00:00:48.730> doing<00:00:48.820> it<00:00:49.000> this<00:00:49.149> way<00:00:49.210> it's<00:00:49.539> just<00:00:49.570> it<00:00:49.809> will

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:49.899 
with doing it this way it's just it will

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:52.229 
with doing it this way it's just it will
have<00:00:50.079> a<00:00:50.109> couple<00:00:50.469> of<00:00:50.530> singe<00:00:50.770> marks<00:00:50.980> so<00:00:51.910> if<00:00:52.149> you

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
have a couple of singe marks so if you

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:54.509 
have a couple of singe marks so if you
don't<00:00:52.420> want<00:00:52.570> the<00:00:52.660> singe<00:00:52.899> marks<00:00:53.219> stay<00:00:54.219> tuned

00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:54.519 
don't want the singe marks stay tuned

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:57.560 
don't want the singe marks stay tuned
for<00:00:54.910> another<00:00:54.969> video<00:00:55.390> on<00:00:55.600> how<00:00:55.780> to<00:00:55.960> do<00:00:56.140> that<00:00:56.340> so

other side and let me tell you why we do

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:10.199 
other side and let me tell you why we do
it<00:02:05.020> that<00:02:05.229> way<00:02:06.719> what<00:02:07.719> we're<00:02:07.929> doing<00:02:09.090> when<00:02:10.090> we

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
it that way what we're doing when we

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.009 
it that way what we're doing when we
start<00:02:10.509> out<00:02:10.660> this<00:02:10.929> way<00:02:11.849> what<00:02:12.849> we're<00:02:13.030> doing<00:02:13.420> is

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:14.019 
start out this way what we're doing is

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:18.300 
start out this way what we're doing is
we're<00:02:14.319> crossing<00:02:14.739> the<00:02:16.290> paracord<00:02:17.310> underneath

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
we're crossing the paracord underneath

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.370 
we're crossing the paracord underneath
of<00:02:18.489> each<00:02:18.610> other<00:02:18.930> so<00:02:19.930> now<00:02:20.230> this<00:02:20.620> cord<00:02:21.160> is

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
of each other so now this cord is

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.699 
of each other so now this cord is
tightening<00:02:23.380> down<00:02:23.430> on<00:02:24.430> this<00:02:24.730> cord<00:02:25.380> okay<00:02:26.380> and

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
tightening down on this cord okay and

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.140 
tightening down on this cord okay and
the<00:02:26.769> same<00:02:27.010> is<00:02:27.190> true<00:02:27.400> on<00:02:27.519> the<00:02:27.760> other<00:02:27.790> side<00:02:30.150> with

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
the same is true on the other side with

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.900 
the same is true on the other side with
paracord<00:02:31.690> we<00:02:31.930> want<00:02:32.170> to<00:02:32.260> try<00:02:32.680> to<00:02:33.519> have<00:02:33.700> it

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
paracord we want to try to have it

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.870 
paracord we want to try to have it
clamped<00:02:34.269> down<00:02:34.510> on<00:02:34.690> to<00:02:35.140> itself<00:02:35.560> so<00:02:35.920> when<00:02:36.760> it

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
clamped down on to itself so when it

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.710 
clamped down on to itself so when it
does<00:02:37.090> that<00:02:37.120> it<00:02:37.540> makes<00:02:37.569> it<00:02:37.900> very<00:02:38.110> tight<00:02:39.299> okay<00:02:40.299> so

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
does that it makes it very tight okay so

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.280 
does that it makes it very tight okay so
now<00:02:40.900> that<00:02:41.049> we<00:02:41.140> have<00:02:42.569> the<00:02:43.569> yellow<00:02:43.780> and<00:02:44.170> its

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
now that we have the yellow and its

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.960 
now that we have the yellow and its
first<00:02:44.500> pass<00:02:44.769> we'll<00:02:45.069> take<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.370> coyote<00:02:45.670> brown

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
first pass we'll take the coyote brown

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.600 
first pass we'll take the coyote brown
and<00:02:46.239> we'll<00:02:46.750> go<00:02:46.900> through<00:02:47.140> one<00:02:47.650> way<00:02:48.629> and<00:02:50.610> then

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:51.610 
and we'll go through one way and then

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:57.289 
and we'll go through one way and then
we'll<00:02:51.940> go<00:02:52.180> through<00:02:52.209> the<00:02:52.569> other<00:02:52.930> way<00:02:54.989> okay<00:02:55.989> now

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:57.299 
we'll go through the other way okay now

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:01.050 
we'll go through the other way okay now
again<00:02:58.299> we're<00:02:58.720> going<00:02:58.810> to<00:02:58.870> go<00:02:59.079> down<00:02:59.319> one<00:02:59.709> and<00:03:00.060> the

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
again we're going to go down one and the

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.780 
again we're going to go down one and the
one<00:03:01.209> we<00:03:01.359> go<00:03:01.510> down<00:03:01.780> is<00:03:02.109> going<00:03:02.530> to<00:03:02.680> be<00:03:02.859> the<00:03:03.549> loop

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
one we go down is going to be the loop

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.309 
one we go down is going to be the loop
for<00:03:04.239> the<00:03:04.329> opposite<00:03:04.810> one<00:03:05.049> okay<00:03:06.690> and<00:03:07.690> again

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
for the opposite one okay and again

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.250 
for the opposite one okay and again
we're<00:03:08.590> going<00:03:08.680> to<00:03:08.739> go<00:03:08.889> counterclockwise<00:03:10.260> watch

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
we're going to go counterclockwise watch

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.490 
we're going to go counterclockwise watch
your<00:03:11.470> twist<00:03:11.880> and<00:03:12.880> you'll<00:03:13.720> see<00:03:13.989> when<00:03:14.170> I<00:03:14.200> pull

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
your twist and you'll see when I pull

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.280 
your twist and you'll see when I pull
this<00:03:14.680> one<00:03:14.920> that<00:03:15.250> that<00:03:15.459> will<00:03:15.670> get<00:03:15.819> tight<00:03:17.639> okay

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
this one that that will get tight okay

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.650 
this one that that will get tight okay
so<00:03:20.290> let's<00:03:20.470> lug<00:03:20.739> that<00:03:20.769> up<00:03:21.160> and<00:03:21.400> then<00:03:22.299> we<00:03:22.420> do<00:03:22.540> the

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
so let's lug that up and then we do the

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.500 
so let's lug that up and then we do the
same<00:03:22.840> thing<00:03:23.139> on<00:03:23.380> the<00:03:23.739> other<00:03:23.769> side

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
same thing on the other side

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:30.300 
same thing on the other side
counterclockwise<00:03:25.590> first<00:03:26.590> loop<00:03:29.099> okay<00:03:30.099> and

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
counterclockwise first loop okay and

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.890 
counterclockwise first loop okay and
then<00:03:30.910> now<00:03:31.060> we'll<00:03:31.239> just<00:03:31.450> tighten<00:03:31.630> everything

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
then now we'll just tighten everything

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.980 
then now we'll just tighten everything
up

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:35.990 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:42.180 

okay<00:03:36.860> so<00:03:37.550> now<00:03:37.670> it<00:03:37.730> looks<00:03:37.970> something<00:03:38.210> like<00:03:38.360> this

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.850 

okay

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
okay

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.060 
okay
and<00:03:45.860> what<00:03:46.010> we<00:03:46.130> want<00:03:46.310> to<00:03:46.370> do<00:03:46.690> is<00:03:47.690> we<00:03:47.870> want<00:03:48.080> to<00:03:48.140> in

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:49.070 
and what we want to do is we want to in

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.110 
and what we want to do is we want to in
this<00:03:49.220> case<00:03:49.400> we're<00:03:49.580> going<00:03:49.670> to<00:03:49.730> start<00:03:49.970> with<00:03:50.060> the

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
this case we're going to start with the

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.020 
this case we're going to start with the
coyote<00:03:50.450> brown<00:03:50.600> we're<00:03:51.290> going<00:03:51.410> to<00:03:51.470> go<00:03:51.620> over<00:03:52.040> to

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
coyote brown we're going to go over to

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.970 
coyote brown we're going to go over to
the<00:03:53.180> first<00:03:53.450> loop<00:03:53.870> so<00:03:54.290> that<00:03:54.530> they're<00:03:54.680> coming

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
the first loop so that they're coming

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.060 
the first loop so that they're coming
out<00:03:55.100> the<00:03:55.280> same<00:03:55.520> loop<00:03:56.560> okay<00:03:57.560> just<00:03:57.920> like<00:03:58.040> that

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:58.070 
out the same loop okay just like that

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.480 
out the same loop okay just like that
and<00:03:59.050> then<00:04:00.050> we're<00:04:00.170> going<00:04:00.290> to<00:04:00.320> rotate<00:04:00.620> back<00:04:01.100> and

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:01.490 
and then we're going to rotate back and

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.440 
and then we're going to rotate back and
you<00:04:02.360> see<00:04:02.510> this<00:04:02.690> one<00:04:02.870> kind<00:04:03.050> of<00:04:03.110> by<00:04:03.260> itself<00:04:04.450> we're

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
you see this one kind of by itself we're

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.020 
you see this one kind of by itself we're
gonna<00:04:05.540> follow<00:04:05.900> it<00:04:06.110> and<00:04:06.470> see<00:04:06.860> that<00:04:07.280> yellow<00:04:07.670> lead

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
gonna follow it and see that yellow lead

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:09.940 
gonna follow it and see that yellow lead
in<00:04:08.330> that<00:04:08.690> first<00:04:08.930> loop<00:04:09.200> so<00:04:09.440> they're<00:04:09.560> coming<00:04:09.830> out

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
in that first loop so they're coming out

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:13.740 
in that first loop so they're coming out
the<00:04:10.100> same<00:04:10.310> loop<00:04:11.170> okay

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
the same loop okay

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:20.710 
the same loop okay
and<00:04:14.750> then<00:04:15.470> we'll<00:04:15.590> tighten<00:04:15.800> it<00:04:15.980> up<00:04:19.270> okay<00:04:20.270> it'll

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
and then we'll tighten it up okay it'll

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.940 
and then we'll tighten it up okay it'll
look<00:04:20.840> something<00:04:21.080> like<00:04:21.410> that<00:04:23.680> and<00:04:24.680> now<00:04:24.800> what

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:24.950 
look something like that and now what

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:28.060 
look something like that and now what
we're<00:04:25.070> going<00:04:25.190> to<00:04:25.220> do<00:04:25.870> is<00:04:26.870> we're<00:04:27.110> gonna<00:04:27.170> go<00:04:27.470> to

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
we're going to do is we're gonna go to

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:31.180 
we're going to do is we're gonna go to
the<00:04:28.220> next<00:04:29.050> the<00:04:30.050> next<00:04:30.380> loop<00:04:30.560> down

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
the next the next loop down

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.070 
the next the next loop down
we're<00:04:31.820> gonna<00:04:31.910> try<00:04:32.150> to<00:04:32.210> keep<00:04:32.390> things<00:04:32.690> in<00:04:32.870> line

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
we're gonna try to keep things in line

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:39.010 
we're gonna try to keep things in line
so<00:04:33.380> that<00:04:33.530> it<00:04:33.620> looks<00:04:33.830> nice<00:04:37.810> remember<00:04:38.810> to<00:04:38.900> always

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
so that it looks nice remember to always

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:45.989 
so that it looks nice remember to always
watch<00:04:39.350> your<00:04:39.590> twist<00:04:39.890> in<00:04:40.100> your<00:04:40.130> cord

00:04:45.989 --> 00:04:45.999 

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:49.439 

so<00:04:46.569> that<00:04:46.719> it<00:04:46.809> looks<00:04:46.959> like<00:04:47.139> that<00:04:47.349> and<00:04:48.449> then

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:49.449 
so that it looks like that and then

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:52.729 
so that it looks like that and then
we'll<00:04:49.599> do<00:04:49.689> the<00:04:49.719> same<00:04:50.019> thing<00:04:50.259> with<00:04:50.409> the<00:04:50.529> yellow

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:52.739 

00:04:52.739 --> 00:05:05.240 

down<00:04:53.739> to<00:04:53.949> the<00:04:54.069> next<00:04:54.339> one

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:11.700 

okay<00:05:06.540> remember<00:05:07.540> to<00:05:07.750> pull<00:05:07.960> tight<00:05:10.470> tank<00:05:11.470> and

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
okay remember to pull tight tank and

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:19.260 
okay remember to pull tight tank and
it's<00:05:11.830> starting<00:05:12.100> to<00:05:12.160> look<00:05:12.310> like<00:05:12.490> this

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.350 

okay<00:05:19.930> and<00:05:20.229> we'll<00:05:20.470> go<00:05:20.590> one<00:05:20.830> more<00:05:21.099> time<00:05:21.370> because

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
okay and we'll go one more time because

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.570 
okay and we'll go one more time because
that'll<00:05:22.750> be<00:05:22.840> our<00:05:22.960> third<00:05:23.229> one<00:05:23.470> we<00:05:23.830> have<00:05:23.949> one<00:05:24.190> and

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
that'll be our third one we have one and

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:31.920 
that'll be our third one we have one and
two<00:05:25.590> you<00:05:26.590> see<00:05:26.740> there's<00:05:26.919> one<00:05:26.979> and<00:05:27.460> two<00:05:29.460> so<00:05:30.780> so<00:05:31.780> we

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
two you see there's one and two so so we

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:37.260 
two you see there's one and two so so we
go<00:05:32.050> down<00:05:32.080> three<00:05:32.560> times<00:05:33.750> and<00:05:35.639> that's<00:05:36.639> normally

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
go down three times and that's normally

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.809 
go down three times and that's normally
enough<00:05:37.539> if<00:05:37.780> you<00:05:38.349> can<00:05:38.560> get<00:05:38.770> paracord<00:05:39.400> to<00:05:39.610> come

00:05:39.809 --> 00:05:39.819 
enough if you can get paracord to come

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:44.510 
enough if you can get paracord to come
across<00:05:40.330> itself<00:05:40.930> three<00:05:41.349> times

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:55.170 

normally<00:05:45.520> it<00:05:45.729> won't<00:05:46.110> come<00:05:47.110> loose<00:05:50.550> okay<00:05:52.979> and<00:05:54.180> we

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
normally it won't come loose okay and we

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.740 
normally it won't come loose okay and we
go<00:05:55.330> one<00:05:55.539> more<00:05:55.599> time<00:05:55.750> here<00:05:57.389> remember<00:05:58.389> to

00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:58.750 
go one more time here remember to

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.020 
go one more time here remember to
continue<00:05:58.960> in<00:05:59.349> your<00:05:59.530> counter<00:05:59.860> clockwise<00:06:00.130> you

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
continue in your counter clockwise you

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.450 
continue in your counter clockwise you
can<00:06:01.210> do<00:06:01.300> it<00:06:01.389> clockwise<00:06:01.630> that<00:06:02.280> really<00:06:03.280> doesn't

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:03.460 
can do it clockwise that really doesn't

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.999 
can do it clockwise that really doesn't
matter<00:06:03.759> I<00:06:04.199> just<00:06:05.199> happened<00:06:05.500> to<00:06:05.530> go<00:06:05.680> that<00:06:05.860> way

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:06.009 
matter I just happened to go that way

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:12.749 
matter I just happened to go that way
and<00:06:07.050> again<00:06:08.050> you<00:06:08.620> can<00:06:08.800> do<00:06:08.949> this<00:06:09.130> another<00:06:09.430> way<00:06:11.759> no

00:06:12.749 --> 00:06:12.759 
and again you can do this another way no

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:14.370 
and again you can do this another way no
way<00:06:12.970> is<00:06:13.030> right<00:06:13.330> or<00:06:13.479> wrong<00:06:13.509> as<00:06:13.900> long<00:06:14.110> as<00:06:14.229> it

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:14.380 
way is right or wrong as long as it

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:17.760 
way is right or wrong as long as it
works<00:06:14.590> that's<00:06:14.889> the<00:06:15.099> key<00:06:15.340> to<00:06:15.370> this<00:06:15.639> so<00:06:16.620> this<00:06:17.620> is

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:17.770 
works that's the key to this so this is

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.460 
works that's the key to this so this is
just<00:06:17.889> one<00:06:18.159> way<00:06:18.190> that<00:06:18.370> I<00:06:18.729> found<00:06:19.150> that<00:06:19.990> makes<00:06:20.259> it

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:20.470 
just one way that I found that makes it

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:23.399 
just one way that I found that makes it
so<00:06:20.620> this<00:06:20.740> is<00:06:20.919> incredibly<00:06:21.520> strong<00:06:21.819> and<00:06:22.409> there's

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:23.409 
so this is incredibly strong and there's

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:25.980 
so this is incredibly strong and there's
no<00:06:23.620> way<00:06:23.830> that<00:06:24.099> this<00:06:24.340> can<00:06:24.729> come<00:06:24.940> loose<00:06:25.180> okay

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:25.990 
no way that this can come loose okay

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:28.860 
no way that this can come loose okay
because<00:06:26.740> as<00:06:27.009> I<00:06:27.190> pull<00:06:27.430> on<00:06:27.460> this<00:06:27.639> these<00:06:28.419> tighten

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:28.870 
because as I pull on this these tighten

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.409 
because as I pull on this these tighten
down<00:06:28.900> on<00:06:29.229> themselves<00:06:29.409> so<00:06:29.949> to<00:06:30.669> finish<00:06:30.940> off<00:06:31.180> the

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:31.419 
down on themselves so to finish off the

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:34.080 
down on themselves so to finish off the
round<00:06:31.599> the<00:06:32.259> four<00:06:32.469> strand<00:06:32.770> round<00:06:33.009> braid<00:06:33.280> we

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.090 
round the four strand round braid we

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:35.790 
round the four strand round braid we
would<00:06:34.240> just<00:06:34.419> cut<00:06:34.630> and<00:06:34.810> singe<00:06:35.139> make<00:06:35.469> sure<00:06:35.650> that

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:35.800 
would just cut and singe make sure that

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.390 
would just cut and singe make sure that
you<00:06:35.949> singe<00:06:36.340> these<00:06:36.820> two<00:06:37.120> leads<00:06:37.449> together<00:06:38.400> so

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:39.400 
you singe these two leads together so

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.279 
you singe these two leads together so
they're<00:06:39.580> not<00:06:39.699> separate<00:06:40.240> so<00:06:40.659> that<00:06:40.870> it's<00:06:40.990> one

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:41.289 
they're not separate so that it's one

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:44.459 
they're not separate so that it's one
piece<00:06:41.849> that<00:06:42.849> way<00:06:43.060> if<00:06:43.270> it<00:06:43.419> tries<00:06:44.110> to<00:06:44.139> pull

00:06:44.459 --> 00:06:44.469 
piece that way if it tries to pull

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:45.719 
piece that way if it tries to pull
through<00:06:44.740> it<00:06:44.860> has<00:06:45.009> to<00:06:45.190> pull<00:06:45.370> everything

00:06:45.719 --> 00:06:45.729 
through it has to pull everything

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:50.430 
through it has to pull everything
through<00:06:45.960> okay<00:06:46.960> and<00:06:47.819> the<00:06:48.819> same<00:06:49.030> on<00:06:49.210> this<00:06:49.360> one<00:06:49.569> so

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:50.440 
through okay and the same on this one so

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:55.080 
through okay and the same on this one so
this<00:06:50.860> is<00:06:50.919> the<00:06:51.099> end<00:06:51.400> of<00:06:52.319> part<00:06:53.319> one<00:06:53.560> of<00:06:53.830> our<00:06:54.819> two
