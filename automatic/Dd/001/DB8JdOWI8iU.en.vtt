especially when we're still in the
winter<00:02:47.330> months<00:02:47.510> just<00:02:47.930> because<00:02:48.320> I<00:02:48.560> think<00:02:48.680> the

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
winter months just because I think the

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.540 
winter months just because I think the
name<00:02:49.370> is<00:02:49.400> so<00:02:49.700> wintery<00:02:50.060> as<00:02:50.240> well<00:02:50.450> and<00:02:51.460> so<00:02:52.460> you
