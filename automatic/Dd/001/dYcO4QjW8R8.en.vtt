00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
for developing on the mac and iOS so

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.790 
for developing on the mac and iOS so
during<00:00:27.090> this<00:00:27.210> conference<00:00:27.680> basically<00:00:28.680> they're

this<00:00:30.720> different<00:00:30.900> stuff<00:00:31.080> for<00:00:31.769> developers<00:00:32.369> so

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
this different stuff for developers so

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.670 
this different stuff for developers so
that<00:00:33.120> they<00:00:33.329> can<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:33.870> know<00:00:33.899> just<00:00:34.230> basically

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
that they can you know just basically

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.410 
that they can you know just basically
develop<00:00:35.190> apps<00:00:35.399> better<00:00:35.820> but<00:00:36.239> there<00:00:36.390> is

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
develop apps better but there is

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.150 
develop apps better but there is
something<00:00:36.780> in<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.230> for<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.559> consumers<00:00:37.980> as

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
something in it for the consumers as

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.270 
something in it for the consumers as
well<00:00:38.809> usually<00:00:39.809> we'll<00:00:39.960> see<00:00:40.260> something<00:00:40.590> new<00:00:41.010> as

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
well usually we'll see something new as

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.450 
well usually we'll see something new as
far<00:00:41.790> as<00:00:41.820> iOS<00:00:42.450> we<00:00:42.600> might<00:00:42.780> see<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.079> preview<00:00:43.440> or<00:00:43.920> at

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
far as iOS we might see a preview or at

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.310 
far as iOS we might see a preview or at
least<00:00:44.670> some<00:00:44.850> sort<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.149> announcement<00:00:45.600> for<00:00:45.930> iOS

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
least some sort of announcement for iOS

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.490 
least some sort of announcement for iOS
6<00:00:46.680> as<00:00:47.579> well<00:00:47.910> as<00:00:48.059> we'll<00:00:48.239> probably<00:00:48.270> see<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:49.140> know

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
6 as well as we'll probably see you know

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.709 
6 as well as we'll probably see you know
the<00:00:49.950> probably<00:00:50.280> demo<00:00:50.489> some<00:00:50.730> features<00:00:51.510> about

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
the probably demo some features about

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.200 
the probably demo some features about
mac<00:00:52.410> OS<00:00:52.770> mountain<00:00:53.340> line<00:00:53.489> which<00:00:53.699> is<00:00:53.730> coming<00:00:54.120> out

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
mac OS mountain line which is coming out

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.470 
mac OS mountain line which is coming out
pretty<00:00:54.420> soon<00:00:54.800> but<00:00:55.800> also<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.520> big<00:00:56.670> deal<00:00:56.940> that

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
pretty soon but also the big deal that

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.990 
pretty soon but also the big deal that
apple<00:00:57.930> will<00:00:58.590> probably<00:00:59.100> release<00:00:59.280> is<00:00:59.609> new

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
apple will probably release is new

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.260 
apple will probably release is new
hardware<00:01:00.660> we<00:01:00.870> haven't<00:01:01.109> seen<00:01:01.320> new<00:01:01.829> macs<00:01:02.309> for<00:01:03.239> a

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
hardware we haven't seen new macs for a

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.200 
hardware we haven't seen new macs for a
while<00:01:03.840> now<00:01:03.870> we<00:01:04.680> also<00:01:04.860> have<00:01:05.309> might<00:01:05.880> see

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
while now we also have might see

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.260 
while now we also have might see
something<00:01:06.479> like<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:07.080> new<00:01:07.380> iphone<00:01:08.130> although<00:01:08.670> I'm

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
something like a new iphone although I'm

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.210 
something like a new iphone although I'm
not<00:01:09.330> predicting<00:01:09.840> that<00:01:10.290> will<00:01:10.500> happen<00:01:10.650> quite

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
not predicting that will happen quite

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.370 
not predicting that will happen quite
yet<00:01:11.610> also<00:01:12.000> Apple<00:01:12.330> hasn't<00:01:12.600> done<00:01:12.780> like<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.080> real

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
yet also Apple hasn't done like a real

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.190 
yet also Apple hasn't done like a real
update<00:01:13.920> for<00:01:14.189> on<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.760> ipod<00:01:15.150> touch<00:01:15.180> in<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.750> while

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
update for on the ipod touch in a while

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.499 
update for on the ipod touch in a while
now<00:01:16.470> almost<00:01:17.009> like<00:01:17.130> two<00:01:17.310> years<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:17.729> think<00:01:17.970> so

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
now almost like two years I think so

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.630 
now almost like two years I think so
we're<00:01:19.470> gonna<00:01:19.590> have<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.920> see<00:01:20.100> if<00:01:20.400> either

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
we're gonna have to see if either

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.100 
we're gonna have to see if either
they're<00:01:20.939> just<00:01:21.119> going<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.299> have<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.479> cancel<00:01:21.780> the

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
they're just going to have to cancel the

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.350 
they're just going to have to cancel the
ipod<00:01:22.439> touch<00:01:22.650> or<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.700> know<00:01:23.820> release<00:01:24.090> fifth

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
ipod touch or you know release fifth

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.510 
ipod touch or you know release fifth
generation<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:25.290> just<00:01:25.530> recently<00:01:25.920> until

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
generation so just recently until

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.100 
generation so just recently until
release<00:01:26.850> their<00:01:27.060> new<00:01:27.090> Ivy<00:01:27.570> Bridge<00:01:27.810> processors

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
release their new Ivy Bridge processors

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.170 
release their new Ivy Bridge processors
which<00:01:28.740> will<00:01:29.329> basically<00:01:31.009> proceed<00:01:32.009> after<00:01:32.369> the

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
which will basically proceed after the

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.850 
which will basically proceed after the
Sandy<00:01:33.540> Bridge<00:01:33.659> processes<00:01:34.409> which<00:01:34.560> are<00:01:34.710> the

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
Sandy Bridge processes which are the

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.429 
Sandy Bridge processes which are the
current<00:01:35.159> ones<00:01:35.340> um<00:01:35.579> which<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.720> pointed<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.200> way

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
current ones um which I pointed that way

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.160 
current ones um which I pointed that way
because<00:01:37.590> I'm<00:01:37.799> running<00:01:38.100> with<00:01:38.250> one<00:01:38.930> nutin<00:01:39.930> race

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
because I'm running with one nutin race

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.039 
because I'm running with one nutin race
but<00:01:40.500> with<00:01:40.650> my<00:01:40.799> computer<00:01:41.070> anyway<00:01:41.790> so<00:01:42.390> um<00:01:42.750> these

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
but with my computer anyway so um these

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.120 
but with my computer anyway so um these
are<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.259> little<00:01:43.350> bit<00:01:43.530> better<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:43.799> little<00:01:43.950> bit

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
are a little bit better a little bit

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.100 
are a little bit better a little bit
faster<00:01:44.250> all<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:44.820> good<00:01:45.000> stuff<00:01:45.030> so<00:01:45.479> we'll

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
faster all that good stuff so we'll

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.990 
faster all that good stuff so we'll
probably<00:01:46.470> see<00:01:46.799> these<00:01:46.979> new<00:01:47.159> processors<00:01:47.820> in

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
probably see these new processors in

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.789 
probably see these new processors in
these<00:01:48.540> new<00:01:48.780> mex<00:01:49.049> it<00:01:49.259> would<00:01:49.350> work<00:01:49.500> out<00:01:49.649> really

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
these new mex it would work out really

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.819 
these new mex it would work out really
well<00:01:49.920> new<00:01:50.430> processors<00:01:51.149> new<00:01:51.840> hardware<00:01:52.290> boom

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
well new processors new hardware boom

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.249 
well new processors new hardware boom
good<00:01:53.640> computer<00:01:53.970> hopefully<00:01:54.689> so<00:01:55.170> we'll
