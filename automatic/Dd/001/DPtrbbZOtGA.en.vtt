alright<00:00:00.930> here<00:00:01.140> we<00:00:01.199> go<00:00:01.290> this<00:00:01.680> is<00:00:01.740> the<00:00:02.159> water<00:00:02.879> and

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
alright here we go this is the water and

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.309 
alright here we go this is the water and
gasoline<00:00:03.510> test<00:00:04.200> we're<00:00:04.470> burning<00:00:05.240> for<00:00:06.240> 21<00:00:06.600> water

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
gasoline test we're burning for 21 water

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:08.960 
gasoline test we're burning for 21 water
to<00:00:07.500> gasoline<00:00:07.950> and<00:00:08.340> I've<00:00:08.550> made<00:00:08.730> a<00:00:08.760> few<00:00:08.910> changes

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
to gasoline and I've made a few changes

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.379 
to gasoline and I've made a few changes
to<00:00:09.480> my<00:00:09.809> deep<00:00:10.320> reactor<00:00:10.800> from<00:00:11.010> test<00:00:11.309> one<00:00:11.400> the

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
to my deep reactor from test one the

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.860 
to my deep reactor from test one the
first<00:00:12.809> big<00:00:13.410> change<00:00:13.830> was<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.490> assembly<00:00:15.299> I've

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
first big change was the assembly I've

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.189 
first big change was the assembly I've
now<00:00:16.170> got<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.470> air<00:00:17.310> mix<00:00:18.180> valve<00:00:18.510> this<00:00:18.779> one<00:00:18.960> here

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
now got the air mix valve this one here

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.759 
now got the air mix valve this one here
up<00:00:19.920> at<00:00:20.160> this<00:00:20.369> end<00:00:20.580> of<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.820> reactor<00:00:21.359> before<00:00:22.170> the

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
up at this end of the reactor before the

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.740 
up at this end of the reactor before the
tea<00:00:22.980> was<00:00:23.160> down<00:00:23.369> here<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:23.850> I<00:00:23.910> was<00:00:24.000> mixing<00:00:24.449> fresh

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
tea was down here and I was mixing fresh

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.450 
tea was down here and I was mixing fresh
air<00:00:24.930> at<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.050> bottom<00:00:25.380> not<00:00:26.039> sure<00:00:26.130> if<00:00:26.189> that<00:00:26.220> makes

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
air at the bottom not sure if that makes

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:27.800 
air at the bottom not sure if that makes
a<00:00:26.580> difference<00:00:26.609> but<00:00:27.060> I've<00:00:27.150> seen<00:00:27.330> it<00:00:27.480> both<00:00:27.599> ways

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
a difference but I've seen it both ways

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.750 
a difference but I've seen it both ways
we'll<00:00:28.050> see<00:00:28.170> if<00:00:28.260> this<00:00:28.410> works<00:00:28.529> better<00:00:28.800> I<00:00:29.070> also

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
we'll see if this works better I also

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.110 
we'll see if this works better I also

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
35 thousandths of an inch so alas I also

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.190 
35 thousandths of an inch so alas I also
added<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.460> little<00:01:05.549> sausage<00:01:06.360> muffler<00:01:06.930> here<00:01:07.170> I

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
added a little sausage muffler here I

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.899 
added a little sausage muffler here I
did<00:01:07.530> not<00:01:07.860> really<00:01:08.100> necessary<00:01:08.549> because<00:01:08.670> it's

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
did not really necessary because it's

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.789 
did not really necessary because it's
pretty<00:01:09.150> quiet<00:01:09.330> what's<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.900> exhaust<00:01:10.590> goes

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
pretty quiet what's the exhaust goes

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.830 
pretty quiet what's the exhaust goes
through<00:01:10.979> all<00:01:11.070> this<00:01:11.189> piping<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.659> last

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
through all this piping and the last

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.590 
through all this piping and the last
chance<00:01:13.200> tank<00:01:13.920> was<00:01:14.640> another<00:01:14.939> big<00:01:15.119> change<00:01:15.360> as

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
chance tank was another big change as

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.050 
chance tank was another big change as
well<00:01:16.040> which<00:01:17.040> I'll<00:01:17.220> show<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.820> little<00:01:17.909> video

bottom<00:01:52.680> here<00:01:53.070> is<00:01:53.189> not<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.399> big<00:01:53.640> shock<00:01:53.939> but<00:01:54.270> the

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
bottom here is not a big shock but the

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.840 
bottom here is not a big shock but the
shade<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.770> yellow<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:56.250> this<00:01:56.399> thing<00:01:56.610> turned

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
shade of yellow that this thing turned

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.969 
shade of yellow that this thing turned
is<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.060> bit<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.450> worry<00:01:58.229> maybe<00:01:58.799> it's<00:01:58.950> just

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
is a bit of a worry maybe it's just

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.100 
is a bit of a worry maybe it's just
because<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.340> engine<00:01:59.640> was<00:01:59.790> dirty<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.180> further

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
because the engine was dirty and further

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.200 
because the engine was dirty and further
testing<00:02:01.619> will<00:02:01.829> prove<00:02:02.790> whether<00:02:03.000> or<00:02:03.119> not

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
testing will prove whether or not

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.310 
testing will prove whether or not
they're<00:02:03.390> going<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.570> continue<00:02:03.840> turning<00:02:04.079> to

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
they're going to continue turning to

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.469 
they're going to continue turning to
fuel<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.649> color<00:02:05.000> as<00:02:06.000> long<00:02:06.149> as<00:02:06.180> I<00:02:06.329> can<00:02:06.390> keep

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
fuel that color as long as I can keep

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.320 
fuel that color as long as I can keep
the<00:02:06.719> gas<00:02:06.869> from<00:02:07.049> splashing<00:02:07.500> up<00:02:07.849> through<00:02:08.849> the

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
the gas from splashing up through the

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.830 
the gas from splashing up through the
fuel<00:02:10.140> line<00:02:10.379> which<00:02:10.679> this<00:02:11.009> nice<00:02:11.849> tall<00:02:12.300> tank<00:02:12.660> is

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
fuel line which this nice tall tank is

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.770 
fuel line which this nice tall tank is
going<00:02:13.050> to<00:02:13.140> do<00:02:13.260> for<00:02:13.500> me

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
going to do for me

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.990 
going to do for me
maybe<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:14.590> gas<00:02:14.740> won't<00:02:14.950> turn<00:02:15.160> color<00:02:15.400> testing

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
maybe the gas won't turn color testing

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.900 
maybe the gas won't turn color testing
today<00:02:16.150> will<00:02:16.270> prove<00:02:16.690> that<00:02:17.550> he<00:02:18.550> goes<00:02:18.760> the

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
today will prove that he goes the

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.960 
today will prove that he goes the
inaugural<00:02:19.390> test<00:02:19.840> of<00:02:20.170> watered-down<00:02:20.980> gasoline

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
inaugural test of watered-down gasoline

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.210 
inaugural test of watered-down gasoline
there's<00:02:22.660> 400<00:02:22.990> mils<00:02:23.380> of<00:02:23.470> water<00:02:23.680> on<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:23.980> left

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
there's 400 mils of water on the left

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.490 
there's 400 mils of water on the left
and<00:02:24.430> 100<00:02:25.000> mils<00:02:25.240> of<00:02:25.360> fresh<00:02:25.630> gas<00:02:25.930> on<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:26.290> right

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
and 100 mils of fresh gas on the right

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.190 
and 100 mils of fresh gas on the right
and<00:02:27.030> my<00:02:28.030> tank<00:02:28.300> which<00:02:29.140> is<00:02:29.170> obviously<00:02:29.680> empty<00:02:31.200> so

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
and my tank which is obviously empty so

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.710 
and my tank which is obviously empty so
here<00:02:32.350> we<00:02:32.410> go<00:02:32.620> I<00:02:35.910> think<00:02:36.910> we're<00:02:37.030> beyond<00:02:37.270> watching

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
here we go I think we're beyond watching

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.979 
here we go I think we're beyond watching
me<00:02:37.870> drink<00:02:38.080> of<00:02:38.380> water<00:02:39.239> but<00:02:40.239> it<00:02:40.330> is<00:02:40.450> water<00:02:40.780> it's

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
me drink of water but it is water it's

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:42.210 
me drink of water but it is water it's
clearly<00:02:41.230> not<00:02:41.350> gas<00:02:41.680> because<00:02:41.950> look<00:02:42.100> at<00:02:42.160> the

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
clearly not gas because look at the

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.990 
clearly not gas because look at the
color<00:02:42.430> difference<00:02:43.890> there<00:02:44.890> we<00:02:44.980> go<00:02:45.130> see<00:02:45.760> if<00:02:45.850> it's

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
color difference there we go see if it's

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.290 
color difference there we go see if it's
work<00:02:46.180> so<00:02:46.500> now<00:02:47.500> we<00:02:47.560> find<00:02:47.860> out<00:02:47.980> whoopsie<00:02:48.970> now<00:02:49.239> we

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
work so now we find out whoopsie now we

00:02:49.300 --> 00:03:02.910 
work so now we find out whoopsie now we
find<00:02:49.600> out<00:02:49.720> if<00:02:49.810> this<00:02:49.900> is<00:02:50.050> an<00:02:50.170> orc<00:03:01.920> getting
