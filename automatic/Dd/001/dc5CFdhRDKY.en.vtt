00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.520 

when<00:00:47.400> you<00:00:47.550> look<00:00:47.790> at<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:47.970> beach<00:00:48.240> at<00:00:48.510> first<00:00:48.810> or<00:00:49.350> you

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
when you look at a beach at first or you

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.350 
when you look at a beach at first or you
can<00:00:49.710> see<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:49.950> sand

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.820 

but<00:00:54.360> when<00:00:54.480> you<00:00:54.600> look<00:00:54.750> more<00:00:54.870> closely<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.680> see

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:55.830 
but when you look more closely you see

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.090 
but when you look more closely you see
stones<00:00:56.370> in<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.760> sand<00:00:57.290> but<00:00:58.290> first<00:00:58.650> all<00:00:59.010> the

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
stones in the sand but first all the

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.970 
stones in the sand but first all the
stones<00:00:59.460> look<00:00:59.610> gray<00:01:00.000> or<00:01:00.239> white<00:01:00.739> again<00:01:01.739> when<00:01:01.890> you

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
stones look gray or white again when you

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.320 
stones look gray or white again when you
look<00:01:02.100> more<00:01:02.220> closely<00:01:02.400> you'll<00:01:02.940> see<00:01:03.000> the

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:03.330 
look more closely you'll see the

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:08.080 
look more closely you'll see the
different<00:01:03.750> colors

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.359 

all<00:01:09.090> on<00:01:09.299> its<00:01:09.450> own<00:01:09.600> tiny<00:01:10.170> little<00:01:10.409> stove<00:01:10.799> but

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
all on its own tiny little stove but

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.310 
all on its own tiny little stove but
then<00:01:11.579> gradually<00:01:12.240> I'm<00:01:12.390> going<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.780> use<00:01:12.929> that<00:01:13.170> as

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
then gradually I'm going to use that as

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.109 
then gradually I'm going to use that as
the<00:01:13.409> middle<00:01:13.710> one<00:01:13.859> and<00:01:14.039> then<00:01:14.369> just<00:01:14.640> work<00:01:14.789> round

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
the middle one and then just work round

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.840 
the middle one and then just work round
in<00:01:15.450> there<00:01:15.600> in<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.960> spiral<00:01:18.079> let's<00:01:19.079> see<00:01:19.850> when

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
in there in a spiral let's see when

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.760 
in there in a spiral let's see when
you're<00:01:20.969> doing<00:01:21.000> something<00:01:21.509> like<00:01:21.719> this<00:01:22.079> spacing

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
you're doing something like this spacing

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.039 
you're doing something like this spacing
between<00:01:23.159> them<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:23.850> almost<00:01:24.119> as<00:01:24.390> important<00:01:24.960> as

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
between them is almost as important as

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:33.590 
between them is almost as important as
the<00:01:25.110> actual<00:01:25.319> mark

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.430 

you<00:01:34.600> know<00:01:34.720> I<00:01:34.750> was<00:01:34.900> just<00:01:35.080> thinking<00:01:35.409> how

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
you know I was just thinking how

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:42.520 
you know I was just thinking how
fantastic<00:01:36.250> it<00:01:36.370> is<00:01:36.460> to<00:01:36.670> be<00:01:36.760> able<00:01:36.820> to<00:01:36.940> do<00:01:37.150> this

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.530 

I<00:01:42.590> can<00:01:43.280> be<00:01:43.369> relaxed<00:01:43.820> because<00:01:43.970> it's<00:01:44.210> summertime

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
I can be relaxed because it's summertime

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.660 
I can be relaxed because it's summertime
it's<00:01:44.990> not<00:01:45.170> going<00:01:45.350> to<00:01:45.409> get<00:01:45.500> dark<00:01:45.770> for<00:01:46.040> ages<00:01:46.430> and

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
it's not going to get dark for ages and

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.940 
it's not going to get dark for ages and
just<00:01:47.299> sitting<00:01:47.690> here<00:01:47.840> quietly<00:01:48.200> working<00:01:48.740> away

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
just sitting here quietly working away

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.950 
just sitting here quietly working away
and<00:01:49.400> just<00:01:49.700> listening<00:01:50.240> to<00:01:50.270> the<00:01:50.450> sound<00:01:50.479> of<00:01:50.869> the

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
and just listening to the sound of the

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.410 
and just listening to the sound of the
sea

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.910 

the<00:01:56.420> rhythm<00:01:56.900> of<00:01:57.020> that<00:01:57.200> it<00:01:57.410> reminds<00:01:57.800> me

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
the rhythm of that it reminds me

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.680 
the rhythm of that it reminds me
actually<00:01:58.040> of<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:58.400> rhythm<00:01:58.700> of<00:01:59.150> these<00:01:59.360> stones

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
actually of the rhythm of these stones

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.750 
actually of the rhythm of these stones
that<00:01:59.930> kind<00:02:00.230> of<00:02:00.260> repetition<00:02:00.650> so<00:02:01.370> I'm<00:02:01.430> working<00:02:01.580> a

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
that kind of repetition so I'm working a

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.390 
that kind of repetition so I'm working a
lot<00:02:01.850> with<00:02:01.910> repetition<00:02:02.690> and<00:02:02.840> the<00:02:03.560> sound<00:02:03.920> of<00:02:04.220> the

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
lot with repetition and the sound of the

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.360 
lot with repetition and the sound of the
water<00:02:04.970> coming<00:02:05.360> in<00:02:05.570> the<00:02:05.780> waves<00:02:06.020> lapping<00:02:06.680> it's

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
water coming in the waves lapping it's

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.280 
water coming in the waves lapping it's
really<00:02:07.670> a<00:02:07.940> real<00:02:08.240> treat<00:02:08.660> to<00:02:08.840> be<00:02:08.869> able<00:02:08.990> to<00:02:09.170> do

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.290 
really a real treat to be able to do

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:10.210

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.270 
it was also thinking as well the colors
are<00:02:13.940> not<00:02:14.540> unlike<00:02:15.020> the<00:02:15.260> sea<00:02:15.500> I<00:02:15.530> mean<00:02:15.830> it's<00:02:15.980> kind

when<00:02:48.740> I'm<00:02:48.860> drawing<00:02:49.160> with<00:02:49.370> stones<00:02:49.790> I<00:02:50.270> look<00:02:50.480> at

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
when I'm drawing with stones I look at

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.900 
when I'm drawing with stones I look at
the<00:02:50.690> structure<00:02:51.080> of<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.470> landscape<00:02:52.040> and<00:02:52.250> think

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
the structure of the landscape and think

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.760 
the structure of the landscape and think
of<00:02:53.030> ways<00:02:53.240> of<00:02:53.510> responding<00:02:53.780> to<00:02:54.170> it<00:02:54.470> I<00:02:56.770> love

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
of ways of responding to it I love

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.160 
of ways of responding to it I love
looking<00:02:58.280> at<00:02:58.400> the<00:02:58.520> pattern<00:02:58.970> and<00:02:59.180> the<00:02:59.510> shape<00:02:59.840> and

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
looking at the pattern and the shape and

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.320 
looking at the pattern and the shape and
color<00:03:00.410> in<00:03:00.740> the<00:03:00.860> rocks<00:03:03.850> taking<00:03:04.850> photographs

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
color in the rocks taking photographs

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.750 
color in the rocks taking photographs
and<00:03:05.930> making<00:03:06.230> sketches<00:03:06.500> helps<00:03:07.190> me<00:03:07.280> to<00:03:07.400> think

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
and making sketches helps me to think

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.870 
and making sketches helps me to think
and<00:03:08.090> develop<00:03:08.540> ideas<00:03:08.690> I<00:03:12.490> take<00:03:13.490> a<00:03:13.520> sketchbook

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:13.880 
and develop ideas I take a sketchbook

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.210 
and develop ideas I take a sketchbook
everywhere<00:03:14.570> sketching<00:03:15.170> helps<00:03:15.650> me<00:03:15.770> to<00:03:15.890> connect

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
everywhere sketching helps me to connect

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:33.880 
everywhere sketching helps me to connect
to<00:03:16.310> the<00:03:16.430> landscape

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.040 

in<00:03:34.890> the<00:03:35.100> summer<00:03:35.370> this<00:03:35.610> quiet<00:03:35.970> code<00:03:36.390> comes<00:03:36.840> to

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
in the summer this quiet code comes to

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.040 
in the summer this quiet code comes to
life<00:03:37.700> people<00:03:38.700> come<00:03:38.910> here<00:03:39.210> to<00:03:39.270> enjoy<00:03:39.780> this

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
life people come here to enjoy this

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.620 
life people come here to enjoy this
natural<00:03:40.500> environment<00:03:40.940> the<00:03:41.940> sea<00:03:42.240> and<00:03:42.510> the

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
natural environment the sea and the

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:51.309 
natural environment the sea and the
stand

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:57.330 

which<00:03:51.500> in<00:03:51.650> the<00:03:51.769> very<00:03:51.980> last<00:03:52.370> stolen<00:03:53.329> now

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.860 

finished<00:03:58.959> well<00:03:59.959> both<00:04:00.409> spirals<00:04:01.390> very<00:04:02.390> similar

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
finished well both spirals very similar

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.869 
finished well both spirals very similar
really<00:04:03.200> except<00:04:03.709> that<00:04:03.829> this<00:04:04.099> piece<00:04:04.370> really

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:04.879 
really except that this piece really

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:07.569 
really except that this piece really
took<00:04:05.120> time<00:04:05.480> over<00:04:05.870> very<00:04:06.079> careful<00:04:06.650> spacing<00:04:07.219> this

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:07.579 
took time over very careful spacing this

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:10.539 
took time over very careful spacing this
much<00:04:07.849> faster<00:04:08.540> more<00:04:09.079> fluid<00:04:09.560> both<00:04:10.010> about<00:04:10.280> color

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
much faster more fluid both about color

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:14.949 
much faster more fluid both about color
and<00:04:11.409> both<00:04:12.409> very<00:04:12.739> simple<00:04:13.340> direct<00:04:13.939> responses<00:04:14.599> to

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
and both very simple direct responses to

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:18.099 
and both very simple direct responses to
this<00:04:15.230> landscape<00:04:16.419> it's<00:04:17.419> getting<00:04:17.720> on<00:04:17.840> now<00:04:18.049> the

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
this landscape it's getting on now the

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.140 
this landscape it's getting on now the
tides<00:04:18.470> coming<00:04:18.799> in<00:04:19.009> and<00:04:19.340> I've<00:04:19.459> not<00:04:19.669> got<00:04:19.850> long<00:04:19.880> I

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
tides coming in and I've not got long I

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.939 
tides coming in and I've not got long I
probably<00:04:20.359> won't<00:04:20.660> see<00:04:20.959> it<00:04:21.079> washed<00:04:21.289> away<00:04:21.500> and

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:21.949 
probably won't see it washed away and

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:23.650 
probably won't see it washed away and
that's<00:04:22.400> the<00:04:22.610> whole<00:04:22.789> thing<00:04:23.060> about<00:04:23.240> something

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
that's the whole thing about something

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.990 
that's the whole thing about something
like<00:04:23.780> this<00:04:23.930> it's<00:04:24.139> very<00:04:24.380> very<00:04:24.620> temporary<00:04:25.190> it's

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
like this it's very very temporary it's

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.150 
like this it's very very temporary it's
gonna<00:04:26.150> be<00:04:26.270> go<00:04:26.449> when<00:04:27.139> the<00:04:27.229> tide<00:04:27.470> comes<00:04:27.710> tonight

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:28.160 
gonna be go when the tide comes tonight

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.010 
gonna be go when the tide comes tonight
and<00:04:28.520> that's<00:04:28.729> it<00:04:28.940> it'll<00:04:29.300> all<00:04:29.389> go<00:04:29.570> back<00:04:29.810> to

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
and that's it it'll all go back to

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.229 
and that's it it'll all go back to
nature
