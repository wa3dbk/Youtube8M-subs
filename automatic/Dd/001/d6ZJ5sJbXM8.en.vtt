00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
because it just a feeling that it

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.400 
because it just a feeling that it
probably<00:00:20.609> just<00:00:20.850> won't<00:00:21.060> happen<00:00:21.240> also<00:00:22.050> a<00:00:22.080> little

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.120 
book ended not I know it's a cliffhanger
and<00:01:06.630> I<00:01:06.720> was<00:01:06.840> very<00:01:06.990> excited<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.470> read<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.799> third

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.679 
and I was very excited to read the third
book<00:01:08.189> but<00:01:08.939> another<00:01:09.210> reason<00:01:09.570> I'm<00:01:09.659> not

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
book but another reason I'm not

book but another reason I'm not
finishing<00:01:10.170> this<00:01:10.470> is<00:01:10.650> because<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.280> had<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.880> wait

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
finishing this is because I had to wait

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.539

almost<00:01:12.510> one<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.650> half<00:01:13.799> years<00:01:14.070> almost<00:01:14.280> two

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
almost one and a half years almost two

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.700 
almost one and a half years almost two
years<00:01:14.850> because<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.869> third<00:01:16.080> book<00:01:16.320> kept<00:01:16.560> on

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
years because the third book kept on

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.530 
years because the third book kept on
changing<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.310> release<00:01:17.580> date<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.090> after

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
changing the release date and after

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.270 
changing the release date and after
about<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.080> year<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.530> half<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.950> me<00:01:20.100> just

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
about a year and a half of me just

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.950 
about a year and a half of me just
waiting<00:01:20.640> for<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.880> book<00:01:21.090> to<00:01:21.119> come<00:01:21.270> out<00:01:21.390> my

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.440 
waiting for a book to come out my
interest<00:01:22.500> tends<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.189> lessen<00:01:23.580> so<00:01:23.939> after<00:01:24.330> the

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
interest tends to lessen so after the

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.969

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.109 
know that I love the first two books but
I<00:01:37.560> honestly<00:01:37.950> forgot<00:01:38.189> what<00:01:38.579> happened<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.060> I

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
I honestly forgot what happened and I

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.370 
I honestly forgot what happened and I
didn't<00:01:39.360> really<00:01:39.540> want<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.750> go<00:01:39.810> back<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.170> reread

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
didn't really want to go back and reread

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.810 
didn't really want to go back and reread
it<00:01:40.560> just<00:01:40.829> because<00:01:41.130> I<00:01:41.310> have<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:41.520> many<00:01:41.610> other

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
it just because I have so many other

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.760 
it just because I have so many other
books<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.270> read<00:01:42.390> so<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:42.990> just<00:01:43.320> probably<00:01:43.560> won't

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
books to read so I just probably won't

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.889 
books to read so I just probably won't
be<00:01:43.860> finishing<00:01:44.159> this<00:01:44.430> series<00:01:44.759> just<00:01:45.270> because<00:01:45.659> of

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
be finishing this series just because of

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.719 
be finishing this series just because of
time<00:01:46.229> restraints<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.009> hype<00:01:47.220> really<00:01:47.549> just

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
time restraints and the hype really just

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.999 
time restraints and the hype really just
lessened<00:01:48.149> for<00:01:48.180> me<00:01:48.479> like<00:01:48.720> big<00:01:49.170> time<00:01:49.470> but<00:01:49.950> I

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
lessened for me like big time but I

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.219 
lessened for me like big time but I
