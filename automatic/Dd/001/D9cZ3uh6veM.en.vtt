of<00:02:44.110> course<00:02:44.620> you<00:02:44.800> want<00:02:44.920> to<00:02:44.980> be<00:02:45.070> have<00:02:45.220> phone

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
of course you want to be have phone

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.820 
of course you want to be have phone
because<00:02:45.820> the<00:02:46.270> laser<00:02:46.420> say<00:02:46.660> just<00:02:46.960> increases

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
because the laser say just increases

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.640 
because the laser say just increases
your<00:02:47.950> hipfire<00:02:48.130> accuracy<00:02:48.580> so<00:02:49.000> you<00:02:49.060> can<00:02:49.300> just

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
your hipfire accuracy so you can just

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.820 
your hipfire accuracy so you can just
really<00:02:50.650> these<00:02:50.770> guys<00:02:50.890> up<00:02:51.250> course<00:02:51.520> and<00:02:52.620> this<00:02:53.620> gun

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
really these guys up course and this gun

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.950 
really these guys up course and this gun
is<00:02:53.860> quite<00:02:54.190> velocity<00:02:54.730> or<00:02:54.880> late<00:02:55.030> there's<00:02:55.810> not

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:55.960 
is quite velocity or late there's not

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.950 
is quite velocity or late there's not
much<00:02:56.080> of<00:02:56.260> a<00:02:56.320> difference<00:02:56.650> between<00:02:56.950> M&amp;N<00:02:57.520> and<00:02:57.960> you

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:58.960 
much of a difference between M&amp;N and you

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.550 
much of a difference between M&amp;N and you
know<00:02:59.250> em<00:03:00.250> using<00:03:01.030> your<00:03:01.060> steady<00:03:01.960> amy<00:03:02.290> or<00:03:02.320> hot

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
know em using your steady amy or hot

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.400 
know em using your steady amy or hot
fire<00:03:02.770> but<00:03:03.600> obviously<00:03:04.600> when<00:03:04.840> you<00:03:04.960> are<00:03:05.020> hot<00:03:05.200> fire

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
fire but obviously when you are hot fire

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.580 
fire but obviously when you are hot fire
and<00:03:05.680> you<00:03:05.710> can<00:03:05.890> move<00:03:06.070> faster<00:03:06.340> and<00:03:07.590> it's

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
and you can move faster and it's

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.260 
and you can move faster and it's
probably<00:03:08.800> more<00:03:09.010> beneficial<00:03:09.580> to<00:03:09.790> have<00:03:10.030> player

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:10.270 
probably more beneficial to have player

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:11.670 
probably more beneficial to have player
with<00:03:10.450> shotguns<00:03:10.750> but<00:03:10.870> I'd<00:03:11.080> see<00:03:11.230> it<00:03:11.290> long<00:03:11.470> range

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
with shotguns but I'd see it long range

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.730 
with shotguns but I'd see it long range
is<00:03:12.040> probably<00:03:12.400> best<00:03:12.580> to<00:03:13.020> you<00:03:14.020> know<00:03:14.140> Amen<00:03:14.560> your

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
is probably best to you know Amen your

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.700 
is probably best to you know Amen your
safes<00:03:15.010> because<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.900> spread<00:03:17.260> of<00:03:17.290> the<00:03:17.560> gun

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:17.710 
safes because the spread of the gun

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.730 
safes because the spread of the gun
shells<00:03:18.070> will<00:03:18.340> be<00:03:18.460> like<00:03:18.760> more<00:03:19.410> that<00:03:20.410> we<00:03:20.500> call

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:20.740
