00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.589 
is what kind of price range are you
looking<00:02:35.349> at<00:02:35.620> ballpark<00:02:36.040> figure<00:02:36.370> here<00:02:36.579> the<00:02:37.450> rack

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
looking at ballpark figure here the rack

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:41.789 
looking at ballpark figure here the rack
hits<00:02:37.840> range<00:02:38.430> from<00:02:39.430> around<00:02:39.720> 700<00:02:40.720> to<00:02:40.750> like<00:02:41.380> the

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
hits range from around 700 to like the

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:43.650 
hits range from around 700 to like the
most<00:02:41.980> expensive<00:02:42.370> ones<00:02:42.489> like<00:02:42.639> 1400<00:02:43.329> but<00:02:43.510> that

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
most expensive ones like 1400 but that

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.360 
most expensive ones like 1400 but that
was<00:02:43.750> where<00:02:43.900> the<00:02:44.049> Jeep<00:02:44.829> that's<00:02:45.130> because

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
was where the Jeep that's because

there's so much that went into the

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.170 
there's so much that went into the
brackets<00:02:47.350> it<00:02:47.620> sure<00:02:47.859> has<00:02:48.220> through<00:02:48.790> the<00:02:49.000> roof

let's take a closer look at that one

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.379 
let's take a closer look at that one
good<00:02:53.410> thing<00:02:53.440> there's<00:02:53.709> beefy<00:02:54.100> too<00:02:54.310> crazy<00:02:55.000> feat

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:57.390 
good thing there's beefy too crazy feat
of<00:02:55.540> engineering<00:02:56.019> to<00:02:56.170> use<00:02:56.350> in<00:02:57.069> factory

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
of engineering to use in factory

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.280 
of engineering to use in factory
locations<00:02:58.239> in<00:02:58.389> the<00:02:58.480> roll<00:02:58.630> bar<00:02:58.840> I<00:02:59.109> like<00:02:59.290> that

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
locations in the roll bar I like that

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.599 
locations in the roll bar I like that
actually<00:03:03.720> spacious<00:03:04.720> with<00:03:04.870> the<00:03:04.959> load<00:03:05.139> said<00:03:05.350> Oh

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 
actually spacious with the load said Oh

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:10.890 
actually spacious with the load said Oh
put<00:03:06.609> pressure<00:03:06.850> on<00:03:07.120> the<00:03:07.450> roof<00:03:07.630> itself<00:03:07.989> got<00:03:08.380> you

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.350 

so<00:03:11.319> by<00:03:11.500> doing<00:03:11.560> that<00:03:11.830> yeah<00:03:12.280> if<00:03:12.940> you<00:03:13.060> take<00:03:13.209> your

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
so by doing that yeah if you take your

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.610 
so by doing that yeah if you take your
roof<00:03:13.540> off<00:03:13.720> you<00:03:13.900> can<00:03:14.019> still<00:03:14.200> put<00:03:14.349> the<00:03:14.440> rack<00:03:14.590> back

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
roof off you can still put the rack back

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.770 
roof off you can still put the rack back
on<00:03:14.950> the<00:03:15.940> rack

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
on the rack

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.809 
on the rack
add<00:03:17.500> a<00:03:17.560> lot<00:03:17.830> of<00:03:17.920> when<00:03:18.099> you<00:03:18.159> want<00:03:18.340> to<00:03:18.430> run<00:03:18.580> top

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
factory locations once again know that

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.259 
factory locations once again know that
there's<00:03:29.319> no<00:03:29.409> modification<00:03:29.980> on<00:03:30.069> the<00:03:30.129> front<00:03:30.400> and

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
there's no modification on the front and

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:32.850 
there's no modification on the front and
since<00:03:31.599> our<00:03:31.750> racks<00:03:31.989> are<00:03:32.200> completely<00:03:32.650> modular

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
since our racks are completely modular

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.140 
since our racks are completely modular
you<00:03:33.190> can<00:03:33.310> build<00:03:33.489> them<00:03:33.579> in<00:03:33.670> any<00:03:33.760> size<00:03:34.000> you<00:03:34.030> want

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
you can build them in any size you want

you can build them in any size you want
you<00:03:35.079> can<00:03:35.200> decide<00:03:35.500> you<00:03:35.799> want<00:03:36.010> an<00:03:36.099> eighth<00:03:36.220> slat

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
you can decide you want an eighth slat

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:38.009 
you can decide you want an eighth slat
rack<00:03:36.760> so<00:03:36.970> you<00:03:37.060> can<00:03:37.180> build<00:03:37.329> eight<00:03:37.510> slats<00:03:37.780> long

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
rack so you can build eight slats long

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:40.559 
rack so you can build eight slats long
you<00:03:38.829> want<00:03:38.980> to<00:03:39.040> go<00:03:39.099> ten<00:03:39.340> later<00:03:39.579> on<00:03:39.760> you<00:03:40.299> can<00:03:40.420> make
