00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.370
 In this video we are going to show you how 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.569
 makes a cherry blossom fondant 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.569
 imitating cloth 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.850
 to make this cherry blossom we are going to 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:28.310
 use our roller a cutter 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.080
 circles if you do not have you can use a 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.599
 mouthpiece of the big part of 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:36.440
 back that they have in the same measure a 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:38.359
 little piece of gum paste and kneaded 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.400
 our cutter that always turns out 

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:43.700
 lie 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:47.230
 so we started a little bit 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:50.690
 sugar we have to leave well finite 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:54.590
 then we put the pink marks of the 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.810
 roll and stretch the area 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:00.250
 the rubber paste in this case I have 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.250
 used until maintained 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.249
 if we go year 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.249
 ah 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.130
 Y 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.880
 Y 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.390
 until it is well stretched by all 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.390
 parts 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.150
 now we cut 6 circles 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.659
 but you see it's the same measure 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.869
 those of the nozzles I'm going to cut three and 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.869
 three 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.869
 is to take a stick 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.920
 expels addition to our 45 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.140
 OK 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.140
 now what we are going to do 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.080
 the fold of each petal this is going to be 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.440
 the petal of each flower then we go 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:14.620
 a little bit of the circle we are going to push 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:17.610
 towards the center towards the center and from the 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:21.500
 two little piquitos that we are staying 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:27.040
 with this already towards inwards we are going to 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:30.460
 join them if you see that that form stays 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.670
 this would be a petal 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:36.390
 I'll do it again 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:39.470
 push is from one side to the center and 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:43.790
 of the other two remaining piquitos 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:46.400
 jce pushes one against another like that 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.450
 if it looks good 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:53.500
 and we will go riding 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:56.890
 we push towards the center and the two 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.920
 piquitos of the laterals thus one against 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:58.920
 other 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.000
 so with the 6 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.310
 towards the center and the two piquitos 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:17.790
 one against the other 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:20.940
 and the last one towards the center and of the 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:24.000
 piquitos that remain there is worth and now 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.360
 simply with a little bit of glue 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.910
 edible 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:32.450
 we are going riding, we are going hitting 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.450
 among them 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:39.840
 trying to crush them while riding the 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:42.740
 flower we give you there the lateral one and we mount 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:46.080
 the next 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:48.830
 a little bit of glue 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.830
 and we ride 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.560
 we carry 4 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.900
 and the last one is going to be the one that closes the 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.170
 flower to give it a little bit here 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.170
 opens 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.750
 and a little bit of glue in both 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:11.750
 sides 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:16.730
 this is going to be the one that closes our 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:21.020
 little flower 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:24.020
 and we already have it stuck with each other and 

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:26.750
 Now what we are going to do is the same 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.760
 color or other that makes contrast 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:32.330
 It depends on the decoration you go to 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:35.630
 use in your cupcake or in your 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:40.910
 cake you make a little granny 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:44.620
 the crushes is a little worth and the 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.620
 we paste to cover the center 

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:53.220
 a little bit and we cover the hole that 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.220
 and look what a beautiful little flower 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:59.860
 I'm going to try to catch the ones that are now 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:04.320
 very tender but for you to see it well 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.320
 there look how pretty it is
