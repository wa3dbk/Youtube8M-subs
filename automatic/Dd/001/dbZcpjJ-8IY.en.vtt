sold the company and none of us knew
about<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.920> so<00:01:14.580> I<00:01:14.610> needed<00:01:14.939> a<00:01:15.030> job<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.630> had

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
about it so I needed a job and I had

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.260 
about it so I needed a job and I had
these<00:01:15.960> presses<00:01:16.350> sitting<00:01:16.680> around<00:01:16.830> so<00:01:17.640> I<00:01:17.909> set<00:01:18.240> up

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
these presses sitting around so I set up

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.039 
these presses sitting around so I set up
my<00:01:18.390> shop<00:01:18.890> piece<00:01:19.890> by<00:01:20.130> piece<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.700> it's<00:01:21.659> set<00:01:22.020> up

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
my shop piece by piece and it's set up

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.620 
my shop piece by piece and it's set up
differently<00:01:22.799> from<00:01:23.240> anything<00:01:24.240> what<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.450> might

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
differently from anything what you might

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.300 
differently from anything what you might
call<00:01:24.840> modern<00:01:25.170> in<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.590> sense<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.040> uses

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
call modern in the sense that it uses

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:39.690 
call modern in the sense that it uses
all<00:01:26.460> letterpress<00:01:26.939> equipment

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.580 

I<00:01:39.759> think<00:01:40.329> the<00:01:40.450> most<00:01:40.630> recent<00:01:40.840> machine<00:01:41.350> we<00:01:41.560> have

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
I think the most recent machine we have

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.490 
I think the most recent machine we have
here<00:01:41.950> is<00:01:42.180> 1972<00:01:43.180> so<00:01:43.780> it's<00:01:43.960> like<00:01:44.079> the<00:01:44.229> state<00:01:44.469> of

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
here is 1972 so it's like the state of

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.590 
here is 1972 so it's like the state of
the<00:01:44.649> art<00:01:44.770> of<00:01:44.890> dead<00:01:45.310> technology<00:01:45.969> is<00:01:46.299> what<00:01:46.479> we're

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:46.600 
the art of dead technology is what we're

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.790 
the art of dead technology is what we're
doing<00:01:46.840> here

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.090 

but<00:01:53.400> they<00:01:53.550> can<00:01:53.790> clanky<00:01:54.420> but<00:01:54.690> you<00:01:55.680> can<00:01:55.860> tell

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
but they can clanky but you can tell

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.020 
but they can clanky but you can tell
that<00:01:56.250> there's<00:01:56.460> something<00:01:57.180> real<00:01:57.600> happening<00:01:58.200> I

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
that there's something real happening I

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.090 
that there's something real happening I
take<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.180> environmental<00:02:00.870> aspect<00:02:01.350> of<00:02:01.620> my

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
take the environmental aspect of my

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.220 
take the environmental aspect of my
trade<00:02:02.550> very<00:02:02.820> seriously<00:02:03.480> I<00:02:03.810> take<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:04.020> very

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:04.230 
trade very seriously I take a very

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.440 
trade very seriously I take a very
practical<00:02:04.530> approach<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.100> it<00:02:05.430> we<00:02:05.580> just<00:02:05.700> use<00:02:06.120> a

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
practical approach to it we just use a

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.070 
practical approach to it we just use a
lot<00:02:06.780> less<00:02:07.430> material<00:02:08.430> I<00:02:08.640> believe<00:02:09.360> very<00:02:09.630> firmly

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
lot less material I believe very firmly

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.500 
lot less material I believe very firmly
in<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.740> old<00:02:10.860> axiom<00:02:11.250> waste<00:02:11.610> not<00:02:11.850> want<00:02:11.910> not

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
in the old axiom waste not want not

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.330 
in the old axiom waste not want not
and<00:02:14.180> the<00:02:15.180> way<00:02:15.330> that<00:02:15.570> poster<00:02:16.140> is<00:02:16.170> printed<00:02:16.680> is<00:02:17.280> a

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
and the way that poster is printed is a

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.400 
and the way that poster is printed is a
good<00:02:17.610> reflection<00:02:17.970> of<00:02:18.150> that<00:02:18.360> it's<00:02:18.990> a<00:02:19.140> slower

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
good reflection of that it's a slower

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.850 
good reflection of that it's a slower
process<00:02:19.710> it<00:02:20.490> wastes<00:02:21.030> less<00:02:21.240> paper<00:02:21.570> it<00:02:22.560> uses

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
process it wastes less paper it uses

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.030 
process it wastes less paper it uses
less<00:02:23.040> ink

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
less ink

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.320 
less ink
we're<00:02:26.040> wasting<00:02:26.430> very<00:02:26.610> little<00:02:26.940> making<00:02:27.210> these

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
we're wasting very little making these

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.970 
we're wasting very little making these
posters<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:28.020> press<00:02:28.290> that's<00:02:28.470> being<00:02:28.740> run<00:02:28.950> on

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
posters the press that's being run on

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.940 
posters the press that's being run on
uses<00:02:29.610> almost<00:02:29.760> no<00:02:30.090> electricity<00:02:30.510> and<00:02:31.320> the<00:02:31.770> rest

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
uses almost no electricity and the rest

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.250 
uses almost no electricity and the rest
of<00:02:32.070> it<00:02:32.160> is<00:02:32.250> muscle<00:02:32.610> power<00:02:32.790> person<00:02:33.510> power

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.870 

there<00:02:37.260> is<00:02:37.440> consumption<00:02:38.040> everything<00:02:38.640> that<00:02:38.790> you

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
there is consumption everything that you

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.880 
there is consumption everything that you
do<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.390> my<00:02:39.660> approach<00:02:39.959> is<00:02:40.140> on<00:02:40.380> in<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:40.680> process

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
do and my approach is on in the process

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.949 
do and my approach is on in the process
of<00:02:41.220> doing<00:02:41.370> that<00:02:41.550> process<00:02:42.150> of<00:02:42.240> consuming<00:02:42.720> try

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
of doing that process of consuming try

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.760 
of doing that process of consuming try
not<00:02:43.140> to<00:02:43.260> lose<00:02:43.500> more<00:02:44.430> than<00:02:44.610> you<00:02:44.730> have<00:02:44.910> to

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
not to lose more than you have to

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.920 
not to lose more than you have to
