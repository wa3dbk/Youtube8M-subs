yes<00:00:38.579> I<00:00:38.790> have<00:00:38.969> many<00:00:39.239> of<00:00:39.420> them<00:00:39.739> sending<00:00:40.739> this

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
yes I have many of them sending this

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.790 
yes I have many of them sending this
package<00:00:41.790> of<00:00:41.969> goodies<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.719> I<00:00:43.200> figured<00:00:43.500> if<00:00:43.680> I

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
package of goodies and I figured if I

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.340 
package of goodies and I figured if I
did<00:00:44.010> not<00:00:44.270> open<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.629> share<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:45.930> with<00:00:46.170> you

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
did not open it and share it with you

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.979 
did not open it and share it with you
now<00:00:46.379> it<00:00:47.160> would<00:00:47.489> probably<00:00:47.520> get<00:00:48.120> lost<00:00:48.300> in<00:00:48.780> all<00:00:48.960> of

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
now it would probably get lost in all of

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.490 
now it would probably get lost in all of
my<00:00:49.440> crafty<00:00:50.340> goodness<00:00:51.120> that<00:00:51.600> has<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:52.020> be<00:00:52.140> moved
