00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.629 

so<00:00:00.840> recall<00:00:01.410> that<00:00:01.469> the<00:00:01.829> earth<00:00:02.010> is<00:00:02.310> not

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
so recall that the earth is not

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:04.039 
so recall that the earth is not
perfectly<00:00:03.300> still

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
perfectly still

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.099 
perfectly still
in<00:00:04.200> fact<00:00:04.770> it<00:00:05.069> rotates<00:00:05.670> with<00:00:06.060> some<00:00:06.330> velocity

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
in fact it rotates with some velocity

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.220 
in fact it rotates with some velocity
about<00:00:07.500> an<00:00:07.830> axis<00:00:08.519> so<00:00:09.210> here<00:00:09.480> we<00:00:09.630> have<00:00:09.840> the<00:00:09.990> earth

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
about an axis so here we have the earth

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.009 
about an axis so here we have the earth
here<00:00:10.260> we<00:00:11.010> have<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:11.519> axis<00:00:12.150> and<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:12.420> earth

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
here we have the axis and the earth

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.849 
here we have the axis and the earth
rotates<00:00:13.920> about<00:00:14.190> this<00:00:14.790> axis<00:00:15.080> now<00:00:16.080> we<00:00:16.440> want<00:00:16.710> to

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
rotates about this axis now we want to

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.650 
rotates about this axis now we want to
ask<00:00:17.070> and<00:00:17.430> answer<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.880> following<00:00:18.150> two

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
ask and answer the following two

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.380 
ask and answer the following two
questions<00:00:18.980> how<00:00:19.980> does<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.490> rotation<00:00:21.150> of<00:00:21.240> the

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
questions how does the rotation of the

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.120 
questions how does the rotation of the
earth<00:00:21.420> affect<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.199> gravitational<00:00:22.949> constant

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
earth affect the gravitational constant

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.359 
earth affect the gravitational constant
G<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:24.029> how<00:00:24.960> does<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.380> rotation<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.250> earth

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
G and how does the rotation of the earth

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.630 
G and how does the rotation of the earth
affect<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.210> weight<00:00:27.480> of<00:00:27.779> an<00:00:27.900> object<00:00:28.279> so<00:00:29.279> let's

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
affect the weight of an object so let's

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.600 
affect the weight of an object so let's
begin<00:00:29.880> by<00:00:30.390> making<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.289> assumption<00:00:31.920> that<00:00:32.099> the

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
begin by making the assumption that the

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.060 
begin by making the assumption that the
earth<00:00:32.759> is<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.120> perfect<00:00:33.809> sphere<00:00:34.040> so<00:00:35.040> that

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
earth is a perfect sphere so that

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.330 
earth is a perfect sphere so that
basically<00:00:35.880> implies<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.260> radius<00:00:37.860> at<00:00:38.160> any

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
basically implies that the radius at any

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.729 
basically implies that the radius at any
given<00:00:38.610> point<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:39.329> exactly<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.140> same<00:00:40.440> it's

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
given point is exactly the same it's

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.910 
given point is exactly the same it's
equal<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.280> six<00:00:42.239> million<00:00:42.629> three<00:00:43.440> hundred<00:00:43.829> and

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
equal to six million three hundred and

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.420 
equal to six million three hundred and
eighty<00:00:44.040> thousand<00:00:44.910> meters<00:00:45.770> so<00:00:46.770> we<00:00:46.950> have<00:00:47.190> no

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
eighty thousand meters so we have no

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.690 
eighty thousand meters so we have no
bulging<00:00:48.120> at<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.690> equators<00:00:49.230> so<00:00:50.100> what<00:00:50.280> suppose

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
bulging at the equators so what suppose

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.510 
bulging at the equators so what suppose
we<00:00:51.030> take<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.360> person<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.170> place<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.770> person<00:00:53.340> at

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
we take a person and place the person at

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.510 
we take a person and place the person at
the<00:00:54.059> pole<00:00:54.360> of<00:00:54.750> our<00:00:55.170> earth<00:00:55.620> so<00:00:55.949> let's<00:00:56.190> say<00:00:56.340> we

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
the pole of our earth so let's say we

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.569 
the pole of our earth so let's say we
place<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.850> person<00:00:57.449> onto<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:57.989> scale<00:00:58.379> at<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:59.219> North

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
place a person onto a scale at the North

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.060 
place a person onto a scale at the North
Pole<00:00:59.699> as<00:01:00.149> shown<00:01:00.510> here<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:01.020> we<00:01:01.320> have<00:01:01.440> the<00:01:01.590> person

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
Pole as shown here so we have the person

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.719 
Pole as shown here so we have the person
the<00:01:02.489> scale<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.629> North<00:01:03.899> Pole<00:01:04.260> so<00:01:05.250> we<00:01:05.460> want

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
the scale and the North Pole so we want

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.000 
the scale and the North Pole so we want
to<00:01:05.909> examine<00:01:06.240> what<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.200> gravitational

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
to examine what the gravitational

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.640 
to examine what the gravitational
constant<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.210> what<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.990> weight<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.530> the

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
constant is and what the weight of the

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.820 
constant is and what the weight of the
object<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.400> so<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.240> object<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:13.080> standing<00:01:13.680> on<00:01:13.710> a

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
object is so the object is standing on a

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.490 
object is so the object is standing on a
scale<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.610> we<00:01:14.880> want<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.270> ask<00:01:15.479> what<00:01:16.259> are<00:01:16.290> the

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
scale and we want to ask what are the

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.490 
scale and we want to ask what are the
forces<00:01:16.830> acting<00:01:17.340> on<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.030> person<00:01:18.570> along<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.290> y

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
forces acting on the person along the y

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.730 
forces acting on the person along the y
axis<00:01:19.530> if<00:01:20.310> we<00:01:20.369> choose<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.540> axis<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.229> be<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.560> Y

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
axis if we choose the axis to be the Y

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.910 
axis if we choose the axis to be the Y
axis<00:01:23.430> so<00:01:23.670> we<00:01:24.180> have<00:01:24.450> two<00:01:24.720> forces<00:01:25.080> acting<00:01:25.680> on<00:01:25.830> the

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
axis so we have two forces acting on the

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.310 
axis so we have two forces acting on the
person<00:01:26.430> we<00:01:26.939> have<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.270> force<00:01:27.540> of<00:01:27.720> gravity

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
person we have the force of gravity

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.289 
person we have the force of gravity
which<00:01:28.560> is<00:01:28.710> acting<00:01:29.130> downward<00:01:29.700> let's<00:01:30.000> choose

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
which is acting downward let's choose

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.050 
which is acting downward let's choose
that<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.600> be<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.020> positive<00:01:31.590> direction<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:32.700> we

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
that to be the positive direction and we

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.330 
that to be the positive direction and we
have<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.390> normal<00:01:33.659> force<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.409> force<00:01:34.979> created

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
have the normal force the force created

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.340 
have the normal force the force created
by<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.850> scale<00:01:36.329> on<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.689> person

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
by the scale on the person

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.170 
by the scale on the person
that's<00:01:37.770> pointing<00:01:38.369> in<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.670> opposite

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
that's pointing in the opposite

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.840 
that's pointing in the opposite
direction<00:01:39.329> of<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.380> force<00:01:40.920> of<00:01:41.130> gravity<00:01:41.640> so

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
direction of the force of gravity so

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.539 
direction of the force of gravity so
it's<00:01:42.030> acting<00:01:42.509> along<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:43.110> negative<00:01:43.920> direction

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
it's acting along the negative direction

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.090 
it's acting along the negative direction
so<00:01:44.579> we<00:01:45.420> have<00:01:45.659> two<00:01:45.899> forces<00:01:46.350> acting<00:01:46.890> on<00:01:46.979> the

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
so we have two forces acting on the

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.429 
so we have two forces acting on the
object<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:48.119> according<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.780> second<00:01:49.290> law<00:01:49.409> of

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
object so according to the second law of

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.090 
object so according to the second law of
motion<00:01:49.759> we<00:01:50.759> have<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.689> net<00:01:51.960> force<00:01:52.409> acting

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
motion we have the net force acting

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.340 
motion we have the net force acting
object<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:53.939> simply<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.479> sum<00:01:54.780> of<00:01:54.810> these<00:01:55.079> two

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
object is simply the sum of these two

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.100 
object is simply the sum of these two
forces<00:01:55.710> so<00:01:56.130> we<00:01:56.159> have<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:57.030> force<00:01:57.299> of<00:01:57.509> gravity

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
forces so we have the force of gravity

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.120 
forces so we have the force of gravity
minus<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:59.219> normal<00:01:59.729> force<00:02:00.000> now<00:02:00.960> notice<00:02:01.590> as<00:02:01.799> the

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
minus the normal force now notice as the

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.539 
minus the normal force now notice as the
Earth<00:02:02.310> rotates<00:02:02.729> it's<00:02:03.719> not<00:02:04.049> actually<00:02:04.619> rotating

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
Earth rotates it's not actually rotating

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.779 
Earth rotates it's not actually rotating
at<00:02:05.700> these<00:02:06.240> two<00:02:06.600> ends<00:02:07.110> at<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.469> poles<00:02:07.770> so<00:02:08.190> that

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
at these two ends at the poles so that

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.250 
at these two ends at the poles so that
means<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.360> person<00:02:10.020> does<00:02:10.500> not

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
means the person does not

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.059 
means the person does not
a<00:02:11.530> centripetal<00:02:12.180> acceleration<00:02:13.180> at<00:02:13.569> the<00:02:13.750> poles

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
a centripetal acceleration at the poles

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.729 
a centripetal acceleration at the poles
so<00:02:15.069> that<00:02:15.099> means<00:02:15.640> this<00:02:15.879> equals<00:02:16.569> M<00:02:16.810> times<00:02:16.870> zero

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
so that means this equals M times zero

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:21.149 
so that means this equals M times zero
because<00:02:18.310> our<00:02:18.459> a<00:02:18.700> zero<00:02:19.209> so<00:02:19.930> this<00:02:20.140> equals<00:02:20.769> zero

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:21.159 
because our a zero so this equals zero

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:24.930 
because our a zero so this equals zero
so<00:02:21.549> we<00:02:22.090> can<00:02:22.120> rearrange<00:02:22.739> this<00:02:23.739> equation<00:02:24.099> and<00:02:24.670> we

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
so we can rearrange this equation and we

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.020 
so we can rearrange this equation and we
find<00:02:25.330> that<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:26.379> gravitational<00:02:27.250> force<00:02:27.610> is

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
find that the gravitational force is

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.250 
find that the gravitational force is
equal<00:02:28.480> to<00:02:28.510> the<00:02:29.319> normal<00:02:29.830> force<00:02:30.129> so<00:02:30.700> mg<00:02:31.330> times<00:02:31.930> or

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
equal to the normal force so mg times or

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.789 
equal to the normal force so mg times or
mg<00:02:32.920> is<00:02:33.129> equal<00:02:33.430> to<00:02:33.700> mg<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:35.140> masses<00:02:35.680> are

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
mg is equal to mg the masses are

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:38.550 
mg is equal to mg the masses are
identical<00:02:36.489> we<00:02:36.700> cancel<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.269> masses<00:02:37.690> out<00:02:37.840> and<00:02:38.079> G

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
identical we cancel the masses out and G

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.970 
identical we cancel the masses out and G
equals<00:02:39.190> G<00:02:39.519> so<00:02:40.090> that<00:02:40.120> means<00:02:40.810> our<00:02:41.290> gravitational

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
equals G so that means our gravitational

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.400 
equals G so that means our gravitational
constant<00:02:42.670> at<00:02:43.450> the<00:02:44.079> poles<00:02:44.410> is<00:02:44.980> simply<00:02:45.959> 9.8<00:02:46.959> 0

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
constant at the poles is simply 9.8 0

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.369 
constant at the poles is simply 9.8 0
meters<00:02:47.829> per<00:02:48.310> second<00:02:48.970> squared<00:02:49.420> and<00:02:49.599> the<00:02:50.079> weight

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:50.379 
meters per second squared and the weight

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:53.369 
meters per second squared and the weight
of<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:50.829> object<00:02:51.519> at<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:51.940> poles<00:02:52.209> is<00:02:52.629> simply<00:02:53.200> M

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379 
of the object at the poles is simply M

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:57.509 
of the object at the poles is simply M
times<00:02:53.950> G<00:02:54.220> our<00:02:55.030> gravitational<00:02:55.629> constant<00:02:56.519> now

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
times G our gravitational constant now

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.119 
times G our gravitational constant now
what<00:02:57.910> about<00:02:58.030> if<00:02:58.510> we<00:02:58.690> take<00:02:58.900> the<00:02:59.109> same<00:02:59.410> person

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:00.129 
what about if we take the same person

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:03.360 
what about if we take the same person
and<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.489> same<00:03:00.760> scale<00:03:01.239> and<00:03:01.480> place<00:03:01.930> it<00:03:02.319> on<00:03:02.470> one

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
and the same scale and place it on one

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.339 
and the same scale and place it on one
of<00:03:03.400> the<00:03:03.640> equator<00:03:04.060> so<00:03:04.239> let's<00:03:04.599> plot<00:03:04.900> let's<00:03:05.170> say

00:03:05.339 --> 00:03:05.349 
of the equator so let's plot let's say

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:08.190 
of the equator so let's plot let's say
we<00:03:05.560> place<00:03:05.859> in<00:03:06.129> here<00:03:06.489> so<00:03:07.060> here's<00:03:07.390> our<00:03:07.599> person

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
we place in here so here's our person

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.589 
we place in here so here's our person
standing<00:03:08.590> on<00:03:08.650> a<00:03:08.709> scale<00:03:09.069> at<00:03:09.250> the<00:03:09.400> equator<00:03:09.700> so

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:10.599 
standing on a scale at the equator so

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.949 
standing on a scale at the equator so
now<00:03:10.840> notice<00:03:11.379> our<00:03:11.859> earth<00:03:12.099> is<00:03:12.400> in<00:03:12.730> fact<00:03:12.959> rotating

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
now notice our earth is in fact rotating

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.650 
now notice our earth is in fact rotating
and<00:03:14.109> because<00:03:14.799> the<00:03:14.950> earth<00:03:15.190> is<00:03:15.459> rotating<00:03:15.730> at<00:03:16.480> the

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
and because the earth is rotating at the

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.830 
and because the earth is rotating at the
equators<00:03:17.230> the<00:03:17.769> person<00:03:18.340> in<00:03:18.459> the<00:03:18.579> scale<00:03:18.910> is<00:03:19.180> also

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
equators the person in the scale is also

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.370 
equators the person in the scale is also
rotating<00:03:20.709> so<00:03:21.400> the<00:03:21.519> velocity<00:03:21.700> at<00:03:22.599> this<00:03:22.900> exact

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
rotating so the velocity at this exact

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.520 
rotating so the velocity at this exact
point<00:03:23.500> points<00:03:24.400> out<00:03:24.880> of<00:03:25.209> the<00:03:25.329> board<00:03:25.690> and<00:03:25.989> the

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
point points out of the board and the

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.520 
point points out of the board and the
object<00:03:27.069> is<00:03:27.220> accelerating<00:03:28.079> readily<00:03:29.079> and<00:03:29.290> that

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
object is accelerating readily and that

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.860 
object is accelerating readily and that
points<00:03:30.130> towards<00:03:30.760> the<00:03:30.790> center<00:03:31.329> of<00:03:31.359> the<00:03:31.690> earth

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
points towards the center of the earth

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.229 
points towards the center of the earth
so<00:03:32.230> now<00:03:32.380> we<00:03:32.590> have<00:03:32.889> the<00:03:33.040> object<00:03:33.280> that<00:03:33.790> is<00:03:34.060> in

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
so now we have the object that is in

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.069 
so now we have the object that is in
fact<00:03:34.530> accelerating<00:03:35.700> so<00:03:36.700> if<00:03:36.970> we<00:03:37.209> take<00:03:37.510> the<00:03:37.750> same

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
fact accelerating so if we take the same

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:40.409 
fact accelerating so if we take the same
sum<00:03:38.530> because<00:03:39.040> at<00:03:39.340> this<00:03:39.519> point<00:03:39.880> we<00:03:40.060> have<00:03:40.299> the

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:40.419 
sum because at this point we have the

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:42.960 
sum because at this point we have the
same<00:03:40.660> exact<00:03:41.139> forces<00:03:41.829> acting<00:03:42.549> on<00:03:42.669> the<00:03:42.760> object

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
same exact forces acting on the object

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.569 
same exact forces acting on the object
but<00:03:43.780> now<00:03:44.049> these<00:03:44.290> forces<00:03:44.650> are<00:03:44.950> acting<00:03:45.099> along

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:45.579 
but now these forces are acting along

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:48.270 
but now these forces are acting along
the<00:03:45.760> x<00:03:45.970> axis<00:03:46.299> so<00:03:46.870> let's<00:03:47.410> choose<00:03:47.650> going<00:03:48.040> this

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
the x axis so let's choose going this

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.610 
the x axis so let's choose going this
way<00:03:48.489> to<00:03:48.549> be<00:03:48.790> positive<00:03:49.389> going<00:03:49.569> backwards<00:03:50.290> to<00:03:50.470> be

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
way to be positive going backwards to be

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.069 
way to be positive going backwards to be
negative<00:03:51.160> so<00:03:51.760> the<00:03:51.880> force<00:03:52.120> of<00:03:52.269> gravity<00:03:52.870> acting

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:53.079 
negative so the force of gravity acting

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:55.379 
negative so the force of gravity acting
in<00:03:53.470> this<00:03:53.620> direction<00:03:53.680> pulling<00:03:54.669> down<00:03:54.879> on<00:03:55.209> the

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:55.389 
in this direction pulling down on the

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:57.720 
in this direction pulling down on the
person<00:03:55.870> and<00:03:56.019> the<00:03:56.530> normal<00:03:57.010> force<00:03:57.040> created<00:03:57.700> by

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
person and the normal force created by

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.089 
person and the normal force created by
the<00:03:57.910> scale<00:03:58.299> on<00:03:58.510> the<00:03:58.629> person<00:03:59.079> acting<00:03:59.769> in<00:03:59.950> the

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
the scale on the person acting in the

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:03.300 
the scale on the person acting in the
opposite<00:04:00.669> direction<00:04:00.819> so<00:04:01.510> now<00:04:02.200> if<00:04:02.560> we<00:04:02.590> sum<00:04:03.129> up

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
opposite direction so now if we sum up

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.599 
opposite direction so now if we sum up
all<00:04:03.459> the<00:04:03.639> forces<00:04:03.959> we<00:04:04.959> see<00:04:05.139> that<00:04:05.290> FG<00:04:05.950> minus<00:04:06.459> the

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609 
all the forces we see that FG minus the

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:10.710 
all the forces we see that FG minus the
normal<00:04:06.970> force<00:04:07.269> is<00:04:07.540> equal<00:04:08.199> to<00:04:08.440> M<00:04:08.650> times<00:04:09.459> a<00:04:09.849> where

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
normal force is equal to M times a where

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.080 
normal force is equal to M times a where
a<00:04:10.989> is<00:04:11.319> our<00:04:11.530> radio<00:04:12.099> orcid<00:04:12.609> trip<00:04:12.849> Atal

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
a is our radio orcid trip Atal

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.720 
a is our radio orcid trip Atal

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
acceleration of the earth as well as of

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.740 
acceleration of the earth as well as of
the<00:04:16.000> person<00:04:16.510> so<00:04:16.720> recall<00:04:17.620> that<00:04:17.680> radio

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750

the person so recall that radio
duration<00:04:19.170> is<00:04:19.500> equal<00:04:19.890> to<00:04:20.100> the<00:04:20.579> velocity

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
duration is equal to the velocity

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.350 
duration is equal to the velocity
squared<00:04:21.630> divided<00:04:21.989> by<00:04:22.140> R<00:04:22.670> so<00:04:23.670> that<00:04:23.700> means<00:04:24.180> we

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
squared divided by R so that means we

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.950 
squared divided by R so that means we
can<00:04:24.540> replace<00:04:24.930> this<00:04:25.740> with<00:04:26.040> MV<00:04:27.030> squared<00:04:27.480> divided

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
can replace this with MV squared divided

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.670 
can replace this with MV squared divided
by<00:04:27.990> R<00:04:28.440> now<00:04:29.340> what<00:04:29.670> exactly<00:04:29.850> is<00:04:30.660> the<00:04:30.870> velocity<00:04:31.230> of

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
by R now what exactly is the velocity of

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.160 
by R now what exactly is the velocity of
our<00:04:32.190> earth<00:04:32.460> what<00:04:32.880> is<00:04:33.030> the<00:04:33.150> velocity<00:04:33.450> of<00:04:33.990> the

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.170 
our earth what is the velocity of the

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.430 
our earth what is the velocity of the
object<00:04:34.200> found<00:04:35.040> at<00:04:35.400> the<00:04:35.940> equator<00:04:36.300> so<00:04:37.110> let's

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
object found at the equator so let's

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.500 
object found at the equator so let's
recall<00:04:37.830> what<00:04:37.890> the<00:04:38.250> frequency<00:04:39.000> of<00:04:39.180> the<00:04:39.300> earth

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
recall what the frequency of the earth

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.800 
recall what the frequency of the earth
is<00:04:39.840> the<00:04:40.080> frequency<00:04:40.800> is<00:04:40.980> one<00:04:41.670> revolution<00:04:42.510> one

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
is the frequency is one revolution one

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.220 
is the frequency is one revolution one
full<00:04:43.200> revolution<00:04:43.410> per<00:04:44.250> day<00:04:44.730> and<00:04:45.120> there<00:04:45.600> are<00:04:45.660> 24

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:46.230 
full revolution per day and there are 24

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.410 
full revolution per day and there are 24
hours<00:04:46.260> in<00:04:46.830> a<00:04:46.920> day<00:04:46.950> so<00:04:47.190> that<00:04:47.640> means<00:04:47.970> the

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
hours in a day so that means the

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.310 
hours in a day so that means the
frequency<00:04:49.140> is<00:04:49.290> one<00:04:49.770> involution<00:04:50.550> per<00:04:51.090> 24<00:04:51.840> hours

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
frequency is one involution per 24 hours

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.180 
frequency is one involution per 24 hours
so<00:04:52.919> let's<00:04:53.130> convert<00:04:53.370> this<00:04:53.700> to<00:04:54.860> seconds<00:04:55.860> and<00:04:56.040> we

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
so let's convert this to seconds and we

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.790 
so let's convert this to seconds and we
simply<00:04:56.400> multiply<00:04:57.180> the<00:04:57.210> bottom<00:04:57.900> by<00:04:58.460> 300<00:04:59.460> or

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
simply multiply the bottom by 300 or

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:07.550 
simply multiply the bottom by 300 or
3600<00:05:01.800> and<00:05:01.919> we<00:05:02.190> get<00:05:02.490> 1<00:05:03.150> over<00:05:05.210> 86,400<00:05:06.210> seconds<00:05:07.050> so

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
3600 and we get 1 over 86,400 seconds so

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.210 
3600 and we get 1 over 86,400 seconds so
this<00:05:07.740> is<00:05:07.890> the<00:05:08.010> frequency<00:05:09.020> now<00:05:10.020> what<00:05:10.680> about<00:05:10.800> the

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:11.220 
this is the frequency now what about the

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:14.360 
this is the frequency now what about the
velocity<00:05:11.450> well<00:05:12.450> the<00:05:12.720> velocity<00:05:12.870> is<00:05:13.710> given<00:05:13.980> by

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
velocity well the velocity is given by

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.180 
velocity well the velocity is given by
taking<00:05:14.910> the<00:05:15.060> circumference<00:05:15.870> of<00:05:16.230> our<00:05:16.530> circle

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
taking the circumference of our circle

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.540 
taking the circumference of our circle
of<00:05:17.370> our<00:05:17.850> earth<00:05:18.120> and<00:05:18.390> multiplying<00:05:19.200> that<00:05:19.710> by<00:05:20.010> our

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
of our earth and multiplying that by our

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.020 
of our earth and multiplying that by our
frequency<00:05:21.480> so<00:05:21.750> 2<00:05:22.320> times<00:05:22.650> pi<00:05:23.010> times<00:05:23.040> R<00:05:23.760> where<00:05:24.000> R

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
frequency so 2 times pi times R where R

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.850 
frequency so 2 times pi times R where R
is<00:05:24.240> the<00:05:24.390> radius<00:05:24.540> of<00:05:25.050> the<00:05:25.200> circle

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
is the radius of the circle

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.270 
is the radius of the circle
so<00:05:26.280> R<00:05:26.610> is<00:05:26.940> simply<00:05:27.450> six<00:05:28.080> million<00:05:28.530> three<00:05:29.190> hundred

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 
so R is simply six million three hundred

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.180 
so R is simply six million three hundred
eighty<00:05:29.820> thousand<00:05:30.510> meters<00:05:30.900> so<00:05:31.530> we<00:05:31.560> plug<00:05:31.919> that

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
eighty thousand meters so we plug that

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.310 
eighty thousand meters so we plug that
into<00:05:32.460> there<00:05:32.820> and<00:05:33.000> we<00:05:33.240> multiplied<00:05:33.960> by<00:05:34.260> the

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
into there and we multiplied by the

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.670 
into there and we multiplied by the
frequency<00:05:34.950> and<00:05:35.340> we<00:05:35.970> get<00:05:36.270> a<00:05:36.300> velocity<00:05:36.540> of<00:05:37.260> four

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:37.680 
frequency and we get a velocity of four

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.730 
frequency and we get a velocity of four
six<00:05:38.100> four<00:05:38.460> meters<00:05:38.910> per<00:05:39.000> second<00:05:39.720> so<00:05:39.900> this<00:05:40.560> is

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
six four meters per second so this is

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.730 
six four meters per second so this is
the<00:05:40.890> velocity<00:05:41.640> of<00:05:41.669> the<00:05:42.060> object<00:05:42.090> found<00:05:42.990> at<00:05:43.350> the

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:43.740 
the velocity of the object found at the

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.330 
the velocity of the object found at the
equator<00:05:44.070> on<00:05:44.460> the<00:05:44.970> earth<00:05:45.270> so<00:05:46.140> now<00:05:46.410> let's

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:47.340 
equator on the earth so now let's

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.710 
equator on the earth so now let's
rearrange<00:05:47.850> this<00:05:48.780> equation<00:05:49.350> so<00:05:50.300> we<00:05:51.300> want<00:05:51.570> to

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 
rearrange this equation so we want to

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.170 
rearrange this equation so we want to
find<00:05:51.990> what<00:05:52.260> the<00:05:52.410> normal<00:05:52.860> force<00:05:53.100> is<00:05:53.400> so<00:05:54.060> the

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
find what the normal force is so the

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.480 
find what the normal force is so the
moral<00:05:54.600> force<00:05:54.900> after<00:05:55.169> we<00:05:55.590> arrange<00:05:55.979> this<00:05:56.250> is

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
moral force after we arrange this is

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.830 
moral force after we arrange this is
equal<00:05:56.970> to<00:05:57.180> mass<00:05:57.780> times<00:05:58.229> G<00:05:58.500> minus<00:05:59.360> mass<00:06:00.360> times

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
equal to mass times G minus mass times

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.890 
equal to mass times G minus mass times
the<00:06:01.200> square<00:06:01.680> divided<00:06:02.100> by<00:06:02.250> R<00:06:02.640> so<00:06:03.390> this<00:06:03.660> is<00:06:03.720> the

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 
the square divided by R so this is the

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.440 
the square divided by R so this is the
weight<00:06:04.350> of<00:06:04.650> the<00:06:05.130> person<00:06:05.400> found<00:06:05.940> at<00:06:06.300> the

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:06.450 
weight of the person found at the

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:09.080 
weight of the person found at the
equator<00:06:06.780> and<00:06:07.200> notice<00:06:08.040> that<00:06:08.280> it's<00:06:08.580> slightly

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:09.090 
equator and notice that it's slightly

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:12.320 
equator and notice that it's slightly
less<00:06:09.750> at<00:06:10.229> the<00:06:10.530> equator<00:06:10.890> then<00:06:11.580> at<00:06:11.910> the<00:06:12.060> North

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:12.330 
less at the equator then at the North

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.550 
less at the equator then at the North
Pole<00:06:12.660> it's<00:06:12.960> less<00:06:13.380> by<00:06:14.070> this<00:06:14.130> amount<00:06:15.060> so<00:06:15.560> when

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 
Pole it's less by this amount so when

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.460 
Pole it's less by this amount so when
the<00:06:16.740> person<00:06:17.010> is<00:06:17.400> standing<00:06:17.880> at<00:06:18.090> the<00:06:18.270> poles<00:06:18.600> we

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:19.470 
the person is standing at the poles we

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:22.280 
the person is standing at the poles we
see<00:06:19.770> that<00:06:19.979> our<00:06:20.190> force<00:06:21.090> the<00:06:21.450> gravitational

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:22.290 
see that our force the gravitational

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:25.100 
see that our force the gravitational
force<00:06:22.560> is<00:06:22.830> equal<00:06:23.310> to<00:06:23.400> the<00:06:23.520> normal<00:06:23.940> force<00:06:24.210> but

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.110 
force is equal to the normal force but

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:28.370 
force is equal to the normal force but
at<00:06:25.500> one<00:06:26.220> of<00:06:26.340> the<00:06:26.460> queries<00:06:27.150> on<00:06:27.330> the<00:06:27.390> equator<00:06:28.020> we

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:28.380 
at one of the queries on the equator we

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:28.890 
at one of the queries on the equator we
have<00:06:28.620> the

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:28.900 
have the

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:30.930 
have the
following<00:06:29.259> formula<00:06:29.800> so<00:06:30.009> it's<00:06:30.160> likely<00:06:30.460> less

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:30.940 
following formula so it's likely less

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:34.909 
following formula so it's likely less
what<00:06:31.870> about<00:06:32.229> our<00:06:32.530> gravitational<00:06:33.190> constant<00:06:33.820> G

00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:34.919 
what about our gravitational constant G

what about our gravitational constant G
well<00:06:35.919> let's<00:06:36.370> rearrange<00:06:36.699> our<00:06:37.240> equation<00:06:37.270> well

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:37.810 
well let's rearrange our equation well

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:39.689 
well let's rearrange our equation well
actually<00:06:37.930> let's<00:06:38.289> take<00:06:38.530> this<00:06:38.770> equation<00:06:39.009> and

00:06:39.689 --> 00:06:39.699 
actually let's take this equation and

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:43.409 
actually let's take this equation and
let's<00:06:40.210> rewrite<00:06:40.570> these<00:06:40.960> guys<00:06:41.350> as<00:06:41.740> mg<00:06:42.669> minus<00:06:42.699> mg

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:43.419 
let's rewrite these guys as mg minus mg

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:47.700 
let's rewrite these guys as mg minus mg
now<00:06:44.320> notice<00:06:44.979> these<00:06:45.610> two<00:06:46.000> G's<00:06:46.360> are<00:06:46.750> not<00:06:47.080> exactly

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:47.710 
now notice these two G's are not exactly

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:52.110 
now notice these two G's are not exactly
the<00:06:47.830> same<00:06:48.190> this<00:06:48.970> G<00:06:49.449> refers<00:06:50.259> to<00:06:50.550> 9.8<00:06:51.550> 0<00:06:51.910> meters

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:52.120 
the same this G refers to 9.8 0 meters

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.050 
the same this G refers to 9.8 0 meters
per<00:06:52.240> second<00:06:52.810> squared<00:06:53.169> but<00:06:53.740> this<00:06:53.770> G<00:06:54.370> is<00:06:54.610> the<00:06:54.820> G

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:55.060 
per second squared but this G is the G

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:57.629 
per second squared but this G is the G
we're<00:06:55.300> looking<00:06:55.870> for<00:06:56.169> we<00:06:56.320> want<00:06:56.590> to<00:06:56.770> find<00:06:57.039> this<00:06:57.340> G

00:06:57.629 --> 00:06:57.639 
we're looking for we want to find this G

00:06:57.639 --> 00:07:01.590 
we're looking for we want to find this G
so<00:06:58.270> notice<00:06:58.720> M<00:06:58.900> appears<00:06:59.590> on<00:06:59.889> every<00:07:00.070> single<00:07:00.600> term

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:01.600 
so notice M appears on every single term

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.469 
so notice M appears on every single term
so<00:07:01.930> we<00:07:02.050> can<00:07:02.169> cancel<00:07:02.440> the<00:07:02.710> ends<00:07:03.010> out<00:07:03.250> and<00:07:03.789> we<00:07:04.210> see

00:07:04.469 --> 00:07:04.479 
so we can cancel the ends out and we see

00:07:04.479 --> 00:07:08.610 
so we can cancel the ends out and we see
that<00:07:04.780> G<00:07:05.260> minus<00:07:05.830> G<00:07:05.860> prime<00:07:06.490> or<00:07:07.270> the<00:07:07.570> change<00:07:08.020> in<00:07:08.320> G

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:08.620 
that G minus G prime or the change in G

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.510 
that G minus G prime or the change in G
is<00:07:08.830> equal<00:07:09.130> to<00:07:09.610> V<00:07:09.970> squared<00:07:10.510> divided<00:07:11.199> by<00:07:11.350> R<00:07:11.830> so

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:12.520 
is equal to V squared divided by R so

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.210 
is equal to V squared divided by R so
let's<00:07:12.820> plug<00:07:13.180> in<00:07:13.419> our<00:07:13.830> velocity<00:07:14.830> and<00:07:15.039> let's

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:15.220 
let's plug in our velocity and let's

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:18.120 
let's plug in our velocity and let's
plug<00:07:15.490> in<00:07:15.639> our<00:07:15.760> radius<00:07:16.300> and<00:07:16.510> we<00:07:16.840> see<00:07:17.169> that<00:07:17.949> the

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:18.130 
plug in our radius and we see that the

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:20.580 
plug in our radius and we see that the
change<00:07:18.610> in<00:07:19.000> our<00:07:19.360> gravitational<00:07:20.320> constant

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:20.590 
change in our gravitational constant

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:25.100 
change in our gravitational constant
between<00:07:21.520> the<00:07:22.449> poles<00:07:22.810> and<00:07:23.229> the<00:07:23.289> equator<00:07:23.590> is

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:25.110 
between the poles and the equator is

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:29.040 
between the poles and the equator is
0.03<00:07:26.310> 37<00:07:27.310> meters<00:07:27.639> per<00:07:27.910> second<00:07:28.389> squared<00:07:28.780> so

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:29.050 
0.03 37 meters per second squared so

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:32.189 
0.03 37 meters per second squared so
there<00:07:29.949> is<00:07:30.280> in<00:07:30.490> fact<00:07:30.789> a<00:07:31.060> difference<00:07:31.780> in<00:07:32.020> the

00:07:32.189 --> 00:07:32.199 
there is in fact a difference in the

00:07:32.199 --> 00:07:35.100 
there is in fact a difference in the
gravitational<00:07:33.039> constant<00:07:33.310> if<00:07:34.000> you<00:07:34.539> compared

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:35.110 
gravitational constant if you compared

00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:37.980 
gravitational constant if you compared
at<00:07:35.349> the<00:07:35.830> pole<00:07:36.099> and<00:07:36.430> at<00:07:36.669> the<00:07:36.820> queer<00:07:37.120> and<00:07:37.539> the

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:37.990 
at the pole and at the queer and the

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:43.050 
at the pole and at the queer and the
difference<00:07:38.530> is<00:07:38.710> given<00:07:38.919> by<00:07:39.340> this<00:07:40.060> magnitude
