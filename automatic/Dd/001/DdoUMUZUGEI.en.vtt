00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:06.980
 hello how am I kicker nose this is 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.120
 prism tutorials today we will see how 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.610
 change hair color 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.110
 we will start creating a new layer and what 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.360
 let's fill in the color we want 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.679
 for this we come here and choose the 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.840
 tone that we are looking for me for example 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:19.220
 I'm going to choose an orange like this but 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.619
 do not worry because you can 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.539
 change at any time we give ok 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.460
 and now let's fill it with the boat 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.230
 of paint by clicking on any 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.239
 part of the image we already have a layer 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.859
 with the hair color now just 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:34.310
 we have to put it in fusion mode 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.960
 soft light and it will be painted okay for 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.670
 get it to only affect the hair we go 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.890
 to come the mask button and we're going to 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.750
 click on it but with alt pressed from 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.730
 this way we add a mask of 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.800
 black if you have gone out of color 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.930
 white click on command and to 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.090
 invest it or control and in windows is 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.500
 important that it be black 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.710
 now let's go to the brush tool 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.420
 we choose the white color and the opacity a 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.520
 butt we're also going to click with the 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.329
 right button and lower the hardness to the 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.980
 minimum 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.420
 Now we paint on the hair in the areas 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.950
 that we want to change the color so 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.360
 simple I'm going to do it a little 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.130
 quick for the tutorial to flow but 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.290
 it is important that you go little by little 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.480
 why 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.130
 you go over better if you stay in some 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.110
 areas like in these do not worry 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.180
 you can choose the color black in the 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.580
 brush and paint on the same mask 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:22.090
 to erase the areas where you do not want 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.260
 that there is dye is worth you can also 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.090
 try to lower the opacity in 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.200
 certain areas like for example me 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.820
 in this area here I'm going to make a 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.770
 little more degraded or even in the root 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.200
 so that it has a little dye but not 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.760
 much is worth now let's lower the 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.920
 opacity of the layer if necessary 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.200
 already the effect was very exaggerated and here 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.910
 you have it at any time you can 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.490
 change the hair color by adding a 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.200
 saturation tone adjustment layer if in 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.570
 this adjustment layer we put a mask 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.610
 of clipping that is this button here the 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.320
 adjustment will only affect the layer below 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.420
 that is to say the color of the hair so 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.430
 if we modify the tone it will be modified 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.830
 only the color of the hair also 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.080
 we can adjust the saturation to our 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.310
 taste as you can see there are parts that do not 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.020
 have been well painted as 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:04.180
 example is here but I can always 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.450
 go back to the mask and repaint 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.280
 black and white to adjust it 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.229
 good friends up here the tutorial of 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.209
 Today I recommend this other video that 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.129
 I did on how to select the hair for 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.810
 complex selections in the event that 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:17.610
 you want to paint hairs in motion 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.410
 etc. I hope you liked it 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.090

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.250
