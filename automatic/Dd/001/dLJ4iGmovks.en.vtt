00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 hi to all dear friends and welcome with 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.540
 me in this new video 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.420
 today we are back after a century on 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.880
 minecraft this time not for an episode 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.360
 of survival or for a texture pack 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.330
 showcase but this time I want to show you 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:22.439
 something I learned to do ie e 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:26.340
 fashions in vanilla minecraft with only one 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:31.529
 command let's start this mode right away 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:33.870
 I created is fashion is relative to file 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.730
 nights reds which as you may have noticed is a 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.520
 I like a casino game because 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:42.930
 I also made the file series golden eyes 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:47.309
 peas 2 on the canal if you haven't yet 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:50.700
 view go see it and consequently 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.050
 also created the characters from the series of 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.510
 partner pedis 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.989
 this however is a relative command only 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:01.800
 to the series of farnese birdies 1 then I will do 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.140
 with the related to farnese pedis 23 and then 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.939
 a single command that includes them all 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.500
 but that will also add others 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.820
 characters 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:15.210
 let's start immediately so let's take 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.930
 something to activate the command 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.840
 let's copy the command from the file that 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.930
 I will download from the link in 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:27.790
 description it is seen it gets the file is 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:30.410
 sure you don't worry about any viruses 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:34.970
 copy all the writings that are there 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:38.119
 inside the glued this koman block e 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.750
 you activate it before you saw that 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:45.800
 wrote one of the things in fact that 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.610
 was the command to receive the command 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.509
 blog 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:53.630
 ok the structure has been created now how to do it 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:58.280
 run this mode ie take a 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:03.290
 anvil placed then take 5 eggs 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.130
 of sheep each one you will call it in a 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:09.550
 different way 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:17.780
 the first for example cold calls 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:19.459
 the second perfect written bonnie the 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.890
 third 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:25.010
 c.ca ok is a treasure that is messed up 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:37.160
 ok 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:43.160
 c.ca then fox in cup 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:45.890
 then the last to cold or golden calls 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:48.650
 wrong life that must be capitalized 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.500
 otherwise nothing works 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.700
 as many of you will know, if you are 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.650
 seeing this you imagine 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.480
 know the series of file nights 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.880
 pretis 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.340
 inside there are the first game 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:05.360
 these five cool, friendly characters 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:08.890
 16th and golden cold cafÃ s these five 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:12.739
 I brought them back to minecraft 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:16.430
 placing sheep's eggs however with 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:19.250
 their names you wonder spawn was 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:22.459
 some sheep with the names above instead no 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:25.570
 all these nice commands need reason 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:29.440
 in fact when rohri mob spone 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:33.169
 but the sheep dies and evokes the 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.410
 character of Farnese of this sheep 

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:38.540
 it was what was called cold 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:41.810
 in fact, placing it, he evoked colds 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:45.400
 fast barry protagonist of everything ok 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:50.320
 away the second one called bami 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.320
 obviously it will conjure up boni dub years 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.260
 and the ugliest of the other the third which 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:00.790
 it is called about will obviously spur us on 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:05.200
 cada ceca is the fourth that is called foxy 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:08.350
 spawn was focsiv pirate fax and the last one 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:12.430
 golden cold spawn was a version of 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:15.280
 freddy but golden with his face always 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.830
 disturbing and then all the armor 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.870
 so high gold is not a big one 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:22.350
 protection that is the same that it would give 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.350
 the armor 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.970
 what is the name of the leather armor for 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.940
 it was right to make the effect if yes 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:36.460
 called golden, however cold golden 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:37.510
 made all gold there was as I have you 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.830
 said before 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:44.980
 to use this mode not really 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:47.910
 mode let's say you have to download the files from 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:51.430
 link that I put you in the description then 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:56.710
 copy all the writings there 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:59.260
 I'm in and paste them into a command 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:03.400
 bloc that as you have seen before 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:04.090
 so you get slashed up high 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.770
 right 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:10.450
 give snail player snail p o 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:17.220
 simply your name on 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:19.720
 minecraft command blog 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:25.210
 if you want more than a command blog 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:27.460
 write number from 1 to 64 however of 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:28.930
 default if you write only this one gives you a 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.600
 command bloc 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:34.000
 now I already had one then the other me 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:35.680
 he agreed he'd say that 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.420
 I can finish that video if there is 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.070
 liked left a comment I like 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.470
 if you want more information 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:43.360
 about this vanilla mode or those 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:46.270
 which I will do in the future 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:51.510
 always put the hashtag ado pays little 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:51.510
 and the question you want to do is see you
