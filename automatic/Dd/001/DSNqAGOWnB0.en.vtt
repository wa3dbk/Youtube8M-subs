a<00:05:31.020> sampling<00:05:31.889> of<00:05:32.039> it<00:05:32.220> in<00:05:32.430> New<00:05:32.580> Jersey<00:05:32.690> we<00:05:33.690> have<00:05:33.720> a

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
a sampling of it in New Jersey we have a

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.170 
a sampling of it in New Jersey we have a
new<00:05:33.990> arena<00:05:34.199> there<00:05:34.560> so<00:05:34.770> we<00:05:35.430> put<00:05:35.639> up<00:05:35.669> ten<00:05:35.970> nights

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
new arena there so we put up ten nights

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.779 
new arena there so we put up ten nights
that<00:05:36.449> sold<00:05:36.720> out<00:05:36.900> immediately<00:05:37.020> and<00:05:37.680> we<00:05:38.580> thought

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:38.789 
that sold out immediately and we thought

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:40.610 
that sold out immediately and we thought
like<00:05:38.940> guess<00:05:39.389> folks<00:05:39.780> still<00:05:40.139> want<00:05:40.289> to<00:05:40.320> see<00:05:40.500> it

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
like guess folks still want to see it

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.800 
like guess folks still want to see it
live<00:05:40.800> so<00:05:40.909> we'll<00:05:41.909> be<00:05:42.060> going<00:05:42.270> out<00:05:42.360> on<00:05:42.509> a<00:05:42.539> real

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810 
live so we'll be going out on a real

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.339 
live so we'll be going out on a real
tour<00:05:43.080> in<00:05:43.229> January<00:05:43.440> and<00:05:44.130> I<00:05:44.820> really<00:05:45.690> I<00:05:45.900> think<00:05:46.199> we

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:46.349 
tour in January and I really I think we

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:49.120 
tour in January and I really I think we
have<00:05:46.440> a<00:05:46.469> model<00:05:46.889> of<00:05:46.919> the<00:05:47.340> way<00:05:47.460> we<00:05:47.610> like<00:05:47.789> to<00:05:48.000> tour

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.130 
have a model of the way we like to tour

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:51.499 
have a model of the way we like to tour
it'll<00:05:50.130> be<00:05:50.250> a<00:05:50.280> combination<00:05:50.669> of<00:05:51.000> arenas<00:05:51.389> and

00:05:51.499 --> 00:05:51.509 
it'll be a combination of arenas and
