game I'm gonna cross out so the worst

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.979 
game I'm gonna cross out so the worst
called<00:00:41.520> Judi<00:00:41.790> in<00:00:41.910> theory<00:00:42.149> is<00:00:42.329> modern<00:00:42.840> warfare

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
called Judi in theory is modern warfare

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.910 
called Judi in theory is modern warfare
3<00:00:43.370> um<00:00:44.370> I<00:00:44.670> think<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.660> game<00:00:45.840> had<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.260> solid

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
3 um I think the game had a solid

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.190 
3 um I think the game had a solid
foundation<00:00:47.399> but<00:00:47.940> was<00:00:48.059> not<00:00:48.210> polished<00:00:48.690> as<00:00:48.899> well

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
foundation but was not polished as well

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.270 
foundation but was not polished as well
as<00:00:49.289> modern<00:00:49.469> warfare<00:00:49.620> 2<00:00:49.800> which<00:00:50.039> I'll<00:00:50.160> be

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
as modern warfare 2 which I'll be

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.130 
as modern warfare 2 which I'll be
crossing<00:00:50.640> out<00:00:50.760> secondly<00:00:51.239> modern<00:00:51.840> warfare<00:00:51.989> 3

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
crossing out secondly modern warfare 3

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.860 
crossing out secondly modern warfare 3

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
for for the whole series just like all

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.729 
for for the whole series just like all
the<00:03:13.620> Infinity<00:03:14.010> Ward<00:03:14.160> games<00:03:14.400> the<00:03:14.640> the<00:03:14.910> base<00:03:15.739> the

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
the Infinity Ward games the the base the

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.229 
the Infinity Ward games the the base the
system<00:03:17.160> that<00:03:17.340> it's<00:03:17.489> working<00:03:17.730> on<00:03:17.790> is<00:03:17.910> very<00:03:18.090> good

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
system that it's working on is very good

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.710 
system that it's working on is very good
but<00:03:18.510> it<00:03:19.700> simply<00:03:20.700> just<00:03:21.000> doesn't<00:03:21.269> compare<00:03:21.540> to

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
but it simply just doesn't compare to

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.410 
but it simply just doesn't compare to
the<00:03:21.930> modern<00:03:22.200> games<00:03:22.760> you<00:03:23.760> know<00:03:23.880> the

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
the modern games you know the

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.210 
the modern games you know the
scorestreak<00:03:25.019> simplicity<00:03:25.620> and<00:03:25.739> I<00:03:25.830> guess<00:03:26.040> it's

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
scorestreak simplicity and I guess it's

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.830 
scorestreak simplicity and I guess it's
kind<00:03:26.430> of<00:03:26.459> at<00:03:26.580> a<00:03:26.610> disadvantage<00:03:26.820> but<00:03:27.570> College

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
kind of at a disadvantage but College

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.330 
kind of at a disadvantage but College
before<00:03:28.019> is<00:03:28.320> a<00:03:28.350> very<00:03:28.590> good<00:03:28.709> game<00:03:28.860> that<00:03:28.920> a<00:03:29.070> lot<00:03:29.220> of

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
before is a very good game that a lot of

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.979 
before is a very good game that a lot of
people<00:03:29.640> do<00:03:29.790> consider<00:03:30.000> one<00:03:30.390> of<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:30.600> favorites

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
people do consider one of the favorites

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.229 
people do consider one of the favorites
of<00:03:31.110> all<00:03:31.260> time<00:03:31.500> but<00:03:31.739> me<00:03:31.920> I<00:03:32.100> don't<00:03:32.880> see<00:03:33.060> anything

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
of all time but me I don't see anything

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.600 
of all time but me I don't see anything
particular<00:03:33.989> fantastic<00:03:34.769> about<00:03:34.950> it<00:03:35.160> I<00:03:35.250> do<00:03:35.310> think

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
particular fantastic about it I do think

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.060 
particular fantastic about it I do think
simplicity<00:03:36.090> is<00:03:36.180> a<00:03:36.209> good<00:03:36.480> element<00:03:37.290> to<00:03:37.530> have<00:03:37.709> in

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
simplicity is a good element to have in

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.360 
simplicity is a good element to have in
most<00:03:38.880> areas<00:03:39.510> of<00:03:39.870> Call<00:03:40.230> of<00:03:40.260> Duty<00:03:40.370> class

everything<00:03:43.049> like<00:03:43.170> that<00:03:43.200> but<00:03:43.470> you<00:03:43.950> know

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
everything like that but you know

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.240 
everything like that but you know
overall<00:03:44.310> I'm<00:03:44.880> just<00:03:45.090> gonna<00:03:45.410> scratch<00:03:46.410> it<00:03:46.560> out<00:03:46.620> so

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
overall I'm just gonna scratch it out so

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.949 
overall I'm just gonna scratch it out so
now<00:03:47.400> that<00:03:47.489> leaves<00:03:47.760> us<00:03:47.880> with<00:03:48.030> black<00:03:48.299> ops<00:03:48.540> 2<00:03:48.750> and

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
now that leaves us with black ops 2 and

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.569 
now that leaves us with black ops 2 and
black<00:03:49.230> ops<00:03:49.410> 1<00:03:49.590> I'm<00:03:49.769> going<00:03:50.070> to<00:03:50.190> scratch<00:03:50.430> out

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
black ops 1 I'm going to scratch out

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:53.300 
black ops 1 I'm going to scratch out
black<00:03:50.820> ops<00:03:51.030> 2<00:03:51.209> too<00:03:51.900> much<00:03:52.170> focus<00:03:52.470> on<00:03:52.829> balance

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
black ops 2 too much focus on balance

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.039 
black ops 2 too much focus on balance
that<00:03:53.519> is<00:03:53.700> the<00:03:53.730> main<00:03:54.000> concern<00:03:54.510> I<00:03:54.810> have<00:03:55.019> with

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
that is the main concern I have with

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:58.729 
that is the main concern I have with
this<00:03:55.410> game<00:03:55.620> black<00:03:56.220> ops<00:03:56.430> 2<00:03:56.670> I<00:03:56.880> think<00:03:57.739> straight

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
this game black ops 2 I think straight

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.319 
this game black ops 2 I think straight
away<00:03:58.920> they<00:03:59.040> wanted<00:03:59.280> to<00:03:59.340> have<00:03:59.459> a<00:03:59.489> concern<00:04:00.000> that

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
away they wanted to have a concern that

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:02.180 
away they wanted to have a concern that
like<00:04:00.900> their<00:04:01.110> prime<00:04:01.410> I<00:04:01.620> feel<00:04:01.890> like<00:04:02.040> their

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
like their prime I feel like their

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.039 
like their prime I feel like their
primary<00:04:02.670> goal<00:04:02.880> going<00:04:03.209> into<00:04:03.420> the<00:04:03.510> project<00:04:03.720> -

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
primary goal going into the project -

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.020 
primary goal going into the project -
black<00:04:04.200> ops<00:04:04.380> 2<00:04:04.530> was<00:04:05.070> balanced<00:04:05.489> and<00:04:05.700> that's<00:04:05.760> good

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
black ops 2 was balanced and that's good

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.819 
black ops 2 was balanced and that's good
that's<00:04:06.060> what<00:04:06.360> I<00:04:06.420> like<00:04:06.630> but<00:04:07.110> there<00:04:07.680> wasn't

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
that's what I like but there wasn't

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:09.830 
that's what I like but there wasn't
enough<00:04:07.980> focus<00:04:08.400> on<00:04:08.549> fun<00:04:08.820> it<00:04:09.060> feels<00:04:09.480> like<00:04:09.630> it's<00:04:09.780> a

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
enough focus on fun it feels like it's a

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.630 
enough focus on fun it feels like it's a
little<00:04:09.900> bit<00:04:10.110> too<00:04:10.350> too<00:04:10.980> balanced<00:04:11.489> you<00:04:11.579> know

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
little bit too too balanced you know

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.030 
little bit too too balanced you know
it's<00:04:11.880> it's<00:04:12.060> so<00:04:12.150> bland<00:04:12.720> because<00:04:13.470> it's<00:04:13.829> just

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
it's it's so bland because it's just

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.890 
it's it's so bland because it's just
everything<00:04:14.459> ok<00:04:14.940> this<00:04:15.120> could<00:04:15.329> this<00:04:15.420> guns<00:04:15.660> got<00:04:15.840> a

everything ok this could this guns got a

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.539 
everything ok this could this guns got a
balance<00:04:16.290> out<00:04:16.410> with<00:04:16.560> this<00:04:16.680> one<00:04:16.859> and<00:04:17.130> you<00:04:17.430> know<00:04:17.519> I

like<00:04:35.390> I<00:04:35.510> said<00:04:35.720> I<00:04:35.900> like<00:04:36.200> the<00:04:36.380> score<00:04:36.620> streaks<00:04:36.890> in

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040

like I said I like the score streaks in
the<00:04:37.130> game<00:04:37.690> but<00:04:38.690> overall<00:04:39.320> I<00:04:39.530> just<00:04:39.560> don't<00:04:40.130> think

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
the game but overall I just don't think

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.210 
the game but overall I just don't think
it<00:04:40.490> is<00:04:40.640> as<00:04:40.880> good<00:04:41.450> as<00:04:41.720> what<00:04:42.500> I<00:04:42.530> think<00:04:42.920> is<00:04:43.070> the

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
it is as good as what I think is the

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.650 
it is as good as what I think is the
best<00:04:43.340> Call<00:04:43.610> of<00:04:43.640> Duty<00:04:43.910> game<00:04:44.060> in<00:04:44.240> history<00:04:44.540> in

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
best Call of Duty game in history in

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.260 
best Call of Duty game in history in
that<00:04:44.780> is<00:04:44.900> black<00:04:45.110> ops<00:04:45.320> 1<00:04:45.530> I<00:04:45.740> think<00:04:46.280> this<00:04:46.820> this

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
that is black ops 1 I think this this

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.400 
that is black ops 1 I think this this
struck<00:04:47.690> a<00:04:48.370> real<00:04:49.370> hit<00:04:49.970> with<00:04:50.150> me<00:04:50.360> with<00:04:51.020> the

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
struck a real hit with me with the

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.340 
struck a real hit with me with the
balance<00:04:51.830> between<00:04:52.030> simplicity<00:04:53.030> and

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
balance between simplicity and

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.240 
balance between simplicity and
complication<00:04:54.350> which<00:04:54.500> I<00:04:54.620> think<00:04:54.800> black<00:04:54.950> ops<00:04:55.130> 2

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
complication which I think black ops 2

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.070 
complication which I think black ops 2
is<00:04:55.310> a<00:04:55.370> little<00:04:55.490> bit<00:04:55.640> over<00:04:55.910> complicated<00:04:56.510> with

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
is a little bit over complicated with

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.480 
is a little bit over complicated with
the<00:04:57.260> the<00:04:57.470> pick<00:04:57.650> 10<00:04:57.830> which<00:04:58.010> i<00:04:58.100> think<00:04:58.160> is<00:04:58.460> a

00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:58.490 
the the pick 10 which i think is a

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.550 
the the pick 10 which i think is a
brilliant<00:04:58.970> idea<00:04:59.030> don't<00:04:59.900> get<00:05:00.050> me<00:05:00.170> wrong<00:05:00.230> but<00:05:00.500> I

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
brilliant idea don't get me wrong but I

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:01.630 
brilliant idea don't get me wrong but I
just<00:05:00.620> think<00:05:00.830> there's<00:05:00.980> a<00:05:01.100> little<00:05:01.250> bit<00:05:01.340> too<00:05:01.460> many

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:01.640 
just think there's a little bit too many

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.830 
just think there's a little bit too many
options<00:05:02.060> for<00:05:02.120> us<00:05:02.390> here<00:05:02.680> you<00:05:03.680> know<00:05:03.770> black<00:05:04.010> ops<00:05:04.220> 1

options for us here you know black ops 1

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.020 
options for us here you know black ops 1
obviously<00:05:05.840> a<00:05:06.290> a<00:05:06.650> great<00:05:07.220> game<00:05:07.460> with<00:05:07.640> a<00:05:07.700> lot<00:05:07.910> of

obviously a a great game with a lot of

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:09.550 
obviously a a great game with a lot of
flaws<00:05:08.210> again<00:05:08.690> there's<00:05:08.930> not<00:05:09.080> a<00:05:09.110> single

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:09.560 
flaws again there's not a single

flawless call duty game here besides
black<00:05:12.050> ops<00:05:12.290> 2<00:05:12.470> is<00:05:12.620> more<00:05:12.830> flawless<00:05:13.070> than<00:05:13.370> black

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
black ops 2 is more flawless than black

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.460 
black ops 2 is more flawless than black
ops<00:05:13.730> 1<00:05:13.910> but<00:05:14.090> I<00:05:14.120> still<00:05:14.360> pick<00:05:14.660> black<00:05:14.900> ops<00:05:15.080> 1<00:05:15.230> over

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
ops 1 but I still pick black ops 1 over

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:16.990 
ops 1 but I still pick black ops 1 over
the<00:05:15.920> FAMAS<00:05:16.250> obviously<00:05:16.700> a<00:05:16.730> little<00:05:16.880> bit

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
the FAMAS obviously a little bit

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.490 
the FAMAS obviously a little bit
overpowered<00:05:17.450> but<00:05:17.570> after<00:05:17.750> the<00:05:17.840> patch<00:05:18.020> I<00:05:18.200> really

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
overpowered but after the patch I really

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.660 
overpowered but after the patch I really
don't<00:05:18.650> see<00:05:18.800> a<00:05:18.830> problem<00:05:19.070> with<00:05:19.220> it<00:05:19.310> I<00:05:19.460> don't<00:05:19.610> know

what people complain about I get on the

post up with the FAMAS and overall

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:29.470 
post up with the FAMAS and overall
that's<00:05:27.500> the<00:05:27.710> first<00:05:27.950> game<00:05:28.130> that<00:05:28.160> we<00:05:28.430> got<00:05:28.640> where

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:29.480 
that's the first game that we got where

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.960 
that's the first game that we got where
you<00:05:29.930> know<00:05:30.230> there<00:05:30.380> was<00:05:30.470> decent<00:05:31.040> weapon<00:05:31.610> balance

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:31.970 
you know there was decent weapon balance

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:33.640 
you know there was decent weapon balance
I<00:05:32.060> think<00:05:32.090> a<00:05:32.330> lot<00:05:32.510> of<00:05:32.540> guns<00:05:32.780> were<00:05:32.930> underpowered

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
I think a lot of guns were underpowered

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.250 
I think a lot of guns were underpowered
on<00:05:33.950> that<00:05:34.130> game<00:05:34.340> but<00:05:34.520> there<00:05:34.700> was<00:05:34.820> nothing

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:35.260 
on that game but there was nothing

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.500 
on that game but there was nothing
