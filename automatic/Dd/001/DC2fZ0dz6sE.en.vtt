00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.440 

about<00:00:10.840> what<00:00:10.990> we<00:00:11.080> have<00:00:11.290> here<00:00:11.620> and<00:00:12.300> some<00:00:13.300> of<00:00:13.390> the

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:13.450 
about what we have here and some of the

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.330 
about what we have here and some of the
differences<00:00:13.750> so<00:00:14.140> the<00:00:14.320> first<00:00:14.470> thing<00:00:14.650> is<00:00:14.890> the

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:15.340 
differences so the first thing is the

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.880 
differences so the first thing is the
instinct<00:00:16.270> and<00:00:16.420> intuition<00:00:16.750> this<00:00:17.320> is<00:00:17.440> our<00:00:17.680> only

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:17.890 
instinct and intuition this is our only

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.800 
instinct and intuition this is our only
portion<00:00:18.550> in<00:00:18.670> terms<00:00:18.850> of<00:00:18.970> Norfolk<00:00:19.360> so<00:00:19.510> how's<00:00:19.690> the

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:19.810 
portion in terms of Norfolk so how's the

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.060 
portion in terms of Norfolk so how's the
same<00:00:19.960> amount<00:00:20.050> of<00:00:20.260> four<00:00:20.470> foot<00:00:20.680> cushion<00:00:20.860> is

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.070 
same amount of four foot cushion is

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.890 
same amount of four foot cushion is
pretty<00:00:21.310> much<00:00:21.430> any<00:00:21.580> other<00:00:21.670> shoe<00:00:21.970> out<00:00:22.150> there<00:00:22.450> but

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:22.900 
pretty much any other shoe out there but

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.840 
pretty much any other shoe out there but
you<00:00:23.230> don't<00:00:23.380> have<00:00:23.500> that<00:00:23.619> big<00:00:24.039> elevated<00:00:24.580> feel

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
there's a lance for a much more natural

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:43.749 
intuition and I have the instinct which

00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:46.290 
intuition and I have the instinct which
is<00:00:43.929> our<00:00:44.050> men's<00:00:44.229> version<00:00:44.409> right<00:00:44.620> here<00:00:44.769> and<00:00:45.609> if

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
is our men's version right here and if

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.610 
is our men's version right here and if
my<00:00:46.600> understand<00:00:46.870> is<00:00:46.989> right<00:00:47.109> you<00:00:47.199> guys<00:00:47.319> are<00:00:47.499> also

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
my understand is right you guys are also

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.979 
my understand is right you guys are also
making<00:00:47.949> a<00:00:48.219> women<00:00:48.699> there's<00:00:49.359> a<00:00:49.389> lot<00:00:49.479> more<00:00:49.510> women

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
making a women there's a lot more women

making a women there's a lot more women
specificity<00:00:50.710> in<00:00:50.859> this<00:00:51.010> shoe<00:00:51.159> the<00:00:51.309> maybe<00:00:51.489> we

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:51.639 
specificity in this shoe the maybe we

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:53.160 
specificity in this shoe the maybe we
might<00:00:51.789> find<00:00:52.030> another<00:00:52.239> traditional<00:00:52.659> tapas<00:00:52.839> can

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
might find another traditional tapas can

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.919 
might find another traditional tapas can
tell<00:00:53.319> something<00:00:53.559> that's<00:00:54.069> correct<00:00:54.309> so<00:00:54.929> women's

00:00:55.919 --> 00:00:55.929 
tell something that's correct so women's

00:00:55.929 --> 00:00:57.660 
tell something that's correct so women's
women's<00:00:56.499> be<00:00:56.769> tend<00:00:57.069> to<00:00:57.129> be<00:00:57.190> a<00:00:57.219> little<00:00:57.280> more<00:00:57.399> d

women's be tend to be a little more d

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.879 
women's be tend to be a little more d
shapes<00:00:57.999> they<00:00:58.749> also<00:00:58.870> tend<00:00:59.170> to<00:00:59.260> have<00:00:59.440> shorter

00:00:59.879 --> 00:00:59.889 
shapes they also tend to have shorter

00:00:59.889 --> 00:01:01.949 
shapes they also tend to have shorter
toes<00:01:00.129> and<00:01:00.459> longer<00:01:01.089> hard<00:01:01.299> to<00:01:01.449> the<00:01:01.690> higher

instep<00:01:02.469> along<00:01:02.799> the<00:01:02.920> top<00:01:03.100> of<00:01:03.129> the<00:01:03.280> foot<00:01:03.459> our

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
instep along the top of the foot our

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.480 
instep along the top of the foot our
shoe<00:01:04.449> accounts<00:01:04.809> for<00:01:04.899> that<00:01:05.079> which<00:01:06.009> is<00:01:06.039> why<00:01:06.280> we

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
shoe accounts for that which is why we

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.639 
shoe accounts for that which is why we
named<00:01:06.850> the<00:01:06.969> shoes<00:01:07.149> differently<00:01:07.539> and<00:01:07.780> which<00:01:08.530> is

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:08.649 
named the shoes differently and which is

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:09.959 
named the shoes differently and which is
why<00:01:08.770> women<00:01:08.950> should<00:01:09.280> have<00:01:09.460> their<00:01:09.670> own<00:01:09.700> fit

00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:09.969 
why women should have their own fit

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:11.310 
why women should have their own fit
until<00:01:10.180> we're<00:01:10.360> unfortunately<00:01:10.930> most<00:01:11.079> shoe

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
until we're unfortunately most shoe

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.980 
until we're unfortunately most shoe
companies<00:01:11.710> just<00:01:12.640> shrink<00:01:13.180> their<00:01:13.390> men's<00:01:13.570> models

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
companies just shrink their men's models

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.840 
companies just shrink their men's models
and<00:01:14.110> call<00:01:14.289> it<00:01:14.409> women's<00:01:14.680> shoe<00:01:14.770> so<00:01:15.189> ours<00:01:15.640> are

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
and call it women's shoe so ours are

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.260 
and call it women's shoe so ours are
unique<00:01:16.539> to<00:01:16.570> that<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.890> and<00:01:18.670> also<00:01:18.939> you<00:01:19.030> guys<00:01:19.149> are

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
unique to that and and also you guys are

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.880 
unique to that and and also you guys are
doing<00:01:19.420> really<00:01:19.509> unique<00:01:19.960> things<00:01:20.200> in<00:01:20.380> terms<00:01:20.530> of

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
doing really unique things in terms of

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.859 
doing really unique things in terms of
the<00:01:21.579> cushioning<00:01:22.149> that<00:01:22.299> you<00:01:22.359> guys<00:01:22.539> have<00:01:22.780> in

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
the cushioning that you guys have in

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:24.209 
the cushioning that you guys have in
there<00:01:22.990> so<00:01:23.079> it's<00:01:23.200> not<00:01:23.289> just<00:01:23.530> a<00:01:23.590> traditional

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:24.219 
there so it's not just a traditional

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:26.670 
there so it's not just a traditional
aviators<00:01:24.880> I<00:01:25.060> find<00:01:25.299> almost<00:01:25.509> any<00:01:26.170> just<00:01:26.380> look<00:01:26.409> at

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
aviators I find almost any just look at

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.999 
aviators I find almost any just look at
the<00:01:26.770> church<00:01:27.130> what<00:01:27.430> makes<00:01:27.609> that<00:01:27.700> so<00:01:28.210> we<00:01:28.570> use<00:01:28.750> a

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
the church what makes that so we use a

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.450 
the church what makes that so we use a
gba<00:01:30.009> midsole<00:01:30.520> we<00:01:31.179> then<00:01:31.390> use<00:01:31.600> an<00:01:31.780> a<00:01:32.020> bound

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
gba midsole we then use an a bound

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.590 
gba midsole we then use an a bound
struggle<00:01:33.460> so<00:01:33.640> that's<00:01:33.820> the<00:01:33.939> struggle<00:01:34.240> is<00:01:34.390> once

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
struggle so that's the struggle is once

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.440 
struggle so that's the struggle is once
against<00:01:35.049> the<00:01:35.170> foot

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
against the foot

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.719 
against the foot
and<00:01:35.840> we<00:01:36.110> use<00:01:36.229> a<00:01:36.259> material<00:01:36.409> that's<00:01:36.649> 10<00:01:36.979> times<00:01:37.369> as

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
and we use a material that's 10 times as

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.420 
and we use a material that's 10 times as
durable<00:01:38.240> as<00:01:38.299> EPA<00:01:39.229> and<00:01:39.530> that's<00:01:40.100> what<00:01:40.280> your<00:01:40.399> dad

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
durable as EPA and that's what your dad

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.459 
durable as EPA and that's what your dad
is<00:01:40.700> what's<00:01:40.909> against<00:01:41.360> a<00:01:41.479> foot<00:01:41.719> we<00:01:42.110> don't<00:01:42.320> also

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:42.469 
is what's against a foot we don't also

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:45.370 
is what's against a foot we don't also
use<00:01:42.740> it<00:01:42.860> in<00:01:42.979> pots<00:01:43.280> it<00:01:44.210> is<00:01:44.329> full<00:01:44.750> length<00:01:45.049> no

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
use it in pots it is full length no

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.319 
use it in pots it is full length no
slits<00:01:45.740> no<00:01:46.039> pods<00:01:46.310> nothing<00:01:46.820> so<00:01:46.939> it's<00:01:47.060> natural

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:47.329 
slits no pods nothing so it's natural
