00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
definite one of the game's developers

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.990 
definite one of the game's developers
using<00:03:54.620> their<00:03:54.829> imagination<00:03:55.489> on<00:03:55.700> the<00:03:55.849> game

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
using their imagination on the game

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.180 
using their imagination on the game
itself<00:03:56.299> and<00:03:56.900> I<00:03:57.410> think<00:03:57.620> it's<00:03:57.739> pretty<00:03:57.890> fantastic

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.190 
itself and I think it's pretty fantastic

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.550 
itself and I think it's pretty fantastic
to<00:03:58.730> see<00:03:58.819> something<00:03:59.269> like<00:03:59.510> that<00:03:59.750> in<00:03:59.900> a<00:03:59.930> game<00:04:00.170> now

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
to see something like that in a game now

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.080 
to see something like that in a game now
it<00:04:00.890> does<00:04:01.040> get<00:04:01.160> a<00:04:01.220> little<00:04:01.310> stale<00:04:01.609> because<00:04:01.849> it's

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
it does get a little stale because it's

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.880 
it does get a little stale because it's
all<00:04:02.269> your<00:04:02.420> doing<00:04:02.540> but<00:04:03.049> that's<00:04:03.560> what<00:04:03.709> mobile

probably<00:05:34.840> my<00:05:35.080> game<00:05:35.319> oh<00:05:40.620> I<00:05:41.620> see<00:05:41.770> okay<00:05:42.430> so<00:05:42.490> you

00:05:42.689 --> 00:05:42.699 
probably my game oh I see okay so you

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:44.369 
probably my game oh I see okay so you
can<00:05:42.819> only<00:05:42.969> hit<00:05:43.150> the<00:05:43.270> mobs<00:05:43.479> at<00:05:43.659> certain<00:05:43.960> points

00:05:44.369 --> 00:05:44.379 
can only hit the mobs at certain points

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:48.170 
can only hit the mobs at certain points
I<00:05:44.530> think<00:05:44.979> when<00:05:45.069> they<00:05:45.159> have<00:05:45.310> their<00:05:45.430> eyes<00:05:45.639> open

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.670 

these<00:05:49.180> are<00:05:49.300> faster<00:05:49.780> version<00:05:49.930> the<00:05:50.320> other<00:05:50.470> days

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680 
these are faster version the other days

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.010 
these are faster version the other days
I<00:05:50.860> was<00:05:51.010> fighting<00:05:51.240> so<00:05:52.240> the<00:05:52.330> game<00:05:52.480> has<00:05:52.660> some<00:05:52.870> nice

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.020 
I was fighting so the game has some nice

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:55.410 
I was fighting so the game has some nice
progressive<00:05:53.590> difficulty<00:05:54.160> doesn't<00:05:54.970> get<00:05:55.060> extra

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:55.420 
progressive difficulty doesn't get extra

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.750 
progressive difficulty doesn't get extra
overbearing<00:05:56.350> at<00:05:56.800> one<00:05:57.010> point<00:05:57.250> I'm<00:05:57.460> sure<00:05:57.640> it's

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:57.760 
overbearing at one point I'm sure it's

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.520 
overbearing at one point I'm sure it's
me<00:05:57.880> get<00:05:58.000> much<00:05:58.150> more<00:05:58.330> later<00:05:58.930> on<00:05:59.020> the<00:05:59.170> test<00:05:59.380> your

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.750 
that give us some progressive difficulty

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.990 
that give us some progressive difficulty
that<00:06:04.840> make<00:06:04.990> things<00:06:05.200> a<00:06:05.320> bit<00:06:05.350> harder<00:06:05.830> and<00:06:06.250> the
