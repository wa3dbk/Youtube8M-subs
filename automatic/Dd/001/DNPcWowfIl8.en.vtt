00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.199 
Ken down for the cover of the album
which<00:02:32.470> I<00:02:32.770> looked<00:02:33.010> at<00:02:33.220> and<00:02:33.280> I<00:02:33.670> honest<00:02:34.030> I<00:02:34.090> was

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
which I looked at and I honest I was

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:35.699 
which I looked at and I honest I was
like<00:02:34.360> that<00:02:34.600> it's<00:02:34.720> gonna<00:02:34.930> be<00:02:35.050> like<00:02:35.380> I<00:02:35.530> thought

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
like that it's gonna be like I thought

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.229 
like that it's gonna be like I thought
it<00:02:35.770> was<00:02:35.950> first<00:02:36.190> I<00:02:36.580> didn't<00:02:36.910> think<00:02:37.030> it<00:02:37.120> was

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
it was first I didn't think it was

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:40.140 
it was first I didn't think it was
Matisse<00:02:37.630> but<00:02:37.930> I<00:02:37.959> thought<00:02:38.200> not<00:02:38.410> so<00:02:38.580> similar<00:02:39.580> in

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
Matisse but I thought not so similar in

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.030 
Matisse but I thought not so similar in
composition<00:02:40.420> and<00:02:40.840> whatever<00:02:41.170> and<00:02:41.290> then<00:02:41.410> so<00:02:41.769> for

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
composition and whatever and then so for

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.530 
composition and whatever and then so for
you<00:02:42.100> to<00:02:42.130> tell<00:02:42.310> me<00:02:42.370> that<00:02:42.459> Ken<00:02:42.790> don't<00:02:43.060> tell<00:02:43.450> me

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
you to tell me that Ken don't tell me

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.190 
you to tell me that Ken don't tell me
how<00:02:43.660> that<00:02:43.720> came<00:02:44.050> about<00:02:45.239> well<00:02:46.239> when<00:02:46.959> we

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
how that came about well when we

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.199 
how that came about well when we
recorded<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:47.680> album<00:02:47.980> in<00:02:48.100> Santa<00:02:48.550> Monica<00:02:48.700> and
