00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
I think the procedure of being kind of

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
designs not really my thing I've always

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.779 
designs not really my thing I've always
been<00:01:00.750> told<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.109> it's<00:01:01.410> not<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.920> gloves<00:01:02.670> but

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
been told that it's not the gloves but

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.359 
been told that it's not the gloves but
the<00:01:03.030> hand<00:01:03.239> inside<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.750> so<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:04.350> believe<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.339> I

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
the hand inside it so I believe that I

the hand inside it so I believe that I
can<00:01:05.430> catch<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.939> ball<00:01:06.090> in<00:01:06.119> any<00:01:06.330> gloves<00:01:06.630> but<00:01:06.869> I

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
can catch the ball in any gloves but I

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.109 
can catch the ball in any gloves but I
just<00:01:08.040> always<00:01:08.159> feel<00:01:08.369> very<00:01:08.549> comfortable<00:01:08.700> in

just always feel very comfortable in
condition

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
condition

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.289 
condition
I<00:01:12.830> wore<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:14.130> new<00:01:14.369> pair<00:01:14.580> of<00:01:14.610> gloves<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.970> few<00:01:15.119> times

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
I wore a new pair of gloves a few times

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.690 
I wore a new pair of gloves a few times
the<00:01:15.420> season<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.500> every<00:01:17.100> time<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.280> kept<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.549> clean

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
the season and every time I kept a clean

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.090 
the season and every time I kept a clean
sheet<00:01:17.790> I<00:01:18.000> keep<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.299> same<00:01:18.450> pair<00:01:18.900> of<00:01:18.930> gloves<00:01:19.170> so

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
sheet I keep the same pair of gloves so

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.550 
sheet I keep the same pair of gloves so
I<00:01:20.130> only<00:01:20.369> change<00:01:20.700> yourself<00:01:21.150> conceded<00:01:21.570> so

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
I only change yourself conceded so

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.230 
I only change yourself conceded so
basically<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:23.189> goes<00:01:23.340> like<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.700> concealer<00:01:24.000> goal

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.969 
basically it goes like a concealer goal
and<00:01:24.509> I<00:01:24.720> wear<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:24.990> gloves<00:01:25.200> for<00:01:25.259> training<00:01:25.680> and

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479
