00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
basic flash animation tutorial in this

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.299 
basic flash animation tutorial in this
tutorial<00:00:06.210> I<00:00:06.720> will<00:00:07.259> be<00:00:07.350> creating<00:00:07.589> an<00:00:07.890> animation

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
tutorial I will be creating an animation

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.820 
tutorial I will be creating an animation
of<00:00:08.639> a<00:00:09.480> Sun<00:00:10.260> rising<00:00:10.769> over<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.070> horizon<00:00:12.710> so<00:00:13.710> the

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
of a Sun rising over the horizon so the

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.829 
of a Sun rising over the horizon so the
first<00:00:14.040> thing<00:00:14.280> we<00:00:14.400> want<00:00:14.610> to<00:00:14.670> do<00:00:14.849> is<00:00:15.389> create

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
first thing we want to do is create

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.930 
first thing we want to do is create
several<00:00:16.199> layers<00:00:16.500> for<00:00:16.890> our<00:00:16.980> various<00:00:17.340> objects

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
several layers for our various objects

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.840 
several layers for our various objects
in<00:00:18.090> our<00:00:18.210> animation<00:00:18.570> and<00:00:19.279> the<00:00:20.279> way<00:00:20.400> we<00:00:20.550> do<00:00:20.699> that

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
in our animation and the way we do that

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.359 
in our animation and the way we do that
is<00:00:21.119> we<00:00:21.990> come<00:00:22.140> up<00:00:22.230> here<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.740> we<00:00:22.890> right-click

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
is we come up here and we right-click

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.390 
is we come up here and we right-click
and<00:00:23.640> select<00:00:24.390> insert<00:00:24.900> layer<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.439> you're<00:00:26.279> going

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
and select insert layer and you're going

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.460 
and select insert layer and you're going
to<00:00:26.460> want<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.670> do<00:00:26.849> that<00:00:27.000> about<00:00:27.570> five<00:00:27.900> times<00:00:28.170> so

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
to want to do that about five times so

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.319 
to want to do that about five times so
we<00:00:28.560> have<00:00:28.680> five<00:00:28.920> layers<00:00:30.949> okay<00:00:31.949> so<00:00:32.460> now<00:00:32.610> what<00:00:33.210> we

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
we have five layers okay so now what we

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.410 
we have five layers okay so now what we
want<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.600> do<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:34.079> we<00:00:34.380> want<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.649> draw<00:00:34.920> our

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.510 
sky and we're going to want to name our
layers<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.890> something<00:00:50.219> more<00:00:50.460> descriptive

boom there's the Sun now in order to

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:51.999 
boom there's the Sun now in order to
animate<00:01:50.149> an<00:01:50.780> object<00:01:50.959> we<00:01:51.530> have<00:01:51.649> to<00:01:51.799> first

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
animate an object we have to first

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.940 
animate an object we have to first
convert<00:01:52.429> it<00:01:52.759> into<00:01:52.939> a<00:01:53.060> symbol<00:01:53.390> and<00:01:53.780> the<00:01:54.709> way<00:01:54.799> we

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
convert it into a symbol and the way we

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.830 
convert it into a symbol and the way we
do<00:01:55.130> that<00:01:55.280> it's<00:01:55.789> first<00:01:56.119> you<00:01:56.329> select<00:01:56.509> your

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
do that it's first you select your

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.999 
do that it's first you select your
object<00:01:57.319> and<00:01:57.530> then<00:01:58.130> you<00:01:58.159> hit<00:01:58.340> f8<00:01:59.649> now<00:02:00.649> our

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
object and then you hit f8 now our

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:02.679 
object and then you hit f8 now our
symbols<00:02:01.399> are<00:02:01.520> going<00:02:01.640> to<00:02:01.700> be<00:02:01.789> graphics<00:02:02.299> because

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
symbols are going to be graphics because

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:04.209 
symbols are going to be graphics because
they're<00:02:03.140> not<00:02:03.229> going<00:02:03.500> to<00:02:03.560> be<00:02:03.679> animated

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
we're going to lock the sky layer now

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.199 
we're going to lock the sky layer now
you'll<00:02:48.230> notice<00:02:48.410> if<00:02:48.739> I<00:02:48.889> click<00:02:48.970> it's<00:02:49.970> not

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
so now I'm going to draw in the ground

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.809 
so now I'm going to draw in the ground
here<00:03:06.459> and<00:03:07.459> to<00:03:07.550> make<00:03:07.700> this<00:03:07.880> green<00:03:09.459> they<00:03:10.459> start

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.600 

I<00:03:39.480> don't<00:03:40.230> want<00:03:40.380> these<00:03:40.470> line<00:03:40.800> segments<00:03:41.310> here<00:03:41.459> so

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
I don't want these line segments here so

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:45.320 
I don't want these line segments here so
the<00:03:41.670> selector<00:03:42.270> is<00:03:42.300> and<00:03:42.630> hit<00:03:42.750> delete<00:03:43.110> and<00:03:44.330> there

the selector is and hit delete and there

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.650 
the selector is and hit delete and there
we<00:03:45.450> go<00:03:45.569> nice<00:03:45.989> little<00:03:46.380> cloud<00:03:47.300> now<00:03:48.300> I'm<00:03:48.420> going<00:03:48.569> to

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
we go nice little cloud now I'm going to

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.750 
we go nice little cloud now I'm going to
convert<00:03:49.080> this<00:03:49.290> cloud<00:03:49.620> to<00:03:49.980> assemble<00:03:50.430> as<00:03:50.550> well

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
convert this cloud to assemble as well

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.920 
convert this cloud to assemble as well
select<00:03:51.630> the<00:03:51.720> cloud<00:03:51.930> if<00:03:52.560> hit<00:03:52.980> f8<00:03:53.780> named<00:03:54.780> it

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
select the cloud if hit f8 named it

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.830 
select the cloud if hit f8 named it
cloud<00:03:55.940> you'll<00:03:56.940> notice<00:03:57.239> that<00:03:57.420> once<00:03:57.690> you

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
cloud you'll notice that once you

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.840 
cloud you'll notice that once you
convert<00:03:58.290> an<00:03:58.590> object<00:03:59.069> into<00:03:59.340> a<00:03:59.370> symbol<00:03:59.640> you'll

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
convert an object into a symbol you'll

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.330 
convert an object into a symbol you'll
have<00:04:00.000> this<00:04:00.120> nice<00:04:00.330> little<00:04:00.750> blue<00:04:01.500> box<00:04:01.770> around<00:04:02.130> it

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
have this nice little blue box around it

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.949 
have this nice little blue box around it
and<00:04:02.370> that<00:04:02.600> indicates<00:04:03.600> that<00:04:03.959> it<00:04:04.140> is<00:04:04.170> a<00:04:04.560> symbol

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
and that indicates that it is a symbol

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.570 
and that indicates that it is a symbol
okay<00:04:06.959> last<00:04:07.319> but<00:04:07.470> not<00:04:07.680> least<00:04:07.980> we're<00:04:08.310> going<00:04:08.489> to

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
okay last but not least we're going to

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.960 
okay last but not least we're going to
draw<00:04:08.819> our<00:04:09.060> tree<00:04:09.540> so<00:04:10.530> using<00:04:11.340> the<00:04:11.430> paintbrush

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
draw our tree so using the paintbrush

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:19.210 
draw our tree so using the paintbrush
tool<00:04:12.590> select<00:04:13.590> a<00:04:13.709> nice<00:04:14.239> brown<00:04:15.239> color<00:04:16.459> draw<00:04:17.459> an

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
tool select a nice brown color draw an

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.900 
tool select a nice brown color draw an
stump<00:04:20.220> there<00:04:20.489> and<00:04:21.260> then<00:04:22.260> an<00:04:22.410> oval

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.020 

for<00:04:25.450> the<00:04:25.540> branches<00:04:25.960> and<00:04:26.230> the<00:04:26.290> leaves<00:04:26.940> there<00:04:27.940> we

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
for the branches and the leaves there we

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.290 
for the branches and the leaves there we
go<00:04:28.180> that's<00:04:28.840> a<00:04:28.960> pretty<00:04:29.110> good<00:04:29.290> tree<00:04:29.940> now<00:04:30.940> another

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
go that's a pretty good tree now another

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.470 
go that's a pretty good tree now another
way<00:04:31.480> of<00:04:31.600> selecting<00:04:31.930> things<00:04:32.410> is<00:04:32.800> to<00:04:33.790> lock<00:04:34.180> all

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
way of selecting things is to lock all

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.570 
way of selecting things is to lock all
the<00:04:34.720> layers<00:04:34.930> now<00:04:35.530> we<00:04:35.590> can't<00:04:35.890> select<00:04:36.160> anything

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
the layers now we can't select anything

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.990 
the layers now we can't select anything
and<00:04:36.790> then<00:04:37.330> just<00:04:37.990> unlock<00:04:38.440> the<00:04:38.800> one<00:04:39.520> layer<00:04:39.790> that

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
and then just unlock the one layer that

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.020 
and then just unlock the one layer that
you<00:04:40.120> want<00:04:40.150> to<00:04:40.600> select<00:04:41.020> or<00:04:41.470> modify<00:04:42.100> so<00:04:42.880> in<00:04:42.970> this

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 
you want to select or modify so in this

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.060 
you want to select or modify so in this
case<00:04:43.270> we<00:04:43.420> want<00:04:43.600> to<00:04:43.720> only<00:04:44.230> want<00:04:44.500> to<00:04:44.560> get<00:04:44.770> at<00:04:44.920> this

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:45.070 
case we want to only want to get at this

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:47.190 
case we want to only want to get at this
tree<00:04:45.460> here<00:04:45.760> so<00:04:46.180> we're<00:04:46.360> going<00:04:46.450> to<00:04:46.540> unlock<00:04:46.900> this

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
tree here so we're going to unlock this

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.620 
tree here so we're going to unlock this
layer<00:04:47.440> now<00:04:47.740> we're<00:04:48.730> going<00:04:48.820> to<00:04:48.880> select<00:04:49.150> all<00:04:49.450> this

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630

stuff<00:04:49.930> here<00:04:50.200> and<00:04:50.350> hit<00:04:51.160> f8<00:04:51.840> crawl<00:04:52.840> it<00:04:52.990> the<00:04:53.110> tree

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
stuff here and hit f8 crawl it the tree

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.390 
stuff here and hit f8 crawl it the tree
and<00:04:53.910> boom<00:04:54.910> there's<00:04:55.270> our<00:04:55.360> tree<00:04:55.690> and<00:04:56.400> let's

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
and boom there's our tree and let's

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.520 
and boom there's our tree and let's
unlock<00:04:58.030> all<00:04:58.270> these<00:04:58.420> layers<00:04:58.660> here<00:04:58.960> so<00:04:59.020> we<00:04:59.290> can

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
unlock all these layers here so we can

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.130 
unlock all these layers here so we can
see<00:04:59.880> we've<00:05:00.880> got<00:05:01.060> these<00:05:01.240> all<00:05:01.420> converted<00:05:01.960> into

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:02.140 
see we've got these all converted into

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:04.680 
see we've got these all converted into
symbols<00:05:02.830> now<00:05:03.040> up<00:05:03.610> except<00:05:04.030> for<00:05:04.150> this<00:05:04.240> one<00:05:04.300> I

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690 
symbols now up except for this one I

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:06.570 
symbols now up except for this one I
forgot<00:05:05.020> about<00:05:05.230> that<00:05:05.350> one<00:05:05.590> so<00:05:05.740> lock<00:05:06.190> all<00:05:06.430> these

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
forgot about that one so lock all these

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.610 
forgot about that one so lock all these
layers<00:05:07.380> and<00:05:08.380> select<00:05:08.950> the<00:05:09.250> ground<00:05:09.600> hit<00:05:10.600> f8<00:05:10.900> and

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
layers and select the ground hit f8 and

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:17.250 
layers and select the ground hit f8 and
there's<00:05:12.550> our<00:05:12.760> graph<00:05:15.600> ok<00:05:16.600> now<00:05:16.780> that<00:05:16.840> we've<00:05:17.080> got

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
there's our graph ok now that we've got

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:19.170 
there's our graph ok now that we've got
all<00:05:17.290> our<00:05:17.410> objects<00:05:18.190> I'm<00:05:18.700> going<00:05:18.910> to<00:05:18.970> go<00:05:19.060> ahead

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
all our objects I'm going to go ahead

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.900 
all our objects I'm going to go ahead
and<00:05:19.450> unlock<00:05:19.630> all<00:05:20.080> these<00:05:20.290> layers<00:05:20.560> and<00:05:20.920> I'm<00:05:21.760> just

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:21.910 
and unlock all these layers and I'm just

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:23.070 
and unlock all these layers and I'm just
going<00:05:22.030> to<00:05:22.060> move<00:05:22.210> them<00:05:22.390> around<00:05:22.480> to<00:05:22.810> make<00:05:23.050> sure

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
going to move them around to make sure

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:29.220 
going to move them around to make sure
they're<00:05:23.470> in<00:05:23.500> the<00:05:23.710> the<00:05:24.610> proper<00:05:24.970> order<00:05:27.870> so<00:05:28.870> we

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:29.230 
they're in the the proper order so we

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:30.960 
they're in the the proper order so we
can<00:05:29.380> see<00:05:29.530> that<00:05:29.650> the<00:05:29.800> Sun<00:05:30.010> is<00:05:30.160> behind<00:05:30.340> the<00:05:30.640> cloud

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:30.970 
can see that the Sun is behind the cloud

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.090 
can see that the Sun is behind the cloud
here<00:05:31.330> so<00:05:31.720> let's<00:05:32.080> say<00:05:32.260> we<00:05:32.410> wanted<00:05:32.650> the<00:05:32.740> Sun<00:05:32.950> to

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.100 
here so let's say we wanted the Sun to

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.850 
here so let's say we wanted the Sun to
be<00:05:33.220> in<00:05:33.310> front<00:05:33.550> of<00:05:33.700> the<00:05:33.760> cloud<00:05:34.000> we'd<00:05:34.930> select<00:05:35.380> the

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
be in front of the cloud we'd select the

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.660 
be in front of the cloud we'd select the
Sun<00:05:36.130> layer<00:05:36.370> here<00:05:36.850> and<00:05:36.970> we<00:05:37.570> would<00:05:37.690> drag<00:05:38.080> it

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:38.670 
Sun layer here and we would drag it

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.420 
Sun layer here and we would drag it
click<00:05:39.670> and<00:05:39.850> drag<00:05:40.770> above<00:05:41.770> the<00:05:42.010> layer<00:05:42.160> that<00:05:42.370> you

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.430 
click and drag above the layer that you

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.300 
click and drag above the layer that you
want<00:05:42.520> it<00:05:42.730> to<00:05:42.820> be<00:05:42.940> in<00:05:43.120> front<00:05:43.420> of<00:05:43.830> so<00:05:44.830> say<00:05:45.190> we

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
want it to be in front of so say we

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.610 
want it to be in front of so say we
wanted<00:05:45.580> it<00:05:45.820> to<00:05:45.880> be<00:05:46.120> in<00:05:46.210> front<00:05:46.480> of<00:05:46.600> the<00:05:46.690> tree<00:05:46.990> we

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:47.620 
wanted it to be in front of the tree we

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.800 
wanted it to be in front of the tree we
would<00:05:47.740> have<00:05:47.860> to<00:05:47.980> click<00:05:48.220> and<00:05:48.400> drag<00:05:48.660> above<00:05:49.660> the

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810 
would have to click and drag above the

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:52.110 
would have to click and drag above the
tree<00:05:50.190> but<00:05:51.190> that<00:05:51.370> doesn't<00:05:51.580> really<00:05:51.640> make<00:05:51.880> sense

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 
tree but that doesn't really make sense

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.030 
tree but that doesn't really make sense
because<00:05:52.330> the<00:05:52.540> Sun<00:05:52.750> is<00:05:52.900> behind<00:05:53.080> the<00:05:53.560> tree<00:05:53.830> and

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:54.040 
because the Sun is behind the tree and

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:56.120 
because the Sun is behind the tree and
the<00:05:54.160> cloud<00:05:54.370> so<00:05:54.640> we'll<00:05:54.760> drag<00:05:55.000> it<00:05:55.180> down<00:05:55.390> here<00:05:55.420> and

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.130 
the cloud so we'll drag it down here and

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:57.900 
the cloud so we'll drag it down here and
actually<00:05:57.130> it's<00:05:57.220> going<00:05:57.310> to<00:05:57.370> be<00:05:57.430> behind<00:05:57.640> the

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:57.910 
actually it's going to be behind the

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:00.000 
actually it's going to be behind the
ground<00:05:58.180> as<00:05:58.450> well<00:05:58.630> but<00:05:59.110> still<00:05:59.500> in<00:05:59.620> front<00:05:59.770> of<00:05:59.920> the

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.010 
ground as well but still in front of the

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:04.770 
ground as well but still in front of the
sky<00:06:00.280> so<00:06:01.270> that's<00:06:01.780> where<00:06:02.050> it<00:06:02.140> goes<00:06:02.320> right<00:06:02.530> there
