00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.590
 Although the advance schedule scheduled to flow yesterday due to rain and co-star has been missed 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:11.300
 This fluctuation 

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:16.210
 Well this is only from a tripod I think I do not worry about that 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.210
 Straight and good curves are big again 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:26.619
 It is not first from the sky 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:28.630
 The first thing I gave was from Oshima Tofu 1 out to 2 times behind 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.590
 The continuous Qianda Nokura 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:36.180
 Finished a strikeout with a fast ball 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:40.760
 It will come to draw a new Mr. ne Yes this painting also put a runner 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.760
 I think that the early or middle strike line is not hit 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.190
 From 1 ball 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:48.400
 This is an out-course and your lung breathing is fixed. 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:54.950
 It is a strikeout of missed 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:01:00.290
 At that time there was also the feeling that he tumbling win investment in goodbye timely Matsumoto 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:01.620
 If the enemy strikes out continuously strikes for blindness , it is full of stripes 6 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:06.840
 Yes, and came 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.770
 As a point other than Egawa Nishi , there is a 600-dot hit line of the house 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.600
 Hmm 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:14.250

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.990
 Unko 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.490
 I'm very disappointed and the song is overpowering 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:41.360
 Although it was said that, it is because the number 5 ec 20 or so visit will not come out 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:48.270
 Is it 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:51.350
 Though is Now and like hit in the Carp game in Yazawa modern opener did not go out 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.350

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.520

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:32.469
 Whiff the first pitch of the bang that was against it Egani but live I'm players through the three was in seat 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:37.329
 I was able to wait completely with an example, but it felt like something popped 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:41.670
 It is that early white will not strike speed bulletin board from it is 140 km 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:41.670

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.920
 Though it is a player 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:54.519

 Which one is the star Rosen I'm not really good 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.650
 Egawa though we have taken two points to Isoda's or in error 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:12.130
 Somehow added 9 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:13.820
 It is a runner at first base in the rough Mother 2 out while out a runner at the bill 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.080
 There is no treatment-

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.380

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:32.730
 If Mr. Arata and Roche come out of the Luin , it will be that there is a point with a single person. 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.830
 The 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.010
