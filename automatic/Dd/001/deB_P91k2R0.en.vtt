00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.850 
it's not symmetrical so here's my old
filter<00:02:01.439> there<00:02:01.790> but<00:02:02.790> you<00:02:02.880> can<00:02:03.000> see<00:02:03.240> the<00:02:03.860> that

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
filter there but you can see the that

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.760 
filter there but you can see the that
sort<00:02:05.159> of<00:02:05.219> tab<00:02:05.549> that<00:02:06.270> sticks<00:02:06.479> out<00:02:06.780> that<00:02:07.170> is<00:02:07.409> for

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
sort of tab that sticks out that is for

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.830 
sort of tab that sticks out that is for
the<00:02:07.979> far<00:02:08.459> side<00:02:08.759> and<00:02:08.789> you<00:02:09.060> can<00:02:09.209> see<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.539> shape

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
the far side and you can see the shape

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.820 
the far side and you can see the shape
of<00:02:11.150> the<00:02:12.349> shape

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
of the shape

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.820 
of the shape
of<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:15.390> housing<00:02:15.930> bends<00:02:16.200> out<00:02:16.410> a<00:02:16.440> little<00:02:16.650> bit

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
of the housing bends out a little bit

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:17.960 
of the housing bends out a little bit
back<00:02:16.980> there<00:02:17.010> it's<00:02:17.340> kind<00:02:17.490> of<00:02:17.520> hard<00:02:17.670> to<00:02:17.700> see<00:02:17.910> in

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
back there it's kind of hard to see in

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.700 
back there it's kind of hard to see in
the<00:02:18.030> video<00:02:18.120> but<00:02:18.540> anyway<00:02:18.990> it's<00:02:19.290> going<00:02:19.380> to<00:02:19.470> rest

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
the video but anyway it's going to rest

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.060 
the video but anyway it's going to rest
in<00:02:19.950> there<00:02:20.250> just<00:02:21.210> like<00:02:21.360> that<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:21.930> so<00:02:22.920> the

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
in there just like that and so the

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.940 
in there just like that and so the
bottom<00:02:23.400> side<00:02:23.780> that's<00:02:24.780> your<00:02:25.020> that's<00:02:25.800> your

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
bottom side that's your that's your

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.190 
bottom side that's your that's your
dirty<00:02:26.310> air<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:27.030> air<00:02:27.180> from<00:02:27.330> outside<00:02:27.450> comes<00:02:28.050> in

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
dirty air the air from outside comes in

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.410 
dirty air the air from outside comes in
on<00:02:28.320> this<00:02:28.500> clean<00:02:29.460> air<00:02:29.610> comes<00:02:29.820> out<00:02:29.940> on<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.210> top

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
on this clean air comes out on the top

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.810 
on this clean air comes out on the top
and<00:02:30.690> goes<00:02:30.930> into<00:02:31.320> the<00:02:31.440> engine<00:02:31.580> so<00:02:32.580> we'll<00:02:32.700> go

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
and goes into the engine so we'll go

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:43.510 
and goes into the engine so we'll go
ahead<00:02:32.850> and<00:02:33.090> just<00:02:33.360> pop<00:02:33.930> that<00:02:33.990> in<00:02:34.350> there<00:02:38.840> and<00:02:39.890> so

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.950 

all<00:02:44.520> right<00:02:44.730> so<00:02:45.030> that's<00:02:45.150> sitting<00:02:45.570> in<00:02:45.630> there<00:02:45.810> now

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
all right so that's sitting in there now

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.540 
all right so that's sitting in there now
I<00:02:45.990> left<00:02:46.260> one<00:02:46.440> of<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.620> screws<00:02:46.950> in<00:02:47.130> place<00:02:47.370> you

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
I left one of the screws in place you

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.270 
I left one of the screws in place you
can<00:02:47.700> see<00:02:47.850> what<00:02:47.940> that<00:02:47.970> looks<00:02:48.120> like<00:02:48.980> all<00:02:49.980> right

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
can see what that looks like all right

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.150 
can see what that looks like all right
and<00:02:50.880> there's<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.360> inside<00:02:51.810> of<00:02:52.050> the<00:02:52.230> housing<00:02:53.040> so

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
and there's the inside of the housing so

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.300 
and there's the inside of the housing so
I'm<00:02:53.250> going<00:02:53.370> to<00:02:53.430> go<00:02:53.520> ahead<00:02:53.610> and<00:02:54.980> put<00:02:55.980> this<00:02:56.100> back
