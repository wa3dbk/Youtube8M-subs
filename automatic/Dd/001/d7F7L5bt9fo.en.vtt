00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.100 
pay for what he has done so this means
that<00:01:35.159> ever<00:01:35.460> since<00:01:35.790> ascension<00:01:36.390> Takeo<00:01:36.840> has<00:01:36.960> been

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
that ever since ascension Takeo has been

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.780 
that ever since ascension Takeo has been
starting<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.560> catch<00:01:37.770> on<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.100> what<00:01:38.159> actually

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
starting to catch on to what actually

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.490 
starting to catch on to what actually
happened<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:39.240> him<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:40.020> Richthofen

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
happened to him and that Richthofen

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.780 
happened to him and that Richthofen
isn't<00:01:40.829> such<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.070> good<00:01:41.369> guy

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
isn't such a good guy

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.999 
isn't such a good guy
I'm<00:01:41.939> not<00:01:42.360> exactly<00:01:42.689> sure<00:01:42.930> how<00:01:43.350> many<00:01:43.409> maps<00:01:43.740> are

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
I'm not exactly sure how many maps are

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.920 
I'm not exactly sure how many maps are
in<00:01:44.159> between<00:01:44.310> Ascension<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.060> Moon<00:01:45.270> now<00:01:45.720> but<00:01:45.840> if

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
in between Ascension and Moon now but if

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.840 
in between Ascension and Moon now but if
Tokyo<00:01:46.290> caught<00:01:46.560> on<00:01:46.740> this<00:01:46.979> means<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.460> he's<00:01:47.640> not

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
Tokyo caught on this means that he's not

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.730 
Tokyo caught on this means that he's not
so<00:01:48.030> clueless<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.750> he<00:01:49.140> actually<00:01:49.560> paid

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
so clueless and he actually paid

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.440 
so clueless and he actually paid
attention<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.280> how<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.430> teleporters<00:01:51.149> all<00:01:51.360> the

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
attention to how the teleporters all the

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.960 
attention to how the teleporters all the
devices<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.140> how<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.740> actual<00:01:53.280> zombies<00:01:53.700> work

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
devices and how the actual zombies work

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.850 
devices and how the actual zombies work
so<00:01:54.509> hopefully<00:01:54.869> now<00:01:55.049> you<00:01:55.110> realize<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:55.560> he

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
so hopefully now you realize that he

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.319 
so hopefully now you realize that he
actually<00:01:55.890> knows<00:01:56.430> a<00:01:56.460> lot<00:01:56.759> more<00:01:57.060> than<00:01:57.240> we

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
actually knows a lot more than we

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.090 
actually knows a lot more than we
thought<00:01:57.360> he<00:01:57.719> did<00:01:57.930> so<00:01:58.409> at<00:01:58.530> moon<00:01:58.680> we<00:01:58.860> know<00:01:58.950> that

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
thought he did so at moon we know that

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.800 
thought he did so at moon we know that
Richtofen<00:01:59.579> switched<00:01:59.880> souls<00:02:00.119> with<00:02:00.329> Samantha

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
Richtofen switched souls with Samantha

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.300 
Richtofen switched souls with Samantha
and<00:02:00.960> now<00:02:01.049> he's<00:02:01.200> in<00:02:01.350> control<00:02:01.619> of<00:02:01.740> their<00:02:01.979> zombies

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
and now he's in control of their zombies

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.520 
and now he's in control of their zombies
and<00:02:02.579> now<00:02:02.729> Tokyo<00:02:03.210> has<00:02:03.390> always<00:02:03.600> hidden<00:02:03.990> his<00:02:04.320> hate

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
and now Tokyo has always hidden his hate

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.350 
and now Tokyo has always hidden his hate
for<00:02:04.560> Richthofen<00:02:05.280> um<00:02:05.520> he<00:02:05.700> didn't<00:02:05.969> really<00:02:06.060> want

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
for Richthofen um he didn't really want

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.210 
for Richthofen um he didn't really want
Richthofen<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:07.020> realize<00:02:07.409> that<00:02:07.619> he<00:02:07.829> knew<00:02:08.039> what

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
Richthofen to realize that he knew what

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.740
