using We Fools this believe it or not
with<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.490> first<00:00:26.820> time<00:00:27.090> I've<00:00:27.420> played<00:00:27.720> one<00:00:27.900> flag

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
with a first time I've played one flag

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.580 
with a first time I've played one flag
CTF<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:29.099> I<00:00:29.789> managed<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.390> get<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.840> nuclear<00:00:31.050> a

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
CTF and I managed to get a nuclear a

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.280 
CTF and I managed to get a nuclear a
couple<00:00:32.399> of<00:00:32.460> swarms<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:35.270> yeah<00:00:36.270> I<00:00:36.630> think<00:00:36.960> that's

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
couple of swarms and yeah I think that's

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.869 
couple of swarms and yeah I think that's
that<00:00:37.530> but<00:00:38.070> come<00:00:38.670> on<00:00:39.170> the<00:00:40.170> way<00:00:40.379> one<00:00:41.219> flag<00:00:41.550> CTF

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
that but come on the way one flag CTF

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.229 
that but come on the way one flag CTF
works<00:00:42.480> is<00:00:43.100> there's<00:00:44.100> one<00:00:44.280> flag<00:00:44.579> in<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:44.969> middle

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
works is there's one flag in the middle

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.200 
works is there's one flag in the middle
and<00:00:45.420> you<00:00:46.070> have<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.219> take<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.430> flag<00:00:47.789> from<00:00:48.090> the

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
and you have to take a flag from the

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.900 
and you have to take a flag from the
middle<00:00:48.480> toward<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.230> any<00:00:49.379> base<00:00:49.680> get<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.610> 5

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
middle toward to any base get a 5

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
take the flag from the enemy base and

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.479 
take the flag from the enemy base and
take<00:00:59.879> it<00:01:00.030> all<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.180> way<00:01:00.270> back<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.660> yours<00:01:01.489> this

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
take it all the way back to yours this

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.080 
take it all the way back to yours this
is<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:03.090> think<00:01:03.359> it's<00:01:03.870> like<00:01:04.080> more<00:01:04.769> fast-paced<00:01:05.220> for

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
is I think it's like more fast-paced for

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.310 
is I think it's like more fast-paced for
some<00:01:06.299> reason<00:01:06.630> like<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:07.020> don't<00:01:07.170> get<00:01:07.290> a

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
some reason like you don't get a

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.920 
some reason like you don't get a
standoff<00:01:07.860> so<00:01:08.130> they<00:01:08.310> still<00:01:09.000> mates<00:01:09.270> what<00:01:09.510> both

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
standoff so they still mates what both

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.050 
standoff so they still mates what both
team<00:01:10.229> is<00:01:10.350> pull<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.650> flags<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.790> then<00:01:11.909> it's

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
team is pull the flags and then it's

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.260 
team is pull the flags and then it's
just<00:01:12.150> like<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.799> TDM<00:01:13.799> almost<00:01:14.189> like<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.729> tactical

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
just like a TDM almost like a tactical

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.870 
just like a TDM almost like a tactical
TDM<00:01:15.720> because<00:01:16.189> you<00:01:17.189> have<00:01:17.340> one<00:01:17.549> point<00:01:17.820> of

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
TDM because you have one point of

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:18.770 
TDM because you have one point of
setting<00:01:18.060> back<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.479> have<00:01:18.540> one<00:01:18.750> player

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
setting back you have one player

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.690 
setting back you have one player
defending<00:01:19.380> on<00:01:19.500> Tim<00:01:19.650> defended<00:01:20.220> actually<00:01:20.580> yeah

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
defending on Tim defended actually yeah

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.749 
defending on Tim defended actually yeah
I<00:01:20.939> think<00:01:21.780> it's<00:01:21.900> like<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.259> but<00:01:23.220> it's<00:01:23.549> just

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
I think it's like that but it's just

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.070 
I think it's like that but it's just
basically<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.119> killed<00:01:24.360> one<00:01:24.509> match<00:01:24.659> when<00:01:25.049> I

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
basically I killed one match when I

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.600 
basically I killed one match when I
don't<00:01:25.290> steal<00:01:25.439> me<00:01:25.619> so<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.100> can<00:01:26.280> get<00:01:26.400> with

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
don't steal me so you can get with

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.460 
don't steal me so you can get with
streaks<00:01:26.939> so<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:27.659> can<00:01:27.840> file<00:01:28.080> them<00:01:28.229> at<00:01:28.350> your

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
streaks so you can file them at your

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.990 
streaks so you can file them at your
opponents<00:01:28.890> oh<00:01:29.720> but<00:01:30.720> anyway<00:01:30.930> him<00:01:31.340> I've<00:01:32.340> been

you have done it a former practical V&amp;P

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.560 
you have done it a former practical V&amp;P
I<00:02:04.159> think<00:02:05.159> that<00:02:05.219> was<00:02:05.310> always<00:02:05.909> able<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.270> do<00:02:06.450> it

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
I think that was always able to do it

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.270 
I think that was always able to do it
from<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.780> practical<00:02:07.020> cause<00:02:07.530> I<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.740> sinkhole

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
from a practical cause I the sinkhole

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.680 
from a practical cause I the sinkhole
was<00:02:08.489> good<00:02:09.300> slaughters<00:02:10.110> syndrome

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
was good slaughters syndrome

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.530 
was good slaughters syndrome
