00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:11.490
 I think the project has such crap 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:22.769
 I feel this unpretentiousness that for me has 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:25.460
 a light spirit to plastic artist 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.590
 30 mobile opportunity this year this property 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:33.030
 and make an office that could be 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.700
 divided into two would be his and the woman's 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.190
 theoretically throughout development 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.530
 he saw that he would not go to the office 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.230
 and the opportunity of this company appeared 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.870
 publisher is there to be their headquarters 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.710
 structural masonry house 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.600
 and as it did not have a rigid program 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.090
 We only have two hours to go. 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.879
 free plants or as an agent of a 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.480
 cleaner in the house practically 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.859
 total only the facades and the side 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.830
 protracted 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.590
 we created a circulation area 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:08.159
 funny and that independence 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.640
 interdependence between the two floors 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.310
 and the circulation of access to the property 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.030
 in this opening of the faÃ§ade people 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:22.220
 created this great element that is 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.220
 distant from concrete making the ladder 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.869
 concrete assistant has two 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.180
 roles for making their own 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.970
 house that we took structurally 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:38.220
 also because we have done against the 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:40.799
 pillars with their own lateral feathers 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.159
 of the shelves they are even structural 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:47.909
 then this shelf solution along with 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:52.439
 a metal beam does all this function 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:54.750
 bring them inside be a library 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:58.350
 she is the transparency behind this 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.479
 the sector is what is a 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.030
 public area of the office that is the 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.610
 entrance to the canopy 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.960
 bathrooms of a more reserved area than 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.960
 the work room is not 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:16.870
 chan roof four waters and an eave is 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.610
 operating Japan was already ruined was 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.430
 an old wooden liberal had 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.380
 there are roof problems and people 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.690
 decided to do this homework 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.540
 so instead of keeping the roof four 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:32.200
 The roof is now two waters and the 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:36.160
 facade she has this profile there you 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:39.580
 really see the profile of the drawing 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.350
 from the roof of justice or the tiles 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.209
 had structure reinforced the structure 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.130
 reinforced because they were 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.989
 leaning on the walls as we 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.120
 removed the walls and need to 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:52.810
 a little the roof structure and 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:55.270
 We exchange tiles for new material, right? 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.820
 there would be metal with the sandwich with the 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.250
 thermoacoustic insulation that also 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:06.940
 as a reflector of light that you like 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:11.350
 to use direct health you have this 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:13.090
 concrete bridge that connects the ladder to 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.390
 bathrooms on the floor line is 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.640
 concrete falaschi tower 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:22.120
 bathrooms that are concrete the rings of 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:25.150
 facade that are instant concrete 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.790
 we have concrete coating 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.470
 floor that is the great elite or escape 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.500
 and then we have these two areas 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.840
 the front at the back where the 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.320
 people have hail and more are the 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.660
 original materials of the house and the glass it 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:44.230
 is made not to appear but it does 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:48.070
 part is naturally the element and 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:51.330
 metal that makes each catwalk connects 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:56.350
 these concrete elements 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:58.840
 very happy so client moment work 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.820
 reform the front door to door 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.700
 pantograph in the first moment he 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.740
 said for a photograph in china 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.140
 Let's do a photographic job and 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.210
 then in sequence and opened a 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.610
 photographic exhibition and I did not 

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:16.180
 It's all right, let's go there and it's an element. 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:18.820
 his right characteristic for only he could 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.330
 put that place in the then was very 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.330
 cool and
