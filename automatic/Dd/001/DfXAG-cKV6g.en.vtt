00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:16.049
 let's paint another boré 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:21.619
 so let's go in with a yellow one 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.619
 the gold in it whole 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:33.350
 vegetables are always bigger than fruits 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.300
 so we use a bigger brush but 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:39.800
 in the water 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:44.800
 18 10 making the contour loads well 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:48.250
 with ink comes by making the year 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.250
 next 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:01:05.840
 ink without missing a single 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:15.080
 little piece puts this risk here he has to 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:33.649
 pumpkin onion the carrot that we already 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:50.200
 we tried in the other video when love is 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:55.690
 faster and became quite yellow 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.690
 by law that the risk of onion 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:04.580
 depositing the fifth passing in all 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:10.099
 place looking to see if there is no shortage 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:15.050
 no little pumpkin is as it were 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:17.420
 painting gives a hand to hit because they are the 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.900
 same colors only with loads 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.150
 different colors of ink are 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.650
 hopscotch 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:28.340
 So now I've been working with a 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:31.840
 red remembering that red and 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.840
 yellow equal to the farm 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.530
 so I've been doing the outline 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:45.860
 I'm brushing circles to go to 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:49.870
 street amapá passes to pass this 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.870
 red transfer to yellow 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:00.170
 always putting the ink on the border is 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:14.540
 much easier for you to work without 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:26.150
 spot the shift and I've been bringing this 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:30.069
 here in this giant hue all 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.069
 the pumpkins are like this 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.830
 you choose you choose the side that 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.560
 you want to work 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:42.670
 the color you choose the side you want 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.670
 work light 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:51.910
 then I made the outline deposited the ink 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:57.010
 internet and well doing the same thing 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:57.010
 brushing brush brushing brush 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:07.750
 rubbing the brush to see if it does not 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:07.750
 It's telling Tim there's no corner. 

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:16.370
 now here without a brush without anything 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:21.520
 Here at the best I want the light so I 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:26.560
 I'm going to take 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:31.570
 boller donates a little of this 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.570
 red yellow 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:40.730
 and to finish of only depositing ink 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:45.560
 that the light with the brush a 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:49.460
 little lower is the stalk of exceter 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:54.260
 and can put a little bit of 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:58.280
 white sé is also beautiful for you 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:00.730
 make this control mack the only one 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.730
 a little 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:13.889
 wen passadinho well passadinha also 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:19.529
 you can pick up the sepe to work a little 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:22.889
 so that the pumpkin gives a 

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:29.159
 cleaned the brush made the conditions 

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:34.460
 here brushes the brush to apply a 

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:34.460
 thinner stroke more defined 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:43.650
 not to be boring kiss would only take 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:43.650
