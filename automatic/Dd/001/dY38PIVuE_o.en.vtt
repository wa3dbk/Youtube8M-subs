 now we're going to put the basil 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:02:02.270
 but in an exceptional one of us we are going 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:05.240
 put salt and black pepper 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:09.769
 the rest of the English sauce 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:14.450
 Let's leave the sugar last, let's go. 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:15.980
 knock we hit with another two minutes 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.220
 now we'll put a 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:23.420
 sugar coffee spoon to take racy 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:27.290
 since the tomato beat the sampa of a 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.570
 lightly mixed and if that extract 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.579
 of tomatoes or tomato sauce I do not know how 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:35.209
 you call in your region 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:38.630
 fresh trigger on time 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:40.549
 now we're going to carry the fire on fire 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.430
 low in a pan 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:47.060
 We're going to dump this mix that we 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:49.160
 we hit the blender a lot of attention 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.400
 in the low fire of people 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:58.730
 if it does not burn now we'll leave 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:03:00.680
 here clearing the face for 30 minutes 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.989
 We will not keep stirring the whole time. 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.880
 They will not be around. 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.730
 once in a while we think it is 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.579
 telling us that we got the glass of 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.889
 water that we leave reserved for us 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:15.650
 let's catch up 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:18.680
 now they need water there is here a 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.530
 10 minutes or so and it's drying 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.519
 Then we'll see if you need water. 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:27.440
 I'm not going to show you 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:30.430
 Let's leave it half covered like this in case 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:34.299
 of sneezing in ten minutes 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:37.030
 look for a fluff he has to stay 30 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:40.060
 minutes to be able to heal the face of 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.819
 ingredients where he knows likes 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.909
 He can burn at rest. 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:52.319
 I like to do it without putting a 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:55.480
 little water a little daggers still 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:58.139
 there are several recipes 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:01.150
 several people each do something 

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:04.629
 I learned this way with my mother. 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:08.829
 for my grandmother she had in the yard 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:11.349
 harvested automatic and small was made 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:14.919
 sauce we did not find with sauce 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:19.799
 soon to be analyzed, it was not only 

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:24.460
 so the offer at home and she did so 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:27.460
 It's 30 minutes even fire is gone before 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.780
 it begins to thicken much there to 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:31.780
 do not burn 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.910
 We're dripping water here, people already 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.349
 30 minutes completed our cake 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:39.729
 it's here on fire 

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:42.639
 When are you going to do this? 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:44.979
 here is the moment of proof 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:47.979
 If you need more seasoning, you 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:50.639
 place if not I here in my case not 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:54.690
 I'll put more knows it 's already great 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:54.690
 Let's disconnect the liner. 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.400
 Now we're going to turn out the hypothesis. 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:09.060
 because we can freeze this sauce 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:12.699
