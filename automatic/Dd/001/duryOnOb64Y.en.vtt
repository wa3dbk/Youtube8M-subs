in fact when I was trying to come up

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.060 
in fact when I was trying to come up
with<00:00:50.820> my<00:00:51.090> youtube<00:00:51.510> name<00:00:51.539> I<00:00:52.289> really<00:00:52.770> thought

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
with my youtube name I really thought

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.209 
with my youtube name I really thought
about<00:00:53.129> using<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.300> name<00:00:54.600> like<00:00:54.840> Brickyard<00:00:55.590> or

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
about using a name like Brickyard or

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.959 
about using a name like Brickyard or
that<00:00:56.520> name<00:00:57.480> for<00:00:57.840> my<00:00:57.960> store<00:00:58.379> on<00:00:59.340> my<00:00:59.520> break<00:00:59.730> link

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
that name for my store on my break link

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.689 
that name for my store on my break link
store<00:01:00.270> but<00:01:01.050> I<00:01:01.710> think<00:01:02.219> there<00:01:02.309> were<00:01:02.399> some<00:01:02.520> other

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
store but I think there were some other

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.090 
store but I think there were some other
people<00:01:03.059> that<00:01:03.270> had<00:01:03.930> been<00:01:04.049> using<00:01:04.260> a<00:01:04.650> similar

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
people that had been using a similar

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.890 
people that had been using a similar
name<00:01:05.309> so<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:05.700> had<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.119> Kimball<00:01:06.390> for<00:01:06.540> something

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
name so I had to Kimball for something

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.380 
name so I had to Kimball for something
unique<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.590> nobody<00:01:08.159> else<00:01:08.520> is<00:01:08.729> using<00:01:08.970> and

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
unique that nobody else is using and

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.840 
unique that nobody else is using and
that's<00:01:09.450> why<00:01:09.659> I<00:01:09.689> came<00:01:09.840> up<00:01:10.020> with<00:01:10.080> free<00:01:10.439> kazar<00:01:10.850> but

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.320 
that's why I came up with free kazar but
I<00:01:11.880> really<00:01:12.600> like<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:13.380> name<00:01:13.590> Brickyard<00:01:14.400> but

then if this is spring-loaded and this
we're<00:02:40.620> scooping<00:02:40.920> up<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.340> bricks<00:02:41.930> let<00:02:42.930> me<00:02:42.989> show

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
we're scooping up the bricks let me show

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.040 
we're scooping up the bricks let me show
you<00:02:43.320> that<00:02:43.790> the<00:02:44.790> bricks<00:02:45.090> they<00:02:45.540> give<00:02:45.750> you<00:02:45.900> our

little<00:03:02.820> vehicle<00:03:03.980> man<00:03:05.030> this<00:03:06.030> is<00:03:06.239> for<00:03:06.420> scooping

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
little vehicle man this is for scooping

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.979 
little vehicle man this is for scooping
the<00:03:06.930> bricks<00:03:07.140> off<00:03:07.350> of<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.590> ground<00:03:08.840> just<00:03:09.840> a

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
the bricks off of the ground just a

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.060 
the bricks off of the ground just a
little<00:03:10.019> front-end<00:03:10.650> loader<00:03:11.060> like<00:03:12.060> so<00:03:12.890> I'm<00:03:13.890> not

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
little front-end loader like so I'm not

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.400 
little front-end loader like so I'm not
sure<00:03:14.280> what<00:03:14.489> the<00:03:14.610> procedure<00:03:15.030> is<00:03:15.209> here<00:03:16.400> but<00:03:17.400> um

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410

and load the contents all right

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.289 
and load the contents all right
see<00:04:17.910> this<00:04:18.090> piece<00:04:18.359> came<00:04:18.630> off<00:04:18.840> here<00:04:20.150> all<00:04:21.150> right

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
see this piece came off here all right

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:24.680 
see this piece came off here all right
now<00:04:21.570> the<00:04:21.630> coolest<00:04:21.959> part<00:04:22.380> is<00:04:22.530> the<00:04:23.520> pulley<00:04:23.790> or

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
now the coolest part is the pulley or

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.050 
now the coolest part is the pulley or
the<00:04:24.810> conveyor<00:04:25.110> belt<00:04:25.200> not<00:04:25.530> pulleys<00:04:26.060> conveyor

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
the conveyor belt not pulleys conveyor

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.220 
the conveyor belt not pulleys conveyor
belt<00:04:27.780> and<00:04:29.150> this<00:04:30.150> is<00:04:30.390> in<00:04:30.570> a<00:04:30.870> couple<00:04:31.169> of

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
belt and this is in a couple of

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.490 
belt and this is in a couple of
different<00:04:31.350> sets<00:04:31.770> in<00:04:32.010> red<00:04:32.220> it's<00:04:32.490> also<00:04:32.880> in

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
different sets in red it's also in

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.909 
different sets in red it's also in
yellow<00:04:34.500> and<00:04:35.340> it<00:04:35.430> looks<00:04:35.610> like<00:04:35.669> this<00:04:36.000> one<00:04:36.240> is

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
yellow and it looks like this one is

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:48.409 
yellow and it looks like this one is
kind<00:04:37.919> of<00:04:37.950> lost<00:04:38.130> its<00:04:38.400> traction<00:04:42.500> all<00:04:43.500> right<00:04:47.419> well

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
kind of lost its traction all right well

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:51.380 
kind of lost its traction all right well
I<00:04:48.690> guess<00:04:48.930> my<00:04:49.140> conveyor<00:04:50.010> is<00:04:50.280> just<00:04:50.580> old<00:04:50.940> and<00:04:51.210> worn

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:51.390 
I guess my conveyor is just old and worn

that's<00:05:59.460> how<00:05:59.610> the<00:05:59.669> conveyer<00:06:00.090> works<00:06:02.300> so<00:06:03.300> that's

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:03.450 
that's how the conveyer works so that's

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:05.390 
that's how the conveyer works so that's
the<00:06:03.660> back<00:06:03.840> entrance<00:06:04.140> that<00:06:04.560> one<00:06:04.800> driveway

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 
the back entrance that one driveway

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.950 
the back entrance that one driveway
there<00:06:05.669> and<00:06:06.000> then<00:06:06.120> you<00:06:06.210> get<00:06:06.330> two<00:06:06.660> driveways

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
there and then you get two driveways

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.320 
there and then you get two driveways
over<00:06:07.440> here<00:06:07.650> so<00:06:07.800> this<00:06:07.950> plate<00:06:08.220> is<00:06:08.460> unique<00:06:08.850> to<00:06:09.180> the
