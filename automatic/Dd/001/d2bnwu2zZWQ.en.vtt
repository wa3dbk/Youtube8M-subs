00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.380
 welcome everyone to the new video tutorials on 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.170
 Communication Alexey Kuzmichyov 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.420
 as you remember last month i am with you 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.490
 began to disassemble the most simple and 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:25.490
 interesting photo effects to process 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.619
 your pictures and today we have the next 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.050
 a lesson from this topic we will be with you 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.180
 disassemble effect called earlybird 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.000
 This effect allows to achieve 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.040
 beautiful yellow brown shades on 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.960
 Photo 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.570
 so I chose to work here 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.239
 this snapshot you can take any 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.940
 photograph and try to do the same 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.300
 action that I and so let's start 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.469
 the first thing you and I need 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.749
 create a correction layer map 

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:55.820
 gradient 

00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:58.070
 bang on a circle here here and 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.370
 select the adjustment layer map 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.620
 gradient here click on the scale and 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.980
 choose the standard gradient from 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.560
 purple to orange so we press 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.409
 ok key 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.540
 make sure you have shadows 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:17.930
 purple shades and the light was orange 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.740
 if you have the opposite, just put 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.890
 tick 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.140
 the inversion here is so close given 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.090
 adjustment layer and change the mode 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:30.390
 overlay multiplication 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:34.229
 lower the layer opacity to 20 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.200
 percent about and we should 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.229
 come here so easy 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:42.390
 purple hue on our shots further 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.360
 let's create another corrective 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.909
 layer click here choose brightness 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:54.619
 contrast we increase the brightness 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:57.539
 images by about 15 or 20 even 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.420
 also increase the contrast by about 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:02.340
 up to 30 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:06.360
 in this way we close this 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.799
 adjustment layer and create 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.039
 adjustment layer fill 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:16.079
 or the color at the top, we are 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:23.610
 click here and in the window where we need 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:27.870
 set the color number we write fd f1 d5 this 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:30.799
 light beige click ok and mode 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.480
 overlay also put on multiplication 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:36.180
 this layer will help us give more 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.569
 more warm tones on our snapshot as 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.069
 see before and after 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.769
 next step create another 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.280
 adjustment layer this time it is 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.870
 we will 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:51.290
 select a level and clarify a little 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:56.160
 our picture drag the middle slider 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:03:00.510
 slightly left to about 1 and 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:04.769
 30 I think that's how we go now in 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:07.380
 red channel here and slightly sweep in 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:11.209
 bottom scale to the right to add 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:14.790
 a little red on the photo 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:17.849
 approximately to a value of 15 like this 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:21.180
 close this corrective way 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:22.799
 layer then press shift 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.989
 kontrol alt e 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.239
 to create a combined copy of all 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.919
 our layers 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:31.530
 so we have it at the top 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:34.079
 you and I need to discolor it 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.650
 press shift control you 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:39.120
 either this can be done through point 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:43.349
 image correction and select here 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:47.060
 point to discolor yes so change mode 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:50.040
 overlaying this layer on soft light and 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:53.969
 lower the transparency to about 50 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:56.730
 percent like this so we 

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:59.489
 created even more contrast on 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.620
 photos further to highlight 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.849
 model on our snapshots I want to add 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.340
 small vignette 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:06.829
 for this we will use the new 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.980
 empty layer 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:15.260
 click here and fill with black 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:17.940
 this layer press alt del so now 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:22.430
 add a mask to this layer, click 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:25.200
 here and select the gradient tool 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:28.710
 gradient style set radial and 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:32.340
 set the color to black and white like this 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:35.539
 now choose the mask of the top 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.169
 layer and middle like this 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:40.380
 fill this mask 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:43.320
 gradients tax i have inversion enabled 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:48.060
 let's turn it off and repeat the same 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:52.500
 most now because we need to lower 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:55.590
 Vignette transparency to about 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.539
 seventy percent you can put 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.560
 here another value depending on 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:00.360
 your photo 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.180
 that is, what effect do you have more 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.669
 like no tags 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:08.570
 well and now let's soften a little 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:11.940
 we will use shadows for this 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:15.690
 exposure adjustment layer choose 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:20.279
 him and slightly drag the slider shift 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:21.919
 right to about zero integer 

00:05:20.279 --> 00:05:25.550
 zero 083 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:25.550
 like this 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:31.199
 as you can see on the photo appeared such 

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:33.240
 interesting haze and the final step 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:35.280
 You can slightly increase the sharpness on 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.560
 photos for this to us first 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.880
 need to create a merged copy 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.680
 all our layers 

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:45.240
 Press the shift kontrol alt and 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:49.410
 now go to filter gain 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:51.590
 sharpness contour sharpness depending 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:55.740
 from your photo we set up here 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:57.389
 value the larger you have the size of your 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.340
 steam to those accordingly you need 

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:01.349
 put more radius 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:05.460
 In this case, I have the best settings 

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:09.419
 this is an effect of 150 percent and a radius of 3 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:10.470
 pixel press ok and here is our 

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:13.470
 final result 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:15.930
 let's combine all the resulting layers 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:19.139
 in a separate group and see what 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:21.470
 It turned out and so here is a photo that 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:24.810
 we had a very early video tutorial and 

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:27.080
 this is what we achieved in the process 

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.080
 processing
