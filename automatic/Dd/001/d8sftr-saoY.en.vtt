about the changes to the beagle it now

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.319 
about the changes to the beagle it now
has<00:00:37.500> a<00:00:37.530> longer<00:00:37.920> range<00:00:38.100> we've<00:00:38.790> tested<00:00:39.000> whether

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
has a longer range we've tested whether

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.270 
has a longer range we've tested whether
this<00:00:39.540> means<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:40.050> long<00:00:40.200> range<00:00:40.440> one<00:00:40.739> beaks<00:00:41.010> are

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
this means the long range one beaks are

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.160 
this means the long range one beaks are
back<00:00:41.610> if<00:00:42.270> you<00:00:42.450> look<00:00:42.600> back<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.989> previous

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
the exact same positions and a place to

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.369 
the exact same positions and a place to
say<00:00:47.730> that<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.059> head<00:00:48.210> shots<00:00:48.450> with<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.690> beagle<00:00:49.170> at

long<00:00:49.680> range<00:00:49.980> will<00:00:50.550> result<00:00:51.000> in<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.510> death<00:00:53.629> an

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
long range will result in a death an

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.299 
long range will result in a death an
interesting<00:00:55.410> thing<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:55.620> we<00:00:55.860> found<00:00:56.070> was<00:00:56.219> that

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
interesting thing that we found was that

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.520 
interesting thing that we found was that
extremely<00:00:57.000> long<00:00:57.329> ranges<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.989> deagle<00:00:58.350> will

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
extremely long ranges the deagle will

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.069 
extremely long ranges the deagle will
not<00:00:58.739> be<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:58.949> one-shot<00:00:59.219> kill<00:00:59.809> instead<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:00.899> leaves

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
not be a one-shot kill instead it leaves

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.439 
not be a one-shot kill instead it leaves
them<00:01:01.289> on<00:01:01.410> very<00:01:01.649> low<00:01:01.829> HP<00:01:02.070> but<00:01:02.550> alive<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.000> fight

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
them on very low HP but alive to fight

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.310

as far as I know the shots for the
beagle<00:01:06.390> are<00:01:06.479> still<00:01:06.689> really<00:01:07.049> random<00:01:07.290> when<00:01:07.650> you

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
beagle are still really random when you

spam it in order to be accurate you have

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.420 
spam it in order to be accurate you have
to<00:01:09.869> wait<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.049> little<00:01:10.260> bit<00:01:10.409> for<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.799> recoil<00:01:11.220> to

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
to wait a little bit for the recoil to

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.850 
to wait a little bit for the recoil to
reset<00:01:11.820> I'm<00:01:12.689> still<00:01:12.930> not<00:01:13.049> sure<00:01:13.140> that<00:01:13.380> this<00:01:13.590> patch
