00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
to how to make the 3 x 4 x 5 cubic a

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.609 
to how to make the 3 x 4 x 5 cubic a
house<00:00:26.480> so<00:00:27.480> make<00:00:27.689> this<00:00:27.869> you're<00:00:28.199> going<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.410> need

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
house so make this you're going to need

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:37.750 
house so make this you're going to need
three<00:00:29.460> Rubik's<00:00:29.970> cubes<00:00:33.650> and<00:00:35.449> all<00:00:36.449> it<00:00:36.809> is<00:00:36.930> is<00:00:37.229> a

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
three Rubik's cubes and all it is is a

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:50.420 
three Rubik's cubes and all it is is a
siamese<00:00:38.760> cube<00:00:39.680> connected<00:00:40.680> in<00:00:40.890> this<00:00:41.460> way<00:00:49.430> all

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
siamese cube connected in this way all

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.390 
siamese cube connected in this way all
you<00:00:50.580> gotta<00:00:50.760> do<00:00:51.030> is<00:00:51.059> um<00:00:51.739> just<00:00:52.739> put<00:00:52.920> some<00:00:53.159> glue

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:53.400 
you gotta do is um just put some glue

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.509 
you gotta do is um just put some glue
right<00:00:53.640> here<00:00:53.940> and<00:00:54.589> some<00:00:55.589> glue<00:00:55.799> right<00:00:55.979> here<00:00:56.250> and

00:00:56.509 --> 00:00:56.519 
right here and some glue right here and

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:03.020 
right here and some glue right here and
just<00:00:58.460> put<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.489> together<00:00:59.640> like<00:00:59.970> that<00:01:01.820> so<00:01:02.820> that's

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
just put it together like that so that's

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.929 
just put it together like that so that's
what<00:01:03.180> you<00:01:03.239> do<00:01:03.390> with<00:01:03.479> two<00:01:03.750> of<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.140> cubes<00:01:04.939> and

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
what you do with two of the cubes and

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.640 
what you do with two of the cubes and
remember<00:01:06.360> you<00:01:06.450> have<00:01:06.479> some<00:01:06.810> extra<00:01:06.990> parts<00:01:07.500> you

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
remember you have some extra parts you

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.030 
remember you have some extra parts you
could<00:01:07.830> use<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.640> make<00:01:08.790> these<00:01:08.940> extended<00:01:09.420> layers

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
could use to make these extended layers

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.590 
could use to make these extended layers
so<00:01:11.040> obviously<00:01:11.640> I<00:01:11.730> just<00:01:12.120> add<00:01:12.240> these<00:01:12.450> are

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
so obviously I just add these are

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.790 
so obviously I just add these are
extended<00:01:13.230> layers<00:01:14.060> and<00:01:15.060> what<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:15.660> do<00:01:15.840> is<00:01:15.870> are

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:16.800 
extended layers and what you do is are

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.590 
extended layers and what you do is are
you<00:01:16.860> gonna<00:01:17.070> do<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.400> just<00:01:17.550> put<00:01:17.760> this<00:01:17.910> one<00:01:18.180> it

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
you gonna do is just put this one it

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.230 
you gonna do is just put this one it
goes<00:01:18.720> here<00:01:19.050> and<00:01:19.310> put<00:01:20.310> right<00:01:20.520> there<00:01:20.730> and<00:01:20.970> just

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
goes here and put right there and just

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.210 
goes here and put right there and just
like<00:01:21.390> do<00:01:21.540> this<00:01:21.660> for<00:01:21.870> each<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:22.140> them<00:01:22.260> and<00:01:22.500> for

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
like do this for each of them and for

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.320 
like do this for each of them and for
the<00:01:23.340> middle<00:01:23.640> one<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:24.480> could<00:01:24.660> just<00:01:24.690> like<00:01:25.220> use

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
the middle one you could just like use

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.450 
the middle one you could just like use
one<00:01:27.330> of<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.510> ones<00:01:27.720> you've<00:01:27.960> taken<00:01:28.200> off<00:01:28.470> so<00:01:29.190> you

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
one of the ones you've taken off so you

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.950 
one of the ones you've taken off so you
can<00:01:29.580> just<00:01:29.640> like<00:01:29.880> figure<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.330> out<00:01:30.480> it's<00:01:30.750> really

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
can just like figure it out it's really

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.060 
can just like figure it out it's really
easy<00:01:31.110> it's<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.480> mean<00:01:33.480> it's<00:01:33.770> kind<00:01:34.770> of<00:01:34.800> hard<00:01:34.980> to

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
easy it's I mean it's kind of hard to

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.520 
easy it's I mean it's kind of hard to
explain<00:01:35.370> something<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.200> you'll<00:01:37.200> figure<00:01:37.440> out

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
explain something that you'll figure out

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.280 
explain something that you'll figure out
easily<00:01:38.400> I<00:01:39.050> don't<00:01:40.050> know<00:01:40.110> if<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:40.260> makes<00:01:40.440> sense<00:01:40.590> I

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
easily I don't know if it makes sense I

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.469 
easily I don't know if it makes sense I
don't<00:01:43.290> know<00:01:44.840> okay<00:01:45.840> after<00:01:46.230> gluing<00:01:46.500> those<00:01:46.740> on

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
don't know okay after gluing those on

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:53.750 
don't know okay after gluing those on
there<00:01:48.479> should<00:01:48.720> be<00:01:48.870> something<00:01:49.170> like<00:01:49.290> this<00:01:52.760> well

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:53.760 
there should be something like this well

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.620 
there should be something like this well
that's<00:01:53.909> where<00:01:54.120> you<00:01:54.240> glued<00:01:54.510> the<00:01:54.659> two<00:01:54.810> together

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.969

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
and you see that's where you I'm glued

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.160 
and you see that's where you I'm glued
on<00:02:01.189> you<00:02:01.549> could<00:02:01.700> fill<00:02:01.880> that<00:02:01.909> in<00:02:02.090> if<00:02:02.719> you<00:02:02.869> wanted
