 useful bacchus but somewhere between the Var hills and the mouth of the 

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:19.669

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:29.599
 rosé and its specialty 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.410
 the region spends 80 8% of its production on rosé wines 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.690
 which represents 150 million bottles a year 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.050
 it is the first region in France to produce rosés rose 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.000
 with 38% of national production 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.100
 Provençal vineyards also provide 8% of roads and 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.320

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.210
 if Provence and the land of predilection of the rosé it is not a 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.699
 chance rosé de provence of our strength 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:56.030
 firstly because there has been tremendous progress in quality there is a 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.639
 quality revolution 

00:00:57.639 --> 00:01:01.689
 for a particular in Provence with the research center station on the 

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:02.490
 pink 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:07.130
 also because you see it here it was found quite 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.090
 propitious 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.430
 outside the rosé alves culture during its cultural site of the term 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.430
 the quality of rosé de provence 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.460
 goes uninhibited he is generous 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.560
 far from the elitist stereotypes sometimes listens social other color 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.820
 the rosé elixir privileged moments with family or friends 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.060
 but the beautiful pale pink color visual signature of the wines of Provence 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.560
 remains a manufacturing secret what makes the secret of color is a 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.300
 set of techniques that have been in place for twenty years 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.090
 among these techniques and there are two main hand first the use 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.570
 cold ouellette 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.570
 the mastery of French prevalent in all caricatures 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.360
 we are also very attentive 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.410
 to control the cold at the moment of relaxation in champions league in danger 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.090
 others in provence 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.469
 and the second the second 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:04.030
 the elements that I think there is good boost and the quality of the rosé 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.090
 it is the direct pressing that is to say this way that provence 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.029
 today to receive the vintage à la carte 

00:02:12.029 --> 00:02:14.469
 and finally sink concise 

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:15.409
 8 hours 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:16.650
 very very quickly 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.059
 what is the meaning of the pneumatic press 

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:23.590
 the Provencal vineyard is also remarkable reds 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.009
 powerful and robust 

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:28.839
 can accommodate several years in the cellar and whites serves for nothing tender 

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:29.899
 and delicate 

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:33.099
 the interprofessional council of the wines of provence brings together three appellations 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:34.559
 of controlled origin 

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:37.979
 coast of provence koto dax in Provence and Var hills in Provence 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:42.979
 they represent 96% of the volumes of the appellations of origin of Provence 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:47.879
 the cndp is thus an actor and without sky of the Provençal wine sector 

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:51.889
 the missionaries head of defoe author take 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:54.029
 so obviously the first role pretty 

00:02:54.029 --> 00:02:56.359
 % and communication 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:57.489
 after 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.270
 m at the very base of the 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.080
 and the five weeks of professional debates because the role of research and 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.439
 development in africa 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:07.919
 the center of the rosé a national center of rosé today 

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:11.449
 it's home to vidauban and is funded by 

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:12.569
 professional 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.319
 there is the service to quality that also allows to control for on 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.049
 linear throughout the year 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:21.959
 product quality following consumers and obviously the 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.499
 economic role since we can not do the 

00:03:24.499 --> 00:03:28.179
 communication of prospective development of our products without 

00:03:28.179 --> 00:03:31.949
 have economic data so spinelli advanced service 

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:35.090
 economic and which for you to a great value we took for the 

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:37.409
 decision making 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:40.899
 the three to raise covers a total area of ​​27 thousand hectares 

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:45.469
 between the Mediterranean and the Alps the Provencal vineyard stretches from west to 

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:47.789
 is over 200 km 

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:49.649
 in the bouches-du-rhône 

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:51.649
 and the alpes-maritimes 

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:55.459
 600 producers and 72 trading companies that produce each year 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.559
 about 170 million bottles 

00:03:58.559 --> 00:04:02.609
 the wines of Provence are precious supple and generous in aromas 

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:06.589
 they are from this local market crystalline kerou often swept by 

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:09.799
 the implacable for that of a haunting mistral 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:10.869
 the vines 

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:14.939
 overwhelmed by the sun this corsican of a light body during the afternoons 

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:16.269
 summer 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.449
 it's really a climate and a bottled earth that seduce 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:23.020
 more and more amateurs around the world 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.219
 it is true that until now we do not want to say a joke 

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:30.029
 exports arise at home because you know how less than 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.870
 the provence-alpes-côte d'azur region these 10 million tourists 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.919
 so we had of course some English Germans from Belgium who 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:41.919
 wants consumers but it is true that since 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:47.110
 I spent fairly recent new export more and more especially on the 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.779
 britain and germany and more specifically for two three years 

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:53.509
 on the usa 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:57.699
 its success in exporting the rosé de provence owes it to the fact that it is a 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:04:58.979
 diplomat wine 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:02.759
 as comfortable with an aioli served with a tajine he finds his 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:05.710
 place with chouchi but also fits perfectly of 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.479
 the traditional flavor of small Provencal stuffed 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:11.479
 this ability to transcend this nectar 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:13.549
 21st century
