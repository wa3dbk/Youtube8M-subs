yeah<00:00:01.949> hi<00:00:02.159> this<00:00:02.780> video<00:00:03.780> is<00:00:04.020> about<00:00:05.089> evolution

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
yeah hi this video is about evolution

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:12.290 
yeah hi this video is about evolution
and<00:00:06.470> how<00:00:07.470> I<00:00:07.500> see<00:00:08.040> it<00:00:09.380> to<00:00:10.380> me<00:00:10.559> evolution<00:00:11.400> begins

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
and how I see it to me evolution begins

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.480 
and how I see it to me evolution begins
in<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:12.960> brain<00:00:13.230> it's<00:00:13.860> not<00:00:14.040> something<00:00:14.460> that

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
in the brain it's not something that

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.960 
in the brain it's not something that
just<00:00:14.610> happens<00:00:16.130> usually<00:00:17.130> it<00:00:17.340> begins<00:00:17.760> with<00:00:17.850> a

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
just happens usually it begins with a

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.140 
just happens usually it begins with a
thought<00:00:19.100> for<00:00:20.100> example<00:00:21.800> maybe<00:00:22.800> one<00:00:23.160> day<00:00:23.400> long

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
thought for example maybe one day long

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.790 
thought for example maybe one day long
ago<00:00:24.510> we<00:00:25.289> may<00:00:25.470> have<00:00:25.590> lived<00:00:25.800> in<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.070> trees<00:00:26.400> and

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
ago we may have lived in the trees and

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.359 
ago we may have lived in the trees and
then<00:00:28.800> we<00:00:28.949> thought<00:00:29.279> well<00:00:29.699> why<00:00:30.660> not<00:00:31.099> move<00:00:32.099> out<00:00:32.340> of

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
then we thought well why not move out of

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.799 
then we thought well why not move out of
the<00:00:32.579> trees<00:00:34.550> so<00:00:35.550> we<00:00:35.579> move<00:00:36.059> down<00:00:36.329> on<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.600> ground

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
the trees so we move down on the ground

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.670 
the trees so we move down on the ground
and<00:00:37.170> then<00:00:37.980> we<00:00:38.100> lived<00:00:38.309> in<00:00:38.460> caves<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.379> then<00:00:40.379> we

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
and then we lived in caves and then we

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.130 
and then we lived in caves and then we
may<00:00:41.040> be<00:00:41.100> we<00:00:41.309> went<00:00:41.579> from<00:00:41.700> being<00:00:41.910> vegetarians<00:00:42.870> to

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
may be we went from being vegetarians to

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.440 
may be we went from being vegetarians to
be<00:00:43.260> in<00:00:43.350> mediators<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.629> now<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:46.309> we<00:00:47.309> have

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
be in mediators and now that we have

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:50.660 
be in mediators and now that we have
evolved<00:00:48.450> even<00:00:48.570> further<00:00:48.750> we<00:00:49.620> have<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.039> idea<00:00:50.460> of

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
evolved even further we have the idea of

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.330 
evolved even further we have the idea of
well<00:00:51.000> why<00:00:51.840> do<00:00:51.899> we<00:00:52.110> have<00:00:52.350> to<00:00:52.590> eat<00:00:52.710> meat<00:00:53.010> when

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
well why do we have to eat meat when

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.810 
well why do we have to eat meat when
there's<00:00:53.730> other<00:00:53.969> things<00:00:54.059> available<00:00:55.699> you<00:00:56.699> know

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
there's other things available you know

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.540 
there's other things available you know
and<00:00:57.320> back<00:00:58.320> before<00:00:59.899> this<00:01:00.899> even<00:01:01.289> people<00:01:02.039> had<00:01:02.399> the

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
and back before this even people had the

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.320 
and back before this even people had the
idea<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:03.059> why<00:01:03.539> hunt<00:01:04.309> when<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.580> can<00:01:05.820> just<00:01:05.850> grow

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
idea of why hunt when you can just grow

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.740 
idea of why hunt when you can just grow
your<00:01:06.570> food<00:01:07.159> so<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.189> lot<00:01:08.520> of<00:01:08.549> people<00:01:08.750> stopped

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
your food so a lot of people stopped

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.590 
your food so a lot of people stopped
moving<00:01:10.229> around<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.100> hunting<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:12.450> know

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
moving around and hunting and you know

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.480 
moving around and hunting and you know
because<00:01:12.960> they<00:01:13.080> would<00:01:13.200> have<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.409> move<00:01:13.740> with<00:01:14.010> the

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
because they would have to move with the

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.960 
because they would have to move with the
animals<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.299> hunt<00:01:16.080> so<00:01:16.530> they<00:01:17.310> thought<00:01:17.580> well<00:01:17.729> why

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
animals to hunt so they thought well why

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.910 
animals to hunt so they thought well why
do<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.450> why<00:01:18.750> not<00:01:18.780> just<00:01:19.200> stay<00:01:19.439> in<00:01:19.530> one<00:01:19.710> place

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
do that why not just stay in one place

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.630 
do that why not just stay in one place
and<00:01:21.020> grow<00:01:22.020> your<00:01:22.229> food<00:01:22.439> so<00:01:22.890> then<00:01:23.040> they<00:01:23.189> did<00:01:23.400> that

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
and grow your food so then they did that

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.140 
and grow your food so then they did that
but<00:01:24.540> then<00:01:24.750> maybe<00:01:25.020> they<00:01:25.950> had<00:01:26.159> some<00:01:26.189> bad<00:01:26.610> weather

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
but then maybe they had some bad weather

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.039 
but then maybe they had some bad weather
and<00:01:27.689> maybe<00:01:28.320> they<00:01:28.619> had<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:29.450> revert<00:01:30.450> back<00:01:30.479> to

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
and maybe they had to revert back to

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.499 
and maybe they had to revert back to
hunting<00:01:32.040> again<00:01:33.380> but<00:01:34.380> now<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:35.210> we<00:01:36.210> live<00:01:36.450> in

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
hunting again but now that we live in

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:44.620 
hunting again but now that we live in
this<00:01:36.900> age<00:01:37.890> of<00:01:40.250> you<00:01:41.250> know<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:42.030> way<00:01:42.180> we<00:01:42.360> do<00:01:42.540> now

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
this age of you know the way we do now

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.219 
this age of you know the way we do now
we<00:01:45.630> don't<00:01:46.200> have<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.799> eat<00:01:46.950> meat<00:01:47.600> but<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.930> lot<00:01:49.200> of

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
we don't have to eat meat but a lot of

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.130 
we don't have to eat meat but a lot of
people<00:01:49.380> don't<00:01:49.920> really<00:01:50.250> think<00:01:50.579> about<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:51.140> they

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
people don't really think about it they

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.340 
people don't really think about it they
just<00:01:52.170> do<00:01:52.619> with<00:01:53.009> their<00:01:53.369> parents<00:01:53.850> did<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.600> what

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
just do with their parents did and what

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.010 
just do with their parents did and what
they<00:01:55.380> were<00:01:55.530> told<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:56.070> do<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.509> other<00:01:57.509> people<00:01:57.869> do

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
they were told to do and other people do

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.670 
they were told to do and other people do
think<00:01:58.290> about<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:58.950> so<00:01:59.759> they<00:02:00.290> don't<00:02:01.290> eat<00:02:01.500> me

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
think about it and so they don't eat me

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.350 
think about it and so they don't eat me
because<00:02:02.250> I<00:02:02.369> think<00:02:02.610> more<00:02:02.820> about<00:02:02.909> what<00:02:03.210> they're

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
because I think more about what they're

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.340 
because I think more about what they're
eating

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
eating

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.499 
eating
so<00:02:06.070> I<00:02:06.430> think<00:02:06.610> that<00:02:08.550> if<00:02:09.550> we're<00:02:09.940> ever<00:02:10.090> going<00:02:10.390> to

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
so I think that if we're ever going to

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.550 
so I think that if we're ever going to
evolve<00:02:11.910> then<00:02:12.910> you<00:02:13.240> have<00:02:13.510> to<00:02:13.840> start<00:02:14.290> thinking

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
evolve then you have to start thinking

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.690 
evolve then you have to start thinking
about<00:02:15.100> what<00:02:15.610> you're<00:02:15.790> doing<00:02:15.989> and<00:02:17.700> questioning

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
about what you're doing and questioning

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.830 
about what you're doing and questioning
what<00:02:19.300> you<00:02:19.450> do<00:02:19.660> and<00:02:19.930> why<00:02:20.140> you<00:02:20.200> do<00:02:20.560> it<00:02:21.630> for<00:02:22.630> me<00:02:22.810> I

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
what you do and why you do it for me I

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:29.250 
what you do and why you do it for me I
became<00:02:23.470> vegan<00:02:24.569> or<00:02:25.569> vegetarian<00:02:26.790> about<00:02:27.959> 16<00:02:28.959> 17

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
became vegan or vegetarian about 16 17

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.380 
became vegan or vegetarian about 16 17
years<00:02:29.709> ago<00:02:30.040> I<00:02:30.930> began<00:02:32.069> to<00:02:33.069> gain<00:02:33.280> weight<00:02:33.310> and<00:02:33.819> I

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
years ago I began to gain weight and I

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.420 
years ago I began to gain weight and I
realized<00:02:35.080> it<00:02:35.260> pretty<00:02:35.470> much<00:02:35.650> everyone<00:02:36.190> around

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
realized it pretty much everyone around

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.270 
realized it pretty much everyone around
me<00:02:36.670> was<00:02:36.700> fat<00:02:37.350> including<00:02:38.350> my<00:02:38.470> family<00:02:38.709> members

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
me was fat including my family members

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.910 
me was fat including my family members
were<00:02:39.580> all<00:02:40.450> overweight<00:02:41.019> to<00:02:41.380> the<00:02:41.500> point<00:02:41.769> of

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
were all overweight to the point of

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.660 
were all overweight to the point of
obesity<00:02:42.910> and<00:02:43.140> I<00:02:44.140> realized<00:02:44.590> that<00:02:44.860> I<00:02:45.250> didn't

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
obesity and I realized that I didn't

that's<00:05:04.880> about<00:05:05.270> it<00:05:06.430> it's<00:05:07.430> called<00:05:07.640> evolution<00:05:08.000> so

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:09.760 
that's about it it's called evolution so

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.300 
that's about it it's called evolution so
a<00:05:10.760> lot<00:05:11.540> of<00:05:11.570> people<00:05:11.900> get<00:05:12.200> angry<00:05:12.500> at<00:05:12.950> me<00:05:13.130> because

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
a lot of people get angry at me because

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.970 
a lot of people get angry at me because
of<00:05:13.940> one<00:05:14.630> of<00:05:14.750> my<00:05:14.870> other<00:05:15.020> videos<00:05:15.470> where<00:05:15.680> I<00:05:15.710> called

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:15.980 
of one of my other videos where I called

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.830 
of one of my other videos where I called
meat-eaters<00:05:16.490> retarded<00:05:16.970> but<00:05:17.090> you<00:05:17.570> know<00:05:17.690> the

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
meat-eaters retarded but you know the

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:20.680 
meat-eaters retarded but you know the
thing<00:05:18.050> is<00:05:18.110> you<00:05:18.980> when<00:05:19.220> you're<00:05:19.340> eating<00:05:19.730> animals

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
thing is you when you're eating animals

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.390 
thing is you when you're eating animals
flesh<00:05:20.930> you're<00:05:21.170> eating<00:05:21.530> everything<00:05:22.040> that<00:05:22.310> this

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
flesh you're eating everything that this

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.210 
flesh you're eating everything that this
animal<00:05:22.700> is<00:05:23.030> eight<00:05:23.300> so<00:05:23.870> if<00:05:24.260> animals<00:05:24.980> are<00:05:25.070> being

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.220 
animal is eight so if animals are being

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.360 
animal is eight so if animals are being
fed<00:05:25.610> you<00:05:26.120> know<00:05:26.150> polluted<00:05:27.020> you<00:05:27.410> know<00:05:27.530> grains

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
fed you know polluted you know grains

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.910 
fed you know polluted you know grains
that<00:05:28.670> have<00:05:28.880> you<00:05:29.480> know<00:05:29.740> derivatives<00:05:30.740> of

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:30.920 
that have you know derivatives of

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.440 
that have you know derivatives of
mercury<00:05:31.340> because<00:05:31.610> they<00:05:31.760> use<00:05:32.030> this<00:05:32.960> type<00:05:33.350> of

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:34.450 
mercury because they use this type of

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:36.730 
mercury because they use this type of
fungicide<00:05:35.450> that<00:05:35.750> prevents<00:05:36.230> fungus<00:05:36.650> from

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:36.740 
fungicide that prevents fungus from

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.410 
fungicide that prevents fungus from
growing<00:05:36.980> on<00:05:37.160> the<00:05:37.250> grain<00:05:37.490> that<00:05:37.760> has<00:05:38.390> a

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:38.420 
growing on the grain that has a

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.300 
growing on the grain that has a
derivative<00:05:38.870> mercury<00:05:39.260> then<00:05:39.500> yeah<00:05:39.710> you<00:05:39.740> will<00:05:40.160> be

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.310 
derivative mercury then yeah you will be

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:41.740 
derivative mercury then yeah you will be
retarded<00:05:40.670> eventually<00:05:41.420> if<00:05:41.510> you<00:05:41.570> eat<00:05:41.720> enough

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
retarded eventually if you eat enough

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:46.300 
retarded eventually if you eat enough
meat<00:05:42.340> ok<00:05:43.340> so<00:05:44.390> off<00:05:44.600> and<00:05:45.100> for<00:05:46.100> the<00:05:46.190> other

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:46.310 
meat ok so off and for the other

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.090 
meat ok so off and for the other
people<00:05:46.610> take<00:05:46.790> care
