your<00:01:43.050> speedo<00:01:43.320> coupler<00:01:44.130> right<00:01:44.310> here<00:01:44.720> turn<00:01:45.720> your

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
your speedo coupler right here turn your

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:52.249 
your speedo coupler right here turn your
bike<00:01:46.170> on<00:01:47.570> and<00:01:48.830> with<00:01:49.830> your<00:01:49.979> bike<00:01:50.130> in<00:01:50.340> neutral<00:01:51.259> go

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
bike on and with your bike in neutral go

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.840 
bike on and with your bike in neutral go
to<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.470> back<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.830> the<00:01:52.890> bike<00:01:53.039> and<00:01:53.310> spin<00:01:53.700> the

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
to the back of the bike and spin the

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.310 
to the back of the bike and spin the
wheel<00:01:54.030> this<00:01:54.450> is<00:01:54.600> why<00:01:54.720> we<00:01:54.899> have<00:01:55.050> the<00:01:55.170> bike

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
wheel this is why we have the bike

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.320 
wheel this is why we have the bike
elevated<00:01:55.979> off<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.130> ground<00:01:56.520> okay

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
elevated off the ground okay

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.590 
elevated off the ground okay
give<00:01:57.869> her<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:58.020> spin<00:01:58.970> and<00:01:59.970> we<00:02:00.119> have<00:02:00.270> speed

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
give her a spin and we have speed

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.440 
give her a spin and we have speed
sensing<00:02:01.610> when<00:02:02.610> you<00:02:02.729> disconnect<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.240> speed

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
sensing when you disconnect a speed

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.210 
sensing when you disconnect a speed
sensor<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:04.080> might<00:02:04.289> need<00:02:04.440> yourself<00:02:04.800> a<00:02:04.920> little

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
sensor you might need yourself a little

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.490 
sensor you might need yourself a little
screwdriver<00:02:05.640> this<00:02:06.420> little<00:02:06.690> tab<00:02:06.929> here<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.319> can

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
screwdriver this little tab here you can

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.960 
screwdriver this little tab here you can
push<00:02:07.679> down<00:02:07.709> with<00:02:07.950> your<00:02:08.220> fingers<00:02:08.520> but<00:02:08.700> I<00:02:08.729> find

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
push down with your fingers but I find

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.449 
push down with your fingers but I find
it<00:02:09.090> just<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.270> little<00:02:09.660> bit<00:02:09.810> easier<00:02:10.280> shove<00:02:11.280> that

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
it just a little bit easier shove that

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.600 
it just a little bit easier shove that
little<00:02:11.700> screwdriver<00:02:12.180> down<00:02:12.510> inside<00:02:13.280> and<00:02:14.280> kind

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
little screwdriver down inside and kind

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.080 
little screwdriver down inside and kind
of<00:02:14.640> wiggler<00:02:15.000> out<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:15.590> disconnect<00:02:16.590> it<00:02:16.680> and

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
of wiggler out and disconnect it and

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:24.260 
of wiggler out and disconnect it and
again<00:02:18.090> spin<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.930> tire<00:02:20.569> and<00:02:21.569> we<00:02:21.750> have<00:02:23.120> we<00:02:24.120> have

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
again spin the tire and we have we have

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.120 
again spin the tire and we have we have
no<00:02:24.450> reading<00:02:24.840> so<00:02:25.020> we<00:02:25.170> have<00:02:25.410> effectively

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
no reading so we have effectively

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.850 
no reading so we have effectively
disconnected<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.090> speed<00:02:27.300> sensor<00:02:27.800> now<00:02:28.800> we

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
disconnected the speed sensor now we

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.440 
disconnected the speed sensor now we
need<00:02:29.069> to<00:02:29.160> get<00:02:29.250> our<00:02:29.400> supplied<00:02:29.730> cable<00:02:30.120> from<00:02:30.240> heel
