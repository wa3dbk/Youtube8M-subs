00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
crosspieces will have these holes

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.430 
crosspieces will have these holes
drilled<00:00:30.980> through<00:00:31.250> the<00:00:31.430> edge<00:00:31.989> one<00:00:32.989> edge<00:00:33.200> will

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
drilled through the edge one edge will

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.640

crosspiece and the and the small hole is

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.310 
crosspiece and the and the small hole is
obviously<00:00:44.900> are<00:00:45.019> in<00:00:45.140> the<00:00:45.260> top<00:00:47.140> okay<00:00:48.140> you're

obviously are in the top okay you're
going<00:00:48.410> to<00:00:48.470> get<00:00:48.790> seven<00:00:49.790> ladders<00:00:50.239> two<00:00:50.960> of<00:00:51.080> them

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
going to get seven ladders two of them

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.020 
going to get seven ladders two of them
were<00:00:51.260> going<00:00:51.440> to<00:00:51.530> look<00:00:51.650> like<00:00:51.680> this<00:00:52.100> where<00:00:52.910> the

were going to look like this where the

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.840 
were going to look like this where the
bottle<00:00:53.360> rats<00:00:53.600> are<00:00:53.809> on<00:00:53.899> one<00:00:54.110> side<00:00:54.140> of<00:00:54.770> the<00:00:55.010> of

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
bottle rats are on one side of the of

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.910 
bottle rats are on one side of the of
the<00:00:56.090> upright<00:00:56.840> and<00:00:57.050> you're<00:00:57.380> going<00:00:57.500> to<00:00:57.590> get<00:00:57.680> five

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
the upright and you're going to get five

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.229 
the upright and you're going to get five
of<00:00:58.100> them<00:00:58.219> that<00:00:58.399> look<00:00:58.520> like<00:00:58.670> this<00:00:58.879> where<00:00:59.120> the

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 
of them that look like this where the

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:01.389 
of them that look like this where the
bottle<00:00:59.570> rest<00:00:59.780> are<00:01:00.050> on<00:01:00.140> both<00:01:00.379> sides<00:01:00.739> of<00:01:01.100> the

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399 
bottle rest are on both sides of the

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:05.200 
bottle rest are on both sides of the
upright<00:01:02.950> also<00:01:03.950> the<00:01:04.100> long<00:01:04.280> distance<00:01:04.520> between

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
upright also the long distance between

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.830 
upright also the long distance between
the<00:01:05.990> end<00:01:06.229> of<00:01:06.710> the<00:01:06.920> upright<00:01:07.369> and<00:01:07.610> the<00:01:08.450> bottle

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
the end of the upright and the bottle

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.859 
the end of the upright and the bottle
rest<00:01:09.080> denotes<00:01:10.039> that<00:01:10.190> that's<00:01:10.490> the<00:01:10.880> top<00:01:11.509> of<00:01:11.750> the

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
rest denotes that that's the top of the

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:13.500 
rest denotes that that's the top of the
wine<00:01:12.170> rack

wine rack

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.740 
wine rack
obviously<00:01:14.350> the<00:01:14.940> shorter<00:01:15.940> distance<00:01:16.360> is<00:01:16.720> the

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
obviously the shorter distance is the

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.710 
obviously the shorter distance is the
bottom<00:01:17.200> of<00:01:17.320> the<00:01:17.410> line<00:01:17.590> right<00:01:18.480> okay<00:01:19.480> so<00:01:19.540> now

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
bottom of the line right okay so now

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.480 
bottom of the line right okay so now
we're<00:01:19.870> going<00:01:19.960> to<00:01:20.020> put<00:01:20.170> the<00:01:20.320> cross<00:01:20.500> pieces<00:01:20.860> on

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
we're going to put the cross pieces on

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:40.490 
we're going to put the cross pieces on
to<00:01:22.450> the<00:01:22.600> ladders

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.530 

okay<00:01:41.500> so<00:01:41.560> we<00:01:41.740> finished<00:01:42.070> putting<00:01:42.130> on<00:01:42.580> the

okay so we finished putting on the

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.359 
okay so we finished putting on the
bottom<00:01:43.869> cross<00:01:44.110> piece<00:01:44.350> on<00:01:44.530> this<00:01:44.619> side<00:01:44.890> now

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
bottom cross piece on this side now

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:46.530 
bottom cross piece on this side now
we're<00:01:45.490> going<00:01:45.580> to<00:01:45.640> do<00:01:45.759> exactly<00:01:45.909> the<00:01:46.299> same<00:01:46.330> thing

wine<00:02:09.190> rack<00:02:09.429> and<00:02:10.060> we're<00:02:10.179> going<00:02:10.330> to<00:02:10.360> just<00:02:10.600> slowly

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
wine rack and we're going to just slowly

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.870 
wine rack and we're going to just slowly
turn<00:02:11.170> it<00:02:11.319> over<00:02:11.530> and<00:02:11.920> do<00:02:12.100> exactly<00:02:12.250> the<00:02:12.850> same

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.640 

okay<00:02:19.970> that<00:02:20.120> just<00:02:20.239> took<00:02:20.420> a<00:02:20.540> few<00:02:20.690> seconds<00:02:21.140> and<00:02:21.349> we

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
okay that just took a few seconds and we
