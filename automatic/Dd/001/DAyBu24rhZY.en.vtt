00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 very good everyone here we are in a 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.580
 new video of gta 5 online in the colo 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.799
 I'm going to teach how to tune the 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.830
 car in a special way not like painting 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.960
 the secondary color of color shape 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.120
 not pearly and as you know the color 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.650
 secondary has no pearlescent color but 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.060
 I'm going to teach you how to do it first 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.220
 what we have to do is paint the car 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.970
 chromed color both colors the 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.769
 primary and primary and secondary and 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.289
 that chroma the whole thing after we have to 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.320
 leave the garage and re-enter a 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.000
 garage to losantos custom sorry once 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.690
 that we have left and we are already entered 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.399
 then we go here to main color and 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.660
 good to remember that good in this color 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:44.040
 It depends on the color you have placed on 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.710
 the cross is for example if you have a 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.750
 color that is with green color for example 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.250
 it will turn green if not 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.989
 it had yellow then yellow and 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.230
 if you give any color then 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.000
 any way as you see here we are 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:00.350
 trying to put it to pearl but says 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.220
 Your vehicle must have a metallic color 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.140
 when replacing the metallic color 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.600
 we replace the chromed one that is not 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.310
 we can put everything together but there is a 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.930
 little trick to put it in both 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.330
 together I agree that I am going to teach you 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.710
 right now and right now says that the 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.630
 pearly color because you can not put 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.130
 we have to put the metallic one but I 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.350
 I do not want to put on metallized then 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.649
 we simply have to enter 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:29.659
 metalized get out and once we get out 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:31.940
 we have to go to wheels or tires or 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:34.280
 as you do not depend on for example on 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:38.179
 Spain are wheels and there in america 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.560
 south will be different we go to wheels 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:41.319
 then we have to enter the tire 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.330
 and we have to buy tires 

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:46.789
 customized we have to put it as 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.979
 you are watching here in the video we have 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:50.810
 to put it on and put back the 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.149
 default tires 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.360
 I have done this step we have to go 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:57.799
 again to paint 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.360
 pretty easy to do and here being a 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:02.270
 step by step now we are going to have 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.200
 clarified and as you can see we can put a 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.490
 pearly color to the car me for example 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.840
 I was looking for 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.280
 We are looking for various colors and 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.330
 final I decided on the lime green 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.650
 because it's the one I like the most 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.150
 then the market one then 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.769
 mixed with the color of the critical I 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.840
 I'll teach it below but 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.790
 as you see you can choose the 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.100
 color that I want for example 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.690
 I here as you see the lime green chosen 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.880
 but you can say the color that ordered 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.100
 nothing but you know that then you are going to 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.260
 mix with the color you have in the 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:37.569
 I have done this because you have to 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:40.130
 return to the primary color and give 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.870
 child color once you give it to the 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.440
 color of crise that the car will stay 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.610
 A) Yes 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.560
 with the color of your crew and chrome 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.000
 then what will we have to do for the 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.569
 secondary color we do not put the color 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.650
 secondary 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:58.269
 well we go mentalized and paint the 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:00.579
 car as we want , you can see that 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:02.799
 when painting the secondary color then it 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:05.049
 we have a face do not need 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:08.560
 paint it pearly that will stay like that 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:10.900
 a little weird rinsing does not 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.120
 I have painted green gasoline in this 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.819
 case because I've seen that it was the best 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.409
 how good is the best but green 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:19.930
 gasoline or green I do not remember the 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:21.909
 silver gasoline as you see is 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:24.400
 pretty cool and good, it depends 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:26.469
 a lot of the color of the crew does not 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.060
 because of course when you put the color of the 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:29.650
 crew if you put it yellow it will look 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.829
 otherwise if you put it in blue then 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.310
 it will look differently for example my 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:40.299
 friend gustavo yesterday he put it in color 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:41.560
 red and painted it blue and good 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:43.780
 that mix of colors because they make it 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.750
 see blue on one side purple in the middle 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.849
 and red for the other hand the truth is 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.709
 that is pretty cool this trick 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:52.480
 and well, I wanted to share it with 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.989
 you already know that it is not a great trick 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.210
 say oh god what piece of trick of 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:59.250
 Gray 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:02.670
 not the truth that it is not a piece of gray 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.230
 but it is pretty cool I 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.490
 honestly I'm going to stay with this one 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.600
 with this color 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:10.640
 although the tires have been forgotten 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:13.710
 with changing it and well then simply 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:17.340
 you have to good to appreciate it because you 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:19.020
 you're going to go out in the sun and well then what 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.660
 you have already have turning 

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:23.880
 personalized and good is the car that you 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.230
 I say the one of my friend gustavo that also 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.320
 going to park inside stop overcoming in 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:30.150
 description how good it has has 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.420
 the two types of colors the red and the 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:35.100
 blue that the truth that is pretty 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:37.740
 quite handsome as good as I am going to 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.710
 teach now on the one hand it looks red and 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:43.290
 on the other hand and for another blue and good 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:46.500
 Well, the truth is that it does not have much 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:48.120
 does not have a lot of history this trick 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.770
 but well, I wanted to share it 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.110
