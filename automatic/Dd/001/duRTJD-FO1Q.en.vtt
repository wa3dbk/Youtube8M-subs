so<00:01:09.740> I<00:01:09.770> guess<00:01:10.039> size<00:01:10.880> obviously<00:01:11.299> ease<00:01:11.779> of<00:01:12.109> entry

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
so I guess size obviously ease of entry

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.769 
so I guess size obviously ease of entry
you<00:01:12.859> know<00:01:13.039> the<00:01:13.249> car<00:01:13.509> general<00:01:14.509> kind<00:01:14.689> of

00:01:14.769 --> 00:01:14.779 
you know the car general kind of

00:01:14.779 --> 00:01:16.660 
you know the car general kind of
durability<00:01:15.049> I<00:01:15.380> think<00:01:15.679> is<00:01:15.859> probably<00:01:16.249> has<00:01:16.399> a

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
durability I think is probably has a

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.519 
durability I think is probably has a
factor<00:01:17.359> to<00:01:17.450> play<00:01:17.630> something<00:01:18.139> that<00:01:18.170> she's<00:01:18.409> not

00:01:18.519 --> 00:01:18.529 
factor to play something that she's not

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:24.010 
factor to play something that she's not
gonna<00:01:18.679> trash<00:01:21.459> the<00:01:22.459> jump<00:01:22.759> up<00:01:22.939> factor<00:01:23.539> here<00:01:23.810> is

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
gonna trash the jump up factor here is

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.809 
gonna trash the jump up factor here is
just<00:01:24.319> create<00:01:24.619> its<00:01:24.799> really<00:01:25.340> low<00:01:25.490> to<00:01:25.549> the<00:01:25.729> ground

00:01:25.809 --> 00:01:25.819

just create its really low to the ground
it's<00:01:26.299> going<00:01:26.450> to<00:01:26.539> be<00:01:26.599> easy<00:01:26.899> for<00:01:27.170> those<00:01:27.319> big<00:01:27.499> dogs

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.339 
one a lot it's fairly you know neat in
terms<00:01:49.399> of<00:01:49.700> the<00:01:49.789> size<00:01:49.999> you<00:01:50.630> can<00:01:50.659> put<00:01:51.049> her<00:01:51.139> in<00:01:51.200> the

00:01:51.339 --> 00:01:51.349 
terms of the size you can put her in the

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:54.399 
terms of the size you can put her in the
back<00:01:51.590> I<00:01:51.919> think<00:01:52.549> segregation<00:01:53.239> is<00:01:53.329> important<00:01:53.869> so

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
back I think segregation is important so

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:57.309 
back I think segregation is important so
you<00:01:54.439> can<00:01:54.859> keep<00:01:55.009> the<00:01:55.189> back<00:01:56.319> compartmentalize

00:01:57.309 --> 00:01:57.319 
you can keep the back compartmentalize

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:59.319 
you can keep the back compartmentalize
for<00:01:57.529> the<00:01:57.590> dog<00:01:57.770> and<00:01:58.069> then<00:01:58.159> leave<00:01:58.729> the<00:01:58.969> back

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329 
for the dog and then leave the back

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:03.260 
for the dog and then leave the back
seats<00:01:59.630> as<00:01:59.779> proper<00:02:00.020> back<00:02:00.259> seats

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.730
