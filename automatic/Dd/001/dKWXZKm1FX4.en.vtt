00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
our work we're going to chain three okay

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:45.820 
our work we're going to chain three okay
then<00:02:44.239> we're<00:02:44.390> going<00:02:44.660> to<00:02:44.720> do<00:02:45.350> our<00:02:45.380> shell

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
then we're going to do our shell

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.060 
then we're going to do our shell
sequence<00:02:46.550> into<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:47.900> next<00:02:48.230> chain<00:02:48.560> one<00:02:48.860> space

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
sequence into the next chain one space

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.460 
sequence into the next chain one space
so<00:02:49.430> that's<00:02:49.519> going<00:02:49.670> to<00:02:49.790> be<00:02:49.940> that<00:02:50.239> gap<00:02:50.570> in<00:02:50.930> our

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
so that's going to be that gap in our

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.070 
so that's going to be that gap in our
shell<00:02:51.769> from<00:02:51.980> the<00:02:52.040> row<00:02:52.280> before<00:02:52.870> so<00:02:53.870> we're<00:02:53.989> gonna

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
shell from the row before so we're gonna

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:04.920 
shell from the row before so we're gonna
do<00:02:54.350> a<00:02:54.380> double<00:02:55.120> crochets

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.339 

then<00:03:05.530> we'll<00:03:05.709> chain<00:03:06.040> one<00:03:06.310> and<00:03:06.549> then<00:03:06.689> two<00:03:07.689> two

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
then we'll chain one and then two two

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:10.559 
then we'll chain one and then two two
more<00:03:08.680> double<00:03:08.980> crochets<00:03:09.519> into<00:03:09.939> that<00:03:10.180> same

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
more double crochets into that same

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:26.340 
more double crochets into that same
chain<00:03:10.959> one<00:03:11.200> space

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.350 

all<00:03:26.650> right<00:03:26.890> then<00:03:27.280> we<00:03:27.430> are<00:03:27.580> going<00:03:27.940> to<00:03:28.120> do<00:03:28.330> a

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
all right then we are going to do a

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.010 
all right then we are going to do a

chaining three then we're going to work

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.760 
chaining three then we're going to work
our<00:04:30.160> shell<00:04:30.490> pattern<00:04:30.900> into<00:04:31.900> the<00:04:32.170> next<00:04:32.440> chain

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
our shell pattern into the next chain

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:42.000 
our shell pattern into the next chain
one<00:04:33.010> space<00:04:36.600> so<00:04:37.600> two<00:04:37.660> double<00:04:38.170> crochets<00:04:40.980> then<00:04:41.980> a

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
one space so two double crochets then a

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.580 
one space so two double crochets then a
chain<00:04:42.460> one<00:04:42.760> and<00:04:43.000> then<00:04:43.170> two<00:04:44.170> more<00:04:44.410> double
