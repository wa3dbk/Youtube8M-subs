 movie you can really see the 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.060
 children, of course, I do believe that now 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.759
 children are of broad criteria for 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:26.240
 kids that's why it's already discovery kids 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:29.310

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:34.910

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.130
 come with the complete kit is already a 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.290
 children's film with broad criteria 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.150
 also yes all this first 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.830
 movie what reflection leaves you the fact 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.300
 of making movies in colombia that all the 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.790
 world speaks that is that it has mediated that is 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.340
 complicated everything is complicated in this 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:57.400
 via nothing is as easy as it seems 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.470
 it's as easy as it seems this is 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.440
 made by professionals please do not 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.960
 try it in their homes or not do not 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.979
 understand in their homes 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.140
 these tricks are performed by 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:09.640
 professionals andrés this takes away is a 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.320
 convention of child artists who are 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.320
 looking for a field to develop your 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.360
 skill you have children no I do not have 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:21.409
 children but but I will do them in some 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:26.539
 moment if that is the same 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:28.730
 at any time a house and if the 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:31.250
 children then come watching them 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:34.400
 only children know where children 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:39.270
 children come from some lettuces that 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:42.200
 they collect some big birds 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.390
 so lettuces are called storks 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.670
 they grab like that they tie up and then the 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.110
 little clouds finish making the baby and 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.140
 then the stork goes 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:56.010
 so flying if you get to a door 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.000
 where he sees the dads of the stork and 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.770
 André, you are always like 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.140
 improvising the issue of being given a 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.210
 libretto or the libretto the melody be 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.000
 true because that seems like the show of 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.800
 André López, of course, what happens is that 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.899
 improvisation really does not exist the 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.060
 improvisation is really the management of 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.620
 a pre-studied arsenal of things and 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.660
 situations that one already has in the 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:21.360
 head is hard work to create that 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.360
 arsenal 24 or 7 days a week yes 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.170
 I am a conspirator greetings to the 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.280
 spock its kids that are looking for 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.920
 as I tell you achieve your dreams 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.050
 good artistic is little 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.690
 integral artists studies a lot 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.130
 strive hard to know science 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.260
 the arts the mathematics the 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.180
 humanities everything works for an artist 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.610
 because an artist is like artists 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.800
 of the Renaissance they knew everything and 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.019
 they could sustain their jobs knowing 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.959
 of everything and obsessing about everything like that 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:52.510
 look look obsess you are interested have 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:54.130
 Be beautiful with life and treat the 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.420
 others as you would like to be treated and 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.930
 do not do to another what you would not like 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.930
