12k from roland amazing new drum set so
I'll<00:00:48.530> based<00:00:48.739> around<00:00:48.890> the<00:00:49.159> td-30<00:00:49.640> sound<00:00:50.030> module

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
I'll based around the td-30 sound module

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.689 
I'll based around the td-30 sound module
which<00:00:51.019> is<00:00:51.170> the<00:00:51.290> same<00:00:51.440> module<00:00:51.710> that<00:00:52.040> the<00:00:52.190> top<00:00:52.489> of

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
which is the same module that the top of

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:55.990 
which is the same module that the top of
the<00:00:52.760> line<00:00:52.940> the<00:00:53.170> td-30<00:00:54.170> kv<00:00:54.680> uses<00:00:55.159> so<00:00:55.699> for<00:00:55.879> a<00:00:55.909> lot

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
the line the td-30 kv uses so for a lot

less deal with this kit you can get all

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.829 
less deal with this kit you can get all
the<00:00:57.799> power<00:00:58.339> of<00:00:58.610> the<00:00:58.729> td-30<00:00:59.949> the<00:01:00.949> td-30<00:01:01.400> is<00:01:01.839> the

the power of the td-30 the td-30 is the

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:05.049 
the power of the td-30 the td-30 is the

next in the succession line from the TD

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.690 
next in the succession line from the TD
20<00:01:05.210> and<00:01:05.630> it<00:01:06.290> it<00:01:06.590> builds<00:01:07.070> on<00:01:07.310> that<00:01:07.340> legacy

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
20 and it it builds on that legacy

having great playability one of the

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:11.770 
having great playability one of the
things<00:01:10.280> that's<00:01:10.430> really<00:01:10.579> going<00:01:10.820> on<00:01:11.060> now<00:01:11.329> is<00:01:11.570> we

things that's really going on now is we
are<00:01:12.079> doing<00:01:12.439> this<00:01:12.590> thing<00:01:12.740> called<00:01:12.950> supernatural

00:01:16.529 --> 00:01:16.539 
sound and then that easily explained is

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:20.109 
sound and then that easily explained is
you<00:01:17.539> put<00:01:17.750> into<00:01:17.930> the<00:01:18.140> drum<00:01:18.380> and<00:01:18.700> it<00:01:19.700> will<00:01:19.850> give

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
you put into the drum and it will give

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:21.849 
you put into the drum and it will give
you<00:01:20.240> the<00:01:20.539> appropriate<00:01:20.750> sound<00:01:21.140> out<00:01:21.439> that's

that simple that's what we all strive

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.510 
that simple that's what we all strive
for<00:01:23.810> in<00:01:23.960> our<00:01:24.049> acoustic<00:01:24.289> drums<00:01:24.679> that's<00:01:25.189> what<00:01:25.369> we

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
for in our acoustic drums that's what we

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.669 
for in our acoustic drums that's what we
want<00:01:25.729> from<00:01:26.210> our<00:01:26.359> electronic<00:01:26.899> drums<00:01:27.109> check

00:01:27.669 --> 00:01:27.679 
want from our electronic drums check

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:32.319 
want from our electronic drums check
this<00:01:27.770> out<00:01:30.640> plain<00:01:31.640> to<00:01:31.729> the<00:01:31.820> center<00:01:32.060> of<00:01:32.090> the<00:01:32.179> edge

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:32.329 
this out plain to the center of the edge

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:34.989 
this out plain to the center of the edge
to<00:01:32.659> sound<00:01:32.899> thins<00:01:33.409> out<00:01:33.679> just<00:01:34.399> like<00:01:34.490> an<00:01:34.640> acoustic

00:01:34.989 --> 00:01:34.999 
to sound thins out just like an acoustic

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:37.359 
to sound thins out just like an acoustic
drum<00:01:35.179> if<00:01:35.420> I<00:01:35.780> play<00:01:36.020> fast<00:01:36.439> you<00:01:36.710> know<00:01:36.829> an<00:01:36.920> acoustic

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
drum if I play fast you know an acoustic

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:39.399 
drum if I play fast you know an acoustic
drum<00:01:37.609> my<00:01:38.210> first<00:01:38.600> instructor<00:01:39.049> always<00:01:39.320> should

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
drum my first instructor always should

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:40.989 
drum my first instructor always should
tell<00:01:39.740> me<00:01:39.890> your<00:01:40.310> role<00:01:40.520> should<00:01:40.700> sound<00:01:40.909> like

00:01:40.989 --> 00:01:40.999 
tell me your role should sound like

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:42.940 
tell me your role should sound like
tearing<00:01:41.539> paper<00:01:41.749> right<00:01:42.200> there's<00:01:42.679> not<00:01:42.799> much

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
tearing paper right there's not much

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.819 
tearing paper right there's not much
attack<00:01:43.310> so<00:01:43.640> when<00:01:43.999> I<00:01:44.030> play<00:01:44.270> fast<00:01:44.630> you'll<00:01:45.530> hear

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829 
attack so when I play fast you'll hear

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:47.469 
attack so when I play fast you'll hear
not<00:01:46.159> much<00:01:46.340> attack<00:01:46.640> and<00:01:46.850> as<00:01:46.909> they<00:01:47.030> play<00:01:47.210> slower

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
not much attack and as they play slower

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.209 
not much attack and as they play slower
like<00:01:47.749> doubles<00:01:48.200> and<00:01:48.499> then<00:01:48.619> singles<00:01:49.009> in<00:01:49.100> this

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:49.219 
like doubles and then singles in this

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:51.249 
like doubles and then singles in this
case<00:01:49.399> you<00:01:49.549> will<00:01:49.640> heal<00:01:49.850> more<00:01:49.999> attack<00:01:50.390> on<00:01:50.630> the

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:51.259 
case you will heal more attack on the

00:01:51.259 --> 00:02:00.350 
case you will heal more attack on the
drum

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.940 

it<00:02:01.360> really<00:02:01.660> adds<00:02:01.870> to<00:02:02.020> the<00:02:02.140> realism<00:02:02.500> so<00:02:02.800> when<00:02:02.920> I

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
it really adds to the realism so when I

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.500 
it really adds to the realism so when I
play<00:02:03.250> like<00:02:03.610> things<00:02:03.940> with<00:02:04.120> a<00:02:04.150> lot<00:02:04.240> of<00:02:04.270> ghosts

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
play like things with a lot of ghosts

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:16.560 
play like things with a lot of ghosts
nodes<00:02:14.040> it<00:02:15.040> really<00:02:15.640> sounds<00:02:16.030> like<00:02:16.300> you're

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
nodes it really sounds like you're

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.780 
nodes it really sounds like you're
playing<00:02:16.690> acoustic<00:02:17.050> it<00:02:17.560> exactly<00:02:18.280> as<00:02:18.520> you<00:02:18.700> would

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
playing acoustic it exactly as you would

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.110 
playing acoustic it exactly as you would
expect<00:02:20.100> has<00:02:21.100> a<00:02:21.130> couple<00:02:21.610> other<00:02:21.730> really<00:02:22.000> cool

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
expect has a couple other really cool

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.120 
expect has a couple other really cool
features<00:02:22.450> for<00:02:22.750> me<00:02:22.930> one<00:02:23.380> it's<00:02:23.590> really<00:02:23.830> easy<00:02:23.950> to

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
features for me one it's really easy to

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
features for me one it's really easy to
use<00:02:24.190> because<00:02:24.520> if<00:02:24.670> you<00:02:24.730> want<00:02:24.880> to<00:02:24.940> do<00:02:25.000> any

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
use because if you want to do any

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.060 
use because if you want to do any
editing<00:02:25.360> of<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:25.840> 100<00:02:26.230> kits<00:02:26.410> are<00:02:26.560> on<00:02:26.650> board<00:02:26.860> you

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
editing of the 100 kits are on board you

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.560 
editing of the 100 kits are on board you
can<00:02:27.220> you're<00:02:27.520> using<00:02:27.700> pictures<00:02:28.000> and<00:02:28.390> you're

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
can you're using pictures and you're

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.600 
can you're using pictures and you're
using<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:29.110> acoustic<00:02:29.590> drum<00:02:29.830> paradigm<00:02:30.400> which

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
using the acoustic drum paradigm which

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.100 
using the acoustic drum paradigm which
means<00:02:30.820> you're<00:02:30.970> using<00:02:31.120> duct<00:02:31.450> tape<00:02:31.540> and<00:02:31.870> heads

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
means you're using duct tape and heads

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.600 
means you're using duct tape and heads
and<00:02:32.530> that<00:02:32.680> sort<00:02:32.950> of<00:02:33.010> thing<00:02:33.070> to<00:02:33.250> do<00:02:33.340> all<00:02:33.490> your

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
and that sort of thing to do all your

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:34.650 
and that sort of thing to do all your
editing<00:02:33.940> so<00:02:34.060> you<00:02:34.120> really<00:02:34.300> not<00:02:34.450> to<00:02:34.540> learn

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
editing so you really not to learn

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.330 
editing so you really not to learn
anything<00:02:34.870> new<00:02:35.020> the<00:02:35.950> other<00:02:36.070> thing<00:02:36.310> that's

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
anything new the other thing that's

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.370 
anything new the other thing that's
