00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:05.130
 can you in this video we are going to do 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.270
 per cent the fourth generation tobacco touch camera test 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:13.569
 what I told you in a previous video I think it was 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:16.890
 in the comparison of 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.099
 finally four months in the post 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:22.489
 and well here I found mosquera side as I said 

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:25.759
 with the chepo all of equateur generation 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:27.090
 I recommend you 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.060
 who by the way 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.470
 you contender of oswalt to the maximum 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.800
 by closing aqueous solution 7 20 28 so that they can appreciate 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.670
 per 100 the exact amount of the camera 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.730
 I defend I will not assume it with the computer or anything 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.040
 I will not go directly with the mobiles of the epoc 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.750
 so that they can appreciate 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.160
 what is its quality in terms of tacit approval and pp 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.810
 in video h 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:03.870
 percent now I'm going to talk a little about what is my opinion about the pp camera 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.320
 in my opinion, it is a 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.440
 it is not an excellent camera 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.860
 but neither is it a bad camera 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.750
 percent to have only one as to 13 mega pixels from the back 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.180
 and eat it 3 megapixels pola comrade efron such that makes it 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.900
 a camera is only d of moments 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.820
 to get out of step with we need here 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.530
 percent some quick photo 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.900
 this iphone camera you idea pretty 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.539
 for example before it 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:39.430
 % and ski hites 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.700
 in case not only with the timely procedural iphone music for example with the 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.380
 alcohol 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.960
 unpublished in the need to remove 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.340
 in pictures that is obviously obviously not the camera 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.039
 portas ine 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:55.290
 I tried representation 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.750
 and I have my feet the expo touch camera 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.090
 as I told you this camera basically serves us 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.200
 percent in this case will end 100 back 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.299
 it does not serve just to get out of 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:12.679
 to leave the moment mind when we do not have a camera 

00:02:12.679 --> 00:02:17.510
 either an SLR or if we have the camera in the case of the iphone 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.319
 the desire team 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:22.319
 we have what is the upper house and for all 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.090
 which is undoubtedly takes us from the paso doble that means thor in mind 

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:32.209
 Now talking about what is the front camera of this same boat touch 

00:02:32.749 --> 00:02:34.389
 by the way 

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:35.889
 it also serves us 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:38.889
 but if most people 

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:41.400
 i obviously 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.429
 he only played for what follows is sad 

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:45.499
 p 

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:48.719
 it's a relatively good camera 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:52.989
 it goes is has a lot of cooperation to what is to avoid ipad 2 resembles 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:54.039
 quite 

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:58.009
 so also that it does not work for him what exists 

00:02:58.929 --> 00:03:01.259
 perfectly in what we can take out 

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:04.549
 what are model photos that are photos we can also record 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.389
 but it's basically not good for what you need 

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:12.219
 now one thing to know is a back camera 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:15.829
 etc etc in what is that photo mode 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:19.069
 unites us and not what is enabled a little crazy autofocus 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.329
 that should be the template that we will have 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:25.729
 for second major in unbeaten quality another 

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:30.169
 with improved expo cautious focus 

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:33.959
 for 100 more the professional follows you can almost tell 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.309
 but I did not tell you before 

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:39.299
 I thought that this camera is just to get by 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:43.299
 We are not going to say that it is an excellent camera but it is not a camera either 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:44.219
 bad 

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:47.179
 percent certainly that is much better 

00:03:47.179 --> 00:03:50.089
 at 15 that the country suffers an alienation 

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:51.759
 percent 

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:55.229
 is certainly much better either in the back or the front 

00:03:55.899 --> 00:03:58.899
 i ban in the opinion would be that 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:02.929
 I repeat again is a camera just to get out of step 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:06.869
 for specific times when we have to 

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:11.559
 Take some picture or record a video too fast this camera 

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:14.949
 del potosino sidibÃ© per hundred without any doubt 

00:04:15.939 --> 00:04:21.449
 now and to finish you video as I said beginning with a hundred 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:23.159
 I think you see 

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:25.389
 at full resolution stopped 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:28.409
 what for if you can appreciate the quality 

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:31.599
 d this camera will set to 7 20 p 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:33.960
 that would be its highest quality 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.319
 as for the video ovation 

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:39.509
 so vanoc I leave you with that 

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:40.840
 for one hundrerd 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.840
 at the end of the video I will put some pictures 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.590
 percent so you can also appreciate the quality of photos that we 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.740
 takes out the fourth-generation pepo touch camera 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.360
 and as I said I'm going to upload directly to the mobile 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.569
 For something 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:57.919
 I do not intend to pass it to 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:02.029
 the computer to edit anything because if you have a lot in your 

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:02.949
 resolution 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:05.839
 so it's not indirectly from the country 

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:09.029
 and good before but that they served as deputy of the video 

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:14.489
 i leave you with that by jose biden be commented on the title team thank you
