around<00:00:55.960> the<00:00:56.379> amp<00:00:56.589> here<00:00:56.889> and<00:00:57.069> I'll<00:00:57.159> show<00:00:57.190> you

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
around the amp here and I'll show you

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:59.399 
around the amp here and I'll show you
the<00:00:57.760> top<00:00:57.999> and<00:00:58.269> then<00:00:58.359> I'll<00:00:58.479> show<00:00:58.749> you<00:00:58.809> the<00:00:58.989> input

00:00:59.399 --> 00:00:59.409 
the top and then I'll show you the input

the top and then I'll show you the input
section<00:00:59.679> output<00:01:00.280> section<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:02.350> can<00:01:02.530> see<00:01:02.739> the

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:02.889 
section output section you can see the

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:04.979 
section output section you can see the
sensitivity<00:01:03.280> adjustment<00:01:03.789> up<00:01:04.360> here<00:01:04.629> it<00:01:04.750> shows

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:04.989 
sensitivity adjustment up here it shows

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.700 
sensitivity adjustment up here it shows
you<00:01:05.049> when<00:01:05.710> you're<00:01:05.860> peaking<00:01:06.750> we<00:01:07.750> have<00:01:08.020> high

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
you when you're peaking we have high

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.959 
you when you're peaking we have high
paths<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:10.090> it<00:01:10.630> goes<00:01:10.810> from<00:01:11.020> 70<00:01:11.680> to<00:01:11.710> 700<00:01:12.579> or<00:01:12.759> if

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:12.969 
paths and it goes from 70 to 700 or if

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:17.179 
paths and it goes from 70 to 700 or if
you<00:01:13.090> do<00:01:13.240> the<00:01:13.390> multiplier<00:01:14.020> from<00:01:14.469> 700<00:01:15.280> to<00:01:15.509> 7,000

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
you do the multiplier from 700 to 7,000

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:23.700 
you do the multiplier from 700 to 7,000
bandpass<00:01:18.570> 700<00:01:19.570> to<00:01:20.609> 7070<00:01:21.609> to<00:01:21.729> 700<00:01:22.469> so<00:01:23.469> you<00:01:23.560> can

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
bandpass 700 to 7070 to 700 so you can

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.190 
bandpass 700 to 7070 to 700 so you can
run<00:01:23.859> your<00:01:23.979> mids<00:01:24.250> fully<00:01:24.609> active<00:01:25.090> and<00:01:25.359> then<00:01:26.020> your

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
run your mids fully active and then your

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.679 
run your mids fully active and then your
low<00:01:26.350> paths<00:01:26.649> of<00:01:26.920> course<00:01:27.159> you've<00:01:27.369> got<00:01:27.399> your<00:01:27.909> 35

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:28.689 
low paths of course you've got your 35

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:32.639 
low paths of course you've got your 35
to<00:01:28.899> 350<00:01:29.560> or<00:01:29.770> used<00:01:30.100> to<00:01:30.250> multiplier<00:01:30.789> and<00:01:31.090> 70<00:01:31.689> to

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
to 350 or used to multiplier and 70 to

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:37.440 
to 350 or used to multiplier and 70 to
700<00:01:33.549> very<00:01:34.420> cool<00:01:35.130> this<00:01:36.130> I<00:01:36.340> believe<00:01:36.369> this<00:01:37.060> item<00:01:37.359> I

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
700 very cool this I believe this item I

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.919 
700 very cool this I believe this item I
believe<00:01:37.719> is<00:01:37.840> brand<00:01:38.229> new<00:01:38.380> has<00:01:38.859> never<00:01:39.219> been<00:01:39.429> used

00:01:39.919 --> 00:01:39.929 
believe is brand new has never been used

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:42.419 
believe is brand new has never been used
it<00:01:40.929> was<00:01:41.049> sent<00:01:41.289> to<00:01:41.350> me<00:01:41.560> just<00:01:41.829> kind<00:01:42.009> of<00:01:42.130> to<00:01:42.250> do<00:01:42.399> a

00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:42.429 
it was sent to me just kind of to do a

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:47.459 
it was sent to me just kind of to do a
video<00:01:42.670> with<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:44.229> NT<00:01:44.829> 200<00:01:45.460> so<00:01:45.929> it<00:01:46.929> has<00:01:47.140> cool

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:47.469 
video with the NT 200 so it has cool

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:50.489 
video with the NT 200 so it has cool
LEDs<00:01:47.979> here<00:01:48.539> to<00:01:49.539> light<00:01:49.689> up<00:01:49.869> for<00:01:50.049> the<00:01:50.140> channels

00:01:50.489 --> 00:01:50.499 
LEDs here to light up for the channels

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:52.459 
LEDs here to light up for the channels
that<00:01:50.649> show<00:01:50.829> you<00:01:50.890> your<00:01:51.159> output<00:01:51.520> level<00:01:51.850> and

00:01:52.459 --> 00:01:52.469 
that show you your output level and

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:55.230 
that show you your output level and
here's<00:01:53.469> your<00:01:53.619> switches<00:01:54.009> down<00:01:54.159> here<00:01:54.549> for<00:01:55.090> your

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
here's your switches down here for your

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.249 
here's your switches down here for your
Tom's<00:01:55.810> twos<00:01:56.759> your<00:01:57.759> divided<00:01:58.240> by<00:01:58.329> tens<00:01:58.659> and<00:01:59.109> your

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.120 
art as with most old-school Orion gear
we<00:02:10.800> have<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.430> dim<00:02:11.700> plugs<00:02:12.060> you<00:02:12.420> can<00:02:12.569> see<00:02:13.130> here

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
we have the dim plugs you can see here

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.130 
we have the dim plugs you can see here
and<00:02:14.370> you<00:02:14.459> also<00:02:14.550> have<00:02:14.849> RCA<00:02:15.270> jacks<00:02:15.690> these<00:02:15.989> are

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
and you also have RCA jacks these are

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.120 
and you also have RCA jacks these are
your<00:02:16.230> inputs<00:02:17.450> so<00:02:18.450> it<00:02:18.870> can<00:02:19.020> take<00:02:19.230> two<00:02:19.470> inputs<00:02:19.890> or

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
your inputs so it can take two inputs or

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.729 
your inputs so it can take two inputs or
it<00:02:20.250> can<00:02:20.370> take<00:02:20.520> four<00:02:20.880> and<00:02:21.230> it's<00:02:22.230> got<00:02:22.440> what<00:02:22.620> it's

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
it can take four and it's got what it's

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.490 
it can take four and it's got what it's
called<00:02:22.950> a<00:02:23.040> split<00:02:23.400> low<00:02:23.700> with<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.810> dim

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
called a split low with the dim

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.350 
called a split low with the dim
connector<00:02:26.010> and<00:02:26.280> a<00:02:26.430> normal<00:02:26.790> so<00:02:27.120> you'd<00:02:27.239> normally

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
connector and a normal so you'd normally

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.320 
connector and a normal so you'd normally
just<00:02:27.660> use<00:02:27.870> either<00:02:27.989> one<00:02:28.260> or<00:02:28.530> two<00:02:28.709> dens<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:29.370> then

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
just use either one or two dens and then

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.160 
just use either one or two dens and then
your<00:02:30.480> outputs<00:02:30.870> are<00:02:31.110> all<00:02:31.290> dens<00:02:31.650> from<00:02:32.069> this<00:02:32.250> one

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
your outputs are all dens from this one

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.350 
your outputs are all dens from this one
you<00:02:34.170> got<00:02:34.380> three<00:02:34.739> obviously<00:02:35.160> for<00:02:35.640> your<00:02:35.819> hellos

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
you got three obviously for your hellos

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.229 
you got three obviously for your hellos
mids<00:02:36.720> and<00:02:36.870> highs<00:02:36.959> and<00:02:37.880> here's<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:39.030> mode

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
mids and highs and here's the mode

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:42.110 
mids and highs and here's the mode
switch<00:02:39.630> and<00:02:40.050> the<00:02:40.920> split<00:02:41.220> switch<00:02:41.519> now<00:02:41.730> the<00:02:41.790> mode

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
switch and the split switch now the mode

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.559 
switch and the split switch now the mode
I<00:02:42.360> believe<00:02:42.720> is<00:02:42.989> where<00:02:43.170> you<00:02:43.319> can<00:02:43.890> set<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.569> like

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
I believe is where you can set the like
