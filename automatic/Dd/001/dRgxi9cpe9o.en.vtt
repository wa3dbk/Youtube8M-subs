00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:08.860
 today I want to offer you an easy recipe 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:12.010
 and fresh crunchy from the outside and 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.600
 internally soft the pavlova in 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.830
 this time of year and I'll do it 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.680
 always at least once 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.750
 and why is the strawberry period that 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.940
 I really like them so much 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:25.660
 we take some parchment paper and 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:34.420
 helping with a flat plate 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:38.129
 we draw this circumference there 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:42.629
 will serve later in a bowl 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.629
 we beat 4 egg whites 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.890
 when we turn the bowl upside down e 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:59.589
 bianchino slip we can add 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:03.449
 250 g of granulated sugar, however 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:03.449
 we reach out a little at a time 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:15.580
 look who are beautiful egg whites 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:18.820
 after reaching the sugar it becomes 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:21.039
 all beautiful shiny after we have 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:25.710
 added all the sugar we can 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:29.530
 mix a teaspoon of cornstarch 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:33.149
 a teaspoon of vanilla extract is 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.149
 a teaspoon of white vinegar 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:46.530
 at this point this moment of 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:53.470
 our meringue on our baking paper 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:57.100
 and helping ourselves with a spatula we leave the 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:02:00.190
 center a little lower than the sides 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.700
 which will be one just a little more 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.700
 tall 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:10.270
 we bake in the oven preheated to 150 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.120
 degrees for about an hour 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:19.830
 now put the whipped cream already 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:28.450
 sweetened at your center and not 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:31.950
 eliminated and then we add many but 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.950
 just so many strawberries
