00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
alright i wanted to mention a little bit

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.990 
alright i wanted to mention a little bit
more<00:00:03.449> about<00:00:03.770> determining<00:00:04.770> what<00:00:05.460> these

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
more about determining what these

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.240 
more about determining what these
startup<00:00:06.810> items<00:00:07.200> are<00:00:07.440> so<00:00:07.919> let's<00:00:08.429> focus<00:00:08.790> on<00:00:09.080> ESD

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:10.250 
startup items are so let's focus on ESD

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.580 
startup items are so let's focus on ESD
us<00:00:11.250> beam<00:00:11.519> on<00:00:11.790> this<00:00:12.599> is<00:00:12.750> the<00:00:12.900> startup<00:00:13.290> item

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
us beam on this is the startup item

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.169 
us beam on this is the startup item
which<00:00:13.740> is<00:00:13.830> kind<00:00:14.009> of<00:00:14.040> cryptic<00:00:14.580> so<00:00:14.880> if<00:00:14.940> we<00:00:15.000> go<00:00:15.089> to

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
which is kind of cryptic so if we go to

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.330 
which is kind of cryptic so if we go to
the<00:00:15.299> command<00:00:15.690> we<00:00:15.900> see<00:00:16.080> up<00:00:16.320> that<00:00:16.859> is<00:00:17.160> the

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
the command we see up that is the

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.450 
the command we see up that is the
program<00:00:18.080> ESD<00:00:19.080> USB<00:00:19.920> Mon<00:00:20.250> dot<00:00:20.850> exe<00:00:21.529> now<00:00:22.529> what<00:00:23.340> we

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
program ESD USB Mon dot exe now what we

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.490 
program ESD USB Mon dot exe now what we
want<00:00:23.550> to<00:00:23.699> do<00:00:23.820> is<00:00:23.970> understand<00:00:24.420> what<00:00:24.570> this<00:00:24.689> is<00:00:24.930> do

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
want to do is understand what this is do

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.740 
want to do is understand what this is do
we<00:00:25.680> really<00:00:25.710> want<00:00:26.160> it<00:00:26.310> or<00:00:26.699> do<00:00:27.029> we<00:00:27.180> not<00:00:27.330> want<00:00:27.390> it

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
we really want it or do we not want it

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.320 
we really want it or do we not want it
running<00:00:28.140> automatically<00:00:28.920> so<00:00:29.519> first<00:00:30.179> thing

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
running automatically so first thing

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.930 
running automatically so first thing
we'll<00:00:30.480> do<00:00:30.660> is<00:00:30.689> we<00:00:31.289> will<00:00:31.470> go<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.940> Internet

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
we'll do is we will go to Internet

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.200 
we'll do is we will go to Internet
Explorer<00:00:33.440> now<00:00:34.440> I'm<00:00:34.860> actually<00:00:35.340> going<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.000> go<00:00:36.090> to

Google

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.800 

on<00:00:44.710> Google<00:00:45.640> if<00:00:45.850> we<00:00:46.840> type<00:00:47.140> in<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:48.520> name<00:00:48.760> of<00:00:49.000> that

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:49.810 
on Google if we type in the name of that

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.770 
on Google if we type in the name of that
process

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780

we<00:00:53.410> will<00:00:53.680> be<00:00:54.190> able<00:00:54.370> to<00:00:54.550> determine<00:00:55.559> what<00:00:56.559> it

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
we will be able to determine what it

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.220 
we will be able to determine what it
does<00:00:56.829> so<00:00:57.250> again<00:00:57.719> ESD<00:00:58.719> USB<00:00:59.530> Mon<00:00:59.969> exe<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:02.050> let's

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
does so again ESD USB Mon exe so let's

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:09.570 
does so again ESD USB Mon exe so let's
see<00:01:02.410> e<00:01:03.150> SD<00:01:04.150> USB<00:01:05.340> mon<00:01:06.340> dot<00:01:07.180> b<00:01:07.630> x<00:01:07.930> e<00:01:08.310> so<00:01:09.310> if<00:01:09.369> we<00:01:09.460> do

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
see e SD USB mon dot b x e so if we do

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.320 
see e SD USB mon dot b x e so if we do
our<00:01:09.610> google<00:01:10.060> search<00:01:11.759> whoa<00:01:12.759> that<00:01:13.030> was<00:01:13.180> pretty

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 
there is more than one program out there

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:08.100 
there is more than one program out there
or<00:02:05.170> sorry<00:02:05.439> web<00:02:05.619> page<00:02:05.860> that's<00:02:06.310> telling<00:02:06.790> us<00:02:07.110> now

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
what this is again now that we know a

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.690 
what this is again now that we know a
little<00:02:10.269> bit<00:02:10.420> about<00:02:10.660> it<00:02:10.810> epson<00:02:11.489> printer<00:02:12.489> USB

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
little bit about it epson printer USB

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.180 
little bit about it epson printer USB
monitor<00:02:13.150> well<00:02:13.540> I<00:02:13.780> mean<00:02:14.200> I<00:02:14.410> don't<00:02:14.560> even<00:02:14.799> have<00:02:14.950> an

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
monitor well I mean I don't even have an

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.660 
monitor well I mean I don't even have an
epson<00:02:15.340> printer<00:02:15.790> epson<00:02:16.030> printer<00:02:16.780> so<00:02:17.440> I<00:02:17.739> will

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
epson printer epson printer so I will

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.900 
epson printer epson printer so I will
easily<00:02:19.000> uncheck<00:02:19.660> it<00:02:19.810> and<00:02:19.840> know<00:02:20.650> that<00:02:21.459> it's<00:02:21.700> not

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
easily uncheck it and know that it's not

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.819 
easily uncheck it and know that it's not
going<00:02:22.180> to<00:02:22.299> affect<00:02:22.420> me<00:02:22.840> that<00:02:23.019> program<00:02:23.500> will<00:02:23.650> not

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:23.829 
going to affect me that program will not

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:25.949 
going to affect me that program will not
run<00:02:24.070> it<00:02:24.489> will<00:02:24.670> not<00:02:24.850> take<00:02:25.090> my<00:02:25.329> memory<00:02:25.690> and<00:02:25.810> slow

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
run it will not take my memory and slow

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.560 
run it will not take my memory and slow
down<00:02:26.019> my<00:02:26.260> computer<00:02:26.579> for<00:02:27.579> no<00:02:27.700> purpose<00:02:27.910> I'm

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
down my computer for no purpose I'm

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.120 
down my computer for no purpose I'm
going<00:02:28.810> to<00:02:28.900> uncheck<00:02:29.079> it<00:02:29.500> that<00:02:29.829> means<00:02:30.010> it

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
going to uncheck it that means it

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.610 
going to uncheck it that means it
temporarily<00:02:30.790> will<00:02:31.600> not<00:02:31.780> run<00:02:31.989> automatically

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
temporarily will not run automatically

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.770 
temporarily will not run automatically
