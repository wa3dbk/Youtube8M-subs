00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
the game kind of like new monarchy dead

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.840 
the game kind of like new monarchy dead
orbit<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.740> FWC<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:19.920> we<00:01:20.009> also<00:01:20.220> in<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.610> tower

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
orbit and FWC that we also in the tower

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.420 
orbit and FWC that we also in the tower
it's<00:01:21.750> not<00:01:21.960> being<00:01:22.259> confirmed<00:01:22.680> as<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.280> whether

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
it's not being confirmed as to whether

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.149

Osiris<00:01:24.030> will<00:01:24.180> be<00:01:24.420> in<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.720> tower<00:01:24.930> but<00:01:25.830> my<00:01:26.100> guess

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
Osiris will be in the tower but my guess

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.160 
Osiris will be in the tower but my guess
is<00:01:26.400> they<00:01:26.670> will<00:01:26.880> be<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.299> I'll<00:01:27.659> either<00:01:27.869> be<00:01:28.020> in

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
is they will be and I'll either be in

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.960 
is they will be and I'll either be in
the<00:01:28.439> same<00:01:28.650> section<00:01:29.070> that<00:01:29.220> we<00:01:29.310> saw<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.549> iron

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
the same section that we saw the iron

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.999 
the same section that we saw the iron
banner<00:01:30.210> or<00:01:30.840> they'll<00:01:31.170> be<00:01:31.290> in<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.409> blocked<00:01:31.770> off

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
banner or they'll be in the blocked off

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.530
