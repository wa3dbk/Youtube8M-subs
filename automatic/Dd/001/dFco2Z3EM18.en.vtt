00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.500
 Subscribed! 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.300
 The next day... 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.500
 Lately no videos have been added corresponding to your subscriptions 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.500
 2:00 pm - DasBoSchitt returns to his home from work 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.100
 There is! 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.200
 Keep it there 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.400
 I have the suspect 1 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.000
 I said throw it in the trash 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 Ok, you can go now 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.600
 Shortened version 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.300
 Do not piss 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.600
 Oh please 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 I already told you not to touch that 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.800
 Those shoes should be comfortable 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.600
 I bet you can hang out with them all day without noticing anything 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.000
 I wish I had some shoes like that 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 My mom told me that I could know a lot about a person because of his shoes 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.200
 Where did they go... 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.800
 Where have you been... 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.000
 I want a lot of shoes 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.600
 I bet if I think about those shoes I remember my first pair of shoes 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.000
 My mom told me that they would take me everywhere ... 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.300
 Fresh air! 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.000
 Oh God! 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.700
 I like turtles 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.000
 Leave it to me 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.600
 Do you have any kind of plan? 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.200
 Well, now I'm in the computer room 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.500
 I'm trying to access Baker's private files 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:48.600
 Baker's files? 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.000
 Do not you need a password? 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.300
 Sure, but ... there are other ways ... 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.200
 You are a hacker? 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.000
 Sep, that describes me pretty well. 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.000
 What's going on there? 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.900
 Let me guess... 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.000
 HAAAX! (hacks) 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.500
 This guy makes my hair stand on end 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.500
 Shut up your fucking mouth! 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:32.300
 What? Crazy German Boy is evolving! 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.300
 Crazy German Boy has evolved into Furious German Man! 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.300
 Did you say that you have this ... this stupid electric car, you old-fashioned ones that do not have anything better to do? 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.650
 Oh my God! I have to... 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:09.900
 What's wrong? 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.200
 My heart... 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.100
 Your heart? 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.800
 Is something wrong with your heart? 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.300
 What I can do? 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.500
 Pills ... pills ... 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:21.200
 Pills? 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:23.000
 Where are your pills? 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.500
 They're in the car ... car ... cof cof ... 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.800
 Pills! Pastillas, pills, pills! LOL! 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.800
 WHAT ARE YOU WATCHING ?! 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.600
 Mission: Rescue Dr Magnusson 

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.000
 There you are... 

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.300
 Hooray on Sundays! XDD 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.650
 What will be next in this parade of interruptions ... 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.700
 Has 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:18.500
 You have failed 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:29.000
 Translated by Navarrete854 

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.500
 Until next time... 

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.000
 I hate vans 

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.800
 Oh shit! 

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.500
 Piece of shit!
