00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:07.429 
now that chisels come in various sizes

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:10.850 
now that chisels come in various sizes
this<00:00:08.429> one<00:00:08.490> is<00:00:08.760> a<00:00:08.790> 1<00:00:09.059> inch<00:00:09.240> chisel<00:00:09.650> you<00:00:10.650> want<00:00:10.800> to

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
be careful with the chisels because the

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.160 
be careful with the chisels because the
blade<00:00:13.349> is<00:00:13.380> it's<00:00:13.920> pretty<00:00:14.250> sharp<00:00:14.549> so<00:00:14.910> be<00:00:15.719> careful

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
grain of the wood

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.330 
grain of the wood
notice<00:00:35.579> how<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:36.210> grain<00:00:36.480> goes<00:00:37.110> long<00:00:37.500> ways<00:00:37.890> on

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
notice how the grain goes long ways on

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.910 
notice how the grain goes long ways on
this<00:00:38.730> board<00:00:39.059> you<00:00:39.870> don't<00:00:39.989> want<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.620> want<00:00:40.829> to

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
you want draw out the space that you

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.870 
you want draw out the space that you
want<00:01:03.090> chiseled<00:01:03.570> out<00:01:03.769> place<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:05.010> blade<00:01:05.250> at<00:01:05.549> one

want chiseled out place the blade at one
end<00:01:06.119> against<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.990> grain<00:01:07.260> but<00:01:08.010> go<00:01:08.220> straight

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
end against the grain but go straight

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.000 
end against the grain but go straight
down<00:01:09.150> with<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:12.409> once<00:01:13.409> you've<00:01:13.560> made<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.770> good

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
down with it once you've made a good

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.820 
down with it once you've made a good
indentation<00:01:14.400> into<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.210> wood<00:01:15.530> then<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.680> can

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
indentation into the wood then you can

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.190 
indentation into the wood then you can
come<00:01:17.040> at<00:01:17.159> an<00:01:17.280> angle<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:17.909> go<00:01:18.210> with<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.930> grain

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
come at an angle and go with the grain

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.469 
come at an angle and go with the grain
and<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:20.070> will<00:01:20.220> pull<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:20.610> out<00:01:20.759> here<00:01:21.060> let<00:01:21.210> me<00:01:21.240> make

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
and it will pull it out here let me make

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:28.219 
and it will pull it out here let me make
the<00:01:21.659> other<00:01:24.229> and<00:01:25.229> now<00:01:26.040> we'll<00:01:26.250> go<00:01:27.049> straight<00:01:28.049> on

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
the other and now we'll go straight on

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.840 
the other and now we'll go straight on
down<00:01:28.350> you<00:01:28.560> might<00:01:28.710> even<00:01:28.860> want<00:01:29.220> if<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:29.520> want<00:01:29.759> a

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
down you might even want if you want a

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.100 
down you might even want if you want a
really<00:01:30.210> exact<00:01:30.689> hole<00:01:31.369> go<00:01:32.369> along<00:01:32.640> all<00:01:32.850> lines<00:01:33.360> and

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
really exact hole go along all lines and

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.060 
really exact hole go along all lines and
go<00:01:34.560> straight<00:01:34.799> down<00:01:35.119> mark<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:36.270> out<00:01:37.070> delineate

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
go straight down mark it out delineate

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.090 
go straight down mark it out delineate
that<00:01:38.270> the<00:01:39.270> area<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.689> want<00:01:39.869> chiseled<00:01:40.229> out<00:01:40.320> by

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
that the area you want chiseled out by

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:50.780 
that the area you want chiseled out by
going<00:01:41.280> straight<00:01:41.700> down<00:01:41.729> with<00:01:42.150> the<00:01:42.240> chisel

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.320 

then<00:01:51.790> take<00:01:52.479> it<00:01:52.600> at<00:01:52.720> one<00:01:52.900> end<00:01:54.210> against<00:01:55.210> the

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
then take it at one end against the

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.460 
then take it at one end against the
grain<00:01:55.570> and<00:01:56.130> chisel<00:01:57.960> towards<00:01:58.960> the<00:01:59.050> other<00:01:59.200> end

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
grain and chisel towards the other end

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.510 
grain and chisel towards the other end
of<00:01:59.560> the<00:01:59.650> board<00:01:59.950> and<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:02.740> order<00:02:02.979> notice<00:02:03.369> how

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
of the board and the order notice how

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.480 
of the board and the order notice how
the<00:02:03.580> wood<00:02:03.910> is<00:02:04.060> just<00:02:04.090> lifting<00:02:04.750> right<00:02:04.960> up<00:02:05.229> if<00:02:06.040> you

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
the wood is just lifting right up if you

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.389 
the wood is just lifting right up if you
get<00:02:06.670> a<00:02:06.700> good<00:02:06.940> leverage<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:08.860> don't<00:02:09.039> have<00:02:09.250> to

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
get a good leverage you don't have to

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.520 
get a good leverage you don't have to
tap<00:02:09.610> very<00:02:09.850> hard<00:02:10.179> and<00:02:10.420> you<00:02:10.600> can<00:02:10.780> lift<00:02:11.170> you<00:02:11.410> can

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
tap very hard and you can lift you can

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.010 
tap very hard and you can lift you can
leverage<00:02:11.860> up<00:02:12.250> that<00:02:12.490> piece<00:02:12.730> of<00:02:12.880> wood<00:02:13.060> kind<00:02:13.930> of

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
leverage up that piece of wood kind of

up<00:02:24.450> notice<00:02:25.450> how<00:02:25.540> that<00:02:25.600> piece<00:02:25.900> of<00:02:26.080> wood<00:02:26.290> that<00:02:26.320> I

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
up notice how that piece of wood that I

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.910 
up notice how that piece of wood that I
just<00:02:26.739> marked<00:02:27.070> out<00:02:27.250> came<00:02:28.000> right<00:02:28.270> out<00:02:28.620> of<00:02:29.620> course

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
just marked out came right out of course

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.590 
just marked out came right out of course
you<00:02:30.040> can<00:02:30.190> perfect<00:02:30.610> a<00:02:30.730> little<00:02:30.850> bit<00:02:31.180> and<00:02:31.450> come

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
you can perfect a little bit and come

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.040 
you can perfect a little bit and come
back<00:02:31.720> over<00:02:31.959> here<00:02:32.550> we<00:02:33.550> want<00:02:33.820> leverage<00:02:34.720> it<00:02:34.870> out

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
back over here we want leverage it out

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.100 
back over here we want leverage it out
and<00:02:35.730> if<00:02:36.730> you<00:02:36.850> want<00:02:36.880> it<00:02:37.150> deeper<00:02:37.630> if<00:02:37.780> it's<00:02:37.959> not

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
and if you want it deeper if it's not

and if you want it deeper if it's not
deep<00:02:38.410> enough<00:02:38.560> just<00:02:39.340> keep<00:02:39.580> working<00:02:40.000> it<00:02:40.030> keep

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
deep enough just keep working it keep

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.630 
deep enough just keep working it keep
going<00:02:40.480> straight<00:02:41.019> down<00:02:41.050> and<00:02:41.620> then<00:02:42.100> go<00:02:42.370> at<00:02:42.519> an

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
going straight down and then go at an

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.300 
going straight down and then go at an
angle<00:02:42.970> with<00:02:43.600> the<00:02:43.870> grain<00:02:44.110> and<00:02:44.769> you<00:02:44.830> should<00:02:45.130> get

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
angle with the grain and you should get

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.729 
angle with the grain and you should get
a<00:02:45.550> really<00:02:45.970> good<00:02:46.120> piece<00:02:46.360> out<00:02:46.600> of<00:02:46.630> the<00:02:46.810> wood<00:02:46.989> and

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
a really good piece out of the wood and

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.850 
a really good piece out of the wood and
that's<00:02:47.980> how<00:02:48.160> to<00:02:48.220> use<00:02:48.310> a<00:02:48.430> chisel
