Sasuke<00:00:51.149> master<00:00:51.690> because<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:52.170> seemingly<00:00:52.530> was

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
Sasuke master because it seemingly was

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.439 
Sasuke master because it seemingly was
labeling<00:00:53.129> those<00:00:53.280> three<00:00:53.489> people<00:00:53.850> according<00:00:54.270> to

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
labeling those three people according to

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.119 
labeling those three people according to
one<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.719> those<00:00:54.960> like<00:00:55.170> kisara<00:00:55.649> that<00:00:55.860> would<00:00:56.039> be

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
one of those like kisara that would be

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.740

the<00:00:56.250> rival<00:00:56.730> obviously<00:00:57.300> who<00:00:57.420> else<00:00:57.570> would<00:00:57.719> be

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
the rival obviously who else would be

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.090

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
enough Naruto is the hero which he was

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.170 
enough Naruto is the hero which he was
the<00:01:01.530> hero<00:01:01.800> obviously<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:02.489> his<00:01:02.670> story<00:01:02.969> and

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
the hero obviously of his story and

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.420

that's all he looked at him like all the
big<00:01:06.869> hero<00:01:07.200> because<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.619> can<00:01:07.770> see<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:08.100> he

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
big hero because you can see that he

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.710 
big hero because you can see that he
clearly<00:01:08.640> has<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:08.850> beef<00:01:09.119> with<00:01:09.150> his<00:01:09.360> father<00:01:09.570> I
