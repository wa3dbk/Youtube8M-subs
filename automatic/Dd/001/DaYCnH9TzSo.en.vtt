00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:19.770
 for the hole of essence dear friends themselves comrade 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.510
 the sledge was left on the cart to them. no we 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.880
 continue to pass 1 part of the fund and 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:33.300
 we stopped on the 15th mission making our way 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:35.820
 the wolf follows your footsteps 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.670
 and your people are exhausted by them in countless 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.660
 fights need to find a place where 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:45.330
 can hide and recuperate 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.430
 the perfect solution is to take cover in the swamps but 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.070
 the only way there is past 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.140
 wild boar family castle 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:55.019
 since the boar is now in the campaign 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.930
 together with your army you have 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:01:01.760
 nice opportunity to take his castle and 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.760
 to recoup the successes of god 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.070
 make your way through the main county 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:09.690
 wild boar and take cover in the marshes behind it you 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.030
 have to fight fiercely 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.370
 and most importantly quickly to catch up 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.200
 boar returns 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:21.230
 break the gates of the ram destroy 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:25.970
 garrison and go to the swamp and so 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:28.650
 We are trying to pass the mission number 15 there 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:33.680
 the main goal is just to get through 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:36.390
 the castle seems to be the plot and the way further 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.550
 now we need to save archers and 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.440
 crossbowmen 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:48.240
 crossbowmen that they are very valuable units 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:51.950
 for some reason, constantly interrogation in the meantime 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:58.719
 summing up assault units 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:02:06.020
 beward redhead set the stairs and 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:06.799
 let everyone put the gate itself 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.549
 the stairs 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.549
 switch 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:20.120
 and while there is movement 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:26.620
 we move the stairs uni there does not go 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.620
 the fighting began a very moving game 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.650
 manageable on board you will see and ready 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:40.370
 the mountains 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:42.250
 in fact so in the meantime we send 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:46.090
 the stairs 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:49.090
 barbican turnover removes sides 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.090
 to send 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.680
 where district 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.680
 someone immediately on a little 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.340
 important here 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.230
 incomprehensible 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.970
 couple of minutes 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.879
 we give 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.250
 these years 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:43.160
 archers poisoned let's say on the tower 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:04:02.790
 there is still left . good guys plan 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:02.790
 from the boar and 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.209
 they 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:43.020
 pillow and having fought whole counties 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:45.419
 your people are exhausted to the limit and you 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.840
 break camp far away in the marshes 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:49.979
 many of the lands you captured are already possible 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.610
 are you against 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:05:05.190

00:04:53.610 --> 00:05:06.870
