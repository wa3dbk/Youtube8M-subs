and they are not gonna have any love I

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.620 
and they are not gonna have any love I
mean<00:03:02.190> we're<00:03:02.670> gonna<00:03:02.760> have<00:03:02.940> somebody<00:03:03.120> come<00:03:03.390> over

mean we're gonna have somebody come over

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.259 
mean we're gonna have somebody come over
and<00:03:03.870> feed<00:03:04.200> them<00:03:04.410> and<00:03:05.130> do<00:03:05.310> all<00:03:05.459> that<00:03:05.489> but<00:03:05.820> they

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
and feed them and do all that but they

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.030 
and feed them and do all that but they
probably<00:03:06.510> won't<00:03:06.690> want<00:03:06.810> to<00:03:06.930> touch<00:03:07.110> them<00:03:07.350> bring

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
probably won't want to touch them bring

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.940 
probably won't want to touch them bring
them<00:03:08.160> out<00:03:08.310> love<00:03:08.610> them<00:03:08.790> or<00:03:09.000> anything<00:03:09.230> so<00:03:10.230> I<00:03:10.590> just

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
them out love them or anything so I just

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.229 
them out love them or anything so I just
made<00:03:11.340> that<00:03:11.459> for<00:03:11.610> them<00:03:11.730> that's<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:12.030> main

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
made that for them that's the main

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:13.640 
made that for them that's the main
reason<00:03:12.269> but<00:03:12.780> another<00:03:13.080> reason<00:03:13.170> it's<00:03:13.590> just

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
reason but another reason it's just

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.190 
reason but another reason it's just
because<00:03:13.950> I<00:03:14.070> love<00:03:14.220> my<00:03:14.280> big<00:03:14.549> so<00:03:14.730> much<00:03:14.940> and<00:03:15.200> I

like is that we kind of moved the boxes

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.460 
like is that we kind of moved the boxes
away<00:03:44.670> and<00:03:45.030> just<00:03:45.360> turn<00:03:45.630> them<00:03:45.780> over<00:03:45.900> so<00:03:46.290> that<00:03:46.320> I

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
away and just turn them over so that I

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.800 
away and just turn them over so that I
can<00:03:46.650> have<00:03:46.860> some<00:03:47.040> storage<00:03:47.480> just<00:03:48.480> so<00:03:48.690> much
