getting started first thing you'll see
here<00:00:17.340> is<00:00:17.490> one<00:00:18.270> transmitter<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:19.170> three

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
here is one transmitter and three

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.730 
here is one transmitter and three
receivers<00:00:20.240> this<00:00:21.240> transmitter<00:00:21.720> is<00:00:22.080> capable<00:00:22.439> of

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
receivers this transmitter is capable of

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.050 
receivers this transmitter is capable of
controlling<00:00:23.220> each<00:00:24.029> individual<00:00:24.800> receiver<00:00:26.060> now

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
controlling each individual receiver now

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.450 
controlling each individual receiver now
the<00:00:27.150> first<00:00:27.330> thing<00:00:27.480> we<00:00:27.660> need<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.869> do<00:00:28.109> is<00:00:28.460> pair

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
the first thing we need to do is pair

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.150 
the first thing we need to do is pair
the<00:00:29.939> transmitter<00:00:30.449> which<00:00:30.929> with<00:00:31.650> each<00:00:31.890> of<00:00:32.099> the

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
the transmitter which with each of the

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.610 
the transmitter which with each of the
receivers<00:00:32.640> in<00:00:33.510> order<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:33.930> do<00:00:34.110> this<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.410> first

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
receivers in order to do this the first

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.110 
receivers in order to do this the first
thing<00:00:34.770> we<00:00:34.860> need<00:00:34.980> to<00:00:35.040> do<00:00:35.280> is<00:00:35.550> turn<00:00:35.730> on<00:00:35.790> the

thing we need to do is turn on the

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.180 
thing we need to do is turn on the
transmitter<00:00:36.239> and<00:00:36.870> we<00:00:37.140> can<00:00:37.260> do<00:00:37.410> that<00:00:37.590> by

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
transmitter and we can do that by

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.049 
transmitter and we can do that by
hitting<00:00:38.399> any<00:00:38.640> button<00:00:40.430> okay<00:00:41.430> now<00:00:41.670> as<00:00:41.820> you<00:00:41.940> can
