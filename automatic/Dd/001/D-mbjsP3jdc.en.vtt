00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:13.280 
alright folks well it took a fair amount

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.920 
alright folks well it took a fair amount
of<00:00:13.490> work<00:00:13.730> but<00:00:14.390> da<00:00:15.110> da<00:00:16.150> yeah<00:00:17.150> so<00:00:17.480> not<00:00:17.630> only<00:00:17.720> did<00:00:17.840> I

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:17.930 
of work but da da yeah so not only did I

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:19.780 
of work but da da yeah so not only did I
finish<00:00:18.320> the<00:00:18.530> room<00:00:18.740> as<00:00:19.010> and<00:00:19.189> I<00:00:19.250> added<00:00:19.610> a<00:00:19.670> bunch

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:19.790 
finish the room as and I added a bunch

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:21.250 
finish the room as and I added a bunch
of<00:00:19.910> stuff<00:00:19.970> but<00:00:20.240> I<00:00:20.300> actually<00:00:20.510> did<00:00:20.810> the<00:00:20.930> sorting

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.260 
of stuff but I actually did the sorting

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.380 
of stuff but I actually did the sorting
system<00:00:21.590> as<00:00:21.710> well<00:00:21.890> ended<00:00:22.580> up<00:00:22.640> being<00:00:22.700> way<00:00:23.029> easier

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
system as well ended up being way easier

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.000 
system as well ended up being way easier
than<00:00:23.420> I<00:00:23.570> thought<00:00:23.599> I<00:00:23.930> use<00:00:24.080> this<00:00:24.260> mod<00:00:24.500> refined

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.010 
than I thought I use this mod refined

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.940 
than I thought I use this mod refined
from<00:00:25.130> location<00:00:25.640> these<00:00:26.480> relocator<00:00:27.050> czar<00:00:27.380> super

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:27.950 
from location these relocator czar super

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.159 
from location these relocator czar super
cool<00:00:28.130> they're<00:00:28.910> sort<00:00:29.599> of<00:00:29.660> like<00:00:29.720> red<00:00:29.989> power

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:30.169 
cool they're sort of like red power

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:32.019 
cool they're sort of like red power
pipes<00:00:30.439> so<00:00:31.099> we<00:00:31.189> step<00:00:31.400> back<00:00:31.430> here<00:00:31.759> and<00:00:31.849> we<00:00:31.910> can

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
pipes so we step back here and we can

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:34.240 
pipes so we step back here and we can
just<00:00:32.060> see<00:00:32.450> that<00:00:32.750> it's<00:00:33.380> a<00:00:33.470> really<00:00:33.650> simple<00:00:34.010> pipe

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
just see that it's a really simple pipe

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.100 
just see that it's a really simple pipe
network<00:00:34.640> and<00:00:34.850> it<00:00:34.910> just<00:00:35.090> routes<00:00:35.300> closest<00:00:35.900> first

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
network and it just routes closest first

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.479 
network and it just routes closest first
and<00:00:36.380> there's<00:00:36.500> all<00:00:36.620> sorts<00:00:36.890> of<00:00:36.950> stuff<00:00:37.010> you<00:00:37.340> can

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
and there's all sorts of stuff you can

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.300 
and there's all sorts of stuff you can
do<00:00:37.989> you'll<00:00:38.989> note<00:00:39.200> that<00:00:39.230> a<00:00:39.380> few<00:00:39.590> of<00:00:39.710> these<00:00:39.860> like

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:40.310 
do you'll note that a few of these like

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.310 
do you'll note that a few of these like
this<00:00:40.489> one<00:00:40.670> don't<00:00:41.420> have<00:00:41.720> you<00:00:42.050> know<00:00:42.140> it<00:00:42.200> doesn't

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
this one don't have you know it doesn't

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.160 
this one don't have you know it doesn't
connect<00:00:42.739> because<00:00:42.980> there<00:00:43.370> is<00:00:43.550> no<00:00:43.960> module<00:00:44.960> in

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
connect because there is no module in

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:46.869 
connect because there is no module in
there<00:00:45.379> and<00:00:45.559> if<00:00:45.949> we<00:00:46.070> just<00:00:46.250> I<00:00:46.340> just<00:00:46.370> saved<00:00:46.730> this

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
there and if we just I just saved this

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:48.430 
there and if we just I just saved this
because<00:00:47.210> there's<00:00:47.390> a<00:00:47.449> few<00:00:47.809> more<00:00:47.930> modules<00:00:48.320> we

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
because there's a few more modules we

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.540 
because there's a few more modules we
can<00:00:48.559> just<00:00:48.679> toss<00:00:48.859> in<00:00:49.070> and<00:00:49.219> these<00:00:49.309> are<00:00:49.429> just

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 
can just toss in and these are just

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.880 
can just toss in and these are just
overflow<00:00:50.090> modules<00:00:50.539> right<00:00:50.750> so<00:00:51.260> this<00:00:51.410> one<00:00:51.590> here

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
overflow modules right so this one here

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.270 
overflow modules right so this one here
just<00:00:52.280> goes<00:00:52.609> right<00:00:52.879> there<00:00:53.510> and<00:00:54.100> congrats<00:00:55.100> we

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
just goes right there and congrats we

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.189 
just goes right there and congrats we
have<00:00:55.460> access<00:00:55.820> to<00:00:55.940> that<00:00:56.030> and<00:00:56.269> this<00:00:56.839> one<00:00:57.050> could

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
have access to that and this one could

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.740 
have access to that and this one could
also<00:00:57.350> use<00:00:57.500> one<00:00:57.859> too<00:00:58.039> just<00:00:58.969> like<00:00:59.420> this<00:00:59.570> I've

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
also use one too just like this I've

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.110 
also use one too just like this I've
been<00:00:59.839> pairing<00:01:00.230> them<00:01:00.410> and<00:01:00.679> naming<00:01:01.609> them<00:01:01.850> and

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
been pairing them and naming them and

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.140 
been pairing them and naming them and
put<00:01:02.749> applying<00:01:03.199> filters<00:01:03.820> let<00:01:04.820> me<00:01:04.879> just<00:01:05.000> go

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
put applying filters let me just go

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:06.850 
put applying filters let me just go
ahead<00:01:05.269> and<00:01:05.420> pull<00:01:05.720> out<00:01:05.750> the<00:01:06.050> machines<00:01:06.500> filter

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
ahead and pull out the machines filter

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.590 
ahead and pull out the machines filter
one<00:01:07.010> of<00:01:07.100> the<00:01:07.160> most<00:01:07.310> complicated<00:01:07.670> to<00:01:08.300> show<00:01:08.540> you

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
one of the most complicated to show you

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.890 
one of the most complicated to show you
what's<00:01:08.960> up<00:01:10.630> so<00:01:11.630> it<00:01:11.930> goes<00:01:12.050> like<00:01:12.110> this<00:01:13.420> mods<00:01:14.420> are

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
what's up so it goes like this mods are

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.130 
what's up so it goes like this mods are
on<00:01:15.250> and/or<00:01:16.250> dicked<00:01:16.550> matching<00:01:17.000> is<00:01:17.120> off<00:01:17.420> but<00:01:18.050> you

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
on and/or dicked matching is off but you

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.330 
on and/or dicked matching is off but you
can<00:01:18.260> do<00:01:18.320> all<00:01:18.350> sorts<00:01:18.410> of<00:01:18.560> stuff<00:01:18.620> so<00:01:18.860> this<00:01:18.980> is<00:01:19.100> mod

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
can do all sorts of stuff so this is mod

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.860 
can do all sorts of stuff so this is mod
matching<00:01:19.790> white<00:01:20.000> list<00:01:20.240> and<00:01:20.420> it<00:01:20.480> says<00:01:20.660> only

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:20.870 
matching white list and it says only

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.780 
matching white list and it says only
things<00:01:21.230> that<00:01:21.440> come<00:01:21.590> from<00:01:21.740> these<00:01:21.950> mods<00:01:22.280> can<00:01:22.640> go

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
things that come from these mods can go

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.290 
things that come from these mods can go
in<00:01:23.000> now<00:01:23.620> unfortunately<00:01:24.620> it's<00:01:25.460> difficult<00:01:25.970> to

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:26.300 
in now unfortunately it's difficult to

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.420 
in now unfortunately it's difficult to
actually<00:01:26.510> have<00:01:27.020> more<00:01:27.860> than<00:01:28.040> one<00:01:28.220> of<00:01:28.310> these

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:28.430 
actually have more than one of these

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.510 
actually have more than one of these
slots<00:01:28.700> only<00:01:28.970> room<00:01:29.120> for<00:01:29.330> one<00:01:29.360> but<00:01:30.160> the<00:01:31.160> nice

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
slots only room for one but the nice

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.810 
slots only room for one but the nice
part<00:01:31.850> about<00:01:31.910> it<00:01:32.090> is<00:01:32.270> that<00:01:33.100> what<00:01:34.100> we<00:01:34.310> can<00:01:34.550> do

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
part about it is that what we can do

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.210 
part about it is that what we can do
with<00:01:35.030> that<00:01:35.090> is<00:01:35.570> actually<00:01:36.170> have<00:01:36.380> the<00:01:36.890> remote

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
with that is actually have the remote

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.730 
with that is actually have the remote
modules<00:01:37.730> multiple<00:01:38.450> input<00:01:38.870> points<00:01:39.200> if<00:01:39.320> we<00:01:39.530> need

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
modules multiple input points if we need

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.830 
modules multiple input points if we need
them<00:01:39.770> with<00:01:40.400> multiple<00:01:40.730> filters<00:01:41.060> so<00:01:41.390> it's<00:01:41.540> not

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
them with multiple filters so it's not

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.050 
them with multiple filters so it's not
the<00:01:42.020> best<00:01:42.230> solution<00:01:42.440> to<00:01:43.010> little<00:01:43.280> kludgy<00:01:43.610> but

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
the best solution to little kludgy but

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.170 
the best solution to little kludgy but
it<00:01:44.150> works<00:01:44.330> and<00:01:44.570> of<00:01:45.170> course<00:01:45.230> back<00:01:45.680> here<00:01:45.950> is<00:01:46.180> just

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
it works and of course back here is just

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.210 
it works and of course back here is just
our<00:01:47.330> power<00:01:47.600> dispersing<00:01:48.590> network<00:01:48.860> it's<00:01:49.040> kind

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
our power dispersing network it's kind

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.740 
our power dispersing network it's kind
of<00:01:49.250> smaller<00:01:49.610> will<00:01:49.880> put<00:01:50.000> other<00:01:50.210> stuff<00:01:50.330> in<00:01:50.630> here

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
of smaller will put other stuff in here

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.060 
of smaller will put other stuff in here
as<00:01:50.870> we<00:01:50.960> go<00:01:51.110> on<00:01:51.140> I<00:01:51.320> think<00:01:51.590> this<00:01:51.680> is<00:01:51.830> a<00:01:51.860> pretty

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
as we go on I think this is a pretty

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.460 
as we go on I think this is a pretty
good<00:01:52.340> like<00:01:53.180> relay<00:01:53.600> station<00:01:54.020> for<00:01:54.200> power<00:01:54.320> and

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
good like relay station for power and

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.200 
good like relay station for power and
we're<00:01:54.740> constantly<00:01:55.130> consuming<00:01:55.580> power<00:01:55.850> but

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:56.210 
we're constantly consuming power but

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.570 
we're constantly consuming power but
we're<00:01:56.690> making<00:01:56.810> so<00:01:57.230> much<00:01:57.500> right<00:01:58.100> that<00:01:58.400> it

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
we're making so much right that it

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.790 
we're making so much right that it
pretty<00:01:59.120> much<00:01:59.300> doesn't<00:01:59.570> matter<00:01:59.840> like<00:02:00.200> really

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
pretty much doesn't matter like really

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.620 
pretty much doesn't matter like really
the<00:02:01.010> main<00:02:01.190> limitation<00:02:02.000> right<00:02:02.300> now<00:02:02.510> is<00:02:02.780> this

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
the main limitation right now is this

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:07.360 
the main limitation right now is this
medium<00:02:05.630> voltage<00:02:05.810> wire<00:02:06.320> and<00:02:06.620> the<00:02:06.710> losses<00:02:07.010> we

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
medium voltage wire and the losses we

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.639 
medium voltage wire and the losses we
get<00:02:07.550> along<00:02:07.790> this<00:02:07.940> very<00:02:08.209> long<00:02:08.569> line<00:02:08.989> leading

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
get along this very long line leading

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.890 
get along this very long line leading
all<00:02:09.890> the<00:02:09.920> way<00:02:10.099> over<00:02:10.429> here<00:02:10.459> so<00:02:11.360> then<00:02:11.629> you<00:02:11.750> can

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
all the way over here so then you can

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.110 
all the way over here so then you can
see<00:02:12.080> I<00:02:12.110> took<00:02:12.260> the<00:02:12.769> old<00:02:12.920> ender<00:02:13.280> chests<00:02:13.790> used

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
see I took the old ender chests used

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.940 
see I took the old ender chests used
from<00:02:14.360> the<00:02:14.510> other<00:02:14.720> or<00:02:15.019> processing<00:02:15.620> system

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
from the other or processing system

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.250 
from the other or processing system
which<00:02:16.069> is<00:02:16.190> currently<00:02:16.400> disconnected<00:02:16.670> and<00:02:17.260> I've

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
which is currently disconnected and I've

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.950 
which is currently disconnected and I've
put<00:02:18.560> it<00:02:18.680> over<00:02:18.890> here<00:02:19.400> now<00:02:19.910> we<00:02:20.360> can<00:02:20.510> actually<00:02:20.630> add

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
put it over here now we can actually add

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.530 
put it over here now we can actually add
some<00:02:21.230> diverting<00:02:21.890> points<00:02:22.310> here<00:02:22.880> so<00:02:23.210> eventually

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
some diverting points here so eventually

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.430 
some diverting points here so eventually
what<00:02:23.780> we<00:02:23.870> could<00:02:24.020> do

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
what we could do

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.020 
what we could do
is<00:02:24.590> maybe<00:02:25.370> actually<00:02:26.060> add<00:02:26.360> or<00:02:26.830> a<00:02:27.830> route<00:02:28.430> to<00:02:28.820> or

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
is maybe actually add or a route to or

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.120 
is maybe actually add or a route to or
processing<00:02:29.720> from<00:02:30.350> here<00:02:30.710> which<00:02:30.890> would<00:02:31.010> be

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
processing from here which would be

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.290 
processing from here which would be
pretty<00:02:31.310> slick<00:02:31.580> because<00:02:31.700> right<00:02:31.940> now<00:02:31.970> we<00:02:32.120> just

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
pretty slick because right now we just

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.610 
pretty slick because right now we just
have<00:02:32.360> this<00:02:32.510> bag<00:02:32.750> right<00:02:33.080> and<00:02:33.200> we<00:02:33.260> can<00:02:33.380> just<00:02:33.470> go

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
have this bag right and we can just go

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.140 
have this bag right and we can just go
boo<00:02:34.250> boo<00:02:34.280> boo<00:02:34.490> and<00:02:34.520> we<00:02:34.700> can<00:02:34.820> toss<00:02:34.940> something

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
boo boo boo and we can toss something

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.970 
boo boo boo and we can toss something
and<00:02:35.390> so<00:02:35.480> for<00:02:35.630> example<00:02:35.690> this<00:02:36.410> looks<00:02:36.590> pretty<00:02:36.740> fun

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
and so for example this looks pretty fun

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.010 
and so for example this looks pretty fun
let's<00:02:37.430> toss<00:02:37.670> in<00:02:37.880> some<00:02:37.910> redstone<00:02:38.270> right<00:02:38.810> we

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
let's toss in some redstone right we

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.140 
let's toss in some redstone right we
could<00:02:39.140> see<00:02:39.410> that<00:02:39.950> I'll<00:02:40.130> get<00:02:40.280> shuffled<00:02:40.550> off<00:02:40.790> and

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
could see that I'll get shuffled off and

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.270 
could see that I'll get shuffled off and
if<00:02:41.630> we<00:02:41.780> follow<00:02:42.020> it<00:02:42.140> it'll<00:02:42.440> actually<00:02:42.590> get<00:02:42.950> sent

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
if we follow it it'll actually get sent

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.560 
if we follow it it'll actually get sent
down<00:02:43.310> to<00:02:43.460> the<00:02:43.670> closest<00:02:43.970> point<00:02:44.090> which<00:02:44.270> is<00:02:44.300> this

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
down to the closest point which is this

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:47.410 
down to the closest point which is this
one<00:02:44.750> which<00:02:45.620> is<00:02:45.680> metals<00:02:46.520> jams<00:02:46.850> courts<00:02:47.300> and

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
one which is metals jams courts and

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.760 
one which is metals jams courts and
redstone<00:02:47.660> right<00:02:48.050> and<00:02:48.200> we<00:02:48.260> can<00:02:48.380> see<00:02:48.500> that<00:02:48.590> we

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
redstone right and we can see that we

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.340 
redstone right and we can see that we
got<00:02:48.890> a<00:02:49.070> ton<00:02:49.340> of<00:02:49.550> stuff<00:02:49.970> now<00:02:50.690> let<00:02:51.170> me<00:02:51.200> go

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
got a ton of stuff now let me go

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.380 
got a ton of stuff now let me go
upstairs<00:02:51.740> and<00:02:51.860> I<00:02:52.070> will<00:02:52.220> show<00:02:52.250> you<00:02:52.490> exactly<00:02:52.880> how

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
upstairs and I will show you exactly how

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.240 
upstairs and I will show you exactly how
this<00:02:53.570> is<00:02:53.900> going<00:02:54.140> to<00:02:54.440> work<00:02:54.620> because<00:02:54.980> it's

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
this is going to work because it's

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.490 
this is going to work because it's
pretty<00:02:55.490> funny<00:02:58.780> had<00:02:59.780> a<00:02:59.810> bit<00:02:59.960> of<00:02:59.990> a<00:03:00.080> server<00:03:00.320> issue

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
pretty funny had a bit of a server issue

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.840 
pretty funny had a bit of a server issue
there<00:03:00.830> which<00:03:01.010> would<00:03:01.190> have<00:03:01.250> probably<00:03:01.490> heard

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
there which would have probably heard

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.210 
there which would have probably heard
this<00:03:02.060> okay<00:03:02.360> but<00:03:02.570> it's<00:03:02.690> all<00:03:02.780> fixed<00:03:03.220> admin

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
this okay but it's all fixed admin

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.040 
this okay but it's all fixed admin
duties<00:03:04.310> are<00:03:04.580> done<00:03:04.610> so<00:03:05.030> I've<00:03:05.360> got<00:03:05.720> a<00:03:05.750> floating

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.050 
duties are done so I've got a floating

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.510 
duties are done so I've got a floating
on<00:03:06.170> the<00:03:06.230> floating<00:03:06.440> hopper<00:03:06.650> Hawk<00:03:06.920> here<00:03:07.160> really

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
on the floating hopper Hawk here really

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.160 
on the floating hopper Hawk here really
fun<00:03:07.700> thing<00:03:07.910> and<00:03:08.030> that<00:03:08.510> ender<00:03:08.720> chest<00:03:08.750> that<00:03:09.080> you

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
fun thing and that ender chest that you

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.260 
fun thing and that ender chest that you
saw<00:03:09.350> below<00:03:09.650> right<00:03:10.520> do<00:03:10.880> you<00:03:10.970> know<00:03:11.090> what<00:03:11.210> I'm

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:11.270 
saw below right do you know what I'm

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:14.770 
saw below right do you know what I'm
going<00:03:11.360> to<00:03:11.420> do<00:03:11.680> I'm<00:03:12.680> going<00:03:12.740> to<00:03:13.700> throw<00:03:14.330> things<00:03:14.570> on

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
going to do I'm going to throw things on

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.310 
going to do I'm going to throw things on
the<00:03:14.960> ground<00:03:15.050> that's<00:03:15.830> right<00:03:16.010> in<00:03:16.250> fact<00:03:16.810> it<00:03:17.810> might

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
the ground that's right in fact it might

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.390 
the ground that's right in fact it might
be<00:03:18.500> funny<00:03:18.770> to<00:03:18.860> just<00:03:19.670> break<00:03:20.060> it<00:03:20.240> you<00:03:20.960> know

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
be funny to just break it you know

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.350 
be funny to just break it you know
because<00:03:22.400> we<00:03:22.640> could<00:03:22.760> just<00:03:22.880> do<00:03:23.060> we<00:03:23.120> could<00:03:23.240> just

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
because we could just do we could just

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.450 
because we could just do we could just
toss<00:03:23.540> things<00:03:23.930> in<00:03:24.440> they'll<00:03:24.950> just<00:03:25.130> go<00:03:25.280> to<00:03:25.340> the

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:25.460 
toss things in they'll just go to the

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.700 
toss things in they'll just go to the
right<00:03:25.610> places<00:03:25.940> it<00:03:26.420> doesn't<00:03:26.450> even<00:03:27.080> matter<00:03:27.350> and

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:27.710 
right places it doesn't even matter and

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.560 
right places it doesn't even matter and
the<00:03:28.250> hopper<00:03:28.520> hawk<00:03:28.700> is<00:03:28.850> just<00:03:29.090> sort<00:03:29.239> of<00:03:29.270> shoving

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
the hopper hawk is just sort of shoving

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:30.640 
the hopper hawk is just sort of shoving
things<00:03:29.720> in<00:03:29.900> there<00:03:29.959> right<00:03:30.230> and<00:03:30.380> it's<00:03:30.500> going<00:03:30.590> to

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
things in there right and it's going to

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.280 
things in there right and it's going to
keep<00:03:30.800> up<00:03:30.980> pretty<00:03:31.310> fast<00:03:31.489> so<00:03:31.850> you<00:03:32.750> know<00:03:32.870> we<00:03:33.140> could

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
keep up pretty fast so you know we could

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.550 
keep up pretty fast so you know we could
like<00:03:33.670> break<00:03:34.670> this<00:03:34.940> what<00:03:35.180> the<00:03:35.330> maybe<00:03:35.540> this<00:03:35.870> that

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
like break this what the maybe this that

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.310 
like break this what the maybe this that
and<00:03:37.330> just<00:03:38.330> toss<00:03:38.570> this<00:03:38.780> on<00:03:38.900> the<00:03:38.989> ground<00:03:39.170> who

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320 
and just toss this on the ground who

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.900 
and just toss this on the ground who
knows<00:03:39.470> what<00:03:39.620> that'll<00:03:39.800> end<00:03:39.920> up<00:03:40.070> it'll<00:03:40.430> be<00:03:40.610> in

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
knows what that'll end up it'll be in

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.390 
knows what that'll end up it'll be in
the<00:03:41.420> system<00:03:41.450> in<00:03:41.930> fact<00:03:42.530> I<00:03:42.709> sort<00:03:42.980> of<00:03:43.070> wonder<00:03:43.280> what

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
the system in fact I sort of wonder what

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.300 
the system in fact I sort of wonder what
would<00:03:43.489> happen<00:03:43.700> if<00:03:44.200> we<00:03:45.200> were<00:03:45.320> to<00:03:45.410> say<00:03:45.650> break

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
would happen if we were to say break

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:54.430 
would happen if we were to say break
this<00:03:47.470> well<00:03:48.470> that<00:03:48.590> work<00:03:50.350> it<00:03:51.350> did<00:03:51.620> I<00:03:53.350> bet<00:03:54.350> you

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
this well that work it did I bet you

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.620 
this well that work it did I bet you
looks<00:03:54.590> really<00:03:54.890> cool<00:03:55.070> down<00:03:55.220> there<00:03:55.400> so<00:03:55.790> yeah

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
looks really cool down there so yeah

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.479 
looks really cool down there so yeah
like<00:03:57.019> in<00:03:57.260> theory<00:03:57.650> we<00:03:57.680> could<00:03:57.890> just<00:03:58.220> break<00:03:58.630> this

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
like in theory we could just break this

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:06.370 
like in theory we could just break this
and<00:04:02.170> all<00:04:03.170> of<00:04:03.500> it<00:04:03.590> will<00:04:03.739> go<00:04:03.920> away<00:04:05.140> look<00:04:06.140> at<00:04:06.230> that

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
and all of it will go away look at that

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.820 
and all of it will go away look at that
how<00:04:07.160> cool<00:04:07.220> is<00:04:07.519> this<00:04:08.200> let's<00:04:09.200> run<00:04:09.410> down<00:04:09.440> and<00:04:09.739> see

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
how cool is this let's run down and see

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.699 
how cool is this let's run down and see
that<00:04:09.980> happen<00:04:10.630> yep<00:04:11.630> there<00:04:11.870> we<00:04:11.959> go<00:04:12.080> now<00:04:12.350> one<00:04:12.530> cool

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
that happen yep there we go now one cool

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:14.050 
that happen yep there we go now one cool
thing<00:04:12.739> about<00:04:12.980> the<00:04:13.220> systems<00:04:13.550> you<00:04:13.670> can<00:04:13.700> set<00:04:13.940> the

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
thing about the systems you can set the

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.509 
thing about the systems you can set the
minimum<00:04:14.239> stack<00:04:14.630> size<00:04:14.870> so<00:04:15.260> if<00:04:15.530> we<00:04:15.680> shift<00:04:16.190> click

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519 
minimum stack size so if we shift click

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.000 
minimum stack size so if we shift click
we<00:04:17.150> can<00:04:17.299> make<00:04:17.600> this<00:04:17.720> go<00:04:17.900> faster<00:04:17.930> you<00:04:18.739> can<00:04:18.769> see

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
we can make this go faster you can see

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:20.620 
we can make this go faster you can see
now<00:04:19.160> that<00:04:19.190> it's<00:04:19.459> actually<00:04:19.580> pulling<00:04:19.880> out<00:04:20.000> 64<00:04:20.540> at

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:20.630 
now that it's actually pulling out 64 at

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.990 
now that it's actually pulling out 64 at
a<00:04:20.690> time<00:04:20.870> as<00:04:21.049> opposed<00:04:21.290> to<00:04:21.410> 16<00:04:21.739> the<00:04:22.550> hopper<00:04:22.820> hawk

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:23.000 
a time as opposed to 16 the hopper hawk

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.430 
a time as opposed to 16 the hopper hawk
is<00:04:23.150> the<00:04:23.270> primary<00:04:23.540> limitation<00:04:23.870> here<00:04:24.260> because

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
is the primary limitation here because

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.500 
is the primary limitation here because
it<00:04:24.530> only<00:04:24.650> moves<00:04:24.830> things<00:04:25.040> in<00:04:25.250> groups<00:04:25.370> of<00:04:25.580> 16<00:04:25.940> but

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
it only moves things in groups of 16 but

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:29.710 
it only moves things in groups of 16 but
now<00:04:26.660> we<00:04:26.720> can<00:04:26.960> actually<00:04:27.110> pull<00:04:27.410> out<00:04:27.530> 64<00:04:28.130> and<00:04:28.720> we

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
now we can actually pull out 64 and we

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.800 
now we can actually pull out 64 and we
can<00:04:29.930> set<00:04:30.169> this<00:04:30.320> to<00:04:30.560> like<00:04:31.240> one<00:04:32.240> second<00:04:32.630> between

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
can set this to like one second between

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.469 
can set this to like one second between
extractions<00:04:33.410> to<00:04:33.620> be<00:04:33.770> nice<00:04:34.010> on<00:04:34.190> the<00:04:34.280> server<00:04:34.490> but

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479 
extractions to be nice on the server but

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:37.510 
extractions to be nice on the server but
this<00:04:36.410> is<00:04:36.560> just<00:04:36.590> a<00:04:36.740> right-click<00:04:36.890> by<00:04:37.160> the<00:04:37.220> way<00:04:37.340> in

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
this is just a right-click by the way in

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.990 
this is just a right-click by the way in
the

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
the

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.370 
the
time<00:04:38.210> we're<00:04:38.300> going<00:04:38.390> to<00:04:38.450> stay<00:04:38.630> at<00:04:38.690> half<00:04:39.260> a

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
time we're going to stay at half a

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.900 
time we're going to stay at half a
second<00:04:39.710> just<00:04:39.830> to<00:04:39.950> quickly<00:04:40.370> get<00:04:40.670> through<00:04:40.820> the

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
second just to quickly get through the

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.370 
second just to quickly get through the
sorting<00:04:41.240> so<00:04:41.660> all<00:04:41.780> I<00:04:41.810> have<00:04:42.020> to<00:04:42.110> do<00:04:42.230> now

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
sorting so all I have to do now

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:43.990 
sorting so all I have to do now
basically<00:04:42.740> is<00:04:42.950> just<00:04:42.980> break<00:04:43.370> stuff<00:04:43.640> and<00:04:43.850> let

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
basically is just break stuff and let

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.280 
basically is just break stuff and let
the<00:04:44.120> system<00:04:44.270> sort<00:04:44.600> itself<00:04:44.720> out<00:04:45.020> there's

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.290 
the system sort itself out there's

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.350 
the system sort itself out there's
overflow<00:04:45.710> chests<00:04:46.100> involved<00:04:46.610> so<00:04:46.820> there's

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
overflow chests involved so there's

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:48.580 
overflow chests involved so there's
really<00:04:47.510> no<00:04:47.750> since<00:04:48.020> there's<00:04:48.140> so<00:04:48.200> much<00:04:48.320> more

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
really no since there's so much more

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:49.900 
really no since there's so much more
capacity<00:04:48.890> than<00:04:49.190> our<00:04:49.370> current<00:04:49.550> storage

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
capacity than our current storage

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.420 
capacity than our current storage
there's<00:04:50.570> really<00:04:50.750> no<00:04:50.990> risk<00:04:51.320> here<00:04:51.740> right<00:04:51.980> it's

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
there's really no risk here right it's

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:57.460 
there's really no risk here right it's
going<00:04:52.550> to<00:04:52.610> work<00:04:56.080> it's<00:04:57.080> just<00:04:57.230> kind<00:04:57.380> of<00:04:57.410> fun

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
going to work it's just kind of fun

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.670 
going to work it's just kind of fun
actually<00:04:58.780> this<00:04:59.780> is<00:04:59.930> actually<00:05:00.110> really<00:05:00.290> fun

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
actually this is actually really fun

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.130 
actually this is actually really fun
like<00:05:01.250> it's<00:05:01.460> just<00:05:01.730> it's<00:05:02.570> just<00:05:02.660> going<00:05:02.900> to<00:05:02.960> work

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.140 
like it's just it's just going to work

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:04.360 
like it's just it's just going to work
out<00:05:03.440> we<00:05:03.590> can't<00:05:03.770> we<00:05:03.890> do<00:05:03.980> have<00:05:04.100> to<00:05:04.160> be<00:05:04.220> a<00:05:04.250> little

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
out we can't we do have to be a little

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:05.710 
out we can't we do have to be a little
bit<00:05:04.490> careful<00:05:04.580> about<00:05:04.790> things<00:05:05.120> up<00:05:05.420> and<00:05:05.600> down

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
bit careful about things up and down

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:09.250 
bit careful about things up and down
over<00:05:06.080> there<00:05:06.200> but<00:05:07.040> yeah<00:05:07.910> I<00:05:07.940> mean<00:05:08.180> have<00:05:09.080> you<00:05:09.200> ever

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
over there but yeah I mean have you ever

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.200 
over there but yeah I mean have you ever
fed<00:05:09.950> your<00:05:10.070> sorting<00:05:10.340> system<00:05:10.669> this<00:05:10.790> way<00:05:10.910> I<00:05:11.120> never

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
fed your sorting system this way I never

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.890 
fed your sorting system this way I never
have<00:05:11.980> just<00:05:12.980> toss<00:05:13.190> these<00:05:13.490> gold<00:05:13.790> nuggets<00:05:14.240> in<00:05:14.480> who

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:14.900 
have just toss these gold nuggets in who

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.000 
have just toss these gold nuggets in who
cares<00:05:15.200> they're<00:05:15.440> all<00:05:15.530> going<00:05:15.620> to<00:05:15.710> end<00:05:15.800> up<00:05:15.890> in

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010 
cares they're all going to end up in

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.190 
cares they're all going to end up in
there<00:05:16.190> and<00:05:16.370> we<00:05:17.360> can<00:05:17.480> just<00:05:17.510> watch<00:05:17.720> the<00:05:17.900> system

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:18.200 
there and we can just watch the system

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.659 
there and we can just watch the system
who<00:05:18.380> just<00:05:18.680> rip<00:05:19.010> right<00:05:19.160> through<00:05:19.190> it<00:05:19.430> now<00:05:19.520> that

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:19.669 
who just rip right through it now that

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:23.260 
who just rip right through it now that

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:24.950 
time and now let's just go down there

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:26.500 
time and now let's just go down there
you<00:05:25.190> know<00:05:25.310> and<00:05:25.550> be<00:05:25.820> comfortable<00:05:26.180> with<00:05:26.390> what

you know and be comfortable with what

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:27.909 
you know and be comfortable with what
we're<00:05:26.630> seeing<00:05:26.810> here<00:05:26.960> because<00:05:27.260> all<00:05:27.410> our<00:05:27.470> metal

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:27.919 
we're seeing here because all our metal

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:30.340 
we're seeing here because all our metal
is<00:05:28.010> in<00:05:28.100> the<00:05:28.160> system<00:05:28.310> now<00:05:28.490> right<00:05:28.970> if<00:05:29.690> we<00:05:29.810> go<00:05:29.900> here

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:30.350 
is in the system now right if we go here

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.530 
is in the system now right if we go here
just<00:05:30.620> right-click<00:05:30.919> we<00:05:31.010> can<00:05:31.160> see<00:05:31.400> tons<00:05:32.180> and

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:32.540 
just right-click we can see tons and

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:34.659 
just right-click we can see tons and
tons<00:05:32.720> and<00:05:32.930> tons<00:05:33.140> of<00:05:33.380> metal<00:05:33.590> it's<00:05:34.460> kind<00:05:34.640> of

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:34.669 
tons and tons of metal it's kind of

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:35.860 
tons and tons of metal it's kind of
interesting<00:05:34.850> to<00:05:35.090> see<00:05:35.270> it<00:05:35.360> this<00:05:35.480> way<00:05:35.690> as

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 
interesting to see it this way as

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.690 
interesting to see it this way as
opposed<00:05:36.230> to<00:05:36.380> in<00:05:36.470> a<00:05:36.530> barrel<00:05:36.830> I<00:05:36.950> I<00:05:37.100> wouldn't<00:05:37.610> have

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:37.700 
opposed to in a barrel I I wouldn't have

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.040 
opposed to in a barrel I I wouldn't have
thought<00:05:37.790> of<00:05:37.940> it<00:05:37.970> this<00:05:38.090> way<00:05:38.270> it<00:05:38.810> looks<00:05:38.990> like

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050 
thought of it this way it looks like

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.100 
thought of it this way it looks like
less<00:05:39.320> than<00:05:39.470> it<00:05:39.590> is<00:05:39.710> doesn't<00:05:40.430> it<00:05:40.490> I<00:05:40.840> mean<00:05:41.840> that

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
less than it is doesn't it I mean that

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.380 
less than it is doesn't it I mean that
was<00:05:42.229> like<00:05:42.260> a<00:05:42.740> lot<00:05:43.220> and<00:05:43.820> we<00:05:43.910> could<00:05:44.030> even<00:05:44.150> go<00:05:44.270> like

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:44.390 
was like a lot and we could even go like

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:49.960 
was like a lot and we could even go like
this<00:05:44.680> I<00:05:45.790> think<00:05:46.790> we<00:05:46.880> can<00:05:47.030> show<00:05:47.240> groups<00:05:48.460> I<00:05:49.460> think

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:49.970 
this I think we can show groups I think

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:51.190 
this I think we can show groups I think
we<00:05:50.030> can<00:05:50.150> actually<00:05:50.240> make<00:05:50.510> it<00:05:50.600> go<00:05:50.720> well<00:05:51.050> you<00:05:51.110> know

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:51.200 
we can actually make it go well you know

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.570 
we can actually make it go well you know
show<00:05:51.530> in<00:05:51.620> terms<00:05:51.800> of<00:05:51.860> groups<00:05:52.040> another

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580 
show in terms of groups another

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.100 
show in terms of groups another
interesting<00:05:52.700> thing<00:05:52.940> is<00:05:53.210> once<00:05:53.419> you<00:05:53.540> put<00:05:53.900> in<00:05:54.050> a

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:54.110 
interesting thing is once you put in a

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:55.420 
interesting thing is once you put in a
remote<00:05:54.350> storage<00:05:54.590> model<00:05:55.010> you<00:05:55.160> can<00:05:55.250> actually

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:55.430 
remote storage model you can actually

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:58.180 
remote storage model you can actually
cycle<00:05:56.030> amongst<00:05:56.570> various<00:05:56.900> groups<00:05:57.860> of<00:05:58.010> things

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:58.190 
cycle amongst various groups of things

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.270 
cycle amongst various groups of things
here<00:05:58.400> that<00:05:58.550> are<00:05:58.760> in<00:05:58.880> the<00:05:59.060> same<00:05:59.770> room<00:06:00.770> I<00:06:01.040> won't

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 
here that are in the same room I won't

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.440 
here that are in the same room I won't
want<00:06:01.400> to<00:06:01.460> do<00:06:01.640> that<00:06:01.790> because<00:06:01.940> it'll<00:06:02.270> mess<00:06:02.419> up

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:02.450 
want to do that because it'll mess up

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:05.409 
want to do that because it'll mess up
the<00:06:02.690> filters<00:06:03.050> right<00:06:03.919> whoops<00:06:04.130> but<00:06:04.760> um<00:06:04.970> it

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:05.419 
the filters right whoops but um it

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:08.140 
the filters right whoops but um it
definitely<00:06:05.810> works<00:06:05.990> so<00:06:06.650> I'm<00:06:07.610> just<00:06:07.820> going<00:06:07.940> to<00:06:08.000> go

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.150 
definitely works so I'm just going to go

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.000 
definitely works so I'm just going to go
and<00:06:08.300> keep<00:06:08.450> breaking<00:06:08.900> things<00:06:09.080> and<00:06:09.350> letting<00:06:09.740> the

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.010 
and keep breaking things and letting the

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:11.890 
and keep breaking things and letting the
hopper<00:06:10.520> hawk<00:06:10.700> and<00:06:10.910> the<00:06:10.970> system<00:06:11.270> work<00:06:11.690> it<00:06:11.810> out

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:11.900 
hopper hawk and the system work it out

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.390 
hopper hawk and the system work it out
because<00:06:12.140> it's<00:06:12.350> actually<00:06:12.680> really<00:06:12.950> fun<00:06:13.220> to<00:06:13.310> do

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400 
because it's actually really fun to do

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.490 
because it's actually really fun to do
it<00:06:13.520> this<00:06:13.610> way<00:06:13.790> and<00:06:14.030> then<00:06:14.750> we'll<00:06:14.930> have<00:06:15.080> pretty

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:15.500 
it this way and then we'll have pretty

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.620 
it this way and then we'll have pretty
much<00:06:15.560> moved<00:06:16.220> the<00:06:16.490> majority<00:06:17.180> of<00:06:17.210> our<00:06:17.390> stuff

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:17.630 
much moved the majority of our stuff

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:18.909 
much moved the majority of our stuff
will<00:06:17.780> stop<00:06:17.960> some<00:06:18.110> machines<00:06:18.410> and<00:06:18.620> stuff<00:06:18.770> up

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:18.919 
will stop some machines and stuff up

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:21.219 
will stop some machines and stuff up
here<00:06:19.120> but<00:06:20.120> we<00:06:20.210> don't<00:06:20.360> need<00:06:20.630> them<00:06:20.840> strictly

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:21.229 
here but we don't need them strictly

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:22.690 
here but we don't need them strictly
speaking<00:06:21.500> and<00:06:21.860> I've<00:06:21.950> also<00:06:22.070> emptied<00:06:22.430> this<00:06:22.520> out

speaking and I've also emptied this out

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:24.340 
speaking and I've also emptied this out

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:05.689

wow that's not good we are cooking a
bunch<00:07:05.849> of<00:07:05.909> our<00:07:06.029> would<00:07:08.150> look<00:07:09.150> at<00:07:09.240> how<00:07:09.300> fast<00:07:09.479> it

00:07:09.619 --> 00:07:09.629 
bunch of our would look at how fast it

00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:12.320 
bunch of our would look at how fast it
has<00:07:09.719> to<00:07:09.840> go<00:07:09.960> through<00:07:09.990> these<00:07:10.259> things<00:07:11.180> this<00:07:12.180> is

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:12.330 
has to go through these things this is

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:14.989 
has to go through these things this is
amazing<00:07:13.039> it's<00:07:14.039> just<00:07:14.279> sorting<00:07:14.520> them<00:07:14.610> out<00:07:14.669> it'll

00:07:14.989 --> 00:07:14.999 
amazing it's just sorting them out it'll

00:07:14.999 --> 00:07:16.369 
amazing it's just sorting them out it'll
take<00:07:15.029> a<00:07:15.150> little<00:07:15.270> bit<00:07:15.360> of<00:07:15.449> time<00:07:15.629> but<00:07:15.810> eventually

00:07:16.369 --> 00:07:16.379 
take a little bit of time but eventually

00:07:16.379 --> 00:07:18.469 
take a little bit of time but eventually
this<00:07:16.889> system<00:07:17.159> will<00:07:17.310> just<00:07:17.699> suck<00:07:18.150> up<00:07:18.270> everything

00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:18.479 
this system will just suck up everything

00:07:18.479 --> 00:07:25.730 
this system will just suck up everything
we<00:07:19.189> should<00:07:20.189> probably<00:07:20.610> break<00:07:21.509> this<00:07:24.680> just<00:07:25.680> to

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:25.740 
we should probably break this just to

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.559 
we should probably break this just to
make<00:07:25.889> sure<00:07:25.919> everything<00:07:26.219> works<00:07:26.400> okay<00:07:27.389> well<00:07:27.539> I

00:07:27.559 --> 00:07:27.569
