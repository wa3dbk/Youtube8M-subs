make a some kind of mistake and it seems

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.060 
make a some kind of mistake and it seems

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
next door but then a mistake

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.400 
next door but then a mistake
while<00:04:15.390> there<00:04:15.510> seems<00:04:15.780> to<00:04:15.840> think<00:04:16.140> that<00:04:16.230> she

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
while there seems to think that she

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.410 
while there seems to think that she
makes<00:04:16.620> is<00:04:16.860> that<00:04:17.040> she's<00:04:17.459> on<00:04:17.610> her<00:04:17.790> meds<00:04:17.820> and<00:04:18.360> I

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:18.420 
makes is that she's on her meds and I

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.180 
makes is that she's on her meds and I
thought<00:04:18.570> the<00:04:18.720> subtlety<00:04:19.140> of<00:04:19.170> that<00:04:19.470> was<00:04:19.920> very

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
thought the subtlety of that was very

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:21.680 
thought the subtlety of that was very
good<00:04:20.430> I<00:04:20.459> like<00:04:20.549> the<00:04:20.790> way<00:04:20.820> that<00:04:21.000> was<00:04:21.150> introduced

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
good I like the way that was introduced

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.560 
good I like the way that was introduced
they<00:04:21.959> didn't<00:04:22.200> pound<00:04:22.410> it<00:04:22.680> too<00:04:22.860> hard<00:04:23.510> you<00:04:24.510> know

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
they didn't pound it too hard you know

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.360 
they didn't pound it too hard you know
