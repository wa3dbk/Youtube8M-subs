00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:59.009 
treating I was gonna say no to this
replay<00:03:57.849> but<00:03:58.060> I<00:03:58.090> looked<00:03:58.359> at<00:03:58.479> all<00:03:58.659> the<00:03:58.720> other

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
replay but I looked at all the other

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:01.439 
replay but I looked at all the other
replays<00:03:59.530> that<00:03:59.799> were<00:03:59.919> in<00:04:00.010> the<00:04:00.099> top<00:04:00.280> three<00:04:00.639> same

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:01.449 
replays that were in the top three same

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:03.089 
replays that were in the top three same
thing<00:04:01.750> they<00:04:02.290> went<00:04:02.440> backwards<00:04:02.829> we<00:04:02.919> have<00:04:03.010> to

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:03.099 
thing they went backwards we have to

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:04.680 
thing they went backwards we have to
start<00:04:03.370> I<00:04:03.639> didn't<00:04:04.030> really<00:04:04.209> watch<00:04:04.329> it<00:04:04.510> fully

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
start I didn't really watch it fully

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.349 
start I didn't really watch it fully
just<00:04:04.780> because<00:04:05.079> he<00:04:05.229> is<00:04:05.349> the<00:04:05.470> points<00:04:05.769> leader<00:04:05.829> so

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
just because he is the points leader so

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:08.640 
just because he is the points leader so
I'm<00:04:07.359> gonna<00:04:07.540> leave<00:04:07.720> it<00:04:07.870> stand<00:04:08.109> as<00:04:08.290> the<00:04:08.409> way<00:04:08.530> it

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
I'm gonna leave it stand as the way it

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:09.899 
I'm gonna leave it stand as the way it
is<00:04:08.769> and<00:04:08.979> then<00:04:09.069> pretty<00:04:09.340> much<00:04:09.489> anything<00:04:09.729> goes

00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:09.909 
is and then pretty much anything goes

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:12.420 
is and then pretty much anything goes

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
either points could be as I said the

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.830 
either points could be as I said the
track<00:04:41.130> driving<00:04:41.430> could<00:04:41.820> be<00:04:42.030> maybe<00:04:42.210> an<00:04:42.420> arcade

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
track driving could be maybe an arcade

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.140

race<00:04:43.140> I<00:04:43.500> don't<00:04:44.130> know<00:04:44.430> I'm<00:04:44.670> just<00:04:44.730> kind<00:04:45.060> of

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
race I don't know I'm just kind of

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.920 
race I don't know I'm just kind of
throwing<00:04:45.330> it<00:04:45.480> out<00:04:45.540> there

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:45.930

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
thoughts and maybe inputs on this next

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:51.590 
thoughts and maybe inputs on this next
challenge<00:04:50.190> because<00:04:50.640> it<00:04:50.760> is<00:04:50.880> a<00:04:50.910> subscriber

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
challenge because it is a subscriber

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.980 
challenge because it is a subscriber
challenge<00:04:52.020> I'd<00:04:52.830> like<00:04:53.040> to<00:04:53.190> see<00:04:53.400> maybe<00:04:53.580> your

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
challenge I'd like to see maybe your

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.330 
challenge I'd like to see maybe your
subscriber<00:04:54.990> thoughts<00:04:55.470> you<00:04:55.860> know<00:04:55.890> I'm<00:04:56.100> saying

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
subscriber thoughts you know I'm saying

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.060 
subscriber thoughts you know I'm saying
so<00:04:57.020> he's<00:04:58.020> coming<00:04:58.290> up<00:04:58.380> to<00:04:58.470> the<00:04:58.530> last<00:04:58.650> section

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
so he's coming up to the last section

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.560 
so he's coming up to the last section
right<00:04:59.340> here<00:04:59.370> he's<00:04:59.700> been<00:04:59.850> holding<00:05:00.180> some<00:05:00.330> really

right here he's been holding some really

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:01.970 
right here he's been holding some really
good<00:05:00.690> lines<00:05:00.930> he's<00:05:01.200> been<00:05:01.500> cutting<00:05:01.770> it<00:05:01.830> really

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.330 
good lines he's been cutting it really
close<00:05:02.100> and<00:05:02.790> that<00:05:03.540> thing<00:05:03.720> gets<00:05:04.010> really<00:05:05.010> slow

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
close and that thing gets really slow

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.040 
close and that thing gets really slow
sideways<00:05:05.910> and<00:05:06.090> that's<00:05:06.240> really<00:05:06.540> what<00:05:06.780> you<00:05:06.900> guys

sideways and that's really what you guys

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.600 
sideways and that's really what you guys
want<00:05:07.350> to<00:05:07.380> see<00:05:07.560> four<00:05:07.800> points<00:05:08.070> drifting<00:05:08.400> is<00:05:08.490> you

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610

want to be nice and slow but get the

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.020 
want to be nice and slow but get the
angles<00:05:10.680> get<00:05:10.860> the<00:05:10.980> momentum<00:05:11.520> going<00:05:11.700> through

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
angles get the momentum going through
