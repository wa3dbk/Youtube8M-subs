00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:12.789 
really sure then the two carbon fiber

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:17.550 
really sure then the two carbon fiber
scales<00:01:14.159> which<00:01:15.159> have<00:01:15.729> texture<00:01:16.390> to<00:01:16.600> it<00:01:16.630> they're

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
scales which have texture to it they're

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.910 
scales which have texture to it they're
not<00:01:17.680> smooth<00:01:18.719> see<00:01:19.719> if<00:01:19.780> you<00:01:19.930> get<00:01:20.530> a<00:01:20.560> look<00:01:20.710> at<00:01:20.859> that

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
not smooth see if you get a look at that

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.050 
not smooth see if you get a look at that
I<00:01:21.689> know<00:01:22.689> a<00:01:22.719> lot<00:01:22.899> of<00:01:22.930> people<00:01:23.340> say<00:01:24.340> why<00:01:24.520> would<00:01:25.030> you

see<00:01:25.570> that<00:01:25.750> I<00:01:26.850> think<00:01:27.850> just<00:01:28.659> to<00:01:28.840> me<00:01:28.990> just<00:01:29.289> because

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
see that I think just to me just because

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:31.980 
see that I think just to me just because
it's<00:01:29.859> super<00:01:30.130> solid<00:01:30.909> it<00:01:31.240> has<00:01:31.359> a<00:01:31.390> super<00:01:31.780> solid

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
it's super solid it has a super solid

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.899 
it's super solid it has a super solid
feel<00:01:32.409> to<00:01:32.439> it

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
feel to it

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.999 
feel to it
actually<00:01:33.909> when<00:01:34.030> I<00:01:34.060> took<00:01:34.149> it<00:01:34.479> apart<00:01:34.780> I<00:01:35.140> open<00:01:35.920> the

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
actually when I took it apart I open the

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:37.770 
actually when I took it apart I open the
blade<00:01:36.189> up<00:01:36.460> like<00:01:36.759> the<00:01:36.880> boccie<00:01:37.060> I<00:01:37.210> took<00:01:37.450> all<00:01:37.600> the

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
blade up like the boccie I took all the

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.800 
blade up like the boccie I took all the
screws<00:01:38.049> out<00:01:38.259> of<00:01:38.320> this<00:01:38.560> and<00:01:39.340> I<00:01:40.240> open<00:01:40.570> the<00:01:40.659> blade

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
screws out of this and I open the blade

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.870 
screws out of this and I open the blade
up<00:01:41.049> and<00:01:41.200> I<00:01:41.320> tried<00:01:41.590> to<00:01:41.710> have<00:01:41.890> you<00:01:42.369> know<00:01:42.490> do<00:01:42.759> the

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
up and I tried to have you know do the

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.300 
up and I tried to have you know do the
blade<00:01:43.060> play<00:01:43.359> test<00:01:43.659> in<00:01:43.810> there<00:01:43.929> without<00:01:44.770> any<00:01:45.159> of

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
blade play test in there without any of

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:46.770 
blade play test in there without any of
the<00:01:45.399> screws<00:01:45.729> in<00:01:45.909> it<00:01:45.999> there<00:01:46.179> was<00:01:46.329> no<00:01:46.509> blade<00:01:46.749> play

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:46.780 
the screws in it there was no blade play

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.690 
the screws in it there was no blade play
up<00:01:47.259> down<00:01:48.039> on<00:01:48.159> our<00:01:48.280> side<00:01:48.549> side<00:01:49.149> to<00:01:49.270> side<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.950> the

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
up down on our side side to side and the

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.609 
up down on our side side to side and the
thing<00:01:51.939> when<00:01:52.060> you<00:01:52.149> put<00:01:52.179> it<00:01:52.450> back<00:01:52.600> together<00:01:52.780> this

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
thing when you put it back together this

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.200 
thing when you put it back together this
thing<00:01:53.859> the<00:01:54.130> blade<00:01:54.369> is<00:01:54.549> basically<00:01:55.090> just

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
thing the blade is basically just

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.059 
thing the blade is basically just
automatically<00:01:55.990> centered<00:01:56.469> I<00:01:56.590> guess<00:01:56.799> it's<00:01:57.009> the

00:01:57.059 --> 00:01:57.069 
automatically centered I guess it's the

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:58.620 
automatically centered I guess it's the
way<00:01:57.159> they<00:01:57.369> made<00:01:57.579> it<00:01:57.759> the<00:01:57.880> tolerances<00:01:58.390> is<00:01:58.479> that

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
way they made it the tolerances is that

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.849 
way they made it the tolerances is that
they<00:01:58.749> made<00:01:58.929> it<00:01:59.079> with<00:01:59.609> but<00:02:00.609> um<00:02:01.350> it's<00:02:02.350> a<00:02:02.499> super

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:02.859 
they made it with but um it's a super

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:05.399 
they made it with but um it's a super
awesome<00:02:03.069> solid<00:02:03.759> life<00:02:04.170> one<00:02:05.170> of<00:02:05.200> the<00:02:05.319> things

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
awesome solid life one of the things

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:08.370 
awesome solid life one of the things
with<00:02:05.920> it<00:02:06.069> though<00:02:06.219> it<00:02:06.399> it<00:02:07.030> does<00:02:07.299> I<00:02:07.569> just<00:02:07.899> clean

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
with it though it it does I just clean

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.559 
with it though it it does I just clean
the<00:02:08.530> blade<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.940> does<00:02:10.240> on<00:02:10.770> rust<00:02:11.770> and

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
the blade it does on rust and

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.199 
the blade it does on rust and

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
hold the edge edge fairly well you can

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.940 
hold the edge edge fairly well you can
get<00:02:25.469> it<00:02:25.620> pretty<00:02:26.209> damn<00:02:27.209> sharp<00:02:28.459> but<00:02:29.459> um<00:02:29.640> it's

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
solid super solid super adorable I've

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.500 
solid super solid super adorable I've
used<00:02:35.549> it<00:02:35.730> for<00:02:36.530> numerous<00:02:37.530> things<00:02:37.829> that<00:02:38.510> I

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
used it for numerous things that I

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.759 
used it for numerous things that I
probably<00:02:39.840> shouldn't<00:02:40.560> use<00:02:40.709> a<00:02:40.909> folder<00:02:41.909> for<00:02:42.120> but

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
probably shouldn't use a folder for but

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:46.729 
probably shouldn't use a folder for but
like<00:02:43.769> I<00:02:43.889> said<00:02:43.950> it's<00:02:45.409> it's<00:02:46.409> a<00:02:46.500> little<00:02:46.590> bit

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
like I said it's it's a little bit

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.440 
like I said it's it's a little bit
heavier<00:02:47.129> than<00:02:47.189> most<00:02:47.760> would<00:02:47.970> want<00:02:48.180> to<00:02:48.299> carry

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
heavier than most would want to carry

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.800 
heavier than most would want to carry
but<00:02:48.840> then<00:02:49.019> again<00:02:49.139> it's<00:02:49.500> like<00:02:50.239> you<00:02:51.239> know<00:02:51.359> if<00:02:51.659> you

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
but then again it's like you know if you

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.710 
but then again it's like you know if you

with<00:04:36.640> that<00:04:36.790> and<00:04:37.030> it<00:04:37.540> might<00:04:37.660> have<00:04:37.840> been<00:04:37.870> my

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:38.140 
with that and it might have been my

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.960 
with that and it might have been my
misuse<00:04:38.590> I'm<00:04:38.830> not<00:04:38.980> sure<00:04:39.190> I<00:04:39.460> can't<00:04:39.700> really<00:04:39.790> blame

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
misuse I'm not sure I can't really blame

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.230 
misuse I'm not sure I can't really blame
then<00:04:40.330> plus<00:04:40.600> you<00:04:40.750> know<00:04:40.870> you<00:04:40.930> have<00:04:42.120> every<00:04:43.120> now

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
then plus you know you have every now

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.820 
then plus you know you have every now
and<00:04:43.420> then<00:04:43.480> you<00:04:43.630> have<00:04:43.750> a<00:04:43.780> bad<00:04:44.020> lemon<00:04:44.440> in<00:04:44.530> a<00:04:44.560> lot

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830
