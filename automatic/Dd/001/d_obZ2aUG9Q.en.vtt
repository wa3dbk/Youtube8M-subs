00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.080
 ok within a second of armor 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:14.420
 people and complete quante parapet 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.420
 kick as right 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.230
 So everyone went to the next tutorial 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.550
 This time, the Fiete pointed 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.260
 tutorials and always nice 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.060
 things to imagine this data span 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.590
 swift thing a few funny things and 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.790
 This time I think one of the 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.700
 more funny things because we build 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.680
 now just a real death cell 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.660
 where you even with quantum armor 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.040
 Immediately he dies 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.260
 the whole megaproject I say now 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.000
 the armor can withstand a lot 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.050
 are as long as the power does not go out 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.820
 it is not invincible 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.890
 no, not really i build one 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.149
 small killing method a little one small 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.210
 killing machines for development 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.440
 mechanism and will do the whole thing in the store 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.420
 Packaging that is, the Just 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.039
 so we can rebuild 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.120
 For this place I'll show you how it works 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.760
 whole thing is possible 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.229
 we really only need it first 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.189
 One or one thing the mac manufacturer 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.830
 have to grab 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.479
 this is a high energy pellet as 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.250
 also from this portal motto the portal 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.140
 Gun is with us , we place one 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.930
 block put the urge pointing forward 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.580
 and hang up there a switch on it 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.799
 hin that it fails again to build 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.350
 we are in the ground following 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.630
 make first two blocks put away there 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.439
 Dispenser out two pieces in the 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.600
 direction, it does not matter 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.490
 actually which one and there we do then 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.659
 potion softing purely three pieces each 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.280
 do not have to be sufficient 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.270
 The normal splashing is enough 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.880
 Recordings do not have to be complicated 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.740
 or so then can the level 2 yes 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.930
 actually theoretically to do it 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.920
 short a small wall cloth and indeed 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:49.229
 so packed that whole and shoot you 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.810
 to the ceiling my portal from the portal 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:55.470
 gun that when you get there what needs 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:59.610
 out if you go back very far 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.229
 city ​​so ok is placed up here that 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.700
 portal must be there that a person the 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.850
 theoretically would receive tander 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.990
 So I'll do it for a moment 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.060
 you will also have a look at it 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.170
 can be missing a little bit now 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.240
 two more plates on it 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.620
 have to put 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.590
 as soon as someone steps on it when the 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.570
 Passions thrown and then we would have 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.860
 even that can be there again 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.240
 block there can also go one 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.200
 let's make history with glass 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.070
 to such a small can the 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.190
 switch times 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:29.780
 then the pellet industry goes off you can 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:35.900
 also maybe that noise has to go with it 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:38.750
 Their sound sounds brutal 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.640
 at such a bit and with it 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.380
 killing machine also already finished everyone 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.820
 the star a field and also of quantel 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:48.380
 I have the tomb to me done 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:50.210
 go right now game mode 0 would then 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:54.770
 actually already die and after that 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:56.870
 comes portal so everyone calls the latter 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:58.460
 often xtm would be a normal one right away 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.810
 is left see quite well the 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:01.940
 pellet industry shoots the ball down and 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.900
 her and the pellets so take care of that 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.340
 that the bullet which hit the player 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:10.010
 now on half a heart r 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.470
 knocking no matter how much armor the continuing 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.670
 or similar and the special on the 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.610
 sofa ming then do accordingly 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.410
 the rest is also finished my 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.880
 small constructed death cell we 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:22.550
 Try us right now and 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.830
 otherwise you can do a tutorial 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:27.020
 just copy your friends too 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.640
 troll or other the sum or 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.720
 I have things to build properly from one 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.010
 quite certain reason or 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.880
 I've already built but anyway 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.580
 then known how can I do the same 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.290
 join 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.730
 yes, that's quite a lot of stuff 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:45.230
 actually I need the whole time out 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:46.400
 says and I'll go and see it for a moment 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.320
 There is nothing more to tell 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.640
 I 'm looking to see you 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.170
 then maybe in the next tutorial 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.850
 again check the playlist fiete dismissed 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.650
 tutorials to create an extra playlist 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.030
 maybe a little bit again maybe 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:57.320
 now soon again 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.060
 Look more left over because of it 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.470
 rebuild, there are practical thing yet 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.050
 then come, I will have already 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.940
 as planned and then then first 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:08.320
 shoot now comes the first thing 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.320
 how it works ok 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:15.560
 within a second and 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:18.790
 conversion of people and complete quantum 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:22.180
 Armor kick as right 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.180
 then shot
