00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:12.030
 but where to start the monologue first 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:16.859
 probably start with max cis 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:20.220
 but mentality when a team starts 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.199
 train simply thinks a 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.380
 why is it actually better for me 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:31.080
 play counter strike or something 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:33.480
 work out have fun i'm 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.340
 I say that including in principle about 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.510
 yourself probably all easier 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:42.960
 teams and cis what it is for a long time work 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.239
 that is, people are team opponents they 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.399
 work really don't play by 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.350
 10-12 hours a day at dota 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.989
 they analyze and not productively 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:56.579
 do these things properly 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:59.309
 saying but for some reason why we 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:05.240
 Still , we have not come to this yet 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:08.010
 we start to come to workout we 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:09.090
 have fun playing different fun 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.810
 toys 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.860
 can there we go and maybe even someone 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:20.729
 and drinking here I do not know at all in principle 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:23.430
 thumps and but by no means 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.560
 we train for 10 hours a day like this 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.560
 supposed to do 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:36.740
 representing the cis countries we come on 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:36.740
 tournaments and you have the floor guys and we suck and 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:44.159
 the words back to you andrew here again 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.119
 no way i want anyone 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.729
 to insult 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.810
 this statement but just a little bit 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:54.420
 talk about mentality and 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:57.299
 maybe think so let's say 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.869
 push to think about the future all 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.750
 still 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.820
 it seems like they are not going to ban yet 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.229
 dota in the cis and people will play with it and 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.479
 professional teams will 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.520
 will exist but will they play if 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.280
 they will play 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.160
 actually strictly speaking i would 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.569
 and did not generalize 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:20.600
 all of us here are represented not only 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.600
 natus vincere
