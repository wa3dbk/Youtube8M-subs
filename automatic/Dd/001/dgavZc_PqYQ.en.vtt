 people joined this first career to 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.380

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.520

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.180
 my first career even I 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.040
 go back neither ac and up and the next 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.230

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.129

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:55.170
 sure and I will complete but my 898 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:57.199
 of course, giving a total of 16 bonfim 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.270
 that their union 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:02.699
 Now I'm going to do one more time, what is it? 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.869
 not like those two will get me to 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:12.659
 Mango I'm not even Aquino 3rd part of 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:14.490
 un upward apart from the lateral and un 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.150
 top and so I'm following 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:21.570
 until four is completed again if one does 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.340
 in others which are of themselves from below or 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.729
 not up here 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.270
 I make 11 more that lateral one that in 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.240
 top 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.930
 I'm going to do so including children with 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:37.020
 she closed easy but the risk is how this 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.970
 side I come and box here and I go 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:46.020
 completing until I complete my 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:51.360
 four from a further 4 giving a total of 12 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:54.210
 It's just that it's not going to be here. 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.850
 because our mother is bigger when 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.009
 finish that first good afternoon support 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.670
 We 're doing the top part . 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:06.149
 so I closed here just two 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.280
 ok this part since you ready if you 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.280
 Measure in the sky what you think here goes 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:14.850
 to be very very fallen 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.050
 sewing up until now more or less 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.450
 in the middle 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.700
 if you're skinny then cuba 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.060
 made the smallest limb difficult 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:26.250
 so you set it up a little bit 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.770
 until a very nice trim of your 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.860
 shirt on your body or for someone who 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.989
 you're doing 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:37.290
 I made the front part of the back 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:40.650
 It's the same thing it 's the same then 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:45.209
 You did that right part did that part. 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:47.940
 the front was back I is 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.400
 many more difficult girls you unite 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:54.690
 then this bottom 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.980
 with another party ready and join the 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.100
 sides 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:03.510
 I usually do not like it and I eat 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:06.900
 upholsterer needle a piece of wire I 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:10.440
 I'm sewing this whole little side 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:13.530
 than the one that also sews 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.810
 all this side and here also sewing 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:20.579
 all this side here this part of 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:22.769
 up here too because sometimes 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:25.410
 I wind up losing myself I'm starting 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:28.530
 also in the crochet - I do not know what the 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.870
 little I know I try to help some 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.489
 mothers who do not know much about her either 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.790
 get doubts 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.310
 so I go like this I always try to stay 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.720
 more in my work 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.030
 angel recorded but it's very complicated 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.980
 you can also unite 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.769
 the same way you started 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.829
 museum square in the beginning you may not of 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:52.500
 Similarly only there are people who think 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:55.350
 Which is more complicated then I'm a 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.690
 simple I go there with the person's needle and 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:00.750
 I will sew around here or sending a 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.430
 seamstress 12 years, right? 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.829
 I could not finish my 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.950
 But it's not because you do not want to show it to me. 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:14.470
 You're not that, because you have a 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:17.019
 order in the front so it got a bit 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:21.670
 for me it's making the video any more 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:22.690
 questions you have please send 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:25.780
 one and mail to me 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:29.620

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:32.950
 It's also remembering after you did 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.570

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.930
 do the finishing 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:41.260
 here all this way from above 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.310
 sorry down here all round you 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.730

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:55.630
 It was also from one point got 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:57.460
 here is a point 63 lanes there 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:00.310
 you close making point that when the 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:03.730
 even the base point you closed does 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.950
 three lows three little chains 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:08.620
 close three more points low and so 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:11.710
 What are you doing all around your 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:15.780
