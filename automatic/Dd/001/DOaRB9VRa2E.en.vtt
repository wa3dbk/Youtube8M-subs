00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.580
 hello everyone for this fourth issue 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.410
 from the mag of the nights today we start 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.700
 in the difficult green for the festival of 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.869
 sleepless nights of not hearing the 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.340
 Message trio in their text 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:24.349
 respect for the planet 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.360
 we propose you a number green 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:27.290
 green green actually it's a little bit 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.730
 your day today 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.910
 by the way look like it's cute 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:35.900
 around me everything is green and understood 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:38.180
 my buddy a typical a little bit you are 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:44.030
 an effort we play it all green on 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:45.680
 the same thing but breaks the truce 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.840
 blah blah for the rest I ship you 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:55.309
 argens in the rehearsal room are 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:57.609
 ready then asio not yet total 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:57.609
 on point 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:07.520
 and live from the repetition of 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:07.520
 musicians of the big olive heart of 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:17.220
 keyboard my name is and xavier tribolet 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.380
 I take care of the group that will accompany 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.530
 choristers of the great chorale 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.440
 so my role is to 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.030
 prepare the scores to make 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.440
 arrangements around the pieces and 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.630
 around the heart arrangements especially 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.740
 the difference we accompany 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.080
 choristers is that they are more 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.130
 many so obviously we want to 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.630
 play with everyone 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.159
 in the same way as playing with a 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.470
 only singer is hard to imagine 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.420
 together she knows from him to be 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.640
 meet with choir director and with 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.399
 all the singers to keep the tempo 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:49.040
 not getting carried away not long prepares 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:50.509
 obviously the arrangements and 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.369
 today is the first time 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.800
 repeats with the choir leaders who 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.800
 discover the arrangements the way 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.200
 of which we are appropriating pieces you 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.570
 have seen that already sends heavy good ok 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:06.490
 I was lying talent and I assure you with 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.490
 the 850 addresses at the shelter 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.850
 during the week there at dawn and the water 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.790
 provided bicycles for 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:21.030
 nice singers and at worst if you like 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.860
 nil bike or walking still remains 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.300
 the horses and saw what like concert 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.310
 early this week and carpooling 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.510
 it's important it looks pretty good 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.400
 that you eat straw 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.110
 I hope it comes from here 1 because 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.600
 we at the festival use products 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.710
 Local pat oaten no badge and also 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.360
 this week for the singers 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.060
 we set up vegetarian meals 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.340
 that's good for you the one 30 finish in 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.470
 lasagna to one is a little what does 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.000
 the same you and I see you at the festival 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.070
 y you argue about plastic cups 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.950
 we use eco cups it's a 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.950
 waste reduction finally late 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.459
 mark it's always rates that pedal 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.459
 go roll 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.710
 so in fact my role is already to have 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.240
 a word or a little bit the few 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:09.470
 titles in fact of the great chorale and I 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.470
 am therefore an accompanist pianist 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.810
 in front of my TV because I'm watching 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.160
 patrick sébastien every Saturday no 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.960
 but no kidding it would of course 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.970
 in front of the great chorale be at the service 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.740
 also choir leaders if they have 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.000
 need me during the show too 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.040
 but in any case I will try to 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.830
 make the most of this magnificent 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.220
 heart in front of me I'll be fine there in 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:29.890
 the room 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.600
 but after that I will resume classes 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.100
 but choir direction finally here 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.240
 our city ​​musicians everyday 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:39.170
 my happiness is necessarily 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.760
 hear the weapons we wrote 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.960
 inevitably it is something we 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.240
 alone in front of other small pages 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.700

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:53.300
 emotion he had not hesitated 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:56.170
 he was not conscious 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:59.280
 how much he missed 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:02.410
 the lands of his childhood 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:05.430

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.430
 paper casseroles 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:12.440
