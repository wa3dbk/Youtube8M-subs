chips popping me loose

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:54.880 
chips popping me loose
but<00:00:52.399> one<00:00:52.910> thing<00:00:53.120> we<00:00:53.269> do<00:00:53.480> do<00:00:53.719> on<00:00:54.469> this<00:00:54.649> situation

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
but one thing we do do on this situation

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.040 
but one thing we do do on this situation
we<00:00:55.489> use<00:00:55.519> just<00:00:55.910> a<00:00:56.059> little<00:00:56.089> more<00:00:56.480> of<00:00:56.629> the<00:00:56.719> cream

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
we use just a little more of the cream

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.189 
we use just a little more of the cream
because<00:00:58.039> his<00:00:58.460> his<00:00:59.239> little<00:00:59.539> sponges<00:00:59.899> are<00:01:00.050> gonna

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
because his his little sponges are gonna

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.189 
because his his little sponges are gonna
soak<00:01:00.440> up<00:01:00.620> everything<00:01:01.070> everything<00:01:02.199> so

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
soak up everything everything so

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:04.899 
soak up everything everything so
sometimes<00:01:03.769> it's<00:01:04.010> hard<00:01:04.040> to<00:01:04.309> deal<00:01:04.430> with<00:01:04.460> dry

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:04.909 
sometimes it's hard to deal with dry

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.179 
sometimes it's hard to deal with dry
sometimes<00:01:05.810> it<00:01:05.960> will<00:01:06.020> take<00:01:06.079> that<00:01:06.470> product<00:01:07.100> that

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
sometimes it will take that product that

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:08.710 
sometimes it will take that product that
you<00:01:07.310> put<00:01:07.520> in<00:01:07.700> there<00:01:07.880> and<00:01:08.360> you<00:01:08.450> thought<00:01:08.659> that

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
you put in there and you thought that

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.929 
you put in there and you thought that
you<00:01:08.869> put<00:01:09.170> ample<00:01:09.530> amount<00:01:09.860> and<00:01:10.070> you<00:01:10.220> did<00:01:10.400> not

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:10.939 
you put ample amount and you did not

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:15.249 
you put ample amount and you did not
so<00:01:11.299> that<00:01:11.900> maintenance<00:01:12.229> will<00:01:12.560> not<00:01:12.799> hold<00:01:13.100> or<00:01:14.259> you

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
so that maintenance will not hold or you

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:16.840 
so that maintenance will not hold or you
know<00:01:15.409> he<00:01:15.590> were<00:01:15.680> going<00:01:15.920> to<00:01:15.979> the<00:01:16.100> dryer<00:01:16.340> cut<00:01:16.700> them

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
know he were going to the dryer cut them

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.700 
know he were going to the dryer cut them
under<00:01:17.000> there<00:01:17.210> and<00:01:17.689> we'll<00:01:17.869> store<00:01:18.020> like<00:01:18.170> nothing

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
under there and we'll store like nothing

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.420 
under there and we'll store like nothing
happened<00:01:19.159> so<00:01:19.610> you<00:01:20.030> make<00:01:20.360> sure<00:01:20.689> that<00:01:21.280> you<00:01:22.280> put

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
happened so you make sure that you put

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.569 
happened so you make sure that you put
enough<00:01:22.670> tension<00:01:22.970> to<00:01:23.329> the<00:01:23.899> hair<00:01:24.110> one<00:01:24.590> you<00:01:25.399> make

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:25.579 
enough tension to the hair one you make

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:27.130 
enough tension to the hair one you make
sure<00:01:25.729> that<00:01:25.850> you<00:01:26.000> use<00:01:26.180> enough<00:01:26.570> product<00:01:27.079> to

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
sure that you use enough product to

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.780 
sure that you use enough product to
where<00:01:27.380> you're<00:01:27.500> not<00:01:27.680> saturating<00:01:28.340> a<00:01:28.399> lot<00:01:28.549> for

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
where you're not saturating a lot for

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.910 
where you're not saturating a lot for
buildup<00:01:29.329> but<00:01:29.990> you're<00:01:30.229> getting<00:01:30.500> just<00:01:30.710> enough

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
buildup but you're getting just enough

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.100 
buildup but you're getting just enough
to<00:01:31.460> where<00:01:31.670> the<00:01:32.570> hair<00:01:32.899> the<00:01:33.469> part<00:01:33.829> the<00:01:34.280> scalp<00:01:34.640> and

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
to where the hair the part the scalp and

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.800 
to where the hair the part the scalp and
the<00:01:36.110> lock<00:01:36.320> is<00:01:36.680> trained<00:01:37.369> on<00:01:37.729> that<00:01:38.060> level<00:01:38.780> that

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
the lock is trained on that level that

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.380 
the lock is trained on that level that
you<00:01:39.020> want<00:01:39.170> to<00:01:39.350> be<00:01:39.500> on<00:01:39.710> I<00:01:40.070> don't<00:01:40.549> really<00:01:40.969> put<00:01:41.210> as

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
you want to be on I don't really put as

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.149 
you want to be on I don't really put as
many<00:01:41.630> of<00:01:41.869> these<00:01:42.020> locks<00:01:42.409> under<00:01:42.740> one

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
many of these locks under one

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.370 
many of these locks under one
as<00:01:43.490> you<00:01:43.609> see<00:01:43.789> me<00:01:43.939> doing<00:01:44.119> other<00:01:44.479> ones<00:01:44.719> because

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
as you see me doing other ones because

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.870 
as you see me doing other ones because
they're<00:01:45.649> bigger<00:01:45.859> and<00:01:45.979> the<00:01:46.219> team<00:01:46.460> will<00:01:46.700> not

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
they're bigger and the team will not

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.940 
they're bigger and the team will not
hold<00:01:47.179> them<00:01:47.359> which<00:01:47.960> I'm<00:01:48.140> sure<00:01:48.350> that<00:01:48.530> you<00:01:48.829> know

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
hold them which I'm sure that you know

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.349 
hold them which I'm sure that you know
your<00:01:49.159> trial<00:01:49.429> and<00:01:49.549> error<00:01:49.700> you<00:01:49.880> will<00:01:49.909> see<00:01:50.149> for

00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:50.359 
your trial and error you will see for

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:55.179 
your trial and error you will see for
yourself<00:01:51.789> but<00:01:52.789> we<00:01:53.630> have<00:01:53.869> to<00:01:54.140> associate<00:01:54.740> a

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
yourself but we have to associate a
