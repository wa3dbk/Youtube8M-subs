other<00:03:27.000> one<00:03:27.270> so<00:03:27.540> it'll<00:03:28.020> probably<00:03:28.050> be<00:03:28.380> real<00:03:28.560> easy

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:28.710 
other one so it'll probably be real easy

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.140 
other one so it'll probably be real easy
to<00:03:28.890> find<00:03:28.980> I'll<00:03:29.370> show<00:03:29.550> you<00:03:29.610> where<00:03:29.850> I'm<00:03:29.940> at<00:03:30.120> on

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
to find I'll show you where I'm at on

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.960 
to find I'll show you where I'm at on
the<00:03:30.300> map<00:03:30.330> anyway<00:03:30.990> but<00:03:31.800> uh<00:03:31.830> it's<00:03:32.490> not<00:03:32.610> too<00:03:32.670> far

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
the map anyway but uh it's not too far

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:37.790 
the map anyway but uh it's not too far
from<00:03:33.120> another<00:03:33.390> one<00:03:36.110> all<00:03:37.110> right<00:03:37.290> the<00:03:37.500> other<00:03:37.530> one

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
from another one all right the other one

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.620 
from another one all right the other one
was<00:03:37.980> right<00:03:38.100> up<00:03:38.250> here<00:03:38.430> this<00:03:38.640> one's<00:03:38.850> right<00:03:39.060> down

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
was right up here this one's right down

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.020 
was right up here this one's right down
here<00:03:39.930> and<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.890> next<00:03:41.130> one<00:03:41.280> is<00:03:41.700> in<00:03:41.880> the<00:03:42.000> next

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
here and the next one is in the next

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.060 
here and the next one is in the next
room<00:03:42.450> DPS<00:03:43.290> is<00:03:43.470> already<00:03:43.830> heading<00:03:44.160> that<00:03:44.400> way<00:03:46.070> if

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
room DPS is already heading that way if

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.100 
room DPS is already heading that way if
you<00:03:47.280> go<00:03:47.430> straight<00:03:47.760> forward<00:03:48.030> and<00:03:48.330> I<00:03:48.660> don't

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
you go straight forward and I don't

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.020 
you go straight forward and I don't
think<00:03:49.380> that<00:03:49.530> you<00:03:49.620> can<00:03:49.830> go<00:03:50.040> these<00:03:50.280> shortcuts

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
think that you can go these shortcuts

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.020 
think that you can go these shortcuts
when<00:03:51.720> you're<00:03:51.870> doing<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.530> the<00:03:53.280> rate<00:03:53.520> itself

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
when you're doing the the rate itself

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.840 
when you're doing the the rate itself
you<00:03:54.300> have<00:03:54.480> to<00:03:55.130> complete<00:03:56.130> it<00:03:56.250> before<00:03:56.400> you<00:03:56.700> can

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
you have to complete it before you can

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.280 
you have to complete it before you can
do<00:03:57.030> some<00:03:57.270> of<00:03:57.360> these<00:03:57.450> shortcuts<00:03:57.960> that<00:03:58.110> we're

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
do some of these shortcuts that we're

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.720 
do some of these shortcuts that we're
going<00:03:58.440> through<00:03:58.740> there's<00:03:58.980> kind<00:03:59.190> of<00:03:59.220> a<00:03:59.340> long<00:03:59.550> way

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
going through there's kind of a long way

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.850 
going through there's kind of a long way
around<00:04:00.030> it<00:04:00.239> but<00:04:00.840> anyway<00:04:01.140> the<00:04:01.290> next<00:04:01.530> one<00:04:01.650> is

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
around it but anyway the next one is

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.770 
around it but anyway the next one is
down<00:04:02.100> here<00:04:02.340> on<00:04:02.430> the<00:04:02.550> ground<00:04:02.580> underneath<00:04:03.510> kind

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
down here on the ground underneath kind

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.040 
down here on the ground underneath kind
of<00:04:03.930> an<00:04:04.050> overhang<00:04:04.620> of<00:04:04.980> ice<00:04:05.280> I<00:04:05.660> actually<00:04:06.660> got

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
of an overhang of ice I actually got

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.710 
of an overhang of ice I actually got
confused<00:04:07.530> if<00:04:07.739> it<00:04:08.100> was<00:04:08.280> up<00:04:08.520> top<00:04:08.730> or<00:04:09.060> below<00:04:09.209> but

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
confused if it was up top or below but

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.729 
confused if it was up top or below but
how<00:04:10.290> so<00:04:10.500> you<00:04:10.560> guys<00:04:10.709> where<00:04:10.920> I'm<00:04:11.010> at<00:04:11.130> with<00:04:11.310> map<00:04:12.739> so

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
how so you guys where I'm at with map so

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.050 
how so you guys where I'm at with map so
where<00:04:13.860> guys<00:04:14.010> could<00:04:14.220> come<00:04:14.370> out<00:04:14.430> of<00:04:14.550> that<00:04:14.700> room

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
where guys could come out of that room

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.159 
where guys could come out of that room
and<00:04:15.239> go<00:04:15.380> straight<00:04:16.380> ahead<00:04:16.520> right<00:04:17.520> off<00:04:18.120> to<00:04:19.020> the

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
and go straight ahead right off to the

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:21.349 
and go straight ahead right off to the
side<00:04:19.410> of<00:04:19.590> this<00:04:19.739> um<00:04:20.040> I<00:04:20.370> don't<00:04:20.730> know<00:04:20.880> what<00:04:21.120> it<00:04:21.209> is

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
side of this um I don't know what it is

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.180 
side of this um I don't know what it is
kind<00:04:21.690> of<00:04:21.750> like<00:04:21.870> an<00:04:22.020> overhang<00:04:22.410> of<00:04:22.530> ice<00:04:22.680> I<00:04:22.980> guess

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
kind of like an overhang of ice I guess

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.130 
kind of like an overhang of ice I guess
but<00:04:23.790> it's<00:04:23.970> right<00:04:24.180> down<00:04:24.360> here<00:04:24.390> it's<00:04:24.930> not<00:04:25.080> too

but it's right down here it's not too
hard<00:04:25.560> to<00:04:25.650> find

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
hard to find

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:47.090 
here pretty much out and open but I

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:51.070 
here pretty much out and open but I
don't<00:05:47.720> know<00:05:48.140> if<00:05:48.440> I<00:05:48.920> didn't<00:05:49.310> get<00:05:49.520> one<00:05:49.790> on<00:05:50.180> or

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
don't know if I didn't get one on or

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:55.780 
don't know if I didn't get one on or
what<00:05:51.470> happened<00:05:51.950> but<00:05:52.010> I'm<00:05:52.430> at<00:05:53.860> I'm<00:05:54.860> at<00:05:55.130> six<00:05:55.580> of

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:55.790 
what happened but I'm at I'm at six of

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:58.060 
what happened but I'm at I'm at six of
eight<00:05:56.030> right<00:05:56.300> now<00:05:56.510> and<00:05:57.350> I<00:05:57.500> believe<00:05:57.800> the<00:05:57.950> next

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:58.070 
eight right now and I believe the next

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:59.890 
eight right now and I believe the next
one<00:05:58.310> we<00:05:58.430> found<00:05:58.580> was<00:05:58.970> the<00:05:59.120> last<00:05:59.360> one<00:05:59.570> we<00:05:59.720> found

00:05:59.890 --> 00:05:59.900 
one we found was the last one we found

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.840 
one we found was the last one we found
so<00:06:00.560> I'm<00:06:00.680> not<00:06:00.800> really<00:06:00.980> sure<00:06:01.220> if<00:06:01.400> I<00:06:01.520> didn't

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:01.850

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:03.670 
so I'm not really sure if I didn't
