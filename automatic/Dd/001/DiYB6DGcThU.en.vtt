00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:15.159 
and before we were immense you know we

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:16.229 
and before we were immense you know we
had<00:04:15.280> to<00:04:15.400> soak<00:04:15.579> up<00:04:15.700> a<00:04:15.819> lot<00:04:15.940> of<00:04:15.970> pressure

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
had to soak up a lot of pressure

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.960 
had to soak up a lot of pressure
defensively<00:04:17.229> apart<00:04:17.560> from<00:04:17.650> one<00:04:17.799> drop<00:04:18.039> pass<00:04:18.250> you

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
defensively apart from one drop pass you

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.610 
defensively apart from one drop pass you
know<00:04:19.090> we<00:04:19.209> really<00:04:19.359> did<00:04:19.600> dominate<00:04:19.989> past<00:04:20.229> attack

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
know we really did dominate past attack

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.200 
know we really did dominate past attack
and<00:04:20.829> that's<00:04:20.949> quite<00:04:21.609> something<00:04:21.850> to<00:04:21.970> say

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
and that's quite something to say

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.520 
and that's quite something to say
because<00:04:22.389> they've<00:04:22.690> been<00:04:22.780> in<00:04:22.900> great<00:04:23.050> shape<00:04:23.289> this

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
because they've been in great shape this

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
defensively over the last few weeks or

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.330 
defensively over the last few weeks or
months<00:04:31.510> we<00:04:32.320> have<00:04:32.410> not<00:04:32.560> the<00:04:32.590> same<00:04:32.800> team<00:04:33.070> every

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.770 
months we have not the same team every
week<00:04:33.370> that's<00:04:33.729> for<00:04:33.880> sure<00:04:34.000> that<00:04:34.210> makes<00:04:34.360> it<00:04:34.570> a<00:04:34.599> bit

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
week that's for sure that makes it a bit

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.230 
week that's for sure that makes it a bit
harder<00:04:35.080> and

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
harder and

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.089 
harder and
you<00:04:36.569> know<00:04:36.690> you<00:04:36.750> need<00:04:36.960> a<00:04:37.020> motion<00:04:37.259> to<00:04:37.470> defender

00:04:38.089 --> 00:04:38.099 
you know you need a motion to defender

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:39.529 
you know you need a motion to defender
the<00:04:38.190> way<00:04:38.310> we<00:04:38.430> do<00:04:38.580> fame<00:04:38.729> without<00:04:38.940> blitz<00:04:39.210> defense

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:39.539 
the way we do fame without blitz defense

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:41.659 
the way we do fame without blitz defense
and<00:04:39.870> perhaps<00:04:40.620> we<00:04:40.770> save<00:04:40.979> the<00:04:41.099> emotion<00:04:41.490> for<00:04:41.610> the

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:41.669 
and perhaps we save the emotion for the

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:43.969 
and perhaps we save the emotion for the
really<00:04:41.880> big<00:04:41.910> games<00:04:42.240> but<00:04:42.539> yeah<00:04:43.410> bouncy<00:04:43.800> should
