take<00:00:00.450> loading<00:00:00.690> tahir<00:00:01.050> and<00:00:01.230> as<00:00:01.620> you<00:00:01.709> can<00:00:01.829> see

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
take loading tahir and as you can see

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.220 
take loading tahir and as you can see
I've<00:00:02.129> got<00:00:02.250> a<00:00:02.280> lot<00:00:02.429> of<00:00:02.520> hard<00:00:02.700> drives<00:00:02.939> but<00:00:03.810> even

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
I've got a lot of hard drives but even

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.590 
I've got a lot of hard drives but even
more<00:00:04.410> sitting<00:00:04.830> here<00:00:04.950> on<00:00:05.040> the<00:00:05.130> table<00:00:05.310> and<00:00:05.940> I've

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
more sitting here on the table and I've

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.390 
more sitting here on the table and I've
upgraded<00:00:06.899> several<00:00:07.680> computers<00:00:08.099> over<00:00:08.250> the

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
upgraded several computers over the

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.070 
upgraded several computers over the
years<00:00:08.670> I've<00:00:09.030> upgraded<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.510> hard<00:00:09.690> drives<00:00:09.900> and

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
years I've upgraded the hard drives and

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.080 
years I've upgraded the hard drives and
computers<00:00:10.500> because<00:00:10.710> I<00:00:10.769> ran<00:00:10.889> out<00:00:10.950> of<00:00:11.070> space<00:00:11.219> or

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
computers because I ran out of space or

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.480 
computers because I ran out of space or
something<00:00:12.990> on<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.139> drive<00:00:13.349> flaked<00:00:13.710> and<00:00:13.950> I

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
something on the drive flaked and I

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.369 
something on the drive flaked and I
wasn't<00:00:15.089> really<00:00:15.179> sure<00:00:15.450> what<00:00:15.480> to<00:00:15.809> do<00:00:16.020> with<00:00:16.049> all

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
wasn't really sure what to do with all

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.230 
wasn't really sure what to do with all
these<00:00:16.500> drives<00:00:16.800> because<00:00:17.400> I<00:00:17.520> keep<00:00:17.820> thinking

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
these drives because I keep thinking

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.200 
these drives because I keep thinking
that<00:00:18.270> maybe<00:00:18.900> something<00:00:19.650> important<00:00:20.189> is<00:00:20.760> stored

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
that maybe something important is stored

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.730 
that maybe something important is stored
on<00:00:21.359> one<00:00:21.539> of<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.689> drive<00:00:21.900> so<00:00:22.109> I<00:00:22.140> have<00:00:22.289> kept<00:00:22.529> them

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
on one of the drive so I have kept them

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.679 
on one of the drive so I have kept them
for<00:00:23.010> years<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.400> years<00:00:23.580> I<00:00:23.699> think<00:00:23.880> some<00:00:24.660> of

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
for years and years I think some of

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.349 
for years and years I think some of
these<00:00:24.869> are<00:00:25.820> maybe<00:00:26.820> even<00:00:26.939> as<00:00:27.449> small<00:00:27.750> as<00:00:29.359> 15

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
these are maybe even as small as 15

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.930 
these are maybe even as small as 15
gigabytes<00:00:30.920> not<00:00:31.920> very<00:00:32.130> practical<00:00:32.279> by<00:00:32.640> today's

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
gigabytes not very practical by today's

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.139 
gigabytes not very practical by today's
standards<00:00:33.329> but<00:00:33.420> hey<00:00:34.550> maybe<00:00:35.550> I<00:00:35.640> can<00:00:35.790> still<00:00:35.940> food

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
standards but hey maybe I can still food

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.979 
standards but hey maybe I can still food
it<00:00:36.270> up<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:37.230> I<00:00:37.640> got<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.670> thinking<00:00:39.090> what<00:00:39.750> if<00:00:39.870> I

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
it up and I got to thinking what if I

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.770 
it up and I got to thinking what if I
want<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.260> get<00:00:40.410> all<00:00:40.890> this<00:00:41.340> data<00:00:41.640> off<00:00:42.300> of<00:00:42.660> these

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
want to get all this data off of these

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.709 
want to get all this data off of these
drives<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:44.120> assess<00:00:45.120> whether<00:00:45.329> or<00:00:45.420> not<00:00:45.570> it's

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
drives and assess whether or not it's

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.810 
drives and assess whether or not it's
worth<00:00:45.870> keeping<00:00:46.020> or<00:00:46.260> not<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:47.160> I<00:00:47.550> don't<00:00:47.579> really

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
worth keeping or not and I don't really

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.490 
worth keeping or not and I don't really
want<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.180> have<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.690> use<00:00:48.870> another<00:00:48.989> desktop

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
want to have to use another desktop

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.930 
want to have to use another desktop
computer<00:00:49.890> I'm<00:00:50.010> mostly<00:00:50.280> I'm<00:00:50.340> using<00:00:50.579> laptops

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
computer I'm mostly I'm using laptops

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.939 
computer I'm mostly I'm using laptops
these<00:00:51.149> days<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.870> so<00:00:52.379> it's<00:00:52.500> not<00:00:52.649> very

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
these days and so it's not very

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.119 
these days and so it's not very
convenient<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.640> try<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.600> put<00:00:54.780> one<00:00:54.930> of<00:00:55.020> these

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
convenient to try to put one of these

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.189 
convenient to try to put one of these
inside<00:00:56.129> something<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:56.940> is<00:00:57.210> too<00:00:57.780> small<00:00:58.050> to

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
inside something that is too small to

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.240 
inside something that is too small to
hold<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.730> and<00:00:59.730> so<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.770> went<00:01:01.770> out<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.070> got<00:01:02.190> a

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
hold it and so I went out and got a

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.050 
hold it and so I went out and got a
Voyager<00:01:02.910> s3<00:01:03.870> from<00:01:04.680> newer<00:01:04.890> tech<00:01:05.189> there's<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.790> lot

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
Voyager s3 from newer tech there's a lot

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.270 
Voyager s3 from newer tech there's a lot
of<00:01:06.150> other<00:01:06.270> brands<00:01:06.510> that<00:01:06.810> also<00:01:07.229> make<00:01:07.439> something

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
of other brands that also make something

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.070 
of other brands that also make something
similar<00:01:08.580> but<00:01:08.909> it's<00:01:09.119> basically<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.510> case<00:01:09.810> that

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
similar but it's basically a case that

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.679 
similar but it's basically a case that
holds<00:01:10.680> three<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.670> half<00:01:11.820> inch<00:01:12.060> hard<00:01:12.270> disks

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
holds three and a half inch hard disks

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.450 
holds three and a half inch hard disks
that<00:01:12.930> are<00:01:13.909> SATA<00:01:14.909> SATA<00:01:15.360> drives<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:16.460> connects

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
that are SATA SATA drives and connects

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.420 
that are SATA SATA drives and connects
by<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.670> USB<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.540> your<00:01:18.659> laptop<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:20.159> could<00:01:20.280> also

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
by a USB to your laptop you could also

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.670 
by a USB to your laptop you could also
connect<00:01:20.729> it<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:20.939> desktop<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.420> course<00:01:21.659> but<00:01:21.900> in

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
connect it to a desktop of course but in

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.649 
connect it to a desktop of course but in
my<00:01:22.860> case<00:01:22.920> I'm<00:01:23.250> looking<00:01:23.520> at<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:24.210> convenience

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
my case I'm looking at the convenience

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.990 
my case I'm looking at the convenience
of<00:01:24.750> having<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:25.080> for<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.350> laptop<00:01:25.799> do<00:01:26.729> great<00:01:26.880> thing

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
of having it for a laptop do great thing

Voyager s3 is a pretty simple design
it's<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:38.040> case<00:01:38.939> that's<00:01:39.240> got<00:01:39.540> down<00:01:40.500> in<00:01:40.619> here<00:01:40.710> it's

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
it's a case that's got down in here it's

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.730 
it's a case that's got down in here it's
got<00:01:41.009> this<00:01:41.189> SATA<00:01:41.520> power<00:01:41.970> supply<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.780> data

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
got this SATA power supply and data

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.429 
got this SATA power supply and data
connection<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.520> then<00:01:45.210> on<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.420> back<00:01:45.600> if<00:01:46.350> you

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.789 
got your SP 308 connects by a USB 300
but<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.500> will<00:01:49.560> also<00:01:49.890> work<00:01:50.070> with<00:01:50.570> two<00:01:51.570> dot<00:01:51.750> o

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799
