plagued by icebergs and ice floes and so

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.939 
plagued by icebergs and ice floes and so
on<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.629> indeed<00:01:03.899> as<00:01:04.110> I<00:01:04.229> flew<00:01:04.409> over<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.769> sea

on and indeed as I flew over the sea
coming<00:01:05.369> here<00:01:05.960> there<00:01:06.960> were<00:01:07.080> there<00:01:07.380> was<00:01:07.439> plenty

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
ice coming together which is a great

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.910 
ice coming together which is a great
opportunity<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.659> be<00:01:18.900> able<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.080> fly<00:01:19.320> over<00:01:19.740> these

opportunity to be able to fly over these

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.570 
opportunity to be able to fly over these
some<00:01:20.250> areas<00:01:20.759> of<00:01:21.119> open<00:01:21.869> sea<00:01:22.250> during<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.369> day

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
some areas of open sea during the day

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.190 
some areas of open sea during the day
when<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.060> sun<00:01:24.240> is<00:01:24.270> shining<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:25.020> get<00:01:25.170> a

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
when the sun is shining and you get a

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.240 
when the sun is shining and you get a
pretty<00:01:25.290> good<00:01:25.790> view<00:01:26.790> of<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.560> other<00:01:28.560> sea<00:01:28.950> below

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
pretty good view of the other sea below

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.249 
pretty good view of the other sea below
now<00:01:29.490> in<00:01:29.939> this<00:01:30.090> particular<00:01:30.450> view<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:30.840> can<00:01:30.990> see

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
now in this particular view you can see

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.170 
now in this particular view you can see
that<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.590> ice<00:01:31.740> is<00:01:31.950> swirling<00:01:32.369> around<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.880> the

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
that the ice is swirling around and the

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.490 
that the ice is swirling around and the
reason<00:01:33.420> why<00:01:33.479> it's<00:01:33.630> swirling<00:01:33.780> around<00:01:34.079> is

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
reason why it's swirling around is

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.980 
reason why it's swirling around is
because<00:01:34.890> it's<00:01:35.070> being<00:01:35.310> drifted<00:01:36.180> by<00:01:36.360> currents

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
because it's being drifted by currents

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.340 
because it's being drifted by currents
and<00:01:37.259> within<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.369> sea<00:01:38.610> so<00:01:38.939> seeker<00:01:39.630> answer<00:01:39.930> was

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
and within the sea so seeker answer was

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.889 
and within the sea so seeker answer was
swirling<00:01:40.619> it<00:01:40.920> round<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:42.329> produces<00:01:42.750> these

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
swirling it round and it produces these

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.899 
swirling it round and it produces these
wonderful<00:01:43.380> patterns<00:01:44.250> on<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.520> sea<00:01:44.700> surface

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
wonderful patterns on the sea surface

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.480 
wonderful patterns on the sea surface
now<00:01:45.840> because<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.649> this<00:01:46.770> week<00:01:47.009> we<00:01:47.189> call<00:01:47.369> this

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
now because of this week we call this

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.340 
now because of this week we call this
type<00:01:47.700> of<00:01:47.820> ice<00:01:47.939> drift<00:01:48.329> ice<00:01:48.600> because<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:49.020> drifts

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
type of ice drift ice because it drifts

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.130 
type of ice drift ice because it drifts
around<00:01:49.439> on<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.890> sea<00:01:50.070> currents<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.840> it<00:01:51.840> has

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
around on the sea currents and it has

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.490 
around on the sea currents and it has
different<00:01:52.740> concentrations<00:01:53.869> here<00:01:54.869> we<00:01:55.020> can<00:01:55.170> see

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
different concentrations here we can see

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.190 
different concentrations here we can see
that<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.640> ice<00:01:56.790> is<00:01:57.149> becoming<00:01:57.450> more

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
that the the ice is becoming more

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.740 
that the the ice is becoming more
concentrated<00:01:59.040> in<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.219> previous<00:01:59.670> shots<00:02:00.540> it

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
concentrated in the previous shots it

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.450 
concentrated in the previous shots it
was<00:02:00.869> perhaps<00:02:01.560> up<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.799> 25<00:02:02.280> percent

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
was perhaps up to 25 percent

land and because of that you call it

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.330 
land and because of that you call it
land<00:04:02.370> fast<00:04:02.850> ice<00:04:03.769> and<00:04:04.769> that's<00:04:05.160> really

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
land fast ice and that's really

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.280 
land fast ice and that's really
important<00:04:05.880> for<00:04:05.940> locals<00:04:06.480> because<00:04:06.870> they<00:04:07.019> can<00:04:07.140> go

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
important for locals because they can go

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.229 
important for locals because they can go
out<00:04:07.410> onto<00:04:07.590> this<00:04:07.829> ice<00:04:08.040> to<00:04:08.310> hunt<00:04:08.519> up<00:04:08.700> to<00:04:08.850> fish<00:04:09.060> and

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
out onto this ice to hunt up to fish and

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:10.850 
out onto this ice to hunt up to fish and
so<00:04:09.360> on<00:04:09.390> but<00:04:09.900> you<00:04:09.959> can<00:04:10.079> see<00:04:10.110> that<00:04:10.500> it<00:04:10.590> is<00:04:10.620> being

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
so on but you can see that it is being

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.110 
so on but you can see that it is being
broken<00:04:11.100> away<00:04:11.459> so<00:04:12.390> it's<00:04:13.140> a<00:04:13.290> fantastic<00:04:14.120> view

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
broken away so it's a fantastic view

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.210 
broken away so it's a fantastic view
from<00:04:15.510> from<00:04:15.780> up<00:04:15.870> in<00:04:15.989> the<00:04:16.079> aeroplane<00:04:16.350> of<00:04:16.709> the<00:04:17.010> sea

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.580 
from from up in the aeroplane of the sea
ice<00:04:17.419> but<00:04:18.419> of<00:04:18.540> course<00:04:18.750> we<00:04:19.109> are<00:04:19.260> worried<00:04:19.530> about

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
ice but of course we are worried about

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.460 
ice but of course we are worried about
what<00:04:20.359> global<00:04:21.359> warming<00:04:21.539> and<00:04:22.049> climate<00:04:22.200> change

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
what global warming and climate change

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:30.290 
what global warming and climate change
is<00:04:22.919> doing<00:04:23.310> to<00:04:24.000> sea<00:04:24.180> ice<00:04:24.330> and<00:04:24.599> the<00:04:24.870> effects

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:30.300 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.240 

climate<00:04:31.050> change<00:04:31.349> and<00:04:31.740> our<00:04:31.889> worries<00:04:32.159> about

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
climate change and our worries about

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:33.920 
climate change and our worries about
global<00:04:32.729> warming<00:04:32.759> and<00:04:33.210> increasing<00:04:33.810> of

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
global warming and increasing of

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.010 
global warming and increasing of
greenhouse<00:04:34.770> gases<00:04:35.159> in<00:04:35.310> the<00:04:35.340> atmosphere<00:04:36.020> we're

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.020 
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere we're

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.490 
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere we're
seeing<00:04:37.289> a<00:04:37.620> dramatic<00:04:38.220> decrease<00:04:39.000> in<00:04:39.150> the<00:04:40.139> amount

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
seeing a dramatic decrease in the amount

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:45.080 
seeing a dramatic decrease in the amount
of<00:04:40.919> ice<00:04:41.729> that's<00:04:42.449> forming<00:04:42.960> on<00:04:43.319> the<00:04:43.560> sea<00:04:44.090> and

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
of ice that's forming on the sea and

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.930 
of ice that's forming on the sea and
actually<00:04:45.569> being<00:04:45.780> retained<00:04:46.620> through<00:04:47.370> the

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
actually being retained through the

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.180 
actually being retained through the
Arctic<00:04:48.449> summer<00:04:48.690> and<00:04:49.080> so<00:04:49.590> we're<00:04:49.830> having<00:04:49.979> a

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
Arctic summer and so we're having a

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.990 
Arctic summer and so we're having a
decrease<00:04:50.729> in<00:04:51.030> the<00:04:51.389> amount<00:04:51.449> of<00:04:51.690> sea<00:04:52.500> ice<00:04:52.819> at<00:04:53.819> any

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
decrease in the amount of sea ice at any

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.110 
decrease in the amount of sea ice at any
one<00:04:54.180> particular<00:04:54.330> point<00:04:55.139> of<00:04:55.319> time<00:04:56.060> actually<00:04:57.060> in

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
one particular point of time actually in

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.080 
one particular point of time actually in
the<00:04:57.210> Arctic<00:04:57.569> region<00:04:58.190> now<00:04:59.190> that's<00:04:59.370> important

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
the Arctic region now that's important

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.850 
the Arctic region now that's important
for<00:05:00.240> climate<00:05:00.509> change<00:05:00.900> because<00:05:01.229> of<00:05:01.349> feedbacks

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
for climate change because of feedbacks

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.450 
for climate change because of feedbacks
at<00:05:02.699> sea<00:05:02.969> ice<00:05:03.560> which<00:05:04.560> is<00:05:04.590> the<00:05:04.770> same<00:05:04.979> color<00:05:05.250> as

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
at sea ice which is the same color as

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.149 
at sea ice which is the same color as
this<00:05:05.580> snowy<00:05:05.940> here<00:05:06.389> of<00:05:06.870> course<00:05:07.199> is<00:05:07.680> able<00:05:07.919> to

00:05:08.149 --> 00:05:08.159 
this snowy here of course is able to

00:05:08.159 --> 00:05:10.610 
this snowy here of course is able to
reflect<00:05:08.639> sunlight<00:05:08.969> it<00:05:09.659> has<00:05:09.870> an<00:05:09.990> albiet<00:05:10.409> high

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
reflect sunlight it has an albiet high

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:14.149 
reflect sunlight it has an albiet high
albedo<00:05:11.780> meaning<00:05:12.780> it<00:05:12.870> just<00:05:13.050> it's<00:05:13.289> it<00:05:13.590> reflects

00:05:14.149 --> 00:05:14.159 
albedo meaning it just it's it reflects

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:15.680 
albedo meaning it just it's it reflects
the<00:05:14.280> sunlight<00:05:14.490> back<00:05:14.849> out<00:05:15.030> into<00:05:15.449> the

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 
the sunlight back out into the

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.469 
the sunlight back out into the
atmosphere<00:05:15.780> and<00:05:16.169> into<00:05:16.319> space<00:05:16.969> so<00:05:17.969> it<00:05:18.090> has<00:05:18.270> a

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 
atmosphere and into space so it has a

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:21.469 
atmosphere and into space so it has a
direct<00:05:19.469> effect<00:05:19.919> on<00:05:20.069> on<00:05:20.580> the<00:05:21.060> Earth's<00:05:21.240> climate

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 
direct effect on on the Earth's climate

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:24.740 
direct effect on on the Earth's climate
system<00:05:21.719> in<00:05:22.169> that<00:05:22.650> it<00:05:22.979> is<00:05:23.280> it<00:05:24.090> leads<00:05:24.300> to<00:05:24.419> a

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:24.750 
system in that it is it leads to a

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:26.839 
system in that it is it leads to a
cooling<00:05:25.080> because<00:05:25.590> the<00:05:26.009> sun's<00:05:26.280> energy<00:05:26.460> is

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:26.849 
cooling because the sun's energy is

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:28.450 
cooling because the sun's energy is
actually<00:05:27.090> reflected<00:05:27.599> back<00:05:27.780> off<00:05:27.810> into<00:05:28.139> space

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
actually reflected back off into space

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.480 
actually reflected back off into space
now<00:05:29.460> if<00:05:30.449> you<00:05:31.110> diminish<00:05:31.680> the<00:05:31.919> amount<00:05:32.190> of<00:05:32.280> sea

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
now if you diminish the amount of sea

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.700 
now if you diminish the amount of sea
ice<00:05:32.520> then<00:05:32.969> this<00:05:33.539> that<00:05:33.870> has<00:05:34.110> this<00:05:34.229> cooling

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
ice then this that has this cooling

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.769 
ice then this that has this cooling
effect<00:05:35.069> on<00:05:35.310> the<00:05:35.490> Earth's<00:05:35.699> climate<00:05:35.819> and<00:05:36.240> you

00:05:36.769 --> 00:05:36.779 
effect on the Earth's climate and you

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:41.180 
effect on the Earth's climate and you
open<00:05:37.199> it<00:05:37.319> up<00:05:37.440> to<00:05:37.710> dark<00:05:38.069> water<00:05:39.469> which<00:05:40.469> and<00:05:40.740> dark

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
open it up to dark water which and dark

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.999 
open it up to dark water which and dark
of<00:05:41.430> dark<00:05:41.759> colors<00:05:42.120> has<00:05:42.419> a<00:05:42.449> low<00:05:42.930> albedo<00:05:43.259> so<00:05:43.889> it

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:44.009 
of dark colors has a low albedo so it

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:46.339 
of dark colors has a low albedo so it
can<00:05:44.159> absorb<00:05:44.279> the<00:05:45.029> sun's<00:05:45.270> energy<00:05:45.419> then<00:05:46.169> that

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:46.349 
can absorb the sun's energy then that

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:48.140 
can absorb the sun's energy then that
means<00:05:46.560> the<00:05:46.740> ocean<00:05:47.039> will<00:05:47.190> warm<00:05:47.490> up<00:05:47.699> so<00:05:48.029> much

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
means the ocean will warm up so much

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.269 
means the ocean will warm up so much
more<00:05:48.419> than<00:05:48.779> if<00:05:49.050> there<00:05:49.380> was<00:05:49.500> sea<00:05:49.680> ice<00:05:49.830> covering

00:05:50.269 --> 00:05:50.279 
more than if there was sea ice covering

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:52.879 
more than if there was sea ice covering
it<00:05:50.430> which<00:05:51.180> means<00:05:51.419> of<00:05:51.539> course<00:05:51.569> it<00:05:52.050> contributes

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:52.889 
it which means of course it contributes

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:55.550 
it which means of course it contributes
to<00:05:53.310> our<00:05:53.580> worries<00:05:54.150> about<00:05:54.389> global<00:05:55.050> warming<00:05:55.080> and
