they're gonna be now the whole thing I'm
a<00:00:22.590> time<00:00:22.950> traveler<00:00:23.430> when<00:00:24.210> I<00:00:24.239> was<00:00:24.509> I'm<00:00:24.899> stuck<00:00:25.590> in

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
a time traveler when I was I'm stuck in

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.550 

people<00:00:45.030> don't<00:00:45.330> understand<00:00:45.780> time<00:00:46.140> it's<00:00:46.410> not

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:46.560 
people don't understand time it's not

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.620 
people don't understand time it's not
what<00:00:46.830> you<00:00:46.890> think<00:00:46.950> it<00:00:47.190> is<00:00:48.470> complicated<00:00:50.630> very

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:51.630 
what you think it is complicated very

00:00:51.630 --> 00:01:00.020 
what you think it is complicated very
complicated<00:00:57.140> people<00:00:58.140> assume<00:00:58.650> that<00:00:59.130> time<00:00:59.580> is<00:00:59.970> a

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
complicated people assume that time is a

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.000 
complicated people assume that time is a
strict<00:01:00.540> progression<00:01:01.080> of<00:01:01.140> course<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.620> effect

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
strict progression of course to effect

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.329 
strict progression of course to effect
but<00:01:02.760> actually<00:01:03.300> from<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:03.930> nonlinear<00:01:04.440> subjective

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
but actually from a nonlinear subjective

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.460 
but actually from a nonlinear subjective
viewpoint<00:01:05.550> it's<00:01:06.270> more<00:01:06.450> of<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.600> big<00:01:07.050> board

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
viewpoint it's more of a big board

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:14.420 
viewpoint it's more of a big board
Wiggly<00:01:08.250> probably<00:01:08.640> tiney<00:01:09.540> winey<00:01:10.250> stuff<00:01:13.220> it<00:01:14.220> got

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
Wiggly probably tiney winey stuff it got

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:21.620 
Wiggly probably tiney winey stuff it got
away<00:01:14.520> from<00:01:14.670> me<00:01:14.940> yeah<00:01:17.630> well<00:01:18.630> I'm<00:01:18.720> here<00:01:20.330> well<00:01:21.330> not

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
away from me yeah well I'm here well not

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.600 
away from me yeah well I'm here well not
here<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.110> exactly<00:01:22.470> but<00:01:23.009> I<00:01:23.040> know<00:01:23.130> everything

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
here you exactly but I know everything

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:37.870 
here you exactly but I know everything
you're<00:01:23.940> going<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.210> say<00:01:27.080> look<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.229> left

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.280 

I'm<00:01:38.880> going<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.090> copy<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.479> Finnish<00:01:39.690> transcript

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
I'm going to copy the Finnish transcript

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.570 
I'm going to copy the Finnish transcript
Tom<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:40.890> autocue<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:43.130> told<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.220> I'm<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.370> time

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:44.580 
Tom I autocue I told you I'm a time

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:52.130 
Tom I autocue I told you I'm a time
traveler<00:01:44.909> got<00:01:45.300> in<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.510> future<00:01:51.140> maybe

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
traveler got in the future maybe

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.510 
traveler got in the future maybe
probably<00:01:52.880> timing<00:01:53.880> climbing<00:01:55.220> what<00:01:56.220> matters<00:01:56.490> is

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
probably timing climbing what matters is

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.670 
probably timing climbing what matters is
we<00:01:56.880> can<00:01:57.030> communicate<00:01:57.380> we've<00:01:58.380> got<00:01:58.500> big

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
we can communicate we've got big

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.010 
we can communicate we've got big
problems<00:01:58.710> now<00:01:59.280> they've<00:02:00.090> taken<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.600> blue<00:02:00.750> box

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
problems now they've taken the blue box

you see them and lonely assassins they

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.790 
you see them and lonely assassins they
used<00:02:18.060> to<00:02:18.120> be<00:02:18.239> called<00:02:18.450> and<00:02:19.080> quite<00:02:19.350> knows<00:02:19.590> where

used to be called and quite knows where

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.250 
used to be called and quite knows where
they<00:02:19.890> came<00:02:20.130> from<00:02:20.190> but<00:02:20.750> they're<00:02:21.750> as<00:02:21.900> old<00:02:22.020> as<00:02:22.230> the

of course a stone cold clear either well

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.970 
of course a stone cold clear either well
then<00:02:48.000> you<00:02:48.090> turn<00:02:48.299> your<00:02:48.480> head<00:02:48.690> away<00:02:48.810> and<00:02:49.739> you

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
then you turn your head away and you

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:56.240 
then you turn your head away and you
blink<00:02:51.080> no<00:02:52.080> yes<00:02:52.380> he<00:02:52.560> can<00:02:55.010> that's<00:02:56.010> why<00:02:56.130> they

blink no yes he can that's why they

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.920 
blink no yes he can that's why they
cover<00:02:56.430> their<00:02:56.579> eyes<00:02:56.610> and<00:02:57.239> they're<00:02:57.360> not<00:02:57.450> weeping
