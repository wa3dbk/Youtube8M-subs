00:00:00.749 --> 00:00:02.830
 hello in this video will be about 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:04.510
 catch potassium case 

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:06.160
 we have him a penny 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.470
 these systems are 581 this kind of turnover 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.470
 system 30 

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:16.439
 this myth 5 scare 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:19.439
 also priests plastic 

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:24.739
 sd card slot 

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:26.719
 all other connectors rely 

00:00:26.719 --> 00:00:30.109
 the other day China 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:31.199
 there are 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.210
 alarm inputs outputs 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.210
 output for analogue saw 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.820
 power adapter output 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.820
 network connector rj 45 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.860
 further reboot the camera 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.700
 it allowed 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.050
 he is the power indicator 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.720
 now let's sign that 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.620
 let's see gives autotor here first 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.799
 the queue will call up with the video settings 

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:01.050
 for this we proceed to the construction 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.720
 where you immediately go to the camera settings and 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:04.910
 here we can install 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.900
 clean source of artificial 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.680
 lighting regulate 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.570
 automatically focus 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.320
 adjust the range of motion 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.360
 choosing a parameter from zero to 90 degrees and 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.250
 dominoes under zero and 120 degrees 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.480
 there is also a return at the construction site 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.109
 PTZ cameras to home position 

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:26.099
 we can chose to go out specify time 

00:01:26.099 --> 00:01:28.929
 through which the camera will return to the specified 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:32.400
 position and specify the position 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.720
 also here you can adjust 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.240
 fast garden thief here we can choose 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.530
 speed from one thirty seconds yes 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.730
 one thousand seconds 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.900
 go to the audio tab here when 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.630
 if necessary we can turn on the output 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.090
 adjust the sound to turn on or 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.520
 turn off I have him enter 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.300
 adjust sensitivity 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.530
 microphone and mute function during 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.180
 camera rotation time 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.390
 now we are going to build video streams 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:03.950
 here we are given a choice 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.909
 the following characteristics for 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.069
 each of the permissions listed here we 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.440
 we can specify the frame rate choosing from 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.119
 five 

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:13.579
 up to thirty frames per second 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:15.459
 also we can for each of these 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.019
 permissions 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:18.989
 choose the maximum bit rate 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.329
 but here for Jesus cancer at 480 is available 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:25.769
 maximum bitrate 2 megabits 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.019
 for 320 and 241 megabits 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:33.329
 and for 190 two per 144 megabytes per second 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:36.719
 here we can also specify the port of Avkeriev 

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:37.469
 the back 

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:40.069
 and porter now 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:41.479
 now redistribute settings 

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:42.749
 user 

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:44.269
 here, if necessary, you can 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:45.529
 create users 

00:02:45.529 --> 00:02:48.059
 click on the create button go name 

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:49.359

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:55.839
 and save 

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:57.909
 maximum number of user who 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:00.219
 can recreate this 50 all in the chamber 

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:02.349
 there are motion detector in 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.029
 its settings are included 

00:03:04.029 --> 00:03:06.289
 setting the detection threshold 

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:07.839
 and setting sensitivity 

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:09.369
 detections 

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:12.349
 rebuild first in picture settings 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:15.629
 camera adjust refresh rate 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:17.399
 where can we choose 

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:20.209
 us so ngp km and from three to six ten 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.399
 seconds image resolution where we are 

00:03:23.399 --> 00:03:26.249
 we can choose to get 92 tail 44 to 

00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:30.289
 holes 640 anna 480 image quality 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.839
 similar at the construction site are present 

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:36.789
 and parameter require cameras 

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:39.909
 also in this section we can choose a language 

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:41.330
 and set up 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.270
 farman date and time if necessary 

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.459
 can be displayed on the image text 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:47.829
 also present here 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:50.149
 network settings 

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:52.569
 ii beer 4 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:55.289
 network settings and drank 6 

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:57.479
 settings and pink pink 

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:59.409
 setting dynamic c on s 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:02.409
 at the construction date and time 

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:05.879
 admin at the construction site settings 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:07.849
 time working 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:10.849
 in the management of the indicator 

00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:14.799
 Now let's move to the view mode and here it is 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:17.620
 watching it in real time 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.379
 we can choose permissions 

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:23.129
 we can choose quality 

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:25.689
 we can specify the update frequency 

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:28.249
 adjust white balance can include 

00:04:28.249 --> 00:04:30.969
 backlight collection 

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:33.969
 adjust focus 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:45.119
 also we can rotate the camera 

00:04:45.119 --> 00:04:46.789
 if necessary turning speed 

00:04:46.789 --> 00:04:47.919
 cameras 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:48.939
 tourists 

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:51.949
 degrees second horizontally 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:54.949
 and 200 degrees second vertically 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:57.610
 now you can see how it is 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.020
 looks like 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.550
 and indicate already pre-filled 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.550
 image positions 

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:17.289
 the camera has a double zoom period 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:19.529
 June 20 multiple optical zoom and 

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:20.739
 double digital
