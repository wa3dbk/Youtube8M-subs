00:00:04.002 --> 00:00:07.001
Letâ€™s taste the Amarone Classico.

00:00:09.002 --> 00:00:13.001
This wine comes from the best vineyards 
in the Valpolicella valley.

00:00:14.002 --> 00:00:19.001
Here, we have a grapes composition 
including also a small part of Molinara.

00:00:19.002 --> 00:00:23.001
The colour of this wine is splendid,

00:00:23.002 --> 00:00:33.001
deep ruby red with light orange hints.

00:00:33.002 --> 00:00:39.001
The wine has an excellent texture , 
and globally the appearance of the wine 

00:00:40.002 --> 00:00:46.001
invite the consumer to taste it and this fact is very positive. 

00:00:49.002 --> 00:00:54.001
The bouquet of this wine is direct, with fruity perception, 
intense of ripe fruit and light notes of jam,

00:00:56.002 --> 00:01:03.001
where plums and cherries prevail over a delicate red wildberries tones.

00:01:09.002 --> 00:01:14.001
Acidity is pleasant, we can feel some black berry, 
cassis and ripe rasberry.

00:01:15.002 --> 00:01:21.001
The undertone is balsamic and spiced, elegant,
refined, intense in the right amount,

00:01:23.002 --> 00:01:30.001
with a distinctive trait of vanilla who makes 
the wine harmonic and uniform.

00:01:30.002 --> 00:01:38.001
Moreover there is a really pleasant bouquet, elegant, 
and very well accepted even from the most demanding consumer.

00:01:46.002 --> 00:01:52.001
Tasting this wine, we note it is full bodied, 
harmonic, very elegant

00:01:52.002 --> 00:01:57.001
Twith tannins still modelling where we feel that the oak is mixing.

00:01:58.002 --> 00:02:06.001
Then a round final, pleasant, full of fruit, 
harmonic between nose and mouth, a long persistence.

00:02:07.002 --> 00:02:15.001
This wine goes well when you eat food with some oily notes, 
some fat, for example venison,

00:02:15.002 --> 00:02:25.001
or long cooked red meat or cheeses with a long maturation 
and high tones in term of concentration.

00:02:29.002 --> 00:02:34.001
Very agreeable the full fruit and the pansy smell,
who is intense and very pleasant also in the nose,

00:02:37.002 --> 00:02:42.001
and this makes Amarone a wine so enjoyable 
and ready on many circumstances.
