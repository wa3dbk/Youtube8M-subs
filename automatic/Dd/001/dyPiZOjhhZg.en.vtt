00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.120
 I believe me soft brush that I put 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.800

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:02.670
 after I just take that I put 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.950
 the second I put it with games but 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:10.380
 also grace to his skin I cross them 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:14.340

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:18.180
 smell it sucks here so there is everything there 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:20.130
 is the place after September 10th or the 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:27.300
 time it depends 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:29.730
 after me I'm rather doing it because 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:33.600
 that's suddenly it hurts less of 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.890
 subscribers you understand I'm going to get some 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:43.260
 strollers 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:49.080
 American meadow after I think about 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:53.490
 rethink perfect after I take my 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:56.250
 boss so here today the here 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:04:04.830
 so it's to bring with it a little 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:08.070
 cool and sedan so here is young man is 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:11.040
 there after I think we touch the austere 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:14.280
 so I put like that then the pico 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.079
 vernon pro borloo rather than a point 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.019
 diaconal because the brush 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:21.209
 after this one I had put the fangs 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:24.710
 down like that so yes me no I 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:26.790
 can blame me like that after we 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.860
 no time is left for me instead 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.540
 I withdraw it would pass like that I 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.669
 always winning and I know what 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.590
 place I have left and that I return it 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:36.960
 before shawn is there for me to do 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.450
 the game but I always put it here if I 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:53.520
 left my zone 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:54.720
 I think this is not because a 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:59.669
 simple joker it's because I had my 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:09.930
