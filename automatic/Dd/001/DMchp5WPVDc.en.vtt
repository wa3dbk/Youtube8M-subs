00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:07.939
 I'm a medical doctor and I'm a computer and robotics teacher. 

00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:12.659
 and today I'm going to teach them how we have art communication technology 

00:00:12.659 --> 00:00:13.749
 bluetooth 

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:15.459
 to send and receive 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:18.459
 information if something consistent in giving up 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:23.749
 we can send complete schedules or just adjustments 

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:27.939
 and want to know in real time the readings perpetuated on each bike of theft 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:30.659
 with the measures in question 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:31.930
 the first step 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.930
 is to connect the robot creation to the bluetooth 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.430
 now in the desktop suffer from this problem after selecting years the 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.050
 move component 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.050
 we have to believe in each other 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.690
 still measures 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.900
 then we ask the software to make the connection 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.250
 stole it in test 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.510
 viaducts 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.080
 locate the flight 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.800
 and clicking connect 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.060
 the software prompts you for a password that by default is 1 2 3 4 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.600
 clicking here 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.990
 My love, you give me a beep. 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.990
 just confirm by pressing the orange steal button 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.630
 very well in real time we can observe how the whole battery is in relation to 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:26.600
 your load 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.680
 ouagadougou is offline 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.480
 we still have the option to see verify 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.360
 the memory of fear 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.650
 here in this blue band are the programs installed in the group memory 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.520
 with our missions 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.690
 there is still a graphic field 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.740
 we can not use a component 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.760
 is a tool on the maniche side was near 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.580
 analyzing is all from theft data 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.520
 when this movement 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.700
 taking a graph 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.880
 so that we can capture and analyze in the future 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.409
 this is the free space of incomprehensible memory what 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.190
 we are consuming more than half of the people's memory 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.400
 they already want it 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.729
 Let's go another step. 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.729
 very well is not the custom of poor products of theft 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:16.309
 - we have real-time information 

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:18.209
 in relation to the reading of the motors 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:22.260
 I realize that here is very rock winning are in the two crashes training 

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:28.909
 so I'm going to start the theft traction engine we'll see 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.069
 reading real time miguel 

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:36.869
 realize that we have here readings 

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:40.209
 the own aircraft which means positive goals 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.209
 I'm going to move the group's claw now 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:46.149
 he put it in the air 

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:49.149
 he spoke positively 92 degrees 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:52.819
 and I'll show you now 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.319
 is an option we have to reset this information 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.859
 just click the component to run 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:02.229
 the author except all information 

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:05.589
 right now I'm going to test negative values 

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:07.299
 certainly the deco 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.729
 the correct is nothing mission 

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:10.799
 not seeing here 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.799
 we have some information 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:16.329
 means negative value 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.059
 Paul is staying here. 

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:21.449
 I hope everyone will make the most of this new technique for cinema. 

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:23.089
 gugu programming 

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.639
 See you
