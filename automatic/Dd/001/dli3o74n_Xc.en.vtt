00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
there's a three so this is very possibly

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.220 
there's a three so this is very possibly
a<00:01:43.200> trilogy<00:01:44.300> so

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:46.230

four three two one go so that's really

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.400 
four three two one go so that's really
great<00:03:22.330> to<00:03:22.480> know<00:03:23.190> after<00:03:24.569> 402<00:03:25.569> is<00:03:25.599> gets<00:03:26.140> 2

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
great to know after 402 is gets 2

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.089

headshots<00:03:26.880> the<00:03:27.880> player<00:03:28.120> we<00:03:28.569> see<00:03:28.900> takes<00:03:29.799> a<00:03:29.890> pro

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:30.099 
headshots the player we see takes a pro

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:32.130 
headshots the player we see takes a pro
knife<00:03:30.430> and<00:03:30.819> it's<00:03:30.940> a<00:03:31.060> one-shot<00:03:31.299> kill<00:03:31.870> every

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
knife and it's a one-shot kill every

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.930 
knife and it's a one-shot kill every
time<00:03:32.319> basically<00:03:32.980> think<00:03:33.220> of<00:03:33.280> a<00:03:33.400> knife<00:03:33.610> but<00:03:33.910> a

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
time basically think of a knife but a

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.020 
time basically think of a knife but a
knife<00:03:34.239> long<00:03:34.840> range<00:03:35.140> it<00:03:36.010> probably<00:03:36.849> I'm

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
knife long range it probably I'm

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.199 
knife long range it probably I'm
thinking<00:03:37.660> it<00:03:37.959> probably<00:03:38.860> removes<00:03:39.280> your

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
thinking it probably removes your

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.620 
thinking it probably removes your
ability<00:03:41.079> to<00:03:41.200> do<00:03:41.319> a<00:03:41.349> melee<00:03:41.650> attack<00:03:42.040> so<00:03:42.670> if<00:03:43.510> you

ability to do a melee attack so if you

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:44.729

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.480 
with a throwing knife also something i
noticed<00:03:58.920> which<00:03:59.370> is<00:03:59.580> really<00:04:00.300> cool<00:04:00.510> is<00:04:01.430> look<00:04:02.430> at

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:02.490 
noticed which is really cool is look at

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.150 
noticed which is really cool is look at
the<00:04:02.580> map<00:04:02.850> on<00:04:03.030> the<00:04:03.150> side<00:04:03.390> it's<00:04:03.990> a<00:04:04.170> static<00:04:04.860> so

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
the map on the side it's a static so

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.250 
the map on the side it's a static so
it's<00:04:05.370> being<00:04:05.580> jammed<00:04:05.910> their<00:04:06.240> blog<00:04:06.510> somehow<00:04:06.960> and

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
it's being jammed their blog somehow and

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.090 
it's being jammed their blog somehow and
the<00:04:08.100> moment<00:04:08.550> he<00:04:08.610> kills<00:04:08.940> the<00:04:09.180> sniper<00:04:09.560> BAM<00:04:10.560> the

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
the moment he kills the sniper BAM the

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.450 
the moment he kills the sniper BAM the
maps<00:04:11.340> back<00:04:11.640> online<00:04:11.880> so<00:04:12.510> obviously<00:04:13.230> a<00:04:13.590> player

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:14.460 
maps back online so obviously a player

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.060 
maps back online so obviously a player
can<00:04:14.940> hold<00:04:15.270> something<00:04:15.780> that<00:04:15.960> actually

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
can hold something that actually

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.490 
can hold something that actually
scrambles<00:04:17.070> an<00:04:17.310> int<00:04:18.180> an<00:04:18.450> entire<00:04:18.810> map<00:04:19.200> of

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
scrambles an int an entire map of

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.110 
scrambles an int an entire map of
someone<00:04:19.830> maybe<00:04:20.130> when<00:04:20.340> you're<00:04:20.489> in<00:04:20.580> like<00:04:20.760> a

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
someone maybe when you're in like a

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.860 
someone maybe when you're in like a
certain<00:04:21.720> like<00:04:22.190> perimeter<00:04:23.190> around<00:04:23.550> the<00:04:23.870> around

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
certain like perimeter around the around

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.810 
certain like perimeter around the around
that<00:04:25.110> player<00:04:25.380> your<00:04:25.920> map<00:04:26.070> will<00:04:26.220> go<00:04:26.340> all<00:04:26.430> fuzzy

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
that player your map will go all fuzzy

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.780 
that player your map will go all fuzzy
the<00:04:27.120> moment<00:04:27.300> he<00:04:27.480> dies<00:04:27.630> and<00:04:28.140> I<00:04:28.560> have<00:04:29.520> back
