00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.210
 hello to all I find today 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.039
 for a new said heil discover 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.240
 together how to make crop top 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.240
 different is gone 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:28.000
 at the hardware level you need everything 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.750
 simply a tank top or a t-shirt and 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.750
 a pair of scissors 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.480
 so we start with unibail and 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.640
 strips one centimeter wide 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.800
 about and at the level of the length 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.940
 stop the cuts at the level of 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:51.840
 below your chest 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.840
 so at that level pretty much 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.090
 loans 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.570
 all 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.860
 and 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.060
 he 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.600
 once we finish cutting 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.980
 all the bands we will come the 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.960
 feed each other so we 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:09.610
 take them two by two and we come 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:11.820
 to do not every time with our 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.820
 bands 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.239
 a first nine 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:31.290
 second do not always with the same two 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:34.110
 strips of fabric and we will continue as 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.270
 these and so on with the tapes 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.930
 next we'll catch two by 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:43.880
 two and that we will play twice 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.880
 each time with each other 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:42.730
 so here I am finishing my 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:46.510
 first row of noeux here is that 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.140
 gives us a closer look and so we're going 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.320
 restart 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:58.450
 we now have two slats of 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:04:01.510
 fabric by next to the same and so we're going 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.790
 take a coverslip that is on this 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:07.800
 9th and one on this one and we will come 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.800
 May may with each other 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.769
 and still doing May 2 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.380
 e 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:38.030
 here 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.970
 so I still have a sliver on this 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.580
 take it and I will come the year with 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:01.419
 one of the two slats that is on 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.419
 the next nine 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:10.360
 and there I speak of knots with these 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.360
 two there even 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:29.440
 here and so I will continue as 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:31.560
 these so on until I 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.520
 completely go around my 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.919
 tank top so I take the coverslip 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.569
 remaining on my node I take a 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:41.770
 of the two slats that is on the 

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:45.659
 knot next door is frozen us one with 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.659
 the other by making knots 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:07.349
 so here's for the option a top cig 

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:09.539
 number one is that it gives us a 

00:07:07.349 --> 00:07:12.840
 Once we have finished the second row 

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:14.909
 a small tank top with fringes 

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:16.740
 that I find rather nice 

00:07:14.909 --> 00:07:18.210
 if you ever want something 

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:21.469
 shorter I find right away 

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:21.469
 for option 2 

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:29.430
 so you just have to make two 

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:31.789
 rows of extra nuts on the 

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:35.009
 tank top and become cut off the excess 

00:07:31.789 --> 00:07:38.130
 of pivot slats stays in order to get 

00:07:35.009 --> 00:07:40.550
 a little bone that will look like a 

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:40.550
 bra 

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:51.690
 and so that's what it puts me once 

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:53.940
 we finished the cuts 

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:55.800
 I hope these two you open fast 

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:58.050
 you have been useful to you 

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.740
 do not hesitate to share this video if 

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:00.090
 you feel like it 

00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:01.530
 me on my side I find you very 

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:03.800
 quickly for a new tutorial I you 

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:03.800
 kisses
