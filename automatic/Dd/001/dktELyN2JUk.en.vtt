00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
curve and I really don't know what to

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.879 
curve and I really don't know what to
think<00:00:08.700> about<00:00:08.970> this<00:00:09.170> Samsung<00:00:10.170> has<00:00:10.230> done<00:00:10.590> curved

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
think about this Samsung has done curved

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.560 
think about this Samsung has done curved
displays<00:00:11.250> before<00:00:11.670> they<00:00:11.849> did<00:00:12.030> one<00:00:12.210> on<00:00:12.240> the

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
displays before they did one on the

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.060 
displays before they did one on the
Nexus<00:00:12.960> S<00:00:13.139> although<00:00:13.410> is<00:00:13.559> much<00:00:13.860> more

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
Nexus S although is much more

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.799 
Nexus S although is much more
understated<00:00:14.580> and<00:00:14.790> really<00:00:15.210> you<00:00:15.299> can<00:00:15.330> actually

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
understated and really you can actually

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.109 
understated and really you can actually
tell<00:00:16.020> it<00:00:16.199> was<00:00:16.320> there<00:00:16.560> this<00:00:17.190> one<00:00:17.430> is<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.730> lot

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
tell it was there this one is a lot

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.640 
tell it was there this one is a lot
different<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.600> if<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:18.810> just<00:00:19.020> scroll<00:00:19.260> down<00:00:19.289> here

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
different and if I just scroll down here

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.050 
different and if I just scroll down here
you<00:00:19.710> can<00:00:19.830> see<00:00:19.980> another<00:00:20.279> picture<00:00:20.580> of<00:00:20.699> it<00:00:20.910> which

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
you can see another picture of it which

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.939 
you can see another picture of it which
kind<00:00:21.330> of<00:00:21.390> makes<00:00:21.539> it<00:00:21.660> look<00:00:21.810> even<00:00:21.960> more<00:00:22.650> curved

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
kind of makes it look even more curved

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.920 
kind of makes it look even more curved
and<00:00:23.189> you<00:00:23.670> can<00:00:23.820> just<00:00:23.970> see<00:00:24.029> how<00:00:24.330> curved<00:00:24.600> it<00:00:24.779> looks

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
and you can just see how curved it looks

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.269 
and you can just see how curved it looks
now<00:00:25.080> I<00:00:25.109> don't<00:00:25.380> know<00:00:25.439> how<00:00:25.590> this<00:00:25.740> is<00:00:25.800> going<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.130> be

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
now I don't know how this is going to be

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:28.609 
now I don't know how this is going to be
now<00:00:26.550> thinking<00:00:27.420> about<00:00:27.630> it<00:00:27.779> your<00:00:28.019> hand<00:00:28.260> is<00:00:28.380> kind

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
now thinking about it your hand is kind

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.679 
now thinking about it your hand is kind
of<00:00:28.710> curved<00:00:28.920> when<00:00:29.130> you<00:00:29.220> hold<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.519> device<00:00:29.789> so<00:00:30.420> it

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
of curved when you hold a device so it

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.240 
of curved when you hold a device so it
probably<00:00:31.080> is<00:00:31.320> going<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.560> feel<00:00:31.679> nice<00:00:31.920> in<00:00:32.160> your

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
probably is going to feel nice in your

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.799 
probably is going to feel nice in your
hand<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:32.969> really<00:00:33.180> is<00:00:33.360> going<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.570> be<00:00:33.660> one<00:00:33.780> of

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
hand and it really is going to be one of

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.180 
hand and it really is going to be one of
those<00:00:33.960> devices<00:00:34.290> that<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:34.710> do<00:00:34.890> have<00:00:35.010> to<00:00:35.160> have

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
those devices that you do have to have

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.770 
those devices that you do have to have
in<00:00:35.550> your<00:00:35.579> hand<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:36.000> actually<00:00:36.300> kind<00:00:36.450> of<00:00:36.600> make<00:00:36.750> a

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
in your hand to actually kind of make a

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.020 
in your hand to actually kind of make a
judgement<00:00:37.290> on<00:00:37.350> it<00:00:37.530> I<00:00:37.680> feel<00:00:38.579> it<00:00:38.730> might<00:00:38.910> be

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
judgement on it I feel it might be

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.060 
judgement on it I feel it might be
slightly<00:00:39.329> awkward<00:00:39.600> in<00:00:40.020> your<00:00:40.200> jeans<00:00:40.469> pocket<00:00:40.620> or

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
slightly awkward in your jeans pocket or

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.350 
slightly awkward in your jeans pocket or
maybe<00:00:41.250> even<00:00:41.370> when<00:00:41.700> you<00:00:41.790> hold<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.090> up<00:00:42.149> to<00:00:42.329> your

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
maybe even when you hold it up to your

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.209 
maybe even when you hold it up to your
head<00:00:42.629> or<00:00:42.840> when<00:00:43.379> you're<00:00:43.530> watching<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.920> video<00:00:44.100> I

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
head or when you're watching a video I

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.979 
head or when you're watching a video I
don't<00:00:44.399> know<00:00:44.640> how<00:00:44.879> it'll<00:00:45.000> be<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.450> just<00:00:45.719> looks

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
don't know how it'll be it just looks

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.069 
don't know how it'll be it just looks
kind<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.410> strange<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.950> me<00:00:47.070> now<00:00:47.610> I<00:00:48.079> should

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
kind of strange to me now I should

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.720 
kind of strange to me now I should
mention<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.469> this<00:00:49.649> device<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:50.309> only<00:00:50.489> coming

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.670 
mention that this device is only coming
out<00:00:50.969> in<00:00:51.149> career<00:00:51.570> right<00:00:51.809> now<00:00:51.840> I'm<00:00:52.260> not<00:00:52.410> sure<00:00:52.559> if

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
out in career right now I'm not sure if

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.990 
out in career right now I'm not sure if
it's<00:00:52.710> going<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:52.949> hit<00:00:53.100> any<00:00:53.340> other<00:00:53.550> markets

right now it is only touted for Korea so

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.049 
right now it is only touted for Korea so
who<00:00:57.210> knows<00:00:57.770> essentially<00:00:58.770> it's<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.250> curved<00:00:59.670> note

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.490 
who knows essentially it's a curved note
3<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.480> can<00:01:00.600> see<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:00.809> has<00:01:00.899> a<00:01:00.960> very<00:01:01.199> similar

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
design to the note 3 and if we check out

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.910 
design to the note 3 and if we check out
the<00:01:03.390> specs<00:01:03.719> here<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:04.320> pretty<00:01:04.680> much<00:01:04.769> has

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
image this is just weird you know when I

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.179 
image this is just weird you know when I
first<00:01:39.450> saw<00:01:39.689> this<00:01:39.869> I<00:01:40.110> was<00:01:40.140> thinking<00:01:40.680> what<00:01:41.159> the

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
first saw this I was thinking what the

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.160 
first saw this I was thinking what the
hell<00:01:41.520> this<00:01:41.729> is<00:01:41.790> one<00:01:42.240> of<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.420> ugliest<00:01:42.810> things

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
hell this is one of the ugliest things

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.690 
hell this is one of the ugliest things
I've<00:01:43.380> seen<00:01:43.619> that's<00:01:43.890> just<00:01:44.070> my<00:01:44.189> opinion<00:01:44.220> i'm

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
I've seen that's just my opinion i'm

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.190 
I've seen that's just my opinion i'm
sure<00:01:44.850> some<00:01:45.090> people<00:01:45.329> with<00:01:45.450> lot<00:01:45.630> will<00:01:45.840> like<00:01:46.020> it

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
sure some people with lot will like it

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.980 
sure some people with lot will like it
after<00:01:47.070> staring<00:01:47.460> at<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:47.640> for<00:01:47.700> a<00:01:47.909> while<00:01:47.939> yeah<00:01:48.810> i

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
after staring at it for a while yeah i

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.389 
after staring at it for a while yeah i
still<00:01:49.320> think<00:01:49.500> it's<00:01:49.710> one<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.040> weirdest

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
still think it's one of the weirdest

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.249 
still think it's one of the weirdest
things<00:01:50.579> I've<00:01:50.729> seen<00:01:51.030> in<00:01:51.270> terms<00:01:51.689> of<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:51.960> mobile

display they're actually tailoring the

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.550 
display they're actually tailoring the
software<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.489> this<00:02:08.640> now<00:02:08.879> and<00:02:09.209> you<00:02:09.629> know<00:02:09.750> I'll

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
software to this now and you know I'll

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.320 
software to this now and you know I'll
put<00:02:10.830> a<00:02:10.860> video<00:02:11.069> in<00:02:11.310> here<00:02:11.520> of<00:02:11.640> what<00:02:11.790> exactly<00:02:12.120> I

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330
