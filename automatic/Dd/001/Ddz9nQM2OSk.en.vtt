00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 hello to all this video I make you 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.140
 see a recipe very much 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.849
 traditional custard also 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.469
 strangely we never have not 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.400
 we never did see their own 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.830
 a very good recipe is a very good one 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.619
 really delicious cream made easy by 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.660
 doing is completely women when you do it 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.930
 try the custard itself 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.119
 although maybe someone will say I was not 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.240
 I know it is a pastry without eggs 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.630
 I assure you it's delicious I'll show you 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.239
 right away how to do it then we put in one 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.219
 little pot our friend can 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.469
 use both the less of granoche in 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:44.280
 corn starch then make yours 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:47.219
 cream could completely fit into one 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:50.730
 beautiful mixed start to add 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:53.309
 we are milk like net milk 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.430
 of sonia you can put rice milk 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.559
 an almond milk in this case not 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.719
 It is very important that the milk is of 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.609
 because soy should not tighten does not have 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.760
 china had the bike here instead 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.100
 we usually use it in thrushes 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.990
 speaking I didn't say sugar 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.340
 we have also added the sugar of 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.430
 reed and mix well we come to put 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.890
 jumbled up 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.850
 because now we can very simple 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.850
 put on fire 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:28.160
 as you can see the exhibition created will be taken 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.830
 begins to boil off children and a 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.580
 let just cool a little 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.260
 minute 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.420
 now we can add the turmeric that 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.810
 will give a nice yellow color as if there 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:41.780
 it was just place even if just 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:45.410
 you get a strong smell of 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.330
 turmeric stay calm because i 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.140
 flavors will not be felt at all 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:53.660
 so it's guaranteed to be right 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:56.720
 rest assured that it will give substance to a color is 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:59.780
 for nothing at all you can taste it 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.030
 a little just the steam of the cream which a 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:06.830
 no one I guarantee you for 100 per 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:09.170
 hundred realize ok to finish and air a 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.600
 good aroma of thin lemons and 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.030
 just typical of custard there 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.940
 I put in some little voice giulio and without 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:21.799
 veils of lemons and this because unfortunately 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:24.890
 we didn't have the real lemons here 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:26.150
 but if you have untreated wines 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.180
 maybe even organic 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.310
 take the peel and put it together 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:35.880
 to the rest of the ingredients then while 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:39.510
 the cream is cooked over 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.130
 I find myself I went slowly but no 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.650
 as you can see the recipe is very much 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.900
 easy I went the pot is 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:49.170
 very good this is perfect too 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.570
 served with fruit with gods 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.160
 short biscuits in the cakes in the trash 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.920
 we'll make some pasta swirls 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.050
 then leavened very good, then you will see 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.080
 the video and if you want maybe 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.760
 to accompany it of the strawberries in which 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.450
 fruit to make us maybe beautiful 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.700
 tarts you can put in place of one 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.100
 part of milk replace us a little 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.340
 lemon juice or add it to the extra 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:17.550
 milk and dm really very tasty very 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.650
 the taste of lemon is much stronger though 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.600
 if you like it, it 's great 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.250
 I hope you enjoyed the recipe 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:32.090
