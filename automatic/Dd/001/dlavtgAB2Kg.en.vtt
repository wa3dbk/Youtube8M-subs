so I'm going to take a little bit of our

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.060 
so I'm going to take a little bit of our
yellow<00:00:24.570> primary<00:00:25.260> here<00:00:25.470> our<00:00:25.590> yellow<00:00:25.859> medium

more yellow into it and get our orange

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.420 
more yellow into it and get our orange
color<00:01:00.270> right<00:01:00.600> there<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:01.260> we<00:01:01.920> want<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.219> be<00:01:02.309> able

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
color right there and we want to be able

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
to have a nice clean secondary color so

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.669 
to have a nice clean secondary color so
we<00:01:05.549> move<00:01:05.700> from<00:01:05.789> that<00:01:05.939> yellow<00:01:06.210> that<00:01:06.960> crimson<00:01:07.469> to

00:01:07.669 --> 00:01:07.679

00:01:15.529 --> 00:01:15.539 
come back in and I will go a little bit

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:17.809 
come back in and I will go a little bit
more<00:01:15.979> red<00:01:16.979> I<00:01:17.009> want<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.310> make<00:01:17.399> sure<00:01:17.429> I<00:01:17.579> have

00:01:17.809 --> 00:01:17.819 
more red I want to make sure I have

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:21.769 
more red I want to make sure I have
enough<00:01:18.469> on<00:01:19.469> here<00:01:19.889> for<00:01:20.099> my<00:01:20.189> mixture<00:01:20.639> now<00:01:21.599> if<00:01:21.719> I

00:01:21.769 --> 00:01:21.779 
enough on here for my mixture now if I

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:23.239 
enough on here for my mixture now if I
was<00:01:21.929> to<00:01:22.049> do<00:01:22.170> this<00:01:22.349> with<00:01:22.499> I<00:01:22.590> say<00:01:22.829> a<00:01:22.859> cadmium

00:01:23.239 --> 00:01:23.249 
was to do this with I say a cadmium

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:25.669 
was to do this with I say a cadmium
yellow<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:23.999> a<00:01:24.060> cadmium<00:01:24.299> red<00:01:24.749> and<00:01:25.139> and<00:01:25.289> a

yellow and a cadmium red and and a
cobalt<00:01:26.130> blue<00:01:26.329> they<00:01:27.329> wouldn't<00:01:27.630> give<00:01:27.810> me<00:01:27.840> the

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:28.219 
cobalt blue they wouldn't give me the

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:30.949 
cobalt blue they wouldn't give me the
brightest<00:01:29.219> mixtures<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:29.999> I<00:01:30.029> would<00:01:30.359> really<00:01:30.599> I

00:01:30.949 --> 00:01:30.959 
brightest mixtures that I would really I

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:33.709 
brightest mixtures that I would really I
would<00:01:31.439> really<00:01:31.649> want<00:01:32.039> cadmium<00:01:32.939> colors<00:01:33.270> tend<00:01:33.569> to

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:33.719 
would really want cadmium colors tend to

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:36.230 
would really want cadmium colors tend to
give<00:01:33.899> you<00:01:34.049> mixtures<00:01:34.499> that<00:01:34.679> approximate<00:01:35.249> more

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
give you mixtures that approximate more

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.760 
give you mixtures that approximate more
natural<00:01:36.719> light<00:01:36.899> they<00:01:37.109> were<00:01:37.169> favored<00:01:37.590> by<00:01:37.619> the

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
natural light they were favored by the

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.769 
natural light they were favored by the
Impressionists<00:01:38.459> and<00:01:38.579> while<00:01:39.060> that's<00:01:39.240> well

00:01:39.769 --> 00:01:39.779 
Impressionists and while that's well

00:01:39.779 --> 00:01:41.239 
Impressionists and while that's well
that's<00:01:39.990> quite<00:01:40.139> nice<00:01:40.529> they<00:01:40.799> don't<00:01:40.829> give<00:01:41.099> you

00:01:41.239 --> 00:01:41.249 
that's quite nice they don't give you

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:43.219 
that's quite nice they don't give you
always<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.880> brightest<00:01:42.329> of<00:01:42.479> mixtures<00:01:42.840> and

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
always the brightest of mixtures and

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.209 
always the brightest of mixtures and
I'll<00:01:43.560> take<00:01:43.740> some<00:01:43.829> phthalo<00:01:44.219> blue<00:01:44.249> and<00:01:45.169> now<00:01:46.219> with

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:47.219 
I'll take some phthalo blue and now with

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:49.219 
I'll take some phthalo blue and now with
