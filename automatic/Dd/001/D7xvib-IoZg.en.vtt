00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:52.650 
before you try and do the backflip and

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.860 
before you try and do the backflip and
the<00:00:53.100> first<00:00:53.370> thing<00:00:53.640> is<00:00:53.910> optional<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.660> that's

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
the first thing is optional and that's

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:03.259 
the first thing is optional and that's
the<00:00:55.019> back<00:00:55.199> salt<00:01:00.140> and<00:01:01.580> the<00:01:02.580> second<00:01:02.940> thing<00:01:03.120> is<00:01:03.210> a

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
the back salt and the second thing is a

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:05.660 
the back salt and the second thing is a
bit<00:01:03.300> of<00:01:03.479> arm<00:01:03.690> strength<00:01:03.780> um<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:05.280> way<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.460> know

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
bit of arm strength um the way you know

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.399 
bit of arm strength um the way you know
if<00:01:05.790> you've<00:01:05.909> got<00:01:05.940> enough<00:01:06.240> arm<00:01:06.510> strength<00:01:06.810> is<00:01:07.049> you

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
if you've got enough arm strength is you

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.530 
if you've got enough arm strength is you
jump<00:01:07.680> into<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:07.920> handstand<00:01:08.310> if<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.120> can<00:01:09.240> hold<00:01:09.360> it

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
jump into a handstand if you can hold it

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.630 
jump into a handstand if you can hold it
without<00:01:09.750> collapsing<00:01:10.320> then<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:11.430> should<00:01:11.580> be

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
without collapsing then you should be

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:21.030 
without collapsing then you should be
fine

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.680 

so<00:01:22.040> moving<00:01:22.430> on<00:01:22.550> to<00:01:22.580> the<00:01:22.790> first<00:01:23.030> drill<00:01:23.390> it's

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
so moving on to the first drill it's

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.230 
so moving on to the first drill it's
gonna<00:01:23.930> be<00:01:24.170> a<00:01:24.409> backwards<00:01:25.220> kick<00:01:25.490> over<00:01:25.760> I<00:01:25.880> don't

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
gonna be a backwards kick over I don't

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.640 
gonna be a backwards kick over I don't
know<00:01:26.360> what<00:01:26.479> it's<00:01:26.600> actually<00:01:26.720> called<00:01:26.930> but<00:01:27.409> arm

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
and arm basically what this is it's a

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:45.490 
and arm basically what this is it's a
back<00:01:43.759> flip<00:01:44.060> just<00:01:44.390> without<00:01:44.630> jumping<00:01:44.930> and<00:01:45.380> in

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
back flip just without jumping and in

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.990 
back flip just without jumping and in
slow<00:01:45.740> motion<00:01:45.770> and<00:01:46.490> you've<00:01:46.610> got<00:01:46.759> much<00:01:46.970> more

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
slow motion and you've got much more

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.870 
slow motion and you've got much more
control<00:01:47.630> over<00:01:47.869> yourself<00:01:47.990> so<00:01:48.790> you're<00:01:49.790> not

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
control over yourself so you're not

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.270 
control over yourself so you're not
going<00:01:50.000> to<00:01:50.090> be<00:01:50.180> scared<00:01:50.240> of<00:01:50.570> doing<00:01:50.900> it<00:01:50.990> and<00:01:51.280> when

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
going to be scared of doing it and when

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.920 
going to be scared of doing it and when
you<00:01:52.399> actually<00:01:52.580> come<00:01:52.910> to<00:01:53.090> doing<00:01:53.360> the<00:01:53.479> back<00:01:53.630> flip

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
you actually come to doing the back flip

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.210 
you actually come to doing the back flip
you're<00:01:54.410> not<00:01:54.500> going<00:01:54.649> to<00:01:54.710> be<00:01:54.800> scared<00:01:55.070> because

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
you're not going to be scared because

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.190 
you're not going to be scared because
you<00:01:55.520> knowing<00:01:56.030> that<00:01:56.240> you've<00:01:56.360> done<00:01:56.539> it<00:01:56.720> just

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
you knowing that you've done it just

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
you knowing that you've done it just
without<00:01:57.470> doing<00:01:57.710> the<00:01:57.800> job

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
without doing the job

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:05.109 
without doing the job

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
so I'll show you an example that's so

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:10.809 
so I'll show you an example that's so
much<00:02:05.300> follow

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:26.910 

ah<00:02:11.110> great<00:02:12.140> one<00:02:13.069> guy

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.540 

ah<00:02:27.960> I<00:02:28.960> think<00:02:29.710> it<00:02:29.920> was<00:02:30.010> you<00:02:30.069> back<00:02:30.220> like<00:02:30.400> this

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
ah I think it was you back like this

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.960 
ah I think it was you back like this
slide<00:02:30.910> but<00:02:31.660> um<00:02:32.280> yeah<00:02:33.280> I'll<00:02:33.430> try<00:02:33.610> that<00:02:33.760> on<00:02:33.790> the

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
slide but um yeah I'll try that on the

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.309 
slide but um yeah I'll try that on the
grass<00:02:34.180> before<00:02:34.510> you<00:02:34.690> do<00:02:34.810> it<00:02:34.870> on<00:02:34.990> concrete

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
grass before you do it on concrete

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.610 
grass before you do it on concrete
because<00:02:35.860> you<00:02:36.550> do<00:02:36.670> stack<00:02:37.030> it<00:02:37.180> sometimes<00:02:37.600> but<00:02:38.020> in
