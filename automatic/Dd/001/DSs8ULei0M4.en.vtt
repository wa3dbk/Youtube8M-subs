00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
flooding actually some of these I had to

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.520 
flooding actually some of these I had to
try<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.790> sit<00:01:36.360> through<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:36.900> kind<00:01:37.049> of<00:01:37.170> look<00:01:37.380> at

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
try to sit through and kind of look at

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.780

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
it actually wasn't a tsunami footage but

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.590 
it actually wasn't a tsunami footage but
this<00:01:43.259> is<00:01:43.409> more<00:01:43.619> or<00:01:43.710> less<00:01:43.770> from<00:01:44.210> Talos<00:01:45.210> and

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
this is more or less from Talos and

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.740 
this is more or less from Talos and
that's<00:01:46.140> really<00:01:47.100> surprising<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.970> this<00:01:48.149> chart

525 the morning of the second here when

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:24.890 
525 the morning of the second here when
the<00:02:23.940> storm<00:02:24.180> was<00:02:24.270> starting<00:02:24.540> to<00:02:24.630> make<00:02:24.720> landfall

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
the storm was starting to make landfall

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.080 
the storm was starting to make landfall
and<00:02:25.380> all<00:02:26.010> these<00:02:26.160> mountains<00:02:26.580> right<00:02:26.730> in<00:02:26.850> here

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
and all these mountains right in here

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.240 
and all these mountains right in here
really<00:02:27.360> enhance<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.260> orographic<00:02:28.590> lifting

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
really enhance the orographic lifting

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.860 
really enhance the orographic lifting
when<00:02:29.400> this<00:02:29.490> came<00:02:29.730> on<00:02:29.880> shore<00:02:30.120> so<00:02:30.360> basically

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
when this came on shore so basically

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.600 
when this came on shore so basically
those<00:02:30.989> clouds<00:02:31.260> had<00:02:31.470> a<00:02:31.500> run<00:02:31.739> uphill<00:02:31.890> they

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
those clouds had a run uphill they

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.270 
those clouds had a run uphill they
condense<00:02:33.390> and<00:02:33.630> water<00:02:34.500> just<00:02:34.800> fell<00:02:35.010> right<00:02:35.040> out

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
condense and water just fell right out

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.280 
condense and water just fell right out
of<00:02:35.430> them<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:35.760> dumped<00:02:36.209> in<00:02:36.300> a<00:02:36.390> massive<00:02:36.750> amount

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
of them and dumped in a massive amount

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.229 
of them and dumped in a massive amount
of<00:02:37.380> water<00:02:37.680> here<00:02:37.980> just<00:02:38.250> east<00:02:38.489> of<00:02:38.700> Osaka<00:02:39.090> and

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
of water here just east of Osaka and

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.809 
of water here just east of Osaka and
Kyoto<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.930> also<00:02:40.650> out<00:02:40.770> here<00:02:40.950> on<00:02:41.069> Shikoku<00:02:41.580> you

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
Kyoto and also out here on Shikoku you

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.970 
Kyoto and also out here on Shikoku you
see<00:02:42.090> those<00:02:42.300> higher<00:02:42.720> cloud<00:02:43.050> tops<00:02:43.260> here<00:02:43.530> as<00:02:43.800> well

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
see those higher cloud tops here as well

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.040 
see those higher cloud tops here as well
and<00:02:44.280> that<00:02:44.819> is<00:02:44.970> all<00:02:45.150> due<00:02:45.330> to<00:02:45.360> those<00:02:45.540> mountains

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
and that is all due to those mountains

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.290 
and that is all due to those mountains
and<00:02:46.290> also<00:02:46.590> that<00:02:46.769> on<00:02:46.950> flow<00:02:47.280> of<00:02:47.489> warm<00:02:47.820> moist<00:02:48.090> air

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
and also that on flow of warm moist air

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.000 
and also that on flow of warm moist air
colliding<00:02:48.810> with<00:02:49.019> this<00:02:49.230> area<00:02:49.620> and<00:02:49.800> just

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
colliding with this area and just

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.610 
colliding with this area and just
dropping<00:02:50.310> those<00:02:50.910> very<00:02:51.630> high<00:02:51.900> numbers<00:02:52.290> of<00:02:52.320> rain

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
dropping those very high numbers of rain

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.740 
dropping those very high numbers of rain
and<00:02:52.830> that<00:02:53.340> is<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.790> reason<00:02:53.820> why<00:02:54.269> we're

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
and that is the reason why we're

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.420 
and that is the reason why we're
continuing<00:02:55.380> to<00:02:55.410> see<00:02:55.709> these<00:02:55.890> flooding<00:02:56.310> and

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
continuing to see these flooding and

damage pictures coming out of here and

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.470 
damage pictures coming out of here and
actually<00:02:58.080> upwards<00:02:58.709> of<00:02:58.950> 35<00:02:59.670> despi<00:03:00.360> and

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
actually upwards of 35 despi and

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.270 
actually upwards of 35 despi and
reporter<00:03:00.870> right<00:03:00.989> now<00:03:01.140> and<00:03:01.350> still<00:03:01.590> over<00:03:01.950> 50

people<00:03:02.580> missing<00:03:02.970> so<00:03:03.180> terrible<00:03:04.080> news<00:03:04.290> coming

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.170 
people missing so terrible news coming
out<00:03:04.739> of<00:03:04.800> southern<00:03:05.190> Japan<00:03:05.550> still<00:03:05.910> and

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
out of southern Japan still and

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.240 
out of southern Japan still and
hopefully<00:03:06.720> this<00:03:06.930> news<00:03:07.110> does<00:03:07.380> get<00:03:07.590> better<00:03:07.739> but

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
hopefully this news does get better but

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.770 
hopefully this news does get better but
as<00:03:08.400> of<00:03:08.580> right<00:03:08.640> now<00:03:08.819> we're<00:03:09.239> continuing<00:03:09.600> to<00:03:09.630> see

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
as of right now we're continuing to see

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.570 
as of right now we're continuing to see
reports<00:03:10.170> of<00:03:10.260> mudslides<00:03:10.650> landslides<00:03:11.280> and<00:03:11.489> the

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
reports of mudslides landslides and the

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.490 
reports of mudslides landslides and the
ground<00:03:11.819> is<00:03:11.940> still<00:03:12.150> unstable<00:03:12.600> on<00:03:13.019> top<00:03:13.230> of<00:03:13.410> that

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
ground is still unstable on top of that

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.500 
ground is still unstable on top of that
so<00:03:13.769> hopefully<00:03:14.519> no<00:03:14.670> other<00:03:14.700> weather<00:03:15.090> systems

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
so hopefully no other weather systems

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.030 
so hopefully no other weather systems
come<00:03:15.690> through<00:03:15.959> the<00:03:16.080> area<00:03:16.410> at<00:03:16.470> any<00:03:16.620> time<00:03:16.860> in<00:03:16.980> the

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
come through the area at any time in the

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.979 
come through the area at any time in the
future<00:03:17.069> the<00:03:17.640> near<00:03:17.820> future<00:03:18.030> at<00:03:18.360> least<00:03:18.390> and<00:03:18.810> as

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
future the near future at least and as

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.750 
future the near future at least and as
of<00:03:19.200> right<00:03:19.380> now<00:03:19.410> actually<00:03:19.799> that<00:03:20.310> does<00:03:20.579> look

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
of right now actually that does look

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.430 
of right now actually that does look
like<00:03:20.820> the<00:03:21.120> case<00:03:21.299> high<00:03:21.540> pressure<00:03:21.840> has<00:03:22.140> ridged

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
like the case high pressure has ridged

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.190 
like the case high pressure has ridged
them<00:03:22.650> behind<00:03:22.920> thalassa<00:03:23.519> and<00:03:23.970> also<00:03:24.480> Nauru<00:03:24.959> and

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
them behind thalassa and also Nauru and

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.930 
them behind thalassa and also Nauru and
is<00:03:25.590> going<00:03:25.739> to<00:03:25.799> bring<00:03:25.980> much<00:03:26.190> more<00:03:26.430> fair<00:03:26.640> weather

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
is going to bring much more fair weather

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.759 
is going to bring much more fair weather
throughout<00:03:27.269> the<00:03:27.510> Korean<00:03:27.840> Peninsula<00:03:27.959> and<00:03:28.380> over

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
throughout the Korean Peninsula and over

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.500 
throughout the Korean Peninsula and over
into<00:03:29.040> Japan<00:03:29.400> as<00:03:29.579> these<00:03:29.790> two<00:03:30.000> areas<00:03:30.180> of<00:03:30.420> high

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
into Japan as these two areas of high

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.270 
into Japan as these two areas of high
pressure<00:03:30.750> ridge<00:03:31.140> in<00:03:31.380> towards<00:03:31.769> the<00:03:31.890> southeast

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
pressure ridge in towards the southeast

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.130 
pressure ridge in towards the southeast
as<00:03:32.549> these<00:03:32.730> move<00:03:32.940> off<00:03:33.150> towards<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:33.690> Northeast

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
as these move off towards the Northeast

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.050 
as these move off towards the Northeast
so<00:03:34.410> really<00:03:35.040> good<00:03:35.220> news<00:03:35.430> there<00:03:35.700> and<00:03:35.850> it<00:03:35.910> does

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
so really good news there and it does

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.370 
so really good news there and it does
look<00:03:36.209> like<00:03:36.239> these<00:03:36.570> Barrett<00:03:36.900> Clinton<00:03:37.140> kites

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
look like these Barrett Clinton kites

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
look like these Barrett Clinton kites
are<00:03:37.470> going<00:03:37.590> to<00:03:37.650> dominate<00:03:38.130> the<00:03:38.280> weather

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
are going to dominate the weather

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.340 
are going to dominate the weather
pattern<00:03:38.700> over<00:03:39.450> the<00:03:39.480> next<00:03:39.810> several<00:03:39.959> days<00:03:40.140> and

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
pattern over the next several days and

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:41.810 
pattern over the next several days and
actually<00:03:40.680> out<00:03:40.799> to<00:03:40.980> a<00:03:41.010> week<00:03:41.250> it<00:03:41.459> does<00:03:41.610> look<00:03:41.760> like

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
actually out to a week it does look like

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.490 
actually out to a week it does look like
these<00:03:42.000> are<00:03:42.120> going<00:03:42.239> to<00:03:42.299> dominate<00:03:42.510> so<00:03:42.930> bring<00:03:43.410> it

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
these are going to dominate so bring it

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.810 
these are going to dominate so bring it
a<00:03:43.560> little<00:03:43.590> bit<00:03:43.829> better<00:03:43.950> weather<00:03:44.280> so<00:03:44.640> the

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
a little bit better weather so the

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.759 
a little bit better weather so the
recovery<00:03:45.269> efforts<00:03:45.600> can<00:03:45.840> continue<00:03:46.350> down<00:03:46.530> here

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
recovery efforts can continue down here

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.470 
recovery efforts can continue down here
in<00:03:46.859> southern<00:03:47.100> Japan<00:03:47.430> as<00:03:47.609> of<00:03:48.269> right<00:03:48.450> now

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
in southern Japan as of right now

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:49.910 
in southern Japan as of right now
doesn't<00:03:48.900> look<00:03:49.109> like<00:03:49.260> any<00:03:49.380> tropical<00:03:49.650> activity

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
doesn't look like any tropical activity

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.560 
doesn't look like any tropical activity
heading<00:03:50.489> up<00:03:50.609> here<00:03:50.640> towards<00:03:51.060> the<00:03:51.150> north<00:03:51.390> but

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:51.570 
heading up here towards the north but

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:52.849 
heading up here towards the north but
that<00:03:51.720> doesn't<00:03:52.049> discount<00:03:52.380> any<00:03:52.590> tropical

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
that doesn't discount any tropical

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:54.680 
that doesn't discount any tropical
activity<00:03:53.130> throughout<00:03:53.700> the<00:03:53.910> western<00:03:54.239> Pacific

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
activity throughout the western Pacific

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:55.970 
activity throughout the western Pacific
and<00:03:54.840> I<00:03:54.870> say<00:03:55.079> that<00:03:55.109> because<00:03:55.410> if<00:03:55.680> we<00:03:55.769> look<00:03:55.920> at

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
and I say that because if we look at

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.229 
and I say that because if we look at
some<00:03:56.160> of<00:03:56.250> the<00:03:56.310> model<00:03:56.609> runs<00:03:56.790> this<00:03:57.000> one

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
some of the model runs this one

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.270 
some of the model runs this one
specifically<00:03:57.840> no<00:03:58.230> gaps<00:03:58.500> this<00:03:58.739> is<00:03:58.859> out<00:03:58.980> on<00:03:59.010> the

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
specifically no gaps this is out on the

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.400 
specifically no gaps this is out on the
8th<00:03:59.519> you<00:03:59.850> start<00:04:00.150> to<00:04:00.239> see<00:04:00.420> these<00:04:00.630> on<00:04:00.810> activity

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
8th you start to see these on activity

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.319 
8th you start to see these on activity
right<00:04:01.620> around<00:04:01.829> the<00:04:01.980> monsoon<00:04:02.370> trough<00:04:02.670> in<00:04:03.030> near

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
right around the monsoon trough in near

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.390 
right around the monsoon trough in near
and<00:04:03.540> around<00:04:03.630> the<00:04:03.900> Philippines<00:04:04.350> to<00:04:04.859> build<00:04:05.130> up

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
and around the Philippines to build up

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.830 
and around the Philippines to build up
and<00:04:05.700> this<00:04:05.940> is<00:04:06.090> just<00:04:06.209> showing<00:04:06.450> here<00:04:06.690> in<00:04:06.780> the

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
and this is just showing here in the

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.940 
and this is just showing here in the
Philippines<00:04:07.230> so<00:04:07.320> you<00:04:07.410> got<00:04:07.530> area<00:04:07.799> of<00:04:07.859> low

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
Philippines so you got area of low

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.680 
Philippines so you got area of low
pressure<00:04:07.980> there<00:04:08.459> up<00:04:08.640> here<00:04:09.150> by<00:04:09.269> honey<00:04:09.480> and<00:04:09.630> you

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
pressure there up here by honey and you

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:10.880 
pressure there up here by honey and you
also<00:04:09.810> got<00:04:10.049> a<00:04:10.079> low<00:04:10.230> pressure<00:04:10.470> and<00:04:10.560> also

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
also got a low pressure and also

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.949 
also got a low pressure and also
northwest<00:04:11.549> on<00:04:11.700> the<00:04:11.790> Marianas<00:04:12.359> another<00:04:12.750> one

00:04:12.949 --> 00:04:12.959 
northwest on the Marianas another one

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:15.020 
northwest on the Marianas another one
developing<00:04:13.440> and<00:04:13.590> this<00:04:14.160> is<00:04:14.340> a<00:04:14.370> really<00:04:14.850> long

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
developing and this is a really long

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.640 
developing and this is a really long
range<00:04:15.269> out<00:04:15.480> and<00:04:15.690> likely<00:04:16.049> not<00:04:16.289> going<00:04:16.320> to<00:04:16.500> see

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
range out and likely not going to see

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.110 
range out and likely not going to see
three<00:04:16.950> areas<00:04:17.280> of<00:04:17.400> little<00:04:17.549> pressures<00:04:17.850> at<00:04:18.030> the

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
three areas of little pressures at the

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.029 
three areas of little pressures at the
same<00:04:18.269> time<00:04:18.479> but<00:04:18.720> it<00:04:18.840> just<00:04:19.079> is<00:04:19.229> indicating<00:04:19.950> an

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
same time but it just is indicating an

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:21.380 
same time but it just is indicating an
increase<00:04:20.519> in<00:04:20.549> the<00:04:20.820> tropical<00:04:21.269> activity

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
increase in the tropical activity

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.570 
increase in the tropical activity
actually<00:04:22.289> compare<00:04:22.950> this<00:04:23.099> with<00:04:23.280> the<00:04:23.340> other

there<00:04:37.210> and<00:04:37.300> also<00:04:37.690> you<00:04:37.750> have<00:04:37.900> this<00:04:38.050> area<00:04:38.259> of<00:04:38.380> low

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
there and also you have this area of low

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.170 
there and also you have this area of low
pressure<00:04:38.500> spinning<00:04:39.009> up<00:04:39.310> just<00:04:39.789> north<00:04:40.060> and

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.240 
currents but outside of that it's really

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:11.020 
in the upper levels only a slight bit of

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:12.729 
convection on the southern periphery and

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:14.310 
convection on the southern periphery and
this<00:06:13.150> is<00:06:13.330> going<00:06:13.509> to<00:06:13.570> drift<00:06:13.750> off<00:06:13.930> towards<00:06:14.289> the

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:14.320 
this is going to drift off towards the

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.620 
this is going to drift off towards the
north<00:06:14.590> towards<00:06:15.130> the<00:06:15.190> basically<00:06:15.820> unpopulated

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:16.630 
north towards the basically unpopulated

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:18.510 
north towards the basically unpopulated
islands<00:06:17.229> of<00:06:17.349> the<00:06:17.380> Creole<00:06:17.770> islands<00:06:18.130> up<00:06:18.220> here<00:06:18.430> in

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:18.520 
islands of the Creole islands up here in

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.070 
islands of the Creole islands up here in
the<00:06:18.610> very<00:06:18.729> low<00:06:18.970> populated<00:06:19.479> areas<00:06:19.750> of<00:06:19.870> camp

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.080 
the very low populated areas of camp

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.689 
the very low populated areas of camp
chaka<00:06:20.320> farther<00:06:20.710> up<00:06:20.860> towards<00:06:21.130> the<00:06:21.190> norm<00:06:21.460> so

00:06:21.689 --> 00:06:21.699 
chaka farther up towards the norm so

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:23.339 
chaka farther up towards the norm so
that's<00:06:22.330> really<00:06:22.630> all<00:06:22.900> that's<00:06:23.020> going<00:06:23.229> to<00:06:23.289> be

00:06:23.339 --> 00:06:23.349 
that's really all that's going to be

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:24.540 
that's really all that's going to be
coming<00:06:23.500> out<00:06:23.680> of<00:06:23.710> this<00:06:23.889> system<00:06:24.280> if<00:06:24.460> you

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:24.550 
coming out of this system if you

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.460 
coming out of this system if you
actually<00:06:24.669> look<00:06:24.909> at<00:06:25.120> the<00:06:25.150> track<00:06:25.389> from<00:06:25.599> JTWC<00:06:26.289> you

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:26.470 
actually look at the track from JTWC you

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:27.960 
actually look at the track from JTWC you
can<00:06:26.590> see<00:06:26.740> it<00:06:26.830> indicates<00:06:27.250> this<00:06:27.400> system<00:06:27.789> going

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:27.970 
can see it indicates this system going

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:29.550 
can see it indicates this system going
basically<00:06:28.419> straight<00:06:28.930> north<00:06:29.169> towards<00:06:29.500> the

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:29.560 
basically straight north towards the

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.800 
basically straight north towards the
coral<00:06:29.919> islands<00:06:30.340> maxing<00:06:30.849> out<00:06:30.909> intensity<00:06:31.539> revs

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:31.810 
coral islands maxing out intensity revs

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.700 
coral islands maxing out intensity revs
right<00:06:32.199> now<00:06:32.409> is<00:06:32.710> 35<00:06:33.220> gusting<00:06:33.639> to<00:06:33.669> 45<00:06:33.940> knots<00:06:34.419> and

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:34.710 
right now is 35 gusting to 45 knots and

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:37.409 
right now is 35 gusting to 45 knots and
JTWC<00:06:35.710> expects<00:06:36.159> a<00:06:36.279> gradual<00:06:36.729> decrease<00:06:37.150> in

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:37.419 
JTWC expects a gradual decrease in

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:39.570 
JTWC expects a gradual decrease in
intensity<00:06:37.539> so<00:06:38.110> by<00:06:38.830> later<00:06:39.070> today<00:06:39.279> is<00:06:39.400> actually

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:39.580 
intensity so by later today is actually

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.310 
intensity so by later today is actually
be<00:06:39.849> more<00:06:40.060> or<00:06:40.150> less<00:06:40.300> a<00:06:40.330> tropical<00:06:40.779> depression

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:41.320 
be more or less a tropical depression

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.080 
be more or less a tropical depression
but<00:06:41.800> I<00:06:42.070> really<00:06:42.460> think<00:06:42.490> this<00:06:42.940> is

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:43.090 
but I really think this is

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:45.390 
but I really think this is
extra-tropical<00:06:43.600> at<00:06:44.020> this<00:06:44.170> point<00:06:44.440> as<00:06:44.650> it<00:06:44.920> has<00:06:45.190> a

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:45.400 
extra-tropical at this point as it has a

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.460 
extra-tropical at this point as it has a
lot<00:06:45.700> of<00:06:45.730> cold<00:06:46.090> air<00:06:46.210> in<00:06:46.390> flow<00:06:46.600> into<00:06:46.930> it's<00:06:47.170> very

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:47.470 
lot of cold air in flow into it's very

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:49.920 
lot of cold air in flow into it's very
dry<00:06:47.890> and<00:06:48.160> it's<00:06:48.970> just<00:06:49.240> continuing<00:06:49.750> to<00:06:49.840> move

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:49.930 
dry and it's just continuing to move

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:52.050 
dry and it's just continuing to move
north<00:06:50.170> and<00:06:50.470> exceptionally<00:06:51.310> week<00:06:51.490> so<00:06:51.730> really

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:52.060 
north and exceptionally week so really

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:53.700 
north and exceptionally week so really
don't<00:06:52.240> expect<00:06:52.510> anything<00:06:52.810> more<00:06:52.990> out<00:06:53.230> of<00:06:53.440> this

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:53.710 
don't expect anything more out of this

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:55.440 
don't expect anything more out of this
but<00:06:54.130> here<00:06:54.310> just<00:06:54.550> showing<00:06:54.820> the<00:06:54.910> warnings<00:06:55.300> from

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:55.450 
but here just showing the warnings from

but here just showing the warnings from
JMA<00:06:55.990> there<00:06:56.260> is<00:06:56.380> still<00:06:56.680> these<00:06:56.860> high<00:06:57.070> wave

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:57.280 
JMA there is still these high wave

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.830 
JMA there is still these high wave
warnings<00:06:57.730> up<00:06:57.850> and<00:06:57.970> down<00:06:58.090> the<00:06:58.210> coast<00:06:58.450> but<00:06:58.570> also

00:06:58.830 --> 00:06:58.840 
warnings up and down the coast but also

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.270 
warnings up and down the coast but also
i<00:06:59.020> do<00:06:59.170> want<00:06:59.500> to<00:06:59.530> mention<00:06:59.710> some<00:07:00.130> of<00:07:00.160> the

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:00.280 
i do want to mention some of the

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:02.310 
i do want to mention some of the
remnants<00:07:00.760> of<00:07:00.850> Tala<00:07:01.180> says<00:07:01.570> it<00:07:01.780> is<00:07:01.900> moving<00:07:02.140> up

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:02.320 
remnants of Tala says it is moving up

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:03.990 
remnants of Tala says it is moving up
towards<00:07:02.590> Russia<00:07:02.860> continues<00:07:03.220> to<00:07:03.670> see<00:07:03.850> some

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:04.000 
towards Russia continues to see some

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.120 
towards Russia continues to see some
outflow<00:07:04.420> overall<00:07:04.780> keidel<00:07:05.170> here<00:07:05.350> so<00:07:05.560> these<00:07:05.980> are

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:06.130 
outflow overall keidel here so these are

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:07.590 
outflow overall keidel here so these are
also<00:07:06.280> coupled<00:07:06.880> with<00:07:07.030> some<00:07:07.270> heavy<00:07:07.510> rain

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:07.600 
also coupled with some heavy rain

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.630 
also coupled with some heavy rain

expecting<00:07:10.210> to<00:07:10.270> see<00:07:10.450> the<00:07:10.600> flooding<00:07:11.020> that<00:07:11.170> we

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:11.530 
expecting to see the flooding that we

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:12.930 
expecting to see the flooding that we
saw<00:07:11.710> down<00:07:11.950> south<00:07:12.220> but<00:07:12.430> there<00:07:12.550> still<00:07:12.640> could<00:07:12.880> be

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:12.940 
saw down south but there still could be

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:14.610 
saw down south but there still could be
some<00:07:13.030> off<00:07:13.420> flying<00:07:13.660> up<00:07:13.840> here<00:07:13.870> in<00:07:14.080> al-qaeda<00:07:14.410> and

some off flying up here in al-qaeda and

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.560 
some off flying up here in al-qaeda and
along<00:07:15.070> the<00:07:15.220> east<00:07:15.400> coast<00:07:15.520> specifically<00:07:16.420> this

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:16.570 
along the east coast specifically this

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:18.540 
along the east coast specifically this
one<00:07:16.810> raid<00:07:17.020> in<00:07:17.170> here<00:07:17.410> JMA<00:07:17.890> definitely<00:07:18.340> put<00:07:18.520> this

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:18.550 
one raid in here JMA definitely put this

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:20.460 
one raid in here JMA definitely put this
out<00:07:18.880> because<00:07:19.060> of<00:07:19.330> the<00:07:19.420> tsunami<00:07:19.840> hit<00:07:20.140> areas

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:20.470 
out because of the tsunami hit areas

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:22.110 
out because of the tsunami hit areas
once<00:07:21.280> you<00:07:21.400> start<00:07:21.610> getting<00:07:21.700> some<00:07:21.880> heavy

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:22.120 
once you start getting some heavy

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.090 
once you start getting some heavy
rainfall<00:07:22.630> over<00:07:22.990> these<00:07:23.140> regions<00:07:23.680> the<00:07:23.800> grounds

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:24.100 
rainfall over these regions the grounds

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:26.270 
rainfall over these regions the grounds
already<00:07:24.460> loose<00:07:24.730> and<00:07:25.000> it<00:07:25.180> could<00:07:25.420> become<00:07:25.810> very

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:26.280 
already loose and it could become very

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:29.070 
already loose and it could become very
disruptive<00:07:27.280> and<00:07:27.640> potential<00:07:28.360> of<00:07:28.540> mudslides

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:29.080 
disruptive and potential of mudslides

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:31.200 
disruptive and potential of mudslides
due<00:07:29.650> to<00:07:29.830> the<00:07:30.010> already<00:07:30.220> loose<00:07:30.700> grab<00:07:31.000> that

00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:31.210 
due to the already loose grab that

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:32.760 
due to the already loose grab that
region<00:07:31.630> but<00:07:31.810> that<00:07:31.990> is<00:07:32.110> all<00:07:32.290> for<00:07:32.470> rain<00:07:32.620> now

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:32.770 
region but that is all for rain now
