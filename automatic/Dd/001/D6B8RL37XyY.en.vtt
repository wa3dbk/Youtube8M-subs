00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.350 

well<00:01:11.920> fear<00:01:12.369> not<00:01:12.580> for<00:01:12.880> there<00:01:13.030> is<00:01:13.090> an<00:01:13.210> easy

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
well fear not for there is an easy

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.260 
well fear not for there is an easy
solution<00:01:13.600> for<00:01:14.200> a<00:01:14.740> broken<00:01:15.250> joystick<00:01:15.790> on<00:01:16.030> the

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
solution for a broken joystick on the

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.630 
solution for a broken joystick on the
controller<00:01:16.690> for<00:01:16.960> the<00:01:17.050> n64<00:01:17.490> since<00:01:18.490> they're

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
controller for the n64 since they're

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.760 
controller for the n64 since they're
made<00:01:18.820> of<00:01:18.970> plastic<00:01:19.450> parts<00:01:19.659> these<00:01:20.259> things<00:01:20.560> were

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
made of plastic parts these things were

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.310 
made of plastic parts these things were
down<00:01:20.979> very<00:01:21.550> easily<00:01:21.670> and<00:01:22.240> as<00:01:22.720> you<00:01:22.930> could<00:01:23.080> see<00:01:23.290> on

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
down very easily and as you could see on

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.310 
down very easily and as you could see on
the<00:01:23.409> TV<00:01:23.650> link<00:01:24.460> wasn't<00:01:24.940> going<00:01:25.240> very<00:01:25.270> far<00:01:25.720> so

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
the TV link wasn't going very far so

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.590 
the TV link wasn't going very far so
what's<00:01:26.920> the<00:01:27.100> solution<00:01:27.310> well<00:01:28.240> it's<00:01:28.450> very

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
what's the solution well it's very

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.320 
what's the solution well it's very
simple<00:01:28.960> these<00:01:29.560> joysticks<00:01:30.040> they're<00:01:30.640> pretty

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
simple these joysticks they're pretty

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.359 
simple these joysticks they're pretty
junky<00:01:31.600> as<00:01:32.530> you<00:01:32.680> can<00:01:32.830> see<00:01:32.950> I'm<00:01:33.070> barely<00:01:33.250> even

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
junky as you can see I'm barely even

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:34.859 
junky as you can see I'm barely even
touching<00:01:33.729> it<00:01:33.940> and<00:01:34.119> it<00:01:34.390> Wiggles<00:01:34.690> back<00:01:34.720> and

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
touching it and it Wiggles back and

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:37.499 
touching it and it Wiggles back and
forth<00:01:35.259> these<00:01:35.890> are<00:01:36.070> plastic<00:01:36.280> parts<00:01:36.789> they<00:01:37.240> wear

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
forth these are plastic parts they wear

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:41.790 
forth these are plastic parts they wear
down<00:01:37.780> so<00:01:38.380> the<00:01:39.009> fix<00:01:39.280> is<00:01:39.580> one<00:01:40.300> of<00:01:40.420> these<00:01:40.800> these

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
down so the fix is one of these these

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.790 
down so the fix is one of these these
are<00:01:42.310> a<00:01:42.940> new<00:01:43.300> joystick<00:01:43.780> replacement<00:01:44.320> from<00:01:44.710> a

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:44.800 
are a new joystick replacement from a

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.070 
are a new joystick replacement from a
company<00:01:45.160> called<00:01:45.190> videogame<00:01:46.060> Museum<00:01:46.479> they

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
company called videogame Museum they

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.320 
company called videogame Museum they
make<00:01:47.259> joysticks<00:01:47.800> like<00:01:48.009> this<00:01:48.190> for<00:01:48.490> your<00:01:48.580> n64

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
make joysticks like this for your n64

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.779 
make joysticks like this for your n64
using<00:01:49.810> the<00:01:49.929> exact<00:01:50.259> same<00:01:50.289> ports<00:01:50.979> using<00:01:51.759> a

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789 
using the exact same ports using a

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:53.700 
using the exact same ports using a
controller<00:01:52.210> that's<00:01:52.450> similar<00:01:52.840> in<00:01:53.110> style<00:01:53.350> to<00:01:53.560> a

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
controller that's similar in style to a

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.410 
controller that's similar in style to a
GameCube<00:01:54.250> controller<00:01:56.820> so<00:01:57.820> how<00:01:57.880> do<00:01:57.940> we<00:01:58.030> install

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
GameCube controller so how do we install

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.510 
GameCube controller so how do we install
one<00:01:58.600> of<00:01:58.630> these<00:01:58.810> well<00:01:59.649> it's<00:01:59.890> actually<00:02:00.039> very

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
one of these well it's actually very

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.330 
one of these well it's actually very
simple<00:02:01.500> first<00:02:02.500> thing<00:02:02.740> you<00:02:02.830> need<00:02:02.920> to<00:02:02.979> do<00:02:03.190> is

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
pull out here on 64 controller see we

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.460 
pull out here on 64 controller see we
have<00:02:07.119> one<00:02:07.330> that's<00:02:07.509> a<00:02:07.569> little<00:02:07.750> bit<00:02:07.989> floppy<00:02:08.170> this

you can pop it out like this and this is

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.290 
you can pop it out like this and this is
what<00:02:32.920> your<00:02:33.040> n64<00:02:33.580> controller<00:02:33.700> looks<00:02:34.090> like<00:02:34.209> on

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
is the one with the broken thing that I

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.970 
is the one with the broken thing that I
broke<00:02:52.900> earlier<00:02:53.790> what<00:02:54.790> are<00:02:54.879> you<00:02:54.970> doing<00:02:55.980> so

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
broke earlier what are you doing so

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.490 
broke earlier what are you doing so
after<00:02:57.069> you<00:02:57.280> do<00:02:57.340> that<00:02:57.550> what's<00:02:57.910> next<00:02:58.090> well<00:02:58.989> take

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
after you do that what's next well take

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:05.790

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
this thing pop it in here well before

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.589 
this thing pop it in here well before
you<00:03:05.890> do<00:03:06.010> that<00:03:06.220> perhaps<00:03:06.970> we<00:03:07.090> should<00:03:07.120> plug<00:03:07.390> it<00:03:07.510> in

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:07.599 
you do that perhaps we should plug it in

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:16.490 
you do that perhaps we should plug it in
first

beat I mean compared to the old joystick
you<00:04:05.379> can<00:04:05.560> see<00:04:05.739> already<00:04:05.920> the<00:04:06.340> difference<00:04:06.730> well

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:07.359 
you can see already the difference well

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:09.660 
you can see already the difference well
you<00:04:07.480> could<00:04:07.689> have<00:04:07.780> had<00:04:07.930> them<00:04:08.079> in<00:04:08.200> camera<00:04:08.670> the

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
you could have had them in camera the

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.460 
you could have had them in camera the
way<00:04:09.790> it<00:04:09.939> is<00:04:10.090> you<00:04:10.299> see<00:04:10.450> the<00:04:10.569> rounded<00:04:11.019> nature<00:04:11.349> of

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
way it is you see the rounded nature of

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.050 
way it is you see the rounded nature of
this<00:04:11.620> you<00:04:11.859> see<00:04:12.010> the<00:04:12.129> stick<00:04:12.430> that<00:04:12.609> pops<00:04:12.849> in

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
this you see the stick that pops in

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.580 
this you see the stick that pops in
there<00:04:13.269> and<00:04:13.449> moves<00:04:13.599> around<00:04:13.750> those<00:04:14.079> parts<00:04:14.410> down

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
there and moves around those parts down

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.089 
there and moves around those parts down
there<00:04:14.859> it's<00:04:15.720> even<00:04:16.720> at<00:04:16.870> perfect<00:04:17.349> it's<00:04:17.560> not<00:04:17.859> the

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:18.099 
there it's even at perfect it's not the

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:20.490 
there it's even at perfect it's not the
best<00:04:18.340> controller<00:04:18.880> I've<00:04:19.120> ever<00:04:19.269> used<00:04:19.690> in<00:04:19.989> terms

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
best controller I've ever used in terms

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.310 
best controller I've ever used in terms
of<00:04:20.709> joystick<00:04:21.130> power<00:04:21.310> this<00:04:22.000> this<00:04:22.630> totally

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
of joystick power this this totally

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.080 
of joystick power this this totally
feels<00:04:23.530> like<00:04:23.650> a<00:04:23.740> game<00:04:23.919> controller<00:04:24.520> except<00:04:24.970> for

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
feels like a game controller except for

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.000 
feels like a game controller except for
this<00:04:25.270> this<00:04:25.810> plastic<00:04:26.409> bit<00:04:26.560> feels<00:04:26.860> like

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
this this plastic bit feels like

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.159 
this this plastic bit feels like
denti-cal<00:04:27.460> in<00:04:27.789> nature<00:04:28.240> to<00:04:28.419> the<00:04:28.510> n64

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
denti-cal in nature to the n64

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:30.899 
denti-cal in nature to the n64
controller<00:04:29.289> same<00:04:29.830> kind<00:04:30.070> of<00:04:30.159> plastics<00:04:30.729> and

00:04:30.899 --> 00:04:30.909 
controller same kind of plastics and

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:33.689 
controller same kind of plastics and
everything<00:04:31.360> so<00:04:32.050> really<00:04:32.470> if<00:04:32.680> you<00:04:33.220> want<00:04:33.490> the

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:33.699 
everything so really if you want the

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:35.969 
everything so really if you want the
feel<00:04:34.030> of<00:04:34.180> an<00:04:34.270> n64<00:04:34.720> controller<00:04:35.020> this<00:04:35.710> is<00:04:35.860> the

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:35.979 
feel of an n64 controller this is the

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:37.950 
feel of an n64 controller this is the
way<00:04:36.070> to<00:04:36.130> go<00:04:36.400> because<00:04:36.729> it<00:04:36.940> feels<00:04:37.270> on<00:04:37.570> your<00:04:37.599> thumb

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
way to go because it feels on your thumb

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.230 
way to go because it feels on your thumb
exactly<00:04:38.590> like<00:04:38.680> an<00:04:38.800> n64<00:04:39.250> controller<00:04:39.580> except<00:04:40.150> it

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
exactly like an n64 controller except it

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.170 
exactly like an n64 controller except it
feels<00:04:40.449> so<00:04:41.169> much<00:04:41.620> smoother<00:04:42.220> and<00:04:42.370> a<00:04:42.970> lot<00:04:43.090> more

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
feels so much smoother and a lot more

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.600 
feels so much smoother and a lot more
precise<00:04:43.659> -<00:04:43.990> so<00:04:44.680> now<00:04:44.800> we<00:04:44.860> come<00:04:45.130> to<00:04:45.159> the<00:04:45.370> test

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
precise - so now we come to the test

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:46.920 
precise - so now we come to the test
portion<00:04:46.060> of<00:04:46.150> this<00:04:46.300> and<00:04:46.570> this<00:04:46.720> is<00:04:46.840> the

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
portion of this and this is the

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.149 
portion of this and this is the
controller<00:04:47.320> that<00:04:47.470> I<00:04:47.560> haven't<00:04:47.889> changed<00:04:48.039> the

00:04:48.149 --> 00:04:48.159 
controller that I haven't changed the

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:50.610 
controller that I haven't changed the
joystick<00:04:48.610> on<00:04:48.760> yet<00:04:49.120> the<00:04:50.020> reason<00:04:50.199> why<00:04:50.320> I<00:04:50.380> chose

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
joystick on yet the reason why I chose

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.420 
joystick on yet the reason why I chose
zelda<00:04:51.099> is<00:04:51.250> because<00:04:52.409> when<00:04:53.409> i<00:04:53.710> saw<00:04:54.039> the<00:04:54.099> original

particularly<00:05:02.500> because<00:05:02.919> of<00:05:03.520> the<00:05:04.150> way<00:05:04.240> the

a digital readout instead of an analogue
burrito<00:05:08.910> I<00:05:09.800> don't<00:05:10.800> think<00:05:11.100> this<00:05:11.250> is<00:05:11.400> legit

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:11.790 
burrito I don't think this is legit

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.760 
burrito I don't think this is legit
mainly<00:05:12.420> because<00:05:12.570> I<00:05:12.750> played<00:05:13.080> this<00:05:13.350> game<00:05:13.440> on<00:05:13.710> an

mainly because I played this game on an
emulator<00:05:13.920> before<00:05:14.460> and<00:05:15.230> using<00:05:16.230> a<00:05:16.410> Logitech
