00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.929
 hi to all and skyheroes how are you 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.030
 welcome to the days for a new 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.190
 Ballista gameplay on the Nape Mape 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.580
 ton m ute and peculiarities of the 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.560
 gameplay 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.690
 I will not play with ps3 controller 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.670
 usual I will play with the controller 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.020
 xbox that's because I have to 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.910
 still trains me with this manna 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.220
 is there then it's true that until 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.570
 now that I play on ps3 or on 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.250
 xbox 360 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.239
 I use my ps3 controller with a 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.500
 adapter and that's many times but 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.180
 sometimes it bug a little bit here for 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.500
 those who wonder I had the crown 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.440
 us for those who would be interested in 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.840
 play on a ps3 / xbox controller or 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.190
 of xbox on ps3 it is possible with the 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.840
 two the crowne had it really was a 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.309
 very good product but unfortunately 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.750
 they do not work anymore so even very 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.850
 good product that lets they work more 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.289
 young and in the ass so here I have a 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.940
 other I have x and m 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.920
 adapter that is not really very 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.690
 good because ring and sometimes there are 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.710
 bugs and finally no mistakes in 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.109
 game train like this and boom the 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.129
 character is going to take a turn on himself 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:03.300
 that I can say that when you're in 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.920
 full action and when there is a clip 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.170
 in front of you you really have serious 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.250
 balls but hey it's not the subject it's 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.900
 not the reason today 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.930
 I will play with the xbox controller 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.159
 so that's already I'm talking about is a 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.479
 little bit of difficulties I have because 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.840
 that I have difficulties with this 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.280
 controller 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.210
 sometimes we feel like that 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.920
 because I can make shots 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.070
 scop but I can tell you that sometimes 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.799
 I galley enormously because here is the 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.570
 xbox one will go out the ps4 will come out and 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.100
 today it's true that the question 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.540
 that everyone is asking all the people 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.369
 who are considering buying a console 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.110
 new generation is asking the question 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.920
 for those who are not determined 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.329
 because he has who are really 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.250
 determined yeah I take the ex boss 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.049
 yeah I take the ps4 nor that his 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.640
 mother the other console that's when there is 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.649
 who are determined me just was not 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.509
 not until now I'm not 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.520
 still 100% but still it's 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.930
 profile rather well on a type of 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.270
 model and I think you had it 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.770
 guessed today for the reason for 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.340
 which I play with the xbox controller 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.020
 it's because my choice is looking at 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.070
 the xbox one and I will explain 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.700
 why because it's true that 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.759
 until now 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.250
 i was leaning over ps4 i 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.039
 always been those at sony a ps1 ps2 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.330
 ps3 I'm really happy I never 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.830
 had problem would be who always has a 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.240
 little rivalry between xbox and 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.280
 playstation that's it for people like 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.480
 tugged a little bit by saying web the 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.890
 console is shit mine 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.160
 it's the best we can fight 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.140
 balls 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.820
 everyone likes what he wants he plays on this 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.750
 he wants if he is happy so much better 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.310
 he not go to piss others 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.270
 and I had no problem until 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.010
 now with any of the 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.240
 consoles so far I said I'm 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.010
 felt a little more comfortable on the 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.510
 console sony and especially with the 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.040
 joystick sony for me the joystick 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.410
 ps3 is a controller with which I have 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.580
 used to play since I'm not going 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.080
 say the night of time but since 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.890
 the playstation that exists and I can 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.880
 tell you it's been a while 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.800
 I think I think it's a bit 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.530
 over ten years and it was very 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.480
 difficult for me to change it's going to be 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.990
 very difficult I'm talking about it's going to be very 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.170
 difficult 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.090
 it's not done yet but and that's it 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.610
 why now my choice is 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:57.000
 more about the xbox one rather than the ps4 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.010
 many things firstly me 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.090
 plays exclusively not exclusively 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.280
 but at 90% 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.470
 I play call of duty and we know well 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.720
 unfortunately that microsoft and 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.570
 activision-blizzard so has the 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.700
 exclusives are on xbox and i'm going 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.960
 not have fun buying ps4 and xbox oil 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.630
 I could not anyway 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.910
 financially it costs too much and I 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.500
 go each time as well be finally 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.790
 switch from one console to another is 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.200
 that's not always very 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.370
 comfortable has always practiced that of 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.860
 anyway I could not so the 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.740
 question does not arise and because the 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.910
 dedicated servers will be on xbox one 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.720
 then there is a rumor a subscriber 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.730
 send me a message 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.110
 a rumor that says maybe there 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.980
 will have the dedicated servers also on 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.170
 playstation 4 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.850
 but so far nothing official 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.860
 should know that the dedicated server this 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.260
 is not the game that pays but the 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.180
 console so if we want to have the 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.100
 dedicated servers on playstation 4 c to 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.620
 sony to pay and not active vision 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.750
 microsoft bought the dedicated servers 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.780
 for call of duty kid so we'll have them 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.830
 dedicated servers on xbox one not on 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.530
 xbox 360 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.960
 only on xbox one and actually 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:03.300
 we know today that the problems 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.370
 connection on call of duty are from 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.320
 worse and worse because I also 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.820
 think there are more and more people who 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.680
 play so there are types of 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.780
 connections always times is everything 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.510
 anything dedicated servers 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.040
 really it's a solution i'm not saying 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.670
 that it is the perfect solution to all 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.260
 The problems 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.940
 it 's not going to mean we'll have the servers 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.860
 dedicated touvet all beautiful all pink we're going 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.150
 never complain about anything 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:24.490
 automatically any good caller 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.380
 of 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.639
 six fingers we always complain about 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.470
 something is always raging 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:31.000
 something and we will always find 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.550
 an excuse if it's not the connection 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.870
 to get upset because we get killed 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.650
 because we do not like to die and yes 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.169
 effectively 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.940
 that's it, but here are the 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:42.280
 dedicated servers will be a very good 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.630
 thing and so I do not want to go to 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.210
 aside that it can be understood 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.800
 also there will be the titan crowd game 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.300
 by the creators of call of duty 4 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.770
 for all who have tested it know 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.509
 that it still remains the reference one 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.130
 references in call of duty and for 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:56.979
 all who have tested crazy titans 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:05:00.069
 we say that really this game was great 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:02.110
 so this is an exclusivity also on 

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:04.240
 xbox so well here I have more the 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.949
 choice of shot between call of duty the 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.300
 excluded from call of our have to wait to 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:09.400
 every time a month later on 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.620
 playstation earlier kicks box the 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.639
 dedicated servers more crazy titan that makes 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.069
 a lot of things that finally my 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:18.099
 choice knowing that I play call of duty 

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:18.819
 the 90% will focus on the xbox one rather 

00:05:18.099 --> 00:05:22.030
 that the ps4 

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:24.400
 by the way the xbox one will be released in France 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.530
 and in mexico in the united states all that 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.900
 22 November but not in Belgium and 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:31.120
 Switzerland but by cons hitch asked 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.259
 a friend of mine if it was possible if we 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.419
 bought the console in France from power 

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:36.400
 use it in belgium or switzerland 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:38.110
 apparently he would have to check but 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.680
 apparently it would be possible so that 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.270
 would still be good news 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.590
 for you so that's the end of this 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:43.300
 gameplay hoping you liked it 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:44.620
