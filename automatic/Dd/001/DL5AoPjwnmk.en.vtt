00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
we've all seen Zelda before right I mean

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.390 
we've all seen Zelda before right I mean
this<00:00:35.659> isn't<00:00:35.900> the<00:00:36.110> first<00:00:36.379> and<00:00:36.680> what<00:00:37.159> is<00:00:37.280> this

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:37.400 
this isn't the first and what is this

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
and Zelda games I mean that's I think

and Zelda games I mean that's I think
that<00:00:41.809> that's<00:00:41.930> like<00:00:42.110> a<00:00:42.199> rough<00:00:42.470> estimate<00:00:42.949> but

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:43.159
