I'm<00:00:01.140> going<00:00:01.319> to<00:00:01.380> show<00:00:01.469> a<00:00:01.500> couple<00:00:01.740> of<00:00:01.949> things

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
I'm going to show a couple of things

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.070 
I'm going to show a couple of things
with<00:00:02.310> the<00:00:02.399> texturing<00:00:02.820> here<00:00:03.060> on<00:00:03.210> down<00:00:03.600> the<00:00:03.780> pc

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
with the texturing here on down the pc

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.869 
with the texturing here on down the pc
version<00:00:04.110> that<00:00:04.589> can<00:00:04.680> break<00:00:04.890> in<00:00:05.130> and<00:00:05.549> again<00:00:05.759> this

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
version that can break in and again this

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.460 
version that can break in and again this
is<00:00:06.029> all<00:00:06.150> this<00:00:06.420> is<00:00:06.600> actually<00:00:06.990> one<00:00:07.200> of<00:00:07.230> our

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
is all this is actually one of our

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.240 
is all this is actually one of our
environment<00:00:08.460> from<00:00:09.420> rage<00:00:09.719> so<00:00:10.500> it's<00:00:10.860> not<00:00:11.010> like<00:00:11.219> a

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
environment from rage so it's not like a

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.799 
environment from rage so it's not like a
typical<00:00:11.340> tech<00:00:11.910> demo<00:00:12.240> we<00:00:12.389> were<00:00:12.480> just<00:00:12.660> showing

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
typical tech demo we were just showing

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.589 
typical tech demo we were just showing
you<00:00:12.960> something<00:00:13.259> cool<00:00:13.559> I<00:00:13.860> can<00:00:14.309> actually<00:00:14.599> you

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
you something cool I can actually you

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.290 
you something cool I can actually you
know<00:00:15.719> get<00:00:15.929> in<00:00:16.080> here<00:00:16.580> should<00:00:17.580> switch<00:00:18.060> it<00:00:18.180> from

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
know get in here should switch it from

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.230 
know get in here should switch it from
the<00:00:18.449> AI<00:00:18.630> take<00:00:19.470> over<00:00:19.859> start<00:00:20.520> driving<00:00:20.730> knock

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
the AI take over start driving knock

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.830 
the AI take over start driving knock
that<00:00:21.449> down<00:00:21.600> around<00:00:22.490> and<00:00:23.490> at<00:00:24.150> any<00:00:24.300> time<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:24.600> can

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
that down around and at any time I can

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.750 
that down around and at any time I can
actually<00:00:25.880> switch<00:00:26.880> back<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.210> let<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.689> AI<00:00:28.019> take

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:28.760 
actually switch back and let the AI take

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.849 
actually switch back and let the AI take
control<00:00:29.760> here<00:00:29.880> I<00:00:30.510> can<00:00:31.320> go<00:00:31.380> back<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.619> the

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
control here I can go back to the

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.370 
control here I can go back to the
looping<00:00:32.219> camera<00:00:32.640> but<00:00:32.790> it's<00:00:32.910> not<00:00:33.090> just<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:33.660> video

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
looping camera but it's not just a video

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.750 
looping camera but it's not just a video
or<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:35.070> demo<00:00:35.489> here<00:00:35.989> if<00:00:36.989> that's<00:00:37.110> switch<00:00:37.410> around

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
or a demo here if that's switch around

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:43.670 
or a demo here if that's switch around
to<00:00:38.760> couple<00:00:39.059> many<00:00:39.210> different<00:00:39.540> views<00:00:42.440> this<00:00:43.440> for

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
to couple many different views this for

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.979 
to couple many different views this for
instance<00:00:43.980> two<00:00:44.370> of<00:00:44.489> our<00:00:44.610> goals<00:00:44.910> when<00:00:45.600> you<00:00:45.899> know

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
instance two of our goals when you know

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.650 
instance two of our goals when you know
Tim<00:00:46.200> Willits<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.969> other<00:00:48.120> designers

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
Tim Willits and and the other designers

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.910 
Tim Willits and and the other designers
we're<00:00:48.809> talking<00:00:49.110> about<00:00:49.200> what<00:00:49.469> we<00:00:49.649> wanted<00:00:49.860> to

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
we're talking about what we wanted to

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.970 
we're talking about what we wanted to
accomplish<00:00:50.539> it's<00:00:51.539> always<00:00:51.840> done<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.680> indoor

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
accomplish it's always done the indoor

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.310 
accomplish it's always done the indoor
environments<00:00:53.489> really<00:00:53.789> well<00:00:54.000> we<00:00:54.539> like<00:00:54.750> doing

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
environments really well we like doing

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.170 
environments really well we like doing
that<00:00:55.559> level<00:00:55.949> of<00:00:56.010> detail<00:00:56.070> that<00:00:56.489> you've<00:00:56.820> seen<00:00:57.030> in

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
that level of detail that you've seen in

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.360 
that level of detail that you've seen in
our<00:00:57.270> games<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:58.020> it's<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.410> big<00:00:58.500> deal<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.770> us<00:00:59.010> and

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
our games and it's a big deal to us and

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.180 
our games and it's a big deal to us and
we're<00:01:00.030> going<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.180> maintain<00:01:00.359> that<00:01:01.100> but<00:01:02.100> the

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
we're going to maintain that but the

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.560 
we're going to maintain that but the
reason<00:01:02.340> we<00:01:02.550> chose<00:01:02.579> this<00:01:02.940> environment<00:01:03.480> it's

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
reason we chose this environment it's

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.509 
reason we chose this environment it's
kind<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.750> something<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.140> little<00:01:04.260> different<00:01:04.559> but

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
kind of something a little different but

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.310 
kind of something a little different but
we<00:01:05.760> still<00:01:06.000> managed<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.390> get<00:01:06.689> this<00:01:06.900> kind<00:01:07.170> of

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
we still managed to get this kind of

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.679 
we still managed to get this kind of
large-scale<00:01:08.220> detail<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.150> see<00:01:09.330> here<00:01:09.540> with

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
large-scale detail you see here with

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.250 
large-scale detail you see here with
giant<00:01:10.110> cliff<00:01:10.380> faces<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:11.130> boulders<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.260> you

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
giant cliff faces and boulders and you

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.840 
giant cliff faces and boulders and you
know<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.409> don't<00:01:13.590> see<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.770> lot<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:14.010> procedural

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
know you don't see a lot of procedural

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.520 
know you don't see a lot of procedural
stuff<00:01:15.150> although<00:01:15.479> we<00:01:15.600> could<00:01:15.780> lose<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.229> if<00:01:16.409> it

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
stuff although we could lose that if it

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.980 
stuff although we could lose that if it
made<00:01:16.710> sense<00:01:17.009> but<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:17.939> can<00:01:18.090> go<00:01:18.210> from<00:01:18.450> these

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
made sense but you can go from these

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.800 
made sense but you can go from these
giant<00:01:19.409> boulders<00:01:19.830> all<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.250> way<00:01:20.369> down<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.970> a

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
giant boulders all the way down to a

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.740 
giant boulders all the way down to a
pebble<00:01:22.170> level<00:01:22.439> basically<00:01:22.790> it's<00:01:23.790> really<00:01:24.150> it

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
pebble level basically it's really it

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.929 
pebble level basically it's really it
gives<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.049> art<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.320> artists<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:26.580> know<00:01:26.610> enough

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
gives the art of artists you know enough

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.100 
gives the art of artists you know enough
freedom<00:01:27.240> where<00:01:27.540> you<00:01:27.750> won't<00:01:27.900> be<00:01:28.020> embarrassed

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
freedom where you won't be embarrassed

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.020 
freedom where you won't be embarrassed
if<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.799> player<00:01:29.009> hops<00:01:29.430> out<00:01:29.610> of<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.880> vehicle

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
if the player hops out of the vehicle

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.390 
if the player hops out of the vehicle
and<00:01:30.420> wants<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.689> walk<00:01:30.930> around<00:01:31.159> because<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.220> lot

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
and wants to walk around because a lot

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.560 
and wants to walk around because a lot
of<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.549> things<00:01:32.790> we're<00:01:32.939> planning<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.390> rage

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
of the things we're planning and rage

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.569 
of the things we're planning and rage
actually<00:01:34.020> call<00:01:34.229> for<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:34.619> that<00:01:35.189> level<00:01:35.490> of

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
actually call for that that level of

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.240 
actually call for that that level of
detail<00:01:37.070> so<00:01:38.070> all<00:01:38.369> of<00:01:38.400> this<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:38.970> think

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
detail so all of this I think

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.730 
detail so all of this I think
both<00:01:39.430> and<00:01:39.940> i'll<00:01:40.450> show<00:01:40.480> you<00:01:40.720> in<00:01:40.810> the<00:01:40.990> tools<00:01:41.230> how

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
both and i'll show you in the tools how

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.440 
both and i'll show you in the tools how
we<00:01:41.800> kind<00:01:42.010> of<00:01:42.130> get<00:01:42.280> to<00:01:42.460> this<00:01:42.580> level<00:01:42.790> in<00:01:43.090> detail

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
we kind of get to this level in detail

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.390 
we kind of get to this level in detail
and<00:01:44.140> again<00:01:44.470> here<00:01:44.680> you<00:01:44.800> can<00:01:44.950> see<00:01:45.100> a<00:01:45.130> lot<00:01:45.370> of

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
and again here you can see a lot of

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.940 
and again here you can see a lot of
large-scale<00:01:45.880> d<00:01:46.210> detail<00:01:46.900> giant<00:01:47.530> boulders

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
large-scale d detail giant boulders

cool<00:03:08.230> post-processing<00:03:09.040> effects<00:03:09.519> that<00:03:09.790> that

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
cool post-processing effects that that

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.870 
cool post-processing effects that that
are<00:03:10.450> giving<00:03:10.720> us<00:03:10.840> a<00:03:11.019> i<00:03:11.500> think<00:03:12.280> a<00:03:12.519> leg<00:03:12.700> up

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
are giving us a i think a leg up

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.600 
are giving us a i think a leg up
visually

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.640 

again<00:03:17.420> all<00:03:17.570> the<00:03:17.690> vehicles<00:03:18.080> this<00:03:18.200> is<00:03:18.320> actually

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
again all the vehicles this is actually

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.160 
again all the vehicles this is actually
a<00:03:18.680> I<00:03:18.800> driving<00:03:19.340> around<00:03:19.610> this<00:03:19.850> track<00:03:20.120> they<00:03:21.110> do

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
a I driving around this track they do

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:27.460 
a I driving around this track they do
that<00:03:21.470> thing<00:03:21.650> pretty<00:03:21.890> well<00:03:26.020> okay<00:03:27.020> now<00:03:27.230> here<00:03:27.440> I

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
that thing pretty well okay now here I

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.440 
that thing pretty well okay now here I
am<00:03:27.560> and<00:03:27.920> again<00:03:28.310> I'm<00:03:28.400> popping<00:03:28.820> around<00:03:28.910> here<00:03:29.270> for

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
am and again I'm popping around here for

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:30.880 
am and again I'm popping around here for
the<00:03:29.540> sake<00:03:29.720> of<00:03:29.750> the<00:03:29.900> demo<00:03:30.200> but<00:03:30.620> the<00:03:30.680> player

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
the sake of the demo but the player

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.290 
the sake of the demo but the player
could<00:03:31.130> just<00:03:31.280> drive<00:03:31.460> a<00:03:31.520> car<00:03:31.880> and<00:03:32.090> get<00:03:32.270> out

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
could just drive a car and get out

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.780 
could just drive a car and get out
anywhere<00:03:32.900> and<00:03:33.200> explore<00:03:34.100> the<00:03:34.250> world<00:03:34.460> basically

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
anywhere and explore the world basically

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.790 
anywhere and explore the world basically
and<00:03:35.510> that's<00:03:35.870> the<00:03:36.080> i<00:03:36.320> think<00:03:36.380> that's<00:03:36.680> the

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
and that's the i think that's the

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.440 
and that's the i think that's the
biggest<00:03:37.010> thing<00:03:37.190> that's<00:03:37.520> driving<00:03:37.760> us<00:03:38.210> right

all the detail that we would normally

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.210 
all the detail that we would normally
have<00:04:05.840> with<00:04:05.989> our<00:04:06.050> characters<00:04:06.680> we're<00:04:07.130> not

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:07.220

totally<00:04:09.500> you<00:04:09.800> know<00:04:09.830> departing<00:04:10.820> from<00:04:10.940> what<00:04:11.180> we

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:11.360 
totally you know departing from what we

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.540 
totally you know departing from what we
normally<00:04:11.510> do<00:04:11.989> we're<00:04:12.380> just<00:04:12.530> adding<00:04:12.739> on<00:04:13.010> top<00:04:13.250> a

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550 
normally do we're just adding on top a

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.910 
normally do we're just adding on top a
lot<00:04:13.910> of<00:04:14.060> a<00:04:14.239> lot<00:04:14.480> of<00:04:14.540> different<00:04:14.660> you<00:04:15.590> know<00:04:15.680> cool

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
lot of a lot of different you know cool

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.670 
lot of a lot of different you know cool
elements<00:04:16.780> the<00:04:17.780> one<00:04:17.930> thing<00:04:18.140> this<00:04:18.290> game<00:04:18.500> will

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
elements the one thing this game will

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.790 
elements the one thing this game will
never<00:04:18.890> do<00:04:19.130> is<00:04:19.280> get<00:04:19.459> stale<00:04:19.760> I<00:04:20.090> guarantee<00:04:20.510> that

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.490 

so<00:04:24.800> again<00:04:25.040> like<00:04:25.190> I<00:04:25.280> was<00:04:25.370> mentioning<00:04:25.550> before

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
so again like I was mentioning before

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.780 
so again like I was mentioning before
it's<00:04:27.500> really<00:04:27.680> not<00:04:27.830> very<00:04:27.890> good<00:04:28.310> having<00:04:28.700> the

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
it's really not very good having the

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.140 
it's really not very good having the
ability<00:04:28.940> to<00:04:29.270> completely<00:04:30.669> uniquely<00:04:31.669> touch<00:04:31.910> or

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
ability to completely uniquely touch or

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.719 
ability to completely uniquely touch or
an<00:04:32.240> entire<00:04:32.540> world<00:04:32.900> and<00:04:33.290> again<00:04:33.800> this<00:04:33.919> at<00:04:34.490> this

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:34.729 
an entire world and again this at this

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:37.930 
an entire world and again this at this
track<00:04:35.000> actually<00:04:35.450> uses<00:04:35.810> a<00:04:35.840> 64<00:04:36.470> x<00:04:36.700> 64<00:04:37.700> k

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
track actually uses a 64 x 64 k

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.240 
track actually uses a 64 x 64 k
landscape<00:04:38.419> tensioner<00:04:38.840> but<00:04:39.530> some<00:04:39.979> of<00:04:40.070> our

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
landscape tensioner but some of our

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:43.840 
landscape tensioner but some of our
waste<00:04:40.700> lands<00:04:41.150> are<00:04:41.330> actually<00:04:41.950> 128<00:04:42.950> x<00:04:43.190> 28<00:04:43.640> so

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
waste lands are actually 128 x 28 so

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.719 
waste lands are actually 128 x 28 so
that's<00:04:44.030> like<00:04:44.360> for<00:04:44.720> these<00:04:45.250> you<00:04:46.250> know<00:04:46.340> combined

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:46.729 
that's like for these you know combined

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:49.690 
that's like for these you know combined
together<00:04:46.940> and<00:04:47.419> the<00:04:48.169> actual<00:04:48.470> physical

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:49.700 
together and the actual physical

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.280 
together and the actual physical
is<00:04:49.760> that<00:04:50.000> you<00:04:50.120> get<00:04:50.210> to<00:04:50.270> travel<00:04:50.840> with<00:04:50.990> all<00:04:51.110> the

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:51.290 
is that you get to travel with all the

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:53.530 
is that you get to travel with all the
roads<00:04:51.500> and<00:04:51.890> walking<00:04:52.580> up<00:04:52.700> tiny<00:04:52.940> little<00:04:53.270> paths

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 
roads and walking up tiny little paths

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.410 
roads and walking up tiny little paths
is<00:04:53.930> if<00:04:54.710> it's<00:04:55.280> actually<00:04:55.670> a<00:04:55.700> challenge<00:04:55.970> for<00:04:56.360> us

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:56.420 
is if it's actually a challenge for us

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.180 
is if it's actually a challenge for us
to<00:04:56.750> take<00:04:56.900> advantage<00:04:57.170> of<00:04:57.470> that<00:04:57.620> much<00:04:57.860> space

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
to take advantage of that much space

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:00.190 
to take advantage of that much space
that<00:04:58.550> have<00:04:58.670> the<00:04:58.820> gameplay<00:04:59.240> but<00:04:59.300> it's<00:04:59.720> it's

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
that have the gameplay but it's it's

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.470 
that have the gameplay but it's it's
turning<00:05:00.500> out<00:05:00.590> pretty<00:05:00.650> well<00:05:00.890> so<00:05:01.190> far<00:05:01.270> so<00:05:02.270> again

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.480 
turning out pretty well so far so again

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.630 
turning out pretty well so far so again
you<00:05:03.080> know<00:05:03.140> having<00:05:03.770> the<00:05:03.830> ability<00:05:03.980> to<00:05:04.310> do<00:05:04.430> it<00:05:04.550> is

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:04.640 
you know having the ability to do it is

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.210 
you know having the ability to do it is
one<00:05:04.850> thing<00:05:05.120> but<00:05:05.360> having<00:05:05.480> the<00:05:05.660> tools<00:05:05.870> to<00:05:06.050> take

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
one thing but having the tools to take

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.310 
one thing but having the tools to take
advantage<00:05:07.220> of<00:05:07.340> it<00:05:07.490> is<00:05:07.880> another<00:05:08.270> thing<00:05:08.510> so<00:05:08.870> I'm

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
advantage of it is another thing so I'm

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.810 
advantage of it is another thing so I'm
going<00:05:09.500> to<00:05:09.530> jump<00:05:09.680> over<00:05:09.950> to<00:05:09.980> the<00:05:10.190> tools<00:05:10.430> machine

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
going to jump over to the tools machine

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.760 
going to jump over to the tools machine
and<00:05:11.270> kind<00:05:11.480> of<00:05:11.540> show<00:05:11.750> you<00:05:11.810> how<00:05:12.140> we<00:05:12.200> get<00:05:12.500> to<00:05:12.650> that

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
and kind of show you how we get to that

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.220 
and kind of show you how we get to that
level<00:05:12.980> of<00:05:13.160> detail
