to<00:01:12.050> make<00:01:12.200> sharp<00:01:12.590> cuts<00:01:12.980> make<00:01:13.640> sure<00:01:13.790> you<00:01:13.940> use<00:01:14.150> a

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
to make sharp cuts make sure you use a

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.660 
to make sharp cuts make sure you use a
good<00:01:14.300> technique<00:01:14.930> upper<00:01:15.290> body<00:01:15.500> mechanics<00:01:15.740> to

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
good technique upper body mechanics to

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.700 
good technique upper body mechanics to
the<00:01:16.760> correct<00:01:17.150> plant<00:01:17.510> foot<00:01:17.810> every<00:01:18.350> time<00:01:18.560> to

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
the correct plant foot every time to

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.010 
the correct plant foot every time to
change<00:01:18.950> direction<00:01:19.370> at<00:01:19.670> each<00:01:19.910> cone<00:01:20.210> so<00:01:20.810> let<00:01:20.960> me

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
change direction at each cone so let me

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.210 
change direction at each cone so let me
show<00:01:21.170> you<00:01:21.290> the<00:01:21.380> four<00:01:21.680> different<00:01:22.040> letter

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
show you the four different letter

00:01:22.220 --> 00:02:58.300 
show you the four different letter
patterns

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.370 

okay<00:02:59.310> so<00:02:59.370> there<00:02:59.670> you<00:02:59.700> have<00:02:59.820> it<00:03:00.120> the<00:03:00.240> M<00:03:00.390> and<00:03:00.930> the

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
okay so there you have it the M and the

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.340 
okay so there you have it the M and the
next<00:03:01.770> and<00:03:02.130> the<00:03:02.370> C<00:03:02.610> pattern<00:03:02.910> these<00:03:03.540> :<00:03:03.930> agility

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
next and the C pattern these : agility

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.440 
next and the C pattern these : agility
exercises<00:03:04.590> are<00:03:05.040> really<00:03:05.400> great<00:03:05.700> and<00:03:06.120> they're
