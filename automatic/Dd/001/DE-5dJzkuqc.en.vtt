35<00:00:09.410> let's<00:00:10.410> start<00:00:10.740> by<00:00:10.920> assembling<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:11.700> rail

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
35 let's start by assembling the rail

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.629 
35 let's start by assembling the rail
clamp<00:00:12.330> system<00:00:12.690> to<00:00:13.380> the<00:00:13.500> rail<00:00:13.740> along<00:00:14.340> with<00:00:14.549> the

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
clamp system to the rail along with the

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.359 
clamp system to the rail along with the
davit<00:00:14.969> arm<00:00:15.500> we're<00:00:16.500> going<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:16.710> leave<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.010> bolts

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
davit arm we're going to leave the bolts

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.480 
davit arm we're going to leave the bolts
a<00:00:17.460> little<00:00:17.730> loose<00:00:17.880> so<00:00:18.270> you<00:00:18.300> can<00:00:18.449> move<00:00:18.720> it<00:00:18.869> around

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
a little loose so you can move it around

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.279 
a little loose so you can move it around
we<00:00:20.490> slip<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.850> lower<00:00:21.029> mount<00:00:21.330> into<00:00:21.720> place<00:00:21.960> and

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
we slip the lower mount into place and

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.710 
we slip the lower mount into place and
rotate<00:00:22.439> it<00:00:22.830> until<00:00:22.949> it<00:00:23.400> sets<00:00:23.640> flat<00:00:24.000> on<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.510> tool

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
rotate it until it sets flat on the tool

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.950 
rotate it until it sets flat on the tool
rail<00:00:25.189> once<00:00:26.189> we<00:00:26.340> find<00:00:26.640> our<00:00:26.880> upper<00:00:27.390> placement

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
rail once we find our upper placement

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.140 
rail once we find our upper placement
I'm<00:00:28.680> going<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.010> take<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.250> measurement<00:00:29.670> from<00:00:29.970> the

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
I'm going to take a measurement from the

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.350 
I'm going to take a measurement from the
stanchion<00:00:30.689> over<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.859> where<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.099> lower<00:00:32.880> davit

stanchion over to where the lower davit

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.260 
stanchion over to where the lower davit
mounts<00:00:33.780> now<00:00:34.559> I<00:00:34.620> can<00:00:34.980> go<00:00:35.130> underneath<00:00:35.579> the<00:00:36.090> toe

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
mounts now I can go underneath the toe

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.720 
mounts now I can go underneath the toe
rail<00:00:36.540> and<00:00:36.840> check<00:00:37.079> for<00:00:37.290> clearance<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:37.920> can

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
rail and check for clearance I can

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.400 
rail and check for clearance I can
measure<00:00:38.879> over<00:00:39.300> from<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.629> same<00:00:39.899> stanchion

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
measure over from the same stanchion

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.950 
measure over from the same stanchion
bolt<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:41.399> double<00:00:41.879> check<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.270> make<00:00:42.390> sure<00:00:42.450> see<00:00:42.899> if

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
bolt to double check to make sure see if

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.270 
bolt to double check to make sure see if
there's<00:00:43.140> anything<00:00:43.410> that's<00:00:43.710> going<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:43.980> get<00:00:44.129> in

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
there's anything that's going to get in

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.540 
there's anything that's going to get in
the<00:00:44.370> way<00:00:45.289> we<00:00:46.289> do<00:00:46.469> have<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.680> bolt<00:00:47.070> that<00:00:47.309> is

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
the way we do have a bolt that is

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.150 
the way we do have a bolt that is
probably<00:00:48.030> going<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.300> be<00:00:48.420> in<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.660> way<00:00:49.039> but<00:00:50.039> this

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
probably going to be in the way but this

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.590 
probably going to be in the way but this
is<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.370> placement<00:00:50.700> where<00:00:51.059> we<00:00:51.149> would<00:00:51.270> like<00:00:51.449> to

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
is the placement where we would like to

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.360 
is the placement where we would like to
be<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:52.199> we're<00:00:52.350> going<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.500> proceed<00:00:52.890> on<00:00:52.920> and

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
be so we're going to proceed on and

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.900 
be so we're going to proceed on and
drill<00:00:53.789> these<00:00:53.940> holes<00:00:54.000> as<00:00:54.469> we<00:00:55.469> found<00:00:55.680> out<00:00:55.980> these

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
drill these holes as we found out these

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.000 
drill these holes as we found out these
holes<00:00:57.210> were<00:00:57.449> real<00:00:57.690> close<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.260> bolt<00:00:58.500> so

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
holes were real close to the bolt so

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.549 
holes were real close to the bolt so
we're<00:00:59.250> unable<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.670> use<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.210> backing<00:01:00.600> plate<00:01:00.840> so

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
we're unable to use the backing plate so

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:02.959 
we're unable to use the backing plate so
in<00:01:01.680> this<00:01:01.800> case<00:01:02.070> it's<00:01:02.340> perfectly<00:01:02.760> acceptable

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
in this case it's perfectly acceptable

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.780 
in this case it's perfectly acceptable
to<00:01:03.510> use<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.080> washers

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.150 

here<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.450> set<00:01:09.870> the<00:01:09.990> location<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.950> lower

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:11.160 
here I set the location of the lower

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.260 
here I set the location of the lower
mount<00:01:11.490> I<00:01:12.830> am<00:01:13.830> able<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.250> reach<00:01:14.670> under<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.090> toe

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
mount I am able to reach under the toe

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.320 
mount I am able to reach under the toe
rail<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.840> we<00:01:16.530> are<00:01:16.710> clear<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:17.640> we<00:01:17.820> are<00:01:17.880> good<00:01:18.300> to

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
rail and we are clear so we are good to

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.870 
rail and we are clear so we are good to
go<00:01:20.450> here<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:21.660> do<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.930> final<00:01:22.350> double-check<00:01:23.190> to<00:01:23.640> set

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
go here I do a final double-check to set

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.480 
go here I do a final double-check to set
the<00:01:24.000> davon<00:01:24.330> arm<00:01:24.480> parallel<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.680> stanchion

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
when setting the lower mount placement

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.830 
when setting the lower mount placement
check<00:01:32.160> that<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.460> dabit<00:01:32.820> arm<00:01:33.060> has<00:01:33.330> clearance

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
check that the dabit arm has clearance

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.360 
check that the dabit arm has clearance
to<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.500> lower<00:01:34.710> rail<00:01:36.350> after<00:01:37.350> using<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.160> lower
