00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
right now we've got outdoor Motors

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.749 
right now we've got outdoor Motors
practice<00:01:16.110> motors<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.740> stuff<00:01:17.189> getting<00:01:17.520> bill

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
practice motors and stuff getting bill

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.789 
practice motors and stuff getting bill
how<00:01:18.180> many<00:01:18.390> motors<00:01:18.780> would<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.110> go<00:01:19.259> through<00:01:19.560> in

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
how many motors would you go through in

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.490 
how many motors would you go through in
a<00:01:19.890> year<00:01:19.920> I<00:01:20.490> think<00:01:20.850> we<00:01:21.210> have<00:01:21.390> about<00:01:21.509> 18<00:01:22.020> -<00:01:22.259> funny

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
a year I think we have about 18 - funny

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.249 
a year I think we have about 18 - funny
really<00:01:23.100> get<00:01:23.520> rotated<00:01:23.729> as<00:01:24.240> well<00:01:24.479> as<00:01:24.630> frames<00:01:24.930> and

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259

technology<00:01:56.079> that<00:01:56.469> we<00:01:56.590> have<00:01:56.799> right<00:01:57.159> here<00:01:57.189> is

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
technology that we have right here is

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.669 
technology that we have right here is
static<00:01:57.909> engine<00:01:58.329> dyno<00:01:58.509> so<00:01:59.170> what<00:01:59.319> that<00:01:59.439> means

00:01:59.669 --> 00:01:59.679 
static engine dyno so what that means

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:01.319 
static engine dyno so what that means
they<00:02:00.069> bolt<00:02:00.340> the<00:02:00.399> engine<00:02:00.490> to<00:02:00.970> that<00:02:01.119> little

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:01.329 
they bolt the engine to that little

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:03.389 
they bolt the engine to that little
pretend<00:02:01.840> chassis<00:02:02.319> right<00:02:02.530> there<00:02:02.770> it<00:02:03.159> hooks

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
they can do they sit behind that

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.520 
they can do they sit behind that
bulletproof<00:02:06.880> glass<00:02:07.060> and<00:02:07.539> run<00:02:07.960> the<00:02:08.050> computer

they<00:02:08.679> can<00:02:08.739> load<00:02:09.099> up<00:02:09.280> the<00:02:09.459> motor<00:02:09.700> they<00:02:09.940> can

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
they can load up the motor they can

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.360 
they can load up the motor they can
select<00:02:10.390> different<00:02:10.599> gears<00:02:11.140> and<00:02:11.560> they<00:02:12.040> can<00:02:12.190> load

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
select different gears and they can load

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:13.860 
select different gears and they can load
up<00:02:12.400> the<00:02:12.610> motor<00:02:12.819> it's<00:02:13.299> like<00:02:13.540> your<00:02:13.690> true

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
up the motor it's like your true

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.780 
up the motor it's like your true
measurement<00:02:14.230> like<00:02:14.500> of<00:02:14.650> going<00:02:14.980> up<00:02:15.099> a<00:02:15.220> hill<00:02:15.400> they

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
measurement like of going up a hill they

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.430 
measurement like of going up a hill they
can<00:02:15.940> even<00:02:16.180> test<00:02:16.390> how<00:02:16.630> much<00:02:16.840> will<00:02:16.989> it<00:02:17.019> take<00:02:17.110> to

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
can even test how much will it take to

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.440 
can even test how much will it take to
break<00:02:17.650> something<00:02:18.130> which<00:02:18.489> has<00:02:18.730> durability

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
break something which has durability

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.870 
break something which has durability
which<00:02:19.690> has<00:02:19.900> strength<00:02:20.260> and<00:02:20.470> we've<00:02:20.829> really<00:02:21.190> test

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
which has strength and we've really test

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.120 
which has strength and we've really test
the<00:02:22.030> motor<00:02:22.209> to<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.540> limits<00:02:22.870> so<00:02:23.319> then<00:02:23.530> when

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
the motor to the limits so then when

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.770 
the motor to the limits so then when
they<00:02:24.310> do<00:02:24.370> build<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.760> bikes<00:02:25.030> they<00:02:25.540> can<00:02:25.690> be

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
they do build the bikes they can be

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.780 
they do build the bikes they can be
confident<00:02:26.319> that<00:02:26.410> it's<00:02:26.769> gonna<00:02:27.010> be<00:02:27.160> fine<00:02:27.400> on<00:02:27.430> on

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
confident that it's gonna be fine on on

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.910 
confident that it's gonna be fine on on
race<00:02:28.030> day<00:02:28.269> and<00:02:28.599> these<00:02:29.079> are<00:02:29.290> the<00:02:29.410> things<00:02:29.709> that

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
race day and these are the things that

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.430 
race day and these are the things that
people<00:02:30.250> don't<00:02:30.730> see<00:02:30.940> behind<00:02:31.720> the<00:02:31.930> scenes<00:02:32.200> like

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
people don't see behind the scenes like

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.949 
people don't see behind the scenes like
these<00:02:32.739> little<00:02:32.980> things<00:02:33.340> like<00:02:33.549> this<00:02:33.849> I<00:02:34.180> really

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:08.109 
give to us so you got the trick triple

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:09.750 
give to us so you got the trick triple
clamps<00:03:08.440> going<00:03:08.709> on<00:03:08.859> there<00:03:09.069> too<00:03:09.280> right<00:03:09.489> we<00:03:09.670> have

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
clamps going on there too right we have

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.460 
clamps going on there too right we have
a<00:03:09.910> new<00:03:10.150> brain<00:03:10.420> that's<00:03:10.660> working<00:03:11.019> quite<00:03:11.230> well

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
a new brain that's working quite well

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:12.870 
a new brain that's working quite well
yeah<00:03:11.680> no<00:03:11.829> these<00:03:11.980> are<00:03:12.130> great<00:03:12.310> you<00:03:12.519> know<00:03:12.670> over

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
yeah no these are great you know over

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.970 
yeah no these are great you know over
the<00:03:13.060> size<00:03:13.239> of<00:03:13.389> year<00:03:13.540> we<00:03:13.690> I<00:03:13.720> hadn't<00:03:14.200> even<00:03:14.290> I

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
the size of year we I hadn't even I

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.800 
the size of year we I hadn't even I
haven't<00:03:15.130> saw<00:03:15.370> them<00:03:15.549> before<00:03:15.639> but<00:03:16.389> these<00:03:16.510> clamps

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
haven't saw them before but these clamps

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.289 
haven't saw them before but these clamps
they've<00:03:17.079> got<00:03:17.230> dual<00:03:17.799> offset<00:03:18.730> so<00:03:18.940> you<00:03:19.030> can<00:03:19.150> turn

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
they've got dual offset so you can turn

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.420 
they've got dual offset so you can turn
around<00:03:19.359> the<00:03:19.660> stem<00:03:19.959> then<00:03:20.470> it<00:03:20.590> goes<00:03:20.739> from<00:03:20.920> 22<00:03:21.280> to

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
around the stem then it goes from 22 to

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.270 
around the stem then it goes from 22 to
24<00:03:22.000> so<00:03:22.630> instead<00:03:22.959> of<00:03:23.019> replacing<00:03:23.500> their<00:03:23.769> help<00:03:23.950> I
