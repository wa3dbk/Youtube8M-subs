00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
it two frets towards the twelfth fret so

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.120 
it two frets towards the twelfth fret so
you<00:01:28.810> are<00:01:28.930> now<00:01:29.080> on<00:01:29.259> the<00:01:29.290> fourth<00:01:29.680> and<00:01:29.830> the<00:01:29.890> sixth

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
you are now on the fourth and the sixth

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.330 
you are now on the fourth and the sixth
fret

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.389 

it's<00:01:33.340> an<00:01:33.460> exposition

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:41.169 

the<00:01:39.399> second<00:01:39.729> part<00:01:39.970> I<00:01:40.119> think<00:01:40.180> is

00:01:41.169 --> 00:01:41.179 
the second part I think is

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:43.719 
the second part I think is
variation<00:01:42.140> of<00:01:42.259> an<00:01:42.409> F<00:01:42.560> minor<00:01:42.859> F<00:01:43.219> sharp<00:01:43.490> minor

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
variation of an F minor F sharp minor

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.770 
variation of an F minor F sharp minor
chord<00:01:45.250> the<00:01:46.250> next<00:01:46.640> position<00:01:46.880> is<00:01:47.119> a<00:01:47.179> variation

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
chord the next position is a variation

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.320 
chord the next position is a variation
of<00:01:47.840> a<00:01:47.960> G<00:01:48.109> sharp
