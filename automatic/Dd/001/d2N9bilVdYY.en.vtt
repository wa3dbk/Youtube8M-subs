00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
is with the development that I've done

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.270 
is with the development that I've done
the<00:03:12.630> testing<00:03:13.019> on<00:03:13.170> twisty<00:03:13.560> roads<00:03:13.769> it<00:03:14.010> really

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
the testing on twisty roads it really
