would say for freshman year is to make a

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.590 
would say for freshman year is to make a
plan<00:02:07.100> for<00:02:07.610> what<00:02:07.790> classes<00:02:08.209> you're<00:02:08.390> going<00:02:08.420> to

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
plan for what classes you're going to

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.719 
plan for what classes you're going to
take<00:02:08.810> rather<00:02:09.259> than<00:02:09.619> I<00:02:09.920> think<00:02:10.280> you<00:02:10.399> should<00:02:10.579> take

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
take rather than I think you should take

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.870 
take rather than I think you should take
some<00:02:10.790> like<00:02:11.180> spontaneous<00:02:12.049> ones<00:02:12.260> too<00:02:12.650> but<00:02:12.920> have

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
some like spontaneous ones too but have

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.420 
some like spontaneous ones too but have
an<00:02:14.000> idea<00:02:14.239> of<00:02:14.299> what<00:02:14.570> GES<00:02:15.079> and<00:02:15.500> major<00:02:15.709> stuff<00:02:16.160> you

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
an idea of what GES and major stuff you

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.970 
an idea of what GES and major stuff you
should<00:02:16.640> take<00:02:16.850> because<00:02:17.720> I<00:02:18.440> just<00:02:18.680> took<00:02:18.769> a<00:02:18.829> bunch

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
should take because I just took a bunch

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.190 
should take because I just took a bunch
of<00:02:19.130> random<00:02:19.489> stuff<00:02:19.670> and<00:02:19.730> it<00:02:19.970> was<00:02:20.060> fun<00:02:20.329> and<00:02:20.720> I

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
of random stuff and it was fun and I

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.660 
of random stuff and it was fun and I
guess<00:02:21.380> if<00:02:21.500> you<00:02:21.590> if<00:02:21.950> you<00:02:22.070> don't<00:02:22.190> know<00:02:22.310> what<00:02:22.549> you

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
guess if you if you don't know what you

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.100 
guess if you if you don't know what you
want<00:02:22.850> to<00:02:22.940> do<00:02:23.090> that's<00:02:23.630> a<00:02:23.780> good<00:02:23.930> way<00:02:24.079> to<00:02:24.110> go<00:02:24.380> but
