actually<00:00:32.009> six<00:00:32.719> people<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:34.530> design

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
actually six people that design

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.510 
actually six people that design
prototype<00:00:35.780> market<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:36.960> test<00:00:37.469> all<00:00:37.860> of<00:00:38.370> their

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
prototype market and test all of their

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.880 
prototype market and test all of their
products<00:00:38.969> what's<00:00:39.600> great<00:00:40.020> about<00:00:40.050> them<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:40.649> they

we actually saw their full prototype

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.880 
we actually saw their full prototype
lineup<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.030> from<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.719> styrofoam<00:00:49.410> version

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
lineup and from the styrofoam version

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.010

all the way up to the 3d printed near
final<00:00:52.410> models<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.399> quite<00:00:53.879> impressive<00:00:54.600> to

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
final models it is quite impressive to

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.170 
final models it is quite impressive to
see<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.140> number<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.620> iterations<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:57.000> they

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
see the number of iterations that they

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.770 
see the number of iterations that they
went<00:00:57.360> through

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
went through

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.790
