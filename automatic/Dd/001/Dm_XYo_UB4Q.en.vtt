00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:05.670
 in several videos 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.819

 more for lovely out there 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:26.930
 I do not hate what a pity I think that 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.260
 also that we killed him because I think that 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.819
 this time he stopped firing 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:37.020

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:38.490

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:49.770
 well let's go to the game 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.710
 what they hold is worth vale vale vale 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.970
 voucher voucher 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:04:00.780
 but it could attack large waiting payment 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.780
 very well 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.120
 I kept bugging me to throw the attack 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.700
 super absurd aerial 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.090
 here and here and here does vale go too 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.799
 because if I will not have died in vain 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.780
 one 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.290
 worth a week is going to feel the one that had 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.450
 there and that's it 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.800

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.750

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.800

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.800
 voucher voucher 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:39.599
 I've seen the trick had to come another 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.599
 on the right 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:46.000
 surely he chases me 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:56.940
 and I thought I had killed 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:59.850

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:02.030

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.030
 do not 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:12.640
 33 and better because it's the last attack 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:17.790
 from there he has killed before one has fallen 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:19.830
 in that angle 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:22.260
