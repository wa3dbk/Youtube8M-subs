00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.460
 controller we will be able to install from 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.649
 most correct way to our 360 control 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.499
 and in addition to a small application that 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:47.659
 will help us to get help whether they are 

00:00:45.499 --> 00:00:49.339
 mini headphones on your keyboard 

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:52.760
 control or on other devices 

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:55.150
 wireless controls obviously 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.430

 description of the video I'm going to leave you 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.489
 this link to be clicked from the 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.409
 microsoft hardware page 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.790
 and well here it gives us what it is 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.509
 a great information to be able 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.030
 download what is the driver and 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:17.040
 well if you have it in Spanish this page 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.979
 they only change from country to Spain or 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.840
 mexico there is no problem in the system 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.119
 operative you use if you do not know what 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.610
 operating system you have only go 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.930
 to my pc or equipment and properties of 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:33.410
 system and I am doing it 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:36.470
 and he tells me it's windows 7 and I also know 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:39.010
 that the bit version in this case is 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.010
 64 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:46.790
 windows 7 of 64 to and check that this 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.940
 software and driver and the language what 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:52.940
 come down in Spanish or the language that you 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:57.490
 prefer and only we would have to give 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.490
 click on the download button 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.650
 this tutorial to many will seem 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.370
 very 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:07.860
 very incoherent or very very bad because of 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:11.160
 that once you connect your control to 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.080
 what is windows 7 is installed so 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.350
 correct but what is this driver 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.210
 is also enable either what is the 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.080
 port for the headphones so that 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.880
 you can use on skype 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.270
 also to be able to use the microphone 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:27.640
 besides that it gives you a lot of help 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.500
 for other wireless controls 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.970
 well once downloaded what is this 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.920
 the controller let's click 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.920
 right or open 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.670
 then we will come out what is the 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.560
 window or the wizard as they say 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.069
 here you can see what the terms are 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.780
 License Agreement Software 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:51.330
 let's click on accepted the contract 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:53.700
 but check well if there are any 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.000
 inconsistency or something they do not like 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.770
 but generally we do not leave it to anyone 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.380
 to right click on next 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:05.410
 and either we are installing what is 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:07.030
 the controller further our pc 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.280
 is going to install the props I tell you 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.810
 that gives us help for the devices 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.810
 wireless wireless controls 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.879
 also 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:21.329
 and it's going to be a simple way to be able 

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:22.800
 optimize your xbox 360 control in 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:25.230
 windows 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.270
 or forgot to tell me here in what system 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.060
 used can choose between 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.920
 view or xp only check the version 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.540
 have in this case the shit of 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.540
 windows 7 64 bits 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:40.150
 minimized that and has well installed 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.990
 correctly the accessories software 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.610
 microsoft xbox 360 this what is the 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.620
 software accessories is an application 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.530
 that I tell you that it only installs 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:53.110
 we click on finalize 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.330
 it's going to take a little bit here then leave 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.459
 a video of how I did it to install 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:01.150
 what is my 360 control in a way 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:04.690
 incorrect would only connect by 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:07.930
 middle of the usb port to our pc either 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:10.239
