00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:47.269 
looks better stats wise but in game is

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:49.090 
looks better stats wise but in game is
completed<00:03:47.780> in<00:03:47.870> story<00:03:48.140> but<00:03:48.470> yeah<00:03:48.620> just<00:03:48.980> got

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
completed in story but yeah just got

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.319 
completed in story but yeah just got
really<00:03:49.280> lucky<00:03:49.489> appeared<00:03:49.910> as<00:03:50.030> i<00:03:50.060> said<00:03:50.299> earlier

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:50.329

so<00:03:50.840> on<00:03:51.560> to<00:03:51.709> my<00:03:51.799> Strikeforce<00:03:52.370> we<00:03:52.670> first<00:03:52.910> have

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
so on to my Strikeforce we first have

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.729 
so on to my Strikeforce we first have
cosine<00:03:53.420> of<00:03:53.480> my<00:03:53.810> center<00:03:54.140> forward<00:03:54.560> and

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
cosine of my center forward and

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:56.830 
cosine of my center forward and
surprisingly<00:03:55.670> he<00:03:55.850> was<00:03:55.970> fantastic<00:03:56.540> because<00:03:56.600> he

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
surprisingly he was fantastic because he

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.780 
surprisingly he was fantastic because he
was<00:03:56.959> also<00:03:57.170> another<00:03:57.620> guy<00:03:57.890> just<00:03:57.950> in<00:03:58.310> the<00:03:58.459> same

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
was also another guy just in the same

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.460 
was also another guy just in the same
formation<00:03:59.239> just<00:03:59.600> like<00:03:59.720> Tyler<00:04:00.140> Tyler

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
formation just like Tyler Tyler

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.890 
formation just like Tyler Tyler
situation<00:04:01.130> of<00:04:01.459> all<00:04:01.880> cosine<00:04:02.510> is<00:04:02.660> not<00:04:02.780> when

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
situation of all cosine is not when

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.810 
situation of all cosine is not when
you're<00:04:02.989> gonna<00:04:03.079> fit<00:04:03.350> in<00:04:03.380> his<00:04:03.530> team<00:04:03.799> but<00:04:04.100> I<00:04:04.280> was

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
you're gonna fit in his team but I was

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.699 
you're gonna fit in his team but I was
