actually make a cultured butter so what

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.480 
actually make a cultured butter so what
we're<00:00:11.099> doing<00:00:11.130> is<00:00:11.610> we're<00:00:11.910> adding<00:00:12.410> like

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:13.490 
we're doing is we're adding like

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.310 
we're doing is we're adding like
bacteria<00:00:14.490> to<00:00:14.730> our<00:00:14.910> cream<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.540> sour<00:00:15.870> it<00:00:16.109> so

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
bacteria to our cream to sour it so

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.109 
bacteria to our cream to sour it so
we're<00:00:16.470> making<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:16.859> sour<00:00:17.100> cream<00:00:17.520> and<00:00:17.789> then<00:00:17.970> we

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
we're making a sour cream and then we

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.060 
we're making a sour cream and then we
churn<00:00:18.330> our<00:00:18.570> butter<00:00:18.779> with<00:00:18.990> that<00:00:19.230> so<00:00:19.710> all<00:00:19.920> your

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
churn our butter with that so all your

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.160 
churn our butter with that so all your
cream<00:00:20.400> is<00:00:20.430> sourced<00:00:21.060> locally<00:00:21.720> like<00:00:21.869> lately

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
cream is sourced locally like lately

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.349 
cream is sourced locally like lately
we're<00:00:22.529> belly<00:00:22.710> so<00:00:23.130> high<00:00:23.310> country<00:00:23.550> cows

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
we're belly so high country cows

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.460 
we're belly so high country cows
I<00:00:24.420> thought<00:00:24.660> is<00:00:24.779> something<00:00:25.019> we<00:00:25.080> know<00:00:25.230> and<00:00:25.439> love

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
I thought is something we know and love

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.259 
I thought is something we know and love
and<00:00:25.619> something<00:00:25.980> we<00:00:26.099> use<00:00:26.250> every<00:00:26.400> day<00:00:26.640> but<00:00:26.699> there

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
and something we use every day but there

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.550 
and something we use every day but there
are<00:00:27.449> still<00:00:27.689> some<00:00:27.930> of<00:00:28.050> us<00:00:28.140> out<00:00:28.260> there<00:00:28.439> have

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
are still some of us out there have

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.919 
are still some of us out there have
actually<00:00:28.830> no<00:00:29.099> idea<00:00:29.240> whether<00:00:30.240> it's<00:00:30.449> from<00:00:30.689> and

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
actually no idea whether it's from and

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.840 
actually no idea whether it's from and
what<00:00:31.230> goes<00:00:31.380> into<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.650> process<00:00:31.830> okay<00:00:32.520> so<00:00:32.579> we

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
what goes into the process okay so we

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.450 
what goes into the process okay so we
get<00:00:32.969> our<00:00:33.120> thousand<00:00:33.719> liters<00:00:34.020> in<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.440> we<00:00:35.130> put<00:00:35.340> it

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
get our thousand liters in and we put it

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.520 
get our thousand liters in and we put it
into<00:00:35.610> our<00:00:35.880> tank<00:00:36.120> here<00:00:36.510> which<00:00:36.809> is<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.079> heating

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
into our tank here which is a heating

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.290 
into our tank here which is a heating
tank<00:00:37.800> and<00:00:38.040> we<00:00:38.100> heat<00:00:38.309> it<00:00:38.340> up<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.730> about<00:00:38.760> 20

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
tank and we heat it up to about 20

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.970 
tank and we heat it up to about 20
degrees<00:00:39.629> because<00:00:40.110> we<00:00:40.140> don't<00:00:40.440> want<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.710> heat<00:00:40.950> it

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
degrees because we don't want to heat it

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.920 
degrees because we don't want to heat it
too<00:00:41.309> high<00:00:41.610> because<00:00:42.210> we<00:00:42.360> don't<00:00:42.600> want<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:42.809> kill

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
too high because we don't want to kill

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.080 
too high because we don't want to kill
that<00:00:43.140> butter<00:00:43.350> fat<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:44.100> 20<00:00:44.489> degrees<00:00:44.789> is<00:00:44.969> about

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
that butter fat and 20 degrees is about

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.810 
that butter fat and 20 degrees is about
room<00:00:45.480> temperature<00:00:46.200> which<00:00:46.500> is<00:00:46.820> traditionally

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
room temperature which is traditionally

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.119 
room temperature which is traditionally
what<00:00:48.000> you<00:00:48.149> did<00:00:48.360> with<00:00:48.600> your<00:00:49.260> cream<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:49.739> left<00:00:49.980> it

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
what you did with your cream you left it

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.220 
what you did with your cream you left it
out<00:00:50.280> overnight<00:00:50.700> on<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.149> bench<00:00:51.449> at<00:00:51.960> room

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
out overnight on the bench at room

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.279 
out overnight on the bench at room
temperature<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.520> natural<00:00:53.940> wild<00:00:54.449> you

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
temperature and the natural wild you

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.770 
temperature and the natural wild you
know<00:00:55.440> lactic<00:00:55.890> bacteria<00:00:56.480> cell<00:00:57.480> would<00:00:57.660> the

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
know lactic bacteria cell would the

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.660 
know lactic bacteria cell would the
cream<00:00:58.020> naturally<00:00:58.590> when<00:00:59.070> we're<00:00:59.219> happy<00:00:59.489> with

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
cream naturally when we're happy with

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.599 
cream naturally when we're happy with
the<00:01:00.059> temperature<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.020> pH<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.379> our<00:01:01.890> cream

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
the temperature and the pH of our cream

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.350 
the temperature and the pH of our cream
then<00:01:03.030> we<00:01:03.270> pump<00:01:03.539> it<00:01:03.690> over<00:01:04.019> into<00:01:04.470> our<00:01:04.500> churn<00:01:05.010> and

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
then we pump it over into our churn and

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.020 
then we pump it over into our churn and
we<00:01:06.360> turn<00:01:06.810> our<00:01:07.020> butter<00:01:07.260> so<00:01:07.740> it's<00:01:08.159> like<00:01:08.400> throwing

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
we turn our butter so it's like throwing

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.940 
we turn our butter so it's like throwing
water<00:01:09.360> balloons<00:01:09.630> against<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.380> wall<00:01:10.530> the

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
water balloons against the wall the

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.580 
water balloons against the wall the
butter<00:01:11.220> fat<00:01:11.520> in<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:12.210> cream<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:12.900> in<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.350> water

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
butter fat in the cream is in a water

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.070 
butter fat in the cream is in a water
balloon<00:01:13.770> and<00:01:14.189> as<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.970> add<00:01:15.180> youtaite<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.900> it's

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
balloon and as you add youtaite it it's

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.410 
balloon and as you add youtaite it it's
like<00:01:16.259> bashing<00:01:16.799> those<00:01:16.979> together<00:01:17.430> they<00:01:18.119> burst

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
like bashing those together they burst

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.840 
like bashing those together they burst
and<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:19.350> butter<00:01:19.560> fat<00:01:19.770> sticks<00:01:20.159> together<00:01:20.369> and

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
and the butter fat sticks together and

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.880 
and the butter fat sticks together and
the<00:01:21.270> liquid<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.780> runs<00:01:22.020> free<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.650> the

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
the liquid that runs free is the

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.740 
the liquid that runs free is the
buttermilk<00:01:23.180> so<00:01:24.180> we'll<00:01:25.100> get<00:01:26.100> our<00:01:26.280> chin<00:01:26.610> started

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.420 

as<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:30.810> guys<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.590> Helen<00:01:31.860> is<00:01:31.920> this<00:01:32.070> process

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
as you guys and Helen is this process

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.999 
as you guys and Helen is this process
same<00:01:32.610> 45<00:01:33.270> minutes<00:01:33.810> okay<00:01:34.079> you'll<00:01:34.560> know<00:01:34.770> when

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
same 45 minutes okay you'll know when

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.170 
same 45 minutes okay you'll know when
it's<00:01:35.159> ready

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
it's ready

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.810 
it's ready
the<00:01:36.660> buttermilk<00:01:37.080> will<00:01:37.470> actually<00:01:38.010> wash<00:01:38.400> this

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
the buttermilk will actually wash this

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:48.380 
the buttermilk will actually wash this
claim<00:01:40.430> okay<00:01:41.480> it<00:01:42.480> gets<00:01:42.630> just<00:01:42.840> about<00:01:43.140> there<00:01:47.390> so

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
claim okay it gets just about there so

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.470 
claim okay it gets just about there so
then<00:01:48.570> we<00:01:49.020> open<00:01:49.380> up<00:01:49.470> our<00:01:49.650> gate<00:01:50.000> down<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.180> bottom

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:51.480 
then we open up our gate down the bottom

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:57.020 
then we open up our gate down the bottom
here<00:01:52.940> yeah<00:01:53.940> I<00:01:54.530> let<00:01:55.530> my<00:01:55.680> buttermilk<00:01:55.920> out<00:01:56.310> next

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
here yeah I let my buttermilk out next

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.390 
here yeah I let my buttermilk out next
we<00:01:57.750> come<00:01:57.930> over<00:01:58.050> and<00:01:58.230> we<00:01:58.380> pump<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:58.920> into<00:01:59.160> our

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
we come over and we pump it into our

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.940 
we come over and we pump it into our
bucket<00:01:59.640> so<00:02:00.240> over<00:02:00.420> here<00:02:00.600> there's<00:02:01.560> nothing

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
bucket so over here there's nothing
