abandoned communication outpost far out
in<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.439> desert<00:00:19.650> it<00:00:20.010> is<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.520> small<00:00:21.000> map<00:00:21.240> in<00:00:21.480> fact

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
in the desert it is a small map in fact

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.870 
in the desert it is a small map in fact
it's<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.020> smallest<00:00:22.500> map<00:00:22.859> in<00:00:23.039> mw3<00:00:23.460> at<00:00:23.730> this

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
it's the smallest map in mw3 at this

it's the smallest map in mw3 at this
point<00:00:24.090> in<00:00:24.210> time<00:00:24.390> so<00:00:24.900> expect<00:00:25.289> plenty<00:00:25.529> of<00:00:25.740> close

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980
