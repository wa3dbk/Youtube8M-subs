00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:22.990 
quick walk through the steps I took for

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.769 
quick walk through the steps I took for
winterization<00:00:23.650> and<00:00:24.390> then<00:00:25.390> I'll<00:00:25.510> walk<00:00:25.630> you

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:25.779 
winterization and then I'll walk you

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:31.710 
winterization and then I'll walk you
through<00:00:25.810> the<00:00:26.080> startup<00:00:26.260> procedure<00:00:30.660> hey<00:00:31.660> so

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
through the startup procedure hey so

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.060 
through the startup procedure hey so
this<00:00:32.020> is<00:00:32.079> the<00:00:32.349> first<00:00:32.590> time<00:00:32.770> I've<00:00:32.920> actually

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
this is the first time I've actually

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.550 
this is the first time I've actually
stored<00:00:33.610> a<00:00:33.730> car<00:00:33.940> for<00:00:34.150> the<00:00:34.210> winter<00:00:34.570> I<00:00:35.020> wasn't

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:35.560 
stored a car for the winter I wasn't

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.889 
stored a car for the winter I wasn't
really<00:00:35.650> sure<00:00:35.920> what<00:00:36.100> the<00:00:36.190> process<00:00:36.670> was<00:00:36.940> but<00:00:37.660> I

00:00:37.889 --> 00:00:37.899 
really sure what the process was but I

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:39.540 
really sure what the process was but I
decided<00:00:38.260> to<00:00:38.470> do<00:00:38.590> a<00:00:38.620> lot<00:00:38.829> of<00:00:38.950> research<00:00:39.280> on<00:00:39.430> the

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
decided to do a lot of research on the

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.340 
decided to do a lot of research on the
forums<00:00:39.940> and<00:00:40.210> trying<00:00:40.540> to<00:00:40.600> understand<00:00:40.989> what

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
forums and trying to understand what

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.799 
forums and trying to understand what
steps<00:00:41.680> I<00:00:41.860> should<00:00:42.070> take<00:00:42.280> to<00:00:43.180> ensure<00:00:43.329> the<00:00:43.600> car

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:43.809 
steps I should take to ensure the car

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:45.420 
steps I should take to ensure the car
comes<00:00:44.019> out<00:00:44.140> of<00:00:44.260> hibernation<00:00:44.440> relatively

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 
comes out of hibernation relatively

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.950 
comes out of hibernation relatively
smoothly<00:00:46.500> so<00:00:47.500> to<00:00:48.070> my<00:00:48.190> surprise<00:00:48.359> it's<00:00:49.359> fairly

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
smoothly so to my surprise it's fairly

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.160 
smoothly so to my surprise it's fairly
basic<00:00:50.140> and<00:00:50.800> not<00:00:51.070> much<00:00:51.280> was<00:00:51.489> required<00:00:52.050> let<00:00:53.050> me

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
basic and not much was required let me

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.630 
basic and not much was required let me
just<00:00:53.500> give<00:00:53.679> you<00:00:53.710> a<00:00:53.829> quick<00:00:54.039> walkthrough<00:00:54.280> of<00:00:54.489> all

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
just give you a quick walkthrough of all

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.669 
just give you a quick walkthrough of all
the<00:00:54.789> steps<00:00:55.390> I<00:00:55.539> took<00:00:55.600> starting<00:00:56.320> with<00:00:56.410> the<00:00:56.500> most

00:00:56.669 --> 00:00:56.679 
the steps I took starting with the most

00:00:56.679 --> 00:00:59.579 
the steps I took starting with the most
obvious<00:00:57.129> the<00:00:57.789> car<00:00:58.000> cover<00:00:58.239> it's<00:00:59.140> a<00:00:59.289> good<00:00:59.410> way<00:00:59.559> to

00:00:59.579 --> 00:00:59.589 
obvious the car cover it's a good way to

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:01.529 
obvious the car cover it's a good way to
keep<00:00:59.769> your<00:00:59.920> car<00:01:00.100> clean<00:01:00.160> and<00:01:00.760> people<00:01:01.179> would<00:01:01.390> be

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:01.539 
keep your car clean and people would be

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:03.150 
keep your car clean and people would be
less<00:01:01.839> inclined<00:01:02.289> to<00:01:02.440> use<00:01:02.649> the<00:01:02.829> car<00:01:03.039> as<00:01:03.129> a

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
less inclined to use the car as a

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.910 
less inclined to use the car as a
drawing<00:01:03.489> board<00:01:04.199> let<00:01:05.199> me<00:01:05.290> just<00:01:05.500> take<00:01:05.650> this<00:01:05.740> out

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
drawing board let me just take this out

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.150 
drawing board let me just take this out
of<00:01:05.950> the<00:01:06.070> way<00:01:06.540> other<00:01:07.540> than<00:01:07.660> that<00:01:07.990> I<00:01:08.230> connected<00:01:09.070> a

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.160 
of the way other than that I connected a

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.680 
of the way other than that I connected a
trickle<00:01:09.550> charger<00:01:09.909> to<00:01:10.060> the<00:01:10.210> battery

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
trickle charger to the battery

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.290 
trickle charger to the battery
I<00:01:10.900> put<00:01:11.500> stable<00:01:12.040> into<00:01:12.280> the<00:01:12.400> fuel<00:01:12.640> tank<00:01:12.670> I<00:01:13.150> know

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 
I put stable into the fuel tank I know

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.360 
I put stable into the fuel tank I know
this<00:01:13.450> is<00:01:13.600> a<00:01:13.630> bit<00:01:13.840> contested<00:01:14.530> but<00:01:15.100> it<00:01:15.250> is

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:15.370 
this is a bit contested but it is

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.070 
this is a bit contested but it is
designed<00:01:15.580> to<00:01:15.880> slow<00:01:16.090> oxidation<00:01:16.750> of<00:01:16.840> the<00:01:16.930> gas

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
designed to slow oxidation of the gas

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.630 
designed to slow oxidation of the gas
molecules<00:01:17.320> and<00:01:17.770> I<00:01:17.860> did<00:01:18.040> not<00:01:18.220> think<00:01:18.490> it<00:01:18.550> would

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
molecules and I did not think it would

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.360 
molecules and I did not think it would
hurt<00:01:19.080> now<00:01:20.080> the<00:01:20.140> tires<00:01:20.500> this<00:01:20.800> is<00:01:20.950> where<00:01:21.130> it<00:01:21.250> got

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:21.370 
hurt now the tires this is where it got

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.370 
hurt now the tires this is where it got
a<00:01:21.430> bit<00:01:21.730> tricky<00:01:22.210> they're<00:01:22.600> wider<00:01:22.840> range<00:01:23.230> of

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
a bit tricky they're wider range of

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.290 
a bit tricky they're wider range of
options<00:01:23.770> that<00:01:23.890> you<00:01:24.010> can<00:01:24.130> do<00:01:24.280> from<00:01:24.490> nothing<00:01:25.060> to

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300 
options that you can do from nothing to

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.720 
options that you can do from nothing to
putting<00:01:26.110> a<00:01:26.260> car<00:01:26.530> and<00:01:26.650> race<00:01:26.830> Rams<00:01:27.190> putting<00:01:27.670> a

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
car you know to be honest I wanted to

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.140 
car you know to be honest I wanted to
keep<00:01:32.410> it<00:01:32.590> simple<00:01:32.770> and<00:01:33.160> I<00:01:33.220> decided<00:01:33.610> to<00:01:33.850> just

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
keep it simple and I decided to just

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.420 
keep it simple and I decided to just
over<00:01:34.480> inflate<00:01:34.750> my<00:01:34.780> tires<00:01:35.200> and<00:01:35.620> leave<00:01:36.160> it<00:01:36.310> at

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
over inflate my tires and leave it at

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:49.690 
over inflate my tires and leave it at
that

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.380 

all<00:01:50.700> right<00:01:50.820> I'm<00:01:50.880> just<00:01:50.970> gonna<00:01:51.060> walk<00:01:51.270> you

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
all right I'm just gonna walk you

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.270 
all right I'm just gonna walk you
through<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.720> startup<00:01:52.229> procedure<00:01:52.740> it's

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
through the startup procedure it's

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.279 
through the startup procedure it's
pretty<00:01:53.610> basic<00:01:53.729> pretty<00:01:54.299> straightforward<00:01:54.930> but

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:55.289 
pretty basic pretty straightforward but

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:57.440 
pretty basic pretty straightforward but
to<00:01:55.830> be<00:01:55.920> honest<00:01:56.189> I<00:01:56.399> still<00:01:56.429> feel<00:01:56.820> special<00:01:57.330> each

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
to be honest I still feel special each

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.700 
to be honest I still feel special each
time<00:01:57.689> I<00:01:57.869> start<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.470> car

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
time I start the car

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:10.680 
time I start the car
so<00:01:59.700> ignition<00:02:00.539> on

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.540 

next<00:02:11.690> put<00:02:11.930> on<00:02:12.050> brake<00:02:12.260> press<00:02:13.100> and<00:02:13.280> hold<00:02:13.400> the

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
next put on brake press and hold the

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.360 
next put on brake press and hold the
start<00:02:13.760> button<00:02:14.030> right<00:02:14.540> there<00:02:14.570> and<00:02:15.310> let's<00:02:16.310> see

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
start button right there and let's see

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.010 
start button right there and let's see
if<00:02:16.460> it<00:02:16.610> starts<00:02:16.790> a<00:02:19.390> bit<00:02:20.390> of<00:02:20.510> a<00:02:20.600> struggle<00:02:20.840> but

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
if it starts a bit of a struggle but

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.070 
if it starts a bit of a struggle but
we're<00:02:21.590> good<00:02:22.690> so<00:02:23.690> I'm<00:02:23.750> gonna<00:02:23.840> give<00:02:23.990> it<00:02:24.050> some
