 states of www.lexbook.it forgives me 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.170
 facebook at the seventh description and today 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.840
 we are something de de ceglie player 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.150
 inform you today last day indeed it is already 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.860
 the theme of the came out of the packages 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.770
 week number 8 the theme of took over 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.920
 the week number 9 with tevez toni kroos e 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.960
 muller who will be the protagonists of the 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.460
 let's try to inform him he 'll be out tomorrow 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.170
 that is Thursday 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.000
 this is a silver player you are 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.490
 got his version after all 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.380
 two goals trimmed to the inter and is a 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.870
 player that I have tried in the team or it 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.770
 people are in the team but I found it 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.660
 especially in the silver team a 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.270
 that of the video let's try the Argentoni 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.890
 and then I also tried it in 4 3 3 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.910
 alongside of barbo that is it has tried it 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.800
 as s 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.940
 I have to tell you how it does not render 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.640
 because this is a great player 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.110
 great for modules with defense a 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.660
 three for which alternates a good phase 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.780
 offensive also given by the speed 81 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.690
 the 70 passing to a very good one 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.489
 defensive phase so it's a very good one 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.410
 player for three defense modules is 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.180
 I really liked it when it was 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.799
 gold teams made it a lot less because 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.540
 however he still felt a little 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.520
 difference especially for how much 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.170
 regards speed compared to 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.460
 gold players because they usually come 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.170
 used players seem very fast 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.110
 in fact before there was kate then I put it 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.650
 he and I felt a little this change of 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.450
 speed 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.490
 anyway talking about this 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.229
 player we start with the pros and you already have 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.580
 understood that the first pro is the largest 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.710
 proof is the defensive phase 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.420
 this player with 70 defense with 71 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.630
 really good wiretapping 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.390
 value and 75 of slipping silk 64 of 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.490
 marking contrasts commitments 63 a 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.439
 good player especially for how much 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.600
 regards the interceptions and the 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.610
 contrasts do not slip slips of 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.829
 very good value but the contrasts are me 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.490
 very liked when i used it in 4 3 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.560
 3 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.329
 each time it was the first really ad 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.680
 going to defend that is to go to 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.990
 attack the ball carrier already 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.790
 on defense and with this 70 defense 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.860
 he often managed to intercept his own 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.810
 passages or with a contrast or otherwise 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.820
 making the cut right before that 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.259
 the opponent passed then I was enough that 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.240
 the man changed and I found him already ad 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.009
 intercept the ball then the phase 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.560
 defensive both in attack and when 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.489
 in 4 3 3 that when they were 3 4 3 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.440
 more and more 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.970
 I really liked it then I said to tar 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.610
 a good defensive phase to a good one 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.510
 Pope phase 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.880
 offensive because this player 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:20.190
 very much liked his crosses 70 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.190
 passing also here with 59 division 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.410
 good value that I don't quote practically 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.090
 they will belong just mentioned anyway 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.520
 word game suck I don't know what's going on 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.040
 saying 76 of cross 59 of precision 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.290
 punishment 67 of the short passages 58 of 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.980
 long passages 78 of effect and 2 stars 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.140
 weak foot 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.570
 these are the weak penalties that for the passages 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.090
 short and low ground indeed I thought he had 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.470
 three or even well 4 no because every 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.120
 a few passages on the right and 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:48.000
 even a few right-footed shots were wrong 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.320
 but two stars for it is weak I didn't think 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.090
 had made them when I saw them 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.410
 that two-star skill and 2-star pil is 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.790
 weak of the 22 star skills are encounter 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.200
 when i saw this i'm a moment 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.700
 reasoned a broken hands 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.380
 however it has a very good weak foot 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.150
 especially when it comes to doing 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.890
 short passes and then crosses 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.720
 truly sublime it even made me 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.740
 tub signals because it put him a great deal 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.050
 cross on the head 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:12.570
 then we said cross defensive phase 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.760
 Power Shooting and Shooting Steps 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.560
 I don't like its acceleration because 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.269
 however, when the good dribbling 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.100
 since it was missing the two star ski is 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.050
 difficult to reveal with him too 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.630
 because it is not so agile despite 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.940
 79 of agility but it really came 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.350
 outclassed by that control 62 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.600
 70's ball of dribbling is enough 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.430
 good but still not very fast 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.780
 when it comes to accelerating rather 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.940
 I liked it when it was ball and chain 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:38.280
 how he took the step and how I continued 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.170
 in fact, the one in charge of shooting is me 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.640
 very liked and I have to tell you 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.380
 really position up and then there is the 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.330
 power shot his shot is not me 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.640
 especially liked for the 45 of 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.190
 finalization 49 of finalization however 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.360
 70's launch 865 more power than 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.070
 sometimes I had fun saying 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.450
 oh well now even random shot though 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.519
 they always came out of nice shots 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.750
 indeed one even made a practically the 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:59.700
 beard at the pole in any case is a 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.500
 player that 20,000 right if you want 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.330
 only silver of the series to you can 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.410
 spend it or else take others 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:06.360
 tensions since there are of 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.430
 especially good this year 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:11.120
 in the defensive phase in the silver series 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.120
 also bye bye
