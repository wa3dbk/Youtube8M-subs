00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:08.970
 sweet gutters for the shower of 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:08.970
 single storey www.dijon.fr ap point be 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:15.759
 I'm about to install a shower at 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.620
 the Italian is modern at the hand of 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:19.510
 easy to maintain and convenient for 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.860
 get in and out even though it's a 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.670
 work therefore you can 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.830
 make yourself 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.120
 provided you are well prepared and 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:31.090
 take care of one or the other thing in 

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:31.720
 especially for a shower at 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.820
 Italian 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.230
 it is necessary that the walls and the ground form 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.570
 a tight set 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:41.769
 that's why I start by applying 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.719
 this coating I add a protection 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:45.850
 extra in the corners and around 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:47.140
 arrivals for the pipes in order to 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.609
 make sure those places more 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.609
 sensitive be well waterproof 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 I'm done with the walls for 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:09.760
 the moment I will now take care 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.800
 from the gutter and the screed choose from 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.930
 preferably a gutter with a grid 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.180
 and a stainless steel body 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.440
 after the glass it is indeed the 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.440
 most hygienic material 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.960
 of course the length of the gutter 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.580
 depends on the size of the shower so 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.920
 be it more aesthetic 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:39.330
 I keep a distance of about ten 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.330
 centimeters to the parish 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.140
 the break in itself is nothing 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:47.420
 complicated just screw the 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.610
 gutter on the basement to adjust the 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.790
 height and give them to the pipes 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.790
 discharge 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.990
 I will connect this gutter to 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.880
 evacuation using this hose 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.740
 play the coating with a little soap for 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.740
 it slides better on the pipes 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.459
 here is the gutter is horizontal I 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.810
 can start the screed by planning a 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.810
 tilt towards the gutter 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.030
 if I respect a slope of the ground of 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.430
 1 cm per m towards the gutter 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:44.610
 evacuation of water will not cause 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.770
 problem I must now leave to the 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.450
 chap the time to dry after which I 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:56.250
 could go to the finish is at 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:58.080
 tile the coping now 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.540
 hard enough if I'm going to be able 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.220
 ask my waterproofing membrane 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.950
 starting with making a cut out of the 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.140
 size of my gutter this membrane 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.230
 will make the walk-in shower a bin 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.760
 watertight 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.560
 I'm going to stick it on the coping 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.840
 using the same collar as the one that goes 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.830
 serve me just now I'm watching 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.830
 combed glue 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.190
 to stick the membrane I use a kit 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.080
 this polymer as you see it the 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:45.690
 gutter is provided with a gluing frame 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:47.459
 specially provided for this purpose I 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.680
 also covers the joints between the carpet 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:56.400
 and the seams with my kit 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:56.940
 polymer I calculated the slope of the 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.340
 chappe 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.590
 according to that of the profile for that part 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.989
 superior of the latter is well 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:10.800
 level which will facilitate my work 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:13.260
 at the time of karl and once every 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.169
 profiles in place I'm starting the tiling 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.209
 soil as soon as the glue and paint that 

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:19.669
 I like and custom tiling I can 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.720
 To put myself 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:23.460
 I have to make sure that 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.729
 tiles that surround the gutter 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:30.290
 overhangs it from 1 to 2 mm so that the water 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:30.290
 flows without difficulty 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:42.000
 I put the tiles by practicing a 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:45.560
 2mm seal for ease I use 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.560
 Spacer braces 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.810
 when the glue comes out I use a 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.960
 rubber mass to align all 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:58.000
 the tiles once the parish 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:01.540
 and carl and I can do the joints as soon as 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.450
 the next day to get the 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:14.140
 produced in the joints I do it in 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:15.910
 diagonally I do not join the 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.890
 parish in one go not to 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.710
 risk that the superfluous products dries 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:24.670
 on the tiles 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:27.220
 so I'll go clean waits a 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:29.620
 good advice when cleaning walls 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.660
 we know how to use two jumps one of water 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.390
 clear and the other to rinse your 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.710
 sponge 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:38.500
 do not be afraid of them repeated the operation 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.160
 several times by first going with 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.590
 the sponge 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.900
 then with a dry cloth until 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.790
 the cement veil disappear if you 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.700
 do not manage to host is fully 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:52.510
 used an elongated specific solvent 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:54.510
 of water you can start to chew 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:56.800
 as soon as the joints are dry 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:58.810
 I can not use mortar 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.060
 ordinary for this joint between 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:02.530
 tiles and profile in stainless he 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.960
 did not adhere to stainless steel 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:07.410
 on the other hand a kit this polymer will do very 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.410
 good to do 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.030
 he
