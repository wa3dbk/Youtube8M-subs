 moment on your PC screen 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.269

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.400
 Of course you are still automatic 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.550

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:41.730
 any place tor and then needed 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:44.430
 namely this app for iphone explorer 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:48.660

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.960
 I hope he is clearer now 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.640
 I have with them I have it just like that 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.740
 about two minutes also did not get 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.240
 that the new one I had just before 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.560
 that is still the old one 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.829
 I think it's not bad right now 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.480
 if i'm cool if you want i can 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.489
 then again extra preview is 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.710
 However, you do not really care about me 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.750
 with say write in the comments like that 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.860
 yes that's what you need on the phone 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.360
 this iphone explorer 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.710
 Of course, I'll send you that again 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.790
 link in the description it could be 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.610
 Download pc 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.170
 then you need the pc again that 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.530
 program is called my iphone explorer 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.820
 you get this on schi as always 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.159
 the legendary euro 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.680
 also in the description then, according to ace 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.450
 down and then if you started that 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.370
 are synonymous want to synchronize your mobile phone 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.470
 If you agree , then all the data has 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:38.520
 everything stored here on the pc takes 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:41.520
 a whole while so the program can 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.409
 one also uses to data from the pc 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.390
 to pull on the phone from clocks and 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.970
 to synchronize clocks eat it 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.100
 original so sync everything 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.260
 and so on over and over 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.720
 To update 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.580
 But that's why I did not want that 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.330
 I wanted to show you how you are 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.939
 your screen on the phone because on 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.470
 So you get your pc click here 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.659
 on extra after your your cellphone 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:09.860
 I should also have connected myself 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.860
 a mobile phone as set moment 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.180
 in play me it big again so exactly 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.100
 Just give it to you whenever you want it 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.740
 click on extra and the screen 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:23.940
 you have to show up here automatically 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:25.260
 click update because otherwise it does 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.570
 he does not go with somehow 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.490
 no idea if you have to go here 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.990
 and how to refresh it with click 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.450
 ass number 9 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:37.680
 Here then so is only just one time 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:40.650
 settings at the moment so here in 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.980
 settings and then on developers 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.840
 options so that would have to be with everyone 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.700
 this development option will be there then 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.770
 would have to park this up here yet 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.810
 put it down so anyone could hire 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.640
 then you click below usb debates 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.390
 if you have not already turned it on 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.700
 have wanted to show it again then yes 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.490
 just like I said mom I just shows 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.610
 we close very briefly again 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:09.180
 time here for extra so special then 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.560
 load mobile screenshot and then load 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.450
 you have to here automatically 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.420
 you can still refresh the 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:19.440
 Choose size how big it should be 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.830
 i have 77 it is the biggest and is in 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.900
 order 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:25.760
 then it could also be from the pc 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.209
 I could just control here now 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.680
 click 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:33.180
 and then he brings me to the 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:34.440
 So settings of ton here and there 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.610
 has indeed again debates which one 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:45.510
 usually has home and back 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:47.070
 attitudes and that's how old it is here 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:51.390
 it's easy to use 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:53.130
 it's just not the fastest licking 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.450
 a bit like that, though it is in 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:56.730
 order for people like you just short 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.220
 the show wants to show an app 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.110
 I now for example after 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.209
 next time it can show better 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.800
 So it looks right now 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.330
 can read because that has any 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.709
 the camera was a shit quality 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.590
 sorry for that 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:13.010
 so I can convince here 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.239
 then stop a bit slower though 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.650
 I should not think so 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.160
 Bad because I will not show you any now 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.470
 games 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.720
 so this should be here 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.030
 be feasible yes as I said still 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.860
 on the 4.12 to it can still one 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.120
