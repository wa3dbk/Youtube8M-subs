00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 always try to change to adapt 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.240
 evolve we have always searched 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.820
 improve as individual musicians and as 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.050
 band not then I think it fits 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.170
 pretty good at what we have always 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.170
 searched 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.370
 we meet and start working 

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:21.640
 first with covers and then with 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:23.950
 unpublished music first pop rock the first 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.170
 disco was a little more latin pop rock is 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:29.040
 a mix between pop and rock rock a 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:32.110
 rhythm a little loud and pop a line 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.270
 more commercial if so let me started 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.280
 composing their own themes in that 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.829
 vision and in the battery format 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:42.040
 guitars and singer through time 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:44.559
 because it has been modifying that more than 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.989
 towards a commercial vision towards a 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:48.970
 vision of creating music that we 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.520
 Complement that comes to us and always 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:54.490
 we have looked for new new ways of 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.220
 compose new ways to produce a 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:59.590
 year more is a very nice subject because it is 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.570
 a theme that I wrote for a friend who 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.239
 I was on an anniversary with the girlfriend and 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.920
 creates dedicated the typical serene with a 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.540
 song coves then he told me the 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.000
 more or less history of what the 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:13.560
 relationship and I became the 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.560
 interpreter of that story let's say 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.700
 look 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:34.299
 Saavedra 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:49.770
 remember when you and I met 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:56.280
 if not 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.280
 it was what 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.890
 black 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.890
 now 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:15.840
 At first I was afraid to touch the 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:19.099
 piano of kissing 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.099
 well where 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:25.459
 and they will squeeze dead alone 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.860
 because life 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:42.910
 in agreement we do not want more 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.830
 and I do not want any more VAT 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.020
 you will see 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.410
 when we say 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:21.520
 do not forget all 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.459
 you 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.830
 two 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:46.709
 according to that 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.780
 the life 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:04.390
 not bad 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:08.610
 no more 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.610
 and every day why 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.300
 two 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.349
 all right 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:22.060
 according to term 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:30.310
 we are not without singing 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.540
 I love you more and more 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.550
 Y 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:49.460
 talk about the past talk about the del 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:52.430
 future of things that seem good to us 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.990
 of what does not also seem to us of the 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.819
 beautiful landscape that we have here in 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.949

00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:59.629

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:03.999
 people be as is and inspired us to 

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:03.999
