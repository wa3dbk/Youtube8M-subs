00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.049 
925 which came out earlier this year so
double<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.620> design<00:00:14.009> a<00:00:14.040> lot<00:00:14.370> of<00:00:14.460> similarities

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
double the design a lot of similarities

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.000 
double the design a lot of similarities
between<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.540> Nokia<00:00:15.809> Lumia<00:00:15.839> 1520<00:00:16.260> I'm<00:00:16.740> gonna

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
between the Nokia Lumia 1520 I'm gonna

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.890 
between the Nokia Lumia 1520 I'm gonna
killing<00:00:17.279> me<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.369> 925<00:00:17.910> that<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.390> we<00:00:18.480> thought<00:00:18.690> if

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
killing me a 925 that and we thought if

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.460 
killing me a 925 that and we thought if
give<00:00:19.080> it<00:00:19.199> a<00:00:19.230> quick<00:00:19.470> comparison<00:00:21.080> so<00:00:22.080> Steve

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
give it a quick comparison so Steve

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.750 
give it a quick comparison so Steve

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
8.1 on the 15 penny really welcome

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.490 
8.1 on the 15 penny really welcome
update<00:00:54.469> so<00:00:56.180> that's<00:00:57.180> that<00:00:57.570> terms<00:00:58.260> of<00:00:58.410> the

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
update so that's that terms of the

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.360 
update so that's that terms of the
design<00:00:58.680> though<00:01:00.350> 925<00:01:01.350> is<00:01:01.590> super<00:01:02.010> lightweight

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
design though 925 is super lightweight

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.539 
design though 925 is super lightweight
and<00:01:03.059> it's<00:01:03.539> only<00:01:03.660> about<00:01:03.809> 139<00:01:04.350> grams<00:01:04.619> whereas

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
and it's only about 139 grams whereas

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:09.490 
and it's only about 139 grams whereas
1520<00:01:06.299> is<00:01:06.360> about<00:01:06.570> 210<00:01:07.530> grams<00:01:07.799> thickness<00:01:08.790> wise

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
1520 is about 210 grams thickness wise

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.240 
1520 is about 210 grams thickness wise
it's<00:01:10.500> about<00:01:11.299> 8.5<00:01:12.299> or<00:01:12.600> 8.7<00:01:13.380> search<00:01:13.590> Valley<00:01:13.860> the

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
it's about 8.5 or 8.7 search Valley the

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.940 
it's about 8.5 or 8.7 search Valley the
same<00:01:14.490> thickness

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
same thickness

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.459 
same thickness
and<00:01:16.070> that's<00:01:16.640> that<00:01:17.030> so<00:01:17.390> let's<00:01:17.960> quickly<00:01:18.110> go<00:01:18.439> over

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:18.469 
and that's that so let's quickly go over

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:20.889 
and that's that so let's quickly go over
to<00:01:18.710> the<00:01:18.829> back<00:01:19.299> design<00:01:20.299> language<00:01:20.509> of<00:01:20.810> the

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
to the back design language of the

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:22.779 
to the back design language of the
camera<00:01:21.259> placement<00:01:21.560> it's<00:01:22.070> very<00:01:22.219> similar<00:01:22.490> and

00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:22.789 
camera placement it's very similar and

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:24.819 
camera placement it's very similar and
even<00:01:23.329> the<00:01:23.479> speaker<00:01:23.869> grill<00:01:24.110> replacement<00:01:24.320> as

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:24.829 
even the speaker grill replacement as

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:26.980 
even the speaker grill replacement as
well<00:01:25.009> so<00:01:25.670> you<00:01:26.060> can<00:01:26.090> see<00:01:26.299> this<00:01:26.420> has<00:01:26.479> a<00:01:26.600> pretty

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
well so you can see this has a pretty

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.459 
well so you can see this has a pretty
hazard<00:01:28.179> many<00:01:29.179> megapixel<00:01:29.689> camera<00:01:29.990> along<00:01:30.229> with

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:30.469 
hazard many megapixel camera along with

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:33.520 
hazard many megapixel camera along with
a<00:01:30.590> dual<00:01:30.740> LED<00:01:30.920> flash<00:01:31.329> very<00:01:32.329> similar<00:01:32.720> to<00:01:32.750> the<00:01:32.840> 925

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
a dual LED flash very similar to the 925

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.039 
a dual LED flash very similar to the 925
which<00:01:33.860> also<00:01:34.039> has<00:01:34.310> a<00:01:34.549> lower<00:01:34.880> megapixel<00:01:35.720> camera

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
which also has a lower megapixel camera

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.919 
which also has a lower megapixel camera
which<00:01:36.259> only<00:01:36.500> a<00:01:36.619> 8<00:01:37.189> megapixel<00:01:37.220> camera<00:01:38.119> but<00:01:38.719> also

00:01:38.919 --> 00:01:38.929 
which only a 8 megapixel camera but also

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:42.609 
which only a 8 megapixel camera but also
with<00:01:39.170> the<00:01:39.259> dual<00:01:39.500> LED<00:01:39.679> flash<00:01:41.380> both<00:01:42.380> have

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:42.619 
with the dual LED flash both have

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:44.440 
with the dual LED flash both have
optical<00:01:42.890> image<00:01:43.159> stabilization<00:01:43.490> garcia's

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
optical image stabilization garcia's

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.399 
optical image stabilization garcia's
optics<00:01:44.840> so<00:01:45.469> same<00:01:46.189> kind<00:01:47.149> of<00:01:47.210> branding<00:01:47.899> yeah<00:01:48.080> but

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409 
optics so same kind of branding yeah but

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:50.109 
optics so same kind of branding yeah but
then<00:01:48.560> the<00:01:48.799> construction<00:01:49.399> of<00:01:49.459> the<00:01:49.580> 50<00:01:49.849> ammonia

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
then the construction of the 50 ammonia

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.010 
then the construction of the 50 ammonia
reminds<00:01:50.810> us<00:01:50.929> of<00:01:51.049> the<00:01:51.229> 1020<00:01:51.890> as<00:01:51.979> well<00:01:52.220> so<00:01:53.020> that's

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
reminds us of the 1020 as well so that's

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.499 
reminds us of the 1020 as well so that's
that<00:01:54.409> so<00:01:54.979> an<00:01:55.039> aluminum<00:01:55.490> frame<00:01:55.789> on<00:01:56.149> the
