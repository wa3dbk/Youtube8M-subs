choppier<00:02:51.320> than<00:02:51.470> i<00:02:51.530> expected<00:02:51.620> especially

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
choppier than i expected especially

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.650 
choppier than i expected especially
because<00:02:52.790> we<00:02:53.300> mentioned<00:02:53.660> dual-core<00:02:55.450> let's<00:02:56.450> see

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
because we mentioned dual-core let's see

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.280 
because we mentioned dual-core let's see
what<00:02:57.230> else<00:02:57.910> let's<00:02:58.910> dive<00:02:59.180> into<00:02:59.360> the<00:02:59.600> app<00:02:59.959> drawer

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
so again this looks exactly like a dozen

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.210

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.880 
the LG optimus z and some of the other
phones<00:03:04.489> and<00:03:04.820> you've<00:03:05.660> got<00:03:05.840> categories<00:03:06.620> of<00:03:06.739> apps

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:36.760 
you know give it a little bit of time

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.070 
you know give it a little bit of time
storage<00:06:37.760> is<00:06:37.820> a<00:06:37.880> little<00:06:38.090> interesting<00:06:38.480> so<00:06:39.020> you

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:39.080 
storage is a little interesting so you

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:41.200 
storage is a little interesting so you
saw<00:06:39.440> the<00:06:39.500> micro<00:06:39.860> SD<00:06:40.100> card<00:06:40.340> earlier<00:06:40.550> but<00:06:41.090> we

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:41.210 
saw the micro SD card earlier but we

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:43.390 
saw the micro SD card earlier but we
also<00:06:41.360> have<00:06:41.480> an<00:06:41.720> internal<00:06:42.200> micro<00:06:42.590> SD<00:06:42.950> card<00:06:43.190> as

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:43.400 
also have an internal micro SD card as

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.390 
also have an internal micro SD card as
well<00:06:43.910> as<00:06:44.330> internal<00:06:44.900> program<00:06:45.800> stored<00:06:46.100> so<00:06:46.280> it's

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400 
well as internal program stored so it's

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.590 
well as internal program stored so it's
kind<00:06:46.610> of<00:06:46.640> like<00:06:46.730> the<00:06:46.850> droid<00:06:47.000> incredible<00:06:47.120> if<00:06:47.510> you

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:47.600 
kind of like the droid incredible if you

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.390 
kind of like the droid incredible if you
remember<00:06:47.870> that<00:06:48.050> it<00:06:48.260> had<00:06:48.770> kind<00:06:48.980> of<00:06:49.070> extra

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:49.400 
remember that it had kind of extra

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.180 
remember that it had kind of extra
storage<00:06:49.670> so<00:06:50.210> that's<00:06:50.390> cool<00:06:50.540> so<00:06:51.290> you<00:06:51.710> know<00:06:51.800> the

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:52.190 
storage so that's cool so you know the

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:53.650 
storage so that's cool so you know the
way<00:06:52.310> just<00:06:52.550> to<00:06:52.910> think<00:06:53.060> about<00:06:53.240> it<00:06:53.360> is<00:06:53.450> you<00:06:53.570> have

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:53.660 
way just to think about it is you have

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:55.210 
way just to think about it is you have
more<00:06:53.870> than<00:06:53.960> enough<00:06:54.080> space<00:06:54.440> for<00:06:54.800> things<00:06:54.980> right

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:55.220 
more than enough space for things right

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:56.940 
more than enough space for things right
you're<00:06:55.430> not<00:06:55.460> going<00:06:55.730> to<00:06:55.790> run<00:06:55.910> out<00:06:56.030> anytime<00:06:56.300> soon
