00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
exactly why they made the change but uh

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.680 
exactly why they made the change but uh
cats<00:03:01.799> will<00:03:02.040> now<00:03:02.129> sit<00:03:02.370> on<00:03:02.459> chest<00:03:02.760> some<00:03:03.060> beds<00:03:03.360> and

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
cats will now sit on chest some beds and

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.729 
cats will now sit on chest some beds and
furnaces<00:03:04.620> which<00:03:04.920> so<00:03:05.700> true<00:03:05.970> to<00:03:06.090> life<00:03:06.739> other

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
furnaces which so true to life other

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.020 
furnaces which so true to life other
than<00:03:07.799> that<00:03:08.010> let's<00:03:08.250> go<00:03:08.400> ahead<00:03:08.430> and<00:03:08.610> see<00:03:08.730> if<00:03:08.910> I

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
than that let's go ahead and see if I

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.009 
than that let's go ahead and see if I
can't<00:03:09.360> find<00:03:10.880> look<00:03:11.880> they<00:03:12.030> even<00:03:12.060> put<00:03:12.359> the<00:03:12.540> wooden

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
can't find look they even put the wooden

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.530 
can't find look they even put the wooden
plank<00:03:13.620> colors<00:03:14.040> and<00:03:14.280> creative<00:03:14.609> mode<00:03:14.819> here<00:03:15.150> so

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
plank colors and creative mode here so

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.259 
plank colors and creative mode here so
think<00:03:16.500> this<00:03:16.889> is<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.459> wooden<00:03:17.700> planks<00:03:18.060> that<00:03:18.120> you

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
think this is the wooden planks that you

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.590 
think this is the wooden planks that you
get<00:03:18.420> from<00:03:18.450> jungle<00:03:19.139> trees<00:03:19.560> and<00:03:20.160> i<00:03:20.760> will<00:03:21.000> show

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
get from jungle trees and i will show

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:27.589 
get from jungle trees and i will show
you<00:03:21.660> compare<00:03:22.590> that<00:03:22.620> to<00:03:24.920> the<00:03:25.920> other<00:03:26.130> ones<00:03:26.599> here

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 
you compare that to the other ones here

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:31.449 
you compare that to the other ones here
so<00:03:27.810> you<00:03:28.769> can<00:03:28.980> see<00:03:29.280> what<00:03:29.549> they<00:03:29.849> look<00:03:30.090> like

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
so you can see what they look like

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.030 
so you can see what they look like
there's<00:03:32.459> that<00:03:32.700> and<00:03:33.060> then<00:03:33.269> there's<00:03:33.450> the<00:03:33.660> birch

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:34.040 
there's that and then there's the birch

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.280 
there's that and then there's the birch
there's<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.280> normal<00:03:35.669> ones<00:03:35.849> and<00:03:36.180> there's<00:03:36.959> the

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
there's the normal ones and there's the

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.479 
there's the normal ones and there's the
pine<00:03:37.970> so<00:03:38.970> we<00:03:39.209> got<00:03:39.329> a<00:03:39.359> lot<00:03:39.569> more<00:03:39.599> options<00:03:39.959> for

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
pine so we got a lot more options for

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:43.940 
pine so we got a lot more options for
wooden<00:03:41.489> planks<00:03:42.000> there<00:03:42.269> I<00:03:42.510> don't<00:03:43.139> think<00:03:43.680> that

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
wooden planks there I don't think that

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.339 
wooden planks there I don't think that
they<00:03:44.340> change<00:03:44.730> the<00:03:45.030> way<00:03:45.120> slabs<00:03:45.720> look<00:03:46.109> though

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349 
they change the way slabs look though

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:48.199 
they change the way slabs look though
yet<00:03:46.620> but<00:03:46.919> they<00:03:47.069> may<00:03:47.340> end<00:03:47.549> up<00:03:47.700> adding<00:03:47.880> more

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
yet but they may end up adding more

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.370 
yet but they may end up adding more
colors<00:03:48.599> for<00:03:48.870> wooden<00:03:49.109> slabs<00:03:50.989> you<00:03:51.989> can<00:03:52.139> see<00:03:52.260> we

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
colors for wooden slabs you can see we

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.140 
colors for wooden slabs you can see we
have<00:03:52.410> the<00:03:52.709> three<00:03:52.769> sandstone<00:03:53.700> they<00:03:54.000> don't

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
have the three sandstone they don't

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.030 
have the three sandstone they don't
stack<00:03:54.480> but<00:03:54.750> they're<00:03:54.870> all<00:03:54.989> named<00:03:55.290> sandstone

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
stack but they're all named sandstone

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.789 
stack but they're all named sandstone
plus<00:03:56.910> I<00:03:57.120> think<00:03:57.540> there's<00:03:57.870> a<00:03:57.989> way<00:03:58.319> to<00:03:58.430> craft<00:03:59.430> the

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
plus I think there's a way to craft the

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:04.699 
plus I think there's a way to craft the
circle<00:04:01.799> stone<00:04:02.160> bricks<00:04:02.639> now<00:04:02.880> to<00:04:03.290> give<00:04:04.290> me<00:04:04.380> just

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
circle stone bricks now to give me just

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:05.930 
circle stone bricks now to give me just
a<00:04:04.799> moment<00:04:04.889> I'm<00:04:05.099> going<00:04:05.130> to<00:04:05.280> see<00:04:05.430> if<00:04:05.459> I<00:04:05.639> can't

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
a moment I'm going to see if I can't

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.280 
a moment I'm going to see if I can't
figure<00:04:06.150> out<00:04:06.299> how<00:04:06.389> to<00:04:06.599> do<00:04:06.720> that<00:04:06.870> I<00:04:06.930> will<00:04:07.109> be

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
figure out how to do that I will be

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.830 
figure out how to do that I will be
right<00:04:07.560> back<00:04:07.590> with<00:04:07.980> you<00:04:08.150> well<00:04:09.150> there<00:04:09.660> doesn't

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
right back with you well there doesn't

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.080 
right back with you well there doesn't
seem<00:04:10.079> to<00:04:10.380> be<00:04:10.620> a<00:04:10.739> recipe<00:04:11.160> in<00:04:11.280> the<00:04:11.489> game<00:04:11.669> yet<00:04:11.880> for

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
seem to be a recipe in the game yet for

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.650 
seem to be a recipe in the game yet for
this

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
this

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.930 
this
it's<00:04:13.080> possible<00:04:13.380> it<00:04:13.890> may<00:04:14.040> exist<00:04:14.370> or<00:04:14.670> it<00:04:14.760> may<00:04:14.910> not

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
it's possible it may exist or it may not

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
going to stay there and keep coming

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.020 
going to stay there and keep coming
after<00:04:37.950> you<00:04:38.220> and<00:04:40.250> so<00:04:41.250> they<00:04:41.460> are<00:04:41.520> not<00:04:41.640> going<00:04:41.940> to

after you and so they are not going to
go<00:04:42.180> in<00:04:42.360> unless<00:04:43.400> you<00:04:44.400> have<00:04:44.670> it<00:04:44.820> set<00:04:44.850> in<00:04:45.180> such<00:04:45.390> a

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:45.420 
go in unless you have it set in such a

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.120 
go in unless you have it set in such a
way<00:04:45.660> but<00:04:45.720> they<00:04:45.960> will<00:04:46.080> completely<00:04:46.620> fight<00:04:46.980> the

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
way but they will completely fight the

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.550 
way but they will completely fight the
