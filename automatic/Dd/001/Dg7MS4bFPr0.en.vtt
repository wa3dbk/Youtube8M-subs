00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.610 
sociology in politics I personally think
it'd<00:02:24.420> be<00:02:24.450> slightly<00:02:24.720> better<00:02:24.960> if<00:02:25.170> he<00:02:25.260> didn't

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
it'd be slightly better if he didn't

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.090 
it'd be slightly better if he didn't
talk<00:02:25.800> about<00:02:25.860> it<00:02:26.400> in<00:02:26.780> you<00:02:27.780> know<00:02:28.100> psychiatric

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
talk about it in you know psychiatric

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.230
