make<00:00:45.510> themselves<00:00:45.829> unhealthy<00:00:47.329> because<00:00:48.329> I

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
make themselves unhealthy because I

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.779 
make themselves unhealthy because I
think<00:00:48.660> it's<00:00:48.960> important<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:50.750> know<00:00:51.750> how<00:00:52.610> you<00:00:53.610> can

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
think it's important to know how you can

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.080 
think it's important to know how you can
get<00:00:54.030> healthy<00:00:54.449> but<00:00:54.690> also<00:00:55.640> how<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:56.699> can<00:00:56.969> become

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
get healthy but also how you can become

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.360 
get healthy but also how you can become
unhealthy<00:00:57.680> because<00:00:58.680> believe<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.129> or<00:00:59.219> not

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
unhealthy because believe it or not

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.580 
unhealthy because believe it or not
there<00:00:59.640> are<00:00:59.670> some<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.270> people<00:01:00.899> out<00:01:01.050> there<00:01:01.079> who

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
there are some of people out there who

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.340 
there are some of people out there who
actually<00:01:01.620> choose<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:03.270> want<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.080> become

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
actually choose and want to become

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.820 
actually choose and want to become
unhealthy<00:01:05.119> maybe<00:01:06.119> not<00:01:06.420> consciously<00:01:07.409> but

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
unhealthy maybe not consciously but

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.550 
unhealthy maybe not consciously but
subconsciously<00:01:08.430> they<00:01:09.090> do<00:01:09.530> because<00:01:10.530> they

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
subconsciously they do because they

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.450 
subconsciously they do because they
don't<00:01:10.979> really<00:01:11.549> care<00:01:11.700> about<00:01:12.180> themselves<00:01:13.460> see

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
don't really care about themselves see

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.380 
don't really care about themselves see
and<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:15.600> that<00:01:15.840> would<00:01:15.990> be<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.140> path<00:01:16.470> for<00:01:16.979> them

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
and so that would be a path for them

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.870 
and so that would be a path for them
even<00:01:18.390> though<00:01:18.600> logically<00:01:19.439> speaking<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:20.700> would

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
even though logically speaking it would

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.910 
even though logically speaking it would
be<00:01:21.030> very<00:01:21.240> stupid<00:01:22.049> path<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:23.159> take<00:01:23.540> but

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
be very stupid path to take but

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.440 
be very stupid path to take but
unconsciously<00:01:25.920> many<00:01:26.280> people<00:01:26.700> go<00:01:26.909> down<00:01:27.150> that

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
unconsciously many people go down that

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.620 
unconsciously many people go down that
path<00:01:28.430> so<00:01:29.430> if<00:01:30.500> you<00:01:31.500> would<00:01:31.680> like<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.189> become<00:01:33.060> fat

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
path so if you would like to become fat

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.880 
path so if you would like to become fat
and<00:01:34.049> gain<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:34.890> lot<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:35.220> weight<00:01:36.500> what<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:37.650> must

would<00:05:13.330> be<00:05:13.360> good<00:05:13.540> for<00:05:13.720> your<00:05:13.780> health<00:05:13.990> but<00:05:14.140> of

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
would be good for your health but of

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.810 
would be good for your health but of
course<00:05:14.620> on<00:05:14.910> his<00:05:15.910> theory<00:05:16.570> you<00:05:17.500> know<00:05:17.620> biking<00:05:18.370> by

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
course on his theory you know biking by

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.150 
course on his theory you know biking by
raising<00:05:19.090> his<00:05:19.360> body<00:05:19.570> temperature<00:05:19.980> he<00:05:20.980> went

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.160 
raising his body temperature he went

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.740 
raising his body temperature he went
ahead<00:05:21.280> and<00:05:21.580> consumed<00:05:22.030> anything<00:05:22.330> that<00:05:22.660> he

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
ahead and consumed anything that he

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.350 
ahead and consumed anything that he
wanted<00:05:23.140> the<00:05:23.260> junk<00:05:23.710> food<00:05:24.010> and<00:05:24.430> processed<00:05:24.760> foods

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
wanted the junk food and processed foods

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.420 
wanted the junk food and processed foods
and<00:05:25.780> all<00:05:25.840> this<00:05:25.990> stuff<00:05:26.260> but<00:05:26.950> you<00:05:27.040> can<00:05:27.160> clearly

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
and all this stuff but you can clearly

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.640 
and all this stuff but you can clearly
see<00:05:27.820> from<00:05:27.850> his<00:05:28.210> own<00:05:28.360> videos<00:05:28.870> over<00:05:29.260> the<00:05:29.290> period

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
see from his own videos over the period

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:32.850 
see from his own videos over the period
of<00:05:29.920> time<00:05:30.220> as<00:05:30.660> transpired<00:05:31.660> that<00:05:31.930> he<00:05:32.440> gained<00:05:32.710> a

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
of time as transpired that he gained a

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.730 
of time as transpired that he gained a
lot<00:05:33.100> of<00:05:33.160> extra<00:05:34.060> weight<00:05:34.240> and<00:05:34.540> now<00:05:34.720> he's<00:05:35.410> a<00:05:35.440> lot

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:35.740 
lot of extra weight and now he's a lot

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.190 
lot of extra weight and now he's a lot
heavier<00:05:36.160> than<00:05:36.430> he<00:05:36.580> used<00:05:36.730> to<00:05:36.910> be<00:05:36.970> so<00:05:37.960> that's<00:05:38.110> a

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:38.200 
heavier than he used to be so that's a

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.870 
heavier than he used to be so that's a
living<00:05:38.530> example<00:05:38.680> of<00:05:39.190> someone<00:05:39.460> that<00:05:39.580> it<00:05:39.760> was

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 
living example of someone that it was

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.780 
living example of someone that it was
even<00:05:40.030> health<00:05:40.450> conscious<00:05:40.990> initially<00:05:41.680> and<00:05:42.040> had

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:42.790 
even health conscious initially and had

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.660 
even health conscious initially and had
this<00:05:42.970> theory<00:05:43.930> of<00:05:44.200> his<00:05:44.410> that<00:05:45.100> raising<00:05:45.490> body

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:45.670 
this theory of his that raising body

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:47.730 
this theory of his that raising body
temperature<00:05:46.000> be<00:05:46.120> a<00:05:46.150> good<00:05:46.300> thing<00:05:46.480> so<00:05:46.740> justified

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
temperature be a good thing so justified

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.830 
temperature be a good thing so justified
his<00:05:47.890> consumption<00:05:48.370> of<00:05:48.670> eating<00:05:49.150> process<00:05:49.660> and

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 
his consumption of eating process and

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.040 
his consumption of eating process and
junk<00:05:50.050> foods<00:05:50.350> and<00:05:50.710> now<00:05:51.340> you<00:05:51.400> see<00:05:51.790> him<00:05:52.030> a<00:05:52.330> lot

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:53.050 
junk foods and now you see him a lot

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.310 
junk foods and now you see him a lot
heavier<00:05:53.520> so<00:05:54.520> if<00:05:55.240> that<00:05:55.510> is<00:05:55.630> something<00:05:55.810> that<00:05:56.080> you

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:56.320 
heavier so if that is something that you

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.890 
heavier so if that is something that you
choose<00:05:56.590> to<00:05:56.800> do<00:05:56.980> so<00:05:57.280> be<00:05:58.060> it<00:05:58.150> but<00:05:58.180> at<00:05:58.480> least<00:05:58.660> now

00:05:58.890 --> 00:05:58.900 
choose to do so be it but at least now

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.540 
choose to do so be it but at least now
you<00:05:58.960> have<00:05:59.230> the<00:05:59.350> knowledge<00:05:59.590> and<00:06:00.100> the

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
you have the knowledge and the

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.790 
you have the knowledge and the
understanding<00:06:00.580> of<00:06:01.210> what<00:06:01.450> it<00:06:01.570> takes<00:06:01.840> to<00:06:02.470> really

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 
understanding of what it takes to really

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.060 
understanding of what it takes to really
become<00:06:03.100> that
