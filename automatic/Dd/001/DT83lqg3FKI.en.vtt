00:00:00.015 --> 00:00:03.000
Very comfortable!

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Nice helicopter! You did a really good job, guys.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Now you take the controls!

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.000
Very easy.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.000
It's taking off quite fast.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Now I show you the autopilot.
Just take your hands off.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.300
I could tell him to fly to Salzburg now and he would directly go to Salzburg.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.000
Amazing!

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:13.800
One engine out – that's the training mode.
Have a look at the display: even with one engine, everything ok.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.240
You don't even notice any change.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.900
I'll show you another feature: fly into the cloud!

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.000
Then you push one button and the helicopter stabilizes itself.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.100
This can be important in bad weather conditions – one move and you are safe again.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.500
This machine is really great.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.200
A dream. Thank you very much again!
Another highlight in my short life as a helicopter pilot.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.000
Respect – you did a great job.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.500
Don't say that this is not cool!

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
That's the reason why we fly helicopters!
