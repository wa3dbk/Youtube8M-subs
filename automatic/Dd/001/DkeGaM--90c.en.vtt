two<00:00:47.160> big<00:00:47.940> flat<00:00:48.360> twists<00:00:50.780> so<00:00:51.780> I'm<00:00:51.960> just<00:00:52.170> gonna

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
two big flat twists so I'm just gonna

00:00:52.379 --> 00:01:02.510 
two big flat twists so I'm just gonna
take<00:00:52.710> them<00:00:52.860> out<00:00:59.270> okay<00:01:00.300> mmm<00:01:01.109> so<00:01:01.410> my<00:01:02.039> hair<00:01:02.250> is<00:01:02.370> out

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
take them out okay mmm so my hair is out

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.140 
take them out okay mmm so my hair is out
of<00:01:02.870> the<00:01:03.979> suits<00:01:04.979> who<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.189> suppose<00:01:05.610> is<00:01:05.880> what<00:01:05.909> it

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
of the suits who I suppose is what it

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.770 
of the suits who I suppose is what it
looks<00:01:06.299> like<00:01:06.450> now<00:01:06.720> um<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.770> I<00:01:08.510> chose<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.630> do<00:01:09.750> it

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
looks like now um and I chose to do it

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.609 
looks like now um and I chose to do it
today<00:01:10.140> because<00:01:10.350> I<00:01:10.590> knew<00:01:10.920> that<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:12.619> those

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
today because I knew that the those

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.580 
today because I knew that the those
twists<00:01:14.100> would<00:01:14.280> stretch<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:14.939> hair<00:01:15.330> out<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.810> lot

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
twists would stretch the hair out a lot

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.210 
twists would stretch the hair out a lot
so<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:16.979> would<00:01:17.100> be<00:01:17.220> easier<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:18.890> do<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:19.920> length

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
so it would be easier to do a length

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:31.250 
so it would be easier to do a length
check

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.260 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:37.700 

you

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.230 

okay<00:01:38.710> so<00:01:39.220> just<00:01:39.610> to<00:01:39.940> recap<00:01:40.270> my<00:01:41.050> hair<00:01:41.290> was<00:01:41.560> is<00:01:42.240> 11

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240

okay so just to recap my hair was is 11
inches<00:01:43.960> in<00:01:44.320> the<00:01:44.500> front<00:01:44.530> and<00:01:44.980> the<00:01:45.400> very<00:01:45.630> top<00:01:46.860> it

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
inches in the front and the very top it

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.340 
inches in the front and the very top it
is<00:01:48.520> about<00:01:48.820> 9<00:01:49.560> 3/4<00:01:50.560> on<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:52.360> sides<00:01:52.630> very<00:01:53.050> close

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
is about 9 3/4 on the sides very close

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.410 
is about 9 3/4 on the sides very close
to<00:01:53.500> 10<00:01:53.680> inches<00:01:54.010> the<00:01:55.110> back<00:01:56.110> is<00:01:56.560> 8<00:01:57.550> inches<00:01:58.120> and

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
to 10 inches the back is 8 inches and

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.960 
to 10 inches the back is 8 inches and
then<00:01:58.930> I<00:01:59.050> just<00:01:59.230> measured<00:01:59.590> the<00:01:59.860> middle<00:02:00.280> and<00:02:00.520> that

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
then I just measured the middle and that

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.920 
then I just measured the middle and that
was<00:02:01.240> 10<00:02:01.600> so<00:02:02.050> that's<00:02:02.770> good<00:02:03.160> and<00:02:03.370> I<00:02:04.270> definitely

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
was 10 so that's good and I definitely

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.710 
was 10 so that's good and I definitely
think<00:02:05.590> that<00:02:06.190> my<00:02:06.430> hair<00:02:06.610> has<00:02:06.640> grown<00:02:07.000> since<00:02:07.570> I

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
think that my hair has grown since I

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.320 
think that my hair has grown since I
trimmed<00:02:07.990> it<00:02:08.140> in<00:02:08.350> October<00:02:09.310> I<00:02:09.670> just<00:02:09.880> wish<00:02:10.060> I<00:02:10.180> had

trimmed it in October I just wish I had

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.350 
trimmed it in October I just wish I had
did<00:02:10.510> a<00:02:10.540> length<00:02:11.110> check

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
did a length check

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.180 
did a length check
like<00:02:13.360> after<00:02:13.570> I<00:02:13.840> had<00:02:14.260> trimmed<00:02:14.500> it's<00:02:14.770> like<00:02:14.950> I

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
like after I had trimmed it's like I

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.310 
like after I had trimmed it's like I
didn't<00:02:16.150> so<00:02:16.450> what<00:02:16.600> can<00:02:16.900> you<00:02:16.990> do<00:02:18.990> one<00:02:19.990> thing<00:02:20.020> that

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
hair I just kind of you know trim the

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.350 
hair I just kind of you know trim the
ends<00:02:48.040> that<00:02:48.310> need<00:02:48.610> to<00:02:48.730> be<00:02:48.760> trimmed<00:02:49.000> or<00:02:49.150> whatever

ends that need to be trimmed or whatever

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.100 
ends that need to be trimmed or whatever
so<00:02:49.989> that<00:02:50.350> as<00:02:50.590> it<00:02:50.620> grows<00:02:51.190> you<00:02:51.670> know<00:02:51.810> it'll<00:02:52.810> get

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
so that as it grows you know it'll get

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.479 
so that as it grows you know it'll get
to<00:02:53.260> that<00:02:53.410> point<00:02:53.620> where<00:02:53.860> it<00:02:53.950> looks<00:02:53.980> like<00:02:54.220> it's

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
to that point where it looks like it's

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.510 
to that point where it looks like it's
all<00:02:54.700> one<00:02:55.140> life<00:02:56.140> and<00:02:56.440> I'll<00:02:56.980> see<00:02:57.160> if<00:02:57.250> I<00:02:57.340> like<00:02:57.489> it

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520
