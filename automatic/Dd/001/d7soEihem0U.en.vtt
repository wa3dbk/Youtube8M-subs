00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.129
 popular supplement 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.469
 listen i started playing only last 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:50.920
 a week since this guy became king 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:54.250
 Well, it all started with one girl and so 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.079
 no zombies yes yes it all started zombies in 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.149
 general in my area began to appear 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:01.539
 zombies who smashed all that is possible and 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:05.710
 killed people well I decided we should kill 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:08.320
 their over lordderon reaction was such an orthosis 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.320
 you are so courageous brave handsome 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.910
 in all places but after i also added 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.370
 we must kill all the people in the city 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:18.460
 because it will not turn into a zombie soon 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:21.430
 zulor dr what i was answered 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.780
 it's wrong we part with you but 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.180
 also realized that it was too 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.350
 and came up with something else gave but yes 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.350
 exactly 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.920
 In general, then I went to Northrend for 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.280
 a sword that could kill zombies but he 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.740
 did not pay off the Urals found it now 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.640
 I will be the strongest knight in all 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.310
 azerote 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.960
 emeralds rom how about to kill 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.120
 all your friends and destroy your 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.980
 kingdom fashionable listen but after 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.680
 it is very difficult to treat you 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:56.080
 well listen but I didn't know what this 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.720
 evil talking sword and destroy my soul and 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.480
 ruin my figure well fair and 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.100
 so you further well I killed my father and 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:07.630
 destroyed his civilization 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:10.660
 to the high elves, too, just as simple as you 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.400
 could 2 all blame this talking sword in 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.260
 general then I had to return to 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.150
 nordskol after all as it turned out not a sword 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.130
 talked to me and what spirit are you 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.740
 long- dead warlock arch 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.320
 which stuck the icicles the bottom line is that 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.300
 he talked to me through the sword well 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:27.580
 clear and what did he tell you when you told him 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.810
 I found something like but come on 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.870
 get these out 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.850
 0 people well, of course, pulled well in general 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.250
 after I released him there 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.590
 our minds fused into one and I became 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.360
 lich king well or whatever wait a minute 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.320
 you just said you're not the king 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.209
 lich yes yes in general technically toasted 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.430
 the guy named ball 1 is now the lich king 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.200
 and how he became to them the girl remembers 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.470
 which I said she gathered a group 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.600
 people to storm my stronghold 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.940
 Well done, you broke through the gate 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.519
 now you just need to kill 11 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.510
 most dangerous creatures to get to 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.940
 lich king 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.910
 you eat and I'll stand for several months 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:10.660
 here in general my ex was strange it 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:15.830
 not kill yes but first I killed them all 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:17.720
 oh no I'm a seal 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:22.190
 I think I should have used this 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:24.560
 ability earlier i'm not dead yet yes 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.840
 you are kidding in general he somehow 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.030
 way out of this block of ice 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.970
 then jumped 30 meters from one 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:36.020
 hitting broke my sword and all revived where 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:38.180
 killed his guys this is absolute nonsense and 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.970
 here my moron dad did not appear and 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.920
 said lol i told you these zadroty 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.120
 shared the booty with me right over mine 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.210
 wow corpse 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:50.090
 epic crashed I will definitely take it myself 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:52.640
 so don't think i should take it because 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.790
 that i'm burning shorter that's how it ended 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:56.870
 my career as a lich king is 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.750
 senseless addition 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:02.720
 Well, of course if constantly drinking pandas 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:07.180
 make sense translated and voiced 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.180
