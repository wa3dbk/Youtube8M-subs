00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:06.390
 or the youtube race this is a small 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.030
 review of batteries psc canon for 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.080
 the 7 of the 5 of moto2 I think the 60 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.590
 of 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.590
 these batteries 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.070
 it is mainly for them to realize 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.600
 when they go to buy be careful and you 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.330
 it can be an original battery not a 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.920
 pirate 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.640
 it does not seem much difference but in 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.640
 reality the duration 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:29.570
 here on the left side we can see 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.480
 it is the original battery 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:35.390
 and a code 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:38.510
 this case says 2010 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:41.070
 with the stack of this line with the canon 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.370
 with the 7 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.370
 eleven 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.370
 it is mainly one that is a spice 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:52.329
 of differences that is the original 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.329
 the one that is not original 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.520
 and that you can only stretch it 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.039
 other the differences that you can 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.340
 find the connections in Álava 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:04.080
 raised 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.520
 that connection of the medium in original is a 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.659
 little more gray no 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:12.430
 that the battery and the pirate are 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.170
 It's a little detail, but 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.820
 and with that you can realize that no 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.970
 I am 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.840
 obviously the original lasts longer and gives you 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.840
 more life time than 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.010
 and another difference here can see 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.380
 I have two originals and a pirate in the 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.390
 part of the front there we can see a 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.010
 again the coding the 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.780
 restrictions on use 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:35.490
 to throw and everything 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.220
 very careful when buying batteries 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.020
 spout 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.020
 try to look for them where a seller 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.560
 if tea is very fuzzy 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.560
 A battery 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.609
 normal hard 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.609
 a whole day d
