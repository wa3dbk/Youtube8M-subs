00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
me about it it's not just the opening

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.859 
me about it it's not just the opening
for<00:01:34.229> the<00:01:34.320> map<00:01:34.530> which<00:01:34.829> kind<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.549> ironically<00:01:36.420> all

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
for the map which kind of ironically all

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.050 
for the map which kind of ironically all
and<00:01:37.259> on<00:01:37.409> all<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.920> cape<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.250> cowl<00:01:38.460> it<00:01:38.850> does

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
and on all the cape and cowl it does

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.490 
and on all the cape and cowl it does
look<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.299> little<00:01:39.390> bit<00:01:39.630> like<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.780> joker<00:01:40.229> smile

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
look a little bit like a joker smile

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.170 
look a little bit like a joker smile
don't<00:01:40.740> you<00:01:40.890> think<00:01:41.130> so<00:01:41.549> I<00:01:41.579> think<00:01:41.670> it's<00:01:41.909> kind<00:01:42.090> of

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
don't you think so I think it's kind of

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.789 
don't you think so I think it's kind of
interesting<00:01:42.479> that<00:01:42.840> Batman's<00:01:43.229> cape<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.680> cowl

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
interesting that Batman's cape and cowl

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.639 
interesting that Batman's cape and cowl
would<00:01:44.040> reflect<00:01:44.280> his<00:01:44.759> greatest<00:01:45.090> villain<00:01:45.570> but<00:01:46.439> i

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
would reflect his greatest villain but i

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.920 
would reflect his greatest villain but i
also<00:01:46.829> think<00:01:47.009> stands<00:01:47.430> out<00:01:47.670> are<00:01:47.909> these<00:01:48.360> eyebrow

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
also think stands out are these eyebrow

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.840 
also think stands out are these eyebrow
eyebrow<00:01:49.200> arches<00:01:50.130> that<00:01:50.159> have<00:01:50.399> been<00:01:50.549> put<00:01:50.729> in

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
eyebrow arches that have been put in

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.730 
eyebrow arches that have been put in
there<00:01:51.000> it's<00:01:51.180> like<00:01:51.299> those<00:01:51.780> fading<00:01:52.320> Hollywood

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
there it's like those fading Hollywood

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.560 
there it's like those fading Hollywood
stars<00:01:53.009> used<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.520> draw<00:01:53.700> on<00:01:53.820> their<00:01:53.970> own<00:01:54.060> eyebrows

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
stars used to draw on their own eyebrows

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.270 
stars used to draw on their own eyebrows
nowhere<00:01:55.079> near<00:01:55.320> where<00:01:55.530> their<00:01:55.649> eyebrow<00:01:55.979> should

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
nowhere near where their eyebrow should

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.980 
nowhere near where their eyebrow should
go<00:01:56.430> that's<00:01:57.000> kind<00:01:57.360> of<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.570> effect<00:01:57.869> they're

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
go that's kind of the effect they're

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.330 
go that's kind of the effect they're
putting<00:01:58.320> here<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:59.040> think<00:01:59.219> it's

putting here and I think it's

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.440

to play the Caped Crusader and it looks

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.139 
to play the Caped Crusader and it looks

into costumes apparently you're going to

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.330

and then also a furrowed brow this

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.399 
and then also a furrowed brow this
Batman's<00:02:23.700> always<00:02:24.120> angry<00:02:24.510> even<00:02:24.840> if<00:02:24.930> he's<00:02:24.989> happy

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:25.409 
Batman's always angry even if he's happy

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:26.149 
Batman's always angry even if he's happy
he<00:02:25.470> doesn't<00:02:25.680> have<00:02:25.769> to<00:02:25.890> worry<00:02:26.069> about

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:26.159 
he doesn't have to worry about

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:27.979 
he doesn't have to worry about
maintaining<00:02:26.700> that<00:02:26.970> appearance<00:02:27.510> because<00:02:27.690> this

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
maintaining that appearance because this

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.140 
maintaining that appearance because this
costume<00:02:28.379> does<00:02:28.620> it<00:02:28.769> for<00:02:29.010> it<00:02:29.159> so<00:02:29.760> i<00:02:29.790> think<00:02:29.879> that's

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
costume does it for it so i think that's

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.030 
costume does it for it so i think that's
that's<00:02:30.540> amusing<00:02:30.959> so<00:02:31.260> I<00:02:31.290> think<00:02:31.409> for<00:02:31.709> house

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
that's amusing so I think for house

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.199 
that's amusing so I think for house
while<00:02:32.250> you<00:02:32.370> might<00:02:32.489> be<00:02:32.640> seeing<00:02:32.819> here<00:02:33.090> are

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
while you might be seeing here are

while you might be seeing here are

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
making up for the deficits a Ben Affleck

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:37.970 
making up for the deficits a Ben Affleck
that<00:02:36.510> he<00:02:36.569> personally<00:02:36.810> has<00:02:37.290> to<00:02:37.470> help<00:02:37.680> me<00:02:37.799> be

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
that he personally has to help me be

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.800 
that he personally has to help me be
more<00:02:38.010> effective<00:02:38.909> playing<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.269> character<00:02:39.540> now

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
more effective playing the character now

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.839 
more effective playing the character now
I'm<00:02:40.230> rooting<00:02:40.709> for<00:02:40.739> bed<00:02:41.010> Affleck<00:02:41.370> in<00:02:41.489> this<00:02:41.640> role

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
I'm rooting for bed Affleck in this role

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.550 
I'm rooting for bed Affleck in this role
the<00:02:42.269> only<00:02:42.540> good<00:02:42.659> thing<00:02:42.720> about<00:02:42.900> runner<00:02:43.260> runner

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
the only good thing about runner runner

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.319 
the only good thing about runner runner
was<00:02:43.859> it<00:02:44.040> was<00:02:44.220> kind<00:02:44.430> of<00:02:44.459> a<00:02:44.579> sneak<00:02:44.790> peek<00:02:45.060> of<00:02:45.180> his

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
was it was kind of a sneak peek of his

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:47.509 
was it was kind of a sneak peek of his
Bruce<00:02:45.629> Wayne<00:02:45.959> I<00:02:46.260> think<00:02:47.069> he<00:02:47.190> could<00:02:47.340> very

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
Bruce Wayne I think he could very

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.520 
Bruce Wayne I think he could very
effectively<00:02:48.120> pull<00:02:48.420> that<00:02:48.569> off<00:02:48.599> but<00:02:49.170> I<00:02:49.230> still

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
effectively pull that off but I still

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.170 
effectively pull that off but I still
think<00:02:49.799> the<00:02:49.889> biggest<00:02:50.159> hope<00:02:50.549> for<00:02:50.579> him<00:02:50.849> to<00:02:51.000> jump

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
think the biggest hope for him to jump

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.910 
think the biggest hope for him to jump
through<00:02:51.389> is<00:02:51.569> going<00:02:51.780> to<00:02:51.900> be<00:02:52.019> pulling<00:02:52.260> off<00:02:52.500> the

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
through is going to be pulling off the

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.530 
through is going to be pulling off the
bat<00:02:53.190> man<00:02:53.400> persona<00:02:53.760> that's<00:02:54.030> very<00:02:54.299> interesting

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
bat man persona that's very interesting

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.930 
bat man persona that's very interesting
because<00:02:54.959> that<00:02:55.739> the<00:02:55.889> hardest<00:02:56.310> persona<00:02:56.670> to<00:02:56.790> pull

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
because that the hardest persona to pull

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.000 
because that the hardest persona to pull
off<00:02:57.060> in<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.239> past<00:02:57.450> has<00:02:57.629> been<00:02:57.659> Bruce<00:02:58.079> Wayne<00:02:58.409> but

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
off in the past has been Bruce Wayne but

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.740 
off in the past has been Bruce Wayne but
I<00:02:59.040> have<00:02:59.220> a<00:02:59.250> strong<00:02:59.639> feeling<00:02:59.700> of<00:03:00.239> Ben<00:03:00.389> Affleck's

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
I have a strong feeling of Ben Affleck's

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:01.879 
I have a strong feeling of Ben Affleck's
Bruce<00:03:00.989> way<00:03:01.230> and<00:03:01.379> it's<00:03:01.470> going<00:03:01.560> to<00:03:01.620> be<00:03:01.709> the<00:03:01.799> most

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:01.889 
Bruce way and it's going to be the most

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:04.009 
Bruce way and it's going to be the most
memorable<00:03:02.159> part<00:03:02.370> of<00:03:02.639> his<00:03:02.760> performance<00:03:03.329> but<00:03:03.959> I

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
memorable part of his performance but I

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.780 
memorable part of his performance but I
think<00:03:04.230> this<00:03:04.290> is<00:03:04.440> a<00:03:04.470> very<00:03:04.560> interesting<00:03:05.099> costume

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
think this is a very interesting costume

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.819 
think this is a very interesting costume
I'm<00:03:06.569> curious<00:03:07.019> to<00:03:07.200> see<00:03:07.319> how<00:03:07.409> it's<00:03:07.560> going<00:03:07.799> to

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
I'm curious to see how it's going to

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:09.740 
I'm curious to see how it's going to
look<00:03:07.950> and<00:03:08.280> I<00:03:08.400> think<00:03:08.639> the<00:03:08.730> evil<00:03:09.180> nature<00:03:09.389> of<00:03:09.659> the

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
look and I think the evil nature of the

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.830 
look and I think the evil nature of the
eyebrows<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:10.560> furrowed<00:03:10.950> brow<00:03:11.280> um<00:03:11.810> you<00:03:12.810> know

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
eyebrows the furrowed brow um you know

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.690 
eyebrows the furrowed brow um you know
the<00:03:12.930> bigger<00:03:13.349> eye<00:03:13.440> holes<00:03:13.889> by<00:03:14.129> the<00:03:14.190> way<00:03:14.430> the

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
the bigger eye holes by the way the

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.000 
the bigger eye holes by the way the
biggest<00:03:15.030> piece<00:03:15.180> I<00:03:15.389> think<00:03:15.629> we've<00:03:15.780> seen<00:03:16.019> I<00:03:16.260> think

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
biggest piece I think we've seen I think

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.039 
biggest piece I think we've seen I think
are<00:03:17.430> really<00:03:17.730> you<00:03:18.239> know<00:03:18.329> pointing<00:03:18.870> to<00:03:19.019> a

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
are really you know pointing to a

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:20.930 
are really you know pointing to a
different<00:03:19.500> type<00:03:19.620> of<00:03:19.650> Batman<00:03:20.190> in<00:03:20.400> addition<00:03:20.849> to

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
different type of Batman in addition to

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.580 
different type of Batman in addition to
maybe<00:03:21.090> what's<00:03:21.299> going<00:03:21.540> on<00:03:21.660> behind<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.379> scenes

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
maybe what's going on behind the scenes

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.979 
maybe what's going on behind the scenes
but<00:03:22.769> I<00:03:22.799> think<00:03:23.010> on<00:03:23.160> screen<00:03:23.639> it's<00:03:24.449> also<00:03:24.629> a<00:03:24.780> very

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
but I think on screen it's also a very

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.689 
but I think on screen it's also a very
different<00:03:25.709> look<00:03:25.829> a<00:03:25.889> little<00:03:26.160> bit<00:03:26.400> more<00:03:26.579> you

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:26.699 
different look a little bit more you

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:27.860 
different look a little bit more you
know<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:27.030> lines<00:03:27.180> I<00:03:27.389> think<00:03:27.569> are<00:03:27.690> blurred

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
know the lines I think are blurred

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.750 
know the lines I think are blurred
between<00:03:28.019> classic<00:03:28.590> hero<00:03:28.799> and<00:03:29.040> villain<00:03:29.069> and<00:03:29.489> I

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
between classic hero and villain and I

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.369 
between classic hero and villain and I
guess<00:03:30.030> at<00:03:30.060> first<00:03:30.180> that's<00:03:30.569> how<00:03:30.690> he'll<00:03:30.840> appear

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:31.379 
guess at first that's how he'll appear

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:33.979 
guess at first that's how he'll appear
to<00:03:31.859> Superman<00:03:32.340> right<00:03:32.579> Henry<00:03:33.449> Cavill<00:03:33.780> cuz<00:03:33.900> I

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
to Superman right Henry Cavill cuz I

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:34.939 
to Superman right Henry Cavill cuz I
think<00:03:34.169> he's<00:03:34.290> going<00:03:34.440> to<00:03:34.560> get<00:03:34.650> a<00:03:34.709> beat<00:03:34.919> down

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:34.949 
think he's going to get a beat down

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:37.220 
think he's going to get a beat down
before<00:03:35.730> they<00:03:35.849> have<00:03:35.970> a<00:03:36.000> heart-to-heart<00:03:36.329> so<00:03:37.139> I'm
