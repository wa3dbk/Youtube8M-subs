plugins<00:00:21.300> you<00:00:21.420> need<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:22.160> um<00:00:23.840> so<00:00:24.840> first<00:00:25.500> we're

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
plugins you need and um so first we're

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.640 
plugins you need and um so first we're
just<00:00:25.980> going<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.130> find<00:00:26.340> a<00:00:26.490> space<00:00:26.820> for<00:00:27.650> making

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
just going to find a space for making

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.259 
just going to find a space for making
the<00:00:28.890> arena<00:00:29.310> and<00:00:29.429> you<00:00:29.519> can<00:00:29.640> skip<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:29.970> little

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
the arena and you can skip a little

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.569 
the arena and you can skip a little
because<00:00:30.390> uh<00:00:30.779> I<00:00:31.769> don't<00:00:31.980> think<00:00:32.189> I'm<00:00:32.430> going<00:00:32.520> to

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
because uh I don't think I'm going to

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.600 
because uh I don't think I'm going to
find<00:00:32.790> it<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:33.090> easily<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.870> i<00:00:34.710> probably<00:00:35.160> won't

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
find it that easily and i probably won't

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.690 
find it that easily and i probably won't
so<00:00:36.360> you<00:00:36.450> can<00:00:36.630> skip<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:36.989> little<00:00:37.290> if<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.559> want<00:00:37.700> but
