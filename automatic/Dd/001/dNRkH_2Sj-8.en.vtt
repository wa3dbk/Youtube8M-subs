native mod and because if you watch me
other<00:01:32.790> couple<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.329> videos<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.780> modern<00:01:34.020> warfare

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170

other couple of videos of modern warfare
3<00:01:34.350> i've<00:01:35.189> been<00:01:36.180> told<00:01:36.390> or<00:01:36.570> it's<00:01:36.689> been<00:01:36.810> written

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
3 i've been told or it's been written

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.460 
3 i've been told or it's been written
basically<00:01:38.009> if<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.310> don't<00:01:38.490> use<00:01:38.700> native<00:01:39.470> it

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
basically if you don't use native it

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.359 
basically if you don't use native it
will<00:01:40.619> use<00:01:41.150> the<00:01:42.150> xbox<00:01:42.390> 360<00:01:43.049> or<00:01:43.380> ps3<00:01:43.680> s<00:01:44.070> and

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
will use the xbox 360 or ps3 s and

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.490 
will use the xbox 360 or ps3 s and
graphics<00:01:45.210> which<00:01:45.479> is<00:01:45.630> about<00:01:45.840> it<00:01:46.020> i<00:01:46.170> think<00:01:46.380> it's

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
graphics which is about it i think it's

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.649 
graphics which is about it i think it's
about<00:01:46.560> 800<00:01:47.100> x<00:01:47.220> 600<00:01:47.579> I<00:01:47.939> think<00:01:48.119> it's<00:01:48.270> saying<00:01:48.509> it

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
about 800 x 600 I think it's saying it

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.620 
about 800 x 600 I think it's saying it
is<00:01:48.750> or<00:01:48.930> 1024<00:01:49.560> x<00:01:49.740> 768<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:50.610> then<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:51.450> basically

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
is or 1024 x 768 and then it basically

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.260 
is or 1024 x 768 and then it basically
expanders<00:01:52.470> that<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.890> be<00:01:52.979> able<00:01:53.070> to

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
expanders that to be able to

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.830 
expanders that to be able to
to<00:01:55.229> fit<00:01:55.439> on<00:01:55.560> your<00:01:55.710> your<00:01:56.310> your<00:01:56.700> resolution<00:01:57.299> of

to fit on your your your resolution of
choice<00:01:58.079> minds<00:01:58.350> 1440<00:01:59.280> x<00:01:59.429> 900<00:02:00.649> see<00:02:01.649> your<00:02:01.770> pic

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
choice minds 1440 x 900 see your pic

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.020 
choice minds 1440 x 900 see your pic
narrative<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.520> then<00:02:02.610> you<00:02:02.729> can<00:02:02.880> mess<00:02:03.000> around

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
narrative and then you can mess around

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.109 
narrative and then you can mess around
so<00:02:03.630> i<00:02:03.659> basically<00:02:03.840> just<00:02:04.189> don't<00:02:05.189> pick<00:02:05.399> extra<00:02:05.850> as

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
so i basically just don't pick extra as

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.429 
so i basically just don't pick extra as
it<00:02:06.270> used<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.509> be<00:02:06.630> with<00:02:06.750> all<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:06.990> other<00:02:07.110> call<00:02:07.289> of

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
it used to be with all the other call of

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.740 
it used to be with all the other call of
duty<00:02:07.740> games<00:02:07.950> graphics<00:02:08.819> graphics<00:02:09.330> are<00:02:09.629> really

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
duty games graphics graphics are really

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.539 
duty games graphics graphics are really
nice<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.349> they<00:02:10.739> look<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:10.950> little<00:02:11.039> bit<00:02:11.220> crisper

00:02:11.539 --> 00:02:11.549 
nice and they look a little bit crisper

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:15.289 
nice and they look a little bit crisper
and<00:02:11.720> the<00:02:12.720> being<00:02:13.680> honest<00:02:13.950> that<00:02:13.980> it<00:02:14.849> feels<00:02:15.090> like

00:02:15.289 --> 00:02:15.299 
and the being honest that it feels like

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:18.710 
and the being honest that it feels like
modern<00:02:15.599> warfare<00:02:15.750> 2<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:17.220> it<00:02:17.760> i<00:02:18.030> wouldn't<00:02:18.510> say

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
modern warfare 2 and it i wouldn't say

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.000 
modern warfare 2 and it i wouldn't say
it's<00:02:18.840> an<00:02:18.930> expansion<00:02:19.440> i've<00:02:19.530> read<00:02:19.680> somewhere

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
it's an expansion i've read somewhere

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.880 
it's an expansion i've read somewhere
that<00:02:20.480> that<00:02:21.480> some<00:02:21.930> some<00:02:22.410> people<00:02:22.709> feel<00:02:22.860> that

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
that that some some people feel that

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.949 
that that some some people feel that
it's<00:02:23.220> an<00:02:23.310> expansion<00:02:23.849> and<00:02:24.090> to<00:02:24.540> modern<00:02:24.780> warfare

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
it's an expansion and to modern warfare

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.559 
it's an expansion and to modern warfare
2<00:02:26.690> no<00:02:27.690> I<00:02:27.720> think<00:02:28.019> it's<00:02:28.260> again<00:02:28.470> it's<00:02:28.650> alright<00:02:29.040> and

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
2 no I think it's again it's alright and

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.030 
2 no I think it's again it's alright and
but<00:02:30.569> it's<00:02:30.720> it's<00:02:31.079> building<00:02:31.440> on<00:02:31.560> those<00:02:31.709> blocks

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
but it's it's building on those blocks

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.089 
but it's it's building on those blocks
and<00:02:32.310> if<00:02:32.819> you<00:02:32.940> see<00:02:33.060> what<00:02:33.180> I<00:02:33.209> mean<00:02:33.360> and<00:02:33.829> so<00:02:34.829> it

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
and if you see what I mean and so it

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:36.740 
and if you see what I mean and so it
looks<00:02:35.459> a<00:02:35.579> little<00:02:35.700> bit<00:02:35.910> cleaner<00:02:36.209> everything

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
looks a little bit cleaner everything

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.870 
looks a little bit cleaner everything
looks<00:02:36.900> a<00:02:36.989> little<00:02:37.110> bit<00:02:37.319> tighter<00:02:37.560> than<00:02:38.549> the

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
looks a little bit tighter than the

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.660 
looks a little bit tighter than the
graphics<00:02:39.269> feel<00:02:39.450> good<00:02:39.630> the<00:02:40.380> weapons<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:41.040> 2

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
graphics feel good the weapons the 2

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.559 
graphics feel good the weapons the 2
i've<00:02:41.819> used<00:02:42.060> and<00:02:42.420> feel<00:02:42.780> really<00:02:43.530> really<00:02:43.650> good<00:02:43.769> i

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
i've used and feel really really good i

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.199 
i've used and feel really really good i
got<00:02:45.569> a<00:02:45.599> little<00:02:45.630> bit<00:02:45.930> of<00:02:45.959> recoil<00:02:46.470> bit<00:02:46.739> kick<00:02:47.209> and

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
got a little bit of recoil bit kick and

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.300 
got a little bit of recoil bit kick and
but<00:02:48.660> nothing<00:02:49.170> quite<00:02:49.260> as<00:02:49.380> severe<00:02:49.680> as<00:02:49.799> black<00:02:50.069> ops

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
but nothing quite as severe as black ops

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.180 
but nothing quite as severe as black ops
so<00:02:50.549> it<00:02:50.670> feels<00:02:50.819> quite<00:02:51.120> natural<00:02:51.540> and<00:02:52.010> that<00:02:53.010> none

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
so it feels quite natural and that none

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.640 
so it feels quite natural and that none
of<00:02:53.220> them<00:02:53.400> feel<00:02:53.549> like<00:02:53.760> rail<00:02:54.090> guns<00:02:54.379> as<00:02:55.379> i<00:02:55.500> say

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
of them feel like rail guns as i say

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.740 
of them feel like rail guns as i say
i've<00:02:55.769> only<00:02:55.920> played<00:02:56.160> three<00:02:56.790> games<00:02:56.819> and<00:02:57.299> so<00:02:57.660> I've

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
i've only played three games and so I've

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.229 
i've only played three games and so I've
got<00:02:57.900> limited<00:02:58.200> experience<00:02:58.970> but<00:02:59.970> none<00:03:00.090> of<00:03:00.120> them

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
got limited experience but none of them

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.020 
got limited experience but none of them
feel<00:03:00.450> like<00:03:00.630> real<00:03:00.810> rail<00:03:01.139> guns<00:03:01.549> like<00:03:02.549> the<00:03:02.670> ACR

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
feel like real rail guns like the ACR

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.479 
feel like real rail guns like the ACR
I've<00:03:03.690> just<00:03:03.870> unlocked<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.260> sky<00:03:04.530> so<00:03:04.950> I<00:03:04.980> might<00:03:05.340> be

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
I've just unlocked the sky so I might be

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.520 
I've just unlocked the sky so I might be
using<00:03:05.760> that<00:03:05.880> as<00:03:06.000> well<00:03:06.150> but<00:03:06.989> I<00:03:07.079> did<00:03:07.200> like<00:03:07.350> the

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
using that as well but I did like the

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.509 
using that as well but I did like the
the<00:03:08.540> m4a1<00:03:09.540> in<00:03:09.840> modern<00:03:10.530> warfare<00:03:10.560> 2<00:03:10.950> it<00:03:11.220> was<00:03:11.340> kind

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
the m4a1 in modern warfare 2 it was kind

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.599 
the m4a1 in modern warfare 2 it was kind
of<00:03:11.609> like<00:03:11.700> the<00:03:11.880> alternative<00:03:12.389> to<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:12.630> ACR<00:03:13.220> so<00:03:14.220> I

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:14.609 
of like the alternative to the ACR so I

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:16.580 
of like the alternative to the ACR so I
can't<00:03:15.389> remember<00:03:15.630> what<00:03:15.720> I<00:03:15.810> do<00:03:15.870> but<00:03:16.170> I'm<00:03:16.319> going

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
can't remember what I do but I'm going

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.590 
can't remember what I do but I'm going
to<00:03:16.650> change<00:03:16.859> if<00:03:17.700> you're<00:03:17.819> just<00:03:17.970> what<00:03:18.239> you<00:03:18.450> can

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
to change if you're just what you can

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.090 
to change if you're just what you can
see<00:03:18.750> there's<00:03:18.930> a<00:03:18.989> little<00:03:19.019> bit<00:03:19.290> of<00:03:19.350> kick<00:03:19.590> up<00:03:19.769> I'm

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
see there's a little bit of kick up I'm

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.920 
see there's a little bit of kick up I'm
not<00:03:20.489> an<00:03:20.700> expert<00:03:20.970> enough<00:03:21.299> to<00:03:21.510> be<00:03:21.600> able<00:03:21.660> to<00:03:21.780> tell

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
not an expert enough to be able to tell

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.539 
not an expert enough to be able to tell
if<00:03:21.959> it's<00:03:22.200> kicking<00:03:22.500> left<00:03:22.709> off<00:03:22.950> down<00:03:23.250> whatever

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
if it's kicking left off down whatever

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.580 
if it's kicking left off down whatever
you<00:03:24.239> can<00:03:24.359> see<00:03:24.510> it's<00:03:24.660> moving<00:03:24.930> a<00:03:25.019> little<00:03:25.170> bit<00:03:25.260> and

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
you can see it's moving a little bit and

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.349 
you can see it's moving a little bit and
so<00:03:26.099> you<00:03:26.220> know<00:03:26.489> you<00:03:26.609> do<00:03:26.819> have<00:03:26.849> to<00:03:27.090> make<00:03:27.120> your

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
so you know you do have to make your

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:29.780 
so you know you do have to make your
shots<00:03:27.540> to<00:03:27.780> be<00:03:27.870> honest<00:03:28.109> the<00:03:29.010> seller<00:03:29.220> graphics<00:03:29.579> a

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
shots to be honest the seller graphics a

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.789 
shots to be honest the seller graphics a
little<00:03:30.329> bit<00:03:30.450> better<00:03:30.599> and<00:03:31.139> the<00:03:31.470> modern<00:03:31.709> warfare

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
little bit better and the modern warfare

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.250 
little bit better and the modern warfare
2<00:03:32.220> just<00:03:32.519> a<00:03:32.579> little<00:03:32.730> bit<00:03:32.819> cleaner<00:03:33.090> but<00:03:33.989> I

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
2 just a little bit cleaner but I

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.520 
2 just a little bit cleaner but I
everything<00:03:34.560> looks<00:03:34.829> a<00:03:34.889> little<00:03:35.010> bit<00:03:35.250> tighter

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
everything looks a little bit tighter

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.730 
everything looks a little bit tighter
and<00:03:37.490> the<00:03:38.480> maps<00:03:38.690> i<00:03:39.020> think<00:03:39.500> i've<00:03:39.560> only<00:03:39.680> played

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:39.740 
and the maps i think i've only played

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.559 
and the maps i think i've only played
about<00:03:39.920> three<00:03:40.250> maps<00:03:40.490> quite<00:03:40.850> like<00:03:41.030> this<00:03:41.150> one<00:03:41.209> as

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:41.569 
about three maps quite like this one as

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:43.090 
about three maps quite like this one as
I<00:03:41.690> said<00:03:41.750> the<00:03:41.990> first<00:03:42.020> time<00:03:42.500> I<00:03:42.530> want<00:03:42.740> to<00:03:42.800> put<00:03:42.920> up

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
I said the first time I want to put up

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.400 
I said the first time I want to put up
plate<00:03:43.340> it<00:03:43.490> though<00:03:43.640> but<00:03:44.569> I<00:03:44.630> do<00:03:44.720> like<00:03:44.900> this<00:03:45.080> one<00:03:45.260> I

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
plate it though but I do like this one I

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.730 
plate it though but I do like this one I
like<00:03:45.890> the<00:03:46.040> core<00:03:46.190> Scott<00:03:46.490> courts<00:03:47.030> close

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.740 
like the core Scott courts close

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.540 
like the core Scott courts close
quarters<00:03:48.740> and<00:03:49.540> combat<00:03:50.540> then<00:03:50.750> it<00:03:51.200> seems<00:03:51.709> quite

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550 
quarters and combat then it seems quite

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:53.800 
quarters and combat then it seems quite
good<00:03:52.700> i<00:03:52.730> played<00:03:52.970> another<00:03:53.209> one<00:03:53.360> earlier<00:03:53.630> on<00:03:53.720> the

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
good i played another one earlier on the

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.240 
good i played another one earlier on the
Conn<00:03:53.959> tell<00:03:54.140> you<00:03:54.200> what<00:03:54.350> it<00:03:54.440> was<00:03:54.470> but<00:03:54.830> there<00:03:55.100> seem

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
Conn tell you what it was but there seem

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.309 
Conn tell you what it was but there seem
to<00:03:55.280> be<00:03:55.400> like<00:03:55.730> multiple<00:03:56.150> entrances<00:03:56.780> you<00:03:57.230> know

00:03:57.309 --> 00:03:57.319 
to be like multiple entrances you know

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:58.809 
to be like multiple entrances you know
those<00:03:57.500> escalators<00:03:57.680> all<00:03:58.130> over<00:03:58.340> the<00:03:58.430> place<00:03:58.610> and

00:03:58.809 --> 00:03:58.819 
those escalators all over the place and

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:00.100 
those escalators all over the place and
obviously<00:03:59.090> the<00:03:59.239> learning<00:03:59.510> curve<00:03:59.660> I<00:03:59.870> haven't

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:00.110 
obviously the learning curve I haven't

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.809 
obviously the learning curve I haven't
learned<00:04:00.290> it<00:04:00.500> I<00:04:00.830> was<00:04:01.250> getting<00:04:01.459> jumped<00:04:01.760> from

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:01.819 
learned it I was getting jumped from

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:03.309 
learned it I was getting jumped from
behind<00:04:01.970> and<00:04:02.390> things<00:04:02.660> where<00:04:02.870> is<00:04:02.959> this<00:04:03.050> I

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319 
behind and things where is this I

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:05.309 
behind and things where is this I
wouldn't<00:04:04.130> like<00:04:04.280> to<00:04:04.310> say<00:04:04.459> it's<00:04:04.610> linear<00:04:04.940> and

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
wouldn't like to say it's linear and

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.170 
wouldn't like to say it's linear and
it's<00:04:06.319> a<00:04:06.500> natural<00:04:06.709> feel<00:04:07.190> I<00:04:07.459> don't<00:04:08.030> know<00:04:08.120> if

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
it's a natural feel I don't know if

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.370 
it's a natural feel I don't know if
that's<00:04:08.390> because<00:04:08.450> it's<00:04:08.870> an<00:04:08.989> urban<00:04:09.320> environment

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
that's because it's an urban environment

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.310 
that's because it's an urban environment
but<00:04:09.980> if<00:04:10.220> you<00:04:10.670> know<00:04:10.760> it's<00:04:10.910> natural<00:04:11.360> you<00:04:11.390> seem<00:04:12.170> to

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:12.320 
but if you know it's natural you seem to

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.110 
but if you know it's natural you seem to
be<00:04:12.410> looking<00:04:12.530> for<00:04:12.890> cover<00:04:13.070> and<00:04:13.280> things<00:04:13.519> the

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
be looking for cover and things the

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.430 
be looking for cover and things the
other<00:04:14.239> thing<00:04:14.420> is<00:04:14.540> it's<00:04:14.780> quite<00:04:14.959> bright<00:04:15.170> and

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
other thing is it's quite bright and

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.390 
other thing is it's quite bright and
that<00:04:16.100> the<00:04:16.700> brightness<00:04:17.090> levels<00:04:17.450> own<00:04:18.400> default

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
that the brightness levels own default

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.360 
that the brightness levels own default
I've<00:04:19.669> not<00:04:19.850> touched<00:04:20.000> anything<00:04:20.359> there<00:04:21.370> and

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
I've not touched anything there and

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.880 
I've not touched anything there and
everything<00:04:22.669> looks<00:04:22.970> nice<00:04:23.720> and<00:04:23.990> clear<00:04:24.650> and

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:24.890 
everything looks nice and clear and

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:29.860 
everything looks nice and clear and
clean<00:04:25.130> and<00:04:25.340> I<00:04:26.560> can<00:04:27.560> tell<00:04:27.830> who's<00:04:28.760> hope<00:04:29.030> whether

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
clean and I can tell who's hope whether

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.810 
clean and I can tell who's hope whether
that's<00:04:29.990> just<00:04:30.260> because<00:04:30.380> of<00:04:30.590> that<00:04:30.620> map<00:04:30.890> I<00:04:31.220> was

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
that's just because of that map I was

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.100 
that's just because of that map I was
playing<00:04:32.000> on<00:04:32.150> up<00:04:32.270> earlier<00:04:32.600> on<00:04:32.720> I<00:04:32.750> think<00:04:32.900> we're

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
playing on up earlier on I think we're

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.659 
playing on up earlier on I think we're
all<00:04:33.260> the<00:04:33.380> SAS<00:04:33.830> or<00:04:34.010> something<00:04:34.340> like<00:04:34.430> that<00:04:34.490> so

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:34.669 
all the SAS or something like that so

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:36.280 
all the SAS or something like that so
we're<00:04:34.790> all<00:04:34.910> special<00:04:35.150> forces<00:04:35.570> in<00:04:35.810> that<00:04:35.930> Ackman

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
we're all special forces in that Ackman

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:39.790 
we're all special forces in that Ackman
tell<00:04:36.560> me<00:04:37.310> from<00:04:37.520> anybody<00:04:37.760> else<00:04:37.940> I<00:04:38.710> think<00:04:39.710> the

remember<00:04:54.590> what<00:04:54.770> the<00:04:54.890> other<00:04:55.010> one<00:04:55.130> is

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
remember what the other one is

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.800 
remember what the other one is
it<00:04:57.250> was<00:04:57.400> the<00:04:57.670> more<00:04:57.820> useful<00:04:58.240> of<00:04:58.360> the<00:04:58.480> two<00:04:58.660> that

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
it was the more useful of the two that

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.340 
it was the more useful of the two that
I'd<00:04:58.930> choices<00:04:59.440> for<00:05:00.240> there's<00:05:01.240> multiple<00:05:01.720> like

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350 
I'd choices for there's multiple like

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:04.110 
I'd choices for there's multiple like
the<00:05:02.560> killstreaks<00:05:02.980> you<00:05:03.130> can<00:05:03.280> see<00:05:03.400> then<00:05:03.550> I<00:05:03.640> think

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
the killstreaks you can see then I think

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.280 
the killstreaks you can see then I think
they're<00:05:04.240> not<00:05:04.330> cold<00:05:04.570> killstreaks<00:05:05.050> and<00:05:05.230> I

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290 
they're not cold killstreaks and I

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:06.570 
they're not cold killstreaks and I
called<00:05:05.470> point<00:05:05.680> streaks<00:05:06.010> only<00:05:06.280> everybody

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
called point streaks only everybody

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.500 
called point streaks only everybody
knows<00:05:06.760> that<00:05:07.200> I<00:05:08.550> think<00:05:09.550> I've<00:05:09.640> had<00:05:09.730> eight<00:05:09.910> UAVs

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
knows that I think I've had eight UAVs

applied the first game she watched about
my<00:05:23.650> video<00:05:24.000> it<00:05:25.000> was<00:05:25.120> extremely<00:05:25.480> laggy<00:05:25.750> thought

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
my video it was extremely laggy thought

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.370 
my video it was extremely laggy thought
that<00:05:26.650> was<00:05:26.770> initially<00:05:27.160> down<00:05:27.310> to<00:05:27.490> connection

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 
with cable the same pretty much the same

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:48.810 
with cable the same pretty much the same
you<00:05:46.570> know<00:05:46.890> network<00:05:47.890> for<00:05:48.190> the<00:05:48.250> last<00:05:48.400> 12<00:05:48.670> years

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:48.820 
you know network for the last 12 years

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.600 
you know network for the last 12 years
basically<00:05:49.180> and<00:05:49.660> it's<00:05:50.440> always<00:05:51.070> served<00:05:51.370> me<00:05:51.490> well

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
basically and it's always served me well

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.570 
basically and it's always served me well
so<00:05:51.850> I<00:05:52.810> initially<00:05:53.320> thought<00:05:53.350> it<00:05:53.620> was<00:05:53.740> just

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:54.580 
so I initially thought it was just

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:55.980 
so I initially thought it was just
because<00:05:54.670> the<00:05:54.880> games<00:05:55.060> brand<00:05:55.360> new<00:05:55.540> you<00:05:55.840> know<00:05:55.960> I

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:55.990 
because the games brand new you know I

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:59.370 
because the games brand new you know I
settling<00:05:56.740> in<00:05:56.860> period<00:05:56.890> in<00:05:57.310> etc<00:05:57.460> etc<00:05:58.380> anyway

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380 
settling in period in etc etc anyway

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:00.570 
settling in period in etc etc anyway
since<00:05:59.590> then<00:05:59.800> obviously<00:05:59.950> I've<00:06:00.190> had<00:06:00.280> a<00:06:00.310> bit<00:06:00.430> of<00:06:00.490> a

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:00.580 
since then obviously I've had a bit of a

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.970 
since then obviously I've had a bit of a
tweak<00:06:00.850> a<00:06:01.090> look<00:06:01.660> around<00:06:01.780> at<00:06:02.050> the<00:06:02.170> config<00:06:02.770> file

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:02.980 
tweak a look around at the config file

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.400 
tweak a look around at the config file
and<00:06:03.850> I<00:06:04.030> was<00:06:04.150> pleased<00:06:04.420> to<00:06:04.480> note<00:06:04.690> that<00:06:04.720> some<00:06:05.290> of

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:05.410 
and I was pleased to note that some of

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:07.770 
and I was pleased to note that some of
the<00:06:05.580> most<00:06:06.580> of<00:06:06.760> the<00:06:06.850> config<00:06:07.180> file<00:06:07.360> was<00:06:07.510> the<00:06:07.600> same

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:07.780 
the most of the config file was the same

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.600 
the most of the config file was the same
as<00:06:07.810> modern<00:06:08.110> warfare<00:06:08.260> 2<00:06:08.620> so<00:06:09.280> there's<00:06:09.430> a<00:06:09.490> couple

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:09.610 
as modern warfare 2 so there's a couple

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.940 
as modern warfare 2 so there's a couple
of<00:06:09.790> tweaks<00:06:09.970> if<00:06:10.510> you<00:06:10.600> watch<00:06:10.750> video<00:06:11.470> number<00:06:11.650> two

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:11.950 
of tweaks if you watch video number two

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:15.770 
of tweaks if you watch video number two
I<00:06:11.980> think<00:06:12.130> is<00:06:12.430> model<00:06:13.270> more<00:06:13.390> for<00:06:13.950> my<00:06:14.950> second<00:06:15.250> game

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780 
I think is model more for my second game

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.700 
I think is model more for my second game
there's<00:06:16.780> a<00:06:16.840> couple<00:06:16.930> tweaks<00:06:17.230> in<00:06:17.380> there<00:06:17.530> for<00:06:17.650> you

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:17.710

native<00:06:26.890> resolution<00:06:27.070> it's<00:06:27.730> going<00:06:27.970> to<00:06:28.060> pretty

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:28.270 
native resolution it's going to pretty

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:30.750 
native resolution it's going to pretty
much<00:06:28.420> sized<00:06:29.100> graphics<00:06:30.100> setting<00:06:30.400> i<00:06:30.520> think<00:06:30.700> i

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:30.760 
much sized graphics setting i think i

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.060 
much sized graphics setting i think i
turn<00:06:30.940> off<00:06:31.090> shadows<00:06:31.650> that's<00:06:32.650> just<00:06:32.770> to<00:06:32.890> have<00:06:33.040> it

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:33.070 
turn off shadows that's just to have it

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:36.030 
turn off shadows that's just to have it
I've<00:06:33.340> always<00:06:33.550> turned<00:06:33.880> off<00:06:34.030> shadows<00:06:34.470> I<00:06:35.470> don't

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:36.040 
I've always turned off shadows I don't

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.170 
I've always turned off shadows I don't
think<00:06:36.220> I've<00:06:36.340> needed<00:06:36.580> and<00:06:36.820> I<00:06:36.850> don't<00:06:37.030> really

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:37.180 
think I've needed and I don't really

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:38.940 
think I've needed and I don't really
benefit<00:06:37.720> from<00:06:37.750> to<00:06:38.200> be<00:06:38.290> honest<00:06:38.530> and<00:06:38.620> it's<00:06:38.740> just

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:38.950 
benefit from to be honest and it's just

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:41.370 
benefit from to be honest and it's just
more<00:06:39.460> things<00:06:39.700> that<00:06:39.790> need<00:06:39.970> pros<00:06:40.180> I<00:06:40.360> think<00:06:40.570> so

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:41.380 
more things that need pros I think so

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:42.630 
more things that need pros I think so
that's<00:06:41.620> obviously<00:06:41.740> open<00:06:42.160> connection<00:06:42.550> a

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:42.640 
that's obviously open connection a

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:45.120 
that's obviously open connection a
little<00:06:42.880> bit<00:06:43.000> but<00:06:43.600> the<00:06:43.690> ati<00:06:43.900> tweak<00:06:44.260> and<00:06:44.470> has

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:45.130 
little bit but the ati tweak and has

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:46.950 
little bit but the ati tweak and has
definitely<00:06:45.400> helped<00:06:45.820> i<00:06:46.150> did<00:06:46.330> test<00:06:46.540> that<00:06:46.720> and

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:46.960 
definitely helped i did test that and

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.780 
definitely helped i did test that and
singly<00:06:47.710> if<00:06:47.890> you<00:06:48.010> sort<00:06:48.190> of<00:06:48.280> mean<00:06:48.400> and<00:06:48.430> then<00:06:48.610> went

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:48.790 
singly if you sort of mean and then went

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:52.080 
singly if you sort of mean and then went
back<00:06:48.820> and<00:06:49.720> set<00:06:50.320> some<00:06:50.440> other<00:06:50.590> things

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:52.090 
back and set some other things

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:54.779 
back and set some other things
to<00:06:53.090> the<00:06:53.180> game<00:06:53.330> if<00:06:53.599> it<00:06:53.720> feels<00:06:53.960> really<00:06:54.169> good<00:06:54.259> and
