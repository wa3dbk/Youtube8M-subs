some<00:00:46.620> contour<00:00:47.070> and<00:00:47.850> even<00:00:48.120> allow<00:00:48.329> some<00:00:48.570> trees

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
some contour and even allow some trees

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.990 
some contour and even allow some trees
to<00:00:48.960> take<00:00:48.989> root<00:00:49.350> so<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.550> have<00:00:50.670> what<00:00:50.789> looks<00:00:50.820> like

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
to take root so you have what looks like

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059
