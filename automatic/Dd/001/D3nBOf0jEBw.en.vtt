00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.980
 To the galley, it's all dirty then. 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.010
 coming back here with another box on the channel 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.950
 I recently made a mouse box 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.400
 reiser bamba and mauro ask kings 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.490
 control is constant and now 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.210
 make a keyboard box now in 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.350
 nasturtium 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:29.519
 So, come on, it 's good to see here and here. 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.830
 focus on the crusher box in that look 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:37.460
 so our box already calls attention 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:50.879
 and here you have to open this side here tá 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:01:01.800
 the week after the training one week the 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:01:14.490
 mouse and keyboard mouse and keyboard will 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:16.610
 of power with fado today a little more 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.610
 pulled 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.950
 I decided to start with the mouse keyboard 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.080
 urges that people who already have a 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.330
 great improvement in gameplay will not 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.850
 change game improvement I can play 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:43.600
 but now in the gameplay several times 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:47.170
 I'm playing the mausa instead of the failed 11 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:51.970
 so here you are going to give me control 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:54.570
 well then here in with glass 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.570
 plastics 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.690
 it lights up and it looks cool the shift 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.790
 great if I was really wanting that the 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.860
 hauschild keyboard is small 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.149
 I'm here with a little finger tight 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.940
 difficult and I know it will be much better 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:14.910
 to play whatever anyone needs 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:23.350
 press the shift that has a usb input 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:31.920
 and microphone input but another 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:31.920
 thing here knowing here in a single sun 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:03:33.360
 it's there main and the canal 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:41.250
 the new old version 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.380
 this new west keyboard is more 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.190
 than the current mouse is 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:53.610
 so that it was being released after 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:57.090
 o the reilly cosa mirro it the difference 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:59.700
 one of the things this one is silly 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:03.330
 cracked nelly tries the magician's account 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.739
 cracked and another one is brighter, right? 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.100
 brightness is greater 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:10.110
 I preferred this one, it's easier to find 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.300
 the same as that is because he thing 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:16.109
 normal but I preferred to thank here 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:17.609
 even in the box that has here Portuguese 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:26.700
 in this endeavor of this version in 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:31.290
 Portuguese 10 appear on tv 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:35.340

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:37.500

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:40.710
 sliding backlight with option of 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:44.570
 keystrokes ws do not give 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.570
