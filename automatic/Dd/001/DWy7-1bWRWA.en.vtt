00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
outside the fence over there we doubled

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.360 
outside the fence over there we doubled
back<00:01:25.220> on<00:01:25.460> ourselves<00:01:25.610> yet<00:01:26.380> go<00:01:27.380> to<00:01:27.440> the<00:01:27.800> edge<00:01:28.160> of

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.370 
back on ourselves yet go to the edge of

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.830 
back on ourselves yet go to the edge of
the<00:01:28.430> rock<00:01:28.610> and<00:01:28.850> so<00:01:29.000> you<00:01:29.090> got<00:01:29.210> the<00:01:29.330> warning<00:01:31.840> and

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
the rock and so you got the warning and

the rock and so you got the warning and
then<00:01:33.020> you<00:01:33.110> dropped<00:01:33.350> down<00:01:33.560> and<00:01:34.810> around<00:01:35.810> this

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.080 
then you dropped down and around this

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.660 
then you dropped down and around this
rock<00:01:36.350> would<00:01:36.710> come<00:01:36.890> back<00:01:37.010> in<00:01:37.250> towards<00:01:37.640> them<00:01:37.729> up

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
rock would come back in towards them up

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.859 
rock would come back in towards them up
and<00:01:40.670> then<00:01:40.850> we<00:01:40.940> just<00:01:40.970> keep<00:01:41.270> walking<00:01:41.479> all<00:01:41.810> the

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
and then we just keep walking all the

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:50.420 
and then we just keep walking all the
way<00:01:41.960> up<00:01:42.140> in<00:01:42.290> a<00:01:42.380> straight<00:01:42.619> line

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.830 

all<00:01:51.430> the<00:01:51.520> way<00:01:51.640> up<00:01:51.730> back<00:01:52.060> to<00:01:52.300> where<00:01:52.450> we<00:01:52.570> got<00:01:52.690> up

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
all the way up back to where we got up

00:01:52.840 --> 00:02:04.000 
all the way up back to where we got up
on<00:01:53.020> the<00:01:53.350> rock<00:01:55.380> back<00:01:56.380> to<00:01:56.620> here

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010

seeing all these fucking trees in a way
follow<00:02:26.360> this<00:02:26.540> line<00:02:27.100> across<00:02:28.100> and<00:02:29.030> see<00:02:29.210> you<00:02:29.300> get

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
follow this line across and see you get

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.710 
follow this line across and see you get
to<00:02:29.630> the<00:02:29.780> corner<00:02:30.260> and<00:02:31.480> then<00:02:32.860> it's<00:02:33.860> this<00:02:34.160> rock

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
to the corner and then it's this rock

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.250 
to the corner and then it's this rock
you've<00:02:35.720> got<00:02:35.930> a<00:02:35.960> sprint<00:02:36.350> from<00:02:37.250> the<00:02:37.430> corner

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
you've got a sprint from the corner

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.910 
you've got a sprint from the corner
around<00:02:39.260> this<00:02:39.800> rock<00:02:40.480> drop<00:02:41.480> down<00:02:41.780> and<00:02:42.110> then<00:02:42.680> in<00:02:42.890> a

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
around this rock drop down and then in a

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.820 
around this rock drop down and then in a
straight<00:02:43.220> line<00:02:44.110> see<00:02:45.110> if<00:02:45.170> we<00:02:45.260> can<00:02:45.350> do<00:02:45.470> this<00:02:45.620> no

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
straight line see if we can do this no

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.830 
straight line see if we can do this no
first<00:02:46.100> time<00:02:46.280> this<00:02:46.520> is<00:02:46.700> tricky<00:02:47.090> because<00:02:47.450> if<00:02:47.720> you

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
first time this is tricky because if you

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.350 
first time this is tricky because if you
don't<00:02:48.230> hit<00:02:48.530> it<00:02:48.710> at<00:02:49.370> speed<00:02:49.870> you<00:02:50.870> will<00:02:51.110> die<00:02:51.440> right

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
don't hit it at speed you will die right

00:02:52.360 --> 00:03:00.630 
don't hit it at speed you will die right
so<00:02:53.360> what<00:02:53.510> I<00:02:53.540> tend<00:02:53.870> to<00:02:53.930> do<00:02:54.140> is

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.240 

go<00:03:01.210> wait<00:03:01.450> and<00:03:01.630> see<00:03:01.780> the<00:03:01.900> clear<00:03:02.110> in<00:03:02.350> which<00:03:03.100> is

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
go wait and see the clear in which is

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.860 
go wait and see the clear in which is
there<00:03:04.830> the<00:03:05.830> rock<00:03:06.040> is<00:03:06.190> over<00:03:06.220> that<00:03:06.610> way<00:03:06.820> and<00:03:07.750> we

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
there the rock is over that way and we

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:13.550 
there the rock is over that way and we
just<00:03:08.160> sprint

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.380 

drop<00:03:14.160> down<00:03:16.100> and<00:03:17.100> we<00:03:17.190> just<00:03:17.220> about<00:03:17.700> mediums<00:03:18.210> on

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
drop down and we just about mediums on

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.960 
drop down and we just about mediums on
zero<00:03:21.260> right<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:22.560> then<00:03:22.770> you<00:03:23.040> try<00:03:23.340> and<00:03:23.370> make

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
zero right and then you try and make

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:54.090 
basically that's what I tend to do but

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:56.810 
basically that's what I tend to do but
you<00:06:54.240> a<00:06:54.270> try<00:06:54.720> and<00:06:54.840> get<00:06:54.990> around<00:06:55.080> there<00:06:55.410> just<00:06:55.820> gave

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:56.820

you a try and get around there just gave
warning<00:06:57.180> up<00:06:57.330> go<00:06:57.810> around<00:06:58.169> the<00:06:58.500> tree<00:06:59.039> try<00:06:59.820> and

00:06:59.930 --> 00:06:59.940 
warning up go around the tree try and

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.640 
warning up go around the tree try and
jump<00:07:00.090> through<00:07:00.180> the<00:07:00.539> gap<00:07:00.750> but<00:07:01.289> as<00:07:01.380> you<00:07:01.500> can<00:07:01.590> see

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:01.650 
jump through the gap but as you can see

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:08.719 
jump through the gap but as you can see
you<00:07:02.550> get<00:07:02.760> stuck

00:07:08.719 --> 00:07:08.729 

00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:20.580
