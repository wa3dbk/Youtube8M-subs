clearly the drawing process as i said
earlier<00:00:24.880> i<00:00:25.210> will<00:00:25.509> be<00:00:25.630> making<00:00:25.809> lectures<00:00:26.439> for

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:26.680 
earlier i will be making lectures for

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.229 
earlier i will be making lectures for
two<00:00:26.829> classes<00:00:27.040> beginners<00:00:27.970> to<00:00:28.210> intermediate

00:00:32.459 --> 00:00:32.469 
and advanced in the beginners class i'll

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:34.020 
and advanced in the beginners class i'll
be<00:00:32.590> focusing<00:00:32.739> on<00:00:33.219> the<00:00:33.309> basics<00:00:33.850> and

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 
be focusing on the basics and

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.090 
be focusing on the basics and
methodology<00:00:34.930> of<00:00:35.020> simplifying<00:00:35.649> complex

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
muscles but also their function so it

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.110 
muscles but also their function so it
will<00:00:56.530> become<00:00:56.829> easier<00:00:57.130> to<00:00:57.520> draw<00:00:57.760> out<00:00:57.790> of

will become easier to draw out of

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.600 
will become easier to draw out of
inspiration<00:00:58.930> rather<00:00:59.200> than<00:00:59.710> continuing<00:01:00.370> with
