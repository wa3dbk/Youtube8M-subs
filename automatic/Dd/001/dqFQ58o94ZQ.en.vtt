00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
because if it was broad daylight the CG

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:39.000 
because if it was broad daylight the CG
was<00:03:36.790> gonna<00:03:36.970> look<00:03:37.150> shitty<00:03:37.660> let's<00:03:38.350> just<00:03:38.560> let's

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
was gonna look shitty let's just let's

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.130 
was gonna look shitty let's just let's
just<00:03:39.070> make<00:03:39.370> that<00:03:39.610> clear<00:03:39.880> right<00:03:40.090> now<00:03:40.120> the<00:03:40.360> CG

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
just make that clear right now the CG

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.670 
just make that clear right now the CG
would<00:03:41.320> look<00:03:41.500> real<00:03:41.860> shitty<00:03:42.310> um<00:03:43.590> you<00:03:44.590> know

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
would look real shitty um you know

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.500 
would look real shitty um you know
you've<00:03:44.830> seen<00:03:45.010> how<00:03:45.130> transformers<00:03:45.970> looks<00:03:46.239> when

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
you've seen how transformers looks when

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.680 
you've seen how transformers looks when
it<00:03:46.630> when<00:03:46.959> it's<00:03:47.530> like<00:03:47.769> broad<00:03:48.250> daylight<00:03:48.700> so<00:03:49.330> it

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
it when it's like broad daylight so it

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.190 
it when it's like broad daylight so it
really<00:03:50.350> looks<00:03:50.739> obviously<00:03:51.280> fake<00:03:51.550> so<00:03:52.170> so<00:03:53.170> I

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
really looks obviously fake so so I

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.480 
really looks obviously fake so so I
could<00:03:53.440> kind<00:03:53.650> of<00:03:53.680> understand<00:03:54.130> why<00:03:54.280> they<00:03:54.460> would

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:54.490 
could kind of understand why they would

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:56.220 
could kind of understand why they would
make<00:03:54.730> it<00:03:54.880> very<00:03:54.910> cloudy<00:03:55.510> like<00:03:55.870> that<00:03:56.080> or

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
make it very cloudy like that or

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.770 
make it very cloudy like that or

whatever we'll see we got a long way to

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.980 
whatever we'll see we got a long way to
go
