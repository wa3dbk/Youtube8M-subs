00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:11.850 
thank you testing testing okay let's see

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:12.770 
thank you testing testing okay let's see
if<00:00:11.910> we<00:00:11.940> can<00:00:12.120> do<00:00:12.209> something<00:00:12.420> a<00:00:12.570> little<00:00:12.660> bit

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
if we can do something a little bit

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.470 
if we can do something a little bit
different<00:00:13.230> for<00:00:13.350> you

solve climate change it could be finding

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.239 
solve climate change it could be finding
clean<00:00:24.390> sources<00:00:24.749> of<00:00:24.869> energy<00:00:25.070> some<00:00:26.070> of<00:00:26.160> you

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:26.249 
clean sources of energy some of you

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:28.220 
clean sources of energy some of you
already<00:00:26.369> know<00:00:26.550> that<00:00:26.810> but<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:27.900> know<00:00:27.990> what<00:00:28.109> else

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230

there's no numbers to pick your computer
does<00:01:06.570> everything<00:01:06.870> automatically<00:01:07.620> and<00:01:08.340> of

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
does everything automatically and of

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.770 
does everything automatically and of
course<00:01:08.640> now<00:01:08.880> you're<00:01:09.090> thinking<00:01:09.450> how<00:01:09.630> on<00:01:09.750> earth

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
course now you're thinking how on earth

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.940 
course now you're thinking how on earth
do<00:01:10.140> this<00:01:10.290> work<00:01:10.670> so<00:01:12.140> that's<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.290> supercomputer

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
do this work so that's the supercomputer

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.800 
do this work so that's the supercomputer
that<00:01:13.979> designed<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.490> stealth<00:01:14.729> bomber<00:01:14.810> it's

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
that designed the stealth bomber it's

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:16.580 
that designed the stealth bomber it's
called<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.079> cray-1

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
called the cray-1

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.590 
called the cray-1
now<00:01:17.159> at<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.310> time<00:01:17.549> that<00:01:18.210> was<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.329> world's

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
now at the time that was the world's

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.600 
now at the time that was the world's
fastest<00:01:18.990> computer<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:20.189> was<00:01:20.280> equal<00:01:20.490> to

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
fastest computer and it was equal to

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.480 
fastest computer and it was equal to
thousands<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.210> home<00:01:21.390> pcs<00:01:21.840> but<00:01:22.530> home<00:01:22.680> pcs<00:01:23.040> are<00:01:23.310> a

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
thousands of home pcs but home pcs are a

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.550 
thousands of home pcs but home pcs are a
lot<00:01:23.700> quicker<00:01:23.850> now<00:01:24.119> can<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.509> guess<00:01:24.720> how<00:01:25.500> many

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
lot quicker now can you guess how many

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.240 
lot quicker now can you guess how many
home<00:01:25.799> pcs<00:01:26.159> equal<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:26.520> Cray<00:01:26.729> one<00:01:26.909> now<00:01:28.220> some<00:01:29.220> of

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
home pcs equal a Cray one now some of

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.730 
home pcs equal a Cray one now some of
you<00:01:29.430> are<00:01:29.579> probably<00:01:29.670> thinking<00:01:30.000> is<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.540> one<00:01:30.750> no

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
you are probably thinking is it one no

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.260 
you are probably thinking is it one no
it's<00:01:32.130> not<00:01:32.250> even<00:01:32.399> one<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.790> questions<00:01:33.180> the

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
it's not even one the questions the

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.920 
it's not even one the questions the
wrong<00:01:33.390> way<00:01:33.540> around

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
wrong way around

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.499 
wrong way around
there<00:01:34.350> should<00:01:34.560> be<00:01:34.710> how<00:01:35.310> many<00:01:35.490> Cray<00:01:35.729> ones<00:01:35.969> equal

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
there should be how many Cray ones equal

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.289 
there should be how many Cray ones equal
your<00:01:36.689> PC<00:01:37.369> because<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.460> answer<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:38.729> over<00:01:39.180> a
