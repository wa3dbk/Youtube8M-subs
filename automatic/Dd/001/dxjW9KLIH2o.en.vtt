that<00:02:10.569> I'll<00:02:11.569> put<00:02:11.750> a<00:02:11.780> nice<00:02:11.959> layer<00:02:12.170> now<00:02:12.379> if<00:02:12.500> you

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
that I'll put a nice layer now if you

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.130 
that I'll put a nice layer now if you
had<00:02:12.830> on<00:02:12.910> you<00:02:13.910> can<00:02:14.030> use<00:02:14.150> activated<00:02:14.629> charcoal<00:02:14.989> if

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
had on you can use activated charcoal if

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.330 
had on you can use activated charcoal if
you<00:02:15.230> wanted<00:02:15.440> to<00:02:15.560> keep<00:02:15.680> the<00:02:15.799> terrarium<00:02:16.069> really

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
you wanted to keep the terrarium really

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.670 
you wanted to keep the terrarium really
pure<00:02:16.549> not<00:02:17.330> so<00:02:17.569> much<00:02:17.720> negativity<00:02:18.140> in<00:02:18.319> an<00:02:18.440> open

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
pure not so much negativity in an open

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.110 
pure not so much negativity in an open
disturbance<00:02:19.280> but<00:02:19.519> you<00:02:19.640> could<00:02:19.760> put<00:02:19.910> a<00:02:19.940> lid<00:02:20.090> over

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
disturbance but you could put a lid over

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.240 
disturbance but you could put a lid over
activated<00:02:20.690> charcoal<00:02:21.260> on<00:02:21.440> there<00:02:21.620> will<00:02:22.069> help

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
activated charcoal on there will help

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.520 
activated charcoal on there will help
your<00:02:22.400> a<00:02:22.459> fire<00:02:22.700> either<00:02:23.049> then<00:02:24.049> you<00:02:24.170> put<00:02:24.349> a<00:02:24.379> little

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
your a fire either then you put a little

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.470 
your a fire either then you put a little
Spanish<00:02:25.129> moss<00:02:25.340> or<00:02:25.640> sphagnum<00:02:25.940> Moss<00:02:28.239> may<00:02:29.239> think

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
Spanish moss or sphagnum Moss may think

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.940 
Spanish moss or sphagnum Moss may think
of<00:02:29.540> it<00:02:29.629> as<00:02:29.720> like<00:02:29.870> a<00:02:29.900> little<00:02:30.470> thin<00:02:30.829> little

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
of it as like a little thin little

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.280 
of it as like a little thin little
blanket<00:02:31.459> you're<00:02:31.579> gonna<00:02:31.730> cover<00:02:31.940> the<00:02:32.120> whole

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
blanket you're gonna cover the whole

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.069 
blanket you're gonna cover the whole
double<00:02:33.290> so<00:02:33.379> what<00:02:33.530> this<00:02:33.650> does<00:02:33.890> is<00:02:34.810> it<00:02:35.810> prevents

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:36.079 
double so what this does is it prevents

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:39.099 
double so what this does is it prevents
the<00:02:36.260> soil<00:02:36.560> from<00:02:37.329> it<00:02:38.329> helps<00:02:38.540> prevent<00:02:38.840> the<00:02:38.870> soil

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:39.109 
the soil from it helps prevent the soil

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:41.170 
the soil from it helps prevent the soil
from<00:02:39.319> falling<00:02:39.980> down<00:02:40.190> into<00:02:40.459> the<00:02:40.579> pebbles<00:02:41.000> in

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
from falling down into the pebbles in

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.490 
from falling down into the pebbles in
one<00:02:41.329> I'm<00:02:41.510> getting<00:02:41.780> all<00:02:41.989> muddy<00:02:42.170> and<00:02:42.549> mucky<00:02:44.500> kind

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
one I'm getting all muddy and mucky kind

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:52.629 
one I'm getting all muddy and mucky kind
of<00:02:45.590> acts<00:02:45.739> like<00:02:45.829> a<00:02:45.920> little<00:02:47.349> net<00:02:51.250> so<00:02:52.250> I<00:02:52.280> get<00:02:52.519> that

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:52.639 
of acts like a little net so I get that

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:54.699 
of acts like a little net so I get that
in<00:02:52.849> there<00:02:53.030> but<00:02:53.780> it's<00:02:53.930> now<00:02:54.049> I'm<00:02:54.170> actually<00:02:54.319> I<00:02:54.530> put

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
in there but it's now I'm actually I put

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.050 
in there but it's now I'm actually I put
more<00:02:54.859> soil<00:02:55.130> in<00:02:55.370> there<00:02:55.519> but<00:02:55.880> I'm<00:02:55.970> gonna

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
more soil in there but I'm gonna

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.220 
more soil in there but I'm gonna
experiment<00:02:56.630> a<00:02:56.660> little<00:02:56.750> bit<00:02:56.900> with<00:02:57.019> the

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
experiment a little bit with the

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.890 
experiment a little bit with the
different<00:02:57.500> I<00:02:57.560> want<00:02:57.739> any<00:02:57.859> trusting<00:02:58.599> state<00:02:59.599> for

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
different I want any trusting state for

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:01.839 
different I want any trusting state for
this<00:03:00.019> so<00:03:00.650> I'm<00:03:00.709> gonna<00:03:00.829> start<00:03:01.010> experimenting<00:03:01.370> a

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:01.849 
this so I'm gonna start experimenting a

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:05.020 
this so I'm gonna start experimenting a
bit<00:03:02.590> placing<00:03:03.590> some<00:03:03.769> rocks<00:03:03.980> and<00:03:04.340> stones<00:03:04.669> in

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
bit placing some rocks and stones in

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.229 
bit placing some rocks and stones in
there<00:03:05.980> some<00:03:06.980> different<00:03:07.310> types<00:03:07.579> of<00:03:07.730> stones<00:03:07.970> to

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
there some different types of stones to

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:09.789 
there some different types of stones to
try<00:03:08.329> to<00:03:08.510> get<00:03:08.660> an<00:03:08.750> interesting<00:03:08.989> arrangement<00:03:09.380> in

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
try to get an interesting arrangement in

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:12.220 
try to get an interesting arrangement in
the<00:03:09.889> center<00:03:10.250> and<00:03:10.489> then<00:03:10.700> I'll<00:03:10.880> actually<00:03:11.230> fill

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
the center and then I'll actually fill

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.110 
the center and then I'll actually fill
it<00:03:12.349> up<00:03:12.440> some<00:03:12.680> more

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
it up some more

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.610 
it up some more
with<00:03:14.120> more<00:03:14.329> soil<00:03:14.569> and<00:03:14.989> pull<00:03:15.109> up<00:03:15.169> so<00:03:15.349> that's<00:03:15.470> it

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
with more soil and pull up so that's it

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.680 
with more soil and pull up so that's it
you<00:03:15.709> should<00:03:15.859> do<00:03:16.060> some<00:03:17.060> interesting<00:03:17.299> rocks

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
you should do some interesting rocks

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.089 
you should do some interesting rocks
they<00:03:17.840> get<00:03:17.959> different<00:03:18.079> colors<00:03:18.470> here<00:03:18.650> kind<00:03:19.040> of

00:03:19.089 --> 00:03:19.099 
they get different colors here kind of

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:42.140 
they get different colors here kind of
nice

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.070 

now<00:03:43.150> I'm<00:03:43.209> going<00:03:43.510> to<00:03:43.599> add<00:03:43.810> sand<00:03:44.260> and<00:03:44.620> a<00:03:45.780> bit<00:03:46.780> sand

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
now I'm going to add sand and a bit sand

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.440 
now I'm going to add sand and a bit sand
now<00:03:47.410> because<00:03:48.280> it's<00:03:48.400> kind<00:03:48.819> of<00:03:48.880> difficult<00:03:49.060> to

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
now because it's kind of difficult to

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.199 
now because it's kind of difficult to
get<00:03:49.599> the<00:03:49.720> sand<00:03:50.020> around<00:03:50.650> the<00:03:51.040> plant<00:03:51.340> once

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
get the sand around the plant once

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:53.400 
get the sand around the plant once
you're<00:03:52.360> not<00:03:52.390> them<00:03:52.630> planted<00:03:53.020> and<00:03:53.170> I've<00:03:53.260> got

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
you're not them planted and I've got

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:59.250 
you're not them planted and I've got
some<00:03:53.590> plants<00:03:53.950> here<00:03:57.300> got<00:03:58.300> my<00:03:58.390> first<00:03:58.600> plant<00:03:58.989> then

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
some plants here got my first plant then

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.570 
some plants here got my first plant then
what<00:03:59.380> I've<00:03:59.470> done<00:03:59.620> is<00:03:59.800> I've<00:03:59.950> trimmed<00:04:00.220> the<00:04:00.370> roots

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:00.580 
what I've done is I've trimmed the roots

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:39.129 
what I've done is I've trimmed the roots
down<00:04:00.790> quite<00:04:01.090> a<00:04:01.120> bit<00:04:01.300> on<00:04:01.450> that

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:41.209 

now<00:04:40.139> one<00:04:40.379> of<00:04:40.409> the<00:04:40.530> things<00:04:40.710> that<00:04:40.830> makes<00:04:40.979> it<00:04:41.099> look

00:04:41.209 --> 00:04:41.219 
now one of the things that makes it look

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:44.899 
now one of the things that makes it look
really<00:04:41.580> desert<00:04:41.969> this<00:04:42.749> is<00:04:42.810> the<00:04:43.050> arm<00:04:43.319> stones<00:04:43.909> so

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:44.909 
really desert this is the arm stones so

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:50.420 
really desert this is the arm stones so
place<00:04:45.300> the<00:04:45.449> stones<00:04:45.749> in<00:04:46.020> there<00:04:48.110> like<00:04:49.249> put<00:04:50.249> some

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
place the stones in there like put some

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.089 
place the stones in there like put some
stones<00:04:50.729> before<00:04:51.210> the<00:04:51.509> next<00:04:51.659> layer<00:04:51.870> of<00:04:51.960> sand<00:04:52.259> put

00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:53.099 
stones before the next layer of sand put

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:54.860 
stones before the next layer of sand put
some<00:04:53.310> stones<00:04:53.580> after<00:04:53.909> your<00:04:54.300> next<00:04:54.509> layer<00:04:54.659> of
