00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
because when the dehydrator starts to

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:57.819 
because when the dehydrator starts to
take<00:01:56.599> the<00:01:56.750> moisture<00:01:57.110> out<00:01:57.140> of<00:01:57.259> the<00:01:57.439> peppers<00:01:57.799> and

take the moisture out of the peppers and

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:02.529 
take the moisture out of the peppers and
forces<00:01:58.579> that<00:01:58.759> air<00:01:59.390> out<00:02:00.250> it<00:02:01.250> is<00:02:01.489> very<00:02:01.610> hot<00:02:02.149> in

spray<00:02:09.890> effect<00:02:10.569> so<00:02:11.569> make<00:02:11.870> sure<00:02:11.900> wherever<00:02:12.769> you

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
spray effect so make sure wherever you

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.039 
spray effect so make sure wherever you
put<00:02:13.160> your<00:02:13.220> dehydrator<00:02:13.670> that<00:02:14.329> it<00:02:14.450> is<00:02:14.569> outdoors

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:15.049 
put your dehydrator that it is outdoors

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:17.650 
put your dehydrator that it is outdoors
and<00:02:15.470> it's<00:02:15.590> also<00:02:15.769> away<00:02:16.400> from<00:02:16.760> any<00:02:17.150> where

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
and it's also away from any where

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.660 
and it's also away from any where
children<00:02:18.079> might<00:02:18.260> be<00:02:18.290> playing<00:02:18.620> or<00:02:19.069> you<00:02:19.489> have

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
children might be playing or you have

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.949 
children might be playing or you have
pets<00:02:20.000> anything<00:02:20.870> like<00:02:21.049> that<00:02:21.079> okay<00:02:22.480> so<00:02:23.480> go<00:02:23.870> ahead

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
pets anything like that okay so go ahead

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:27.039 
pets anything like that okay so go ahead
and<00:02:24.109> start<00:02:24.620> by<00:02:25.340> cutting<00:02:26.030> down<00:02:26.389> your<00:02:26.420> peppers

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.049 
and start by cutting down your peppers

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:28.870 
and start by cutting down your peppers
and<00:02:27.380> I<00:02:27.769> did<00:02:27.950> a<00:02:27.980> couple<00:02:28.220> of<00:02:28.370> different<00:02:28.730> batches

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
and I did a couple of different batches

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.289 
and I did a couple of different batches
so<00:02:29.180> far<00:02:29.630> so<00:02:30.200> some<00:02:30.470> of<00:02:30.500> them<00:02:30.799> I<00:02:30.980> removed<00:02:31.370> most<00:02:32.090> of

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299 
so far so some of them I removed most of

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:33.910 
so far so some of them I removed most of
the<00:02:32.420> seeds<00:02:32.660> and<00:02:32.959> some<00:02:33.139> of<00:02:33.290> them<00:02:33.440> I<00:02:33.590> did<00:02:33.769> not

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
the seeds and some of them I did not

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.590 
the seeds and some of them I did not
remove<00:02:34.220> the<00:02:34.280> seeds<00:02:34.670> because<00:02:34.970> I<00:02:35.209> wanted<00:02:35.420> the

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
remove the seeds because I wanted the

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.069 
remove the seeds because I wanted the
different<00:02:36.260> heat<00:02:36.829> as<00:02:37.220> you<00:02:37.700> know<00:02:37.970> your<00:02:38.180> your<00:02:38.720> the

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:39.079 
different heat as you know your your the

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:40.479 
different heat as you know your your the
membrane<00:02:39.500> and<00:02:39.709> the<00:02:39.769> scenes<00:02:40.040> that's<00:02:40.250> where<00:02:40.459> a

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
membrane and the scenes that's where a

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.940 
membrane and the scenes that's where a
lot<00:02:40.850> of<00:02:40.880> your<00:02:41.180> heat<00:02:41.359> is<00:02:41.569> but<00:02:42.350> with<00:02:42.590> these<00:02:42.680> ghost

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
lot of your heat is but with these ghost

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.789 
lot of your heat is but with these ghost
peppers<00:02:43.310> even<00:02:43.819> just<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:44.329> wall<00:02:45.260> of<00:02:45.530> the<00:02:45.590> pepper

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
peppers even just the wall of the pepper

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.750 
peppers even just the wall of the pepper
is<00:02:45.980> extremely<00:02:46.519> hot<00:02:46.700> so<00:02:48.069> now<00:02:49.069> any<00:02:49.280> of<00:02:49.430> the

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
is extremely hot so now any of the

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.720 
is extremely hot so now any of the
peppers<00:02:50.150> that<00:02:50.180> look<00:02:50.569> like<00:02:50.720> they<00:02:50.930> were<00:02:50.989> not

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
peppers that look like they were not

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.910 
peppers that look like they were not
laying<00:02:52.730> flat<00:02:53.269> and<00:02:53.329> may<00:02:53.720> be<00:02:53.780> curling<00:02:54.290> over<00:02:54.680> on

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
laying flat and may be curling over on

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.770 
laying flat and may be curling over on
each<00:02:55.130> other<00:02:55.370> I<00:02:55.639> went<00:02:55.849> ahead<00:02:55.910> and<00:02:56.180> trimmed<00:02:56.480> them

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
each other I went ahead and trimmed them

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.420 
each other I went ahead and trimmed them
to<00:02:57.139> make<00:02:57.319> sure<00:02:57.500> that<00:02:57.680> they<00:02:57.859> would<00:02:58.010> lay<00:02:58.130> flat

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
to make sure that they would lay flat

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.620 
to make sure that they would lay flat
and<00:02:58.459> dry<00:02:58.849> nicely<00:02:59.480> and<00:03:00.760> then<00:03:01.760> I<00:03:01.819> put<00:03:02.090> them<00:03:02.150> in<00:03:02.359> to

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
and dry nicely and then I put them in to

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.039 
and dry nicely and then I put them in to
the<00:03:03.190> dehydrator<00:03:04.190> now<00:03:04.910> I<00:03:04.940> took<00:03:05.150> it<00:03:05.510> one<00:03:05.840> extra

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
the dehydrator now I took it one extra

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:09.759 
the dehydrator now I took it one extra
step<00:03:06.530> by<00:03:07.510> making<00:03:08.510> sure<00:03:08.750> that<00:03:08.959> I<00:03:09.019> dried<00:03:09.470> them<00:03:09.650> at

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
step by making sure that I dried them at

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:12.339 
step by making sure that I dried them at
a<00:03:09.799> very<00:03:10.130> low<00:03:10.459> setting<00:03:11.000> initially<00:03:11.690> for<00:03:11.989> three

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:12.349 
a very low setting initially for three

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:14.440 
a very low setting initially for three
or<00:03:12.440> four<00:03:12.560> hours<00:03:12.919> and<00:03:13.190> this<00:03:13.760> is<00:03:13.880> really<00:03:14.120> just<00:03:14.359> an

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
or four hours and this is really just an

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.330 
or four hours and this is really just an
extra<00:03:14.690> step<00:03:14.900> it<00:03:15.109> probably<00:03:15.650> is<00:03:15.859> not<00:03:15.919> even

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
extra step it probably is not even

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.250 
extra step it probably is not even
necessary<00:03:16.849> with<00:03:17.090> these<00:03:17.269> thin-walled<00:03:17.840> peppers

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
necessary with these thin-walled peppers

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.080 
necessary with these thin-walled peppers
but<00:03:19.069> it's<00:03:19.250> just<00:03:19.400> something<00:03:19.639> I'm<00:03:19.760> pretty

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
but it's just something I'm pretty

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.110 
but it's just something I'm pretty
accustomed<00:03:20.599> to<00:03:20.690> doing<00:03:20.870> and<00:03:21.669> the<00:03:22.669> reason<00:03:22.790> why<00:03:23.090> I

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
accustomed to doing and the reason why I

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.509 
accustomed to doing and the reason why I
dried<00:03:23.720> at<00:03:23.900> a<00:03:23.959> very<00:03:24.139> low<00:03:24.349> setting<00:03:24.739> initially<00:03:25.310> is

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
dried at a very low setting initially is

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:27.849 
dried at a very low setting initially is
just<00:03:26.239> to<00:03:26.359> kind<00:03:26.540> of<00:03:26.630> get<00:03:26.750> the<00:03:26.900> moisture<00:03:27.139> removed

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:27.859 
just to kind of get the moisture removed

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:29.409 
just to kind of get the moisture removed
from<00:03:28.070> whatever<00:03:28.430> vegetable<00:03:28.910> it<00:03:29.000> is<00:03:29.120> that<00:03:29.329> I'm

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:29.419 
from whatever vegetable it is that I'm

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:29.900 
from whatever vegetable it is that I'm
drying

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
drying

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.540 
drying
especially<00:03:30.780> with<00:03:30.900> the<00:03:31.020> thicker<00:03:31.290> wall<00:03:31.560> peppers

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
especially with the thicker wall peppers

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.450 
especially with the thicker wall peppers
is<00:03:32.880> important<00:03:33.510> because<00:03:33.690> if<00:03:34.140> you<00:03:34.620> dry<00:03:35.130> your

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:35.460 
is important because if you dry your

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.210 
is important because if you dry your
vegetables<00:03:36.450> at<00:03:36.630> a<00:03:36.660> high<00:03:37.350> setting<00:03:37.710> I<00:03:37.950> might<00:03:38.100> be

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
vegetables at a high setting I might be

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.640 
vegetables at a high setting I might be
a<00:03:38.250> little<00:03:38.580> bit<00:03:38.700> too<00:03:38.850> hot<00:03:39.060> you<00:03:39.690> can<00:03:39.900> develop<00:03:40.560> a

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
a little bit too hot you can develop a

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.890 
a little bit too hot you can develop a
hard<00:03:40.950> casing<00:03:41.610> on<00:03:41.880> the<00:03:41.910> outside<00:03:42.450> of<00:03:42.750> whatever

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
hard casing on the outside of whatever

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.140 
hard casing on the outside of whatever
it<00:03:43.170> is<00:03:43.200> you're<00:03:43.380> drying<00:03:43.650> and<00:03:44.010> then<00:03:44.970> the

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
it is you're drying and then the

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.390 
it is you're drying and then the
moisture<00:03:45.570> on<00:03:45.630> the<00:03:45.930> inside<00:03:45.960> of<00:03:46.830> the<00:03:46.920> vegetable

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
moisture on the inside of the vegetable

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.460 
moisture on the inside of the vegetable
cannot<00:03:47.820> be<00:03:47.940> removed<00:03:48.360> so<00:03:49.020> you<00:03:49.140> don't<00:03:49.290> want<00:03:49.410> to

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470 
cannot be removed so you don't want to

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.760 
cannot be removed so you don't want to
have<00:03:49.590> any<00:03:49.710> kind<00:03:49.950> of<00:03:49.980> hard<00:03:50.220> casing<00:03:50.730> initially

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:51.770 
have any kind of hard casing initially

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.050 
have any kind of hard casing initially
created<00:03:52.770> on<00:03:53.040> the<00:03:53.160> outside<00:03:53.490> of<00:03:53.580> your<00:03:53.700> vegetable

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
created on the outside of your vegetable

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.710 
created on the outside of your vegetable
so<00:03:54.210> I<00:03:54.420> just<00:03:55.020> a<00:03:55.200> standard<00:03:55.620> practice<00:03:56.000> dry<00:03:57.000> things

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
so I just a standard practice dry things

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.920 
so I just a standard practice dry things
and<00:03:58.020> a<00:03:58.050> very<00:03:58.260> low<00:03:58.530> setting<00:03:58.950> initially<00:03:59.930> with

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
and a very low setting initially with

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.510 
and a very low setting initially with
vegetables<00:04:01.470> and<00:04:01.680> that<00:04:01.830> kind<00:04:02.010> of<00:04:02.040> thing<00:04:02.280> and

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
vegetables and that kind of thing and

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
dehydrator outdoors what it will do is

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.280 
dehydrator outdoors what it will do is
start<00:04:44.100> to<00:04:44.400> reabsorb<00:04:45.120> the<00:04:45.240> humidity<00:04:45.870> from<00:04:46.110> the

settle for just a few minutes and then

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.880 
settle for just a few minutes and then
you<00:05:50.340> can<00:05:50.490> go<00:05:50.640> back<00:05:50.820> over<00:05:51.210> and<00:05:51.620> pour<00:05:52.620> it<00:05:52.770> out

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:52.890 
you can go back over and pour it out

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:56.900 
you can go back over and pour it out
onto<00:05:53.220> your<00:05:53.460> parchment<00:05:53.940> paper<00:05:55.580> because<00:05:56.580> you<00:05:56.760> do

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:56.910 
onto your parchment paper because you do

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.420 
onto your parchment paper because you do
not<00:05:57.060> want<00:05:57.450> to<00:05:57.570> breathe<00:05:57.750> the<00:05:58.020> stuff<00:05:58.260> in<00:05:58.430> just

00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.430 
not want to breathe the stuff in just

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:00.740 
not want to breathe the stuff in just
and<00:05:59.610> then<00:05:59.700> just<00:05:59.880> take<00:05:59.970> a<00:06:00.000> look<00:06:00.240> at<00:06:00.390> your<00:06:00.570> powder

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
and then just take a look at your powder

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.330 
and then just take a look at your powder
and<00:06:01.110> make<00:06:01.260> sure<00:06:01.440> you<00:06:01.620> feel<00:06:01.770> like<00:06:01.890> it's<00:06:02.100> been

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 
and make sure you feel like it's been

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:05.420 
and make sure you feel like it's been
ground<00:06:02.640> up<00:06:02.820> very<00:06:03.450> fine<00:06:03.860> and<00:06:04.860> when<00:06:05.160> you<00:06:05.250> feel

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:05.430 
ground up very fine and when you feel

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.330 
ground up very fine and when you feel
pretty<00:06:05.700> comfortable<00:06:05.940> about<00:06:06.570> the<00:06:07.530> results<00:06:08.130> go

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340 
pretty comfortable about the results go

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.920 
pretty comfortable about the results go
ahead<00:06:08.670> and<00:06:09.030> you<00:06:09.240> can<00:06:09.360> transfer<00:06:09.720> it<00:06:09.780> to<00:06:09.840> your

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:09.930

thing you want is to have this in your
spice<00:06:26.610> cabinet<00:06:26.640> and<00:06:27.330> then<00:06:27.420> you<00:06:27.540> go<00:06:27.690> in<00:06:27.990> a

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:28.140 
spice cabinet and then you go in a

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:30.500 
spice cabinet and then you go in a
couple<00:06:28.470> of<00:06:28.560> years<00:06:28.890> and<00:06:29.220> if<00:06:29.910> you<00:06:30.000> didn't<00:06:30.300> label

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:30.510 
couple of years and if you didn't label

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:32.480 
couple of years and if you didn't label
it<00:06:30.810> you're<00:06:31.110> going<00:06:31.260> to<00:06:31.320> wonder<00:06:31.560> what<00:06:32.010> is<00:06:32.220> that

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:32.490 
it you're going to wonder what is that

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:34.130 
it you're going to wonder what is that
and<00:06:32.850> then<00:06:32.940> you<00:06:33.120> might<00:06:33.270> take<00:06:33.300> a<00:06:33.480> whiff<00:06:33.720> of<00:06:33.930> it

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:34.140 
and then you might take a whiff of it

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:37.070 
and then you might take a whiff of it
and<00:06:34.470> say<00:06:34.730> okay<00:06:35.730> I<00:06:35.760> remember<00:06:36.090> that<00:06:36.510> now<00:06:36.840> that's

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:37.080 
and say okay I remember that now that's

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.410 
and say okay I remember that now that's
that<00:06:37.260> ghost<00:06:37.500> pepper<00:06:37.770> powder<00:06:38.120> you<00:06:39.120> don't<00:06:39.300> want

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:39.420 
that ghost pepper powder you don't want

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.060 
that ghost pepper powder you don't want
to<00:06:39.480> have<00:06:39.600> to<00:06:39.720> figure<00:06:40.080> it<00:06:40.200> out<00:06:40.320> that<00:06:40.380> way<00:06:40.770> right

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:41.070 
to have to figure it out that way right

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:43.390 
to have to figure it out that way right
so<00:06:41.520> make<00:06:41.730> sure<00:06:41.760> you<00:06:41.970> put<00:06:42.090> a<00:06:42.150> label<00:06:42.360> on<00:06:42.660> it<00:06:42.690> and

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:43.400 
so make sure you put a label on it and

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.380 
so make sure you put a label on it and
then<00:06:44.400> you<00:06:44.520> can<00:06:44.670> just<00:06:44.790> go<00:06:45.000> ahead<00:06:45.060> and<00:06:45.240> start

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:45.390 
then you can just go ahead and start

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:47.210 
then you can just go ahead and start
using<00:06:45.570> it<00:06:45.840> I<00:06:45.900> love<00:06:46.230> to<00:06:46.350> throw<00:06:46.590> it<00:06:46.770> in<00:06:46.860> a<00:06:46.950> little

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:47.220
