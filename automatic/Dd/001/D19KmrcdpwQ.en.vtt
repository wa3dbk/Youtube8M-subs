00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.250 
at least that's what coaches will tell

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.390 
at least that's what coaches will tell
you<00:00:24.550> long<00:00:25.180> snapper<00:00:25.539> kicker<00:00:26.050> and<00:00:26.380> punter<00:00:26.410> each

you long snapper kicker and punter each

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.729 
you long snapper kicker and punter each
of<00:00:27.640> the<00:00:27.730> men<00:00:27.910> that<00:00:27.939> men<00:00:28.449> those<00:00:28.750> positions<00:00:29.169> for

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:29.739 
of the men that men those positions for

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:32.490 
of the men that men those positions for
the<00:00:29.860> Clemson<00:00:30.040> Tigers<00:00:30.250> here<00:00:30.820> in<00:00:30.849> 2010<00:00:31.540> know<00:00:32.200> the

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:32.500 
the Clemson Tigers here in 2010 know the

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.380 
the Clemson Tigers here in 2010 know the
importance<00:00:33.040> of<00:00:33.219> their<00:00:33.399> role<00:00:33.610> I'll<00:00:33.940> say<00:00:34.210> for

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
importance of their role I'll say for

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.510 
importance of their role I'll say for
field<00:00:34.600> goal<00:00:34.780> I<00:00:34.989> mean<00:00:35.320> it's<00:00:35.890> the<00:00:36.010> easier<00:00:36.399> of<00:00:36.460> the

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:36.520 
field goal I mean it's the easier of the

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.729 
field goal I mean it's the easier of the
two<00:00:36.610> snaps<00:00:37.030> so<00:00:37.600> basically<00:00:38.410> you're<00:00:38.559> more

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:38.739 
two snaps so basically you're more

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:41.190 
two snaps so basically you're more
focused<00:00:39.070> on<00:00:39.399> accuracy<00:00:39.820> and<00:00:40.210> so<00:00:40.690> basically<00:00:41.079> do

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.200 
focused on accuracy and so basically do

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.660 
focused on accuracy and so basically do
is<00:00:41.230> put<00:00:41.440> it<00:00:41.530> on<00:00:41.590> the<00:00:41.680> money<00:00:41.860> that's<00:00:42.399> more<00:00:42.550> of<00:00:42.610> a

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
is put it on the money that's more of a

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.160 
is put it on the money that's more of a
mental<00:00:42.820> game<00:00:43.000> as<00:00:43.300> in<00:00:43.480> terms<00:00:43.660> of<00:00:43.780> punt<00:00:44.020> it's

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
mental game as in terms of punt it's

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.569 
mental game as in terms of punt it's
more<00:00:44.320> physical<00:00:44.770> if<00:00:45.130> you<00:00:45.190> have<00:00:45.310> to<00:00:45.370> get<00:00:45.460> back

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:45.579 
more physical if you have to get back

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:48.120 
more physical if you have to get back
and<00:00:45.760> blog<00:00:46.000> so<00:00:46.690> i<00:00:46.720> would<00:00:47.020> say<00:00:47.230> i<00:00:47.470> actually<00:00:47.980> liked

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:48.130 
and blog so i would say i actually liked

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.560 
and blog so i would say i actually liked
punks<00:00:48.460> better<00:00:48.640> than<00:00:48.880> field<00:00:49.090> goals<00:00:49.270> get<00:00:49.420> off

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
punks better than field goals get off

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.240 
punks better than field goals get off
the<00:00:49.720> place<00:00:49.960> i<00:00:50.230> just<00:00:50.620> snap<00:00:50.770> it<00:00:50.800> as<00:00:50.950> hard<00:00:51.100> as<00:00:51.160> I

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
the place i just snap it as hard as I

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.770 
the place i just snap it as hard as I
can<00:00:51.310> and<00:00:51.489> get<00:00:51.820> back<00:00:52.000> and<00:00:52.180> try<00:00:52.270> to<00:00:52.329> make<00:00:52.450> a<00:00:52.510> block

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
can and get back and try to make a block

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.510 
can and get back and try to make a block
get<00:00:53.230> to<00:00:53.320> hit<00:00:53.470> somebody<00:00:53.680> try<00:00:54.040> to<00:00:54.070> make<00:00:54.190> a<00:00:54.220> tackle

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:54.520 
get to hit somebody try to make a tackle

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.430 
get to hit somebody try to make a tackle
so<00:00:55.060> I<00:00:55.090> would<00:00:55.239> say<00:00:55.360> field<00:00:55.570> goals<00:00:55.750> are<00:00:55.960> one

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
so I would say field goals are one

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.840 
so I would say field goals are one
hundred<00:00:56.500> percent<00:00:56.710> mental<00:00:57.280> and<00:00:57.489> punts<00:00:57.730> are

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
hundred percent mental and punts are

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.270 
hundred percent mental and punts are
more<00:00:58.090> physical<00:00:59.050> than<00:00:59.079> mental<00:00:59.260> my<00:01:00.070> confidence

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
more physical than mental my confidence

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.190 
more physical than mental my confidence
level<00:01:00.489> is<00:01:00.730> high<00:01:00.880> um<00:01:01.210> you<00:01:01.450> know<00:01:01.570> I've<00:01:01.720> always

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.390 
team I think the biggest thing is just
experience<00:01:28.270> I<00:01:28.690> know<00:01:29.110> what<00:01:29.320> to<00:01:29.470> expect<00:01:30.250> here

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:30.400 
experience I know what to expect here

experience I know what to expect here
practice<00:01:30.880> and<00:01:31.060> no<00:01:31.150> one<00:01:31.299> to<00:01:31.420> expect<00:01:31.840> in<00:01:32.110> the

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
practice and no one to expect in the

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.580 
practice and no one to expect in the
game<00:01:33.010> and<00:01:33.700> um<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:35.170> should<00:01:35.320> have<00:01:35.500> in

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
game and um you should have in

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.109 
game and um you should have in
confidence<00:01:36.100> whenever<00:01:36.400> I<00:01:36.460> go<00:01:36.610> out<00:01:36.670> there<00:01:36.940> that

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
confidence whenever I go out there that

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.140
