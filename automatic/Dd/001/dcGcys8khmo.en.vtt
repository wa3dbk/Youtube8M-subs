that ice bag let that roll down
well<00:02:45.450> that's<00:02:45.660> cooling<00:02:45.959> will<00:02:47.840> prepare<00:02:48.840> our

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
well that's cooling will prepare our

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.539 
well that's cooling will prepare our
dark<00:02:49.230> paint<00:02:51.470> dark<00:02:52.470> made<00:02:52.680> actually<00:02:52.920> I<00:02:53.130> take<00:02:53.430> an

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
dark paint dark made actually I take an

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:59.750 
dark paint dark made actually I take an
approach<00:02:53.850> it's<00:02:54.120> a<00:02:54.239> little<00:02:54.840> simpler<00:02:57.590> I<00:02:58.760> don't

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
approach it's a little simpler I don't

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:08.319 
approach it's a little simpler I don't
introduce<00:03:00.060> all<00:03:00.540> of<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:05.000> maple<00:03:06.000> syrup<00:03:06.389> and

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
introduce all of the maple syrup and

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:13.250 
introduce all of the maple syrup and
urban<00:03:09.530> dark<00:03:10.530> meat<00:03:10.709> I<00:03:10.739> tend<00:03:11.099> to<00:03:11.989> go<00:03:12.989> a<00:03:13.019> little

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
urban dark meat I tend to go a little

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.400 
urban dark meat I tend to go a little
heavier<00:03:13.680> on<00:03:13.739> the<00:03:13.889> duck<00:03:14.220> fat<00:03:15.079> because<00:03:16.079> again

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
heavier on the duck fat because again

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.089 
heavier on the duck fat because again
what<00:03:16.560> I'm<00:03:16.680> looking<00:03:17.069> for<00:03:17.340> here<00:03:17.700> is<00:03:18.859> more<00:03:19.859> of<00:03:20.010> a

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:20.099 
what I'm looking for here is more of a

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:24.400 
what I'm looking for here is more of a
confit<00:03:20.760> approach

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:37.360 

oh<00:03:24.860> yeah<00:03:34.930> yes<00:03:35.930> and<00:03:36.230> you<00:03:36.440> can<00:03:36.590> always<00:03:36.710> you<00:03:37.280> know
