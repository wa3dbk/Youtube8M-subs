00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
connectors first we want to connect the

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.299 
connectors first we want to connect the
barrel<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.720> socket<00:00:31.230> so<00:00:31.920> for<00:00:32.219> the

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
barrel and the socket so for the

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.040 
barrel and the socket so for the
connectors<00:00:32.759> we'll<00:00:32.969> lay<00:00:33.149> in<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.450> barrel<00:00:33.780> in

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
connectors we'll lay in the barrel in

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.770 
connectors we'll lay in the barrel in
the<00:00:34.079> lower<00:00:34.440> unit<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:35.579> top<00:00:35.940> unit<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.329> socket

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
the lower unit and top unit the socket

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.069 
the lower unit and top unit the socket
will<00:00:37.020> snap<00:00:37.350> in<00:00:37.620> real<00:00:38.250> tightly<00:00:38.690> into<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.870> top

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
will snap in real tightly into the top

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.200 
will snap in real tightly into the top
connector<00:00:40.739> so<00:00:41.100> you<00:00:41.129> just<00:00:41.370> kind<00:00:41.610> of<00:00:41.670> force<00:00:41.969> that

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
connector so you just kind of force that

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.270 
connector so you just kind of force that
in<00:00:42.420> there<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.170> go<00:00:43.290> so<00:00:43.860> when<00:00:43.950> you<00:00:44.010> put<00:00:44.160> it<00:00:44.250> on

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
in there you go so when you put it on

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.650 
in there you go so when you put it on
the<00:00:44.399> vise<00:00:44.550> grip<00:00:44.820> it's<00:00:44.969> not<00:00:45.149> going<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.420> fall<00:00:45.600> out

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
since it is the top section so they're

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.350 
since it is the top section so they're
designed<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.379> just<00:00:49.590> slip<00:00:49.890> firmly<00:00:50.820> over<00:00:51.000> the

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
the socket and the barrel well just

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.229 
the socket and the barrel well just
there's<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.469> section<00:00:59.370> that<00:00:59.430> goes<00:00:59.609> way<00:00:59.850> down<00:01:00.059> and

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
there's a section that goes way down and

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.330 
there's a section that goes way down and
firmly<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.350> beauty<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:01.649> this<00:01:01.800> system<00:01:02.039> is
