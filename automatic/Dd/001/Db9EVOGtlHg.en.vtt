00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:16.439
 and that's our unboxing the jbj's 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:19.570
 actually not so sorry weapon because 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:23.800
 I'll do the logo is still synonymous 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.630
 do not strike elite but from the whole 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.869
 normal enzberg weapon just 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:32.080
 getting a new design is once 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:34.620
 to see the and track logo and japan 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.620
 but out 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:16.690
 with two ladders one of the delivers without 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.690
 get involved 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:36.560
 because these are written black and we 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:40.040
 practice that in there you do not see but 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.540
 it does not paint black but what 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.570
 directly also still cool noticed here 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.390
 In front is such a small orange part 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:55.100
 been made of it 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:59.360
 also not from here with the rating 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:01.100
 from the logo as well so now that one 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:06.710
 little accident are not for me 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:09.020
 as well as others actually say there 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.940
 also to adapt exactly the same way 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:17.350
 that this part 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:20.860
 and yes loaded the part of reinsteckt 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:30.650
 too heavy for the down a lever now 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:33.230
 not so graf So now you can here 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.930
 I actually recommend it relatively 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.170
 could make the home here 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.160
 maybe two little things here 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.370
 you can improve the white now 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.190
 looks a bit harder here 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.190
 not so good out here either 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.490
 not as 19 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:54.470
 the edges are not very clean 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.910
 but there is actually more 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.590
 on the firepower and that is 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:01.100
 of course at the j enormous for such a 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.770
 small weapons and yes the two defects the 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.430
 you can fix that 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:10.160
 ok I think that's it was ours 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:12.880
 short unboxing george we are there 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.880
 at the next video
