00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.340
 hello ladies and gentlemen today we are 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.900
 tell you about how to 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.300
 accept apartments in new building 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.250
 this is a very important point as it is 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.410
 a certain risk will not notice all those 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.840
 shortcomings made by the developer 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.220
 the elimination of which you can subsequently 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.930
 lie on your shoulders and come 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.579
 additional costs and how 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.170
 correctly to take apartments new buildings 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.739
 our specialist will tell you 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.280
 real estate 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.180
 Alexander I now will tell you that 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.510
 need not with you 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:54.449
 when accepting an apartment with us now 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:57.059
 there is a checklist checklist 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.129
 which we will carry out the acceptance 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.780
 let's take a look at this apartment 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:06.650
 we will need this when accepting an apartment 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.650
 building level 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:13.920
 Roulette lamp for checking 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.510
 electricity will also be required 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.270
 special device for checking 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:21.900
 line voltage 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.730
 possible small need flashlight for 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.560
 ventilation checks will be required 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:29.520
 lighter 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:33.330
 either matches all this we will write a lookout 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.900
 sheet but first we will fill 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.900
 check list 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:48.549
 So began the acceptance of the check-list 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:53.590
 we check the front door first 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:56.590
 if it is in place how it opens and 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:03.880
 closes as well as having 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:07.899
 locks on the front door closing them and 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.509
 discovery see whether everything is right 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:12.929
 propylene and 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.929
 No, no gaps 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:23.240
 after checking the doors we proceed to 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:28.840
 cop we look for cracks and chips 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:34.030
 the presence of pens on the glass 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:37.280
 check the opening and closing of windows 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:40.580
 the presence of seals wherever it is 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:43.390
 necessary and the absence of gaps when 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.390
 closed windows 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:53.950
 especially important that your window in the window 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.950
 doorway was securely fastened 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:08.380
 in the next step we will check 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:12.380
 walls ceiling and floor 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:19.090
 check the walls using a level 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:19.090
 we walk the plane of our walls 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.640
 look at the size of the gap 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:35.910
 if the gap is from more than five millimeters 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:39.550
 all claims we write to the developer 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:42.040
 also check to make installation seams and 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:47.110
 the joints were well sealed 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:49.420
 there was no gap next apartment with 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:54.370
 using roulette we check 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:55.360
 height trying which should 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.670
 fit 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.670
 specified equity agreements 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:09.220
 We look to the ceiling was not 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.490
 leaks and he was in uniform 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.490
 plane 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:32.860
 the floor must be conditionally smooth without obvious 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:36.800
 defects and cracks heating radiators 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:41.660
 should hang exactly on a small 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.590
 distance from the wall without different 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.980
 leakage 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:48.620
 at the places of fastening to pipes 

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:51.080
 the device must function in 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.979
 the heating system is best checked in 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.540
 autumn and winter to see her 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:59.750
 performance and notice different 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:02.090
 leakage if you invite to check 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:05.300
 town professionals will be with you 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:09.550
 laser level by which they 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:12.550
 check the curvature of the corners of the floor plane and 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.550
 ceiling 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:21.530
 in the next step we check the system 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:24.520
 water supply sewer and exhaust when 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:28.280
 water system check need 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:32.780
 view the serviceability of locking 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:33.830
 devices pipe integrity and lack 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:37.130
 leakage 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:38.110
 at the joints when checking the system 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:41.690
 sewage system 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:46.180
 pay attention to the integrity of the 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:49.820
 systems no different cracks 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:54.380
 stains presence of tees mandatory 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:57.560
 Well, in general, we study the whole integrity 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:59.889
 designs further we start checking 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.479
 ventilation systems 

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:06.470
 we study the integrity of the structure 

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:10.700
 to avoid various cracks as well 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:13.090
 check the exhaust hood itself we 

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:15.950
 check with a lighter 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:18.169
 either using a regular sheet which 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:21.080
 the diode must retract into the hole 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:23.689
 also the apartment must be brought 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:26.449
 electricity whose presence we 

00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:29.810
 check with the indicator screwdriver 

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:35.120
 either an ordinary light bulb all stages 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:37.759
 checks we put on the check-list and all 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:40.370
 detected notes upon acceptance 

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:41.300
 apartments we indicate a viewing sheet 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:43.909
 developer 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.319
 So let's summarize the acceptance of apartments 

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:47.120
 new buildings best to trust 

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:49.310
 some of whom are professionals 

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.199
 we are so professional 

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:53.599
 possess the necessary tool a 

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:55.900
 also experience gained in accepting many 

00:06:53.599 --> 00:06:55.900
 apartments
