from<00:00:20.369> lego<00:00:20.609> this<00:00:21.359> isn't<00:00:22.230> a<00:00:22.470> alternate<00:00:23.250> model

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
from lego this isn't a alternate model

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.609 
from lego this isn't a alternate model
that<00:00:23.760> I<00:00:23.789> found<00:00:24.060> on<00:00:24.210> Reeb<00:00:24.449> writable<00:00:24.779> now<00:00:25.350> this

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
that I found on Reeb writable now this

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.980 
that I found on Reeb writable now this
model<00:00:25.859> originally<00:00:26.550> was<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:26.760> three<00:00:27.090> in<00:00:27.180> one<00:00:27.210> so

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
model originally was a three in one so

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.380 
model originally was a three in one so
this<00:00:28.140> is<00:00:28.199> another<00:00:29.130> alternate<00:00:30.029> so<00:00:30.150> this<00:00:30.269> would

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
this is another alternate so this would

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.990 
this is another alternate so this would
be<00:00:30.449> like<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.810> fourth<00:00:31.140> model<00:00:32.009> anyway<00:00:32.489> I<00:00:32.610> found

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
this on Reba writable and it uses about

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
270 pieces and guys this is like a

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.770

the details so what inspired me to

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.160 
the details so what inspired me to
actually<00:00:47.640> find<00:00:47.969> this<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.390> build<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.930> that

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
actually find this and build it is that

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.549 
actually find this and build it is that

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
as a creator version I thought it would

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.069 
as a creator version I thought it would
be<00:00:58.530> pretty<00:00:58.770> neat<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.100> build<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.489> and<00:00:59.640> just<00:01:00.180> just

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
be pretty neat to build it and just just

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.160 
be pretty neat to build it and just just
to<00:01:01.410> get<00:01:01.649> familiar<00:01:02.399> with<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:03.690> look<00:01:03.899> of<00:01:04.080> the

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
to get familiar with the the look of the

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.260 
to get familiar with the the look of the
model<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.339> look<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.700> car<00:01:06.030> and

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.570 
March that I'll have a good idea of what
it's<00:01:13.290> supposed<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.680> look<00:01:13.860> like<00:01:13.920> when<00:01:14.250> I<00:01:14.280> get<00:01:14.400> it

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
it's supposed to look like when I get it

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.490 
it's supposed to look like when I get it
built<00:01:14.760> so<00:01:14.880> anyway<00:01:15.630> guys<00:01:15.780> this<00:01:16.020> one<00:01:16.200> really

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
built so anyway guys this one really

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.990 
built so anyway guys this one really
doesn't<00:01:16.680> have<00:01:16.920> any<00:01:17.040> features<00:01:17.460> as<00:01:17.670> far<00:01:17.880> as

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
doesn't have any features as far as

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.429 
doesn't have any features as far as
opening<00:01:18.330> doors<00:01:18.540> or<00:01:18.720> anything<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:19.110> just<00:01:19.140> kind

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
opening doors or anything it just kind

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.780 
opening doors or anything it just kind
of<00:01:19.470> rolls<00:01:19.710> along<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.189> looks<00:01:20.369> good

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
of rolls along and looks good

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.149 
of rolls along and looks good
and<00:01:20.880> it's<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.869> exact<00:01:22.200> same<00:01:22.259> scale<00:01:22.770> as<00:01:23.040> the

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
and it's the exact same scale as the

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.660 
and it's the exact same scale as the
original<00:01:23.610> one<00:01:24.110> so<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.140> just<00:01:25.560> I<00:01:26.040> guess<00:01:26.520> my

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
original one so I just I guess my

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.640 
original one so I just I guess my
question<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.270> is<00:01:27.420> do<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.170> have<00:01:28.320> this

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
question to you is do you have this

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.679 
question to you is do you have this
model<00:01:29.100> have<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:29.700> built<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.150> other<00:01:30.270> three

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
model have you built the other three

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.870 
model have you built the other three
models<00:01:31.110> and<00:01:31.320> would<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.159> be<00:01:32.310> interested<00:01:32.340> in

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
taking yours apart and building this one

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.980 
taking yours apart and building this one
from<00:01:35.490> Reeb<00:01:35.729> writable<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.270> instructions<00:01:36.869> are
