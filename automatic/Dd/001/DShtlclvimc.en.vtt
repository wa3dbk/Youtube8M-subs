00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 I would like to introduce you to your career 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:08.160
 always a model that is the 565 gp clb 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.559
 so here we thought about those to those and 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.690
 those who have a concern for aesthetics 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.599
 in their interior and here it is 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.359
 this is the sky b565 I looked like he 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.740
 is beautiful here it opens it closes 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.180
 yes of course as a quarterback 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.320
 obviously then it's not a quarter 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.240
 of time we could almost say it is 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.550
 an eighth of tail we will find 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.320
 exactly the same functions as in 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.510
 the cmp series that we saw 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.160
 previously since it's a cmpc sound 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.380
 brother but car2go version 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.600
 it has exactly the same functions and 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.020
 the scoop is that it exists in black 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.760
 very very chic varnish and in white varnish 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.290
 so watch out do not rush 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.719
 there will be none for all 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.829
 world it is true that we must have 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.480
 such a demand at yamaha in this 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.890
 moment with the white varnish but look 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.750
 how beautiful it is for the 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.739
 in love with aesthetics and design and 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.059
 lovers of music 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.890
 so I remind you that it's a piano that 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.960
 can be used on stage also 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.760
 since we have all the connectivity for the 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.539
 sound with auxiliary outputs in 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.329
 6 35 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.409
 we also have the USB port to device and 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.260
 yes because I told you everything to 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.640
 the time we could we could very well 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.990
 recorded wave format and well we will 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.270
 can do it on a small usb key 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.270
 we will be able to integrate quite successful 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.970

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:34.380
 I would like to tell you more but 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:36.720
 I'm asked to make the antenna so 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.980
 after the weather do not miss the newspaper 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:39.980
