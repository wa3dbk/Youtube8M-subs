 Hi everyone, here we are again 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.980
 finally video as you can see on the 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.510
 table we talk about 3d printing and think 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.280
 be the first in Italy to make a 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.500
 so big project especially on 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.260
 youtube 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.329
 this is a project that took about 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:35.519
 110,120 hours to print all 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.890
 pieces and as you will have seen from the title is 

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:40.140
 the sword and you can find the 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.629
 game kingdom hearts 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.819
 thank you video game dot com for 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.929
 the collaboration is also mainini 

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:48.960
 com point factors 

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:51.089
 I leave the link in description e 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.550
 you will find the sword in free download 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:55.199
 how the point com is made as you can 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.269
 to unload it we are slightly to the 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.260
 3d printer you can also print a 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:00.300
 home 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.510
 ok as you can see another day a 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.750
 a new haircut also the city 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.500
 compared to the present part of the video 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.659
 because I went to change 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.579
 slightly the model I made e 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.159
 reprinted some parts of the shoulder 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:17.340
 because some points were too fragile 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.890
 had not been printed well and are 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.600
 then went to assemble it as you can see 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.020
 sense by impression that when you go 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.579
 to download the model I from the site 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.439
 made a sheet in which I explain 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:30.719
 step by step how to mount the sword 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.299
 therefore you will not have problems in the assembly 

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:34.000
 my suggestions to add maybe 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.560
 between a 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.290
 as if to the other even maybe some 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.780
 right glue to make it all more 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.620
 hard and also really interested 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.530
 to someone 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.900
 then I had the painting done 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.810
 sword here and never did you do that they have 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:51.400
 just a dedicated room with some 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.660
 girls who only do this in practice 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.390
 takes care of prof 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.720
 post processing of the various models that 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:01.270
 are printed realized here is the 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.520
 finished model and dad this is the sword 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.240
 finished or painted rose glued 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.920
 far perfectly as you can see 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.450
 I am really satisfied being the 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.470
 my first model let's say big 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:17.170
 size I would say that's all I leave you 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.810
 maybe now some video of the picture already 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:23.320
 been taken and therefore should download 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.170

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.920
