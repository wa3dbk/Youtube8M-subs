think it's okay the same and the other

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.690 
think it's okay the same and the other
thing<00:02:52.920> I<00:02:53.300> like<00:02:54.300> so<00:02:54.569> much<00:02:54.750> is<00:02:55.080> that<00:02:55.140> it's<00:02:55.769> larger

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
it's a little bit strange because it

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.500 
it's a little bit strange because it
should<00:03:25.019> be<00:03:25.230> like<00:03:25.530> that<00:03:25.879> it<00:03:26.879> should<00:03:27.090> be<00:03:27.299> like
