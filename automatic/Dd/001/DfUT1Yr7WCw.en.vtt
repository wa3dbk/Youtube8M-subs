as<00:00:03.020> we<00:00:04.020> continue<00:00:04.590> along<00:00:05.160> the<00:00:05.970> spinal<00:00:06.510> cord

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
as we continue along the spinal cord

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.180 
as we continue along the spinal cord
notice<00:00:07.200> that<00:00:07.580> right<00:00:08.580> over<00:00:08.940> here<00:00:10.009> it<00:00:11.009> appears

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
notice that right over here it appears

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.270 
notice that right over here it appears
that<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:12.030> spinal<00:00:12.389> cord<00:00:12.690> again<00:00:13.019> begins<00:00:13.980> to

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
that the spinal cord again begins to

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.620 
that the spinal cord again begins to
enlarge<00:00:14.940> and<00:00:16.130> this<00:00:17.130> region<00:00:17.460> of<00:00:17.940> enlargement

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
enlarge and this region of enlargement

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.849 
enlarge and this region of enlargement
is<00:00:19.050> going<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:19.949> be<00:00:20.070> called<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.670> lumbar

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:21.859 
is going to be called the lumbar

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:26.029 
is going to be called the lumbar
enlargement<00:00:22.859> and<00:00:24.230> the<00:00:25.230> reason<00:00:25.619> it's<00:00:25.769> called<00:00:25.830> a

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
enlargement and the reason it's called a

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.550 
enlargement and the reason it's called a
lumbar<00:00:26.250> enlargement<00:00:27.150> even<00:00:27.449> though<00:00:27.689> it

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
lumbar enlargement even though it

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.429 
lumbar enlargement even though it
happens<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.160> be<00:00:29.310> found<00:00:29.699> in<00:00:30.089> the<00:00:31.019> vertebral

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
happens to be found in the vertebral

happens to be found in the vertebral
vertebral<00:00:32.099> canal<00:00:32.780> within<00:00:34.070> the<00:00:35.070> thoracic

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
vertebral canal within the thoracic

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.680 
vertebral canal within the thoracic
region<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:36.290> that<00:00:37.730> right<00:00:38.730> over<00:00:38.970> here<00:00:39.000> is<00:00:39.450> where

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
region is that right over here is where

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.980 
region is that right over here is where
you<00:00:39.840> have<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.350> spinal<00:00:40.830> segments<00:00:41.840> which<00:00:42.840> are

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:42.990 
you have the spinal segments which are

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.400 
you have the spinal segments which are
going<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.380> be<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.220> original<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:44.990> the<00:00:45.990> neurons

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
going to be the original of the neurons

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.800 
going to be the original of the neurons
that<00:00:46.710> are<00:00:46.770> going<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.160> form<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.880> lumbar<00:00:48.630> plexus

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:48.810 
that are going to form the lumbar plexus

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.910 
that are going to form the lumbar plexus
and<00:00:49.380> the<00:00:50.010> sacral<00:00:50.400> plexus<00:00:50.780> which<00:00:51.780> are<00:00:52.140> going<00:00:52.710> to

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
and the sacral plexus which are going to

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.810 
and the sacral plexus which are going to
supply<00:00:53.310> nerves<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:55.070> pelvic<00:00:56.070> region<00:00:56.550> and

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
supply nerves to the pelvic region and

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.340 
supply nerves to the pelvic region and
the<00:00:57.810> legs<00:00:58.350> and<00:00:58.760> so<00:00:59.760> right<00:01:00.630> over<00:01:00.660> here<00:01:00.960> we're

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
the legs and so right over here we're

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.759 
the legs and so right over here we're
going<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.590> have<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:02.100> higher<00:01:02.370> concentration<00:01:03.240> of

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769 
going to have a higher concentration of

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:09.649 
going to have a higher concentration of
neurons<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.390> hence<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.810> enlargement<00:01:08.659> this

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
neurons and hence the enlargement this

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.630 
neurons and hence the enlargement this
reason<00:01:10.200> why<00:01:10.320> we<00:01:10.469> here<00:01:10.829> where<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.189> have<00:01:11.460> the

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
reason why we here where you have the

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.569 
reason why we here where you have the
tapering<00:01:12.179> tip<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:13.409> spinal<00:01:13.679> cord<00:01:14.039> is

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:14.579 
tapering tip of the spinal cord is

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:19.160 
tapering tip of the spinal cord is
called<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.689> conus<00:01:16.200> medullaris<00:01:17.929> the<00:01:18.929> Pia

mater is coming off the conus medullaris
right<00:01:23.100> over<00:01:23.369> here<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.229> it's<00:01:25.229> going<00:01:25.409> to

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:25.469 
right over here and it's going to

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:29.599 
right over here and it's going to
continue<00:01:25.740> downward<00:01:26.869> to<00:01:27.869> form<00:01:28.289> a<00:01:28.619> structure

00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:29.609 
continue downward to form a structure

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:34.429 
continue downward to form a structure
called<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.999> filum<00:01:30.600> terminale<00:01:31.170> ii<00:01:33.229> here<00:01:34.229> is

the beginning of the file undetermined

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.730 
the beginning of the file undetermined
alle<00:01:36.569> and<00:01:36.899> we<00:01:37.140> can<00:01:37.319> follow<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.859> and<00:01:37.890> see<00:01:39.740> that

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
alle and we can follow it and see that

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.950 
alle and we can follow it and see that
it<00:01:41.460> is<00:01:41.609> eventually<00:01:41.909> going<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.630> attach<00:01:43.409> itself

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.760 

to<00:01:48.590> the<00:01:49.370> tapering<00:01:49.909> end<00:01:50.390> of<00:01:50.690> the<00:01:52.000> dural<00:01:53.000> sheath

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.680 
to the tapering end of the dural sheath
so<00:01:54.770> what<00:01:55.100> the<00:01:55.190> phylum<00:01:55.520> terminalia<00:01:56.060> is<00:01:56.300> doing

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.690 
so what the phylum terminalia is doing

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.550 
so what the phylum terminalia is doing
is<00:01:57.610> it's<00:01:58.610> going<00:01:58.850> to<00:01:59.030> provide<00:01:59.930> vertical

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
is it's going to provide vertical

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.850 
is it's going to provide vertical
stabilization<00:02:01.430> for<00:02:02.360> the<00:02:02.810> spinal<00:02:03.259> cord<00:02:03.500> just<00:02:03.560> I

the exit point for t12 spending right
over<00:02:20.030> here<00:02:20.450> we<00:02:20.870> have<00:02:21.170> the<00:02:21.410> exit<00:02:21.680> point<00:02:22.010> for<00:02:23.739> l1

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
over here we have the exit point for l1

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.509 
over here we have the exit point for l1
and<00:02:25.070> l2<00:02:25.640> and<00:02:26.269> so<00:02:26.420> forth<00:02:26.720> the<00:02:27.709> spinal<00:02:28.130> segments

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
and l2 and so forth the spinal segments

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.770 
and l2 and so forth the spinal segments
associated<00:02:29.239> with<00:02:29.450> l2<00:02:30.410> is<00:02:30.739> not<00:02:31.400> nearby<00:02:31.790> but<00:02:32.480> it

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
associated with l2 is not nearby but it

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.560 
associated with l2 is not nearby but it
is<00:02:32.959> further<00:02:33.320> up<00:02:33.580> where<00:02:34.580> you<00:02:34.880> have<00:02:35.180> the

is further up where you have the

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.390 
is further up where you have the
beginning<00:02:36.019> of<00:02:36.140> the<00:02:36.260> lumbar<00:02:36.620> enlargement<00:02:37.280> so

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
beginning of the lumbar enlargement so

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.009 
beginning of the lumbar enlargement so
it<00:02:37.519> will<00:02:37.640> be<00:02:37.730> somewhere<00:02:38.090> up<00:02:38.239> here<00:02:38.510> so<00:02:38.810> what

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
it will be somewhere up here so what

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.949 
it will be somewhere up here so what
happens<00:02:39.470> as<00:02:39.739> a<00:02:40.459> result<00:02:40.670> of<00:02:41.180> the<00:02:41.360> differential

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
happens as a result of the differential

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.840 
happens as a result of the differential
growth<00:02:42.080> of<00:02:42.410> the<00:02:42.530> spinal<00:02:42.830> cord<00:02:43.190> compared<00:02:43.700> to

growth of the spinal cord compared to
the<00:02:43.970> vertebral<00:02:44.420> column<00:02:44.769> is<00:02:45.769> that<00:02:46.610> the<00:02:47.150> roots

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
the vertebral column is that the roots

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:55.330 
the vertebral column is that the roots
elongate<00:02:48.739> and<00:02:52.570> go<00:02:53.570> to<00:02:53.630> their<00:02:54.140> respective<00:02:54.590> exit

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
elongate and go to their respective exit

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.830
