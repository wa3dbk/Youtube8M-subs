00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.540 

so<00:02:23.590> I<00:02:23.620> don't<00:02:23.709> know<00:02:23.890> if<00:02:24.010> I<00:02:24.070> just<00:02:24.100> have<00:02:24.400> really

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
so I don't know if I just have really

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.610 
so I don't know if I just have really
good<00:02:24.790> depth<00:02:25.030> perception<00:02:25.690> or<00:02:25.870> what<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.410> time

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
good depth perception or what the time

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.500 
good depth perception or what the time
this<00:02:26.890> this<00:02:27.310> part<00:02:27.730> of<00:02:27.820> the<00:02:27.880> achievement<00:02:27.940> wasn't

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
this this part of the achievement wasn't

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.300 
this this part of the achievement wasn't
hard<00:02:28.690> to<00:02:28.750> me<00:02:28.900> at<00:02:28.959> all<00:02:29.080> I<00:02:29.140> never<00:02:29.200> missed<00:02:29.739> I<00:02:30.010> got

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
hard to me at all I never missed I got

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.830 
hard to me at all I never missed I got
this<00:02:30.459> achievement<00:02:30.790> like<00:02:31.030> three<00:02:31.270> times<00:02:31.480> but

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
this achievement like three times but

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.340 
this achievement like three times but
I've<00:02:32.530> never<00:02:32.650> missed<00:02:33.130> it's<00:02:33.700> just<00:02:33.959> easy<00:02:34.959> to<00:02:35.080> get

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
I've never missed it's just easy to get

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.800 
I've never missed it's just easy to get
but<00:02:35.530> anyway<00:02:36.360> basically<00:02:37.360> you<00:02:37.480> just<00:02:37.510> shoot

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
but anyway basically you just shoot

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.720 
but anyway basically you just shoot
these<00:02:37.989> three<00:02:38.170> towers<00:02:38.380> and<00:02:38.980> you<00:02:39.280> can't<00:02:39.549> miss

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
these three towers and you can't miss

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.759 
these three towers and you can't miss
one<00:02:40.030> so<00:02:40.239> if<00:02:40.540> you<00:02:40.630> do<00:02:40.810> then<00:02:41.290> you<00:02:41.350> have<00:02:41.410> to<00:02:41.560> start

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
one so if you do then you have to start

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.280 
one so if you do then you have to start
over<00:02:42.090> but<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.239> thing<00:02:43.390> that<00:02:43.540> got<00:02:43.690> me<00:02:43.840> is<00:02:43.989> if<00:02:44.170> you

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
over but the thing that got me is if you

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.000 
over but the thing that got me is if you
look<00:02:44.440> at<00:02:44.590> here<00:02:44.799> these<00:02:45.130> guys<00:02:45.670> holding<00:02:46.209> the
