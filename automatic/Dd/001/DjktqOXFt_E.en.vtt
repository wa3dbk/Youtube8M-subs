00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.710
 hello dear friends today we are 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.570
 let's talk in the next one which was 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.070
 provided for review Novosibirsk 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.660
 shop knives blade be this knife 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.580
 Viper’s production facilities 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.550
 he has a box called classic 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.650
 4 thousand 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:27.290
 such a leg is not Yandex we are with you 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.419
 today we are dealing with such an Italian 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.919
 implementation of a classic hunting idea 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:33.530
 folder and then there is that it is the type of 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:36.050
 110 tank but here is the Italian version 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:42.769
 vader companies let's look at the knife 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:45.050
 closer we start with the fact that there are 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:46.429
 made massive overlays on the handle of 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.050
 the coco bola tree in this version 

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:49.609
 as far as I understand, as usually happens 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.539
 This manufacturer has a certain 

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:53.149
 user choice 

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:54.679
 Well, why does the output lining but at the same time 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:56.539
 constructions here are not removable and remove 

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:57.140
 it will be impossible to change such 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:59.690
 large 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.960
 steel bolster and have this knife 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.659
 Lanyard hole used for well 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.400
 frankly not the most not 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.050
 good because paracord here for sure 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.630
 it will not work very fine sometimes 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.460
 find something that could come here 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.560
 still we get as you can 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.600
 see it all in Italian such a trick 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.009
 back carefully executed here of course 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.810
 definitely nothing to complain about 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:22.759
 no sharp corners anything general all 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:28.850
 very well processed in this regard 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:30.979
 cool the knife has a backlog lock when 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.409
 this backlog is exactly as on 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.540
 classic 110 bakell very dense 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.670
 hold the blade in all its positions 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.680
 open it with one hand only well 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.030
 with great difficulty and something like this 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.070
 really, that is, in general, in principle 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.670
 the knife is designed for another opening 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:49.850
 however clearly he does not have 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.680
 no nail hooks 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.240
 the liner is like that 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.250
 subsequently developed but you see 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.880
 I completely pressed the knife not even 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:01.909
 fails there in no way here 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.729
 at the same time I want to show that it is quite 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:07.340
 it is possible that there are no any 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.750
 pucks between the blade and the flocks but like this 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.340
 here I at least can not see 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.280
 sufficient clearance for them to be there 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.780
 but nevertheless on the inside 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.630
 the liners themselves are made scott colored 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.580
 metal apparently lapul they are like on 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.330
 classic tanks are not lightweight 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.660
 apparently 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.570
 but it is believed that here is quite low 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.340
 friction between the blade of anime liners 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:32.000
 so that you can neglect washers well 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.500
 let's say so in the water and hunting folder 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.090
 of fast and opening does not enter it 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.740
 exactly the classic 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.660
 At least then when it seems 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.920
 the foot has designed the price no one 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:44.300
 tried to give him that opportunity 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:47.810
 so let's say this is the blade of this 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.910
 knife in general is a little bit classic 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:55.060
 bent and descents which are on such 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:58.730
 knives again taken viper classic 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:01.640
 drop point pretty powerful tip you can 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.740
 poking around if you suddenly need to 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:10.730
 this knife is used steel and now 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:12.050
 I will read you its name 1.41 16 this 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.220
 can be seen in technical 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.600
 characteristics of the knife which I 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.530
 I will definitely leave it written 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:20.209
 such a stainless one 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.500
 stainless steel but she's kind of visible 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.120
 European I mean with her not 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:24.709
 faced never before how much 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.470
 Often I can say nothing more 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.850
 as on the knives of the company itself viper well 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.530
 let's say most use 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.420
 other old men german pain russian 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:34.480
 began some 690 where he used 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.250
 for 2 for example whether something else of this kind 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.510
 That is, there are enough such 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.570
 interesting are these options 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.640
 what in general I want to say about this knife 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:46.190
 I will show more in weight now frame because 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.080
 what's on your pocket how do you understand by 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.440
 the absence of the clip will hold it 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.840
 it's impossible this whole knife 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.090
 also about 110 bucks 192 grams 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.810
 practically its weight is 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:03.290
 Well, I will say this implementation 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:04.970
 and 110 tank in this form to me personally, well, how 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.980
 would she not generally impressed i love 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.690
 such knives arrived in general yes I would be so 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.420
 said but they do n’t find any 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.459
 exploitation here I can say that but 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.709
 made a powerful chicken that night not sharp 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:17.690
 just straight i would say well probably 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:20.450
 sharpen than I would like places for 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.859
 such a household of a knife but it 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.990
 peculiar as a rule hunting 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.820
 such geometry because here he is 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.110
 geometry account cuts well and information 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.500
 thin enough that is in this regard 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:32.060
 everything is fine here and I would probably say 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.620
 so as not to spill the thought on the tree 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.630
 and 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.520
 you love this kind of thing 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.500
 hunting folder and generally this class 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.850
 knives then this knife is definitely worth it 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:41.500
 pay attention because he did 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:44.139
 pretty cool but he's another question what 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.780
 as if of course in modern life this 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:48.520
 class type knives and well personally 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.199
 it seems you need your true life and 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.550
 you can use it only because 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:52.360
 you just really like some 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.460
 such a classic 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:56.260
 however there are quite a lot of people like that 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.930
 who love this classic so well 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.550
 I think that these knives will be for a long time 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.050
 take pride of place in the model range 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.880
 viper companies are pretty normal 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:05.740
 I sell these here 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.330
 impressions about this knife hope you 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.139
 it was interesting thank you very much for 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.139
 view bye
