5870 eyefinity 6 series and six monitors
now<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:45.300> know<00:00:45.390> this<00:00:45.690> looks<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:46.050> little

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
now I know this looks a little

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.619 
now I know this looks a little
hodgepodge<00:00:46.500> right<00:00:47.190> now<00:00:47.370> but<00:00:48.120> we<00:00:48.239> do<00:00:48.390> have

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
hodgepodge right now but we do have

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.690 
hodgepodge right now but we do have
these<00:00:48.899> monitors<00:00:49.379> running<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.829> resolution<00:00:50.309> of

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
these monitors running a resolution of

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.650 
these monitors running a resolution of
50<00:00:51.090> 40<00:00:51.420> by<00:00:51.570> 2100<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.789> we<00:00:53.789> sped<00:00:54.090> out<00:00:54.120> against

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
50 40 by 2100 and we sped out against

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.840 
50 40 by 2100 and we sped out against
the<00:00:54.840> six<00:00:55.079> monitors<00:00:55.289> this<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.370> working<00:00:56.699> pretty

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.450 
the six monitors this is working pretty
good<00:00:56.969> right<00:00:57.750> now<00:00:57.780> we're<00:00:58.109> using<00:00:58.289> coal<00:00:58.980> McRae's

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
good right now we're using coal McRae's

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.139 
good right now we're using coal McRae's
dirt<00:00:59.820> to<00:01:00.059> as<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.239> test<00:01:00.600> game<00:01:01.670> in<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.820> future

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
dirt to as a test game in the future

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.880 
dirt to as a test game in the future
we're<00:01:03.359> going<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.539> actually<00:01:03.690> be<00:01:03.960> getting<00:01:04.170> six

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
we're going to actually be getting six

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.560 
we're going to actually be getting six
monitors<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.519> are<00:01:05.580> all<00:01:05.729> DisplayPort<00:01:06.420> that

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
monitors that are all DisplayPort that

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.210 
monitors that are all DisplayPort that
match<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:07.020> get<00:01:07.110> close<00:01:07.350> together<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.830> know<00:01:07.979> it's

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
match and get close together I know it's

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.969 
match and get close together I know it's
a<00:01:08.280> little<00:01:08.400> bit<00:01:08.580> difficult<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:09.090> see<00:01:09.420> but<00:01:10.110> for

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
a little bit difficult to see but for

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.170 
a little bit difficult to see but for
your<00:01:11.100> benefit<00:01:11.490> we<00:01:11.640> just<00:01:11.790> want<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.030> make<00:01:12.119> sure

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
your benefit we just want to make sure

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.399 
your benefit we just want to make sure
that<00:01:12.299> we<00:01:12.479> could<00:01:12.600> at<00:01:12.689> least<00:01:12.780> show<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.110> how<00:01:13.350> the

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
that we could at least show you how the

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.710 
that we could at least show you how the
six<00:01:13.740> monitors<00:01:13.979> work<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:14.880> I'm<00:01:15.509> going<00:01:15.689> to

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
six monitors work so I'm going to

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.899 
six monitors work so I'm going to
restart<00:01:15.930> this<00:01:16.290> race<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.860> just<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.670> let<00:01:17.759> you

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
restart this race and just to let you

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.789 
restart this race and just to let you
see<00:01:18.119> from<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.330> distance<00:01:18.360> you<00:01:18.840> know<00:01:18.869> how<00:01:19.560> this

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
see from a distance you know how this

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.990 
see from a distance you know how this
actually<00:01:20.070> looks<00:01:21.140> through<00:01:22.140> six<00:01:22.619> modders<00:01:23.100> so

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
actually looks through six modders so

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:33.140 
actually looks through six modders so
let's<00:01:24.180> take<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.390> look

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:40.640 

whoo<00:01:34.190> crazy<00:01:35.210> whoa<00:01:38.840> now<00:01:39.840> if<00:01:39.960> I<00:01:40.080> was<00:01:40.260> back<00:01:40.440> there

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
whoo crazy whoa now if I was back there

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.200 
whoo crazy whoa now if I was back there
in<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.800> back<00:01:40.860> like<00:01:41.370> you<00:01:41.520> guys<00:01:41.640> comprises<00:01:42.150> you

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
in the back like you guys comprises you

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.970 
in the back like you guys comprises you
to<00:01:42.330> the<00:01:42.450> camera<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:43.230> probably<00:01:43.500> get<00:01:43.740> a<00:01:43.770> better

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:43.980 
to the camera you probably get a better

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.370 
to the camera you probably get a better
angle<00:01:44.100> from<00:01:44.610> this<00:01:44.940> I'm<00:01:45.180> using<00:01:45.870> a<00:01:46.080> wireless

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
angle from this I'm using a wireless

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.530 
angle from this I'm using a wireless
keyboard<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.370> a<00:01:47.460> wireless<00:01:47.700> control<00:01:48.300> pad

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
keyboard and a wireless control pad

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.000 
keyboard and a wireless control pad
would<00:01:49.140> probably<00:01:49.500> be<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.590> lot<00:01:49.800> better

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.010 
would probably be a lot better

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.040 
would probably be a lot better
experience<00:01:50.640> than<00:01:50.730> this<00:01:51.060> not<00:01:51.720> like<00:01:51.900> that<00:01:52.020> right

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
experience than this not like that right

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.300 
experience than this not like that right
at<00:01:52.350> this<00:01:52.440> moment<00:01:52.620> just<00:01:52.920> don't<00:01:53.070> have<00:01:53.190> any

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
speakers hooked up sorry about that but

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.170 
speakers hooked up sorry about that but
at<00:01:56.460> least<00:01:56.580> were<00:01:56.760> showing<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.060> how<00:01:57.120> the

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
is pretty cool so overall I think this

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.140 
is pretty cool so overall I think this
is<00:02:58.350> a<00:02:58.410> pretty<00:02:58.500> cool<00:02:58.769> feature<00:02:58.950> it<00:02:59.580> still<00:02:59.970> has

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
is a pretty cool feature it still has

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.610 
is a pretty cool feature it still has
some<00:03:00.420> things<00:03:00.600> to<00:03:00.750> be<00:03:00.870> worked<00:03:01.080> out<00:03:01.260> and

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
some things to be worked out and

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.830 
some things to be worked out and
probably<00:03:02.459> the<00:03:02.670> most<00:03:02.820> important<00:03:03.330> thing<00:03:03.540> is

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
probably the most important thing is

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.949 
probably the most important thing is
having<00:03:04.110> the<00:03:04.350> exact<00:03:04.739> same<00:03:04.980> monitor<00:03:05.370> and

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
having the exact same monitor and

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.509 
having the exact same monitor and
recreated<00:03:06.959> six<00:03:07.320> things<00:03:07.560> that<00:03:07.830> way<00:03:07.980> all<00:03:08.220> the

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
recreated six things that way all the

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.460 
recreated six things that way all the
edges<00:03:08.880> will<00:03:08.970> be<00:03:09.090> next<00:03:09.330> to<00:03:09.450> each<00:03:09.600> other<00:03:09.750> and<00:03:10.019> the

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
edges will be next to each other and the

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.020 
edges will be next to each other and the
picture<00:03:10.800> will<00:03:10.950> actually<00:03:11.280> look<00:03:11.459> like<00:03:11.519> one

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
picture will actually look like one

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.360 
picture will actually look like one
solid<00:03:12.330> picture<00:03:12.959> but<00:03:13.470> at<00:03:13.680> least<00:03:13.830> for<00:03:14.100> our<00:03:14.190> lodge

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
solid picture but at least for our lodge

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.950 
solid picture but at least for our lodge
pod<00:03:14.670> design<00:03:14.880> we<00:03:15.540> got<00:03:15.750> it<00:03:15.870> going<00:03:16.170> we<00:03:16.560> got<00:03:16.769> it
