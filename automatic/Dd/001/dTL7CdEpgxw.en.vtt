00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.150
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.710
 high life foto gets and has been today 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.660
 my tip for today is photographed 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.070
 But I'm against it 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.540
 many are saying that now 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.220
 that should not be done that would be 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.830
 actually a mistake but I think 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.420
 if a motive if the person you are 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.039
 photographed from behind begins to 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:31.039
 the hairs start to bloom 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.390
 When flairs emerge light collapses 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.340
 if the photo is a little bit 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.080
 Milky then the effects are 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.180
 are really really nice and a photo 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.220
 make it really exciting and whether you 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.660
 that should or not from 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.560
 interested in any old rules 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.649
 not me because I'm a photographer 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.270
 Create a photo and design it that way 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.550
 how I like it 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.050
 the settings are on the spot 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.820
 not easy you can certainly 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.040
 do not shoot in automatic mode 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.570
 because the camera packs in place 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.130
 just not when he is full in the 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.040
 sun purely photographed the hat off in 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.360
 the manual mode and there you have to 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.890
 Now you kind of rantasten in the 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.300
 correct setting my tip sets 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.729
 First of all, that's so far down because 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.500
 have a lot of light in the picture then selects 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.430
 a dazzle out of the way you picture 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.009
 would like to design 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.510
 So in my case I do one 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:15.920
 dazzle wide open because I have the 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.310
 background out of focus so I would like to have 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:22.159
 now the turn of 28 and then try 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.510
 I adequate the exposure time 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.700
 find for these two settings 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.229
 I feel my way now ran and photography 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.479
 first with a relatively fast over 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.490
 a thousandth second and then looks 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.470
 whether the photo is properly lit is whole 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.430
 Of course I want the motive in the center 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.710
 illuminate properly 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.630
 the background will probably be 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.580
 burn out a little bit of the wee 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.960
 Too bright but that's exactly what it is 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.670
 what I want to have then you have to 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.040
 just a few photos in a row 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.659
 and you can rantasten and then you can 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.640
 her a really great photo in the end 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.170
 have just tried it out completely 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.540
 important is not looking directly into the 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.979
 sun and does not quite photograph 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.890
 directly into the sun, for example 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.960
 your model just in front of the sun 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:04.340
 that looks like it is behind it or 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:06.500
 put the sun to the edge of the picture or how 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.780
 I'm putting you here somewhere 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.120
 where also are disturbing background the the 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.549
 catch light a bit because otherwise 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.720
 is that just too crass and if 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:15.920
 you're looking directly into the sun is that 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.269
 also not very healthy 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.739
 I'm just going to be a bit 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.329
 take pictures and you the results 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.709
 try it out 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:23.709
 have fun bye
