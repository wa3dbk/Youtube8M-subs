we went ahead and rebuild the gearbox
again<00:02:33.420> with<00:02:34.019> a<00:02:34.049> super<00:02:34.410> high-performance<00:02:34.560> atom

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
again with a super high-performance atom

again with a super high-performance atom
factory<00:02:35.489> gear<00:02:35.970> kit<00:02:36.150> that's<00:02:36.269> going<00:02:36.450> to<00:02:36.510> bring

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
factory gear kit that's going to bring

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:38.210 
factory gear kit that's going to bring
the<00:02:36.720> gears<00:02:36.930> a<00:02:37.019> lot<00:02:37.260> closer<00:02:37.530> it's<00:02:38.040> going<00:02:38.160> to

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
the gears a lot closer it's going to

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.949 
the gears a lot closer it's going to
allow<00:02:38.280> us<00:02:38.430> to<00:02:38.580> accelerate<00:02:38.879> a<00:02:39.120> lot<00:02:39.299> faster<00:02:39.750> and

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
allow us to accelerate a lot faster and

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.780 
allow us to accelerate a lot faster and
so<00:02:40.260> to<00:02:40.349> keep<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.680> power<00:02:40.830> bed<00:02:41.130> exactly<00:02:41.670> where

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
so to keep the power bed exactly where

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.470 
so to keep the power bed exactly where
we<00:02:41.910> need<00:02:41.940> it<00:02:42.090> it's<00:02:42.569> going<00:02:42.720> to<00:02:42.780> be<00:02:42.840> so<00:02:43.079> rad
