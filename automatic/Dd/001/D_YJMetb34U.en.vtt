00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.100
 [music] 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:07.170
 the first thing you need to learn 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.120
 when working with automatic or assault 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.429
 rifle correct stand 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.139
 legs should be wide apart 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.509
 shoulders or slightly wider and slightly 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.840
 spring-loaded housing deployed to 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.300
 side of the goal and slightly tilted forward 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.279
 the next basic aspect is grip weapons when 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.849
 working with weapons is very important for 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.859
 especially get warm beginners get 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.840
 very tough and hold weapons that is 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.980
 she should be sent to the target 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.870
 directed strictly towards the target and 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.180
 arms and how to sum up in our line 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.030
 look that is not the opposite yes we are 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.629
 it is necessary to lift the case 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.390
 rests against the rib cage to create 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.940
 powerful support powerful hand triangle 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.440
 down to be lower and more 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.809
 human sustainability stress 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.670
 sting which is pressed accordingly 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.920
 This provision is the most 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.469
 protected as comfortable as for 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.140
 psyche body click during 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.330
 aiming the weapon rises and when 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.760
 the gunner is ready to open fire butt 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.400
 rests on the shoulder and creates a hard 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.350
 Grip from this position and fire 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.390
 with the finger on the trigger 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.250
 It is put only directly in front 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.240
 shooting 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.580
 it is possible that the situation requires 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.979
 moving with a weapon or hiking 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.409
 position either in marching march 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.720
 position the basic rule is not to direct 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.090
 weapons on people walking near and not 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.400
 raise the trunk too high because 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.189
 that a random shot and ricochet is possible 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.380
 if we are talking about the room to attack 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.600
 follows from heel to toe in case 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.299
 collision of the leg with any object 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.540
 the shooter has not lost balance this 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.220
 the rule is valid for any movement 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.030
 moving with a weapon requires 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.970
 maximum stability 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.329
 arrow both horizontally and 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:56.130
 vertical when speedy movement 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.350
 if we want to move from cover to 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.119
 shelter especially if we are doing 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.860
 fire is desirable to move so 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.659
 so that there is no wave 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.189
 jumps that person should go well as 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.340
 convincing ship 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.289
 lines as often as possible 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.120
 the situation at the shooting line requires 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.099
 change of body position a person should 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.140
 sit down or lie on the ground 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.690
 the best solution deep crisis 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.330
 which will provide the most sustainable 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.910
 body position although it is good only for 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.160
 small periods of time on the knee 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.080
 rationally leave if I am there 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.030
 stay for a long time 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:33.300
 that is, when sitting will be uncomfortable 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.690
 then one of well let's say this is not 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.160
 condition is a good wish to 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.050
 back leg which turns on 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.690
 knees to fingers 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.069
 were standing on the heel was raised 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.280
 up that is not flat 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.599
 why so in the first install 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.519
 muscle in a position that they are 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:52.739
 become stronger more mobile 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:55.110
 more explosive high speed technique 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.940
 lifting you can apply one of 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.879
 most important elements when working with weapons 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.470
 change shop shooter must perform 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:03.480
 this action as quickly as possible 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:07.200
 efficiently and safely 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.420
 you are observing either a target or an object 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.319
 what mod is in front of you for what 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.510
 to look 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.459
 which rests on the machine I side 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:16.830
 by sight windows at happening square and 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:19.760
 hard kept holding me friend 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:23.879
 Holds the belt does not win short levers 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:26.700
 so sticking shop or removed to dump 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:29.430
 either we get the next way half as well 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.379
 do we wear it with you if I have 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.150
 run out of ammunition 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:37.049
 then we deployed the reverse 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:39.900
 side of the load we continue 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:42.480
 gun shooting does not happen 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.769
 trivia so when shooting from a machine gun or 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.629
 automatic rifle 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.909
 you need not only competently fire 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:50.940
 targets but also abide by certain 

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:55.170
 shutdown algorithm occurs 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:57.000
 fire after which the finger goes to 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:00.180
 weapons slightly down 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.769
 We looked that he was mixing with you after 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.989
 bringing the weapon down 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:06.000
 looked at the comrades where they are with us 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.459
 where have run away who very veins print 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.799
 stayed watched that we have a weapon 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.920
 your pee and relaxed 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:14.300
 have a rest 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.519
 featured in today's storyline tricks 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.500
 working with for desktop weapons is only 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.570
 basic foundations that are necessary for 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.470
 mastering more complex actions on 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.810
 firing line 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:31.960
 upcoming programs we will continue 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:35.170
 the story of working with weapons is 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.170
