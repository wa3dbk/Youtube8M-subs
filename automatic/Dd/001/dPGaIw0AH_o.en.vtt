but not not that much so of course I'm

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.080 
but not not that much so of course I'm
new<00:04:19.989> in<00:04:20.019> this<00:04:20.409> Telugu<00:04:20.799> industry<00:04:20.919> and<00:04:21.400> I<00:04:21.579> don't

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
new in this Telugu industry and I don't

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.959 
new in this Telugu industry and I don't
know<00:04:22.300> the<00:04:22.479> language<00:04:22.659> so<00:04:23.229> I'm<00:04:23.789> learning<00:04:24.789> slowly

00:04:24.959 --> 00:04:24.969 
know the language so I'm learning slowly

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:25.720 
know the language so I'm learning slowly
slowly

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 
slowly

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:28.860 
slowly
it<00:04:25.790> is<00:04:25.910> difficult<00:04:26.200> but<00:04:27.200> being<00:04:28.160> an<00:04:28.310> actor<00:04:28.610> I

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
it is difficult but being an actor I

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.000 
it is difficult but being an actor I
think<00:04:29.870> language<00:04:30.380> is<00:04:30.620> not<00:04:30.860> just<00:04:31.280> you<00:04:31.610> know

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
think language is not just you know

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.690 
think language is not just you know
languages<00:04:34.010> doesn't<00:04:34.340> really<00:04:34.730> matter<00:04:35.350> because

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:36.700 
languages doesn't really matter because

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.150

like every day whenever we shooting some
new<00:04:54.320> scenes<00:04:55.060> so<00:04:57.700> it<00:04:58.700> is<00:04:58.940> a<00:04:59.120> little<00:04:59.390> difficult

00:04:59.740 --> 00:04:59.750 
new scenes so it is a little difficult

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.470 
new scenes so it is a little difficult
because<00:05:00.290> it's<00:05:00.620> not<00:05:00.860> your<00:05:01.040> mother<00:05:01.250> tongue<00:05:01.480> but

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:02.480 
because it's not your mother tongue but

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.390 
because it's not your mother tongue but
it's<00:05:02.870> not<00:05:03.140> that<00:05:03.380> difficult<00:05:03.440> also<00:05:04.130> that<00:05:04.280> you

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
it's not that difficult also that you

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.840 
it's not that difficult also that you
cannot<00:05:04.700> you<00:05:05.180> know<00:05:05.240> pottery<00:05:05.720> you<00:05:05.750> cannot<00:05:06.440> do<00:05:06.590> it

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
cannot you know pottery you cannot do it

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.090 
cannot you know pottery you cannot do it
so<00:05:07.850> it<00:05:08.300> is<00:05:08.510> a<00:05:08.540> little<00:05:08.720> difficult<00:05:08.990> but<00:05:09.350> but<00:05:09.950> I

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.100

comfortable<00:05:36.980> you<00:05:37.520> know<00:05:37.550> when<00:05:37.790> when<00:05:38.660> you<00:05:38.750> do

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
comfortable you know when when you do

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.440 
comfortable you know when when you do
something<00:05:39.200> that<00:05:40.130> on<00:05:40.340> that<00:05:40.640> hard<00:05:41.000> level<00:05:41.300> when

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:41.450 
something that on that hard level when

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:43.090 
something that on that hard level when
you<00:05:41.570> practice<00:05:41.930> that<00:05:41.960> hard<00:05:42.380> and<00:05:42.560> you<00:05:42.680> do<00:05:42.830> little

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:43.100 
you practice that hard and you do little

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.030 
you practice that hard and you do little
lesser<00:05:43.850> so<00:05:44.750> automatically<00:05:45.380> it<00:05:45.530> becomes<00:05:45.890> you

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:46.040 
lesser so automatically it becomes you

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.180 
lesser so automatically it becomes you
know<00:05:46.070> a<00:05:46.400> very<00:05:47.390> good<00:05:47.600> way<00:05:47.750> so<00:05:48.140> it'll<00:05:48.710> it<00:05:49.160> will

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.190 
know a very good way so it'll it will

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.240 
know a very good way so it'll it will
turn<00:05:49.490> out<00:05:49.640> really<00:05:49.820> well<00:05:50.090> I<00:05:50.120> think
