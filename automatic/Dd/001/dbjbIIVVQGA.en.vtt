00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:10.070
 hello to you all lady first it 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:13.309
 but the release of the project lachik we are again in the sump 

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.109
 kay again i'm showing you another 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:18.800
 Cleo script today's script will be 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:20.599
 enough wrecking to 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.570
 check will need any transport 

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:27.350
 funds in particular let's say bus 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.119
 nicknames taxi drivers mafia mechanics in general 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.949
 all even the police probably not even 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.449
 I will harm the cop now more 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.969
 than an ordinary dude but see if 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:37.879
 of course I will find it and so 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:40.339
 The essence of this is the cleo script 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:41.809
 allows you to throw people out of their 

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:43.579
 vehicles that is admissible 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.159
 dude rides the bus you come up 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:48.379
 press the f button and throw it away 

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:50.030
 further transport in theory belongs to you 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:51.979
 you can do anything with it 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.199
 you can blow it up 

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:57.530
 somewhere into oblivion under the texture well 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:58.100
 whatever you like it all depends on your 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.559
 whim 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.359
 but most importantly that it is worth 2 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.150
 protection actually that is we cannot 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:07.100
 throw people out of the car 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.140
 that is, let's check it often 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.600
 Well bullet policy we drive but this one 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:15.050
 it’s easy to steal a car 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.690
 I press the f button as you can see, I calmly 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:20.450
 I throw out now what can I do 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:22.220
 Sorry because of bugs advice I can him 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.880
 just ignite it and its not 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.920
 watch it should kick but no it 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.900
 I smacked but I punched the wheels for him 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.430
 and it is not visually at the dude 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.780
 the reality of the punctured wheel and it will 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:37.820
 go very strange so it's wagging in 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.400
 different sides unfortunately for some reason 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.680
 blow the car fails me well 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.570
 let's take a closer look at it in order 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.850
 to activate this cleo script 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.870
 you need to press the f10 button east you 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.760
 you press it 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.760
 but unfortunately appears 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:55.040
 activate it is impossible to have only activation 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:58.670
 but here it appears at the bottom of the screen 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:00.500
 the inscription that this creak is included now 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.680
 all we need to do is just 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:07.070
 approach the cars to open them to steal 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.440
 it turns out in this way, well, I don’t know 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.300
 let's have some fun for a start I want 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.430
 prove to you that this method is not visual 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.410
 not for this we use any 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.200
 vehicles that us 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.690
 given in this case the taxi driver I come up 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.550
 pressing the f button so so so where 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.550
 ran to where ran and where and where 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.990
 mate what a woman is here for some reason not 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.440
 it turns out to steal well let's go there 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.700
 Mechanics without any problems, look to start 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.070
 we play out the animation that i 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.560
 throwing it you need to knock down now we 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:38.990
 We sit in it click the button f3 themselves 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.750
 Well, now he can pull us out and 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:44.240
 the trick is that if you continue 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.760
 sit in the car and dude will try you 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:50.060
 throw out and he animation won't knock him off 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.850
 no therefore it is a kind of kicker well 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:56.300
 again let's see again 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.850
 so plant i sit down first thing i 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.480
 throwing out knock down animation sit down I press 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.480
 f3 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.090
 If mankind and tries to steal but also 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.160
 me, unfortunately, and what that is impossible 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.770
 sit in the car for too long otherwise you 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.480
 just throw out the server need it 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:13.490
 take into account that is literally two 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.410
 seconds if you are in those two seconds of 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:17.480
 trying to throw him out of it 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.060
 then there is no nafig so I came here 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.040
 Look at the taxi driver, let's send 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.940
 his car under the texture for this again 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.000
 I spend 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:28.450
 simple operations I press the f button 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.720
 force down the animation below f 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:34.160
 airbag and down but then sorry to go out 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.280
 did not have time to leave the ship 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.630
 the ship peeped at the hell it was necessary 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.120
 Click on this but you really need to 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:44.090
 have time to have a reaction to the same 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:47.900
 I have a multi cheat installed here already 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:50.000
 or break so not everything works like this 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.530
 perfect as my friends would like this forest 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.570

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.400
 how much really help you 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:58.700

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.830

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.880

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.130

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.050
 Well, there for example the car to but 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:09.200
