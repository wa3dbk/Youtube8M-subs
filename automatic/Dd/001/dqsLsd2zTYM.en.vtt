hey guys welcome to Planet victory and

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.030 
hey guys welcome to Planet victory and
today<00:00:05.850> I<00:00:05.879> just<00:00:06.150> wanted<00:00:06.359> to<00:00:06.450> demonstrate

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:07.040 
today I just wanted to demonstrate

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.980 
today I just wanted to demonstrate
decapitate<00:00:08.040> this<00:00:08.610> is<00:00:08.820> an<00:00:09.000> a<00:00:09.240> special<00:00:09.690> attack

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
decapitate this is an a special attack

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.270 
decapitate this is an a special attack
for<00:00:10.290> edged<00:00:10.530> weapons<00:00:11.120> it's<00:00:12.120> a<00:00:12.360> great<00:00:12.990> move<00:00:13.559> as<00:00:13.830> a

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
for edged weapons it's a great move as a

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.180 
for edged weapons it's a great move as a
one-hit<00:00:14.940> kill<00:00:15.360> move<00:00:15.630> so<00:00:16.080> you<00:00:16.650> can<00:00:16.800> use<00:00:16.949> it<00:00:17.100> on

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
one-hit kill move so you can use it on

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.150 
one-hit kill move so you can use it on
just<00:00:17.460> about<00:00:17.580> any<00:00:17.880> regular<00:00:18.330> zombie<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:19.080> in<00:00:19.830> one

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
just about any regular zombie and in one

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.099 
just about any regular zombie and in one
move<00:00:20.400> he<00:00:20.730> will<00:00:20.910> kill<00:00:21.270> the<00:00:21.420> zombie<00:00:21.750> that<00:00:21.960> is

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
move he will kill the zombie that is

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.160 
move he will kill the zombie that is
standing<00:00:22.470> in<00:00:22.590> front<00:00:22.680> of<00:00:22.830> you<00:00:23.510> now<00:00:24.510> that<00:00:24.869> is

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
standing in front of you now that is

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.040 
standing in front of you now that is
basically<00:00:26.090> the<00:00:27.090> thing<00:00:27.330> that<00:00:27.480> it's<00:00:27.599> got<00:00:27.779> going

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
basically the thing that it's got going

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.630 
basically the thing that it's got going
for<00:00:28.080> it<00:00:28.320> but<00:00:28.529> everything<00:00:28.920> else<00:00:29.099> comes<00:00:29.429> with<00:00:29.580> a

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
for it but everything else comes with a

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.370 
for it but everything else comes with a
long<00:00:29.880> list<00:00:30.090> of<00:00:30.330> kind<00:00:31.260> of<00:00:31.410> caveats<00:00:31.920> and

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:33.380 
long list of kind of caveats and

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.229 
long list of kind of caveats and
downsides<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.620> it<00:00:34.649> so<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.640> trickiest<00:00:35.940> part

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
downsides to it so the trickiest part

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.260 
downsides to it so the trickiest part
about<00:00:36.390> this<00:00:36.600> move<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:38.190> has<00:00:38.640> this<00:00:38.940> like

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
about this move is that it has this like

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.889 
about this move is that it has this like
1<00:00:39.690> second<00:00:40.200> delay<00:00:40.790> as<00:00:41.790> you're<00:00:42.180> kind<00:00:42.600> of<00:00:42.660> lining

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
1 second delay as you're kind of lining

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.110 
1 second delay as you're kind of lining
up<00:00:43.110> your<00:00:43.350> swing<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.829> in<00:00:44.309> this<00:00:44.489> one<00:00:44.670> seconds

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
up your swing and in this one seconds

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.540 
up your swing and in this one seconds
you're<00:00:45.270> vulnerable<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:46.230> any<00:00:46.680> zombies<00:00:47.160> around

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
you're vulnerable to any zombies around

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.819 
you're vulnerable to any zombies around
you<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:48.329> could<00:00:48.570> be<00:00:48.750> scratching<00:00:49.680> or<00:00:49.800> biting

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
you that could be scratching or biting

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.939 
you that could be scratching or biting
at<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:51.059> other<00:00:51.180> thing<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:52.050> does<00:00:52.680> only

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
at you the other thing is it does only

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.340 
at you the other thing is it does only
affect<00:00:53.610> one<00:00:53.850> zombie<00:00:54.090> so<00:00:54.570> it's<00:00:54.750> not<00:00:54.930> really<00:00:55.320> a

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
affect one zombie so it's not really a

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.000 
affect one zombie so it's not really a
good<00:00:55.530> option<00:00:55.739> for<00:00:55.920> crowd<00:00:56.309> control<00:00:58.010> even

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
good option for crowd control even

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.060 
good option for crowd control even
though<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.750> stamina<00:01:00.750> value<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:01.649> pretty<00:01:01.890> good

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
though the stamina value is pretty good

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.590 
though the stamina value is pretty good
considering<00:01:02.579> that<00:01:02.699> you<00:01:02.879> just<00:01:03.030> have<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.329> do<00:01:03.449> the

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
considering that you just have to do the

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.890 
considering that you just have to do the
one<00:01:03.780> move<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.379> then<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:05.040> get<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.250> dead<00:01:05.549> zombie

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
one move and then you get a dead zombie

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.480 
one move and then you get a dead zombie
if<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:07.049> try<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.290> spam<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:07.860> it's<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.159> little<00:01:08.369> bit

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
if you try to spam it it's a little bit

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.670 
if you try to spam it it's a little bit
slow<00:01:08.850> with<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.540> 1<00:01:09.720> second<00:01:10.140> time<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.560> it

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
slow with the 1 second time that it

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.530 
slow with the 1 second time that it
takes<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.220> happen<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:12.060> even<00:01:12.330> if<00:01:12.420> you

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
takes to happen so even if you

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.080 
takes to happen so even if you
repeatedly<00:01:13.140> stamp<00:01:13.500> spam<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.100> you<00:01:14.760> really

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
repeatedly stamp spam it you really

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.390 
repeatedly stamp spam it you really
can't<00:01:15.330> take<00:01:15.570> care<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:15.869> zombies<00:01:16.380> fast<00:01:17.040> enough

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
can't take care of zombies fast enough

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.460 
can't take care of zombies fast enough
for<00:01:17.970> you<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.150> prevent<00:01:18.420> getting<00:01:18.630> hit<00:01:19.970> now<00:01:21.470> given

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
for you to prevent getting hit now given

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.320 
for you to prevent getting hit now given
that<00:01:22.500> this<00:01:22.890> timing<00:01:23.369> thing<00:01:23.549> is<00:01:23.670> kind<00:01:23.880> of<00:01:23.970> tricky

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
that this timing thing is kind of tricky

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.910 
that this timing thing is kind of tricky
it's<00:01:24.509> actually<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.869> little<00:01:24.990> bit<00:01:25.110> forgiving<00:01:25.409> too

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
it's actually a little bit forgiving too

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.920 
it's actually a little bit forgiving too
because<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.400> has<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.580> lot<00:01:26.850> more<00:01:26.880> range<00:01:27.450> to<00:01:27.780> it

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
because it has a lot more range to it

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:28.910 
because it has a lot more range to it
than<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.229> might<00:01:28.380> expect

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
than you might expect

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.249 
than you might expect
so<00:01:29.430> if<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:29.700> swing<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.030> early<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:31.020> can<00:01:31.170> be

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
so if you swing it early you can be

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.350 
so if you swing it early you can be
pretty<00:01:31.530> safe<00:01:31.799> usually<00:01:32.790> we<00:01:32.909> just<00:01:33.090> get<00:01:33.210> into

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
pretty safe usually we just get into

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.080 
pretty safe usually we just get into
trouble<00:01:33.840> if<00:01:34.049> you<00:01:34.439> get<00:01:35.100> late<00:01:35.369> or<00:01:35.610> actually<00:01:36.060> just

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
trouble if you get late or actually just

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.569 
trouble if you get late or actually just
don't<00:01:36.540> have<00:01:36.780> time<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.560> start<00:01:37.860> swinging<00:01:38.250> early

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
don't have time to start swinging early

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.030 
don't have time to start swinging early
they<00:01:39.210> will<00:01:39.990> probably<00:01:40.439> get<00:01:40.590> hit

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
they will probably get hit

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.359 
they will probably get hit
now<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.689> other<00:01:42.869> negative<00:01:43.320> about<00:01:43.649> this<00:01:43.860> is<00:01:44.070> it

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
now the other negative about this is it

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.789 
now the other negative about this is it
will<00:01:44.610> not<00:01:44.850> work<00:01:45.060> on<00:01:45.299> special<00:01:45.840> zombies<00:01:46.380> such<00:01:46.590> as

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
will not work on special zombies such as

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.350 
will not work on special zombies such as
barrels<00:01:47.579> at<00:01:47.759> least<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.360> didn't<00:01:49.079> try<00:01:49.200> it<00:01:49.350> on<00:01:49.590> a

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
barrels at least I didn't try it on a

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.850 
barrels at least I didn't try it on a
screamer<00:01:51.360> but<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:52.020> will<00:01:52.110> probably<00:01:52.380> work<00:01:52.560> on<00:01:52.799> a

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
screamer but it will probably work on a

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.770 
screamer but it will probably work on a
screamer<00:01:53.189> but<00:01:53.490> not<00:01:53.729> on<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.030> feral<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.659> it's

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
screamer but not on a feral and it's

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.510 
screamer but not on a feral and it's
actually<00:01:55.079> bad<00:01:55.320> because<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.829> takes<00:01:56.100> away<00:01:56.490> your

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
actually bad because it takes away your

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.749 
actually bad because it takes away your
normal<00:01:57.240> power<00:01:58.140> attack<00:01:58.590> which<00:01:59.130> is<00:01:59.280> usually<00:01:59.729> the

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
normal power attack which is usually the

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.180 
normal power attack which is usually the
one<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.210> do<00:02:00.509> want<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.810> use<00:02:00.930> on<00:02:01.079> screamers

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
one you do want to use on screamers

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.280 
one you do want to use on screamers
anything<00:02:02.580> else<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:03.000> kind<00:02:03.210> of<00:02:03.330> them<00:02:04.140> as

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
anything else to kind of them as

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.700 
anything else to kind of them as
stunlock<00:02:04.620> as<00:02:05.040> possible<00:02:06.320> so<00:02:07.320> really<00:02:07.590> the

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
stunlock as possible so really the

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.650 
stunlock as possible so really the
question<00:02:07.860> in<00:02:08.430> the<00:02:08.640> end<00:02:08.790> it<00:02:09.150> comes<00:02:09.390> down<00:02:09.510> to

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
question in the end it comes down to

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.480 
question in the end it comes down to
what<00:02:10.229> is<00:02:10.880> the<00:02:11.880> use<00:02:12.540> of<00:02:12.900> this<00:02:13.230> skill<00:02:13.590> its<00:02:13.830> kind

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:14.490 
what is the use of this skill its kind

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:16.760 
what is the use of this skill its kind
of<00:02:14.640> seems<00:02:15.240> like<00:02:15.510> a<00:02:15.540> really<00:02:15.870> badass<00:02:16.140> looking

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
of seems like a really badass looking

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.980 
of seems like a really badass looking
skill<00:02:17.100> but<00:02:17.580> that's<00:02:17.790> kind<00:02:18.060> of<00:02:18.120> where<00:02:18.270> it<00:02:18.330> ends

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
skill but that's kind of where it ends

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.410 
skill but that's kind of where it ends
it<00:02:19.590> just<00:02:19.860> looks<00:02:20.310> really<00:02:20.400> awesome<00:02:20.970> but<00:02:21.120> doesn't

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
it just looks really awesome but doesn't

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:24.080 
it just looks really awesome but doesn't
have<00:02:21.600> too<00:02:21.900> many<00:02:22.020> practical<00:02:22.530> uses<00:02:23.010> for<00:02:23.220> most

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
have too many practical uses for most

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.970 
have too many practical uses for most
players<00:02:24.840> it<00:02:25.110> would<00:02:25.200> be<00:02:25.290> like<00:02:25.470> a<00:02:25.500> convenience

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
players it would be like a convenience

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.610 
players it would be like a convenience
use<00:02:26.490> if<00:02:26.760> you<00:02:27.360> just<00:02:27.390> want<00:02:27.720> to<00:02:27.810> dispatch<00:02:28.380> a

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
use if you just want to dispatch a

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.590 
use if you just want to dispatch a
zombie<00:02:29.070> quickly<00:02:29.850> and<00:02:30.000> get<00:02:30.150> them<00:02:30.270> out<00:02:30.390> of<00:02:30.420> your

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
zombie quickly and get them out of your

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.290 
zombie quickly and get them out of your
way<00:02:30.660> get<00:02:31.530> on<00:02:31.650> with<00:02:31.890> your<00:02:32.090> running<00:02:33.090> some

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
way get on with your running some

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.270 
way get on with your running some
resources<00:02:33.810> back<00:02:34.050> and<00:02:34.560> you<00:02:34.860> can<00:02:35.010> do<00:02:35.130> that

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
resources back and you can do that

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.700 
resources back and you can do that
quickly<00:02:35.940> and<00:02:36.390> efficiently<00:02:36.780> without<00:02:37.230> a<00:02:37.410> lot<00:02:37.620> of

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
quickly and efficiently without a lot of

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.740 
quickly and efficiently without a lot of
stamina<00:02:38.130> cost<00:02:38.370> but<00:02:38.700> these<00:02:39.180> are<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.510> times

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
stamina cost but these are the times

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.840 
stamina cost but these are the times
where<00:02:40.050> you<00:02:40.290> can<00:02:40.410> usually<00:02:40.920> take<00:02:41.460> care<00:02:41.490> of

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
where you can usually take care of

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.030 
where you can usually take care of
zombie<00:02:42.300> with<00:02:42.510> whatever<00:02:42.840> other<00:02:43.050> normal<00:02:43.680> attack

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
zombie with whatever other normal attack

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.000 
zombie with whatever other normal attack
so<00:02:44.910> it<00:02:45.300> seems<00:02:45.630> like<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:46.170> best<00:02:46.470> use<00:02:46.710> might

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
so it seems like the best use might

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.860 
so it seems like the best use might
actually<00:02:47.190> be<00:02:47.580> if<00:02:47.880> you're<00:02:48.330> a<00:02:48.390> stealth

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
actually be if you're a stealth

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.200 
actually be if you're a stealth
character<00:02:49.320> because<00:02:50.280> as<00:02:50.580> long<00:02:50.760> as<00:02:50.820> you<00:02:51.060> can

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
character because as long as you can

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.660 
character because as long as you can
avoid<00:02:51.540> attracting<00:02:52.320> groups<00:02:52.680> of<00:02:52.920> zombies<00:02:53.370> all

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
avoid attracting groups of zombies all

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.370 
avoid attracting groups of zombies all
coming<00:02:54.180> toward<00:02:54.540> you<00:02:54.660> and<00:02:54.840> you<00:02:54.930> don't<00:02:55.110> have<00:02:55.230> to

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
coming toward you and you don't have to

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.590 
coming toward you and you don't have to
get<00:02:55.500> into<00:02:55.650> a<00:02:55.770> crowd<00:02:56.070> control<00:02:56.490> situation<00:02:57.060> as

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
get into a crowd control situation as

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.110 
get into a crowd control situation as
long<00:02:57.900> as<00:02:58.020> you<00:02:58.200> can<00:02:58.380> dictate<00:02:58.850> taking<00:02:59.850> care<00:03:00.090> of

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
long as you can dictate taking care of

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.150 
long as you can dictate taking care of
zombies<00:03:00.600> at<00:03:00.750> your<00:03:00.960> own<00:03:01.140> pace<00:03:01.410> spreading<00:03:02.040> them

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
zombies at your own pace spreading them

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.520 
zombies at your own pace spreading them
out<00:03:02.250> one<00:03:02.640> after<00:03:03.300> the<00:03:03.450> other<00:03:03.480> then<00:03:04.290> that's

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
out one after the other then that's

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.130 
out one after the other then that's
probably<00:03:04.800> the<00:03:05.370> best<00:03:05.610> use<00:03:06.180> of<00:03:06.209> this<00:03:06.600> skill<00:03:06.930> so

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
probably the best use of this skill so

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.260 
probably the best use of this skill so
maybe<00:03:07.350> a<00:03:07.440> ninja<00:03:07.890> or<00:03:08.100> still<00:03:08.400> kind<00:03:08.790> of<00:03:08.820> character
