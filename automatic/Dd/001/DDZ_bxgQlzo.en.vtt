00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
course I just wouldn't have had the

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.130 
course I just wouldn't have had the
first<00:01:34.680> clue<00:01:35.220> how<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:35.939> go<00:01:36.150> about<00:01:36.240> learning<00:01:36.990> the

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
first clue how to go about learning the

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.200 
first clue how to go about learning the
things<00:01:37.409> I<00:01:37.590> did<00:01:37.770> at<00:01:37.890> university<00:01:38.400> on<00:01:38.610> my<00:01:38.790> own<00:01:38.939> I

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
things I did at university on my own I

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.030 
things I did at university on my own I
really<00:01:39.540> enjoyed<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.110> structure<00:01:40.560> that<00:01:40.590> design

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
really enjoyed the structure that design

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.380 
really enjoyed the structure that design
school<00:01:41.310> gave<00:01:41.490> me<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:41.909> think<00:01:41.970> I<00:01:42.180> would<00:01:42.240> have

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
school gave me I think I would have

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.510 
school gave me I think I would have
found<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.689> really<00:01:42.810> hard<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.380> challenge<00:01:44.340> myself

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
found it really hard to challenge myself

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.819 
found it really hard to challenge myself
as<00:01:44.939> much<00:01:45.119> if<00:01:45.360> I<00:01:45.450> was<00:01:45.600> hitting<00:01:45.750> myself<00:01:45.960> brief<00:01:46.470> so

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
as much if I was hitting myself brief so

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.249 
as much if I was hitting myself brief so
doing<00:01:47.250> assignments<00:01:47.880> even<00:01:48.270> though<00:01:48.600> at<00:01:49.110> me

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
doing assignments even though at me

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.350 
doing assignments even though at me
times<00:01:49.560> actually<00:01:50.130> hated<00:01:50.520> them<00:01:50.700> was<00:01:51.240> really

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
times actually hated them was really

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.480 
times actually hated them was really
good<00:01:51.600> for<00:01:51.780> me<00:01:51.899> I<00:01:52.110> also<00:01:52.649> think<00:01:52.979> that<00:01:53.040> you<00:01:53.220> can't

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
good for me I also think that you can't

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.460 
good for me I also think that you can't
become<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.850> good<00:01:54.180> designer<00:01:54.509> without<00:01:54.960> feedback

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
become a good designer without feedback

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.620 
become a good designer without feedback
so<00:01:56.100> design<00:01:56.729> school<00:01:56.969> has<00:01:57.119> that<00:01:57.299> built<00:01:57.479> in

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
so design school has that built in

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.999 
so design school has that built in
you're<00:01:57.780> surrounded<00:01:58.200> by<00:01:58.229> tutors<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:58.890> other

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
you're surrounded by tutors and other

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.319 
you're surrounded by tutors and other
students<00:01:59.399> who<00:01:59.490> can<00:01:59.610> give<00:01:59.700> you<00:01:59.790> feedback<00:01:59.969> all

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
students who can give you feedback all

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.389 
students who can give you feedback all
the<00:02:00.360> time<00:02:00.450> so<00:02:00.810> you<00:02:00.899> can<00:02:01.049> learn<00:02:01.259> from<00:02:01.590> what<00:02:02.369> they

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
the time so you can learn from what they

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.100 
the time so you can learn from what they
say<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:03.060> those<00:02:03.240> feedback<00:02:03.479> sessions<00:02:03.960> and

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
say and those feedback sessions and

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.450 
say and those feedback sessions and
design<00:02:04.350> school<00:02:04.590> really<00:02:04.860> helped<00:02:05.100> me<00:02:05.250> learn<00:02:05.399> how

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
design school really helped me learn how

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.609 
design school really helped me learn how
to<00:02:05.670> talk<00:02:05.909> about<00:02:05.969> my<00:02:06.270> work<00:02:06.509> how<00:02:07.079> to<00:02:07.140> present<00:02:07.320> it

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
to talk about my work how to present it

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.710 
to talk about my work how to present it
and<00:02:07.920> also<00:02:08.640> how<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:08.879> give<00:02:09.060> feedback<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.569> other

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
and also how to give feedback to other

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.540 
and also how to give feedback to other
people<00:02:10.020> how<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.259> critique<00:02:10.470> other's<00:02:10.979> work<00:02:11.220> I

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
people how to critique other's work I

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.790 
people how to critique other's work I
have<00:02:11.940> done<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.420> whole<00:02:12.599> other<00:02:12.840> video<00:02:13.020> about

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
have done a whole other video about

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.110 
have done a whole other video about
taking<00:02:14.190> if<00:02:14.400> you're<00:02:14.520> interested<00:02:14.790> in<00:02:14.880> that<00:02:14.910> if

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
taking if you're interested in that if

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.220 
taking if you're interested in that if
you<00:02:15.180> link<00:02:15.360> below<00:02:15.480> because<00:02:15.720> that<00:02:15.840> is<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:15.960> really

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
you link below because that is a really

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.410 
you link below because that is a really
important<00:02:16.620> skill<00:02:16.710> for<00:02:17.100> designers<00:02:17.850> to<00:02:17.880> learn<00:02:18.180> I

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
important skill for designers to learn I

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.540 
important skill for designers to learn I
think<00:02:18.720> a<00:02:18.810> very<00:02:18.840> common<00:02:19.320> misconception<00:02:19.550> about

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
think a very common misconception about

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:21.980 
think a very common misconception about
learning<00:02:20.970> design<00:02:21.330> is<00:02:21.540> that<00:02:21.720> it's<00:02:21.900> about

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
learning design is that it's about

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.720 
learning design is that it's about
learning<00:02:22.290> software<00:02:22.650> like<00:02:23.160> Photoshop<00:02:23.190> and

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
learning software like Photoshop and

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.390 
learning software like Photoshop and
illustrator<00:02:24.170> yes<00:02:25.200> learning<00:02:25.770> software<00:02:25.980> is<00:02:26.370> a

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
illustrator yes learning software is a

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.980 
illustrator yes learning software is a
big<00:02:26.700> part<00:02:26.940> of<00:02:27.060> being<00:02:27.120> a<00:02:27.390> designer<00:02:27.690> and

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
big part of being a designer and

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.170 
big part of being a designer and
mastering<00:02:28.890> software<00:02:29.070> knowing<00:02:29.640> all<00:02:29.790> the<00:02:29.940> short

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
mastering software knowing all the short

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.490 
mastering software knowing all the short
keys<00:02:30.390> and<00:02:30.600> things<00:02:30.660> like<00:02:30.840> that<00:02:30.900> can<00:02:31.230> make<00:02:31.290> you

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
keys and things like that can make you

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.100 
keys and things like that can make you
really<00:02:31.740> efficient<00:02:32.190> which<00:02:32.370> is<00:02:32.520> great<00:02:32.850> but<00:02:33.750> the

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
really efficient which is great but the

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.470 
really efficient which is great but the
software<00:02:34.890> is<00:02:35.010> just<00:02:35.400> really<00:02:35.670> a<00:02:35.700> means<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.390> an

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
software is just really a means to an

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.570 
software is just really a means to an
end<00:02:36.600> it's<00:02:36.870> a<00:02:36.960> way<00:02:37.080> of<00:02:37.350> visualizing<00:02:37.800> your<00:02:38.130> ideas

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
end it's a way of visualizing your ideas

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.040 
end it's a way of visualizing your ideas
it's<00:02:38.790> not<00:02:38.880> gonna<00:02:39.150> do<00:02:39.300> the<00:02:39.420> creative<00:02:39.750> thinking

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
it's not gonna do the creative thinking

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.780 
it's not gonna do the creative thinking
and<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.320> problem-solving<00:02:40.680> for<00:02:41.250> you<00:02:41.430> you<00:02:41.640> have

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
and the problem-solving for you you have

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.030 
and the problem-solving for you you have
to<00:02:41.880> do<00:02:41.970> that<00:02:42.120> yourself<00:02:42.210> as<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:42.960> designer<00:02:43.290> so

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
to do that yourself as the designer so

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.920 
to do that yourself as the designer so
you<00:02:44.670> can't<00:02:44.910> expect<00:02:45.210> to<00:02:45.270> just<00:02:45.480> learn<00:02:45.690> Photoshop

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
you can't expect to just learn Photoshop

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.660 
you can't expect to just learn Photoshop
and<00:02:46.440> suddenly<00:02:46.740> expect<00:02:47.130> to<00:02:47.190> be<00:02:47.310> a<00:02:47.340> really<00:02:47.520> good

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
and suddenly expect to be a really good

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.550 
and suddenly expect to be a really good
designer<00:02:47.940> I<00:02:48.240> hope<00:02:48.690> that's<00:02:48.900> not<00:02:48.960> too<00:02:49.170> harsh<00:02:49.380> to

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
designer I hope that's not too harsh to

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.590 
designer I hope that's not too harsh to
say<00:02:49.590> I<00:02:49.950> think<00:02:50.280> the<00:02:50.430> design<00:02:50.850> degree<00:02:51.150> that<00:02:51.300> I<00:02:51.360> did

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
say I think the design degree that I did

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.030 
say I think the design degree that I did
in<00:02:51.690> particular<00:02:51.900> which<00:02:52.290> was<00:02:52.530> a<00:02:52.560> Bachelor<00:02:52.980> of

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
in particular which was a Bachelor of

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.710 
in particular which was a Bachelor of
design<00:02:53.190> at<00:02:53.820> Massey<00:02:54.030> University<00:02:54.210> in

design at Massey University in
Wellington<00:02:54.870> was<00:02:55.350> a<00:02:55.380> four-year<00:02:55.650> course<00:02:55.950> was<00:02:56.730> a

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
Wellington was a four-year course was a

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.890 
Wellington was a four-year course was a
really<00:02:56.970> good<00:02:57.060> one<00:02:57.180> because<00:02:57.360> I<00:02:57.510> didn't<00:02:57.750> put

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
really good one because I didn't put

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.990 
really good one because I didn't put
much<00:02:58.050> focus<00:02:58.530> on<00:02:58.740> learning<00:02:58.980> software<00:02:59.610> it<00:02:59.850> was

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
much focus on learning software it was

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.090 
much focus on learning software it was
more<00:03:00.360> teaching<00:03:01.230> us<00:03:01.350> how<00:03:01.530> to<00:03:01.590> think<00:03:01.860> creatively

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
more teaching us how to think creatively

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.920 
more teaching us how to think creatively
and<00:03:02.610> how<00:03:02.730> to<00:03:02.790> think<00:03:02.880> like<00:03:03.210> designers<00:03:03.390> we're

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
and how to think like designers we're

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.630 
and how to think like designers we're
expected<00:03:04.350> to<00:03:04.440> learn<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.740> software<00:03:04.920> mostly<00:03:05.550> on

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
expected to learn the software mostly on

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.310 
expected to learn the software mostly on
our<00:03:05.730> own<00:03:05.940> so<00:03:06.270> yeah<00:03:06.390> I<00:03:06.420> was<00:03:06.570> focused<00:03:06.900> on<00:03:07.050> design

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
our own so yeah I was focused on design

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.290 
our own so yeah I was focused on design
thinking<00:03:07.350> and<00:03:08.100> how<00:03:08.370> to<00:03:08.430> respond<00:03:08.820> to<00:03:08.970> a<00:03:09.000> brief

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
thinking and how to respond to a brief

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.270 
thinking and how to respond to a brief
in<00:03:09.510> a<00:03:09.570> way<00:03:09.690> that<00:03:09.990> means<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:10.770> client<00:03:11.070> will<00:03:11.160> get

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
in a way that means the client will get

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.740 
in a way that means the client will get
the<00:03:11.400> result<00:03:11.670> they<00:03:11.850> want<00:03:11.880> nobody<00:03:12.390> was<00:03:12.510> a<00:03:12.570> fake

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
the result they want nobody was a fake

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.360 
the result they want nobody was a fake
client<00:03:13.110> but<00:03:13.230> still<00:03:13.470> it<00:03:13.830> was<00:03:13.950> learning<00:03:14.160> by

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
client but still it was learning by

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.250 
client but still it was learning by
doing<00:03:14.400> and<00:03:14.850> learning<00:03:15.720> by<00:03:15.900> getting<00:03:16.230> feedback

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
doing and learning by getting feedback

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.830 
doing and learning by getting feedback
along<00:03:16.800> the<00:03:16.860> way<00:03:16.980> that<00:03:17.460> Design<00:03:17.790> Thinking

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
along the way that Design Thinking

along the way that Design Thinking
erican<00:03:18.840> is<00:03:19.050> much<00:03:19.230> harder<00:03:19.500> to<00:03:19.620> learn<00:03:19.860> on<00:03:20.160> your

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
erican is much harder to learn on your

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.270 
erican is much harder to learn on your
own<00:03:20.610> or<00:03:20.970> from<00:03:21.330> a<00:03:21.510> course<00:03:21.810> online<00:03:22.110> I<00:03:22.590> think<00:03:23.040> you

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
own or from a course online I think you

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.650 
own or from a course online I think you
need<00:03:23.400> to<00:03:23.490> surround<00:03:23.820> yourself<00:03:24.090> with<00:03:24.420> other

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
need to surround yourself with other

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.860 
need to surround yourself with other
designers<00:03:25.260> and<00:03:25.800> start<00:03:26.580> getting<00:03:27.300> a<00:03:27.390> glimpse<00:03:27.570> as

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
designers and start getting a glimpse as

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.690 
designers and start getting a glimpse as
much<00:03:28.020> as<00:03:28.170> you<00:03:28.290> can<00:03:28.500> into<00:03:28.709> their<00:03:28.920> process<00:03:29.370> don't

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
much as you can into their process don't

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:30.980 
much as you can into their process don't
just<00:03:29.850> look<00:03:29.970> at<00:03:30.060> their<00:03:30.150> finished<00:03:30.450> work<00:03:30.660> and<00:03:30.900> try

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:30.990 
just look at their finished work and try

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:32.840 
just look at their finished work and try
to<00:03:31.050> emulate<00:03:31.470> it<00:03:31.590> you<00:03:31.950> need<00:03:32.190> to<00:03:32.310> understand<00:03:32.730> the

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
to emulate it you need to understand the

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.910 
to emulate it you need to understand the
process<00:03:33.270> that<00:03:33.450> went<00:03:33.630> in<00:03:33.840> behind<00:03:34.380> it<00:03:34.740> because

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
process that went in behind it because

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.140 
process that went in behind it because
that's<00:03:35.160> where<00:03:35.310> you're<00:03:35.400> gonna<00:03:35.520> learn<00:03:35.700> does<00:03:36.030> I

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
that's where you're gonna learn does I

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.430 
that's where you're gonna learn does I
meet<00:03:36.360> up<00:03:36.510> so<00:03:36.630> great<00:03:36.780> for<00:03:36.930> that<00:03:37.020> sort<00:03:37.260> of<00:03:37.290> thing

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
meet up so great for that sort of thing

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.140 
meet up so great for that sort of thing
I<00:03:37.560> guess<00:03:37.709> anywhere<00:03:38.130> you<00:03:38.280> can<00:03:38.400> just<00:03:38.580> talk<00:03:39.120> to

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
I guess anywhere you can just talk to

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.330 
I guess anywhere you can just talk to
another<00:03:39.510> designer<00:03:39.870> and<00:03:40.200> I<00:03:40.860> guess<00:03:41.010> following

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
another designer and I guess following

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.590 
another designer and I guess following
people<00:03:41.580> on<00:03:41.670> Twitter<00:03:41.880> who<00:03:42.060> sherrilyn<00:03:42.450> their

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
people on Twitter who sherrilyn their

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.000 
people on Twitter who sherrilyn their
process<00:03:42.959> would<00:03:43.140> really<00:03:43.320> help<00:03:43.470> us<00:03:43.650> well<00:03:43.860> you

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
process would really help us well you

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.040 
process would really help us well you
just<00:03:44.130> need<00:03:44.250> to<00:03:44.370> get<00:03:45.000> yourself<00:03:45.120> immersed<00:03:45.750> in

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
just need to get yourself immersed in

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:47.510 
just need to get yourself immersed in
that<00:03:46.170> world<00:03:46.230> so<00:03:46.709> that<00:03:46.980> you<00:03:47.010> can<00:03:47.220> start

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
that world so that you can start

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.280 
that world so that you can start
thinking<00:03:48.060> like<00:03:48.240> a<00:03:48.360> designer<00:03:48.690> as<00:03:48.870> well<00:03:49.050> I<00:03:49.170> think

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
thinking like a designer as well I think

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.680 
thinking like a designer as well I think
meaning<00:03:49.620> of<00:03:49.709> track<00:03:49.950> but<00:03:50.160> to<00:03:50.580> sum<00:03:50.760> up<00:03:50.940> if<00:03:51.150> you're

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
meaning of track but to sum up if you're

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:52.880 
meaning of track but to sum up if you're
wondering<00:03:52.050> if<00:03:52.170> you<00:03:52.260> should<00:03:52.410> go<00:03:52.500> to<00:03:52.560> design

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
wondering if you should go to design

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.710 
wondering if you should go to design
school<00:03:52.950> or<00:03:53.340> not<00:03:53.580> you<00:03:54.090> need<00:03:54.209> to<00:03:54.330> think<00:03:54.510> about

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
school or not you need to think about

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.210 
school or not you need to think about
what<00:03:54.870> sort<00:03:55.080> of<00:03:55.140> learning<00:03:55.440> would<00:03:55.770> suit<00:03:55.980> you

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:56.220 
what sort of learning would suit you

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.760 
what sort of learning would suit you
best<00:03:56.459> and<00:03:56.820> pick<00:03:57.420> that<00:03:57.600> one<00:03:57.959> option<00:03:58.290> isn't<00:03:58.530> any

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:58.770 
best and pick that one option isn't any

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:59.900 
best and pick that one option isn't any
easier<00:03:59.160> than<00:03:59.280> the<00:03:59.400> other<00:03:59.520> they're<00:03:59.760> just

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
easier than the other they're just

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.130 
easier than the other they're just
different<00:04:00.240> ways<00:04:00.360> of<00:04:00.540> going<00:04:00.630> about<00:04:00.900> it<00:04:00.959> you

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
different ways of going about it you

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.570 
different ways of going about it you
still<00:04:01.320> have<00:04:01.350> to<00:04:01.530> learn<00:04:01.650> the<00:04:01.860> same<00:04:02.010> stuff<00:04:02.370> in

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
still have to learn the same stuff in

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.760 
still have to learn the same stuff in
the<00:04:02.730> end<00:04:02.880> I<00:04:03.150> personally<00:04:04.110> like<00:04:04.320> I<00:04:04.350> said<00:04:04.620> would

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
the end I personally like I said would

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:05.870 
the end I personally like I said would
have<00:04:04.860> found<00:04:04.950> it<00:04:05.130> really<00:04:05.250> hard<00:04:05.580> to<00:04:05.760> learn

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
have found it really hard to learn

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.240 
have found it really hard to learn
design<00:04:06.120> by<00:04:06.390> myself<00:04:06.780> I<00:04:06.990> really<00:04:07.230> enjoyed<00:04:07.620> going

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
design by myself I really enjoyed going

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.590 
design by myself I really enjoyed going
to<00:04:08.400> university<00:04:08.880> and<00:04:08.940> having<00:04:09.180> that<00:04:09.300> formal

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
to university and having that formal

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.150 
to university and having that formal
education<00:04:09.690> I<00:04:10.320> don't<00:04:10.470> think<00:04:10.709> that<00:04:10.950> I<00:04:10.980> would

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
education I don't think that I would

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.830 
education I don't think that I would
have<00:04:11.370> been<00:04:11.550> challenged<00:04:12.060> enough<00:04:12.330> if<00:04:12.600> I<00:04:12.720> was

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
have been challenged enough if I was

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.479 
have been challenged enough if I was
trying<00:04:12.989> to<00:04:13.080> teach<00:04:13.230> myself<00:04:13.410> but<00:04:13.860> like<00:04:14.310> I<00:04:14.370> said

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489 
trying to teach myself but like I said

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:16.010 
trying to teach myself but like I said
that's<00:04:14.760> just<00:04:14.820> me<00:04:15.060> and<00:04:15.270> you<00:04:15.780> might<00:04:15.930> be

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:16.020 
that's just me and you might be

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:17.690 
that's just me and you might be
different<00:04:16.410> something<00:04:16.770> to<00:04:16.950> be<00:04:17.040> aware<00:04:17.130> of<00:04:17.310> if

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
different something to be aware of if

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.250 
different something to be aware of if
you<00:04:17.820> choose<00:04:18.000> the<00:04:18.120> self-taught<00:04:18.540> route<00:04:18.810> is<00:04:19.080> that

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
you choose the self-taught route is that

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.740 
you choose the self-taught route is that
often<00:04:19.620> job<00:04:19.830> listings<00:04:20.280> will<00:04:20.730> say<00:04:21.120> that<00:04:21.630> they
