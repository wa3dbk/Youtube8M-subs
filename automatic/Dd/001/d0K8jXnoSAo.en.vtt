00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:09.460 
satisfying it most the time ends up in
this<00:03:07.160> diamond<00:03:07.730> thing<00:03:08.269> where<00:03:08.600> you<00:03:09.019> start<00:03:09.350> off

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
this diamond thing where you start off

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.020 
this diamond thing where you start off
with<00:03:09.680> few<00:03:09.860> options<00:03:10.040> that<00:03:10.370> spreads<00:03:10.700> out<00:03:10.880> but

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
with few options that spreads out but

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.880 
with few options that spreads out but
eventually<00:03:11.150> comes<00:03:11.690> to<00:03:11.840> a<00:03:11.870> point<00:03:11.959> so<00:03:12.650> I'll<00:03:12.739> be

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
eventually comes to a point so I'll be

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.170 
eventually comes to a point so I'll be
very<00:03:13.070> interested<00:03:13.250> to<00:03:13.640> see<00:03:13.850> how<00:03:14.000> this
