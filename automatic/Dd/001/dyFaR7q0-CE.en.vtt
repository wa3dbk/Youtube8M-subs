00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.760
 in the past nothing more 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:15.750
 saints could play book at 7 and the 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:22.080
 stadium is full of pretext but more 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:24.960
 beyond this comment I think what 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.640
 happened today that we witnessed two 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.140
 teams or the two teams of the eight 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.189
 that there should not be is in the 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.610
 group that is simply 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.719
 qualified because the system so not 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.719
 I mean saints and pachuca 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:44.190
 because two teams are ready that are not 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.020
 they have merits they do not have the 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.489
 sizes did not do what is valid to be 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.020
 disputing a title 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.090
 the competition system the rule was 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.320
 what qualified them and there is the 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.510
 result but that is a bad message 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.390
 also use because it is bad 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.789
 understanding of the amateur that follows 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.930
 without channeling and still does not understand how 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.879
 Mexican soccer is played 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.619
 beyond that in the common place of the law 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.850
 is another tournament is a fact that today 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.890
 saints to have 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:14.909
 as the start of the match after before 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:19.619
 of which time the figure figure is 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:21.689
 the goalkeeper raised in the transmission 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.640
 of those who were the party 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.049
 they mentioned that tiger is the safest 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.500
 that the alternative team plays the one 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.810
 game I contract the problem so that the 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.310
 Tuesday that she gave me this word do 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:35.670
 with conmebol play the rooms of the 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:42.990
 end of the trip and on Thursday come again 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:44.880
 to play the semifinal and surely like that to 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.580
 from that Tuesday where he will play 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.289
 absolutely the majority of the key the 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.590
 tigueres team because apart 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:54.690
 you have to travel not on that trip if you take out 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.130
 a good result will be able to handle 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.229
 perfectly tuca times 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.580
 ferretti because because it came down he's going 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.899
 reach the best in any given case 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.560
 Exactly what you are going to do here is the 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:09.209
 picture that goes for Saturday is the one that 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.640
 supposedly it would be when the party 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.150
 of the semifinal and then it depends on the 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.000
 rest 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:19.319
 on Tuesday I would not be seeing with that 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:28.909
 would play the seemed upset is the 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:28.909
 match in which there are two teams 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:40.240
 America with the reigning teacher did it and 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:42.670
 15 years ago at least he played 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.700
 playoff or what are the rooms called 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:50.910
 end eighth of the liberators and 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.910
 after a night 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.910
 with which they recorded
