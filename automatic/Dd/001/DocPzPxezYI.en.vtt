00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
unscrew this it'll be a little washer in

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.779 
unscrew this it'll be a little washer in
there<00:00:49.320> be<00:00:49.469> sure<00:00:49.620> not<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.860> get<00:00:49.980> that<00:00:50.190> caught<00:00:50.520> in

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
there be sure not to get that caught in

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.029 
there be sure not to get that caught in
these<00:00:51.059> like<00:00:51.690> half<00:00:51.960> in<00:00:52.170> half<00:00:52.440> out<00:00:52.680> because

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
these like half in half out because

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.279 
these like half in half out because
that'll<00:00:53.309> bend<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:53.850> you<00:00:54.600> know<00:00:54.719> nobody

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289

that'll bend it and you know nobody
wants<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.559> break<00:00:55.739> anything<00:00:56.070> as<00:00:56.160> soon<00:00:56.250> as<00:00:56.370> they

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
wants to break anything as soon as they

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.680 
wants to break anything as soon as they
get<00:00:56.610> it<00:00:56.870> because<00:00:57.870> that's<00:00:57.989> never<00:00:58.230> fun<00:00:58.469> but<00:00:59.690> one

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
get it because that's never fun but one

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.200 
get it because that's never fun but one
side<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.079> this<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.469> more<00:01:02.219> relatively<00:01:02.730> square

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
side of this is more relatively square

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.870 
side of this is more relatively square
than<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.510> other<00:01:03.690> side<00:01:04.080> these<00:01:04.350> little<00:01:04.619> notches

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:04.880 
than the other side these little notches

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.690 
than the other side these little notches
and<00:01:05.880> you'll<00:01:06.090> notice<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:07.409> bottom<00:01:08.159> under

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
the head of this screw is squared so you

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.070 
the head of this screw is squared so you
find<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.880> adjustment<00:01:15.360> you<00:01:15.420> want<00:01:15.689> depending

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080
