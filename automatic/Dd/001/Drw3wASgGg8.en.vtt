00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
anyway that's why if the jet mode not

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:10.820 
anyway that's why if the jet mode not
really<00:01:09.840> much<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:09.960> talk<00:01:10.110> about<00:01:10.260> so<00:01:10.530> it's

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
really much to talk about so it's

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.830 
really much to talk about so it's
getting<00:01:10.979> transformed<00:01:11.310> into<00:01:11.670> here's<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.420> robot

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
getting transformed into here's a robot

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.480 
getting transformed into here's a robot
mode<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.500> transform<00:01:13.860> teradyne<00:01:14.220> we're<00:01:14.369> going

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
mode to transform teradyne we're going

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.520 
mode to transform teradyne we're going
to<00:01:14.580> do<00:01:14.700> is<00:01:14.909> going<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.270> come<00:01:15.360> back<00:01:15.509> here<00:01:15.750> lift

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
to do is going to come back here lift

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.850 
to do is going to come back here lift
this<00:01:16.619> up<00:01:16.830> like<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.590> just<00:01:19.590> sort<00:01:19.770> of

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
this up like that and just sort of

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.280 
this up like that and just sort of
rotate<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.369> legs<00:01:20.549> are<00:01:20.759> just<00:01:21.360> like<00:01:21.570> so<00:01:21.780> and

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
rotate the legs are just like so and

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.840 
rotate the legs are just like so and
grab<00:01:22.590> this<00:01:22.740> section<00:01:23.100> here<00:01:23.340> going<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.670> try<00:01:23.820> and

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
grab this section here going to try and

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.330 
grab this section here going to try and
pull<00:01:24.180> it<00:01:24.270> out<00:01:24.420> just<00:01:25.020> like<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.259> then<00:01:26.189> we<00:01:26.250> have

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
pull it out just like that then we have

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.149 
pull it out just like that then we have
to<00:01:26.430> sort<00:01:26.610> of<00:01:26.759> angle<00:01:27.090> this<00:01:27.540> forward<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.920> make

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
to sort of angle this forward and make

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.210 
to sort of angle this forward and make
sure<00:01:29.189> this<00:01:29.700> black<00:01:30.000> piece<00:01:30.240> ends<00:01:30.689> up<00:01:30.810> behind

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
sure this black piece ends up behind
