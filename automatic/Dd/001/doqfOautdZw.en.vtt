saw this little handy device it is
called<00:00:12.360> a<00:00:12.750> silicone<00:00:13.559> yoke<00:00:14.250> out<00:00:14.549> and<00:00:14.969> what<00:00:15.750> this

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
called a silicone yoke out and what this

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.160 
called a silicone yoke out and what this
is<00:00:16.170> supposed<00:00:16.650> to<00:00:16.800> do<00:00:17.100> is<00:00:17.750> separate<00:00:18.750> eggs

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
is supposed to do is separate eggs

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.609 
is supposed to do is separate eggs
really<00:00:19.710> easy<00:00:20.160> by<00:00:20.910> sucking<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:21.660> yolk<00:00:21.990> right

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
really easy by sucking the yolk right

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.880 
really easy by sucking the yolk right
out<00:00:22.890> of<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.130> whites<00:00:23.720> now<00:00:24.720> we're<00:00:25.380> going<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.650> put

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
out of the whites now we're going to put

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.130 
out of the whites now we're going to put
this<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.369> test<00:00:26.689> we're<00:00:27.689> going<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:27.930> use<00:00:28.109> a

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
this to the test we're going to use a

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.279 
this to the test we're going to use a
traditional<00:00:28.529> method<00:00:29.369> of<00:00:29.990> separating<00:00:30.990> an<00:00:31.109> egg

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
traditional method of separating an egg

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
and then we're going to test it against

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.530 
and then we're going to test it against
the<00:00:33.989> yolk<00:00:34.260> out<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:34.980> then<00:00:35.640> Eric's<00:00:36.300> got<00:00:36.510> a

I also separate my eggs my yolks for my

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:42.520 
I also separate my eggs my yolks for my
whites<00:01:40.640> in<00:01:41.030> my<00:01:41.240> waffle<00:01:41.899> recipe<00:01:42.110> if<00:01:42.440> you

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
whites in my waffle recipe if you

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.460 
whites in my waffle recipe if you
watched<00:01:42.770> my<00:01:42.950> video<00:01:43.700> on<00:01:43.910> making<00:01:44.470> homemade

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
watched my video on making homemade

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.889 
watched my video on making homemade
waffles<00:01:46.130> I<00:01:46.310> separated<00:01:46.970> the<00:01:47.119> whites<00:01:47.330> and<00:01:47.690> beat

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
waffles I separated the whites and beat

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:50.200 
waffles I separated the whites and beat
the<00:01:48.110> whites<00:01:48.320> separately<00:01:49.039> so<00:01:49.759> they're<00:01:49.970> nice

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
the whites separately so they're nice

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.930 
the whites separately so they're nice
and<00:01:50.240> fluffy<00:01:50.810> to<00:01:51.080> make<00:01:51.259> fluffy<00:01:51.710> waffles<00:01:51.940> so

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
and fluffy to make fluffy waffles so

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.420 
and fluffy to make fluffy waffles so
separating<00:01:53.720> eggs<00:01:53.960> is<00:01:54.259> very<00:01:54.500> important<00:01:55.280> and

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:55.430 
separating eggs is very important and

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.469 
separating eggs is very important and
it's<00:01:55.970> really<00:01:56.390> pretty<00:01:57.020> easy<00:01:57.350> to<00:01:57.680> do<00:01:58.000> by<00:01:59.000> hand

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
it's really pretty easy to do by hand

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.180 
it's really pretty easy to do by hand
and<00:01:59.810> I'll<00:01:59.899> show<00:02:00.050> you<00:02:00.080> how<00:02:00.289> to<00:02:00.380> do<00:02:00.530> that<00:02:00.679> by<00:02:00.860> hand

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:01.190 
and I'll show you how to do that by hand

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.180 
and I'll show you how to do that by hand
but<00:02:02.200> hopefully<00:02:03.200> this<00:02:03.350> will<00:02:03.410> make<00:02:03.740> the<00:02:03.920> task

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
but hopefully this will make the task

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.900 
but hopefully this will make the task
even<00:02:04.610> easier<00:02:05.179> so<00:02:05.509> I'm<00:02:05.690> gonna<00:02:05.869> go<00:02:06.110> ahead<00:02:06.259> and

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
even easier so I'm gonna go ahead and

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:12.490 
even easier so I'm gonna go ahead and
open<00:02:07.910> the<00:02:08.780> yolk<00:02:09.020> out<00:02:09.259> and<00:02:10.900> basically<00:02:11.900> what<00:02:12.319> it

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
open the yolk out and basically what it

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:20.710 
open the yolk out and basically what it
is<00:02:12.530> is<00:02:13.370> a<00:02:13.660> little<00:02:15.099> squishy<00:02:16.099> thing<00:02:16.599> with<00:02:17.599> a<00:02:19.720> top

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
is is a little squishy thing with a top

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.920 
is is a little squishy thing with a top
on<00:02:20.930> it<00:02:20.990> and<00:02:21.610> the<00:02:22.610> instructions<00:02:23.330> say<00:02:23.599> you<00:02:23.660> just

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
on it and the instructions say you just

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.199 
on it and the instructions say you just
put<00:02:24.349> it<00:02:24.470> right<00:02:24.590> down<00:02:25.130> onto<00:02:25.400> the<00:02:25.550> egg<00:02:25.819> you

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
put it right down onto the egg you

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.690 
put it right down onto the egg you
squeeze<00:02:26.599> and<00:02:27.050> you<00:02:27.530> draw<00:02:27.800> it<00:02:27.980> up<00:02:28.099> and<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.490> yolk

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
squeeze and you draw it up and the yolk

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
is supposed to come out so I'm gonna go

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.670 
is supposed to come out so I'm gonna go
ahead<00:02:31.430> and<00:02:31.760> wash<00:02:31.970> this<00:02:32.209> up<00:02:32.450> and<00:02:32.720> we're<00:02:33.560> gonna

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
ahead and wash this up and we're gonna

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.750 
ahead and wash this up and we're gonna
test<00:02:34.040> out<00:02:34.280> the<00:02:35.120> yolk<00:02:35.990> out<00:02:36.459> okay<00:02:37.459> the<00:02:37.610> first

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
test out the yolk out okay the first

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:38.920 
test out the yolk out okay the first
thing<00:02:38.000> we're<00:02:38.150> going<00:02:38.270> to<00:02:38.330> do<00:02:38.510> is<00:02:38.720> we're<00:02:38.900> going

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
thing we're going to do is we're going

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.729 
thing we're going to do is we're going
to<00:02:39.080> separate<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:39.860> egg<00:02:40.870> the<00:02:41.870> traditional<00:02:42.590> way

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
to separate the egg the traditional way

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:44.620 
to separate the egg the traditional way
and<00:02:43.040> pretty<00:02:43.340> much<00:02:43.520> to<00:02:43.760> do<00:02:43.910> that<00:02:44.090> you<00:02:44.360> just

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
and pretty much to do that you just

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.880 
and pretty much to do that you just
crack<00:02:45.410> the<00:02:45.620> egg<00:02:45.890> and<00:02:46.819> you're<00:02:47.060> gonna<00:02:47.180> separate

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
crack the egg and you're gonna separate

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.430 
crack the egg and you're gonna separate
the<00:02:48.890> two<00:02:49.130> sides<00:02:49.520> and<00:02:50.300> you're<00:02:50.599> basically<00:02:51.080> going

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
the two sides and you're basically going

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.510 
the two sides and you're basically going
to<00:02:51.880> take<00:02:52.880> the<00:02:53.090> yolk<00:02:53.390> from<00:02:54.349> side<00:02:54.620> to<00:02:54.650> side<00:02:55.130> until

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
to take the yolk from side to side until

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.100 
to take the yolk from side to side until
the<00:02:56.239> whites<00:02:57.520> fall<00:02:58.520> out<00:02:58.849> and<00:02:59.630> you<00:02:59.780> have<00:02:59.930> it

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
the whites fall out and you have it

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.460 
the whites fall out and you have it
perfectly<00:03:00.470> separated<00:03:01.010> yolk<00:03:01.610> now<00:03:02.050> it's<00:03:03.050> kind

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
perfectly separated yolk now it's kind

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.259 
perfectly separated yolk now it's kind
of<00:03:03.560> messy<00:03:04.069> so<00:03:05.030> let's<00:03:05.480> see<00:03:05.780> what<00:03:06.340> the<00:03:07.340> yolk<00:03:08.060> out

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
of messy so let's see what the yolk out

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:09.150 
of messy so let's see what the yolk out
can<00:03:08.599> do

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
can do

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.610 
can do
so<00:03:09.700> we're<00:03:10.030> going<00:03:10.150> to<00:03:10.210> crack<00:03:10.510> a<00:03:10.540> couple<00:03:10.900> eggs<00:03:11.290> in

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
so we're going to crack a couple eggs in

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.520 
so we're going to crack a couple eggs in
here<00:03:12.010> and<00:03:12.910> this<00:03:13.150> is<00:03:13.300> our<00:03:13.450> whites<00:03:13.780> that<00:03:14.200> we<00:03:14.350> use

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
here and this is our whites that we use

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.050 
here and this is our whites that we use
before<00:03:14.740> and<00:03:16.260> the<00:03:17.260> yolk<00:03:17.680> out<00:03:17.950> claims<00:03:18.490> that<00:03:18.880> it's

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
before and the yolk out claims that it's

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.950 
before and the yolk out claims that it's
gonna<00:03:19.210> suck<00:03:19.720> these<00:03:20.020> yolks<00:03:20.520> right<00:03:21.520> up<00:03:21.850> into<00:03:22.270> the

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:22.960 
gonna suck these yolks right up into the

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.860 
gonna suck these yolks right up into the
yolk<00:03:23.170> out<00:03:23.380> so<00:03:23.740> let's<00:03:23.980> see<00:03:24.250> here<00:03:25.090> we<00:03:25.240> go<00:03:25.420> yolk

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
yolk out so let's see here we go yolk

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.790 
yolk out so let's see here we go yolk

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
say that they can get the yolk out by

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.200 
say that they can get the yolk out by
using<00:04:16.420> an<00:04:16.750> empty<00:04:17.200> water<00:04:17.590> bottle<00:04:18.160> so<00:04:18.340> he's

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:19.210

using an empty water bottle so he's
gonna<00:04:19.390> try<00:04:19.720> his<00:04:20.020> method<00:04:20.470> to<00:04:20.620> see<00:04:20.799> if<00:04:20.890> it<00:04:21.040> works

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
gonna try his method to see if it works

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.350 
gonna try his method to see if it works
as<00:04:21.460> well<00:04:21.670> as<00:04:21.940> the<00:04:22.300> yolk<00:04:22.480> out<00:04:22.980> so<00:04:23.980> if<00:04:24.880> you<00:04:25.210> don't

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.360 
as well as the yolk out so if you don't

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.180 
as well as the yolk out so if you don't
feel<00:04:25.540> like<00:04:25.570> spending<00:04:25.870> five<00:04:26.740> or<00:04:26.860> six<00:04:27.010> dollars

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
feel like spending five or six dollars

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.370 
feel like spending five or six dollars
for<00:04:27.610> a<00:04:27.670> little<00:04:27.850> gadget<00:04:28.390> and<00:04:28.540> you've<00:04:28.870> got<00:04:29.080> this

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
for a little gadget and you've got this

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.920 
for a little gadget and you've got this
you<00:04:30.220> know<00:04:30.340> water<00:04:30.760> bottle<00:04:31.120> laying<00:04:31.300> around<00:04:31.450> or

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
you know water bottle laying around or

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.540 
you know water bottle laying around or
you<00:04:32.260> want<00:04:32.470> to<00:04:32.560> drink<00:04:32.830> a<00:04:33.040> bottle<00:04:33.190> of<00:04:33.370> water

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
you want to drink a bottle of water

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.130 
you want to drink a bottle of water
while<00:04:33.850> you're<00:04:33.970> getting<00:04:34.090> ingredients<00:04:34.870> going

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
while you're getting ingredients going

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.900 
while you're getting ingredients going
then<00:04:35.710> this<00:04:36.010> just<00:04:36.430> might<00:04:36.610> work

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
then this just might work

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.490 
then this just might work
but<00:04:37.240> let's<00:04:37.450> test<00:04:37.720> it<00:04:37.990> so<00:04:38.530> let<00:04:38.890> me<00:04:40.290> put<00:04:41.290> an<00:04:41.380> egg

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
but let's test it so let me put an egg

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:47.940 
but let's test it so let me put an egg
in<00:04:41.530> here<00:04:41.950> right<00:04:42.250> so<00:04:46.080> it's<00:04:47.080> very<00:04:47.200> dangerous<00:04:47.470> cuz

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
in here right so it's very dangerous cuz
