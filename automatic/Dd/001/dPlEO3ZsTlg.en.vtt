00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.609 
if you have a lot of photos that list
can<00:02:01.560> be<00:02:01.590> pretty<00:02:01.829> long<00:02:02.299> and<00:02:03.299> right<00:02:04.290> now<00:02:04.439> unless

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
can be pretty long and right now unless

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.940 
can be pretty long and right now unless
I'm<00:02:04.829> missing<00:02:05.219> something

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
I'm missing something

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.940 
I'm missing something
there's<00:02:07.950> no<00:02:08.250> way<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.429> sort<00:02:08.819> by<00:02:09.560> like<00:02:10.560> reverse

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
there's no way to sort by like reverse

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.979 
there's no way to sort by like reverse
order<00:02:11.190> sort<00:02:11.459> or<00:02:11.520> anything<00:02:11.670> like<00:02:11.819> that<00:02:11.879> so<00:02:12.209> I'm

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
order sort or anything like that so I'm

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.040 
order sort or anything like that so I'm
like<00:02:13.170> right<00:02:13.319> now<00:02:13.410> here<00:02:13.590> I'm<00:02:13.709> trying

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
like right now here I'm trying

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.380 
like right now here I'm trying
get<00:02:14.170> down<00:02:14.350> to<00:02:14.790> some<00:02:15.790> photos<00:02:16.090> that<00:02:16.240> I<00:02:16.300> took

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
get down to some photos that I took

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.860 
get down to some photos that I took
today<00:02:17.640> it<00:02:18.640> takes<00:02:18.850> a<00:02:18.940> while<00:02:19.060> because<00:02:19.420> the<00:02:19.540> dnl<00:02:19.840> a

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
today it takes a while because the dnl a

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.990 
today it takes a while because the dnl a
service<00:02:20.320> also<00:02:20.650> takes<00:02:21.400> a<00:02:21.460> moment<00:02:21.550> for<00:02:21.880> the

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
service also takes a moment for the

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.810 
service also takes a moment for the
pictures<00:02:22.720> to<00:02:22.750> stream<00:02:23.200> so<00:02:24.040> hopefully<00:02:24.580> they

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
pictures to stream so hopefully they

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.970 
pictures to stream so hopefully they
will<00:02:25.000> expand<00:02:25.390> it<00:02:25.540> so<00:02:25.660> that<00:02:25.840> rather<00:02:26.620> than<00:02:26.800> just

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
will expand it so that rather than just

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.430 
will expand it so that rather than just
having<00:02:27.100> all<00:02:27.400> photos<00:02:28.140> you'll<00:02:29.140> be<00:02:29.260> able<00:02:29.380> to

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
having all photos you'll be able to

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.180 
having all photos you'll be able to
output<00:02:29.740> just<00:02:30.010> certain<00:02:30.220> tags<00:02:31.710> but<00:02:32.710> you<00:02:33.700> can<00:02:33.850> see

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
output just certain tags but you can see

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.550 
output just certain tags but you can see
if<00:02:36.190> we<00:02:36.280> just<00:02:36.370> pick<00:02:37.300> a<00:02:37.360> photo<00:02:37.570> I<00:02:37.900> was<00:02:38.410> a<00:02:38.440> nice

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
if we just pick a photo I was a nice

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.030 
if we just pick a photo I was a nice
blurry<00:02:38.890> when<00:02:39.040> I<00:02:39.100> picked<00:02:39.340> for<00:02:39.550> you<00:02:40.890> these<00:02:41.890> were

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
blurry when I picked for you these were

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.410 
blurry when I picked for you these were
all<00:02:42.130> indoors<00:02:42.430> at<00:02:42.610> an<00:02:42.670> aquarium

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
all indoors at an aquarium

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.800 
all indoors at an aquarium
you<00:02:44.260> can<00:02:44.410> flip<00:02:44.650> through<00:02:45.000> all<00:02:46.000> your<00:02:46.210> photos<00:02:46.390> and

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
Droid X there like that that's what I

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.880 
Droid X there like that that's what I
was<00:03:13.690> going<00:03:13.810> for

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
was going for

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.740 
was going for
the<00:03:15.370> only<00:03:15.520> other<00:03:15.670> drawback<00:03:16.030> at<00:03:16.150> the<00:03:16.240> moment

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
the only other drawback at the moment

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:18.120 
the only other drawback at the moment
and<00:03:16.930> this<00:03:17.260> isn't<00:03:17.500> so<00:03:17.590> much<00:03:17.620> a<00:03:17.770> problem<00:03:17.890> the

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
and this isn't so much a problem the

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.250 
and this isn't so much a problem the
droids<00:03:18.459> as<00:03:19.120> much<00:03:19.330> as<00:03:19.420> a<00:03:19.450> problem<00:03:19.660> at<00:03:19.720> the<00:03:19.780> ps3

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
droids as much as a problem at the ps3

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.660 
droids as much as a problem at the ps3
and<00:03:20.440> the<00:03:20.500> 360<00:03:20.830> for<00:03:21.130> that<00:03:21.220> matter<00:03:21.630> under<00:03:22.630> video

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
and the 360 for that matter under video

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.920 
and the 360 for that matter under video
they<00:03:24.670> will<00:03:24.790> also<00:03:24.970> boost<00:03:25.270> the<00:03:25.420> unsupported

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
they will also boost the unsupported

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.660 
they will also boost the unsupported
data<00:03:26.110> and<00:03:26.470> that's<00:03:26.830> because<00:03:27.070> neither<00:03:27.430> of<00:03:27.610> these

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
data and that's because neither of these

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.590 
data and that's because neither of these
consoles<00:03:28.150> supported<00:03:28.690> the<00:03:28.750> 3gp<00:03:29.290> video

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
consoles supported the 3gp video

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.420 
consoles supported the 3gp video
container<00:03:31.600> that<00:03:32.080> pretty<00:03:32.950> much<00:03:33.010> all<00:03:33.190> cell

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
container that pretty much all cell

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.160 
container that pretty much all cell
phones<00:03:33.459> use<00:03:33.850> so<00:03:34.060> hopefully<00:03:34.360> in<00:03:34.510> a<00:03:34.690> forthcoming

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
phones use so hopefully in a forthcoming

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.040 
phones use so hopefully in a forthcoming
firmware<00:03:35.920> we'll<00:03:36.130> see<00:03:36.250> Sony<00:03:36.580> and<00:03:37.050> Microsoft

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.050 
firmware we'll see Sony and Microsoft

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.750 
firmware we'll see Sony and Microsoft
for<00:03:38.140> that<00:03:38.230> matter<00:03:38.760> have<00:03:40.530> support<00:03:41.530> for<00:03:42.220> the<00:03:42.310> 3gp

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.709 
and you don't even have to hook up any
wires
