 bring some recipes of these that do 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.420
 that is mouth water and is that I have 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.610
 thought of a recipe that surely more 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.530
 of one you will love today I will do 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.680
 some delicious mozzarella sticks 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.690
 but not with any recipe today 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.879
 I'm going to do them to the batteries and the gas 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.070
 I want they are still more good than 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:59.899
 mozzarella sticks in short and for this 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.780
 recipe the ingredients that we need 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:06.270
 because they are the next two eggs 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:09.580
 a little bad ojito of fresh parsley 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:13.840
 a teaspoon of dried oregano 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:17.320
 a teaspoon of basil 250 grams 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:22.090
 of bread crumbs 500 grams of mozzarella 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:26.440
 fresh a pinch of salt 30 grams of 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:29.740
 cornstarch 150 grams of wheat flour and 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.750
 a teaspoon of both powder is already 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.410
 with this we can start to perform 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.410
 our recipe 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.160
 ah 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.100
 The first thing I have done is to pack 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.140
 the cupcakes and now what I'm going to 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.670
 to do is to drain all the moisture that 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.590
 have this way what I'm going to do in 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.500
 a sieve for if you have something that goes 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.690
 falling down and now with the help of a 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.330
 napkin I'm going to finish drying 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:05.060
 so that it is as close as possible to 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.650
 this way once the manzanera has dried 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.929
 what we are going to do is cut it in 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:12.200
 little sticks for it in half the 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:14.960
 let's cut this way up and 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.410
 now well along we are doing 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:20.450
 our mozzarella sticks now 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.120
 let's catch you have a little story come on 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:28.350
 to crack what are the two eggs 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:31.020
 let's throw here the first the second 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:34.710
 and perfect with care that we do not know 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:37.890
 drop the shell and go now we 're going to 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.600
 Beat everything very well once beaten 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.020
 the eggs we are going to add 50 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.970
 milliliters of water in this way and let's 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.430
 to keep beating and recording everything very 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.690
 well now we will take the handful of 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:53.580
 parsley and we're going to nibble it very well 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.380
 now let's take the breadcrumbs and 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.750
 let's add the different spices 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.990
 for example the spoonful of basil 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:04.250
 dry in this way we are also going to 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:07.880
 add what is oregano 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:12.310
 and it goes perfect is also added the 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.310
 fresh parsley that does not miss 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:17.770
 over there a little more that is left 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.770
 here 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:24.319
 perfect we will also do what 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:27.650
 It is the spoonful of garlic powder 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:29.629
 and if we cast it perfect and the only thing 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.870
 What we have left is to add what is the 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:31.870
 Salt 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:36.380
 a bit more because they are for quite 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.500
 they are ready perfect and we are going to 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:42.500
 mix everything very well now we have stopped 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.600
 on a plate what are the 150 grams of 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.390
 flour and the 30 grams the medicine and what 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.130
 let's mix everything very well now 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.900
 we'll take the mozzarella sticks 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.660
 and we will follow the following process 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:57.709
 first egg we re wet it well in the 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:04:01.489
 egg now bread shredded must be lame 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:05.090
 well all the perfect breadcrumbs and for 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:08.120
 Last the flour with the cornstarch above 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:10.610
 you have to cover them well everything is 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.920
 important that it is well coated and 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.630
 once we have the coated stick what 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.060
 let's reserve to put it in the 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.470
 fryers once we have already battered our 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.780
 mozzarella sticks what are we going to 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.820
 to do is bring it in the oil for it 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.950
 we have thrown in a good fryer 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.110
 amount of oil we have not put to 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.900
 heat pretty strong more or less to 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.970
 a temperature of 170 degrees and we 're going 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.639
 to go putting the sticks the sticks 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.560
 they have to go approximately for 30 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:37.340
 seconds nothing else is practically poking 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.860
 And take out 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:42.590
 and we will place it on a plate with paper 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:45.710
 of cooking so that it absorbs the excess 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.660
 of oil so that they do not stick 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.280
 put the little sticks little by little in fact 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.320
 I have separated it and what I am going to do 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.060
 now it is to submerge it so that they are made 

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.160
 all right 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.930
 and well we have ready in our 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.610
 mozzarella sticks I opened one 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.310
 so you can see all the melted cheese 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:04.130
 this one that I love the truth is that in 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:05.690
 this dish the cheese is the protagonist and 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.940
 with the favor of the fine herbs the 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:10.790
 truth is that it is tremendous because the 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:13.610
 taste is unbeatable in fact I am 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:15.830
 a cheese fanatic to me this dish 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.169
 It drives me crazy and if I do everything also 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:20.330
 like cheese this dish will drive you crazy 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:22.460

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:24.139
