00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
you I had to do some advanced custom

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.310 
you I had to do some advanced custom
techniques<00:00:44.820> which<00:00:45.090> involve<00:00:45.450> soaking

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
techniques which involve soaking

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.020 
techniques which involve soaking
something<00:00:46.800> in<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:46.980> hot<00:00:47.160> water<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.879> then

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
something in the hot water and then

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.970 
something in the hot water and then
using<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:49.460> screwdriver<00:00:50.460> sharp<00:00:51.420> tool<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:52.590> pry

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
using a screwdriver sharp tool to pry

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.310 
using a screwdriver sharp tool to pry
joints<00:00:53.730> out<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:55.399> some<00:00:56.399> gluing<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.320> stuff

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
joints out and some gluing and stuff

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.260 
joints out and some gluing and stuff
like<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.559> because<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.309> actually<00:00:59.460> had<00:00:59.789> to<00:01:00.000> make

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
like that because I actually had to make

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.170 
like that because I actually had to make
I<00:01:00.859> had<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:01.980> take<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:04.489> Walter<00:01:05.489> Gundams<00:01:05.880> arm

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
I had to take the Walter Gundams arm

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.260 
I had to take the Walter Gundams arm
joints<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:06.990> swap<00:01:07.890> them<00:01:08.070> out<00:01:08.220> with<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.850> zig<00:01:09.030> ox

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
joints and swap them out with the zig ox

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.929 
joints and swap them out with the zig ox
arm<00:01:09.600> joints<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.229> let<00:01:10.380> me<00:01:10.530> tell<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:10.799> that<00:01:11.100> was

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
arm joints and let me tell you that was

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.780 
arm joints and let me tell you that was
a<00:01:12.360> lot<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:13.080> work<00:01:13.650> i<00:01:13.830> think<00:01:14.070> one<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.460> docs

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
a lot of work i think one of the docs

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.210 
a lot of work i think one of the docs
arm<00:01:15.090> joint<00:01:15.299> even<00:01:15.630> broke<00:01:15.960> was<00:01:16.200> doing<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.740> which

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
arm joint even broke was doing it which

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.039 
arm joint even broke was doing it which
may<00:01:17.369> even<00:01:17.640> more<00:01:17.970> work<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.390> try<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.659> pull<00:01:18.930> it

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
may even more work to try and pull it

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.390 
may even more work to try and pull it
out<00:01:19.170> Oh<00:01:20.270> hard<00:01:21.270> work<00:01:21.479> but<00:01:21.840> well<00:01:22.350> worth<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.830> my

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
out Oh hard work but well worth it my

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.480 
out Oh hard work but well worth it my
idea<00:01:23.729> um<00:01:24.119> just<00:01:24.840> another<00:01:25.140> variation<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:26.009> Zeon's

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
idea um just another variation of Zeon's

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.429 
idea um just another variation of Zeon's
amphibious<00:01:27.210> forces<00:01:27.630> they<00:01:27.990> put<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.200> lot<00:01:28.380> of

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
amphibious forces they put a lot of

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.740 
amphibious forces they put a lot of
stock<00:01:28.770> in<00:01:28.799> their<00:01:29.159> variants<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:29.970> always<00:01:30.540> work

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
stock in their variants and always work

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.710 
stock in their variants and always work
out<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:30.960> way<00:01:31.140> they<00:01:31.350> wanted<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.970> but<00:01:32.970> uh<00:01:33.000> the

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
out the way they wanted to but uh the

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.469 
out the way they wanted to but uh the
kept<00:01:33.930> hoping<00:01:34.400> can't<00:01:35.400> get<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:35.610> good<00:01:35.790> xeon<00:01:36.150> down

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
kept hoping can't get a good xeon down

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.469 
kept hoping can't get a good xeon down
that's<00:01:37.110> for<00:01:37.350> sure<00:01:37.850> so<00:01:38.850> it's<00:01:38.939> got<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.210> still

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
that's for sure so it's got the still

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.780 
that's for sure so it's got the still
missile<00:01:39.810> pods<00:01:40.020> in<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.259> head<00:01:40.530> i<00:01:40.799> have<00:01:41.610> some

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
missile pods in the head i have some

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.560 
missile pods in the head i have some
extra<00:01:42.150> thrusters<00:01:42.689> there<00:01:43.340> to<00:01:44.340> help<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.790> it's

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
extra thrusters there to help it it's

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.620 
extra thrusters there to help it it's
got<00:01:45.840> bigger<00:01:46.200> feet<00:01:46.640> to<00:01:47.640> help<00:01:48.060> it<00:01:48.240> keep<00:01:48.420> its

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
got bigger feet to help it keep its

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.530 
got bigger feet to help it keep its
balance<00:01:48.930> and<00:01:49.439> these<00:01:50.189> arms<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:51.030> idea<00:01:51.390> is<00:01:51.479> that

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
balance and these arms the idea is that

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.289 
balance and these arms the idea is that
they<00:01:51.840> would<00:01:52.020> retract<00:01:53.119> so<00:01:54.119> they're

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
they would retract so they're

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:01.539 
they would retract so they're
retractable<00:01:55.229> arms<00:01:57.170> like<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.439> op<00:01:59.159> guy<00:01:59.520> and

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
retractable arms like the op guy and

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:07.520 
retractable arms like the op guy and
also<00:02:03.619> they<00:02:04.619> open<00:02:05.040> up<00:02:06.020> so<00:02:07.020> they<00:02:07.140> could<00:02:07.200> first

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
also they open up so they could first

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.520 
also they open up so they could first
off<00:02:07.770> they<00:02:08.489> could<00:02:08.700> be<00:02:08.789> a<00:02:08.819> stabbing<00:02:09.450> weapon<00:02:09.869> so

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
off they could be a stabbing weapon so

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.930 
off they could be a stabbing weapon so
they<00:02:10.649> could<00:02:10.800> probably<00:02:11.069> stab<00:02:11.520> through<00:02:11.910> a

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
they could probably stab through a

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.850 
they could probably stab through a
mobile<00:02:12.120> suit<00:02:12.480> just<00:02:12.690> like<00:02:12.900> this<00:02:13.410> could

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
mobile suit just like this could

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.339 
mobile suit just like this could
you<00:02:14.129> know<00:02:15.739> but<00:02:16.739> it's<00:02:17.010> also<00:02:17.690> high<00:02:18.690> power<00:02:18.959> laser

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
you know but it's also high power laser

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:23.570 
you know but it's also high power laser
in<00:02:19.680> each<00:02:19.830> hand<00:02:20.220> and<00:02:20.599> so<00:02:21.599> that<00:02:22.410> that<00:02:23.129> makes<00:02:23.400> it

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
in each hand and so that that makes it

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.630 
in each hand and so that that makes it
pretty<00:02:23.790> cool<00:02:24.120> and<00:02:24.709> the<00:02:25.709> retractable<00:02:26.250> Atia<00:02:26.580> of

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
pretty cool and the retractable Atia of

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.360 
pretty cool and the retractable Atia of
the<00:02:26.700> arms<00:02:27.680> makes<00:02:28.680> it<00:02:30.230> quite<00:02:31.230> good<00:02:31.560> for<00:02:31.950> moving

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
the arms makes it quite good for moving

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.410 
the arms makes it quite good for moving
in<00:02:32.489> the<00:02:32.580> water<00:02:33.140> less<00:02:34.140> resistance<00:02:35.209> the<00:02:36.209> only

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
in the water less resistance the only

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.940 
in the water less resistance the only
bad<00:02:36.569> thing<00:02:36.629> about<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.170> Walter<00:02:37.500> Gundam<00:02:37.800> is

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
bad thing about the Walter Gundam is

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.850 
bad thing about the Walter Gundam is
that<00:02:38.129> these<00:02:39.019> fingers<00:02:40.019> tend<00:02:40.319> to<00:02:40.410> come<00:02:40.590> off<00:02:42.860> and

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
that these fingers tend to come off and

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.640 
that these fingers tend to come off and
it's<00:02:44.010> not<00:02:44.280> often<00:02:44.640> that<00:02:45.239> I<00:02:45.420> get<00:02:45.569> Walter<00:02:46.440> getting

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
it's not often that I get Walter getting

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.020 
it's not often that I get Walter getting
them<00:02:46.739> spare<00:02:47.040> parts<00:02:47.430> and<00:02:47.580> things<00:02:47.610> but<00:02:47.879> yeah

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
them spare parts and things but yeah

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.600 
them spare parts and things but yeah
these<00:02:48.209> feet<00:02:48.480> help<00:02:48.780> it<00:02:48.959> put<00:02:49.800> the<00:02:49.890> pose<00:02:50.160> a<00:02:50.190> little

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
these feet help it put the pose a little

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.430 
these feet help it put the pose a little
bit<00:02:50.730> better<00:02:50.879> you<00:02:51.239> could<00:02:51.660> see<00:02:51.900> how<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.200> arms

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
bit better you could see how the arms

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.009 
bit better you could see how the arms
would<00:02:52.769> retract<00:02:53.390> it<00:02:54.390> looked<00:02:54.510> kind<00:02:54.720> of<00:02:54.750> silly

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
would retract it looked kind of silly

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.839 
would retract it looked kind of silly
like<00:02:55.290> that<00:02:55.319> but<00:02:55.800> if<00:02:55.920> it<00:02:56.069> was<00:02:56.160> moving<00:02:56.519> under<00:02:56.730> the

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
like that but if it was moving under the

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.140 
like that but if it was moving under the
water<00:02:57.319> you<00:02:58.319> know<00:02:58.470> then<00:02:58.830> uh<00:02:58.860> having<00:02:59.819> the<00:02:59.970> arm

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
water you know then uh having the arm

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.210 
water you know then uh having the arm
smaller<00:03:00.720> and<00:03:01.080> not<00:03:01.200> so<00:03:01.440> long<00:03:01.680> would<00:03:01.950> be<00:03:02.069> very

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
smaller and not so long would be very

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.880 
smaller and not so long would be very
helpful<00:03:02.489> in<00:03:03.050> fact<00:03:04.050> I<00:03:04.440> think<00:03:05.239> me<00:03:06.239> see<00:03:06.540> I<00:03:06.830> think<00:03:07.830> I

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
helpful in fact I think me see I think I

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.880 
helpful in fact I think me see I think I
might<00:03:08.040> have<00:03:08.069> even<00:03:08.280> designed<00:03:08.760> it<00:03:08.970> so<00:03:09.239> that<00:03:09.269> the

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
might have even designed it so that the

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.170 
might have even designed it so that the
arm<00:03:10.890> came<00:03:11.340> out<00:03:11.959> no<00:03:12.959> no<00:03:13.349> I<00:03:13.379> didn't<00:03:14.000> it<00:03:15.000> was<00:03:15.120> a

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
arm came out no no I didn't it was a

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.729 
arm came out no no I didn't it was a
good<00:03:15.269> idea<00:03:15.330> but<00:03:15.659> it<00:03:16.110> didn't<00:03:16.379> work<00:03:16.530> out<00:03:16.680> very

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
good idea but it didn't work out very

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:22.009 
good idea but it didn't work out very
well<00:03:18.230> but<00:03:19.230> yeah<00:03:19.379> that's<00:03:19.800> mais<00:03:20.159> okok<00:03:20.760> i<00:03:21.150> hope

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
well but yeah that's mais okok i hope

you like it hope you enjoyed the review
it<00:03:25.140> wasn't<00:03:25.470> very<00:03:25.560> hard<00:03:25.799> to<00:03:25.980> build<00:03:26.190> it<00:03:26.760> wasn't

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
it wasn't very hard to build it wasn't

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.449 
it wasn't very hard to build it wasn't
it<00:03:27.269> wasn't<00:03:27.450> the<00:03:27.780> hard<00:03:27.989> water<00:03:28.170> hot<00:03:28.950> water<00:03:28.980> trick

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
it wasn't the hard water hot water trick

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.479 
it wasn't the hard water hot water trick
works<00:03:29.730> quite<00:03:30.090> well<00:03:30.890> took<00:03:31.890> some<00:03:32.099> creativity

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
works quite well took some creativity

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.210 
works quite well took some creativity
anyone<00:03:32.940> else<00:03:33.120> could<00:03:33.330> build<00:03:33.569> this<00:03:33.810> i<00:03:34.080> think<00:03:35.010> i

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
anyone else could build this i think i

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.270 
anyone else could build this i think i
did<00:03:35.400> was<00:03:35.700> i<00:03:35.730> cut<00:03:36.030> a<00:03:36.060> little<00:03:36.209> hole<00:03:36.690> in<00:03:37.140> there<00:03:37.349> so

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
did was i cut a little hole in there so

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.820 
did was i cut a little hole in there so
i<00:03:38.310> could<00:03:38.580> glue<00:03:38.819> this<00:03:39.030> on<00:03:39.290> i'm<00:03:40.290> not<00:03:40.470> really<00:03:40.709> sure

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
i could glue this on i'm not really sure

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.680 
i could glue this on i'm not really sure
how<00:03:41.340> much<00:03:41.519> i<00:03:41.700> like<00:03:41.909> that<00:03:42.180> but<00:03:42.540> it<00:03:42.659> was

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
how much i like that but it was

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.839 
how much i like that but it was
different<00:03:43.080> and<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.830> Greens<00:03:44.099> kind<00:03:44.580> of<00:03:44.670> went

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:44.849 
different and the Greens kind of went

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:48.410 
different and the Greens kind of went
together<00:03:45.260> just<00:03:46.260> a<00:03:46.409> little<00:03:46.440> bit<00:03:46.909> the<00:03:47.909> blues<00:03:48.150> of

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
together just a little bit the blues of

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.690 
together just a little bit the blues of
the<00:03:48.510> feet<00:03:48.750> wanted<00:03:49.709> to<00:03:49.769> get<00:03:49.890> I<00:03:49.950> wanted<00:03:50.400> to<00:03:50.489> have

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
the feet wanted to get I wanted to have

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.780 
the feet wanted to get I wanted to have
a<00:03:50.730> better<00:03:51.480> stance<00:03:52.080> a<00:03:52.470> little<00:03:52.560> better<00:03:53.340> center

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
a better stance a little better center

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.429 
a better stance a little better center
of<00:03:53.970> gravity<00:03:54.510> since<00:03:54.900> it<00:03:55.049> was<00:03:55.140> going<00:03:55.290> to<00:03:55.349> have

00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:55.439 
of gravity since it was going to have

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:59.000 
of gravity since it was going to have
such<00:03:55.709> long<00:03:55.980> arms<00:03:56.459> for<00:03:56.700> posing<00:03:57.150> and<00:03:57.709> those<00:03:58.709> arms

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
such long arms for posing and those arms

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.720 
such long arms for posing and those arms
can<00:03:59.189> get<00:03:59.310> pretty<00:03:59.459> long<00:04:00.799> just<00:04:01.799> to<00:04:01.890> show<00:04:02.580> them

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
can get pretty long just to show them

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.640 
can get pretty long just to show them
with<00:04:02.909> short<00:04:03.540> arms<00:04:03.959> because<00:04:04.230> I<00:04:04.349> think<00:04:04.409> it's

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
with short arms because I think it's

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.270 
with short arms because I think it's
kind<00:04:04.830> of<00:04:04.890> cool<00:04:05.040> that<00:04:05.099> way

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.270 

I'll<00:04:10.280> put<00:04:10.490> my<00:04:10.640> fingers<00:04:11.440> back<00:04:12.440> together<00:04:12.830> since

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
I'll put my fingers back together since

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.640 
I'll put my fingers back together since
the<00:04:13.720> Walter<00:04:14.720> Gundam<00:04:14.990> fingers<00:04:15.320> they<00:04:15.470> just

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
the Walter Gundam fingers they just

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:23.620 
the Walter Gundam fingers they just
don't<00:04:15.940> stay<00:04:16.940> on<00:04:17.090> that<00:04:17.330> well<00:04:21.670> yeah<00:04:22.670> so<00:04:23.450> yeah

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
don't stay on that well yeah so yeah

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.950 
don't stay on that well yeah so yeah
that's<00:04:23.870> the<00:04:24.190> that's<00:04:25.190> the<00:04:25.370> short<00:04:26.180> arm<00:04:26.360> version

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
that's the that's the short arm version

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.740 
that's the that's the short arm version
right<00:04:27.140> there<00:04:27.790> still<00:04:28.790> looks<00:04:29.120> pretty<00:04:29.240> menacing

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
right there still looks pretty menacing

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.620 
right there still looks pretty menacing
and<00:04:30.260> pretty<00:04:30.500> cool<00:04:30.800> we<00:04:31.730> could<00:04:31.880> still<00:04:32.150> fire<00:04:32.360> its

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
and pretty cool we could still fire its

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:38.830 
and pretty cool we could still fire its
laser<00:04:32.930> that<00:04:33.770> way<00:04:36.220> well<00:04:37.220> that's<00:04:37.820> my<00:04:38.180> review<00:04:38.420> I
